I happily took him in the 4th round (amazingly got gronk in the 2nd round) and went on to win my league.  I'm hoping Drew Brees is the latest QB that everyone decides to sleep on.

Toon started to show signs of progress after cooks went down especially in the pittsburg game.  Joe morgan undoubtedly has big play ability, it's just a matter of consistency and staying on the field. And there's no telling what kind of potential Coleman and Jones have also there is   RJ Harris who's a UDFA who made some nice graps in minicamp.  So i'd say the competition for WR is pretty good as it is."

Saints,3e0tlu,steamerslane,2,Tue Jul 21 03:14:09 2015 UTC,I'd say wait until a couple weeks of preseason are in the books and we figure what we really have at receiver with the young guys. We know what we'll be getting with James Jones. No need to have him battling for roster spot for no reason if young guys are going to step like we all hope.

I think we'll be alright with the receivers we have, but Jones would bring another veteran presence to a very young WR corps that's full of question marks.

What is was is a Seattle local TV interview at a charity softball game. He is trying to be a nice guy at a charity event to please the crowd. That is a biased context and yet the reporters who are ""not hacks"" phrased that tweet in such a way that it seems like it was just a straight up question.   It's a media snafu for sure, but damn the Seattle media is in full off season mode with shoddy reporting for headlines like this. I guess when you didn't win the Superbowl last year you need to drum up interest in the team however you can get it. No parades or statewide tour's to talk about during the off season.   Just to give you a bit of ""context"" about me. I'm a Saints fan from Seattle who is fucking tired of ignorant,smug bandwagoning  Seattle fans who know nothing about football, sports, or the NFL; who try and lecture me about how they are the ""12th Man"" (Stolen) or responds to any criticism of their team with ""Go Hawks!"". It's a city full of transplants who started supporting the Seahawks because it became once they started winning it was the ""hip"" thing to do. I walk Seattle every day and I often wonder where are the Matt Hasselback or Shaun Alexander jerseys? No everyone either has a player from the past 4 years or the number 12 with Man on the back (again Stolen). Seattle tries so hard to be this unique mecca of football, but everything that Seattle fans laud about is not-unique or just plain stolen.   Now some smug NOLA report could post a tweet saying ""Present no context other than what it was, ThePuckeringBrown said that the Seattle media is being unfair.""     edit: wording"

Where they grew up, where they went to school, and their first team. So what if he wants to go back to Seattle. How many players actually live in the city they play in full time?

The problem for us was that Drew always forced it to him, which led to picks, etc. I think this trade helped both teams in that aspect."
Saints,3duflo,LessLikeYou,2,Mon Jul 20 00:15:45 2015 UTC,He also kind of sucks at blocking and wasn't showing any signs of improvement.
Saints,3duflo,M3rc_Nate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:28:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was what I assume people/the Saints mean't when they said The Saints were better when he was out injured or w/e. That Brees then spread the ball around and didn't focus so much on Jimmy which was better for your offense.   Injury prone I don't know, but I like this Canal Street Chronicles article about it. 249 Saints fans voted they think he just needs to be mentored to be taught how to play tough. Who better than the Seahawks Defense who famously could hold him to basically nothing using our Linebackers?   Now in camp and practice he gets to go up against our guys, and from the interviews i have seen i think our guys really really like him (he is extremely likable and has a heartbreaking past) so i don't think they will bully him and break him mentally. Instead help him develop so he can block effectively and play physically and beat physical DB's and LB's and stay tough mentally."
Saints,3duflo,SteakWay,2,Mon Jul 20 00:26:16 2015 UTC,I hate your extremely good team even more now. /s  Do you guys have a replacement for Unger?
Saints,3duflo,M3rc_Nate,2,Mon Jul 20 00:33:18 2015 UTC,"Lol you're gonna hate us more. Unger is a really damn good Center, but he gets injured a lot and worse, heals slowly. At a recent ""Seahawks Town Hall"" (fans can go to facility, and the coaches talk to the fans and give presentations, its really cool) our O-line and assistant head coach had this to say:   Regarding losing Max Unger:    This game is brutal, it can beat you up a little bit then all of a sudden you can't go out there, and you aren't in the huddle enough and all that. It's the tough decisions. Its life as you know it in the NFL, if your body can't stay right and keep you on the field then someone else is going to play. It is what you is, you don't like it, but you accept it and move forward.  What is has done however (losing Max) has created an amazing competition at Center. We've got a number of guys right now; Lem, Drew Nowak, Patrick, Sokoli, Pericak, we've got a lot of guys going on and Coach (Carroll) and I talk about this every other day. We are getting close to dialing this thing in and turning this into a 2 to 3 man competition. We are going to have a heck of a Center, because we have some awesome candidates.   My personal takeaway from what he said and how it was said was this:    It sounds like Max wasn't holding up health wise, and is breaking down. What I take from that is they see his future filled with more injuries, (I've personally noticed he's slow to heal), and his body is on the decline (and he's only getting older). Reminds me of when a report comes out on a RB Draft prospect being described as having just 1 contract worth of life in his legs/knees. Sounds like the Hawks don't expect Max to play 13+ games a season for multiple seasons hitting 30+ years old still in the league. That his best play and health is behind him. AKA he is deteriorating not sustaining.    As for our replacement, we should be alright going into 2015. Patrick Lewis filled in for Unger in '14 and did a solid job, Lem (a backup Center we have used a bunch over the years) is also decent-to-solid. The other guys we just don't know too well. Overall it does seem to be a great competition that will result in the best guy getting the job and getting a ton of preseason reps which will help him.   But, what is truly exciting is the player we drafted in this '15 draft. We drafted a Defensive Tackle named Kristjan Sokoli and are converting him to be our Center, and he is the freakiest athlete. Sokoli has the 2nd highest SPARQ score of any player in Zach Whitman's database of 2015 players that were not invited to the Combine.  In fact, Sokoli is a top 10 SPARQ player of any player in any position in this year's Draft (behind only Vic Beasley, Davis Tull, Chris Conley, Byron Jones and a WR/KR from Maine named Damarr Aultman).  He is a freak athlete beast, and if he can learn to play O-line (which we have done before, J.R. Sweezy is a D-line to O-line convert) for us he will be a monster and our starting franchise Center."
Saints,3duflo,SteakWay,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:23 2015 UTC,"You guys have to have the best front office in the league.   I don't know how well that offensive line will hold up, but Wilson will perform either way.   I'm just glad we got rid of Graham and his contract. Brees can spread the ball around a little bit more. Our offense would have been fine in the playoffs last season, but defense was atrocious. It's defense I'm worried about and will make us or break us this season.  Thanks for the info on your center situation. Sokoli sounds like an absolute monster. I'm sure one of those players will do well for you guys."
Saints,3duflo,M3rc_Nate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think we will be solid at Center, LT will be what its always been (Okung), LG will be an upgrade (now Bailey), RG will be J.R. Sweezy who being a D-line convert now has another full season under his belt, and RT is Justin Britt who was a really good run blocker, but the worst RT in the NFL at pass-protection (literally, per PFF) but he now has a entire season of experience under his belt, and an entire preseason camp to develop more.   So yeah i think we will be just fine.   Yeah I can totally see how getting rid of Jimmy could help your team. That contract was big, he got too much attention from Brees. Now hopefully you got a pro-bowl Center all season protecting Brees and blocking for your RB's, along with the 1st round player you got, and hopefully your D improves. I didn't like seeing the Saints fall from glory so much last year. A NFL without Brees is a sad NFL."

Saints,3duflo,israelearthcancer,0,Mon Jul 20 14:42:19 2015 UTC,You just traded an injury prone pro bowl center for an injury prone pro bowl TE. I dont hate you at all.
Saints,3duflo,M3rc_Nate,2,Mon Jul 20 04:35:41 2015 UTC,"While I imagine he played games injured, Jimmy was active for 78 out of 80 games in his career in NO. Max on the other hand started and played in 67 out of 97 games in his career. So i'll take 2 games out over 30 games out, along with Max looking to be (in our FO's opinion) on the decline in terms of health, and Max being a Center which is a much more significant piece to a team than a TE.   But thanks, i honestly hope our FO is wrong and Max has more full seasons of game in him for Brees to enjoy."
Saints,3duflo,israelearthcancer,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:43:45 2015 UTC,Jimmy played all but like 2 games injured. And it showed.

Saints,3duflo,DarkSquareBishop,4,Mon Jul 20 05:35:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly the contract is most likely a lowball. He's coming off a big injury, and Saints just unloaded an overpaid TE.

The most yards he's had in a season is 3,475, for fucks sake.  His job is to just not turn the ball over.  The most touchdowns he's scored passing is 26, goddamn it.  That's sliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiightly under average for a regular starting quarterback.  The dude has just not been required to do much.  His TD:INT ratio during his career has been slightly under 3:1.  If our boys were on the Seahawks, they'd get 4:1 AT LEAST.  Our teams have a ""You're our quarterback.  You're our centerpiece to this 53-man roster.  You are our leader"" strategy.  Seahawks is ""here you go.  We give you an elite run game and an elite defense.  Don't fuck it up.""

The Seahawks have a formula for winning games: play great defense and run the ball, so his volume stats will be lower than a slinger on a bad team. This doesn't mean that Wilson is the ""last link"" to the team though. He's very efficient at taking what the defense gives him, and he's a huge running threat in the backfield. With an average QB the Seahawks are still good, but they're not the powerhouse they've become with Wilson.  You put Wilson on a team with great receiving weapons and a shitty defense, he puts up the volume stats that people criticize him for lacking. It's just not needed in Seattle."

Saints,3diev2,lsmucker,14,Thu Jul 16 15:01:02 2015 UTC,"Cowboys and Saints side-by-side comparison  These are all raw stats pulled directly from NFL.com and have nothing to do with judgment or an eye test like PFF and FO. If the Saints were as bad blocking as we were led to believe, it should show up somewhere in the stat sheet.   The Saints were No. 1 in yards from scrimmage. You can't do that with a bad offensive line. Brees is one of the all time greats, but he’s not magic. If the line was so bad, he’d suffer somewhere statistically, but he didn’t. Yes, the Cowboys were the more successful team, but I think it had more to do with the differences of the Cowboys’ and Saints’ defenses and not their offenses.   But if you look at the statistics and break them down into averages, a whole different narrative shows up that goes totally against the media and /r/nfl sentiment. You have to look at averages because the Saints pass more than the Cowboys and the Cowboys run more. You also have to look at the quality of QB too. Yes, Brees is a hall of famer, but so is Romo if he keeps up his pace. Brees gets the nod, but it’s not like Romo is the type of QB that makes his line worse. They were both excellent QBs last season so I don’t think one gave the line an advantage over the other, and if they did, it was only slight.   Running backs are the same too. Murray is in the argument as the best back in the NFL, and Ingram is just not there yet. Just look at the difference of contracts they signed this offseason to show who is the better back. But like Brees/Romo, there’s not really that big of a gap between Murray and Ingram to say one improves the line over the other.   Enough Preface, let’s get down to numbers.   Passing  Cowboys: 476 Attempts and 30 Sacks given up meaning the Cowboys offensive line gave up a sack every 15.87 attempts.   Saints: 659 Attempts and 30 Sacks given up meaning the Saints offensive line gave up a sack every 21.97 attempts.   The sack numbers show the Saints line was drastically better than the Cowboys, especially since defenses were game planning specifically to stop the pass where as defenses against the Cowboys were focusing on the run and not sending as many men at the QB.  But lets look at QB hits too.   Cowboys: 476 attempts and 53 QB Hits meaning the line gave up a QB hit every 8.98 attempts  Saints: 659 Attempts and 81 QB Hits meaning the line gave up a QB hit every 8.14 attempts.   QB Hits give the Cowboys a slight advantage, but lets look at it even further. If I add sacks and QB hits together and divide it by pass attempts, you really see what a pass blocking line really is giving up.  Cowboys: 476 attempts and 83 costly mistakes, meaning the Cowboys line made a mistake in pass blocking 1 and every 5.73 attempts.  Saints: 659 Attempts and 111 costly mistakes, meaning the Saints line made a mistake in pass blocking every 5.94 attempts.   In conclusion, looking at the numbers and averages, the Saints line pass blocked as good or better than the Cowboys.  Run Blocking  Not going to argue that the Cowboys had a better run blocking line than the Saints, but by how much? Let’s look at the data.  Cowboys: 508 attempts, 2,354 yards, 4.63 yards per attempt  Saints: 406 attempts, 1,818 yards, 4.48 yards per attempt.  That’s a whopping .2 yards per carry better meaning if both team rush the ball 40 times a game at those averages, the Cowboys would outgain the Saints by 6 yards.   But lets look at scoring since being effective at running the ball into the endzone is as important is gaining yards. Attempts aren’t really necessary   Cowboys: 16 Rushing TDs  Saints: 16 Rushing TDs  So that’s a push. Let’s break it down even further to add negative plays since a negative yard play is really the lines faults.  Cowboys: 508 attempts, 48 negative plays meaning the line gave up a negative run every 10.58 attempts.  Saints: 406 attempts, 34 negative plays meaning the line gave up a negative run every 11.94 attempts.  So the Saints line is actually better at not giving up bad plays in the run game.   In conclusion, like the Saints passing the ball, the Cowboys ran the ball so much that defenses were game planing for it. Take it as you will, but there's just not really that much of a difference in performance to justify saying the Cowboys were dominant over the Saints.   Overall  By my count in 2014, the Saints line were:  Sacks: 6.1 attempts better  QB Hits: .84 attempts worse  Negative Pass Plays: .21 attempts better  Rushing Average: .2 yards per carry worse  TDs: Push  Negative Run Plays: 1.36 attempts better."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,6,Thu Jul 16 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Here's some context:  In 2011, the Saints allowed the fewest QB hits in the league. In 2012, they allowed the third-fewest. In 2013, that ranking fell to 12, and in 2014 it fell further to 16."
Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing that the Saints' line didn't need to be improved. I'm just saying statistically it isn't as bad as people make it out to be (very comparable to the Cowboys' ""great"" line). The Saints line is solidly in the Top 10 in the NFL, and people act like it's a bottom 5 line."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:12 2015 UTC,"If you use your QB hits stat, our line fell from a consistent top 3 ranking between 2009 and 2012 to middle of the pack in 2013 and 2014.   That difference is critical for us, because of the sort of player Brees is."
Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,0,Thu Jul 16 18:13:52 2015 UTC,"There's also variables to play that doesn't involve the line like considering what Brees did in 2009 to 2012 when he saw/felt pressure coming, and what available options he had in 20013 and 2014.  IMO the increase in hits had to do with a lack of a 3rd down back who could chip block a pass rusher and have elite speed to get out in the flat and catch a pass. From 2009 to 2012, we had Reggie Bush who was a master at this, and Sproles who was also great. In 2013, Sproles showed obvious decline in this area going from 104 targets in 13 games in 2012 to 89 targets in 15 games in 2013. Last season in Philly Sproles definitely showed he was slowing down in the run and pass game after the first 4 or 5 games of the season. His punt return skills were shit hot though.   This year Payton made it a priority to get that pass catcher/chip blocker. I don't think it was a coincidence."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of it too. But there's only so many ways to slice the facts. In 2013 and 2014, Brees faced more pressure than in any other years of his Saints career. They are the only two seasons in New Orleans his sack percentage increased to above four percent, and they are the two seasons that rank worst in terms of QB hits.  FWIW, the Saints also ranked close to the middle of the pack in QB hits allowed in 2010, the year Brees had 22 interceptions."
Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,0,Thu Jul 16 18:30:50 2015 UTC,"But you also have to consider the increase in pass attempts from 2009 and 2014. Yes the line gave up few QB hits in 2009 over 2014, but Brees attempted 145 more passes so there was a lot more opportunity for a QB hit.   I only have team data from 2009 on, so bare with me. This should show you trends in your argument.   Year    Attempts    Sacks   %   Hits    %   Total   %   Int %  2009:   544     20  27.2%   52  10.5%   72  7.6%    12  45.3%  2010:   661     26  25.4%   68  9.7%     94 7.0%    22  30.0%  2011:   662     24  27.6%   51  13.0%   75  8.8%    14  47.2%  2012:   671     26  25.8%   59  11.4%   85  7.9%    19  35.3%  2013:   651     37  17.6%   75  8.7%    112 5.8%    12  54.3%  2014:   659     30  22.0%   81  8.1%    111 5.9%    17  38.8%  Sorry, setting up tables are just too difficult for me.   I think we can conclude that 2013 and 2014 were our worst line years, but it’s odd that 2013 was the best year he had when considered INT per Attempt."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"2009, like 2006, is an aberration in terms of attempts though. The attempts were the usual 650+ in 2011 and 2012 and we still ranked in the top three in fewest hits allowed.  Agree that the 2013 pick things was odd (and welcome), but we had plenty of people using their ""eyeball test"" even then to ""prove"" Brees was in decline when really he was suffering from increased pressure, particularly in those games Charles Brown totally melted down."

Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:43 2015 UTC,No argument on that end. Better line = Better Brees
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,3,Thu Jul 16 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"It's all well and good to just look at sacks, but sacks out of context arent a good stat. Brees doesn't like to take sacks, and he therefore gets rid of the ball a lot more often than he takes a sack. We saw this a lot last year, and it led to increased interceptions and incompletions. A lot of sacks themselves are on the quarterback and how he deals with it, and Brees would rather get rid of the ball any way possible than take a sack. It's fine to say he was sacked less on a per drop back basis, but that doesn't take into a blunt his total pressures or how often he was disrupted"
Saints,3diev2,Bouzal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't just take them out of context. I showed sacks, qb hits and a combination of QB hits and sacks.   And yes, I realize how good Brees is at releasing the ball quickly, but you're underestimating how good Romo is at that too."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,3,Thu Jul 16 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% that our poor performance was almost all on our defense. Our offense put up great numbers on the board, but we couldn't stop other teams from putting a few more points on top."
Saints,3diev2,mankstar,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:00 2015 UTC,Brees had twice as many interceptions also. Romo: 9. Brees: 17. Not that line is necessarily the cause of that but poor blocking leads to more mistakes in the decision making too. I'd like to see that factored in.
Saints,3diev2,olbleedyeyes,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:34 2015 UTC,"You can't just compare Romo's 9 INTs and Brees 17. Brees attempts a lot more passes we gave defenses a lot more opportunities and a lot more film to improve chances of INTs.   Let's look at averages. Romo threw an interception every 48.3 attempts. Brees threw an interception every 38.8 attempts.   Looking at raw data you can say that Brees threw almost twice as many interceptions, but in reality there's only a 10% difference at the rates in which Brees and Romo throws interceptions.   For example, we both took test. I got 10 answers wrong and you only got 5 answers wrong. So technically I got twice as many wrong answers as you. But my test was out of 20 questions and your test was out of 10 questions, so we both got 50% of the questions wrong."

Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"Not that I doubt anything you said, but where would one find all these stats?  Also it would be interesting to see QB hurries. Feel like drew was hurried almost every single time he stepped back last year. He doesn't like to get hit so he'd rather throw it away to avoid the hit than hang in the pocket and risk getting hurt. And I know you can take into account pass accuracy to account for hurries, but that doesn't really do the comparison justice."
Saints,3diev2,DJgoat,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"The Saints allowed the most QB hurries and the third most total pressures, according to PFF"
Saints,3diev2,Bouzal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"according to PFF   There's your problem. QB hurries and pressure is complete judgement and aren't official stats. Just because PFF gives a stat doesn't mean that stat is accurate. NFL.com has official stats, not PFF."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of PFF grades, but their stats are much more objective. It's not hard to tell when a QB gets hurried, and it's a very legitimate thing that disrupts a QB. NFL doesn't have these stats, all they have is sacks, so I'm going off them. I'm not using the grades cause they by and large suck, but to completely discount a website that's entire job is to analyze NFL players is ignorant. Not everything can be learned from raw stats, ESPECIALLY in the case of the O-Line where there is literally only 1 official stat   Edit: Rather, 2 official stats, sacks and hits"
Saints,3diev2,Bouzal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:10:44 2015 UTC,"Is there another website that tracks pressures and hurries? If there is, shouldn't those numbers be the same?   The reason why the NFL doesn't track hurries and pressures is because they are too subjective. It's subjective to determine what is a hurry and what was close to being a hurry. Also it's hard to calculate hurries on designed plays that allow defenders to go unblocked, which is the case on screens and on hot routes (One of Brees' signature hot routes is having the slot run a short slant over the middle which requires the edge rusher to go free to open the passing lane... which 100% a time a hurry)"

Saints,3diev2,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by some of your reasoning.  You say that we must dismiss PFF's ""hurries"" statistic because it is too subjective as to what a ""hurry"" actually is. And that makes sense, because of the reasons you have listed.  But just because it is a difficult statistic to measure, that doesn't mean it doesn't play a huge role in the overall performance of the line.  The consistently disappointing moments of our line recently have been when we see Brees forced to throw int/inc/no-gain checkdown passes because of an imminent rushing threat. Sacks and hits are a solid stat to quantify and interpret, but the difficult-to-quantify statistic of pressures/hurries is too integral in evaluating the line for us to dismiss.  Maybe you've already addressed this though, as I haven't thoroughly read everything in this thread yet."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying hurries aren't important, I'm saying the numbers aren't accurate so I don't use them."
Saints,3diev2,Hotdog_Skin,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"But I feel like an analysis of an o-line is incomplete without taking them into account.   Or at the very least, you can't make an overall conclusion without taking them into account. You can say ""when taking into account sacks and hits only, our line is just as good as any other."" But that's not the same as saying ""our line OVERALL is just as good as any other.""   I think that's why you're getting pushback from people. The sacks and hits don't tell the whole story of our line last year, so when you make a conclusion based on incomplete data, it seems innacurate."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's complete analysis, but it's the best I got without doing some serious research or finding another post I created a few months back that I crutched numbers on the impact of the hurries (i.e. accuracy and y/a as well as other QB stats). There's no accurate number for QB hurries, and if there were it would still be questionable with how the QB position is played since there are so many designed plays that leave pass rushers free to create passing lanes and space (i.e. screens and hot routes to the slot receiver.)  I'd say if there was a decent list for hurries that Brees would be at the top almost every year since he relies so heavily on screen passes and manufactured passing lanes. There's just too many variables that the stat collector has to consider when compiling that statistic -- many of which they wouldn't be privy to without knowing the playbook and audibles called at the line of scrimmage.   The Saints had over 6,500 yards from scrimmage last season, which I believe is Top 10 all-time, and Brees had what could have been an MVP year if you cut his interceptions in half and the Saints made the playoffs (none of which I blame the offensive line for). We also had our best year running the ball (due to a new blocking scheme) since Deuce retired. In the history of football no team has ever accomplished these things behind a bad line. Barry Sanders Lions lines may have had these stats in one aspect, but not both.  Not I can't 100% prove that the Saints line was not a major weakness last season, but I can present you to the fact that the Saints had the No. 1 TO, No. 1 PO, Top 10 RO, had comparable QB hits, Sacks Allowed and negative run plays given up to the supposedly best offensive line in the NFL, and you can draw your own conclusions.   In fact, the only thing people present as an argument against the 2014 line being good is the Eyeball test and PFF statistic that has questionable validity on how it was calculated.   I don't understand how the burden of proof is on me after I gave a list of hard data and side-by-side comparison where the other side is giving nothing but stats based on personal judgement.   I don't understand how people side with personal judgement over factual data. I also don't understand how QB hurries alone trumps the 9 or 10 categories I've presented. Your argument is that my categories are incomplete, but QB hurries alone is not?   But all that being said, I'm not arguing that improving the offensive line wasn't a high priority. Goodwin was old and a train wreck, we only had one starter on the line still in his 20s and the depth that Harper provided at tackles was the equivalent of a traffic cone, and our backup center was completely out of position. There's no doubt in my mind that we have a better line in 2015 than we did in 2014 and thus we have a potential to be a better offense in 2015. But you can improve on a unit without the original unit being terrible."
Saints,3diev2,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how the burden of proof is on me after I gave a list of hard data and side-by-side comparison where the other side is giving nothing but stats based on personal judgement.   I think the burden of proof is on you only because you made the assertion that our line is as good as Dallas'.  If you made the assertion ""In regards to these specific stats, our line is as good.."" then I'd say you have nothing left to prove because the specific stats you stated proves your statement. But you made an assertion about the overall performance and that seems like a leap since you're only using two specific stats that don't tell the whole story.(in regards to passpro)   I don't understand how people side with personal judgement over factual data. I also don't understand how QB hurries alone trumps the 9 or 10 categories I've presented. Your argument is that my categories are incomplete, but QB hurries alone is not?   Of course QB hurries alone is an incomplete stat. But I'm also not making the assertion that our o-line is terrible based solely on hurries, ignoring other stats.(Or that is even terrible at all)  I think the major disconnect is that most people think about the quality of our line as just pass protection. But the resurgence of our run game has played a HUGE part in the gradual improvement of our line overall. So when people hear that our o-line is actually pretty good, people think ""no way, I saw brees getting pressured constantly.""   Ultimately, I think that between passpro and runblocking, our o-line is pretty good and maybe a top-10 like you said. But that's because of the run game. If we're talking pass protection, i'd say that the pressure on Brees has had a much bigger effect on our pass game than the sacks/hits categories. But like you said, pressure is such a nebulous concept that it's immeasurable. But it doesn't change the fact that without those pressures, God only knows what Brees could accomplish.  I dunno man, this is all sounding much more complicated than I intended. I guess I'm just trying to say it sounds like your dismissing the effect of pressures simply because it's hard to measure, and that seems like an incomplete analysis leading to an inaccurate assertion that our o-line is just as good as any other. But I do agree it's not nearly as bad as most make it out to sound, and I won't even disagree that our line is top-ten when you emphasize that the run game is a major part of evaluating a line.   It just seems like Brees hasn't been able to reach his potential due to the interior pressure that is specifically his Kryptonite."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"It's not that I'm dismissing it. There's just not enough accurate information for me to use. To me there is just lack of proof that Brees was pressured more in 2014 than in years past, but it also looked like he was getting hit and sacked at an alarming rate too, but the official stats don't reflect that.   All I know is fans tend to focus on the negative and look to find anything to blame when you start the season with legitimate Super Bowl aspirations and start the season with losses against the Falcons and Browns and then go on to lose 5 straight home games to close out the season.   The fact is we had a pretty great offense despite all those losses and that's hard to do with a terrible offensive line. We didn't lose 9 games because the line couldn't block for Brees. We lost 9 games because our defense sucked balls.  Edit: If we were 9-7 instead of 7-9 and made the playoffs, which could easily have been accomplished if we had a better corner opposite Lewis, the fan's attitude towards the line and all these line rankings would improve despite nothing changing on offense."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:20:29 2015 UTC,Oh and the reason I don't like PFF line grades and premium stats is because they generally favor teams with good records as opposed to teams with bad records even if the teams have bad records because of having bad defenses despite top rated offenses.   There's obvious winners bias (as well as media bias with individual legacy players) with PFF that some times goes against every other statistic which logically means an anomaly created by personal judgement.
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,0,Fri Jul 17 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"Actually the Saints line last season was much, much better than as good if not better Dallas'. Stop believing the media hype and fake PFF ratings. The only reason most people think Dallas' line is so great is that we have been feed that it is great. The numbers just don't support it.   Edit: I couldn't support my original statement so I'm correcting it to what my data shows. It was more of a hypothesis than a declarative statement anyway."

IMO, either they are both bad, both great or both average. If you can't call the Saints line great, you shouldn't call the Cowboys line great.  I'm not saying the Cowboys line is bad, I'm just saying the media is saying the Cowboys line is much better than they actually are and the media is saying the Saints line is much worse than they actually are."

Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,2,Thu Jul 16 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"The Saints' interior line was a major weakness, especially in pass protection. Here's a great read that explains it better than I can, and in more detail:  http://alendumonjic.com/2015/03/27/the-friday-profile-qb-drew-brees-saints-offense/   There were a myriad of issues that had caused him to second guess his decisions and hesitate to throw the ball, which affected his footwork and the delivery of the football.  Brees didn’t trust his interior offensive line to protect him. They allowed pressures up the middle that forced him to slide his feet and reset them. As the season went on, he hesitated more and stepped back and outside of the pocket even when the pressure wasn’t completely there.  On one play during the season finale against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Brees flushed from the pocket when slight pressure pushed the pocket back. He could have stepped to the side and kept his eyes downfield and rotated his hips. Instead, he quit on the offensive line altogether and attempted an all-arm throw that flew over his receiver’s head."

Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,0,Thu Jul 16 18:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm calling our line Top 10 still. It's not our usual standard of Top 5, but I never claimed it to be. I'm just claiming that it's not as bad as the media points out and if you consider the Cowboys line great like the OP did, then the Saints also had a great line. Myself, I think both were good lines, but not great lines."
Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:13:41 2015 UTC,I'll even agree with that but unless we are truly great in pass protection in the interior we're going to see the less efficient Brees with too many turnovers.  That's the reason we'll be playing with two new starters in our interior line.
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,0,Thu Jul 16 18:17:38 2015 UTC,"Speaking to the choir here. there was definite room for improvement with Goodwin/Lelito being terrible and Grubbs and Evans showing their age. Ungar is an obvious lock at center, but I got a feeling we'll see more of a shake up than just Center and Guard on the line this offseason. I'm still not convinced that Lelito will be the Week 1 starter over Peat/Armstead/Strief."
Saints,3diev2,raptorbpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"I think there's a chance Lelito is decent. He played pretty well as a starter against Green Bay and Carolina, and he's a natural guard who will hopefully be playing between a great center and solid tackle. Goodwin was awful (and constantly hurt), and Grubbs was pretty bad too.  All starts with Unger, though."
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,0,Thu Jul 16 18:33:28 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'm not discrediting Lelito, but from what I've seen out of him so far that there are plenty of people that could be as good if not better than him. He could be the best, but I think Payton will put the best 5 linemen out there period whether it's 3 tackles, Evans and Unger or two tackles, Evans, Lelito and Unger."

I can't count the number of times I saw Romo drop back and have 5 or 6 seconds of a perfectly clean pocket to throw from. I can't remember that happening a single time with Brees
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:46:05 2015 UTC,"The eye test is a horrible way to judge anything and leads to statements like "" I can't count the number of times I saw Romo drop back and have 5 or 6 seconds of a perfectly clean pocket to throw from. I can't remember that happening a single time with Brees""  I offered you proof based on nfl.com statistics, and you ignore it. The proof that you gave me is based on your memory of last season. There is no source or proof to your statement. It's no different than me saying the Saints line was just as good as the Cowboys and stopping there. No way would you let me fly with just a generalize opinionated statement."
Saints,3diev2,Bouzal,2,Thu Jul 16 18:01:56 2015 UTC,"But I don't consider your stats proof because they don't tell a full story. I just replied to your above post, with several other stats you left out. The saints line surrendered the most hurries in the league and the third most total pressures, whereas the cowboys line was fifth and second best in those respective categories. IMO this is a much more telling stat, because it takes into account how many times Brees was pressured vs just sacks. Comparing rate stats is fine to an extent, but rate stats are not the end all-be all because as volume goes up, rate inevitably goes down. Romo might have been sacked less, but Brees was pressured considerably more which led to more mistakes on his part"
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"Why are official stats no good enough, but someone's judgement and opinion is?   Hurries and Pressures are not a real stats and thus those numbers are meaningless. The NFL isn't tracking those stats. Are those hurries taking into account designed hurries like screens and hot routes? What's the cut off between what is and isn't a hurry?  So PFF gave a stat that shows how many hurries our line is giving up. Is there any other site that backs up those stats?"
Saints,3diev2,Bouzal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:11:47 2015 UTC,"So all you care about in football is exactly what the NFL tells you to? You don't watch players, you don't see advanced stats, you just take everything the raw stats say as gospel truth about who's better than who? I love stats as much as the next person, but even you have to agree that using a measles 2 stats to justify which line is better than another, especially stats like Sacks that only happen on a tiny percentage of drop backs, is cutting a lot of corners. Just because the NFL doesn't track it doesn't mean that it isn't a big part of what happens on the field"
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Jul 16 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"And I'm not saying they are the end all be all stats, but you are being completely dismissive to hard official data in favor of people's opinions and stats that aren't official and aren't proven to be accurate."

Saints,3diev2,olbleedyeyes,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:34 2015 UTC,I don't think stats always tell a story either. Statistically Pierre Thomas wasn't that great of a back. But we all know better of what he can do. Plus you can tell whether an o line is handling the d line and vis a vis.
Saints,3diev2,Saints2Death,0,Thu Jul 16 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"No but stats are facts and ""eyeball tests"" are opinions. Yes, facts don't tell the whole story, but the ""eyeball test"" don't tell anything other than an opinion based on personal judgement.   I much rather build an argument on facts than opinions or judgement.   Edit: If someone tells you the Saints line is bad, you'll focus on all the bad things to prove the point. If someone tells you the Saints line is good, you'll watch the game focusing on all the good things they do to prove the point.   Example: We were told the Cowboys line was great, so people tend to focus on all the things the Cowboy's line does well and ignore a relatively terrible sack rate. We were told Saints line was awful, so we focus on all the things they did wrong instead of what they did right."

Saints,3diev2,sfzen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:59:32 2015 UTC,"Our line won't be as good as Dallas. They've got the consensus best OL in the league. Ours is good, but I'm not sure if I'd call it top 5. Armstead is good, but still not in his prime yet. Lelito is the favorite for the LG spot, and, as much as I like the guy, I'll call him average maybe, with plenty of bias; I think he's a fantastic backup, mediocre starter. Unger is an Pro Bowl center if he stays healthy. Evans is an average starting RG, and I'll freely admit that his recent Pro Bowls have been based on name alone. Strief is a solid starting RT, and Peat is a 1st round rookie backup at both OT spots who might win the RT job, so we'll assume he's a good one.  Compared to last year, I think we're much improved. I'll take (including a vital backup) Armstead-Lelito-Unger-Evans-Strief-Peat over Armstead-Grubbs-Lelito/Goodwin-Evans-Strief-Harris every day.  We need to find a replacement for Evans in the next couple of years, and probably one for Lelito, but Armstead looks like our franchise LT, Peat should take over the RT spot when Strief leaves/retires, and Unger has a lot of good football left in him if he can stay healthy. Hopefully Lelito can emerge as a solid starting OG, so we'll only have Evans to worry about."

Then when the weather clears up in the fourth quarter, Brees marches down the field twice and gets a 2  point conversion.  We were clearly wrecking them, when time ran out.

I still believe he can be in those talks of being one of the best Safeties in the league especially if he can bounce back from being injured last year. He's a incredible talent with a great nose for the ball.  Let's just hope last year was just a sophomore slump for Vaccaro.
Saints,3dfy5m,ohhgod,3,Thu Jul 16 13:53:22 2015 UTC,Vaccaro played through a few calf injuries which might have had something to do with it.  Also he was playing more of a traditional strong safety role instead of what he played last year as a slot/linebacker kinda safety( I don't know what it's called).  So if they use him how they did his rookie season he should improve.

Saints,3dcfmf,flordeliest,3,Wed Jul 15 05:06:45 2015 UTC,And he's done pretty much nothing to be honest. He has a chance to break out in a big way with Kenny Stills no longer in the picture. It's great news for Toon.
Saints,3dcfmf,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:14 2015 UTC,Um no he has had 217 yards over the course of the last six games of the season. He was the reason we beat the Steelers on the road when we didn't have Graham or Cooks.
Saints,3dcfmf,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"I just can't really agree that Nick Toon has ""broken out"" yet with an average of 36 yards per game over just six games.

Saints,3dcfmf,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:04:06 2015 UTC,That's not starter production.
Saints,3dcfmf,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:04:20 2015 UTC,That may be because he wasn't a starter.
Saints,3dcfmf,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so you can't say he broke out. To ""break out"" you have to put up good numbers for a starter."
Saints,3dcfmf,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:13:56 2015 UTC,But he did when injuries piled up and he proved he can be a reliable receiving threat.

Saints,3dcfmf,Wolverigne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"He was consistently decent.   He didn't see the field enough to make this a valid statement, but he has shown he can run ever route on the tree.  Slants: 2 targets, 2 receptions, 16 yards  Out routes: 7 targets, 5 receptions, 63 yards  In routes: 3 targets, 2 receptions, 37 yards  Comebacks: 3 targets, 2 receptions, 27 yards  Hitches: 5 targets, 4 receptions, 42 yards  Go routes: 2 targets, 1 reception, 24 yards  Crossing routes: 1 target, 1 reception, 6 yards  And that he can be counted on to make playes when we need him too.  To say he hasn't broken out purely off of volume of stats is completely  wrong."
Saints,3dcfmf,Wolverigne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:56:55 2015 UTC,"To say that he broke out based off of limited action is completely wrong. For many other positions (offensive line and most on defense) you don't need stats to break out because stats tell little about how you impacted the game. The skill positions however, stats tell you a lot about what happens. Of course there is the more in depth stuff, like what coverages or corners has he beaten, but if a receiver has not gotten a lot of yards, can you really say they broke out? He has had limited production due to limited action. I'm saying decent because he hasn't blown up the place when on the field, but he also hasn't been bad. I'm not saying consistently as in over the course of a season, I'm saying consistently as in he made a decent impact in each game but nothing special, outside of his one touchdown.  ""To say he hasn't broken out purely off of volume of stats is completely wrong."" You're not going to say someone broke out if they got 400 to 500 yards over the course of a season, but was only playing a part-time or limited role. Breaking out applies to starters because we're not talking about someone breaking out as a solid backup or a potential starter. Someone who broke out is someone who had a good year in which they looked like a good starter or better."
Saints,3dapm1,Jesus_Oregon,3,Tue Jul 14 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a sleeper tight end this season. He's consistent, big, good hands and blocks. He's not a wr like graham, but he'll be a nice compliment to Spiller and Cooks catching the ball."
Saints,3dapm1,Zorg_Industries,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"The way he scored on a couple of those touchdowns makes me super excited. He isn't afraid of contact at all and he hustles towards the end zone whenever he is close. He's more of s traditional TE, and actually benefits the offense more because he can block.   He will never put up Jimmy Graham numbers,  but 750 yds and 6 or 7 touchdowns will be perfect for this offense."
Saints,3dapm1,nola_mike,3,Tue Jul 14 23:56:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it looks like he's running good routes and has great hands, but all I see is Drew Brees droppin' dimes to a TE who's wide open on a lot of these plays."

Doubly so considering their situations, one playing with Drew Brees, the other playing with a QB who targeted his TE more than any other QB in the nation. Maybe look at some more low key guys who could surprise both fans and the team. Again, I mean this as constructive criticism, so please don't take it the wrong way!  That aside, I like your picks for the Falcons and Panthers. Think Brooks Reed is a very underrated signing and honestly wish we could have gotten him."
Saints,3d9ekv,Terrenon0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice, it's much appreciated. I think Josh Hill is a fair sleeper considering he's always been in Jimmy's shadows, but I agree that there are deeper sleepers you could have (for our AFC West one we had Cody Latimer, Gabe Jackson, Jahleel Addae and Albert Wilson, and our AFC North one currently in progress is getting really, really deep down haha).  ASJ is trickier - he's a big name, but have people forgotten about him/written him off after his disappointing rookie year? I think the fact that so many rookie TEs disappointed last year actually works against calling him a sleeper, because it's as if he's the best of a bad bunch, when he was just plain bad."
Saints,3d9ekv,Terrenon0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"I just feel like you can't sleep on any starting skill player on the same team as Drew Brees, you know? Sure, Hill is no Graham, but Brees can make just about anyone look good (Hello, David Patten!). It's more Brees that affects his sleeper status than anything, in my opinion. It would be interesting to see how he plays with McCown or Griffin under center, but unless Drew gets hurt (God forbid) we likely wont see that any time soon. At least against the defenders that matter.    As for ASJ-- he had a lot working against him last year; injuries, poor conditioning and a joke of a QB situation. This year he's healthy, in shape and playing with the #1 overall pick. I feel like everyone expects him to be better this year that just kinda makes it so he can't be a sleeper pick, but who knows? Maybe you're right and a lot of people are writing him off. I know I sure as hell won't come fantasy football time!"
Saints,3d9ekv,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hill and ASJ are both being hyped up, so they aren't sleepers."

Do you guys buy into the Josh Hill hype as much as the media seems to be doing? If not, who would you have chosen as a potential sleeper instead? I suggested Stanley Jean-Baptiste."
Saints,3d9ekv,djmcintyre,5,Tue Jul 14 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"I really don't buy into the Josh Hill hype at all. I think Watson is the best TE we have on the roster, and I honestly don't see where all the Hill hype is coming from.  For sleeper, I'd put forth Dalvin Breaux. Saints fans that have kept up with off season moves will know who he is, but I'd guess the average fan won't have heard about him. If what is being said about him in training camp actually holds true, we could be shaping up to have one hell of a nasty secondary. Keenan Lewis, Brandon Browner, Jairus Byrd, Kenny Vaccaro, and Dalvin in the slot."
Saints,3d9ekv,Megawatts19,3,Tue Jul 14 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"It's not like he played poorly when he was in last year, he caught 14 of 20 passes for 175 yards and 5 TD's  Whereas Watson caught 20 of 31 for 136 yards and 2 TD's"
Saints,3d9ekv,flordeliest,2,Tue Jul 14 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, I haven't heard of him. What makes you think he could be a good slot CB this year?"
Saints,3d9ekv,liftbrah21,3,Tue Jul 14 15:36:02 2015 UTC,"Just the word coming out of camp. His story is that he was a highly touted recruit out of high school from the Greater New Orleans area. Then he took a devastating hit that (and I'm foggy on the details of the injury) really messed his back and neck up. He was near death after the hit and was told he would never play again. He didn't accept that, fought back, and eventually found his way into the CFL. He was then signed by us this off season. In his past he was highly athletic and was a top CB prospect before his injury. Now, he's getting a crack at the NFL. He's been taking first team reps in camp also. So, here's to hoping..."
Saints,3d9ekv,Megawatts19,2,Tue Jul 14 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't have a clue. I'm now really rooting for him to do well this year. Thanks for the info!"
Saints,3d9ekv,sophandros,0,Tue Jul 14 15:45:02 2015 UTC,"But Specifically why do you see him in the slot?  He has like no experience there. Its more likely PJ or Swann get the slot and Breaux is the third outside CB, only behind Browner and Lewis."
Saints,3d9ekv,maddlabber829,6,Tue Jul 14 22:14:00 2015 UTC,"Watson is the best TE we have on the roster   Watson was God awful last year. He dropped everything thrown to him and showed negative body language pretty much all season. Hill caught 5 TDs on limited snaps and displayed great athleticism and body control on contested catches. Maybe...you just didn't fully pay attention the past two seasons. Hill made a few great catches in 2013 as well. There's plenty of evidence to say he will be a solid starting TE. Not necessarily stand out, or All-Pro/Pro Bowl, but he will contribute just fine. He's done it when called upon before, with Cooks healthy and the threat of Spiller and Ingram, Hill will get his.   Dalvin Breaux   It's Delvin   and Dalvin in the slot.   Again, Delvin   Saints fans that have kept up with off season moves will know who he is, but I'd guess the average fan won't have heard about him.   We all know who he is. He had, IIRC, 19 teams trying to sign him."
Saints,3d9ekv,mankstar,6,Tue Jul 14 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"I get he'll contribute, but people are talking him up like he's going to be every bit as good as Graham, which isn't going to happen.  Shit, my bad for misspelling his name. But again, all the fans that frequent this sub will know who he is, but as far as the majority of the fan base, they probably don't know much about him."
Saints,3d9ekv,Megawatts19,6,Tue Jul 14 16:01:52 2015 UTC,"If he's 50% as good as Graham, then he's performing at Shockey's level. That's not too bad, either."

That said, while I do think Gregg & Saints used language and had a general fevor that sounds really really bad, I doubt any cash was actually paid, nor do I think it's even possible for anyone to actually do it.

When the other team has a weakness, you go after it with your defense. When teams know the other QB has a weak knee, they tell their players to go low when they can. It's not a secret and plenty of NFL players have said as much when asked about bountygate. Suggs mentioned a ""bounty"" on Rashard Mendenhall before the same game where Ray Lewis injured him and then pointed at him as he was helped off the field. This has been part of the sport for a long time and the reason Goodell struck so hard on us was because they were implementing new measures for player safety and wanted to be sure no one would ever do it again. Gregg Williams' speech was the closest thing they could get to a ""smoking gun"" and Williams would not have been allowed to coach again if they hadn't coerced him into a ""confession"". It's entirely unfair that Payton lost a year in the most successful era of our franchise when there's not even solid proof of what happened or didn't."
Saints,3d3h8l,dean815,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:16 2015 UTC,"But even if you say go low, in no way does a guy going for a tackle think ""Im'a hit him low and get that bounty money"" Unless you are out practicing telling guys to dive at knees, there's no muscle memory to get a guy to remember what joint to hit.  I think Payton lost a year cause league privately told them to cut it out, and year later he did not. When league tells you to do a thing, you do that thing. That said I think injury rhetoric is just that. I have personally screamed during a game to ""take out his knee"" but never wanted anyone to actually do that. Shit remember Micheal Vick? He was all the Falcons had, of course I wished ill will upon him. But I never want anyone to get hurt."

It was used to mark slaves but fundamentally it was a symbol of France.   The Confederate flags was a symbol of the Confederacy.   France wasn't fundamentally started to oppress people.   The Confederacy was started because they thought the federal government was trampling over their states rights to keep slaves. The Confederate flag and what it stands for are fundamentally for the oppression of a whole gaggle of people.   Nobody is saying you shouldn't be able to own a Confederate flag, and this whole whitewashing stuff of taking it off the General Lee and such is ridiculous. However, maybe that symbol shouldn't be flown by a government that's supposed to represent everyone.   The swastika is a symbol used in Hinduism, and sure enough you see it often in India. However, it's also the symbol of the oppression of Jews and many others by the Nazis. You don't see any governments flying flags with swastikas on them here in the U.S., though it shouldn't be illegal for private citizens to own them.

Lots  and lots of different things have been used to mark slaves from stars(Cowboys) to horseshoes(Colts) to hearts and Greek letters.  Don't humor the argument that the Flour De lis is even remotely racist.   Be out raged that the author willfully omitted the entirety of the Code Noir and how it pertains to slavery in Louisiana under French rule vs slavery in the antebellum southern era to fit his agenda.    Louisiana's slave trade was governed by the French Code Noir, and later by its Spanish equivalent the Código Negro, [6] As written, the Code Noir gave unparalleled rights to slaves, including the right to marry. Although it authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture them or to separate married couples (or to separate young children from their mothers). It also required the owners to instruct slaves in the Catholic faith, implying that Africans were human beings endowed with a soul, an idea that had not been acknowledged until then...  The Code Noir also forbade interracial marriages, but interracial relationships were formed in New Orleans society. The mulattoes became an intermediate social caste between the whites and the blacks, while in the English colonies the mulattoes and blacks were considered equal and discriminated against equally.   This is something I am almost certain professor Terence Fitzmorris mentioned and the author intentionally left out.

Firstly, I don't watch daytime news cause yeah its pretty much BS, however not for the reason you think. All the news network want is profits, so all they do is fear-monger and play at racial tensions etc, etc. No, its not a PC conspiracy, you are an idiot to think that, its purely for ratings and revenue. All networks have done it and yes IMO that does make them assholes for it and what its done to America, race relations especially.  Secondly being PC falls into the same line as being polite, no one can make you do anything but don't be surprised when you say certain things at work and are fired because of it, like in Sterling's and Stephen A's case. I don't know what else to tell you about it. Business only care about profit and don't tolerate being seen like that endorse certain political views. It has nothing to do with freedom of speech and there is nothing wrong with being PC.  Thirdly, the government has no right to endorse, protect, or produce materials that hold some political or ideological significance, as the Gov't has no rights only powers. It simply can't hold political or ideological preferences or even imply that it does. The confederate flag on the South Carolina Capitol grounds can be seen at the government endorsing a political stance and was farce to begin. This is also the same case for the Trademark offices ruled to not uphold the name Redskins and the National Park Service that owns the land their stadium is built on. Along with Texas no longer issuing confederate flag license plates.  Form your own opinion, don't regurgitate whats been told too in an incoherent mess of differing issues and topics.

Yes, I know some who say they don't find it offensive. I also have known Native Americans who say they don't let it offend them so as not to give the term any power. None of them spoke for all Native Americans, and I imagine out-and-out asking someone if they find it offensive is more likely to evoke the answer they think you want to hear. I do believe that just about anyone will agree savage is a racial slur though. That's why SEOSU finally changed its mascot (albeit to the profoundly stupid Savage Storm).

HUGE difference from the meaning of the Fleur de Lis."
Saints,3cwsec,sophandros,4,Sat Jul 11 22:45:55 2015 UTC,I along with a lot of historians would argue there are many other reasons the civil war was started other than slavery. In fact I've heard major news sources claim it is one of the most largely debated historical events we have. So to say that with such certainty is clearly wrong.
Saints,3cwsec,depcrestwood,2,Sun Jul 12 01:42:37 2015 UTC,"To claim that rights to slavery wasn't part of the cause for the Civil War is simply denial.  It wasn't the only reason, but it was one of them.  And the fact that it was thrown in there as a reason to secede from the US, and then to use a battle flag designed by a man who declared the flag was meant to symbolize white supremacy, makes the flag a symbol of racism.  If the rednecks who insist on waving it around today want to try to redefine the flag, then fine.  Have at it.   But they have their work cut out for them.  Especially when you have a group like the Klan out there protesting it's removal from state grounds as loudly as anyone else.  And let's not forget the flag is also representative of a group of people who were trying to break the US.  How people can wave that flag and still claim to be patriots seems nothing less than hypocritical to me."

And I'm willing to bet it was the top reason on the minds of any slaves looking to be free, which I imagine was damn near all of them.  They could not have given less of a rat's ass about higher taxes.  But what they did see was that flag working so hard to keep them as slaves.   None of that changes the fact that it is the battle flag of traitors, and ultimately, the losers.  It does not have a place on public grounds, and the people's tax dollars should not go toward upholding a relic of a broken past.   Fly the flag on your own property all you want. Hell, paint your house up like the flag and have the General Lee out on your lawn for all the world to see. Embrace it as your heritage and more power to you.  But you can't expect the rest of the world to embrace it with you.   It's not our flag."
Saints,3cwsec,sophandros,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"I  along with a lot of historians would argue there are many other reasons the civil war was started other than slavery.    The primary reason was slavery. Period. Here are the Declaration of Causes from seceding states. All of them reference slavery, and they all express the belief in white supremacy.  http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/declarationofcauses.html   In fact I've heard major news sources claim it is one of the most largely debated historical events we have.   That's because there are a lot of Lost Causers out there who refuse to acknowledge facts. Kind of like the people who deny science on a daily basis. Just because we have those people out there doesn't change the facts of the matter.  But let's look at another source, Alexander Stevens, the Vice President of the CSA:   The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution — African slavery as it exists amongst us — the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ""storm came and the wind blew.""  Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery — subordination to the superior race — is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.]    https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech  If you read the Confederate Constitution, you'll find that the institution of slavery was codified therein. And for all the talk of ""states rights"", the CSA decided to ban member states from prohibiting slavery. So in other words, the Confederacy, for all its concern over states' rights, denied its member states the right to decide whether or not they would be a slaveholding state.  But let's get to the second part of my post, which you curiously declined to address.   that's what it meant in the 20th century, particularly during Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement   Do you deny that the primary use of the Confederate Battle Flag in the 20th century was to terrorize black Americans and later to protest integration both in our schools and communities? Have you completely ignored 20th century history?  Look, facts are facts. You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts.  Hat tip to /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov over at /r/badhistory, where much of the Civil War material for this post was drawn."
Saints,3cwsec,Jesus_Oregon,0,Sun Jul 12 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"There were enough free slaves fighting FOR the South for them to have an entire regiment.  They fought under the Confederate Battle Flag.  Many..I repeat...MANY freed negro slaves actually owned slaves. Not just their mother and sisters either, although they did own them as well.  Besides, the real reason the civil war was fought was the north getting over zealous in their taxation of southern river trading routes.

Saints,3crknb,Megawatts19,8,Fri Jul 10 16:11:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly think we have a solid 10+ wins if all goes well, and I also agree with /u/SteakWay. Rob is pretty much getting fired if the defense cannot do well this season. We NEED to see improvements."
Saints,3crknb,mcdeafy,2,Fri Jul 10 07:49:10 2015 UTC,I don't see it having an effect on Sean. I think Sean would need 5 or more of those in a row.
Saints,3crknb,quantumhed,3,Fri Jul 10 06:29:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly last year we should have been 9-7/10-6. I'm not one of those guys that preaches we were ""this close"" Because the NFL is a one score differential league. We easily could have been 10-6 and been division winners, with only one OT division game going a different way. A lot of that had to do with bad protection, bad luck, one dimensional backfield, horrible run defense, and horrible pass defense. Now we have better protection, pass defense, 2 dimensional backfield, and possibly a better run defense. The only thing I can clearly see that we will struggle with is our playmaker on offense, Ingram and & Spiller will shine. The rest is made up by good coaching. Coaching is what our season depends on this year, and if they fail, we fail. We don't have to be 13-3 or win the superbowl this year, we just need to make the playoffs. I think overall we are a better team with all the moves and if we end up 8-8 we have a long decade ahead."
Saints,3crknb,aimerj,3,Fri Jul 10 16:52:06 2015 UTC,I think they'd have to have a few very bad seasons to can Payton. New Orleans loves that man.
Saints,3crknb,dean815,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"At the very least, Rob Ryan is gone.  It really all depends, though. If it's injury-related, there's really no one to blame. If it's performance-related I'm not sure how much more nuking we could do from this past offseason."
Saints,3crknb,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:46:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on how it happens. If the defense keeps playing like it did last year, then Rob Ryan is going to be shown the door. If for some reason Brees can't throw for 4,000 yards this season (with exception if the run game becomes used way more) than he may be shown the door because now the supposed regression that everyone said was happening last year is rearing its ugly head. If it's almost all injury related, everyone may keep their jobs and they try again in 2016. I think regardless of what results in the Saints going 8-8, Sean Payton is going to end up keeping his job. It'll take a much bigger letdown than an 8-8 season next year for the Saints to consider letting him go at this time."
Saints,3crknb,overratedfood,2,Fri Jul 10 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you said, except for Brees being shown the door. They would need to go worse than 8-8 and it would have to be all Brees' fault. Even going 7-9 last season, he tied Big Ben with the most passing yards and helped make us the #1 offense of 2014. Even though the Saints overall had a bad season, Brees himself did not. He has two years left on his contract, and even if he played terrible those last two years it'll still be cheaper for him to be with us and training up his replacement than to cut him early and taking a chance."
Saints,3crknb,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:32:07 2015 UTC,Saints would have to go legit 3-13 with Brees throwing more INTs than TDs for him to be shown the door that fast.
Saints,3crknb,mallen12132,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"I think it depends how the young guys do on defense and how the offensive line develops. The focus of this offseason was defense, pass protection, and running game. If the defense isn't average or above average and we are 8-8 or below, I think Rob Ryan gets fired. If Brees struggles and we are 8-8, there could be the notion, he didn't have anyone to throw to and a pay cut would be asked of him, which I think he would take.... HOnestly it will depend on how the 8-8 season happens."
Saints,3crknb,rubicon99,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I really think a serious catastrophic event has to happen for the Saints to go 8-8, the schedule is to easy for that to happen."

Saints,3counu,ohhgod,32,Thu Jul 9 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"I might be the only Saints fan that feels Rob deserves to be here. Practically everyone wants his head. IIRC, his last year in Dallas as D-Coordinator, he had 11 different starting defenses in 16 games, on top of Dallas not having a lot of defensive talent in his time there aside from Ware.  He was great year 1 for us. Year 2, we extended the playbook, we moved Vaccaro to 2 deep man instead of his hybrid nickel/safety role. Byrd was hurt. Our CBs (White and Robinson) sucked, Keenan Lewis is a little overrated by Who Dat Nation, although, I love and appreciate his passion. Our 2nd round pick never touched the field.  Last season, everything was against RR. Now, it seems things have fallen in his favor and the playbook has been simplified again. He has more toys and reliable contributors coming into this season.  I was happy when we signed him. Im happy we didn't fire him. Rome wasn't built in a day."
Saints,3counu,makeplayz,12,Thu Jul 9 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"I'm glad he's here. I think that a knee jerk reaction of firing him this offseason would not only have been an insult to him, but it would have done us more harm than good as a franchise. I have absolutely no idea what to expect from either side of the ball this season, but I'm excited."
Saints,3counu,Megawatts19,5,Thu Jul 9 17:07:15 2015 UTC,I agree. It would've set us back. A more consistent offense should help the defense. Running the ball more should give them longer breaks between each defensive series and should help the field position battle as well as ball and clock control.
Saints,3counu,makeplayz,6,Thu Jul 9 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"While I totally agree that we overrate Lewis, it's hard to deny the fact that we flat out need him. Here's to everyone else doing their job this season."
Saints,3counu,GifelteFish,5,Thu Jul 9 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. He gives more effort than anybody else on defense other than when we had Lofton. He'll be healthier this year, so maybe his play will match our perception of him. I don't think he's bad. But Saints fan think he's a Top 5 when I'd barely have him crack Top 20, if he'd even crack the top 20. He's a very good CB when he has safety help over the top. A healthy Byrd should help him out."
Saints,3counu,makeplayz,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:07 2015 UTC,Totally agree. He was top 20 in 2013 but PFF had him in the like 70's for 2014. He is very good when everyone in the secondary keeps their assignments but he got burned when he tried to pick up everyone else's slack.
Saints,3counu,GifelteFish,2,Thu Jul 9 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"He wanted to much last season, he lost a couple of good players last offseason and didn't really get new ones (Byrd injuried). But he saw his success from 2013 and thought he could do more with his defense. And we all would have loved it if they have been able to play his complex scheme, but they couldn't.  Like /u/assasinine wrote a few days ago, Rob could already be with one foot out   Dennis Allen kind of makes this an interesting equation. Let's say the defense does turn it around, who's to say it's not because of Dennis? At any rate, they've probably already found Ryan's replacement if he does get canned.   I really hope they don't fire Rob if he is successful this season, he got a bunch of good players this offseason and with time provided he can make a really good defense with an complex scheme."

Saints,3cp8yg,liftbrah21,4,Sat Jul 11 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"As much of a Brees criticizer as I am, I believe he's still Top 10.  Mine would go:   Rodgers Luck Brady Brees Romo Wilson Big Ben P. Manning Rivers Flacco   (5-8 can be interchangeable because they're all at about the same tier.)  Matt Ryan doesn't deserve Top 10 IMO, because, besides hating his guts, he's A) a Falcon and B) was prematurely nicknamed ""Matty Ice"" his rookie season, yet, his playoff record is atrocious and he's done nothing to garner a nickname that implies he's cool under pressure and gets shit done. He's an underachiever in my eyes. If he takes ATL to a SB, my perception will change.   I don't think Eli deserves Top 10 until he can play a consistent 16 game season. He's erratic and bipolar with his play. He can make a Super Bowl caliber throw, or fumble 22 times in a season while throwing 20+ INTs. I don't get him.  Peyton Manning is no longer Elite. He's a notch below elite IMO."
Saints,3cp8yg,ovivios,7,Thu Jul 9 18:05:54 2015 UTC,"As much of a Brees criticizer as I am, I believe he's still Top 10.   i think a lot of us are probably too close to this, and last season was hard for me to watch as well, but you cannot deny his numbers. these are all NFL records   consecutive 4,500-yard passing seasons: 5  consecutive 4,000-yard passing seasons: 8 consecutive games with a TD pass: 54 consecutive games with 300 yards passing: 9 (hes done it twice) consecutive attempts in the playoffs without an interception: 226 (the longest current streak is Flacco at 137) consecutive games with at least 20 completions: 57 (the longest current streak is Ryan at 6) passing yards in a single season: 6,404 completions in a single season: 468 only 5 QBs have ever thrown for more than 5,000 yards in a season. Brees has done it 4 times. Peyton, Marino, Brady, and Stafford each did it once. highest single-season completion percentages in NFL history: 71.2 pct in 2011 (he broke his own record from 2009, when he threw for 70.6) total team yards on offense: 7,474   not having him in the top 10 is fucking madness"

Saints,3cl6vv,Charizard_Targaryen,5,Wed Jul 8 20:25:43 2015 UTC,The one where it bounced right off his hands for a pick 6 still haunts me. Hopefully it all comes together for him this year.
Saints,3cl6vv,FerociousLamb,5,Wed Jul 8 20:39:11 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but a fifth round pick by the name of Stills got more playing time than Toon and Toon had been on the team longer.   I saw a flash of something in Toon that I think may be what Payton and Brees are seeing everyday in practice. It was on a touchdown he scored where he broke several tackles and got in from like 10 yards out. Can't remember which game it was. Sorry.   I have high hopes for him."
Saints,3cl6vv,paradigmshift7,6,Wed Jul 8 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"True, but Stills isn't the same kind of receiver. We needed a deep threat and Stills fit the bill while our big receiver targets were a lock at their positions."
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,3,Wed Jul 8 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"yeah, you can't really compare a possession receiver who is probably best at the slot to an outside receiver who only ran variations of streak routes.   Stills kept Morgan off the field, Colston and Moore have kept Toon of the field most of his career."
Saints,3cl6vv,didntevenwarmupdho,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:11 2015 UTC,Morgans ACL and DUI's kept him off the field.
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:08:47 2015 UTC,Yeah because not being good enough is not enough.
Saints,3cl6vv,flordeliest,2,Thu Jul 9 21:17:51 2015 UTC,We needed a deep threat   Especially after Morgan tore his ACL in that preseason.
Saints,3cl6vv,jackmuhswag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. Cooks might fulfill that role,  maybe Joe Morgan but he's got to make the team first."

Saints,3cl6vv,dean815,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:52 2015 UTC,People were hyped as fuck about Toon a few years ago. I like the guy and want him to succeed but he just hasn't made moves.

He's been buried behind a grossly underrated receiving corps. Who was he supposed to start ahead of? Colston, the franchise leader in every receiving category or Jimmy Graham (can we all just admit Jimmy never was a tight end and any tall receiver could play the position he did for us, maybe just not as well)."
Saints,3cl6vv,Lokipokie504,3,Wed Jul 8 21:04:05 2015 UTC,He showed flashes last year. It just takes longer for some guys. I'm hoping this is the year he breaks out

Saints,3cl6vv,dean815,3,Thu Jul 9 05:57:24 2015 UTC,Josh Hill
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,0,Thu Jul 9 13:08:55 2015 UTC,Honestly I think Colston will play the closest role to Graham last season.
Saints,3cl6vv,CxHxUxBxBxS,4,Thu Jul 9 06:29:51 2015 UTC,We expect more from Nick Toon every season
Saints,3cl6vv,sarcastic_charisma,4,Wed Jul 8 21:47:53 2015 UTC,Arent we expecting something from Nick toon every year..I'm seeing a pattern here
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,3,Wed Jul 8 20:57:05 2015 UTC,"Well this year there's an open spot for him. Who was he going to start ahead of last season, Colston or Graham?"
Saints,3cl6vv,aimerj,-6,Wed Jul 8 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"It's really a shame, maybe if Toon had a couple 100 yard games we could have traded him and kept Stills! Fuck Nick Toon and U of Wisconsin"
Saints,3cl6vv,aimerj,7,Wed Jul 8 20:50:22 2015 UTC,We let Stills go due to other issues.
Saints,3cl6vv,Jthan254,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:08 2015 UTC,"I know we have had a lot of beat writers say that, but has there been an official statement by SP, Mickey or anyone else saying that? Obviously there were reasons to let him go, otherwise we wouldn't have, but those same things were said about Vaccaro and he's still on the team."
Saints,3cl6vv,aimerj,13,Wed Jul 8 20:55:41 2015 UTC,I think it was more about value. Vacarro and Stills was a partying duo. You trade one of them to hopefully break up the duo and solve the problem. Now this is where value comes into play. Do you trade a potential play making safety that was your 1st round draft pick(more money tied up) or a play making WR that was a 5th rd draft pick(less money tied up). Let's just hope Vaccaro calms down after his partner in crime was traded.
Saints,3cl6vv,dean815,3,Wed Jul 8 21:16:49 2015 UTC,I like this comment a lot.
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,2,Wed Jul 8 22:18:40 2015 UTC,Very good point
Saints,3cl6vv,aimerj,7,Thu Jul 9 13:09:28 2015 UTC,Most of what I know was from what people said on here.  That he was partying too hard with Vacarro and I know Peyton had some sideline issues with him.
Saints,3cl6vv,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:58:53 2015 UTC,"I don't care about the reason. Stills could have been an Eagle Scout, but the bottom line is we're a better team with Ellerbe and PJ Williams than we were with Stills.   Stills was good at one thing, stretching the field. But those type of receivers are very replaceable. It's not like we traded DeSean Jackson, who has the same skill set as Stills, but is better in every possible way.   Brees inflated the stats of a 5th round receiver who can only run variants of the same route to the point where another team thought he's worth a third round pick and a ILB known for coverage skills (what we sorely lacked)."
Saints,3cl6vv,Dabeston,3,Wed Jul 8 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"I agree on the trade making the team better, I much rather Toon had inflated stats and gotten traded than Stills."
Saints,3cl6vv,paradigmshift7,3,Wed Jul 8 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"Hell if that's what we're doing, I wish Willie Snead was the one with inflated stats.   I don't think you're going to get anyone arguing that Toon is a better receiver than Stills, but the fact of the matter is Stills was worth Ellerbe and PJ Williams where Toon had zero trade value.   But IMO, I'm OK with Toon as our No. 3 receiver. Nick Toon is a much better receiver than a lot of teams No. 3."
Saints,3cl6vv,aimerj,3,Wed Jul 8 22:50:20 2015 UTC,"What could Stills do that Cooks can't do better?   Neither can block outstanding do to their size, both are speed guys, idk.  I like Stills but there is only so much room on a team for small WRs who can't block."
Saints,3cl6vv,Dabeston,4,Wed Jul 8 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"And let's not forget that if cooks hadn't been injured, he likely would have had just as good (if not better) receiving numbers than Stills AS A ROOKIE.  I think cooks is the next Antonio Brown."

Saints,3cbog5,MistaChopstix,3,Mon Jul 6 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Last season is a little deceiving because he benefitted from things that Jimmy Graham caused. Three of his TDs came off blown coverage on play action when Graham was on the sideline. Teams won't stack the box like they did when Graham left the field, so that play won't work.  But I'm not saying he isn't going to do much better than 400 yards and 5 TDs. If Payton talks about a player like he's talked about Hill, you can't help but listen.

He only played 288 out of a possible 1,100. We don't even know if he can last a full season, much less produce at a high level.  But you're right.

Saints,3c9x4i,TheBionicShaboy,3,Mon Jul 6 18:32:01 2015 UTC,"Well it's a quick curl and Manning's first read, so his eyes aren't supposed to move from him.   Porter took a huge risk because he knew the play was coming. You can see him take two steps to the inside which puts him in perfect position to jump the inside curl. If it's any other route, Porter is burned for a big gain.   This was aided by the fact Wayne ran a bad route and let his man get inside. He was a bit slow getting out of his break, which let Porter take advantage."

The team has transitioned into a roster that has a lot of pieces for a really good running game. This will only make Brees and the defense better. I kind of think they'll be a sleeper in the NFC - maybe make it to the conference championship or even further...

Saints,3c1xx3,sfzen,5,Sat Jul 4 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"Projected lineup!   QB Drew Brees - aging, but still one of the all time greats. If he asked me, I'd suck his sweaty nuts. RB Mark Ingram - improved line. Ingram hungry. will ball for yards. RB CJ Spiller - look for him to line up all over the field. It's almost unfair that we got this guy. FB Eric Lorig - I like Austin Johnson more, but the coaches love Lorig, the erstwhile fuck-up. He's probably starting. TE Josh Hill - The Jimmy Graham era was a blast, but we gotta keep moving. TE Ben Watson - How much gas is left in the old fart? pfft. WR Marques Colston - We only need him for one last year as a reliable possession receiver. Let's hope the fumbles and drops last year were anomalies. WR Brandin Cooks - TOO MANY COOKS. This guys job is basically to make opponents look silly. He's a younger and faster Antonio Brown, and now he's got that 22 year old muscle coming in. Ejaculate. WR Nick Toon - It's now or never; Toon showed he was ready to step up last year. this is his contract year, and he's got the system down. just gotta whip it out and see how long and girthy his skills are. Probably won't lose his job to Morgan or Coleman or Jones. LT Terron Armstead - Awesome young LT. Third year gonna blast off to the next dimension of studliness. LG Tim Lelito - When you're the cream filling in an Unger/Armstead pastry, you've got an easier job. C Max Unger - The central link in the o-line that was missing last year. Call him the perforator, because he'll leave those chads hanging. RG Jahri Evans - Old Faithful. Muthafucka even took a paycut for us. Lovely. RT Zach Strief - Great blocker, but he's gonna have to pump up the jam so Peat doesn't derk 'is jerb. DL Akiem Hicks - contract year. will reveal his true nature. should be good. DL Cameron Jordan - The star of our defensive line. He's like Chad Kroeger, and the rest of our line just needs to not suck long enough to keep him pumping out the hits. DL Jonathan Jenkins - Hopefully Jenkins makes his big fat mark in his third year. He will likely take the starting NT spot from Bunkley. LB Stephone Anthony - Help us, Stephone Anthony Stephoney. You're our only hope. MLB of the present and future, barring disaster. LB Dannell Ellerbe - Likely a large improvement over Lofton. Please let me be right, for once in this godforsaken life.  LB Junior Gallette (?) - If the league doesn't suspend him, we certainly will put him on the field. We'll cut him next year or the year after, but for now, we need his mighty johnson. LB Hau'oli Kikaha - I think he's gonna get the nod over Haralson. Call it a hunch. CB Keenan Lewis - #1 CB on the field and in my heart and pants. CB Brandon Browner - #2 CB ready to chong some dongs as is his wont. CB Delvin Breaux - I'm calling it, Delvin is the nickel corner and, soon, he will be promoted to starter. the real canadian deal. SS Kenny Vaccaro - Played through injury last year. I expect he's ready to make some noise this year. FS Jairus Byrd - Revenge tour time. K Zach Hocker - whateva P Thomas Morstead - leggy lover, loves long punts down the field. KR CJ Spiller - we have a lot of competition, but he'll probably win this. PR Cooks - He's got as good a chance as anyone."

This is an offseason review, and here we have to look at all the other teams we play and speculate on stuff. this should be a different damn section. oh well, here it goes.   WEEK 1 @ Arizona   They've got a good D. we've got a good D. They've got a decent O. We've got Brees and co. Larry Fitzgerald retires midgame and the Cardinals all concede the game to honor his decision.  WIN 31-13. Suck it.   WEEK 2 Tampa bay   They've got Jameis Winston and Mike Evans, but we've got Brees and it's our first home game. Payton gazes sternly at the Bucs until they whimper and retreat meekly to their locker room.   WIN 24-20. So the mystes aver.   WEEK 3 @ Panthers   Cam smiles confidently and the whole stadium ""awwws"" at his countenance. Kelvin Benjamin shakes it off, realizing that he, too is handsome, and he walks in the only score of the game.  LOSS 6-0. Too cute.   WEEK 4 Dallas   Romo's disc slips on his first throw, and his vertebrae smash together, shattering into a thousand pieces. His spine telescopes, wrenching his back muscles together, and he folds backwards, cracking several more bones. His ribs detach and he gets flail chest, which sends his muscles into spasm, pulverizing the remainder of his back. Everything compresses to the point where light and time is affected and the world watches in horror and amazement as Romo is absorbed into himself.  WIN 49-0. maybe that's a little harsh.   WEEK 5 @ Eagles   By the end of the game, Chip has licked his lower face off, revealing himself to be a cyborg capable of making optimal, if unlikely, coaching decisions.   LOSS 31-34. Chip Kelly gets banned from the NFL after the game, though.   WEEK 6 Falcons   Julio Jones and Roddy White get arrested for moonlighting as male ""strippers."" Matt Ryan is lonely, so he quits the team to visit them in prison more often and smuggle them used jockstraps.  WIN 63-0. The way it was meant to be.   WEEK 7 - 17... this is ridiculous. Wanna know what I think?   we go at least 10-6.  we win the division. suck it, haters. suck my johnson.  Who's even gonna read this, anyway? you bunch of jackanapes.  Did anyone even look at my kuato-shop? I don't think anyone fully appreciates my cleverness. Not even my mom. moving on."

Saints,3c0bk5,IHaveNoFiya,2,Sun Jul 5 21:17:51 2015 UTC,I kinda feel bad for him since it looks like he has RB1 ability. I'm curious to see what kind of workload he can put up as a feature back but I'll just save that for Madden.  If Spiller is able to do inside runs better in our system then it'll mean even less touches for him.
Saints,3c0bk5,IAteTheFridge,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"The guy has some potential but not as an RB1 this year. With spiller as a receiving back and Ingram between the tackles, he could do work as a 3rd down/red zone threat at his height. I'm excited to have a crowded backfield this season."
Saints,3c0bk5,Sal_Incognito,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:43:30 2015 UTC,If he's smart he looked back at the past ~10 years and realizes he will get his touches no matter what.  That's just how we utilize our RB's.

Saints,3bzu4x,JshMcDwll,6,Fri Jul 3 14:32:48 2015 UTC,I forgot just how much I love this guy
Saints,3bzu4x,Simplename64,4,Fri Jul 3 15:02:11 2015 UTC,"Man, out of watching those highlights the thing that stuck out to me the most is that for Cooks to be getting the most out of those closer touches, all our other WRs need to be on their blocking game.    When he gets monster blocks from Armstead/TEs down field, he breaks long runs.  When Toon/Colston wiffed on the blocks he got bottled up early."
Saints,3bzu4x,Dabeston,2,Fri Jul 3 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"He could be another Antonio Brown in the making. He has the speed and agility, he just needs the experience now. If one of the other receivers can step up and prove to be a threat (Josh Morgan, Joe Morgan, Seantavious Jones, Brandon Coleman, Nick Toon) then I think Cooks has the potential to explode for our offense. But, (and this is a likely scenario) if only he and Colston are the established receivers and no one else steps up, it's going to be tough sledding for our passing game. We're going to need someone else to step up and draw coverage (be it a TE or another WR) in order for Cooks to really dominate."

Saints,3by2dc,Big-Zoo,6,Fri Jul 3 03:13:13 2015 UTC,"He's 30 now, probably won't accept the veteran minimum, and while he excels as a receiving back, he doesn't have the speed that most RB's do. Plus, rosters don't have to be cut down for a while, UDFA's and other young guys are still getting plenty of chances to make the team. I'm sure someone will pick him up once injuries start to happen and 3rd/4th RB's start running out of chances to keep a roster spot."
Saints,3by2dc,sfzen,3,Fri Jul 3 06:41:17 2015 UTC,Can't get any more dependable than Pierre Thomas. He has to be better than a lot of team's 3rd or 4th backs...
Saints,3by2dc,Interus,3,Fri Jul 3 17:27:18 2015 UTC,Roster spots are too valuable for old running backs not good enough to start and have little to no upside. Players get old and 20 or 30 new running backs come into the league every year.

Saints,3bk06w,admvp,8,Tue Jun 30 05:01:39 2015 UTC,Big bad evil hits! It's not like we even had to MAKE THE PLAY to make the hit...
Saints,3bk06w,baconlovr,2,Tue Jun 30 06:19:14 2015 UTC,"Cracks me up so much when people complain about that. ""But, but they hit him too hard!""  Are you kidding me? That's what football is all about. The program that we supposedly ran didn't pay for cartoffs or injuries. It paid for hard hits and making plays on the ball, which is EXACTLY what every defense in the league should be doing: hitting the ball carrier hard and trying to get the ball."
Saints,3bk06w,admvp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:33:52 2015 UTC,It didn't give you any advantage at all. Vikings fans are just pissed off about the hits Favre took. Vikings fans felt they were cheated when bounty gate came out
Saints,3bk06w,Saints2Death,-4,Thu Jul 2 08:13:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I can't believe I'm here, but this is about as blatant as an illegal hit gets. Notice the ball nowhere near the guy.

Saints,3bk06w,admvp,3,Wed Jul 1 20:27:16 2015 UTC,There were two guys going for the QB simultaneously. It's a bad play and should have been called a penalty but if you actually watch the play they just both came in at the same time from different angles. I don't understand why you guys can't see that it is difficult to stop yourself mid-lunge when you weigh 300 lbs.
Saints,3bk06w,dean815,-1,Wed Jul 1 12:48:54 2015 UTC,That excuse has never been a legitimate reason for not calling the penalty though
Saints,3bk06w,nubosis,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:08 2015 UTC,But it also doesn't support the argument that the alleged bounties gave us an advantage. If you're saying poor officiating gave us an advantage I can understand where you're coming from.
Saints,3bk06w,ProfoundlyProfound,-1,Wed Jul 1 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying. I place pretty much all the blame on the refs, the bounty stuff is really just low hanging fruit against the Saints, as I'm sure you understand."

You gotta be pretty stupid if that's your take on it. You do realize it's the defense's job to stop/tackle/hit/intercept the QB right?   You do realize Favre is the INTERCEPTION KING OF FOOTBALL, complete with record and all right?  You realize the guys creaming him are only a few years younger right?  You realize Bountygate was the Comish's attempt to make it look like he gave a shit about player safety, and it completely blew up in his face because rather than go after the league has a whole, he tried to make an example out of the Saints over Gregg Williams lying to him?  You noobs are trying to equate that minuscule (to them) sums of money, literally thousands, to millionaires for making good plays as being this big incentive to an all encompassing Saints only cheat going on and the sole reason you lost?    Some shit went on, no doubt, but nowhere near what you assclowns are always trying to make it out to be, nowhere near as bad. This is shit that has gone on league wide, most likely every single team for a very long time, and admittedly so by quite a few players and coaches on various teams.  You got into a game with a steam rolling, unstoppable offense and a ball hawking defense against a statistically easy to intercept passer.   If you  have any doubt, watch the game that year against Washington. (Watch Meachem strip a ball  from a defender that was intended for him and intercepted, watch as Meach runs it in for a TD) Still have doubts? Watch the Superbowl and what they did to Manning.   You're telling me a team that didn't lay Manning out, systematically shut his ass down, and picked that team apart, cheated in that game too? They outclassed Payton Fucking Manning, with pure skill, and you're whining about a loss with a QB who was at the end of his career, blaming everything BUT him?   Hate to break it to you but the Vikes weren't the only team who had never won a SB before.....hell we'd never even been, that was incentive enough to lay the old man out. You were up against one hungry 3 headed monster ( offense, defense and coaching)."

Sure, you guys won the Super Bowl and beat Payton Fucking Manning, Favre did throw that interception and that was his fault. It is a defense's job to stop/tackle/hit/intercept, no shit, but was HURT/INJURE in a defense's job... Stop making excuses"

I remember the pass rush drills this guy with the crazy hair performing on another level than every one else. I followed up on him tapes stats etc, and b/c of his injury and slow 40 knew he would be a steal for someone.  I couldnt believe we drafted him and if he can stay healthy he will be the best pick of the draft."
Saints,3bj8dm,Hotdog_Skin,5,Fri Jul 3 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"With Galette's antics, I can't help but feel all our eggs are in one basket with Kikaha. Yes, we have spencer and edebali and the later-round draft picks etc, but it seems like we have A LOT riding on Kikaha's success."
Saints,3bj8dm,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Kikaha will definitely be an option to replace Galette on passing downs, but if Galette ends up missing a lot of time, expect 4 man fronts where Cam is the smallest guy with his hand on the ground especially on rushing downs. Kikaha run support definitely needs to be improved and he'll be swallowed by most tackles on runs to his side."
Saints,3bj8dm,Megawatts19,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:23:35 2015 UTC,"I know he gets knocked for his size, but it's true. There have been small OLBs that can make the transition, but Kikaha will be at a severe disadvantage on run plays against NFL tackles. I hope he can develop."
Saints,3bj8dm,Saints2Death,2,Tue Jun 30 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's as small as he's listed on our site. The Combine was 5 months ago, and he was over 250 pounds then, and the combine uses clinical measurements. I see him playing around 255 during the season, which is about what Galette weighs."

Saints,3bj8dm,flordeliest,-2,Tue Jun 30 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"Kikaha is not the same type of linebacker as Galette. I'm 90% sure we drafted him with the intention of replacing Haralson, not Galette."

Saints,3bj8dm,flordeliest,0,Mon Jun 29 20:19:52 2015 UTC,"Just because Kikaha is rotating in at OLB doesn't mean he can replace Galette role-wise. He doesn't have the size to be a 4-3 DE or to line-up at the LOS every down like Galette can.  I really doubt we drafted Kikaha just to be a situational rusher. Isn't it more likely he is the strong side replacement for Haralson? The position he played in college. Kihkaha had 19 college sacks but it wasn't on the weakside. He played the run, dropped into coverage, blitzs from behind the tackles, as well as lined-up outside. He isn't a one dimensional rush OLB like Galette."
Saints,3bj8dm,Saints2Death,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:09 2015 UTC,He played mostly defensive end in college. What are you talking about?
Saints,3bj8dm,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really make sense to me.  Haralson seems to be a run-support type of guy, and kikaha is touted as a pass rusher..  And honestly, that's the main knock against galette in terms of skillset.  He is a phenomenal pass rusher, but average if not below average against the run."
Saints,3bj8dm,flordeliest,0,Mon Jun 29 22:07:47 2015 UTC,Kikaha is not below average against the run. Kikaha doesn't have the size to line up at the LOS every down like Galette. Doesn't it make more sense that we drafted Kikaha to play opposite of Galette at the Sam? Especialy after Edebali proved to be a reliable option behind Galette.
Saints,3bj8dm,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 29 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't have the size, why are the coaches putting him in at that position with the first team?"
Saints,3bj8dm,flordeliest,0,Mon Jun 29 23:01:33 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Spencer took majority of Galette's vacated snaps and Kikaha rotated out with Haralson. Like how Anthony rotated with Hawthorne.

Stunned silence with lots of looks of disbelief as Graham dunked the ball over the goal post and yelled at the crowd.  Drew didn't even hesitate.

Saints,3bimx4,Emleaux,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:59:01 2015 UTC,2011 and yes that was one of the most well placed balls I've ever seen.
Saints,3bimx4,ADMVP23,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:02:01 2015 UTC,Will look it up. Can't remember it to be honest.
Saints,3bimx4,ADMVP23,2,Fri Jul 3 14:57:07 2015 UTC,I've always dug this play. This was the first game of the 2009 season and Drew really set the tone with 6 TD passes. The pass to Devery at 3:43 was pretty awesome as well.
Saints,3bimx4,NFLVideoConverterBot,3,Mon Jun 29 17:59:11 2015 UTC,Holy interceptions I miss those turnover differentials on that defense.
Saints,3bimx4,psquared85,2,Mon Jun 29 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"The video is not loading on NFL.com, but a real good one is the rushing TD that Brees had against Miami in 2009 where he celebrated by dunking on the goalpost, so as to tell the Dolphins to shove it up their ass for passing on him in free agency. The comeback in that game was bonkers."

Saints,3bj85s,ohhgod,6,Mon Jun 29 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"Dennis Allen kind of makes this an interesting equation.  Let's say the defense does turn it around, who's to say it's not because of Dennis?  At any rate, they've probably already found Ryan's replacement if he does get canned."
Saints,3bj85s,assasinine,2,Mon Jun 29 22:09:47 2015 UTC,I agree with you.  But i really like Ryan. In have read in an article (I'm too lazy to seek said article) that Ryan and Allen are like Ying and Yang. It would be awesome if they would complete each other and create a really good defense.
Saints,3bj85s,hrafnass,4,Tue Jun 30 11:12:27 2015 UTC,He will be out the door if he produces anything less than a top 20 defense.
Saints,3bj85s,baconlovr,3,Mon Jun 29 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"Depends on your definition of down. If they suck ass again, he's gone. Top 15 and we make the playoffs? He's still there."

Saints,3bh08v,flordeliest,10,Mon Jun 29 04:03:40 2015 UTC,"I happened to stumble upon a charity event at Top Golf in Austin today with Drew Brees.  He was throwing footballs with some people who undoubtedly forked over a ton of cash to his foundation. As you can see in the video, an organizer suggests that Brees throw with a ""QB . . . from West Lake HS."" I don't know if that's true or not - or even what the kid's name was, but Drew seemed to be having fun - even after they announced that the kid won.  I know this is super irrelevant, and I hope I'm not breaking any rules of the sub. I just figured that we're in the thick of offseason, and I would love anything like this if it were about my Texans. Hope the best for you guys this year - kind of sucks that Payton bailed because of hard knocks.  So long, and fuck the colts!"
Saints,3bh08v,flordeliest,13,Mon Jun 29 03:45:09 2015 UTC,Just so you know Drew Brees went to West Lake High School. So they could be talking about him.  Quality post.
Saints,3bh08v,Rampantlion513,5,Mon Jun 29 04:11:22 2015 UTC,No they brought in west lakes current QB but I think drew still won
Saints,3bh08v,Rampantlion513,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:59:00 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain that kid plays for Westlake - I don't know where he sits on the depth chart, but there's more of them talking about it that I didn't record.  And they have the W to the kid - I just didn't get that either."
Saints,3bh08v,sfzen,2,Mon Jun 29 13:00:55 2015 UTC,Again they both played at westlake so they could be referring to either one.
Saints,3bh08v,baconlovr,3,Mon Jun 29 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Brees went to West Lake, so it was a bit of a homecoming for him. They brought out the current school QB, so it was Brees vs his eventual successor."

Saints,3bh08v,Hotdog_Skin,3,Mon Jun 29 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"I wish they had both thrown at a further target. It was only 10 yards away, tops.  I would have loved to watch him hit someone 30 yards away and watch the kid try to do something close."

Saints,3bh08v,-Ran,2,Mon Jun 29 06:25:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was pretty cool to see him throw while I was that close. I wanted them to build an obstacle course for him - but it was hot out there, and they were rushing him inside for the charity event."

They tried to get the court to rule that his children should be given the power to run his businesses.  If my kids did that, I would disown them too.  It's easily one of the most insulting and disrespectful things I can ever imagine a child doing to their parents in the name of money.  The kids are just being spoiled, petty little shit heads.  They deserve it."
Saints,3b7sfv,saints_fan85,11,Fri Jun 26 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"well to their defense, he disowned them before the trial began. Not trying to back them up in any way possible, I'm just curious to the matter myself."
Saints,3b7sfv,Breesus-Walks,15,Fri Jun 26 17:56:43 2015 UTC,"While it's true that he disowned them after the fights between Rita and his wife, there's more to the story. Rita is known throughout New Orleans as being a borderline unstable tyrant. The woman went through something like 40 personal assistants in a few years. His kids are primarily worried because Gayle is of very strong Christian faith, and some of this seems to have rubbed off on Tom. He's become quite the philanthropist in his old age (and its very apparent, because he was damn tightfisted with his money before), and I think that's the crux of the conflict. His kids are mad that their inheritance is being donated at an ever increasing rate. As such, he disinherited them, but just from the businesses and the like. They'll still get beauxcoup money when he dies, but Benson doesn't want them running any of his businesses anymore.  On top of that, his son is a tool, Rita is a little crazy, as mentioned above, and no one in the Saints organization wanted to work with her, even when she was heir apparent. It certainly seems like Benson raised some seriously spoiled brats, and he's pretty much stated he's tired of their entitled bullshit and too old to be dealing with that kind of stress, and that's pretty telling to me. If my 80-some-odd-year-old dad came out and basically said that my shenanigans were the biggest source of stress in his life, I would be humbled. His kids just sued him instead."
Saints,3b7sfv,kampfschafe,14,Fri Jun 26 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember Benson was no Saint either. Gayle made him realize a legacy of being an utter jackass is no legacy. Under Gayle's watchful eye Benson went from pariah to philanthropist. They let him build a statute to himself outside of the Superdome. There is a building baring his name and no one scoffs at it. None of that would likely have happened without Gayle whispering ""don't be an insufferable prick"" in his ear. Benson has seen the light, his kids have not."
Saints,3b7sfv,pottersquash,6,Fri Jun 26 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"You have to look at it from his point of view.  Born in New Orleans he saved the team from being moved to Jacksonville, FL.  Imagine being Saints fan then becoming the Owner of the Saints.  It was a dream come true.  This dream was unsuccessful though.  Imagine going to work everyday to a team that would constantly lose.  Now imagine leaving work to go home to your wife, Ms. Grace, that is dying of Parkinson's disease.  You are a liar if you would say that you would still be a cheery motherfucker.  Now he won a Superbowl, has a great team, and a healthy wife that he loves.  It was thanks to Ms. Gayle, but not because she was whispering ""don't be an insufferable prick"" in his ear.  The dude is finally happy.  He just wants to keep the happy train going and this trial isn't helping that.  He cried cutting his family off.  Now this doesn't justify how he acts in the past or now, but realize that he isn't just grumpy for being grumpy's sake."
Saints,3b7sfv,nolahca,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"Don't disagree with that at all. As I said above, Gayle has softened Benson, and his kids obviously got their behavior from somewhere close to home."

It ranges from them being entitled brats living in the life of luxury with no thought of their actions' consequences, all the way up to the way they treated people who worked for them and the fans. It all came to a head when Benson decided his legacy was in jeopardy with the way things were going, so he shifted everything over to his wife, who not only is a gracious person, but who cares for the fans and employees under Benson."

Saints,3b45un,defeatedbycables,3,Fri Jun 26 02:17:41 2015 UTC,"Falcons and I'll tell you why. I lived in New Orleans for 5 years and got sucked into Saints fandom in 2009, like many others, so I don't know  the historical reasons. But first of all, Roddy White is a loudmouth and they love Roddy White. I think he sums up the team, immature, not in their prime anymore, just kind of whack. But whenever the two teams play, you can tell the players just despise each other. One team will always come out of the game looking softer, there's never a ""respectable loss"" when these two teams play. And the shit talking after games between fan bases is absolutely vicious. Some of my best friends were Falcons fans, but we never respected each other when it came to football. Falcons fans are just as arrogant as Roddy White. I can't tell you how many Falcons fans would show up at Saints bars on Sundays just to show off all their Falcons gear and get into stupid arguments with any Saints fan dumb enough to acknowledge them. They are just scum, and that's why they're our main rivals. I would say that we're still a bit ""chippy"" with the 49ers (their fans are the worst in the league), the Vikings don't like us (more so the fans), and if you aren't a Patriots fan, you have to hate the Patriots."
Saints,3b45un,Saints2Death,2,Fri Jun 26 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"Strategy - Honestly playing Madden taught me more about strategy than anything else. You learn the formations, defensive schemes, the advantages of situational plays, and the frustration at the sheer physics-breaking anomalies that happen sometimes. Besides that, it really helped to read basic information about strategy. No lie, I used this Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_strategy) as my hub for introducing myself to strategy. After I learned the basics, I searched up Youtube videos of plays, highlights, games, etc. Once you realize how much of a chess game football is, you're hooked.

Saints,3b45un,hrafnass,3,Fri Jun 26 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, hopefully I'll get there slowly but surely. Also is there any players I should look out for this season? Andrus peat I'm guessing of course and maybe brandin cooks? Now that he's got a years experience in the NFL under his belt"
Saints,3b45un,metrotastic,2,Fri Jun 26 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"Andrus Peat - Our (first) first round pick. It's going to be interesting to see how the OLine camp battle turns out, because Terron Armstead is a left tackle with huge upside. Look out for where they place him on the OLine and who he replaces.  Stephone Anthony - Our linebacking corps have been our weakness for several seasons. His role is important because the middle linebacker is essentially the quarterback of the defense.  Brandin Cooks - His season was cut short by an injury that sidelined him. Look out for a breakout year. There's a possibility he'll be the #1 target this season with the loss of Graham and Stills as well as an aging Colston.  Jairus Byrd - He was a huge free agency acquisition last season but ended up on injured reserve very early on in the season. He is a free safety, which means he's the safety that mainly roams the field looking for pass deflections and interceptions. He's known as a ""ball hawk"" but we haven't really seen him play up to his reputation yet.  Mark Ingram - My personal favorite. Heisman trophy winner, a first round pick, and was labeled a bust for his first few seasons. Once the offense switched to a zone running scheme (where Bama running backs excel) he became a total beast. He missed a few games this season, but was on pace to be one of the top 10 running backs in the league. Now that he's in a system that sets him up to excel, look out for a 1,000 yard season from him. He also signed a 4-year extension so he's committed to the team.  Those are the ones that first come to mind. CJ Spiller and Brandon Browner are up there too but I don't know too much about them yet. Other Who Dats, feel free to add to this list!"
Saints,3b45un,IAteTheFridge,3,Fri Jun 26 03:18:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for being knowledgeable to point out the switch to zone blocking leading to Ingram's resurrection.  Far too many people say it was a contract year therefore he played harder.

Saints,3b0sg6,MistaChopstix,20,Thu Jun 25 01:28:12 2015 UTC,"Behind Wilson and Roethlisberger don't bother me.  Wilson has led his team to a Super Bowl for two straight years, and his statistics aren't bad at all. He's a different kind of QB and his stats aren't comparable to a volume thrower like Brees.   Roethlisberger had a career year and beat Brees in several metrics.  Last year Brees, looking over the past 5 seasons, was at a low in yards and TDs and was at 2nd worst in INTs and Rating.  Basically my point is, over the past 5 years, last year was Brees' worst year, and Big Ben and Wilson are coming off career years in more statistics. That doesn't automatically mean I think those two are better than Brees, because I don't, but I understand why they ranked them ahead of him."
Saints,3b0sg6,Saints2Death,2,Thu Jun 25 01:42:21 2015 UTC,"Based solely on last season, yeah, I can understand Wilson and Roethlisberger being ahead of him. Roethlisberger threw for exactly the same number of yards as Brees, one fewer TD, and 8 fewer INT's, and while Wilson didn't come close statistically, he did have over 800 rushing yards and 6 TD's, and he led his team to the Super Bowl. Plus, the fact that he's still young and getting even better definitely plays a factor in voting, even if it's not supposed to."

Saints,3b0sg6,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:29:26 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, it was expected. And it's a weird ranking system because it's like best players as well as the expectation going forward. Because even though his stats weren't good and the team didn't do so well, he was still one of the few good things to like about the Saints.  There were many games where Brees was a big reason why we won those games, but there were more games where Brees was a big reason why we didn't win as well. But even after all that, for last year, I think he should be in the top 25 at least. But if you account for how many people are doubting us that aren't on this subreddit or even in the NFL subreddit (though I think there are still a lot of people that think we actually got worse), but in general media, that Brees is on the decline and the team getting ""worse"" will just exaggerate how bad our team will be going into this upcoming season."

And my thoughts is out of the 29 players ranked higher than Brees, I'm going to bet that the vast majority of them are players on teams that finished above 8-8.   IMO 30th is great for a QB on a team who finished with losing records two of the last three years. I doubt many players on teams with losing records even made this list, much less the top half of the list.   Players on better teams get more votes for the MVP, for the Heisman Trophy, for offensive and defensive players of the year, ect. Why wouldn't players on winning teams get more votes here too?"

Saints,3b15lq,makeplayz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:51:22 2015 UTC,"Oh hell, I make that point all the time.   I don't know how universally everyone agrees that Brees has made some great plays that won us games, but with blind rage fight you tooth or nail if you say that Brees has made some terrible plays that lost us games.   Case and Point: The Browns game. We were ahead by 6 points with less than 3 minutes remaining in the game when Brees made one of the worst throws in his career when was intercepted and ran back to the Browns red zone and a few plays later scored a TD with not enough time for us to mount any comeback.   Yes, I understand we wouldn't have been in the lead if it wasn't for Brees, but the game was all but over when he made the mistake that cost us the game."

That's why im in love with this off season. Unger and Spiller got me pumped. I feel like now we may try to close games out by running the ball. And actually make the run game a threat, early, so things will open up in PA. I've been saying we need to run the ball more for a while. But we've become pass heavy. Andy Reid was criticized for this in Philly.   I do think our defense was shit last year, but they might've played better, had our offense been more efficient. The timing of turnovers and the position we put our defense in last year wasn't pretty."
Saints,3b15lq,makeplayz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as too much of a problem. We can win a Super Bowl with an unbalanced offense if we had a defense worth a shit.  Fixing our defense will win us many more games than balancing our offense. We were the No. 1 offense last season as lope sided as we were, and although Brees threw 17 interceptions (many of which cost us the game), we wouldn't have been in those situations nor would they have been so costly if we didn't have the No. 31 defense in the NFL."

I do wish they could find a way to get him out of here, but I don't think it'll happen before next offseason. If they do cut him, the amount of other roster moves that need to be made in general to get us back below the cap would probably throw us out of contention for the NFC South title almost immediately.   They definitely didn't waste a pick on Kikaha but I don't think they expected him to be the #1 at either outside linebacker position from day 1. He may easily replace Haralson on the other side and/or fight for snaps with Spencer and Edebali for what was Galette's spot if he doesn't play.  Don't think we'd switch to 4-3 more just because we don't have Galette. Among other defense transition issues, do you really want them throwing more than one of our ""average on a good day"" DT's out on the field at one?"
Saints,3azm0r,overratedfood,6,Wed Jun 24 23:56:39 2015 UTC,"This has become a league issue and I'm assuming he may go ahead with the surgery because he was told the NFL will probably impose some type of punishment based on the video that was released. I'm not entirely sure he will be cut by the team, but things do not look good for Galette in 2015 at least. Again, all speculation."
Saints,3azm0r,baconlovr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:20:03 2015 UTC,"This. Situations like this have to be determined by Goodell, and until we know something of what Goodell is planning to do, it's hard to speculated the best course of action. There's just too many variables like if/when he is suspended, what's the time table of the injury with or without surgery, what are the plans going forward with the cap situation ect.   IMO, if Goodell rules the same way as Hardy, Rice, Peterson and Galette misses all of 2015, I think it's common sense to get rid of the guy when the new league year starts. But if the punishment is less severe than expected, I still say we are a better team with Galette than without Galette whether it's 2015, 2016 or 2017."
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,6,Wed Jun 24 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that the organization is waiting to see what the league will do before making their move. He's a good player, but I'm just tired of his antics. If that's how he acts in public and on social media, he can't be very good in the locker room either. I would be happy if the Saints can offload him, and let some of the young bucks step up in his place.  EDIT: speeling"
Saints,3azm0r,Johnny-Rico,2,Wed Jun 24 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"Kikaha is about 15 lighter than Gallete and Ryan already said he will be playing the Sam OLB position rotating with if not starting over Haralson.  Edebali is the conceivable next man up at the Rush OLB position, then Spencer. Though I doubt how much he has left.  I'm 99 percent sure that that is Gallete in the video. His actions are inexcusable but I'm not sure how the NFL will issue discipline. It was back in 2013, it isn't domestic violence and might not even qualify as assalt considering the , and we lack a lot of context concerning the actually incident. Considering the NFL's track record he might get kick out of the league or just receive a fine.   If we do end up cutting him its like 4.1  mil on this years cap yearly salary and 12 mil on next year(basically the rest of the 16mil guaranteed he's already received) which would suck."

Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:22:48 2015 UTC,At like 37 second he says he is moving away from a hyrbryd DE position he played in Washington. He also says he is surprised at the type of drills he has been asked to do.
Saints,3azm0r,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you making a huge leap here, and regardless you said in the exact words ""Which is what both Payton and Ryan have already said.""  Show me where Payton and Ryan said Kikaha won't compete at Galette's position while Galette is hurt."
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:53:34 2015 UTC,They said this before he was hurt. Insist all you want.
Saints,3azm0r,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:55:26 2015 UTC,source?
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:59:09 2015 UTC,Kikaha also said he's learning pass rusher technique from Spenser and Galette specifically. Do you just ignore that because it doesn't fit the narrative you created?
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:56:42 2015 UTC,Also he never says the words defensive end in the entire interview. I heard it three times now. Why are you lying?
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,2,Thu Jun 25 15:59:54 2015 UTC,"We cant cut him this year, because the cap hit would be too high. We'd have to restructure Drew or cut a few people just to afford cutting Galette this year.  I could see us IR'ing him, or trying to get the league to give him an ADP-style suspension for the year, then cutting him next year.  But I still say it's most likely he plays this season, at least some. I cant see him getting many cheers when he runs out of the tunnel as a defensive starter though. In fact, I wouldnt be surprised to hear a bunch of boos. The crowd was pretty brutal on Jason David towards the end whenever they would announce defensive starters at home games."
Saints,3azm0r,daybreaker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"my cousin does QC work for Jeff Ireland and he told me he heard Loomis and them planning to ship #93 and next year's 2nd round pick to NYJ for their 4th (2016) and  5th (2017), plus Ik Empemkali by the end of the week.  My cousin tells me from personal experience that Junior is a real piece of shit. He takes toiletries on the regular from the training facility to stock his house and he's pretty sure Galette has a heroin problem."
Saints,3azm0r,swamptech,4,Wed Jun 24 22:25:56 2015 UTC,I just don't see this happening.  Galette is on the verge of a suspension.  He has NO value until that suspension has been handed down and served.  I just don't see anyone making a trade for Galette.
Saints,3azm0r,smokeajay,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:08:06 2015 UTC,they are confident he won't be suspended by the league ....much like Marshawn Lynch's altercation with bar patrons 2 years ago  the heroin thing is a known issue from years ago - dirty little secret no one talks about. he is a casual user.
Saints,3azm0r,swamptech,3,Thu Jun 25 02:09:18 2015 UTC,he's pretty sure Galette has a heroin problem.   Wait what? How is he pretty sure? That's oddly specific.
Saints,3azm0r,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:37:14 2015 UTC,He needs to go. One way or another. We fucked up when we signed after a single 12 sack season. Cut our loses before it poisons the locker room.
Saints,3azm0r,quantumhed,2,Wed Jun 24 21:25:05 2015 UTC,Galette has had 22 sacks in the last two seasons.
Saints,3azm0r,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:51:48 2015 UTC,we signed him after the 12 sack season. The contract was before last season.

Saints,3axirg,hrafnass,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:14:06 2015 UTC,"i don't deny that brees made some terrible decisions last year but this decisions were mostly made under pressure (collapsing pocket, try to force a td/first down because of trailing,...). I didn't watch a Pats game (other then the SB) but i assume Brady didn't have that much pressure (deflategate pun not intended).  Will Brees have another 5.000yrd season? I don't think so but not because he declined. Payton wants to add good ground game to his pass heavy offense, so that opponent defense have it much more complicated (and because it worked 2009).  But to use ""Brees will not have another 5.000yrd season"" argument is really stupid, Brady/Manning both only have 1 each in their records."

But take a look at a lot of those games... there were a bunch of close ones. We rarely won the close ones. Early on Archie was hit quite a bit, which naturally had a toll on his body. 10 years into his career - heck 5 years in - he couldn't do what he could when he was younger, but he was still great."
Saints,3avd96,kweeche,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"Why did those teams suck so bad? Was it the front office just whiffing on every pick or the coaching staff not being able to utilize talent, because to me it seemed like every draft was focused on bring in people to help Archie.   From 71 to 81, the Saints drafted 8 offensive players in the first round, 6 of which were Top 10 picks and a QB, WR and 2 RBs were Top 5 picks.   Archie was the No. 2 over all pick in 71  Royce Smith (guard) was the No. 8 overall pick in 72  Larry Burton (WR) was the No. 7 pick and Kurt Schumacher (G) was the No 12 in 75.  Chuck Muncie (RB) was the Ni, 3 pick in 76  Wes Chandler (WR) was the No. 3 pick in 78  Stan Brock (T) was the No. 12 pick in 80  George Rogers (RB) was the No. 1 pick in 81."

Growing up I had heard that Muncie and Rogers were traded because they had cocaine addictions.   They were also trading firsts for Earl Campbell and Richard Todd. (Steve Walsh was traded for, what, a 1st, 2nd and 3rd though that was later.)  Brock was a great player.   In 1979 they took Russell Erxleben 11th overall. You just can't do that. Rogers went over LT, Lindsay Scott was a #1 pick who couldn't play. When they drafted Muncie, they took another RB in the second round, Tony Galbreath. Galbreath was fine, but I can't think of a team going RB in the first two rounds consecutively elsewhere in my lifetime.  The 67-80 Saints show what happens if a franchise just basically doesn't have a first or second round pick ever."

Saints,3avd96,dean815,4,Wed Jun 24 23:41:49 2015 UTC,"My dad grew up watching Archie at Ole Miss (even though my family was an MSU and USM family) and in New Orleans. His opinion is pretty much the same as the consensus: he was a great player on a horrible team. I don't have any first-hand knowledge to refute anything you said. But remember that just because the front office drafted a lot of offensive players during his tenure doesn't mean they were any good. It could also have something to do with him being the first true star player in Saints history. Either way, my dad loved him."

Morgan got a DUI, but that was handled extremely well by the FO and Morgan.   There was rumblings about Stills and Vaccarro acting like... well, their age, out partying until late, but that's not really noteworthy drama.   I guess you could mention Will Smith and his domestic violence issue (which people like to conveniently forget when crucifying our team dumbass, junior). But Smith was ages ago, and is no longer on the team anyways.   I dunno. I think that's one of the trademarks of Payton's locker room. He prefers character over talent.  Just my opinion."

And there's no way I can believe that Brees' completion percentage isn't greatly affected by Payton's play calling. Brees must lead the league in number of screens, short slants and TE seams thrown."
Saints,3ardfq,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:14:10 2015 UTC,"Per PFF, since 2007 (that's how far back their data goes), Brees has never been above 13th in the NFL in Deep passing attempt % (deep passes attempted/passes attempted). He definitely doesn't do it as often as most. But when he does, he's filthy. His ranks in completed passes of 20+ yds since 2007:  2007: 15th  2008: 1st  2009: 1st  2010: 1st  2011: 2nd  2012: 1st  2013: 3rd  2014: 8th  He also led or co-led the league in deep passing TDs every year from 2008 to 2013, and led the league in deep passing completion % in 2009 and 2010."
Saints,3ardfq,dean815,0,Tue Jun 23 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"It's Payton's system. 90% of the time the Saints receivers run really efficient routes, and 10% of the time he throws the ball deep (usually down the sideline) to keep teams honest and to exploit teams that get too aggressive covering short passes."

And spare me any self defense, mistaking identity, or it happened two years ago argument against Galette being suspended. This is NFL's court, not a criminal case. Goodell has been very adamant on if you strike a woman for any reason, you're suspended. He doesn't need an arrest or even a guilty verdict.

Historical context plays a big part when appeasing fan bases, unfortunately.  When you're starved for talent at a position, you marry the first hint of a star and pray everything works out. Junior was great fighting to make the roster years ago making league minimum.  He had a lot of hustle.  12 sacks? He accounted for 29% of all of the Saints sacks in the past 2 seasons. However, he started 32 games and give or take the full 1053 pass attempts against the Saints during that time...12 sacks a season (24 total if you want to include safeties) doesn't really amount to shit."

Saints,3ar7vl,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"We didn't have him locked. It would be the same situation as Rafael Bush where Atlanta gave him a contract we had to match. If we didn't lock him up when we did, the open market would have dictated how much we had to pay to retain Galette, and pass rusher who have back-to-back 10+ sack seasons generally get paid more than Galette is making now on the open market.  The only thing waiting would have done was keep us out from under all the dead money, which wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for personal issues.  Edit: But my expertise in RFA extend to Bush's contract and that weird situation with Steve Hutchinson when he left Seattle."

I don't know how a guy with the success he has still finds himself in this company and getting into this sort of shit.   All that said, this is obviously very different than any sort of domestic abuse case we've seen. Personally, as a person who entirely avoids violence, doesn't get in fights, doesn't objectify women, etc., I'm at a loss in explaining this logically. If he hadn't hit any of the women at all, this would never have surfaced, I guarantee it. Obviously you shouldn't hit women, but isn't a better message to send that you shouldn't hit people? He's an idiot for hitting anyone but I don't think there was any difference to him whether it was a man or a woman in front of him when he swung that belt. It wasn't a case of a man systematically dominating a woman with physical force.   Anyway, I'm done defending him. This kind of shit is ridiculous. Let's hope Kikaha is the real deal."

Saints,3aq8od,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:28:47 2015 UTC,"Now that I had to think about it, the idea that it was self defense is insane.   We know that Junior Galette (6'2 250 pound football player) was with four other in shape guys. So Junior had a crew of 5 people in that fight. Count the number of men total in that video?   Outside of Junior's crew, there's the guy without a shirt who attacks Junior at the start and then gets in a fight with Junior's friend in the green shirt right before Junior knocks out a dude with one punch.   You have a guy in a green shirt who threw no punches and is actively trying to pull people out of the fight.   You have a shirtless dude in red shorts who is never seen fighting and looks like he's with the guy with the green shirt who is trying to break up the fight.   And a guy in a black shirt that comes in at the end looking to break up the fight and gets clocked by Junior.  The rest of the people in that video are women and Junior's crew.   So by my count, it's a bunch of women with one guy who wants to fight, three guys that want the fight to stop Vs. Junior's 5 man crew who have obviously been drinking.   What's the most likely scenario, a bunch of women and and the guy in Blue shorts picking a fight with a 6'2 250 pound football player and his four in shape friends or that one of Juniors crew, who more than likely had been drinking, got a little overly aggressive with one of those women and the guy and the women took offense?"

The facts we do have is:    Galette was with four other guys with at least two alcohol bottles, all of which at one point threw punches on the video. Only 4 other men were in the video and only one of them was shown throwing a punch. By my count, only 4 women were even showing physical aggression during the video."

Saints,3amwrb,maddlabber829,5,Sun Jun 21 22:44:20 2015 UTC,"My thoughts before the trade.  My feelings remain the same. It's always been Drew Brees that makes the receivers, not the other way around. Jimmy Graham is a great talent obviously, so it's easy to see why he and Brees had so much success together, but I think an all-pro center does way more for the offense all around. I love the direction the Saints went this off season, getting stronger in the trenches and on defense. Also, I don't know what happened with the Gresham talks, but I'm of the opinion that he could easily match Graham's production under Brees if healthy. As an OU fan, I'd like to see him on the Saints after we got rid of Lofton and Stills."

Saints,3amwrb,IAteTheFridge,2,Sun Jun 21 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, but if we wait to assess the trade until finding out of Anthony pans out or not will take years."
Saints,3amwrb,cfiggis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"Well who wins in this trade will only be determined in time.  As far as what i think of it, it hasnt changed since the day we made the trade. I think it was a great deal for both sides. Concerning us we have depth at Te with vet Ben Watson and young but proven he can play Josh hill. We needed a C, bad, and for sure needed upgrade at Mlb, even if we kept lofton who i wasnt a fan of. I also think Peat is the real addition here b/c if we didnt have the extra pick i cant see us taken a LT, with our only 1st rounder, maybe a pass rusher at that spot and anthony in the 2nd, or a possible trade back.  Concerning seatle they needed a receiving threat and have a young team so the draft pick doesnt affect them as much. Only time will tell who wins here but i think this is the right move giving us a better chance to win ""now"" than if we didnt make the trade."
Saints,3amwrb,IAteTheFridge,3,Mon Jun 22 10:20:46 2015 UTC,nope. great deal
Saints,3amwrb,pottersquash,3,Sun Jun 21 23:47:18 2015 UTC,"I know it's an unpopular opinion in this thread but I'm still not okay with it. As much as Brees relied on Graham too much, he still drew double and triple coverages sometimes and Sean Payton would be savvy enough to recognize if/when he's being used as a 3rd down or goal line crutch. People criticize Jimmy for being soft but he's tough as hell; it seemed he spent half his time playing while badly injured and through a lot of pain.  The great offseason purge made sense for some players because of behavior off the field but Jimmy is without a doubt a great guy and positive influence. To me, he's ""the one that got away""."
Saints,3amwrb,ImTonyPerkis,2,Mon Jun 22 20:40:35 2015 UTC,"Unpopular or not, I respect that opinion. We know Graham was great in this system, but we don't know if Unger, Anthony or the receiving corps asked to pick up the slack Graham left will also be great.  Bird in the hand as the saying goes.."
Saints,3amwrb,VegasSaint9,2,Mon Jun 22 20:44:33 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with the trade. I think we got some good value for it, and should have most of the holes plugged up. I do still feel that we are a little light on receiver, until I see our younger players step up. Stills and Graham added up to a lot of receptions, yards, and TDs.  So far, it sounds like we have some potential with the younger receivers, but these no-contact OTAs don't always paint a true picture. I'll reserve judgment until I hear more from training camp/pre-season."

Our Wiki has links for the stadium map that you can take a look at (there really isn't a bad seat). I picked up front row end zone tickets in July for a November game last year for about $400 each. Row 2 was only $275 each. So if you're looking to spend a couple of hundred, you can get some real deals. Ticket Master does tack on a hefty service fee per ticket (FYI).   As for food and entertainment in NO-- it doesn't get any better than local!! Eat as much as you can. There's some great restaurants and places to check out on the Wiki (many spots provided by the great members of this subreddit)."

Go hang out in championship square before! Have fun man.

This is regardless of whether or not it's him in the video; I just find the timing of this to be rather odd.

Saints,3ajbd6,LesBonTempsNOLA,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:39:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, don't know what transpired before the video started filming, but he looks like the aggressor here. He had ample opportunity to leave before he swung the belt. Think he just saw red...needs serious anger management.  I was on the fence about him all year, leaning towards having the saints give him a chance to clean up his act. On the bright side it should be one headcase gone off the team. We've been in serious need of new leaders in the team, gives another guy the opportunity to step up."
Saints,3ajbd6,jfox210,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"He looks like anything but the aggressor here.  An aggressor presses forward. Junior is swatting with a belt and leaning back trying to get people away from him.  He constantly backs up until he's been hit in the face and decides to seek retribution and moves forward swinging to get revenge on that same dude. At this point he's feeling threatened and going to swing at anyone moving in his direction.  I'm not defending his actions, but I WILL always call it straight forward and that's how i see it.   Who knows what she did prior to all this and honestly it doesn't matter, I'm of the opinion he never should have assaulted her and at the same time of the opinion that she's a fucking moron for advancing towards him after his tirade with the belt, he's in a threatened state of mind. I'm also of the opinion that going after people for their past is a very slippery and dangerous slope."
Saints,3ajbd6,ProfoundlyProfound,7,Sat Jun 20 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"Idt he was the aggressor either. But, he keeps putting himself in these stupid fucking situations. He needs to be taught a lesson."

No matter the situation, you are always responsible for your actions. He put himself into a situation where he felt like his only option was to attack a woman with a belt. I've been in some hairy situations, and the thought of attacking a woman has never crossed my mind. I've been in situations where the current legal system would have found doing so would have been justified. Still, the thought never crossed my mind.  A strict lesson is well deserved here."
Saints,3ajbd6,zydecocaine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:30:52 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much how I feel about it. No matter how big of a cunt she was acting like, he didn't need to hit her (even if she deserved it)."
Saints,3ajbd6,Megawatts19,4,Sun Jun 21 03:21:54 2015 UTC,"Forget about the belt, you lose your right to self defense when you leave the fight for some time and then jump back in."
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,0,Sat Jun 20 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"That's just it, he's trying to leave and her dumb ass continues towards him talking shit. She's just at much as fault and just as big an asshole.  Make no mistake, at no time does he leave just to come back at some time later.  His entire interaction takes place in a span of about 1 minute."
Saints,3ajbd6,ProfoundlyProfound,-2,Sat Jun 20 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying she's not a dumbass, but that doesn't excuse the guys action in the video. It's common that both sides are in the wrong when a massive brawl breaks out, and self defense only protects people's actions to a certain point.   If he had enough time to take him belt off and wrap it around his fist, he had enough time to walk away. Self defense only works if you try to diffuse the situation before violence breaks out. There's zero evidence of that."
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,4,Sun Jun 21 02:42:30 2015 UTC,Well you'd be wrong and legally wrong. Anything after initially being struck is self defense. He was struck first as far as the video shows.
Saints,3ajbd6,ProfoundlyProfound,-5,Sun Jun 21 02:54:01 2015 UTC,Actually you're wrong on this and that's not how self defense works at all.   And nice downvote. Way to stick it to me.
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,2,Sun Jun 21 02:57:56 2015 UTC,It's because I'm not wrong. One of us here has a legal background and I'm putting my money on me.

I actually think he looks like the defender here, with the mob attacking. But the way he defends himself is what looks questionable to me. When he hits the woman twice, it looked like she was just trying to talk shit, not hit him.   Now I understand the mentality of when you're getting jumped, you hit everyone in front of you. I've seen friends clock each other in the face during brawls like this because it turns into fight for survival mode. But in the end, you're still responsible for your actions, and that's why Galette needs to avoid these situations no matter what.   All that being said, I'm reserving final judgement for now. All I can say, is it looks pretty damning to me."
Saints,3ajbd6,Hotdog_Skin,2,Sat Jun 20 21:14:55 2015 UTC,"invective can lead to physicality, especially in high-tension situations like this one.

Whatever the incident, from a cheating woman to a petty argument, drunk or not, Junior has some major anger problems and this video proves it. This video, even though it is 2 years old really hurts to morale and the vibe in the locker room. Junior is a great player, but it's to the point where we should look at other options. Sean wants character over talent and I completely agree that Junior's character is constantly being tested. Let's wash our hands from this guy and move on. If someone picks him up, I hope for his sake that he settles down. So much waste for a talent like his to have such a bad character. Sometimes guys like this (thinking about Dez Bryant and Brandon Marshall) just need some time and counseling, but I think it's too late for that."
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,2,Sat Jun 20 20:39:20 2015 UTC,"The punishment should not change if this happened in 2013 or 2015. The crime happened and the severity of the crime hasn't diminished with time.   Treat this like it happened in 2015. If this was a brand new video, would you want Galette suspended the entire year and cut when we could afford to, or give him the minimal punishment and hope he changes?"

I've defended that fucker all offseason because honest to God he hasn't really done anything but piss off fans. He needs to be in jail for this. No way we can cut him, but NFL needs to swoop in, give him the Ray Rice treatment and we need to ship his ass out as soon as the new league year begins."
Saints,3ajbd6,cloud9formations,2,Sat Jun 20 19:48:38 2015 UTC,Junior's lawyer is claiming that this isn't him.

Also, the video starts with the fight already started, so it's he said she said on self defense, and that never hold up. Especially on someone who has a criminal record already."
Saints,3ajbd6,serenity_suppository,5,Sat Jun 20 21:17:20 2015 UTC,was his friend clear of the fight?  what was said between the parties before and during the event?  Were threats issued?  had there been prior physical escalation to reason that further physical contact was being pursued?  Was the situation dissipated when he was a few feet away?  Had the group not been advancing on him UNTIL he began swinging?  Without context....there's nothing there.
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:07:48 2015 UTC,Without context....there's nothing there.   Then why are you so sure it was self defense to the point where you insult people who disagree?

Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:59:57 2015 UTC,"I respect that and I was one of juniors biggest defenders, but even if it was self defense, there is a point were you take it to far, and having a belt wrapped around your fist and whipping women is a little too far in my book.  And regardless, self defense only matters in a criminal court case. If Goodell's past actions have told us anything, it's that NFL image is more important than criminal justice."

Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,-2,Sat Jun 20 21:11:36 2015 UTC,Fighting off aggressors who let him have enough time to take off his belt and wrap it around his hand? No way of knowing at what point in the fight the video started.

Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:00:49 2015 UTC,Yes and that's why self defense is flimsy with this video because you don't know what or where it was escalated. That video only shows Galette's actions and those actions probably won't hold up in a court of law and has no chance of holding up in Goodell's court.

Saints,3ajbd6,duchessofsephora,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying I've been reading the stories for the last day and I just now watched the video. While reading the stories I was pissed and thought they should just let Galette go there is too much drama surrounding him. Then I watched the video... I don't understand what the big deal is. It looked to me like he was being attacked, took off his belt and started swinging. I don't really blame him. I'm a woman and think no man should hit a woman, but those ladies were going at him full force. What the hell did they expect to happen?! You have someone already in fight mode from fighting in a brawl, then you step up and attack. It looked to me like Galette's group was on defense. This isn't even close to a Ray Rice incident IMO."
Saints,3ajbd6,zydecocaine,3,Mon Jun 22 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"Jesus. He needs to never be allowed to wear the black and gold again. The front office needs to make a solid point and hold their players to a higher standard than this pathetic and embarrasing display. If the NFLPA fights for his right to remain on the team with pay, and succeeds, then the Saints FO should take the cap hit and tell this shitstain to stay home. As a fan, I will proudly shoulder the setbacks that come along with losing out on his salary and a wasted roster spot so that the point can be made that these kinds of actions are completely unacceptable."
Saints,3ajbd6,Duff_Beer,3,Sat Jun 20 20:23:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure we literally can't afford to cut him.  It would count against this year's cap.  It would be easier to sign Evan Mathis at this point than to cut JG.  Only way out might be IR due to the pec injury and let him go next offseason.
Saints,3ajbd6,digismack,3,Sat Jun 20 20:28:48 2015 UTC,Is there not a morality clause exemption to these kinds of contract/cap issues?
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,3,Sat Jun 20 20:32:29 2015 UTC,"Nope. Best case is NFL suspends him 16 games so he doesn't get paid, and we can cut him when his dead money drops from 16.2 to 12. 1, and hopefully we can flag him as a June 1 cut to spread the hit over 2 years."
Saints,3ajbd6,Duff_Beer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:44:57 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on the contract, though I'm not sure such clauses are allowed.  Otherwise you'd think teams would protect themselves by including such clauses in all NFL contracts."
Saints,3ajbd6,zydecocaine,2,Sat Jun 20 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'm going to respectfully repeat that I would proudly shoulder whatever setbacks come with having this guy sit our bench (or better yet, sit his couch) on pay until we can get out of his contract. If that means we miss out on $10m to go towards a starting player, then so be it.  I know it is easy for me, a simple fan, to say this. But I would feel an enormous amount of pride in an organization that would make an example out of this. No amount of money, or amount of W's, is worth endorsing a scumbag who resorts to whipping a woman (in any situation), with a belt."
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,5,Sat Jun 20 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"It's not about missing out on $10M, we'd literally have to cut other players or ask players to take a pay cut just to get rid of him. We'd have to punish other players just to get rid of the fucker."
Saints,3ajbd6,zydecocaine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"I don't pretend to know how NFL contracts work, but couldn't we just pay him out the rest of his contract with him on the bench? That wouldn't affect any other players, correct? Sure, we'd miss out on the roster spot along with his salary being locked up on him instead of another player. But can you imagine the message it would send that we would prefer to lose out on all of this instead of having him dress out in Black and Gold?  Some would say that he's not missing out on much- he's still getting paid, after all. But I would imagine any starter-quality athlete would give up the pay to avoid riding the bench.  Edit: This has me riled up. Wanted to add: Deny his chance at glory. Deny his chance at on-field redemption. People are allowed mistakes, but this isn't a mistake. This is indicative to who he is. Over cooking dinner is a mistake. Whipping a woman with a belt can only come from the mind of an abusive dick."
Saints,3ajbd6,Saints2Death,4,Sat Jun 20 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we can pretty much do what Carolina did with Hardy, but hopefully the NFL suspends him like Ray Rice so he doesn't get paid."

He has to find $1.75 BILLION in assets to replace the teams in the trust with, or he's shit out of luck.

Saints,3abn0j,platypuspracticus,0,Sat Jun 20 15:18:20 2015 UTC,It's a bit odd to say that someone is still competent while showing very obvious signs of early dementia.
Saints,3abn0j,Saints2Death,3,Fri Jun 19 16:24:04 2015 UTC,"He's 88. That's not dementia, that's called having 88 years of memories inside your head."
Saints,3abn0j,platypuspracticus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"The psychiatrists involved in his eval said he was having short term memory loss. That isn't just a matter of being old. One of the three said out and out he had severe problems and wasn't competent. One part of early dementia is that it's not an always-on thing. It's short term memory loss and episodes of full on dementia. Given that two out of three didn't see this, it sounds like it fits."
Saints,3abn0j,Charli3q,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"I want to point out that's not me that downvoted you there. I wish there was a way to disable that feature on this sub.  Short-term memory loss is 100% sign of early stages of dementia, but the trouble with diagnosis is that short term memory loss is a symptom of hundreds of other illnesses including long-term alcohol and drug abuse, head injury, PTSD, and a simple sign of aging.   It's the reason why doctors assign memory games like crossword puzzles to patients who show signs of early stages of Alzheimer's because if the memory loss doesn't increase, it means either the cause isn't related to Alzheimer's or that it is Alzheimer's and it's not progressing yet. This is straight from a doctor who is caring for a family member who has suffered from Alzheimer's for over 7 years.  If the only symptom an 88 year old is showing is short-term memory loss, and I'm sure Tom Benson has went through a battery of tests over the past 6 months, then I can't see any doctor claiming it's early stages of dementia."
Saints,3abn0j,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"You seem to be completely throwing out the conclusion of one of the psychiatrists who had said his symptoms were ""moderate to severe"" and said it warranted a ""full interdiction"". The inconsistency in results shouldn't be ignored and could indicate not necessarily a problem with the testing but a problem with the consistency of Tom Benson's facilities which would fit with early stages of dementia.  No worries. I expect to be downvoted. It's an unpopular opinion...just more concerned with the possibility that Tom does have something wrong and everyone is ignoring it for the sake of the team."
Saints,3abn0j,Charli3q,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it is or it isn't dementia or Alzhiemers, but I don't think ""moderate to severe"" short-term memory loss automatically means that diagnosis when no other tests points to dementia.   The only point I'm trying to make is it could be early stages of dementia, or it maybe something else like age.   Also only 1 and 3 doctors reported the memory loss, which could be a sign of intermittence like you pointed out, but the more common explanation would be misdiagnosis.   Our entire disagreement stems from me siding on the side of being conservative (could be wishful thinking) and you siding on the side of being extreme (plan for the worst, hope for the best?). The truth lies somewhere in the middle, which I'm sure well hear more of before the season starts."
Saints,3abn0j,Naly_D,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"All three reported the short term memory loss.   Two of the three described him as suffering from a “sustained mild cognitive impairment,” which affects his short-term memory but does not make him unable to make reasoned decisions. The third psychiatrist, however, described Benson’s impairment as “moderate to severe” and testified that it warranted “full interdiction.”"

Saints,3abx9z,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:14:28 2015 UTC,"Fox didn't exist in the '70s.  When I was growing up, the Cowboys were one of the best teams in football, and had been for over a decade.  The Saints, by contrast, were one of the worst, and had been for over a decade.  And the Cowboys were much closer, so the local affiliates carried the Cowboys.  Wasn't until Jim Mora turned the team around in the late '80s that enough of a clamor arose to start getting the Saints on Shreveport TV with any regularity."

What you say is totally true for the Saints during and after Jim Mora, and I definitely remember significant contention between Dallas fans and Saints fans in Shreveport about which games would be broadcast.

I hope one or two figure out what they're doing before the season starts.. We can't just have two reliable receivers and two ""mediocre"" TEs. We don't need anyone flashy; just a consistent, highly motivated kid who wants to play some dang football. I don't want to just rely on Brees' accuracy when these guys don't know how to run the routes."

Saints,3a8xrk,masterdebater88,22,Thu Jun 18 16:29:32 2015 UTC,I really want to see him with another Superbowl ring before he retires. He deserves it arguably the most.

Saints,3a8xrk,BigMonkeyNewsstand,21,Thu Jun 18 21:40:58 2015 UTC,The one thing the article didnt mention directly( brees hinted at it) is how valuable a guy with this mindset and unselfish attitude is to all the young Wrs on our team. He leaves we have no leadership at this pos.
Saints,3a8xrk,maddlabber829,5,Thu Jun 18 06:01:02 2015 UTC,I think it means a $4.6 million cut from $7 million.
Saints,3a8xrk,fillwitz,12,Thu Jun 18 06:19:34 2015 UTC,"It means he agreed to his salary being cut from 7mill to 3.8mill this year. And another 4.6mill cut from his salary next year. To sum it up, hes not saying ""show me the money"", hes saying ""show me the rings"""
Saints,3a8xrk,maddlabber829,4,Thu Jun 18 06:35:57 2015 UTC,It means he was scheduled to make $7 million in 2015 but agreed to lower that by $3.8 million. Then he was scheduled to make somewhere around $7-8 million in 2016 but decided to lower that by $4.6 million
Saints,3a8xrk,CKitch26,2,Thu Jun 18 07:07:50 2015 UTC,"Which boils down to he was willing to take less this year for a better chance of staying next. As long as he doesn't suffer catastrophic ""Jabari Greer"" injury he will be here next year. Otherwise, no way team would have paid him 7 mil next year, he would have been cut and possibly not resigned."
Saints,3a8xrk,pottersquash,8,Thu Jun 18 08:52:01 2015 UTC,I think I might actually shed one glistening tear the day he retires.

Saints,3a8xrk,SaintsComeMarchingIn,5,Thu Jun 18 11:49:16 2015 UTC,I really hope we keep him until he decides to retire. Like he plays a full season with the mindset of it being his last one and then hangs em up. I hope he doesn't fade out like we have seen with so many veterans. Colston is the man.
Saints,3a8xrk,Iwouldlikealongeruse,7,Thu Jun 18 13:34:41 2015 UTC,I can't believe this will be his 10th season with the Saints. It feels like just a couple of seasons ago he came out of nowhere to be such a consistent guy for the offense.
Saints,3a8xrk,shawnaroo,3,Thu Jun 18 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"I know, right? It's crazy to think that Colston is 32 and Reggie Bush is 30 and they're both pretty close to retirement."

And that, although he had some issues last year, and age is catching up to him, he's the single greatest receiver we've ever had?"

Saints,3a8xrk,Fladohado,-7,Thu Jun 18 12:13:35 2015 UTC,I'm shitty because I think the team would be better off not having Colston as our #2?
Saints,3a8xrk,Dj_Nussdog,8,Thu Jun 18 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"This post wasn't about ""Do you guys think we would be better off with or without Colston this coming season?"" It was about how good of a guy Colston is and how classy he is as a person to understand he had a down year and took a significant pay cut to stay with the team that gave him a chance in this league."
Saints,3a8xrk,Fladohado,-8,Thu Jun 18 15:07:31 2015 UTC,We'd be better off with him not being a starter anymore.
Saints,3a8xrk,Dj_Nussdog,7,Thu Jun 18 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"He had 100 receptions for 902 yards and 5 TD's last season as our #2 WR. Those are solid starting WR numbers.  And who would you want instead of him? Our options would be Nick Toon, Seantavius Jones, Joe Morgan, Josh Morgan, Brandon Coleman, and Jalen Saunders.  Toon: In 3 years, he's had 21 receptions for 283 yards and 1 TD. Hasn't done shit until last year, and still he was average at best.  Jones: UDFA. Never played an NFL game.  Joe Morgan: Had one decent year with 379 yards and 3 TD, was totally insignificant for the other 3. I have high hopes for him, but we cut him for a reason.   Josh Morgan: Mediocre journeyman WR. Should never be more than a #3 or #4. He's basically a slower Meachem.   Coleman: UDFA. Drops the ball a lot. Never played an NFL game.   Saunders: Just a kick returner, probably won't make the roster.  Nick Toon is the only one with a guaranteed roster spot. Like I said, We've got Cooks, Colston, Toon, and then probably two guys who will barely make the team. And I don't mind Toon as a #4, but I'm not all that confident in him as a #3.  Colston is our only WR that has been with the team for a while and has any experience. Colston, Brees, Strief, Evans, and Morstead are the only players on the team with Super Bowl rings. Colston is a veteran leader, an experienced professional, and unlike a lot of other WR's, he's all about the team and he's not a diva."

Saints,3a8xrk,Megawatts19,5,Thu Jun 18 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"So the best was... who? Colston is #1 all time in every receiving category.  Horn? #3 in receptions and yards and #2 in TD's? Better known for his antics than his play? The one that left us and went to the Falcons?  Martin? #2 in receptions and yards, and #4 in TD's? Colston has played the same number of years, and has 1400 more receiving yards, 130 more receptions, and 20 more TD's in 10 fewer games. Martin is definitely #2 in my book, but he doesn't beat Colston."
Saints,3a8xrk,sfzen,-4,Fri Jun 19 15:46:29 2015 UTC,1 Martin. had nothing but bum quarterbacks.
Saints,3a8xrk,Dj_Nussdog,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:53:19 2015 UTC,"He had Bobby Hebert for pretty much his entire career. Hebert is no Brees, but he's probably in our top 5 QB's historically behind Brees, Manning, and Brooks."
Saints,3a8xrk,sfzen,-3,Thu Jun 18 18:12:44 2015 UTC,Bobby Hebert was a bum. Are you serious?
Saints,3a8xrk,Dj_Nussdog,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"He took us to the playoffs 3 times. He went to the pro bowl once. As a starter, he led us to records of 10-2 (in the 15 game strike year 1987), 10-6, 6-7, 12-4, and we were 8-1 when he got hurt in '91. Seeing as we were a perennial loser before 2006, those are pretty good records. He threw for about 3000 yards every full year he played (and was on pace for about 3000 the years he got injured).   If you're comparing every QB to future HoF QB Drew Brees, who holds 4 of the top 7 spots for single-season passing yards and the NFL record for highest single-season completion percentage, then yeah, most QB's in NFL history are bums."
Saints,3a8xrk,sfzen,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:35:55 2015 UTC,Hebert was the quarterback when the team around him was above average.

Saints,3a8xrk,sophandros,10,Thu Jun 18 18:12:09 2015 UTC,"950 yards and 5 TDs is not nothing.  And as the writer pointed out, with Graham gone, he'll probably get more 3rd down (and goal line) opportunities.  He's not as productive as he was, but show me a 10th year WR who is?"

Saints,3a8jyx,didntevenwarmupdho,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"He used to be my favorite player on the team, but then he kinda went all typical WR with an ego mode, only wanting to try when he wanted to. He reminds me of Randy Moss. I'm sure Jimmy never wanted to leave. I remember him saying he's retiring when Brees does because he only wants to play for Brees. Let's see how true that statement pans out. I think it's a bold move, considering we've had one the best OLs allowing the one of the fewest sacks in the past 5 years, to trade one of your best players for another lineman. It was a bold trade, but I really don't care. I think with Brees coming towards retirement and then drafting Grayson for Brees to coach up, the offensive scheme is going to change a little in NOLA. I think we will see a more balanced offense in the following years. I don't think Payton will ever run the offense with Grayson the way he ran it with Brees. I'm not even confident Grayson is our future. I just don't like Quarterbacks that come from small schools. It's a huge change for them in the NFL, playing against real talent."
Saints,3a8jyx,drtro1994,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:15:16 2015 UTC,To be honest I though AJ McCarron would come to us in a trade or something to be groomed at Brees' back-up. I'm not sold on Grayson or Griffin as replacements. Brees has a good 3 seasons left in him. Maybe we get Cordale Jones or one of those Ohio State QB's  when they enter the draft.

Saints,3a69p9,bewareoftraps,9,Wed Jun 17 18:21:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the metrics are also based on catchable balls, not necessarily dropped balls.  And the metric for catchable balls is pretty generous. Doesn't account for the fact that a DB is covering the WR pretty well.  So it could be a combination of a bad read, and a forced throw to make a play (which happened a lot because we were behind in a lot of our games). Or just the WR not being able to get open.   There are also a lot of dropped and incompleted goal line throws that are just generally tough to catch in the first place. Not trying to make excuses for our WR corp, but we didn't really make it easy for them in those cases.   And don't get me wrong, I am still in the mindset that Brees is a better overall passer in terms of mechanics, accuracy, and timing than Brady/Rodgers/Manning. But he makes a lot of bone headed reads.  I still don't think he's on a decline, I think the offense may struggle because we lost one of the best receiving TEs in the game now. But on the other hand, it may improve with a better OL, rushing game, and being even with targets and looks to any receiver not named Graham and Colston."
Saints,3a69p9,dean815,2,Wed Jun 17 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think the offensive strategy will necessitate a reduction of volume in the pass game. I see us (ideally) having fewer total yards, fewer passing yards, fewer receptions, etc. more points, more rushing yards, higher time of possession, etc. It's all about efficiency."
Saints,3a69p9,bewareoftraps,4,Wed Jun 17 18:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think being balanced is the key to what made this team have a hot run in 2009 and 2011. Only difference for why we didn't get to the SB in 11 was the defense couldn't make plays, which saved our ass in 2009. The same heavy blitz scheme was still there, but we weren't able to get a turnover to save our lives. Defense was still pretty poor in both years, but we've made due with that.   That and they key injury to RB, but I think with how good that offense was, it still ran pretty well in comparison to all other offenses in the playoffs.   I think, the offense will be more balanced in the passing game with Graham gone now. Or instead of tunneling on Graham, he might tunnel in on Cooks. So we still may have a problem.   But anyways, at least the OL got beefed up."

Saints,3a69p9,maddlabber829,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:43:57 2015 UTC,"I think anyone watching saints games last year saw an offence that struggled as a unit. Wrs, o-line, rbs, brees, etc. Stats like this can be eye opening to some but to me a bit pointless, doesnt matter whose to blame individually we couldnt win a very winable division as a team.  As a life long fan, i have to adress this and say brees is undoubtly on the decline. Brees his whole career has had role players as opposed to stars on his side of the ball, stats like this are nothing new for him. He would find a that will to win, which i think he is losing. His stats will always be good thats the kind of player he is but the eye test he dont look the same.  With that said, he is still a top 5 qb in the league, and most likely never drop below top ten as long as he plays. To me he is still very much capable of his old self but his arm decision making and pocket awareness is not as good as it was. Not bashing brees but feel like its simple truth he is declining. He imo should be honored as the greatest to put on black and gold and be remembered as a top 10 qb of all time."

Saints,3a3rsi,Saints2Death,6,Wed Jun 17 00:32:04 2015 UTC,Why is it guaranteed? It says in the article he practiced with the team after the incident.
Saints,3a3rsi,VanLupin,3,Wed Jun 17 00:50:32 2015 UTC,"He was already on the bubble.   Brees and Grayson are safe. At most we're carrying 3 QBs, and McCown has something that Griffin and Grayson can't provide the team, experience. Going into training camp I was already expecting Griffin to be cut unless he plays lights out during the Preseason.  50 stitches is pretty significant. It's about 5 or 6 stitches per inch. Conservatively, he had a 6 inch cut on his head. He has a wound that is half a foot long. That's probably going to take a couple months to heal without fear of reopening.  He has been practicing without incident, but he's practicing in gym shorts. A six inch wound is going to take time to heal to the point of reopening. I think he'll be pushing August 13 to be cleared for any chance of contact, and I doubt they'll even risk many red-shirt reps during training camp."
Saints,3a3rsi,Saints2Death,4,Wed Jun 17 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"He already got cut, hence the 50 stitches.  rimshot  Anyway, the incident took place on June 7, and he hasn't missed any practice."

He has no choice to go to practice. If Griffin gives the Saints any excuse to cut him, his career might be over."

Saints,3a3rsi,dean815,2,Wed Jun 17 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"Oh that's not what I'm talking about at all. We have 4 QBs and 3 roster spots. At the best of times Griffin only had an outside chance of making the team because McCown at least has playing experience to provide as both a direct backup to Brees and as someone who can be hands on during Grayson's development while Brees focuses on winning a Super Bowl.   Dude had 50 stitches. He's practicing in gym shorts without incident. How's he going to keep those stitches clean and dry in full pads in July and how long until he's medically clear for contact, because no doctor will allow someone to play football if there's any chance for at least a 6 inch head wound to reopen."

And you can't make a big deal out of the fact that he's playing right now. He has no choice. There's no security in his contract. If he misses work, he's out of a job."

I don't think there is a receiving category that he isn't the franchise leader in.

Saints,3a3s4a,makeplayz,2,Wed Jun 17 01:33:36 2015 UTC,"Understandable. I've always heard this too. I work in customer service. When people raise hell, I laugh. Hell, a lot of people when presented with frustration or confrontation laugh it off, or laugh because the situation is uncomfortable to them. In sports when I fucked up I laughed it off. If you get pissed the frustration lingers. You start trying harder, making you do worse.  I will always defend Aaron Brooks til the day I die. Dude was an athlete. Outside of Deuce and Joe Horn, we had shit. Morons for coaches. McCarthy's play calling was shit in N.O. and Haslett was not a good HC. He was in over his head, despite getting us our first postseason win in franchise history. Outside of that feat, he was bad. Aaron Brooks, had he gone to a good system with a good coaching staff, could've been great. He had all the tools.  I loved him, and I don't fault him for laughing after a pick when the boos rained. What else should he do? Sulk, show negative body language? Or laugh because he knows everyone in that stadium has minimal football knowledge and he shouldn't worry about what they think? I choose the latter. I'd laugh too.  Edit: Also, a lot of Saints fans love to say Brooks didn't care. Go back and watch Week 16 vs Jacksonville, 2013: The miracle lateral play in which Carney missed the following XP that would've sent us to overtime. Aaron Brooks threw the final block 65 yards downfield to spring Pathon into the endzone. He cared.  Edit 2:  The Saints were on their own 25-yard line looking at second down and 10. Quarterback Aaron Brooks passed the ball to the right side of the field to receiver Donté Stallworth, who caught the pass at midfield. Stallworth then bounced off a tackle attempt by Jaguars cornerback Fernando Bryant and turned inside and broke two more tackles. The clock had already reached zero, and Stallworth pitched the ball to the 34-yard line to Michael Lewis who ran the ball to the 25-yard line of Jacksonville. He then turned and pitched the ball to Deuce McAllister, who ran to the Jaguars' 20-yard line. McAllister then pitched the ball to the right side of the field to Jerome Pathon, who caught the ball at the 24-yard line of Jacksonville. Brooks, who had hustled all the way downfield, then laid a block on the last Jaguars defender and Pathon dove into the end-zone."

I think he's a virtual lock because outside of Brees, there's relatively few starters on the 09 team that would even be considered. Vilma and Pierre could make a claim that they are more worthy, possibly Evans, but who else?  Moore? Bush? Harper? Fujita? Porter? Smith?   And I think Colston has the best claim for it since he's the franchise leader in receptions, rec yards, and total and rec TDs. Basically every record that could be owned by either Brees and Colston are owned by Brees and Colston."
Saints,3a3s4a,Saints2Death,2,Thu Jun 18 03:05:41 2015 UTC,"Thats interesting i will gladly debate this, i thought you were a hater that comments on the first sentence without reading the rest.  After brees, colston or jahri no doubt. I could see arguement for both but for debating purpose ill take jahris side.. My case for jahri over colston would be hes been top 3 at his position since entering the league and colston has never really been a top ten. You dont really have stats for guards but he is as consistent as they get.  After these two guys i strongly back pierre thomas. Being asked to do so many things blocking, catching, running, screens. He is great at all these things. The thing i respect the most is his willingness to accept smaller roles and ive never heard him complain and for that matter neither does colston but in fairness to pierre colston has pretty much always been a #1 and he got paid. Might not have eye popping stats but thats cause he did a lil of everything."
Saints,3a3s4a,maddlabber829,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'd rank them Colston, for reasons I already mentioned, Evans, for the reasons you mention, but adding in the less glamorous position. I'm not going to tell my son about the amazing block Evans made, but I can rattle off at least a dozen Colston catches. And then 100% Pierre. He's the second best back in franchise history and the best back already has his jersey retired."

On retired numbers i think archie had 8 r jackson 55, im lil upset i cant remember so 8, 9, 12, 26, 55. Im missing someone just seems theres teams with more sucess and less numbers retired.

Regardless, instead of going through the semantics of who had their number retired, let's just call it ""the highest honor the Saints can give to a player.""  Obviously Brees deserves the top honor, but the 09 is the greatest team in Saints history and we could easily not win another championship in our lifetime. Ask Cleveland. To me, more than one player off that 09 team should have the top honor that the organization can give, and who better than Colston to be the second?   Again, this comes down to Evans or Colston, but honestly I wouldn't be mad if just one or both get it. I just think the greatest team in team history should have more than one all-time franchise greats."

Saints,3a3s4a,sfzen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:27:02 2015 UTC,Agree it's an insane honer. I just think Colston deserves it for helping bring a Super Bowl and holding every franchise record it is possible for him to hold.   What if he plays his entire career here?
Saints,3a3u9q,Saints2Death,17,Wed Jun 17 00:40:49 2015 UTC,I think I'm rooting for SJB more than any other player this preseason. IMO his ceiling is best corner on the team. He's going into his 4th season as a CB and has spend an entire year learning how to play the position without any pressure. This year we'll see how he can handle the pressure.
Saints,3a3u9q,makeplayz,13,Wed Jun 17 00:44:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I hate that so many Saints fans are ready to write him off. Why? He was drafted with intentions of development.
Saints,3a3u9q,VanLupin,13,Wed Jun 17 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"I also have that awful feeling that if we cut him, another team will take a flier on him and he becomes a solid starter."
Saints,3a3u9q,sophandros,9,Wed Jun 17 00:52:12 2015 UTC,me too and that's my biggest fear with the age and injury history of our secondary. How bad would it be if SJB goes to Seattle or NE and starts while Byrd and/or Lewis goes down and Browner starts playing like a 30 year old?
Saints,3a3u9q,Bigheadparker,2,Wed Jun 17 00:57:16 2015 UTC,Also known as the Saints Curse.
Saints,3a3u9q,flordeliest,0,Wed Jun 17 19:55:12 2015 UTC,It's because we drafted him in the second and that he didn't pan out his rookie year   Edit: really? Down votes?
Saints,3a3u9q,makeplayz,3,Wed Jun 17 02:24:14 2015 UTC,Its because Saints fans are so damn dramatic.
Saints,3a3u9q,Bigheadparker,6,Wed Jun 17 07:46:12 2015 UTC,He wasn't supposed to play at all. He was forced to play 38 snaps due to our entire secondary being injured. Saying he didn't pan out is just wrong. We dont know if he panned out. We wont know until he plays regularly. All scouts were saying he has Richard Sherman abilities. Have faith. He was a raw talent with all the physical traits you could ask for.
Saints,3a3u9q,makeplayz,2,Wed Jun 17 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying that most fans think that a second round pick should have more of an impact than he did. Especially looking at who was on the board at that time.   I understand we drafted him as a project, but a lot of people said that the second round was too early to take him because of how raw he is."
Saints,3a3u9q,hryfrcnsnnts,3,Wed Jun 17 03:04:21 2015 UTC,Well there's no doubt second was a reach. But if he turns into a starting CB it'll have been worth it.
Saints,3a3u9q,Natasclothing,2,Wed Jun 17 03:24:52 2015 UTC,Am I the only one hoping that SJB and Breaux end up being our #1 & 2 down the road?
Saints,3a3xsi,VegasSaint9,3,Wed Jun 17 01:10:29 2015 UTC,Williams played 437 snaps last year with the Seattle. I we can get half of that I think it would be worth the signing. If we are really lucky he and Davison will push Bunkley completely out of the rotation.
Saints,3a3xsi,flordeliest,3,Wed Jun 17 09:47:17 2015 UTC,He may have been brought in to take some of Jenkins' snaps. Big John was absolutely manhandled on several occasions last season. Disappointing after a promising rookie campaign.
Saints,3a3xsi,Duff_Beer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:55:08 2015 UTC,"In the end Bunkley didn't do much better, Id rather Jenkins have  gotten those snaps for experience sake."

Saints,3a2f49,samanthakordelski,12,Tue Jun 16 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"Hello Samantha,  I credit the 2006 New Orleans Saints for being the glue that helped the people in the upper gulf region pickup the pieces of the lives with a little dignity after Hurricane Katrina.  I lived uptown and worked in the quarter as a bartender. I would say that I liked the Saints, but I loved the LSU Tigers as most do in and around southern Louisiana.  After Katrina you could see the profound puzzled looks on everyone's face in the city. The ""what do we do now?"" look.  As we went about with rebuilding our lives. The Saints started a new season, we were looking for anything to help us get through Post-Katrina. Living in broken homes, tiny trailers and out of state many had little hope for the future of there beloved city.  Little did we know that what newly acquired coach Sean Payton  and free agent Drew Brees had in store for us.   After that first game in the Super Dome against the Falcons with that most spectacular play by Steve Gleason, how could you not think that out city would rise from disaster. From that day on I am a die hard New Orleans Saints fan. Thank you boys!  As a person that worked on Bourbon Street I could see the change in the city after that game. There was hope and it was the New Orleans Saints! My, how they gave us something to believe in.  Then they went to the playoffs. When they beat the Eagles at home I knew the people in the area affected by Katrina are resilient and the New Orleans Saints do have the best fans in the world.   Thank you for doing this Samantha."

Saints,3a2f49,Megawatts19,5,Tue Jun 23 22:08:50 2015 UTC,"Samantha,  One of the most universal means of enjoying sports is the telling and recounting of stories.   And the amount of joy imparted on the listener, or teller, of any sports story is enhanced by having been there to see it play out--to have ""been there""....  On November 30, 2009, the Saints faced the New England Patriots in a game that had a mostly-unspoken but well-understood meaning beyond that of simply being  a Monday Night Football game between an undefeated upstart and an established football superpower.  After a laundry list of disappointments over the years, we Saints fans were, and to a certain extent still are, conditioned to view any sign of  success on the Saints' part with a healthy amount of paranoia.   As a result, while outwardly we are known exemplify the motto ""We Believe,"" we have a hard time actually doing that.    The result of the Monday Night Football matchup with the Patriots that night represented a crossing of a threshold for many of us.  We were 10-0, and the Patriots 7-3.  The game was at home, in the Superdome.  We were picked to win.  It was a situation ready-made for a let-down New Orleans Saints style.  On the other hand, beating the Patriots meant that we could invest a more hope and emotion into living out the dream of going to, and perhaps even winning, a Superbowl.  The crossing of this threshold from protective doubt to wholesale emotional investment, as represented by the Saints dominance of the Patriots that night inspired me to, of all things, write a poem.   I am not a poet by any means, but for some reason, I felt that only a poem would satisfy my craving to put it all into words.  Its subject, The Hymnwright, is tasked with penning the hymn that embodies the story of the Saints, and his experience, from his perspective, of the events of Dat Mondy Night.  As you may guess, there is more to the poem than what is apparent on the surface.  That is, after all, what poetry is all about, right?   I put it on paper to capture the moment, but to pay tribute as well.  There are many threads that weave into that tribute, and at least one of those threads, the story of the The Hymnwright is a story I definitely think is worth telling.     Here is the poem  A helpful note for interpretation:  The indented and italicized lines are parts of the hymn being written.  The rest is a narrative.  If your interest is piqued, I would be glad to go on when I have a moment to do so.  Probably later this evening.     Edit: some grammar and fixed team records"
Saints,3a2f49,LikeChicken,2,Tue Jun 16 21:57:06 2015 UTC,"This is way late but it's the offseason so sue me.  I'll never forget that night. TV on, pretzels and Popeye's (what else?) and some soda (No drinking during the week). I got a call from my friend in Indiana, he said he was tuning in as well because this was the crux of the situation. Weeks prior the Colts had just beat the Pats with the infamous 4 and 2 call by BB.  What proceeded was probably just elation. You just WATCHED the game unfold piece by piece and the Patriots looked less and less comfrotable playing 'their' game with each down. The Saints went on a roll and I'll never forget afterword the call.  ""Okay, you guys are officially worrying me."" my Indiana friend said, ""Hanging 35 on the Pats is no small feat.""  Like he said above, that's when we started to believe."
Saints,3a2f49,Simsar,2,Mon Jul 6 05:18:16 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the response.  I was beginning to think it was only me that put that much meaning into it.
Saints,3a2f49,LikeChicken,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"Dude, 2009 was probably the bounce back for a lot of people. 2008 the market crash cost my dad his job. I worked full time and went to school full time. The only time I had to enjoy myself was Monday Nights (because I worked Pizza delivery at the time, no way I got Sunday off). I did this for most of college until financial aid and stuff acknowledged my dad was down and out and threw me a friggin bone. I just remember the vindication after the fact though. All the shit I'd dealt with for years was just small potatoes to seeing that game be a legit statement to the Saints and Drew Brees.  Trust me, that game meant a shit ton to a lot of people, it just meant something different to everyone."
Saints,3a2f49,Simsar,5,Mon Jul 6 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"Hurricane Katrina hit in my senior year of high school. I transferred from one of New Orleans biggest schools to the very small town of New Iberia.  I was separated from all of my friends who got displaced elsewhere. It was tough, but my senior year, and my life, would have been different if I moved back home to New Orleans after people could move back. New Orleans had mandatory curfews, no mall, movie theaters, restaurants, high school dances... Nothing. I decided to make the most of a bad situation and enjoy what this little town of anew Iberia had to offer. I lived with my aunt, uncle, and my cousins. One cousin was a Junior on the cheerleader team and informed me that the football team was playing their first game on the day I fully enrolled at her high school. I decided this would be an opportunity to meet some people and forget about what happened in my hometown for a few hours and live a normal high school life. I was watching the game and at halftime, one of the cheerleaders twisted her ankle. She could no longer participate, and the crowd was not into the game much. I decided to slip under the guardrail and grab the injured cheerleader's Pom-poms and started acting like a cheerleader, making up ridiculous dance moves and cheers. The crowd got a kick out of it because everyone on our side knew I was the new kid from New Orleans. The principal was in the stands and saw this and found it great that a kid who was enrolled at a school knowing 1 person for less than 24 hours had more school spirit than anyone in the stands. The following Monday, people came up to me and introduced themselves. I made some lifelong friends from that day, and it was all due to a game of football."
Saints,3a2f49,Briguy_fieri,2,Tue Jun 16 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad you made the best of that horrible situation. I live in Baton Rouge, so I didn't get hit too hard by Katrina, but just days after the storm, we started to get ""refugees"" from New Orleans area. They had such a hard time fitting in. I tried my best to understand and help with the transition, but one of them immediately fell into a life of crime. It was just a sucky situation all around."
Saints,3a2f49,Megawatts19,4,Tue Jun 23 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"So this isn't fully my story, I was in part of it, it's mainly the story of a couple of guys I grew up with.  My best friend was in a car accident with his younger brother years ago. As a result of a spinal injuy, he's now disabled and walks with the aide of armband crutches.  Fast forward to 2005, he and his younger brother were living with his parents in a very nice house along the Biloxi River. He had progress from being completely paralyzed, to a wheelchair.   To the lay the groundwork for his dedication to the Saints, circa 1999-2000 I remember we were watching a game and he was still in his wheelchair at that point. I can't remember what game it was but the Saints had scored a TD and ole Larry was overcome with so much joy he proceeded to jump straight up to his feet with his fist in the air, screaming Yeahhhhhohhhhsh*****t!  His face was one of pure joy and excitement....that quickly turned to shock and amazement as he remembered he wasn't able to actually stand up firmly on his own.....and down he went. We jumped up and went to aid him, only to find him laughing hysterically at the situation.  Fast forward again to 2005. Hurricane Katrina. She took everything. She was cold and uncaring. This was all that was left of that gorgeous house. There was nothing left. Any personal belongings not loaded up in the car that day were now gone. It wasn't that they were just things that were lost....many of them were memories.  Katrina was a nightmare. No power, no water. A neighbor decided to stay, he later regretted it after having to escape the second floor of his home by blasting through the wall with a shotgun and climbing into trees and hanging on for dear life until he and his family were found.  The rest of us, we came back home about 3 days after the storm to find that everything we once knew was now gone. It would never be the same. We were now living out a season of MAS*H . There were Humvees and helicopters....water and MRE food drops, death and destruction....  To tell you the kinda guy Larry he is, the man who lost everything would argue with his ex sister in law about letting me come over to take a shower because our neighborhood hadn't gotten power or water back yet. He'd scream at her in tears about how selfish and miserable a human being she was, and how he'd lost everything, and how other people had nothing, and there she was selfishly throwing a fit about letting a family friend get a shower.  Rebuilding would take years. People would move. Some came back, some didn't. Overall it was a miserable feeling, knowing some friends would never return, some places of business would never return, and wondering whether or not certain areas would ever be recognizable again. But, here's where things begin to take that turn....  New Orleans Saints QB Aaron Brooks would go live on tv and tell viewers if anyone felt they needed something form his home, they were free to help themselves.  In 2006, Steve Gleason would make that legendary block in the opening game against our biggest division rival...the Atlanta Falcons. Complete euphoria wraps the fan base and now we're finally discussing something else over morning coffee other than Katrina. There was something else to focus on other than the rebuilding, the missing things.....  In 2009 the Saints reach the playoffs. Could it possibly be? Is this the year?  We were all gathered at Larry's youngest brother's home. It was time to watch the New Orleans Saints in their first ever Superbowl appearance. It was probably the coldest night of the year, and the birthday of Larry's brother that had been in the car wreck with him. The unthinkable happens....  I knew there was a reason it was so cold that night. Hell had finally frozen over. The Saints won the Superbowl.   Larry dropped to his knees in tears as that timer ran out.....he lost the ability to walk normally or without aid, he lost his home.....but his Saints finally won the Superbowl. Life had dealt him so many low blows. Now, on all days, his brother's birthday life wasn't all that bad, not everything was a miserable memory. There was a silver lining, a positive.    It's now 2015, 10 years later, and many places were never rebuilt. We don't care about that anymore, we just want to watch our Saints on Sunday.  As for Larry? Well....take a look here, here, and here.  It wasn't just the rebirth of a team. It was the birth of coastal cities and of a man.   This team means more to him than they'll every know."

Saints,3a2f49,ohhgod,3,Tue Jun 16 21:33:31 2015 UTC,"I remember going to a game in the mid 90s where they lost. My friend and I had to have been about 9 or 10? at the time and the seats we had were the front row of the upper deck of the superdome, probably around the 30 yd line.  We managed to tear the lids off the dominos pizza boxes and were attempting to throw them on the field. We weren't the only ones and they weren't the only trash on the field.   Those were great seats.  EDIT: This was actually in 1997. I know this because I was playing MTG at the time (5th edition, which came out in 1997) and I wanted to get a booster pack from the mall that used to exist in the Benson Towers. They sold them in the Babbage's there. RIP Babbage's!"
Saints,3a2f49,Glasenator,2,Wed Jun 17 05:12:11 2015 UTC,"Im not from the city of New Orleans nor have I ever been seeing as how i live way up north in Montreal, Quebec Canada. but maybe someday i`ll finally get the chance to see the Saints live in action.  But I guess my football story is the football pool im apart of, the NQP. Its a football pool thats been around for 30 some odd years founded on watching NFL games every Sunday, Monday & Thursday. Not only do we watch these games but 20+ of us every week make our picks for every game played and we receive points based off the result of each game (5 points for getting it right now, 3 points for closest, 2 points for picking the correct winning team) there is a trophy handed out every year to the person with the most points and that`s not the only trophy either. We have different tournaments through out the year such as Fantasy Football, Poker, Darts, Bowling, Golf, Fishing, Pool there is even a Chef of the year, Member of the Year as well as our very own version of the Super Bowl we like to call The Wally Bowl.  To add to all the tournaments we play, we go out and play football (touch football) every Sunday at 12 . We divide the teams based on what each members favorite team is (NFC vs AFC) and play first too 10 touchdowns on a field that is only roughly 50 yards.  The NFC vs AFC as well as division rivalry plays a huge part within our pool, one major rule is that you must own a hat of your favorite team. Say my favorite team (Saints obviously) were to play the Falcons and the Saints beat the Falcons that week. Well then I can go ahead and stomp the hat of anyone whose a Falcons fan.  Usually when I talk to people, or tell them about this pool that I`m in they say it sounds like quiet a commitment and they are probably right. But I enjoy being apart of something that loves a sport as much as I do."
Saints,3a2f49,atn420,2,Sat Jun 20 16:44:16 2015 UTC,"My dad is a rather ""large"" man, to put it nicely. And for some reason his preferred method of watching football games is to lay down on the floor on his back in front of the TV. After a bad play he will roll back to me like a dough rolling pin and comment on it before flipping back over. It's pretty strange and weirds out people when we have guests over to watch games. But hey it's his house, so he can do whatever he wants.  My dad has lived in New Orleans his entire life. He would take the streetcar with his extended family to Saints games back when tickets were only $5. No one ever expected them to win anything so it was really just an excuse to be in the Superdome and head downtown for the day after the game. He never really stopped watching them, but would always poke fun at their ability to throw games.  We started watching the team more religiously after Katrina because it made us feel more connected to the city. Our house got 12 feet of water, and we ended up living in three different states for the next two years.  Saints games became sort of a pseudo news update for us on the city.  But even after Brees started nailing it and things started to look up for us winning playoff games, he was still not a believer of us ever getting to the Superbowl. ""I'll believe it when it happens.""  We finally moved back to our original flooded house in 2007.  It felt different watching the games back on the old floor.  I could tell that he felt differently about our chances of winning even though he tried to hide it.  During the '09 season he was unusually quiet with his jests and jabs. But he was sure that we were going to end up blowing this season somehow, someway. The Saints that ""blew it"" were the Saints that he knew. The night of the NFC championship game against the Vikings involved a lot of rolling on the floor on his part. Every play he was sure something was going to go wrong. ""This is it, we were so close too.""  Right before Hartley kicked the winning field goal I remember him just shaking his head on the floor. Just waiting for it all to go terribly wrong. Everyone else in my family was now standing solemnly around the TV with him on the floor in front of us like a dead fish.  But when that ball went through the posts my dad somehow gained superhuman speed. Before we could even yell in excitement he was already in mid air. In a span of about half a second, around 350 pounds of person had moved from the floor to across the room. Some law of physics had to have broken, no one had ever seen him move that fast before. It was as if he had been laying on a catapult this entire time waiting to be flung. I honestly don't think he even used his hands to get up. When he landed the whole house shook and my brother had to scramble to the TV to keep it from falling off the stand. We all looked at the TV, amazed at everything. I remember looking at my dad who had wide eyes and was now shivering with excitement.  He had no idea what to say."

Saints,3a1oie,ohhgod,3,Tue Jun 16 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"Updates from Tuesday’s minicamp practice:  Attendance, please: Junior Galette, Cyril Lemon and Glenn Foster were not spotted during practice. Wide receivers Marques Colston and Lance Lewis, defensive linemen Akiem Hicks and Brodrick Bunkley were observers. Rookie linebacker Davis Tull worked out off to the side. Safety Kenny Vaccaro left the session early.  Standout on offense: We’ll go a little further down the roster here and give today’s practice ball to undrafted rookie receiver R.J. Harris. He first flashed by stretching out to make a diving catch on a Ryan Griffin throw. He then later made a nice adjustment to make another nice catch.  Standing out on defense: Stephone Anthony continues to look really good playing in space. His instincts seem to put in position to make plays and he’s always around the ball. Cornerback Stanely Jean-Baptiste also had a nice pass breakup on a deep pass intended for Joe Morgan.  Snap out of it: One of the biggest issues today was bad center-quarterback exchanges. Drew Brees and Max Unger had at least two bad snaps and Garrett Grayson failed to pull in another.  Spiller watch: No surprises here, but C.J. Spiller continues to consistently catch the eye. He’s often one of the more dynamic players on the field and made a nice catch in the flat today. He also split out and came out of the slot a handful of times.  Keeping Tabbs: Not a big update here, but Jack Tabb moves better than expected. The undrafted tight end was billed as more of an in-line player, but he moves well and has surprising speed.  Ellerbe: It’s difficult to gauge anyone in the front seven when there isn’t contact, but while we’re talking about players moving well, Dannell Ellerbe deserves mention. He flashed the ability to keep up with tight ends during Tuesday’s practice.  Slot work: Coach Sean Payton said he envisioned Delvin Breaux playing on the outside next season. On Tuesday, he received some work in the slot with the first-team defense. Kyle Wilson also received some snaps with the first team.  Starting defense: Kenny Vaccaro, Jairus Byrd, Brandon Browner, Keenan Lewis, Anthony Spencer, Dannell Ellerbe, David Hawthorne, Bobby Richardson, Kevin Williams, John Jenkins, Cam Jordan.  Second defense: Vinne Sunseri, Rafael Bush, Stanley Jean-Baptiste, Delvin Breaux, Hau’oli Kikaha, Stephone Anthony, Ramon Humber, Kasim Edebali, Bobby Richardson, Tyeler Davison, Kaleb Eulls,  Morstead hangtimes: Times for a handful of Thomas Morstead punts: 4.56 , 4.4, 4.53, 4.53, 4.07, and 4.68 seconds.  Trying out: The Saints had three players trying out. One was wide receiver Matt Jones, a product of Wake Forest. The others were a punter and long snapper.  Brees passing   Complete to Ben Watson Complete to Mark Ingram (would have been a Cam Jordan sack) Complete to C.J. Spiller Complete to Seantavius Jones Incomplete to Tim Hightower (David Hawthorne held) Complete to Josh Morgan Complete to Mark Ingram Incomplete to Brandin Cooks (Rafael Bush pass breakup) Incomplete to Nick Toon (Intercepted by Kyle Wilson) Complete to Joe Morgan Complete to Josh Morgan   Luke McCown passing   Complete to Josh Hill Complete to Josh Hill Incomplete to Joe Morgan Complete to Brandin Cooks Complete to Willie Snead Complete to C.J.

I shared these numbers in a mailbag earlier this offseason. I’m going to share them again.  Slants: 2 targets, 2 receptions, 16 yards Out routes: 7 targets, 5 receptions, 63 yards In routes: 3 targets, 2 receptions, 37 yards Comebacks: 3 targets, 2 receptions, 27 yards Hitches: 5 targets, 4 receptions, 42 yards Go routes: 2 targets, 1 reception, 24 yards Crossing routes: 1 target, 1 reception, 6 yards  Toon can run every route on the tree.

Definitely has the tangibles to play in the league and has made a few good plays here and there but he is more prone to giving up the big play than any other CB we've had recently.  Of CBs who played more than 50% of their team's snaps last year, he was third-worst in the league with a rate of 7.6 cover snaps per reception allowed, per PFF. He has been adequate in a few games in the slot over the past few seasons but still unreliable at best.  A system change could be what he needs to get back on track, as Rob Ryan's system is challenging for many players, and his biggest problem was blown coverage."

Saints,39hnov,dean815,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:50:42 2015 UTC,"It's June and there's not many playoff contending teams with an open guard spot. Either he waits until camp for an injury or he signs a 1-year vet deal, which IMO we are his best fit.   But I want to know why Eagles cut Mathis now and not when free agency started or waiting until training camp competition. There is no reason to cut a player in June except to free up a roster spot, and I can't imagine you get rid of a former starter to free up a roster space."
Saints,39hnov,Saints2Death,7,Fri Jun 12 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"No, they cut him because he was holding out for more money and they didn't want to deal with him. Also, he's an improvement over almost any guard in the league and teams would certainly be willing to cut a player to have him. The Seahawks, Dolphins, Saints, Raiders, Giants, Broncos, 49ers, and most teams in the league would love to have him. Our advantage is that we don't have a lot of money tied up in the guy he would replace. I would love to have him because he is Evan Mathis and is an awesome guy but I think Payton likes Kelemete and Lelito more than people think."
Saints,39hnov,dean815,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:21:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks had no clue that was the reason. I actively avoid Eagles news, because 90% of the time it's just annoying crap that no one outside of Philly should care about (remote control cars, dream teams, racism, ect.), so I've never looked into the reason why Mathis was cut. I thought he was cut because of age and durability, but that was just me assuming.   But I will stand by my statement that it's June and it's well past the time a player can get a multi-year double-digit contract.   Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't think the June market is very good for a 33 year old guard who has only started for 3 season, missed 7 games last year, and was cut by his former team because of the hold out. Yes, a lot of teams could use him, but I can't think of a single time where a big contract was given to a free agent post draft."
Saints,39hnov,Saints2Death,3,Thu Jun 11 23:25:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, recent All Pro players aren't usually on the market in June."

Saints,39hnov,Saints2Death,2,Fri Jun 12 00:28:17 2015 UTC,I think he's got at least one great season in him. He hasn't been a starter his whole career so theres a bit less wear than it might seem. Could be a big deal for the right team. Just don't think the Saints are that team.
Saints,39hnov,dean815,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:32:03 2015 UTC,"Recent All-Pro players aren't usually cut without an arrest and are usually pretty easy to trade as long as you're not asking too much for him.

Saints,39g6bq,pzrapnbeast,6,Thu Jun 11 14:35:37 2015 UTC,"Would hope the Saints look into bringing him in possibly. Could use a third TE, and there are three available now (Wright, Gresham, and Zach Miller) who I think would be good options for them to look at. Miller has been a great blocking TE for Seattle the past few years so he'd be a good pickup as a third TE. Gresham the Saints have already looked at and there would obviously be a fit there as it would give them three solid TEs. Wright I'd be really interested in. Didn't see much of him last year, but in TB I watched him frequently and I think he'd be another great weapon for the Saints offense. You can't replace Jimmy Graham, but Wright would be able to play a similar role as a player who's a blend between a WR and a TE and cause some matchup problems for opposing defenses. Take into account that Brees can elevate the game of those he plays with due to his incredible accuracy and I think Wright could definitely thrive in the Saints offense.

Belichick is a master at finding and developing tight ends. He found or developed career years for Christian Fauria, Daniel Graham, Ben Watson (yes he was a real tight end once), and most recently Gronk and Hernadez. The guy knows tight ends and let Wright go while we could have released 4 other tight ends including Scott Chandler, who is older and costs $2,650,000 against the cap, Fred Davis, who $825,000 against the cap and stays injured, and two guys I never heard of, all making as much if not more than Wright.

Saints,39bs7r,Saints2Death,6,Wed Jun 10 18:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this since the draft. These changes have never been about going from 400 rushes a year to 500 rushes a year. This is about going from 4.5 yards per carry to 5 yards per carry.   Ingram is not going to become this bell cow people are predicting and carry the ball 300 times. Adding Ungar and Peat to our line is about maximizing Ingrams 200 carries, not give him more."
Saints,39bs7r,cloud9formations,2,Wed Jun 10 18:23:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I have also thought the media's narrative of the Saints becoming a running team was overblown. Unger and Peat are just as much about protecting Brees. Trading Jimmy was an attempt to shore up the OL with a proven center and the help out the defense.   You do not pay your QB 20 million for him to just hand off a ball. Brees can make lesser WRs better (see Meacham) and there is replacement level talent on the roster. Graham also made Brees too predictable when he was pressured.  I can see us sustaining a top 15 Running team and top 5 passing. Hell the 09 team was high in both well. Plus Spillers catches will pad Brees' stats.

Spiller is a better runner than those two, but I still think this is about efficiency. I don't expect Spiller to run more than Bush or Sprole, just run better when he asked to do so."
Saints,39bs7r,DarkSquareBishop,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"Going from 25:41 rushes:passes/game of last season to something like 28:38 is not what I would consider a ""drastic"" shift in offensive philosophy, but it would take them from 400 to ~450 rushes on the season. And if they can get 5 yards/carry, why would they not run the ball a few more times/game?  They will still be throwing 35+ times/game, which is plenty of attempts for Drew Brees to be Drew Brees. No one is suggesting turning him into a game manager.  The argument I've made in the past is that even a slight shift towards the direction of a balanced offense would be extremely beneficial to both the running and passing game. I'd be willing to bet that barring injury, Ingram has closer to 300 carries on the season than 200. Either way, I guess we'll see."
Saints,39bs7r,DarkSquareBishop,0,Thu Jun 11 06:45:12 2015 UTC,"What you're proposing has nothing to do with philosophy. You're proposing a 3 carry/pass switch a game, which will fluctuate depending on who has the lead in the fourth quarter.   You're proposing coincidence. Payton is not going to consciously try to run the ball three more times a game."
Saints,39bs7r,DarkSquareBishop,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"At this point, I feel like my point is being lost. Of course it will fluctuate. I'm talking about average ratio of runs to passes over a season tending slightly more towards the rush than it has in the last few seasons due to their personnel strengths. My contention was that that's not some radical shift in philosophy. You keep citing how they're not paying Brees all that money to hand off. I agree, but they also have two running backs in the top ten in salary at the position as well. So yeah, I think Saints will have 450+ rushes this season. That's roughly 50 more than last season, which works out to an average of about 3 more rushes per game. It's not out of the range of what they've done in past seasons, but it is on the high end of the range. That's all. No one is saying they will be a run first team, only that they will run the ball more than they have recently."
Saints,39bs7r,DarkSquareBishop,0,Thu Jun 11 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"This is what I'm saying:  In a close game, you will see no change or balance in how our offense works. We are going to win or loss games because of Brees, not Ingram. If we do go from 400 carries next season to 450 carries, it's because we run 50 more times when we have a lead late in the game, which means those 50 carries are in garbage time and essentially meaningless other than how much time those 50 runs take off the clock.   Plan and simple: If we run the ball on 3-5 times more per game, it means we have a lead late in the game. If we throw the ball 3-5 times more per game, it's because we have a lead. There won't be any change in how we play to get the lead or to fall behind. We're still going to win or lose because of Brees' arm, and that has not diminished one bit since 2006. In 2009 and 2011 we ran the ball more times because Brees gave us the lead. We didn't win 13 games in 09 and 11 because we ran the ball more, we ran the ball more because we won 13 games."
Saints,39bs7r,sophandros,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:09:03 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point. I guess I just disagree that the extra runs will be coming in garbage time. I envision them running the ball slightly more often as a game plan. Not a shift in philosophy, just going with their strengths. If it were up to me, which obviously it isn't, we'd see closer to 480+ carries on the season, but I do think that's a bit of a long shot. I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree, and wait til this season starts to find out. Either way, I'm thoroughly enjoying the discussion. =)"
Saints,39bs7r,sophandros,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:50:08 2015 UTC,"I said basically the same thing in a similar conversation on /r/nfl yesterday and it fits here.  There's a giant misconception of Payton's offense that we throw the ball all over the field because Brees is at the top of attempts every year. That can't be further from the case. If you want to get technical, Payton has one of the most conservative play calling styles, albeit non traditional to the Ground and Pound play calling that people associate with the term ""conservative.""  If you break the Saints passing game down, 90% of the time the receivers run the most efficient routes. We probably lead the league in screens, slants and TE seams. The other 10% of the time we throw it deep to keep teams honest.  Payton can game plan that no matter how many times Brees throws the ball, he's going to complete roughly 70% of his passes and all but 1 or 2 a game will go for at least half a first down. (sometimes a screen pass gets stuffed)  For simple math sake (not realistic at all), lets say Brees throws the ball 100 times a game and completes 70 of them and 68 of the were at least half a first down or more. (every now and then we have screen pass go no where.) Payton can set a baseline when he game plans that 70% of the time he calls a play for Brees, he'll get 5 yards. If Brees completes more than 70% of his passes and/or all those completions go for 5 yards or more, Saints have a better chance of win. If he completes less than that, we have a better chance of losing.   Payton's game plan is to figure out opposing defenses to maximize the chance that Brees does the former not the latter. This is not the case for running the ball, and that's why under Payton, the running game has always been a supplement of the passing game. Run enough to keep teams honest and run well enough to shorten games.   Until we a near that efficient, you'll never see a switch in philosophy under Payton IMO.   Take Ingrams best game last season. Against GB he rushed for 172 yards on 24 carries for over a 7 y/c average. But if you break down his carries:  He had 11 caries over 5 yards 46%, but 6 carries he got less than 2 yards 25%.   So in Ingram's best game last season he was 46% effective, 25% ineffective and 29% average. Remember this is his best game.   Take an average workhorse performance like the first game against Carolina where he ran for 100 yards on 30 carries.   7 carries went for 5 yards or more. (23%)  12 caries went for 2 yards or less and of that 12 carries (40%), 7 carries either got no gain or negative yards (23%).   Right now I think running is just too inconsistent to prioritize it anymore than it already has. Maybe at some point this season we can be as efficient as what i think we all expect, but I still say until the running game doesn't stall the offense's efficiency, I can't see it used any more than to keep defenses honest, short yardage and to run out the clock."
Saints,39bs7r,sophandros,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:10:12 2015 UTC,"You're saying that out of all passes completed by Brees, all but 1 or 2 in a game will go for 5 yards or more? That can't be right. If you want to look at Ingram's average game and say that 40% of his carries went for 2 yards or less, I'd counter with Brees's 40.1% being sacked, throwing an incomplete, or for less than 2 yards in a passing situation. Those numbers are on the season. I get that you're trying to paint a picture of how much more inconsistent the run is than the pass, but the gap simply isn't that wide. I'd like to take a closer look at the numbers when I have more time, because I think you're perspective on it is really interesting. Like I said though, I don't think I'm going to convince you that the Saints should start running the ball a bit more as part of the game plan, so we can just agree to disagree."
Saints,39bs7r,sophandros,2,Fri Jun 12 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'm going by strictly completions, setting a median average of 70% on completions (look at Brees' game log and compare completion % in wins to losses to see why 70% works), incompletions, sacks and interceptions as the other 30%. I'm not denying the inherit risk involved with passing, I just don't think Payton weighs sacks and interceptions as heavily as other teams. It's a risk/reward situation that's been proven successful with Brees since the lowest a Saints offense has ever ranked was 4th and we won a Super Bowl that year.  Payton's system doesn't lend itself to a game manager. You need a gunslinger with the confidence to thread the needle on short slant between a corner and a linebacker on third down (usually it's a pick play). Half the QBs in the league wouldn't attempt Brees go to short yard pass play. Hell, Seahawks lost the Super Bowl on the same play that I swear Brees has a 90% completion rate on.  And don't think of discussions on here, especially with me, as right and wrong or as someone who needs convincing. (Junior Galette and the cap situation not withstanding.) All that ends with is someone calling you an asshole (if i had a nickel.)  I think about it like this, I have an opinion that is a little right and a little wrong, you have an opinion that is a little right and a little wrong. If you present your opinion well enough, I can figure out what right and what wrong with my logic and can use your opinion to strengthen my opinion next time I have the conversation about the subject.   I have a bad reputation on here for being argumentative and a general asshole. But here's a little secret: I'm generally playing devil's advocate so that I can form a well-rounded opinion on a subject, not arguing just because I'm an asshole or troll.   Yes, it usually ends with the other person getting pissy, but to me getting opinions from intelligent and passionate fans is infinitely better than reading tired analysis from ""professionals"" and god forbid terrible bloggers who didn't have the nerve to rise the ranks of beat reporting like every other NFL personality we know that didn't get their name by playing or coaching. It's a bunch of amateurs trying to make a name for them self in a sea of amateurs trying to make a name for them self.   Give me a fan who spent $2,000 on season tickets every year over a blogger in Tennessee that watches games on TV and doesn't do any actual reporting other than sensationalize tweets and reword or provide analysis on someone else's article that actual put in the leg work.   Sure, grammar is usually not correct, the sentence structure is crap, and you encounter a lot of trolls, but the information is SOOOOO much better from someone paying to watch football than trying to get paid because they like to watch football. That's why I like the Around the NFL guys, and it's why they are about the only people I get my news from. They're just passionate football fans that happen to write well and get paid to do it, but there's several hundred guys across reddit just as smart and insightful as those guys, ""They gest dn't right 2 good."""

I moved to the west coast years ago, so I rarely get to talk Saints football with anyone in real life, except during family reunions. So having an engaging conversation about the real details that only true die-hard Saints fans would even care to explore is always welcome.  On this particular discussion, I think we do agree on a lot of the fundamentals, we just disagree on how those things will manifest in a game situation. I'll never downvote or call someone an asshole for giving their reasoned opinion. As I see it, we're all on the same side, and any discussion before the season actually starts just comes from anticipation and excitement about the team we all love.

Saints,39bs7r,MistaChopstix,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"You run more with the lead, so if we are efficient early in the game and play good defense (three and outs, turnovers), we'll get additional carries late in games. Look at 2009. We ran it almost 470 times, mostly because we built big leads and ran more in the fourth quarter. In 2011, we ran about 440 times. Same thing.  Being efficient (~5 ypc as you pointed out) and running more frequently are not mutually exclusive."
Saints,39bs7r,MistaChopstix,0,Thu Jun 11 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"Obviously you run more when you have a lead. That's not a change in philosophy. That's just coincidence.   When I said we aren't going to run more I meant Sean Payton is not going to design a game plan that favors the run over the pass, or even have a game plan that puts more emphasis on the run unless that is a weakness of a defense we're exploiting.   If we run more when we win and less when we lose, that has nothing to do with philosophy or game plan. That's just how football works."

Edit: Originally I was upset with the ruling, but once I saw how DeflateGate played out I realized it was how the team handled the situations. Deflating footballs and artificial crowd noise are very similar illegal advantages and to get such drastically different punishment means something else was factored in. As much as I hate Goodell, there's no way he's negligent enough to punish a team by Win/Loss record, so it had to be because of how forthcoming Blanks was and how closed off Belichick keeps his team."

Yes, winning a championship makes up for a lot of short comings, but Galette has been of best player on the front 7 for the past two seasons. Going 7-9 is not his fault.   Here's the 09 team:  Bush: Had his Heisman taken away for recruiting violations and was dating Kim Kardasian right as the reality star was exploding.   Shockey: Known alcoholic and super dick. So many fights.   Hartley: Suspended for Adderall  Sharper: ...  Gregg Williams: ...  Charles Grant: Indicted on involuntary manslaughter from an incident in Feb of 2008 for being part of a fight where a pregnant woman was killed.  Vilma: How many photos are there with Nevin Shapiro's arm wrapped around him?  Will Smith: Was suspended for PEDs during the Skycaps thing in 2008.

Nothing from them. NFL.com Around the NFL, NBC's PFT, ESPN's GRantland and Sports Illustrated ""MMQB"" write about EVERYTHING that happens this time of year. SportsCenter and NFL Total Access have so many space fillers right now and they aren't reporting it.

Hell in previous years the staff and front office have been a bigger distraction than Galette. Maybe as a fanbase we should back off the guy a little.   Maybe Galette is a dick because in the past year or so the Saints have drafted three pass rushing specialists that play his exact position and the fan base didn't have his back when he was falsely arrested and has his name cleared. Oh and he still has a frivolous mulit-million dollar law suit hanging over his head and an injury he has to deal with that means he'll miss some games.
Saints,395tbv,Saints2Death,3,Tue Jun 9 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"None of those players openly cursed out their coach via social media. None of those player talked shit about the former player that played for and won for their team, and none of those players openly complained about the signing bonus of another team member.   What all of those other players did, which were listed earlier, all came before they were pros or were personal issues outside of football.   Bush got popped for taking money in college. Nothing to do with his professional career, and the woman he dates has no inluence on the team.  Hartley was popped for Adderall after taking it while driving late into the night. If taking adderall makes someone a dick, then 75% of college students are dicks.  Shockey was a known alcoholic but really had a quiet stay here in New Orleans and did what he needed to do in order to win a Super Bowl.  Sharper: I can't defend his actions, but at the time of the Saints superbowl he was a potential Hall of Fame Safety that had no real issues prior to the allegations and eventual conviction for rape.  Will Smith and Deuce were both suspended for taking Starcaps. They also submitted the ingredient list to the NFL for approval and got it. Starcaps had unlisted ingredients in their product which made Smith and Deuce fail the drug test.  Sean Payton was never found to have taken any drugs from the team facility. Funny how that story just went away.   Gregg Williams was burned at the stake to send a message by the NFL. There were several players in the league that said they participated in the exact same type of pay for performance deals on their teams. The Saints were used to be made an example of.  Charles Grant was in a fight and got stabbed iirc. A woman dies and the only person that is responsible happens to be the one NFL player involved in the fight. Funny how he wasn't convicted.  When it came down to business, all of these people did what's best for business in order to win a title.

As for the 09 team, those distractions are way bigger than anything Galette has done.   Dating a reality TV star like Kim Kardasian isn't a distraction? Kim Kardasian is a step down from the stripper that falsely accused Galette in my book.   How do you know Hartley wasn't using them to cheat?  Shockey had a quiet stay in New Orleans because the Saints PR followed him to interviews to keep him from going John Rocker against gays like he did in New York.  Will Smith and Deuce got suspended for Stat Caps. You defend them because they are likable. The fact is, they were suspended is a distraction regardless of motives.   The Sean Payton story went away, but it still was a distraction. Galette's arrest in December went away too, but people still bring it up.   Grant was stabbed in a bar fight. How is that better than anything Galette has done during an offseason?   When it came down to business, all of these people did what's best for business in order to win a title. Gallete seems to be looking out for himself for blasting his coach and complaining about Cam Jordan's signing bonus.

But I'm not saying he's a good guy or not a total dick. I'm saying is he's not a locker room cancer.   Since 2009, this is what locker room cancers look like:   Hernandez arrest for murder. Roethlisberger gets investigated or sexual assault twice in two years in two separate incidents.  Ray Rice punched his wife on video. Adrian Peterson beat his child bloody. Greg Hardy gets arrested for domestic violence and the commish issued a punishment basically saying that Hardy paid the girl to drop the charges.  Johnny Football parties like he's on the jersey shore during the season and goes to rehab right before the NFL draft. Josh Gordon gets suspended a year for failing a drug test, appeals the suspension down to 6 games and then fails another drug test.  Ray McDonald can't stop getting arrested.  Brandon Spikes gets kicked off the Pats after fleeing the scene of a wreck in the middle of the night.  In less than 3 years, Aldon Smith was arrested for DUI, was stabbed, was arrested firearms charges, was arrested again for DUI this time with marijuana, and claimed he had a bomb in an airport... all separate issues.    I'm stopping here not because I ran out of examples, but because I have to stop somewhere because I could do it all day.   Football is full of bad people,. If the following is the worst Galette does, we're in pretty good shape.

Saints,396s0i,brownshugguh,9,Tue Jun 9 17:42:41 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest, he sucks.    He isn't too fast. I think he ran a 4.7 at the combine or pro day, but he doesn't look to play even that fast. His hands are decent out of the back field, but he rarely got open. He doesn't make people miss nor does he run people over. He was a first contact back for us.  He can't pass block well which is odd since he was supposed to play the 3rd down role for us.   All that said, it would not surprise me at all for him to have 1,000 yards or at least one 4 TD game for you next season. Cadet sucks, but if I know anything about football it's that Belichick makes everyone a liar in situations like that.  But a reasonable expectation is being the third string back behind Blount and Gray if he even makes the team. If Cadet makes any impact next year it will be when you least expect it ... like Blount and Gray last season.   Edit: Every team has a couple players every summer whose names seems to be mention every time a coach talks about the position as someone who is ""really impressive."" The player who works really hard in the preseason and has a couple big plays late in preseason games and get hyped by the fans early on but by midseason you forget they are on the team. Cadet was that guy for us."
Saints,396s0i,Saints2Death,2,Tue Jun 9 18:14:19 2015 UTC,"See the problem is that we don't currently have that pass catching back role filled. James White was certainly interesting, but nothing promising.   Gray and Blount were the between the tackle runners, and could also extend plays after getting hit. Though, we do need an elusive back like Vereen and Faulk (I miss Kevin..)."
Saints,396s0i,Saints2Death,3,Tue Jun 9 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"Last year he was supposed to play that role for us, but he couldn't block and he couldn't get open after a chip block, so we abandon that aspect of our game and put Pierre there because at least he could block or catch a screen on third down. To me, this is why it seemed our pass blocking was so bad. Brees didn't have a RB option when he felt pressure.  Brees had LaDainian Tomlinson from 2001-2005, had Reggie Bush from 2006-2010 and Darren Sproles from 2011-2013. Cadet wasn't good enough to pull that role off in our system, but he maybe better in your system. I know how all the moving pieces work in Payton's system because I've seen every Saints game at least twice since he's been here.   From what I can tell the Patriots run a similar system, but other than screens, the Pats use more designed RB passes than the Saints. Most of Brees' completions to Sproles and Bush came off chips blocks of pass rushers and get open in the flats quickly with space in front of them. Cadet just wasn't fast enough, so we replaced him with Spiller. Maybe Cadet will be better in designed passes."

Saints,396s0i,sfzen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"He was great in his first preseason. We already had Pierre, Ingram, Sproles, and Ivory in the backfield, but he played so well the front office made it a point to keep him around. Sadly, he never lived up to that in the regular season or any preseason after that."
Saints,396s0i,sfzen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"what type of back is he?   He's a receiving back. He was a QB in college, so he's not really a traditional runner. He'd be the Vereen role for you guys. I like Cadet and wish him the best, but he's definitely a downgrade for you there in my opinion.   any strengths?   Well... strengths in our offense aren't always strengths in other schemes. Cadet was really just a body for us. He would catch the ball out of the backfield every now and then, rarely run it, and he got some work returning kicks and playing special teams. You could call him versatile, but it's probably not the best word for him. He benefited a lot from our offensive scheme. He was forgotten a lot of the time, so he found himself pretty wide open for most of his plays.   any weaknesses?   Most of what I said above would probably also be his weaknesses. His biggest weakness as a RB is that he isn't great running the ball. He's not as fast as most other receiving backs.    packages he works well in?   I would say shotgun, mostly, but I don't really remember what packages we usually used him in.   how's his blocking?   Meh.  Honestly, I think he'll probably have the same role for the Patriots as he did here. Special teams player, kick returner, 3rd down back in a committee. I wouldn't want him starting, but Belicheck gets a lot out of nobody RB's, so he might surprise everyone."
Saints,396s0i,pottersquash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Great analysis! I love the information from inside of the box you guys are providing.

Saints,396s0i,daybreaker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:43:30 2015 UTC,"We're solid at RB this year. Ingram is finally proving to be our feature back, Spiller should take on the role Sproles had when he was here, and Robinson is a great backup power back. We'll probably carry 4 RB's, so I would guess our 7th round pick Marcus Murphy will get the #4 spot as a return specialist.  Ingram will get the majority of the carries and Spiller will be our receiving back. If Ingram needs a break, Robinson is great as a spell back, and if something happens and Ingram gets hurt, Robinson and Spiller would be a great ""thunder and lightning"" duo."

Saints,392kaq,idkERIK,2,Mon Jun 8 21:08:16 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Saints,392kaq,Jthan254,4,Mon Jun 8 22:09:40 2015 UTC,"It is very plausible. Spiller has the skill set to turn a simple check down pass into a large play. I think Spiller would benefit in a system like ours where he would be one of our weapons and not the ONLY weapon as he was in Buffalo. They also had Fred Jackson, but those two were heavily depended on. I am being cautiously optimistic. I'm ready for these guys to practice with some pads on to see their block shedding ability."
Saints,392kaq,Duff_Beer,3,Mon Jun 8 22:20:04 2015 UTC,Very excited to see what Payton does with Spiller's skillset. I think if his work with Sproles is any indication (and with so many targets having been traded to other teams) Spiller could be in for a big year
Saints,392kaq,MoneyMan_Jones,2,Mon Jun 8 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"I'm excited because it seems last year Payton forced Cooks into that role. We need Cooks running downfield, not catching 10 screens per game. He averaged 10 YPR last season. That's inexcusable for a player with his speed and elusiveness.   Now we once again have the elusive pass catching back that has been a staple in Payton's offense for almost a decade. That should mean big things for the entire offense."

Saints,392kaq,FantasticDucks,2,Wed Jun 10 06:43:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting read. I really like the idea of an x-tra large Sproles in the backfield - Drew could have a lot of fun with that & it would be a blast to watch. I admit I don't know much about CJ's career to date, so looks like it's time to go watch some video. Thanks!"

Saints,391fiy,lossaysswag,0,Tue Jun 9 19:18:15 2015 UTC,Kihkaha is like 15 pounds lighter than Gallette. Kikaha is a OLB but not a DE/OLB hybrid like Gallette. Best chance is Edabali or Tull.
Saints,391fiy,flordeliest,2,Mon Jun 8 23:03:28 2015 UTC,"Kikaha is a natural edge rusher, so is Galette?"
Saints,391fiy,ohhgod,0,Tue Jun 9 00:42:34 2015 UTC,Rushing off the edge is useless if teams are running the ball.
Saints,391fiy,flordeliest,2,Tue Jun 9 00:47:37 2015 UTC,Kikaha is like 15 pounds lighter than Gallette   He is still over 250 pounds. Just because Galette is that big doesn't mean everyone has to be that big to play that role. Kikaha will have his chance to play that role as much as Edabali or Tull.   Edit: Kikaha was listed at 6'2 253 at the combine. http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/profiles/hau%27oli-kikaha?id=2552292 and we know that was full doctor level accurate. Don't know why the Saints roster has him 7 pounds lighter. I wouldn't think he'd lose weight leading into training camp.
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,0,Mon Jun 8 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"Kikaha is 6'3"" 246 and now that I looked it up Tull is also really light at 240.  The weight matters a lot if you are to consistently be stout against tackles in the run game. We all know Galette has has trouble himself at doing that."
Saints,391fiy,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:20:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather go by official combine numbers than numbers put up by an intern on our website.
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,9,Tue Jun 9 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think he actually said it, but if his peers said it that could mean he feels the same. What got me was how much of a rich bitch he sounds like when he mentioned how heavy his gold chain was that it was hurting his neck. I think this contract changed gallete, he's not acting like himself.  Maybe he's trying to inpress his friends. Whatever happened to him, i hope he wakes up."
Saints,391fiy,MistaChopstix,9,Mon Jun 8 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"Immaturity, plain and simple. From the chain comments to the turds he's associating with. I would not be at all surprised if he got his team captain status taken away this year."
Saints,391fiy,baconlovr,4,Mon Jun 8 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't get ""taken away.""  It's voted on every year."
Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,6,Mon Jun 8 17:40:30 2015 UTC,It's all semantics.  I could see how /u/baconlovr sees it that way.  I do.
Saints,391fiy,NewRedditorHere,2,Mon Jun 8 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"So you mean that each captain automatically remains captain every year unless voted out? Meh, I guess I could see that rationale. Doesn't seem as accurate, but I see where you're coming from."
Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,2,Mon Jun 8 18:41:56 2015 UTC,"At this point we don't even know how long he'll be out. I'm sure they'll have another vote. No idea who should be the captain though now that Lofton is gone.  Edit: I'd go with Lewis but it's usually a LB that's captain, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe Stephone Anthony could take over but a rookie captain, doubt it."
Saints,391fiy,Saints4Life_,3,Mon Jun 8 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"I'm skeptical, but it'd be awesome if Anthony becomes a leader the defense rallies around and votes him in.  I really hope Anthony can become a centerpiece for our front 7. We invested a lot in him, so we really need him to be more than just a role-player(which I feel like that's all Lofton was)."
Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"He was the captain at Clemson, so he knows how to lead. Maybe in a couple years.  Gotta disagree about Lofton though, he was one of the best tacklers in the league. He couldn't cover for shit was his main problem. Hawthorne has always been the weakest link in our LB core IMO."
Saints,391fiy,Saints4Life_,2,Mon Jun 8 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"When I call Lofton a role-player, it's not really a slight. I mean that he didn't seem to be very outspoken or inspirational. Now what the hell do I know, I'm not in the locker room. But he just seemed to be the kinda guy that shows up and does his job(well) and that's about it.  I want players like Lewis who openly seemed concerned about the team, or Cam who seems to always be saying something on the sidelines.  Once again, this is all anecdotal and coming from someone outside the locker room, but I just want our front-7 captain to be an outspoken, inspirational character."
Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,3,Mon Jun 8 19:16:07 2015 UTC,"I want players like Lewis who openly seemed concerned about the team, or Cam who seems to always be saying something on the sidelines.   I agree with you 100% there!! Never thought about Cam being captain."
Saints,391fiy,Saints4Life_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:20:01 2015 UTC,"We had both safeties as Captain a few seasons ago with Harper and Jenkins. Doesn't need to be a LB, just someone that is a leader and knows the playbook and what everyone should be doing."
Saints,391fiy,PABLOricardo,2,Wed Jun 10 06:22:53 2015 UTC,That's why I said it's 'semantics'.  It can be interpreted differently.

Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:20:18 2015 UTC,I'd assume they elect captains every year. They probably just tend to vote for the previous captain if he's still on the team and still starting.
Saints,391fiy,sfzen,6,Tue Jun 9 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"Fine him. These are things you get thrown off the team for. It deserves discipline, but the most extreme thing a team can do is throw the player off the team. Ray Rice got thrown off the team. Ritche Incognito got thrown off the team. What Galette did is not even in the same time zone."
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 8 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"He said it himself ""60 or better. 60 guaranteed."" You think a $100,000 fine would do anything? That's going to change him?"
Saints,391fiy,Saints4Life_,-2,Mon Jun 8 19:13:59 2015 UTC,Punishment equals the crime. You shouldn't treat someone selling pot like they committed first degree murder. There is literally no punishment a team can give a player worse than getting rid of him. Do you think this video is worth the Saints Death Penalty?
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:18:31 2015 UTC,"There is literally no punishment a team can give a player worse than getting rid of him.   Why do you think we got rid of Stills? He was late for practice and sometimes smelled of alcohol, sources say. I'd think saying ""Fuck Sean"" when we all know who they are talking about is a lot worse than that."
Saints,391fiy,Saints4Life_,6,Mon Jun 8 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know why we got rid of Stills. Payton and Loomis forgot to ask my opinion.   Maybe we traded Stills because Miami wanted him and we got more from him than his value on the team.  Maybe Stills did something worse and the FO told the ""source"" this not to drop his trade value.   Maybe there was no source and this was just speculation picked up. I mean come on, how much speculation was stirred up this offseason. Why believe this rumor, which is true until the source is named, and not any other ""fire sale"" rumors.   And how do we know this is who they were talking about? Maybe this has nothing to do with football. Was anything else football related mentioned? This was a video about money. That Sean could just as easily been a friend they were joking about or someone they know and they don't like.   Hell, being Haitian is as big a part of his life as being a football player. Maybe that Sean was Sean Penn or Wycliff Jean since Haiti isn't that big and you have two of the most famous people connected to Haiti as probably names said in a third Haitian's video."
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 8 19:34:45 2015 UTC,Maybe Stills didn't want to play in New Orleans?
Saints,391fiy,dean815,0,Mon Jun 8 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"There's another one. Stills was a rookie and had no choice but NO. Maybe he didn't want to play here and decided to play somewhere he likes better to live.   Yes there were moves this offseason to clean out some locker room issues, but that doesn't mean every move was for that."
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,3,Mon Jun 8 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"Lol at people thinking Galette will be cut over a silly video of him and his friends cutting up. News flash: Galette was all up on social media way before the Saints extended him, and if they had any doubts about his work ethic they wouldn't have handed him $10mil cash this off-season. Show me one valid source that shows Galette being anything other than an extremely hard worker and a good teammate. My guess is you can't. My other guess is that Sean and Mickey care a LOT less about social media than most Saints fans do.  Edit: also it's impossible for us to move him at this point as we just gave him 10mil cash which would all become dead money regardless of what we do with him."
Saints,391fiy,krazy9000,2,Tue Jun 9 12:29:10 2015 UTC,I just listened to it on repeat about 10 times... I'm not sure the name Sean is ever said.
Saints,391fiy,krazy9000,2,Tue Jun 9 17:22:18 2015 UTC,I would say trade but that dead money is no joke. If we do trade I think it should be for a first. Galette really has been a pain lately and after the moves made this offseason I don't see Sean putting up with shit anymore after this season
Saints,391fiy,SoUnderrated,6,Mon Jun 8 16:07:45 2015 UTC,There's as 0% chance someone gives us a first for Galette
Saints,391fiy,Bouzal,2,Mon Jun 8 17:36:37 2015 UTC,Maybe a third. That's the highest I could see us getting for him.
Saints,391fiy,Megawatts19,2,Mon Jun 8 18:57:33 2015 UTC,Send him to the Patriots and let Belicheck smack some sense into him.
Saints,391fiy,sfzen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:57:08 2015 UTC,There's a better chance we'd end up paying some of the dead money as part of the deal than us getting anything more than a 4th
Saints,391fiy,dean815,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Question, if he has this surgery and comes back say in October full time. Does he lose any money? Or still get his 2015 salary?"
Saints,391fiy,aimerj,0,Mon Jun 8 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"He doesn't losing any money for being injured. He'd only lose money if he's fined or suspended by the league -- which still can happen over the arrest issue, but it's not likely since everything was dropped before it went to court."
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,0,Mon Jun 8 21:29:42 2015 UTC,I think he's probably reacting to Cam-Jordans contract and think he deserves more. He's shown that he is incredibly immature and not a leader. He will play for us until we can unload him. Right now there is too much dead money.
Saints,391fiy,didntevenwarmupdho,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:33:51 2015 UTC,He already got his massive contract. It sounded more to me like he was complaining about the team using his injury as an excuse to bench him and make him lose out on incentive bonuses or something.

Saints,391fiy,Hotdog_Skin,-5,Mon Jun 8 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"So you want to have a hypothetical conversation about if he had said it?  I would have phrased it ""what would our next course of action be"" to clarify.   But in that case, regardless of his past ""transgressions,"" then yeah, bench/trade him regardless of dead money.  But what purpose does this hypothetical serve?"
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,-6,Mon Jun 8 18:35:27 2015 UTC,"It basically someone coming to a conclusion then building a case against him.   Basically the OP wants you to say kick him off the team so that he and other people can think ""Well his friend saying it is almost as bad, and go along with Galette's history, maybe we should kick him off."""
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,5,Mon Jun 8 18:43:45 2015 UTC,Basically Saints2Death has no idea about the OP or anything related to him despite what he thinks he knows. I'm not looking for validation of my own opinions.  This was more about what sort of value could Galette garner from other teams.
Saints,391fiy,Saints2Death,3,Mon Jun 8 18:50:35 2015 UTC,"What the fuck is all this about punishment? Do we cut or do we trade, and if we trade, what could we hope to get. Bang, simple, done. How are you incapable of understanding?"

Saints,38zmuu,crimes_kid,7,Mon Jun 8 06:07:28 2015 UTC,That would be my guess. Also the fact that he's just an overall toxic person.
Saints,38zmuu,ElmoTheRapist,5,Mon Jun 8 06:43:23 2015 UTC,"imagine that, a piece of shit acting like a piece of shit.  I'm shocked"
Saints,38zmuu,swamptech,7,Mon Jun 8 10:40:04 2015 UTC,"Junior needs to stop acting all gangsta and grow the fuck up. It may not have been him saying ""fuck Sean"", but he's allowing himself to be surrounded by toxic people. All this does is paint him in a bad light to to the organization and the fans. After that whole domestic violence debacle back in January, you think he would have learned his lesson and laid low for a while. I guess not. No matter how good you are on the field, we've all seen how off the field antics have ruined a career. Junior better shape up or his ass will soon be out the door."
Saints,38zmuu,baconlovr,3,Mon Jun 8 14:48:48 2015 UTC,Seems like it was his buddy that said that. But still stupid

Saints,38zmuu,sentientfungus,6,Mon Jun 8 05:04:32 2015 UTC,Yeah. You can see the guy at the very end saying it. It wasn't Junior.

Saints,38zmuu,cheetah_kibbles,3,Mon Jun 8 13:08:10 2015 UTC,"I was right there with you getting downvoted. He should've been traded this off season but I doubt SP could get anything for him higher than a 4th or 5th round.   His record speaks for its self.   12/4/14 – Galette speaks out on his teammates, disrespecting departed veterans 1/5/15 – Galette arrested and booked on charges of domestic abuse battery 1/10/15 – Galette deletes his Twitter account 1/12/15 – Terrance Banks caught with possession of three bags of marijuana in Galette’s car   Edit: Here comes the downvotes.."
Saints,38zmuu,Saints4Life_,4,Mon Jun 8 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"12/4  Galette defends his teammates. Does not say old vets were bad. Says new teammates are better.  1/5 Galette arrested on charges that were dropped. Doesn't matter, fanbase already made up their mind.  1/10 Galette deletes his Twitter account.   1/12 Galette is friends with someone that smokes(sells) weed.   So....what?  You list these things as if it's some case against him that shows he should be cut/traded. But all the things you list are blown out of proportion, taken out of context, or have been rectified. Not to mention, how many other players are just like him, but are better at keeping it private?  The dude has decision making issues, yes. But the ""case"" against him seems pretty flimsy."

Everyone wants to just jump on the ""Fuck Galette"" train, and aren't open to having an open-minded conversation about it.  I mean, maybe Galette is a total piece of shit and is a cancer in the locker room. But I sure don't know whether he is or not, and nobody else on this forum sure as hell knows one way or the other either.   Fuckin Reddit. Why do I even try?"

Just to clear the air since my comment is at the top of the thread, I'm not necessarily saying fuck him. When that shit with the domestic battery stuff came out I was one of the people telling everybody else to chill out until more facts came to the surface. Sure enough, it turns out he really wasn't in the wrong. But I can't shake the feeling that he's a ticking time bomb and it's a matter of time before he does or says something that gets us in deep shit. I don't want that as the greatest QB in our history begins to age and our window of opportunity at another championship with him closes. There's only so many times you can use the ""wrong place; wrong time"" before people, like yours truly, start to question if we'd be better off without him."

I disagree with it, but it's not irrational.   I can appreciate the fatigue we feel having his name in the news often. But he's just too good of a talent to let go based on a series of tedious, but not disruptive incidents. Now, that's my opinion, and I respect that people disagree.  What bothers me, is when we have morons that buy into the ""he coerced the rookies to vote for him"" story without a shred of proof, or the people that think he disrespected his past teammates by saying he thinks his current teammates are better which isn't the same as disrespecting them. Or when people cite his dumb rants on Twitter as to why he's bad for the team.  This sub just seems to want to hate junior, and take any opportunity to do so without rationally thinking through the reasons they're using to justify the hate.  I've said it multiple times: Junior might very well be a piece of shit. But we don't have any proof that it's true other than a video taken out of context, criminal charges that were dropped, and him praising his teammates. I want real proof, not some bullshit article that some shitty website posted to get clicks.  But I'm glad you're one of the more level headed people that didn't jump straight to crucifixion after the stripper scandal.

When you get down to it, Galette has been pretty harmless. The only things he has actually done is tell a reporter that his current teammates are better than the players they replaced and this video where I guess he admits to liking chains and his buddy wants to fuck something that I'm almost certain isn't ""sean."""

He has been nothing but a cancer this off-season, just one distraction after another. We don't need that shit right now and I'm sick of hearing his name in the news cause it's always something negative.

But the reason I'm ""defending"" galette is because everyone is so quick to make snap judgements without considering their sources.  You're illustrating that point with your comment.  You're saying he's a cancer. But there's no proof he is responsible for the decline. He played at a higher level than anyone outside of Lewis.  You're saying he's a distraction. To who? You think his teammates are effected by his outside-the-locker room offseason troubles? You think players are like, ""damn, I wanna workout and study the playbook, but Junior is suffering! I better slack off.""  Look. In the end, maybe Galette is a cancer, and Payton will get rid of him. But to act as if you already know the truth behind the scene based off the bullshit ""sources"" and out of context quotes and antics, is wrong.

Saints,38zmuu,Saints2Death,3,Mon Jun 8 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"Not saying it was the smartest choice, but he's had one of the most frustrating off seasons for someone who didn't commit a crime.   He had his reputation dragged through the mud by a stripper trying to scam him, and although he didn't do anything wrong, public opinion about him can't get any lower.  He spent the offseason having people saying his position (pass rusher) is the Saints biggest need this offseason even though he wasn't injured or traded/cut.   Over the past two seasons the Saints have drafted 3 pass rush specialists (Powell, Kikaha, Tull), picked up a vet Spencer, and have been grooming an UDFA Edebali.  If you look at it from Galette's perspective: The fans don't like him, the media doesn't respect him and the FO is actively trying to replace him if he ever really screws up or gets injured. Throw in the fact that he actually is injured and there's no way he can avoid missing games, the man has a right to be frustrated.  Is this video right? No. But he's one of ours and up until recently Saints fans have always, always, always defended ours unless they sucked on the field."
Saints,38zmuu,jackmuhswag,6,Mon Jun 8 15:59:19 2015 UTC,About time someone said this.  Junior isn't a bad dude.  He just needs to learn social media isn't for him and surround himself with people that wont get him in trouble.  We need to support da beard not trash him.  He's one of the better pash rushers according to pff and people are acting like he's awful.
Saints,38zmuu,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 8 16:08:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Did he do something wrong? Yes, but you don't cut one of your best players because they did something stupid on social media. You fine him, you chew his ass out, and you send him to rehab/surgery to fix his stupid pec. You do a lot of thing. You don't get rid of him."
Saints,38zmuu,baconlovr,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying and I can see the circumstances at which he is frustrated. But at what point does it become his responsibility to conduct himself as a mature adult? The team elected him as a defensive captain, and that comes with certain responsibilities. The stripper incident was indeed unfortunate. The position battle is unfortunate. The injury is unfortunate. But none of these are reason for the behavior he's showing everyone. Coming from a background where he had to work up from nothing, he should know better than anyone that it can be taken away at a moment's notice.  Also, all the incidents that have happened to him were through no fault of his own. This, however, is totally his doing. So while I do sympathize a little with the struggles he's gone through this offseason, I have zero fucks to give about him when he acts like an ass. Being a fan of the team also means knowing when you have an idiot on the roster and cheering for him anyway."
Saints,38zmuu,Saints2Death,2,Mon Jun 8 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but all I'm looking for is people to give him a little more time before we give up on him.   All we are basing our opinions on is the video out of context and a bunch of Saints bloggers trying to get some clicks. Every single one of them put a negative opinion on them in the freaking headline. ""Saints pass rusher Junior Galette speaks out, and not in a good way"" as an example.  If you take the video as it is, it's a grainy video with a bunch of guys trying to get noticed talking about jewelry. We can speculate about other things like was ""60"" means, like 60 Million contract, was the chain he talking about $60,000 or is it some inside joke among friends? We have no clue, but the bloggers have something to gain if they just assume the negative. I mean which link would you click ""Galette goofs off with friends"" or ""Galette bashes team, coach?""  I'm not saying the video is in good taste. Instead of shooting videos, I'd much rather Junior be in a hyperbolic chamber being infused with Adrian Peterson healing DNA. But is this video worthy of Galette being cut and the Saints taking on a bunch of dead money as well as losing the time and money already invested in turning a UDFA into a starter?    Fine him in house. Chew his ass out, and as a very last measure, trade him. But you don't cut one of your best players over a social media screw up."
Saints,38zmuu,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:00:33 2015 UTC,"Fuck.  Here we go again, man. Defending our resident ""cancer.""  I'm so sick of this sub mindlessly following what dickbag bloggers say about a player.   First he gets shit on for defending his teammates, then we bitch about his Twitter antics(which he has deleted btw), then we automatically assume guilt before the evidence comes out(which exonerates him), and now we have some dipshit claiming he said ""fuck Sean""(when he didn't).   I know I'll get downvoted for this, but I'm just so sick of this sub jumping all over his back based on a lack of rational thought surrounding these incidents. A large part of it in my opinion is being so disconnected from the culture he grew up in. A video like this is not stupid or immature within the context of certain cultures. But since most of us haven't grown up in a culture similar to Junior's, it comes off as abrasive. (Myself included here. I didn't grow up in extreme poverty, so idolizing money and jewelry seems stupid to me, but it's hardly unique if you look at your average rap video.)  Ahh, I don't know where I'm going with this rant. I'm just so sick of our fanbase not supporting one of their players. As you said, we've typically supported our own, or at least let the facts come out before passing judgement. But not with Junior."

Because he spent his entire career telling everyone who would listen to him that he was underpaid and always was trying to get more money. A big part of Jackson lore is him going into the GM's office demanding more money to play of a shitty team or be traded or cut and Jim Finks refusing and the Saints went on to having the best season in franchise history.  Because in 1989 he drove his Corvette into the back of a pickup at over 100 mph breaking his face. This happened mid-season two years after Saints had their first winning record in franchise history. He also fathered 9 kids with 5 women, many of which were the result of adultery, and at one time owed more than $150,000 in back child support and was on the State's most wanted list for dead beat dads for years.   This is just off the top of my head and not even about the speculation about steroids, aggression in the locker room and racism towards white players I heard about years after he retired."

Saints,38p2vh,PM_Me_Your_Daughter,2,Fri Jun 5 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe that he has never been selected to the Pro Bowl once. Roddy and him aren't too far apart in stats and White has been 4x. (Not trying to say that White didn't deserve those). White has been in the league for a year longer and has 1118 more yards and 99 more receptions, while Colston actually has 6 more TDs. (Colston has averaged 1025 yards a season, but last season was his second lowest with 902 yards)  I do want to reiterate that I don't think White is overrated, but agreeing with you that Colston is criminally underrated."
Saints,38p2vh,MoneyMan_Jones,2,Sun Jun 7 16:10:55 2015 UTC,"Nah no worries, I agree with you. I think he deserved the Pro Bowl in at LEAST 2007 and 2012. I guess the thing is that people really value stats, which is understandable because not every fan can watch every team to really know and appreciate how good each player is, and I think Colston has been right on the bubble of having the level of stats to put him in the pro bowl a lot. Thing is though, the Saints tend to spread the ball around a lot. In White's pro bowl seasons, he has: 148 targets, 165, 179, and 180. Meanwhile Colston's most targeted season is 143. Give him 20 or 30 more targets or so like many other pro bowl receivers have, and he probably DOES break through to some pro bowls. That's probably my favorite thing about him though, he doesn't complain or call for the ball more. He's definitely been talented enough to be a feature receiver. Mad respect for him."

Saints,38oq8t,dean815,46,Tue Jun 9 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, my response is going to be two parts. First I'll humor the idea that he is in decline and explain that he just went from an all-time great QB to being just a regular great QB, but technically he is in decline. The second part I'll explain the only stat that can be argued that Brees is in decline, and why 2014 was just average Brees.  Ok first, Brees in 2014 was the QB for the No. 1 offense, threw for 4,959 yards and 33 TDs while completing over 69% of his passes. IN DECLINE. ...   Lets put this in perspective:  Yards: In Brees' worst season since 2010, he still threw for the 10th most passing yards in NFL history. In a down year, Brees threw for more yards than Rodgers, Romo, Ryan, Luck, And Rivers ever have in a single season their entire career. The only QBs to ever throw more yards than Brees in 2014 were:  Manning in 2013: The Broncos made the super bowl with the AFC best record.  Brady in 2011: The Patriots made the Super Bowl with the AFC best record.   Marino in 1984: The Dolphins made the Super Bowl with the AFC best record and this was the passing record for 27 years.  Stafford in 2011 and 2012: Neither team was too notable. 2011 made the playoffs and the 2012 Lions had the worst record of anyone of this list.   Big Ben 2014: Tied with Brees for the league leader. The Steelers did win their division.   That's it. Montana, Elway, Favre, Kelley and other HOF greats in their best year never achieved what Brees did in his decline year.   Touchdowns: Brees threw 33 TDs last season. Neither Big Ben nor Eli have ever thrown for 33 TDs or more in a season, and they are both future hall of famers. Matt Ryan and Cam Newton have never thrown for 33+ TDs. Neither have Flacco or Cutler. Phillip River's best year was just 1 TD better and Romo's best season he only three three more TDs. In fact out of the 16 current starting QBs in the NFC, only Rodger (3 times), Romo (twice) and Stafford (once) have ever thrown for 33 or more TDs in a single season. This is Brees 7th time to do it. ... 33 TDs would be a milestone for the majority of QBs in the league right now. For Brees, 33 TDs means he's in decline.   Completion percentage: He also was a hair under 70% passing. You know how many other QBs finished a full season with a completion percentage 69.2% or better? 7 But Brees is the only player in NFL history to do in multiple times (3), and he achieved this on a down year. Also you have to consider Peyton Manning nor Tom Brady are one of those 7.   So TL;DR: Obvious age is a factor. Physically at 36 he isn't the same QB he was in 2011 when he had one of the Top 4 or 5 QB performances in history (Seriously, go look at those stats and tell me he shouldn't have an MVP trophy.) But that doesn't mean he all of a sudden is too old to play football. At 35 years old, he's still a better QB than at any point in Matt Ryan, Eli Manning, Phillip Rivers or Joe Flaccos' career, and the Falcons, Giants, Chargers and Ravens all think their QB is perfectly fine and franchise worthy. One more year won't make him fall off a cliff."

I just wonder because it seems like different QBs need different ""types"" of o-lines. Such as a scrambling QB that needs good tackles, or a pocket QB that needs a solid interior.  It seems like Brees could have all pro tackles but still perform poorly if his guards or center suck. (Which has kinda been the case)"

Overall  Before PFF started assigning numbers to lineman with no explanation other than ""PFF watches a lot of game film,"" the sign of a good offensive line was judged purely on offensive numbers and sacks allowed. Since our offense was No. 1 in yards, No. 9 in scoring and tied for No. 9 in fewest sacks allowed, there’s no argument that the line could be anything but Top 10. But I will do my best breaking down the numbers even further.   Rushing   Team rushing stats go a long way in grading offensive lines, but you should preface these stats with the quality of the running back. When dealing with rushing stats to value linemen, you have to consider how much is it running back, how much is it line play. There’s no scientific way to measure this, but you can say things like this team is Ranked 8th in rushing yards but the running back is great, but that team is ranked 10th, but their running backs suck. That’s not enough to say the 10th Ranked team is better than the 8th ranked team, but you can consider the 10th ranked team’s line is a little better than No. 10 and the 8th ranked line is a little worse than No. 8. Lets use the old standard of 1,000 yard backs for teams who are RB+ and lines that are RB-.   Saints are clearly RB- because no running back on the roster has ever broken 1,000 yard in a season, and the best performance any of them ever had was Ingram last year behind the very line we’re grading. But going into 2014 there was an argument that the Saints had the worst backfield in the NFL. You had Ingram, a perceived first-round bust who couldn’t secure a starting role his first three season and best year was 600 yards and 5 Tds. Behind him you have three former UDFA, two of which’s best stat is “has potential,” and the other one was a 30 year old Screen Pass specialist and pass blocker.   Here are the Saints rushing stats and rankings:  Rushing yards: 1,818 (13th)  Rushing TDs: 16 (Tied for 5th)  Yards per Cary: 4.5 (Tied for 6th)  Now lets consider the running backs on the lines ranked tied or ahead of us: Lynch, Murray, Lacy, Foster, Charles, Forte, McCoy, Bell.   I think it’s a safe bet as a unit, we’re solidly Top 10 with a few votes in the Top 5 all things consider.   Passing  Passing is a little different. Total yards and TDs are completely meaningless because you can put a bad QB behind a good line and they would still get no where close to what a great QB could do behind a bad line. So you have to look at other things.  The only two stats NFL.com gives me are Sacks and Hits. Those two stats alone mean practically nothing because of how much a QB influences things. A good QB naturally takes less sacks because of quicker decision making and release, but could take more hits because of experience and confidence in the pocket to complete passes under pressure. On the flip side, bad QBs can make lines look awful.   We can agree that Brees is a great QB with HOF quickness in release and decision making. We can also agree that Brees throws a bunch of RB screens, is old and slow, and has the confidence to let plays develop – all of which increases the number of QB hits. So lets say the sacks should get a QB++ and the hits should get a QB-.   Here are the stats and rankings:  Sacks: 30 (Tied for 9th)  QB Hits: 81 (17th)  Not good, but these are volume stats, so you have to consider that we pass more than any other team. Both Dallas and the Saints gave up 30 sacks, but you have to consider Brees COMPLETED just 20 less passes than Dallas ATTEMPED. The 183 more times Brees dropped back and didn’t get sacked is not reflected anywhere and means Saints’ 30 is much better than Dallas’ 30.  So we need to look at ratios: Attempts:Sacks and Attempts:QB Hits to get a more accurate ranking of these stats. Since the only team that attempted more passes than the Saints is Indy, I’ll add them in since they are the only team that could jump the Saints in ratio.   Sacks   Broncos: 607, 17 – 35.70 Ravens: 554, 19 – 29.15 Patriots: 609, 26 – 23.4 Colts: 661, 29 – 22.79 Raiders: 629, 28 – 22.46 Saints: 659, 30 – 21.96 Bengals: 503, 23 – 21.87 Cardinals: 568, 28 – 20.28 Texans: 485, 26 – 18.65 Packers: 536, 30 – 17.86 Cowboys: 476, 30 – 15.86 Giants: 607, 30 – 20.23   QB Hits   Broncos: 607, 42 – 14.45 Raiders: 629, 56 – 11.23 Bengals: 503, 48 – 10.48 Ravens: 554, 56 – 9.89 Steelers: 612, 62 – 9.87 Eagles: 621, 64 – 9.70 Cowboys: 476, 53 – 8.98 Packers: 536, 64 – 8.37 Giants: 607, 73 – 8.31 Saints: 659, 81 – 8.13 Panthers: 545, 67 – 8.13 Chargers: 574, 75 – 7.65 49ers: 487, 68 – 7.16 Browns: 502, 78 – 6.43 Chiefs: 493, 78 – 6.32 Texans: 495, 80 – 6.19 Colts: 661, 107 – 6.18   So factoring in attempts, the Saints line is ranked 6 in Sack QB++ (it’s probably closer to 7th or 8th -- almost a full -2 variance) and ranked 10 in QB hits QB- (it’s probably closer to 8th or 9th -- a +.25 variance.)   Those numbers will put them in the argument for Top 10 in passing too.   People will try to make the argument that Brees was pressured more than usual, but the stats don’t back that up. Wouldn’t increased pressure lead to an increase in incompletions? Brees led the league in completions and was less than 1% away from leading the league in completion percentage.   Bottom Line  If the line did play so poorly last season, the PFF eye test as you will, where was the impact? Surely it would show up in the stat sheet somewhere. Yes, it does show in the win-loss record, but what do you think was to blame for that, the No. 1 Offense or the No. 31 Defense?   Other than interceptions, Brees had a stellar year and this isn’t even in the top 3 worst interception years for him. He still completed passes at a ridiculous rate while throwing a ridiculous number of passes with the defense keying on the pass.  There was also no increase in sacks, QB hits and pressures – or at least what pressures should represent in diminishing a QB’s efficiency. The line gave up 7 fewer sacks in 2014 than 2013, and although there is a slight increase in QB hits, it’s hard to say if that was due to the line or the quality of third-down back. In his career, Brees has had LaDainian Tomlinson, Reggie Bush and Darren Sproles. 2014 was the first season he didn’t have a third down RB that could chip a pass rusher and have elite speed to create enough separation in the flat for Brees to throw it.    Also, this is arguably the best year running the ball since Deuce retired, with the stats backing me up, so I’m going to say the switch to zone blocking actually improved the run blocking on our team over previous seasons.   Do I think the 2014 line couldn’t and wasn’t improved? Absolutely not! Goodwin and Lelito visibly struggled which could be the reason people think Evans and Grubbs play went down, but the offensive number not reflect it so something was working."
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,3,Sat Jun 6 06:21:15 2015 UTC,"TL:DR   If the line did struggle, it was not reflected in passing or rushing efficiency. If you consider the amount Saints pass, the sack, pressure and hit numbers aren't that bad. We had our best year running the ball since Deuce retired, yet going into 2014 our roster contained what was considered a first-round bust on a contract year, a 30 year old screen pass specialist and 2 former UDFA's who have ""potential."""
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,2,Sat Jun 6 06:53:18 2015 UTC,"Great write up. You'll have to forgive me if I don't put as much effort into mine lol.  I see where your logical conclusion has come from, but I do find a couple holes in your reasoning that I don't quite follow.    Firstly though, I'll say that I was mostly curious about the passing protection aspect of the line, not so much the rushing.  I agree that the switch to the ZBS has done wonders for our run game. My main disagreement is that we were a top-10 o-line for pass protection which of course is different from an overall top-10.    It seems that a major part of your reasoning is based on:   Since our offense was No. 1 in yards, No. 9 in scoring and tied for No. 9 in fewest sacks allowed, there’s no argument that the line could be anything but Top 10.   I feel that a major part of those stats is attributed to the skill of Brees.  You do address that though, and give Brees his kudos later on, but you still seem to give a lot of that credit to the line, and i'm just not as confident it belongs with them based purely on those stats.    One of the things that the NFL.com stats seem to miss out on is pressures:     The only two stats NFL.com gives me are Sacks and Hits. Those two stats alone mean practically nothing because of how much a QB influences things.   Here again you acknowledge that the QB has a significant impact on those stats. So it just seems too simplistic to assign credit to the o-line when Brees may just be that good while getting pressured.  I guess a lot of pressures end up being hits, so a lot of those pressures are accounted for in the stats, but I still think omitting pressures makes an o-line look better than they are.     TL;DR  I should have specified I was focusing on pass protection.  I think the NFL.com stats don't fully paint the pass protection picture.  I think Brees is more responsible for the positive pass-pro stats than the o-line."
Saints,38oq8t,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Sat Jun 6 08:03:02 2015 UTC,"I think the pass section answers every one of those complaints if you reread it.   The biggest point I was trying to make in passing is if the pass protection was so bad, it would show up in the stat sheet someone. Brees is a great, but he doesn't have super human powers. If Brees was actually getting pressured, hit and sacked more, he should have a dip in efficiency stats. Every QB who ever played drops in efficiency when under pressure. Brees still led the league in pass completions and was less than 1% away from leading the league in competition percentage. If pass protection has zero effect on Brees, why spend any money on it?"
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:51:41 2015 UTC,one of the 10 best lines in the NFL right?   Not for pass protection.
Saints,38oq8t,daybreaker,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:31:26 2015 UTC,I just wrote a detailed reply on another comment that should show you that it was indeed Top 10 in pass protection too.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Saints/comments/38oq8t/were_not_taking_this_as_anything_other_than_pure/crxbg38
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:23:50 2015 UTC,"Well their shifty grades coincide with the fact that Brees has been  sacked more over these last two years than at any time in his tenure here. Even with an elite safety net like Graham. Pressure up the middle is deadly for Drew and he's seen a fuck ton of it recently. So no, this is by far the worst line he has played behind since arriving. #1 offense and all, it's been relatively horrible."
Saints,38oq8t,quantumhed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"That's fine but if the line was that bad it should be reflected somewhere on the stat sheet.   Forget numbers of sacks and hurries and focus on the effect of an increased number of sacks and hurries on a QB's performance. If Brees was getting hurried more, shouldn't he throw the ball away more or force more passes lowering his completion percentage, first downs, and yardage and increase his interceptions?   Why hasn't this fuck ton of pressure up the middle hurt Brees' stats in any way?"
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:30:29 2015 UTC,"The fact that we felt the need to acquire the 2nd best Center in the league and draft the highest rated Tackle in the draft should give my position a little credibility. At the least,  the FO and myself seem to view the line similarly.   Brees did go from scoring 40+ TDs 3-years in row down to 33. Even with the addition of Cooks and a further developed Stills."
Saints,38oq8t,quantumhed,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:30:30 2015 UTC,"so how exactly did the line prevent Brees from throwing as many TDs but didn't affect his accuracy, sack total, yard total and improved the run game? Also 5,000 yards and 40+ TDs are outliers. Brees had to come down as some point.    I never said the line couldn't be improved. We needed a center, so we grabbed the best center we could. And the Peat move was BPA and there needs to be a line around for Grayson. The 2014 line was old. There was only one starter under 30 on the line. Goodwin was old in on a one-year contract. Grubbs and Evans are both over 30 and Strief is over 30. Maybe just maybe the move this offseason was to bring in youth, not because the line played terrible."
Saints,38oq8t,Saints2Death,2,Sat Jun 6 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Second Part  The whole idea that Brees is in decline comes down to exactly one stat: Interceptions. He threw for an insane amount of yards. He completed an insane number of passes for an insane percentage. He also threw a very respectable high number of TDs. (Anything over 30 is a great year even by today's standards.) If you look at Brees' 2014 stats and take away his interceptions, he'd be on the MVP ballot. Brees 17 interceptions is the only negative thing you can say about Brees' 2014 performance.  But guess what, volume throwers throw more interceptions. Brees' decline year 17 interception total isn't Brees' worst year in that stat. It's not even his second worst year or even third worse. Five times in Brees' career did he have 17+ interceptions, and only 1 year out of the 4 years did Brees throw for more yards and more TDs.   Let's break this down even further. Brees has played for the Saints for 9 season. Only 4 of those season did he have fewer than 15 interceptions. The only time in his entire career did he have less than 10 ints was 2004 in San Diego when he had a career low passing attempts (400) in years that he started every meaningful game. 17 interceptions is pretty normal for the guy.   Brees threw 17 ints in 659 attempts. That means roughly that Brees throws an interception every 39 passes, which would me less than 1 per game for most QBs seeing as only 2 QBs last season attempted an average of 39 passes a game.   But does this 39:1 ratio mean he's on a decline? Here's a look at that ratio since 2006:  2006: 50.5:1  2007: 36:1  2008: 37.5:1  2009: 46.5:1  2010: 30:1  2011: 47:1  2012: 35:1  2013: 54:1  2014: 39:1  So 2014 wasn't his best year, but it's about Brees' average throughout his time in New Orleans so it's hard to say he's on decline. To me he just had one his average season.  Now compare this to notable non-rookie QBs from last season:  Andy Dalton: 28:1  Foles: 31:1  Cutler: 31:1  Rivers: 31.5:1  Newton: 37.5:1  Luck: 38.5:1  Brees: 39:1  Peyton: 40:1  Eli: 43:1  Ryan: 45:1  Flacco: 46:1  Kaep: 48:1  Romo: 48.5:1  Tannehill: 49:1  Stafford: 50:1  Brady: 64:1  Wilson 64.5:1  Ben: 67.5:1  Rodgers: 104:1  So basically he is on the low end of interceptions compared to other legit starters, but he wasn't far off league average. The average of these 19 QBs is 47:1, but if you add in all of last years rookies as well crap QBs like they had in NYJ, Buffalo, Cleveland, AZ, St. Louis, Wash, ect., this number will be much closer to Brees' 39:1, but I'm too lazy to do all that math."

Hopefully with the addition of Peat it will start to get better. Look at other QB's the same age or older... Manning now and Montana/Young/Favre/Marino/Elway in the past. Those guys remained productive because of the team around them. No one ever pointed a finger at their ability or old age causing declines unless there was a specific injury causing the hype. Those guys were productive until the day they retired. As a Saints fan I hate giving credit to Dallas but they have focused heavily on the O line and it has been a major reason for their success including against us for the past few years. We need to draft unsexy picks for the next few years. We have loads of talent everywhere but if your star quarterback doesn't have time, you'll be in close games at the end or having to come back down 20 all the time.

If he has a drop off, he'll drop from a top 5 qb to top 10. If we can have a gameplay similar to the Cowboys' last year, with Brees playing similarly to Romo, he could play another 5 years at an elite level.

Jordan was scheduled to count $6.9M against the cap and just signed an extension worth $12M per season over the next 5 season. Just to get his cap number to $6.9M in 2015, the next 4 seasons will increase by $1.275M per season and it's always a progressive increase. If at any point in Jordan's contract does the cap hit reach $15-$20M range, we're in serious trouble. That's elite level pass rusher money. That's JJ Watt money. (most he gets is $17.5)"

Anything other than a 1-year vet minimum (give or take a half million) and I don't want him. That back issue concerns me as well as him being a little bit of a head case and that I think best case scenario I don't think he's enough of an upgrade(if any) over Hill to justify paying him even Owen Daniels money."

My vague dollar sign comment was referring to the precious commenter's remark that he'd been clamoring for the move since early March. Earlier in the process Gresham wanted a huge contract, my thinking is that teams knew he wouldn't be receptive to what they offered until he saw that he wouldn't get that.  In SP's presser today he mentions they've had an eye on Gresham for quote sometime now. I think it was always their intention to bring him in, but not on a big contract. Hence,   $$$"

Saints,38c8sq,smokeajay,2,Wed Jun 3 21:59:13 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty good assumption seeing as we usually keep 4 RBs on the roster, and I don't see Hightower and Baker being so significantly better than Murphy running the ball that it trumps what Murphy can do as a return man. ... Granted this is contingent on Murphy being a better return guy than Saunders and Cooks and that Hightower doesn't become his 2008-2010 self."
Saints,38c8sq,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:00:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And Murphy has a much easier path to a roster spot at RB than Saunders has at WR. Murphy only has to beat out Hightower, Baker, and whatever UDFA's we bring in to camp at RB. At WR, Colston, Cooks, and Toon have pretty much guaranteed spots, and Morgan, Coleman, and Jones are the favorites for the next 2 or 3 spots, plus Josh Morgan and Prater are in play as well. I doubt Saunders beats out two of those 5 for a roster spot.  Plus, Robinson can return kicks, Joe Morgan can return kicks and punts, and like you said, we drafted Murphy as a return man. I do hope Spiller takes Cooks' spot in the return team, though. I don't want to risk Cooks on ST since he's pretty much our #1 WR now, and I'd much rather have Robinson fill in as RB2 than Toon as WR2 if someone gets injured."
Saints,38c8sq,sfzen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think if Saunders makes the team, it will be as a 6th receiver. I think our goal is 4 running backs and 5 receivers.

Still, I just see Murphy having the easier path and being just as good as Saunders. It's not like Saunders was playing at a high level last season."
Saints,38c8sq,Saints2Death,3,Fri Jun 5 16:43:20 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer. Marcus Murphy is a kick/punt return specialist.
Saints,38c8sq,meth_cupcakes_,4,Wed Jun 3 08:55:03 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, Marcus Murphy (our 7th round draft pick) is the most likely candidate for our return man. I can see him competing against Jalen Saunders, the one who made a splash for our return game in the last few games in 2014."
Saints,38c8sq,baconlovr,4,Wed Jun 3 13:58:15 2015 UTC,I sure hope not. He's too valuable in the running game for that. Also Marcus Murphy was drafted for that.
Saints,38c8sq,batmanisfiya,2,Wed Jun 3 15:42:13 2015 UTC,Probably have him and Marcus Murphy back there. But it'll be mostly Murphy I'm sure.
Saints,38c8sq,token711,2,Wed Jun 3 14:02:58 2015 UTC,"Like everything, I think the best player will be returning punts/kicks and right now we have Cooks, Saunders and Murphy returning punts/kicks going into camp. I doubt Spiller is even asked to compete seeing as he's never been more than average when asked to be a returner in Buffalo."
Saints,38c8sq,Saints2Death,2,Wed Jun 3 17:43:38 2015 UTC,I fuckin hope not. He's a bit too fragile for that.
Saints,38c8sq,quantumhed,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:54:57 2015 UTC,I'm very worried about him becoming reggie 2.0 if they do that
Saints,38c8sq,dean815,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"As everyone else said, it will likely be Murphy or Saunders."

Saints,389avr,ohhgod,15,Tue Jun 2 19:04:54 2015 UTC,Sophomore Cooks will blow up the world
Saints,389avr,serenity_suppository,12,Tue Jun 2 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"I love that the only hype he's really getting is, ""Cooks will benefit from Graham and Stills departures.""  They don't realize how good he actually is. They just think he's our only viable option. He's going to light the world on fire. I hope he's spent some time working on TD dances."
Saints,389avr,evtine,4,Wed Jun 3 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"I love Cooks. Other than being a don on the field, he seems like a genuine guy off it, too."
Saints,389avr,DeepWelshVoice,5,Wed Jun 3 15:06:05 2015 UTC,"Cooks was drafted the same year I started watching NFL, and so I thought it right to get his jersey. Obviously stoked that he had such a good year and I'm really excited about what he can do this upcoming season"
Saints,389avr,brentwantscake,2,Wed Jun 3 11:48:25 2015 UTC,"Gotta love Cooks, he was amazing at OSU."
Saints,389avr,mewfahsah,4,Fri Jun 5 03:26:18 2015 UTC,Stills was killing it too.  If only he could have been more cooks like off the field we'd have had a nice duo for years to come.
Saints,389avr,hubristichumor,8,Wed Jun 3 00:44:13 2015 UTC,So over this fictional narrative. There is 0 proof Stills was any kind of a negative player or person in the locker room or outside football. All he did was make plays.   He was traded because he was a commodity the staff felt we could live without and he netted us a decent defensive talent and a good pick. Which went along with the off season mission of getting better on D.
Saints,389avr,VintageWrench,2,Wed Jun 3 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"I mean any time an article mentions a guy was a problem in the locker room you have to take it with a grain of salt.  I never really saw Stills making news for doing things that would be frowned upon by the team.  In fact his facebook page was always him saying pretty inspirational stuff, but again I take it with a grain of salt.  I don't think we can downright say it is fact or fiction.  It is simply something that seems to be floating through the rumor mill.  Though I agree it was a move centered around improving the defense what with adding ellerbe and eventually PJ Williams with the 3rd pick.  I'm just saying that if Stills was as much of a character guy as Cooks is then maybe we would have kept him, and we would have had a great duo at WR.  That isn't to say he was a disruption in the locker room, but just that he isn't viewed as highly as Cooks is."
Saints,389avr,hubristichumor,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:40:45 2015 UTC,"Sean Payton also keeps a vicegrip on locker room intrigue. It's like a vault in there. We don't know concrete information about Vaccaro, Stills, or even Morgan who was suspended and cut before.  Gallette, too. All the intrigue about the campaign to be a defensive captain? No concrete information on that."
Saints,3880ia,baconlovr,15,Tue Jun 2 14:40:44 2015 UTC,Mickey Loomis doesn't give a fuck about you or your cap projections.
Saints,3880ia,pottersquash,14,Tue Jun 2 15:38:36 2015 UTC,"I like locking him up, and if this is what it takes Im for it. However, that is a lot of money. Apparently 33 million guaranteed, 26 of it over the next 2 years. We just got out of cap hell, uncertain how I want to be in it again. Still, I would much rather have him than not"
Saints,3880ia,Bouzal,5,Tue Jun 2 15:01:36 2015 UTC,Methinks one of the reasons for clearing that cap space was to give players like Jordan & Hicks a suitable extension.
Saints,3880ia,asmodeus01,-9,Tue Jun 2 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"Akiem Hicks will get cut before getting extended. He's regressed. He was a nonfactor last year, worse than Cam."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,4,Tue Jun 2 16:14:14 2015 UTC,He was playing on an injured ankle all season. I want to see you push a 300 pound man on an injured ankle.
Saints,3880ia,sophandros,3,Tue Jun 2 20:51:21 2015 UTC,"Hicks and Jordan aren't really to blame.  Our lack of a good NT is to blame.  A good NT can demand double teams on the line affording more opportunities for Jordan and Hicks to collapse the pocket.  Without having a good NT to command those double teams, Hicks and Jordan get double-teamed.  In fact, Akiem Hicks was double teamed on almost EVERY play against the Bears.  Atlanta consistently double-teamed him."
Saints,3880ia,smokeajay,-1,Wed Jun 3 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Dude I wanted Haloti Ngata so bad this off season. I too have been saying that we dont have a good NT. John Jenkins, as I've said before, needs a swift kick to the ass. That dude is huge as fuck and isn't disruptive at all."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,2,Wed Jun 3 01:48:08 2015 UTC,I wish Shelton dropped another spot.
Saints,3880ia,smokeajay,5,Wed Jun 3 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"The entire defense regressed last year, plus who would we have to replace him?"
Saints,3880ia,jackmuhswag,-2,Tue Jun 2 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"Im saying he'd get cut before getting resigned. I didn't say he would get cut. And if he does get resigned without producing first, it'll be very cheap. Keep in mind, in 2013, he was productive, but not on the level of Cam and Junior. Last year he was a ghost. Cam was too, but Hicks was really invisible."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,2,Tue Jun 2 16:32:52 2015 UTC,Yeah if he plays like he did last year i wouldnt mind cutting him. We can replace him for someone who gets better production.
Saints,3880ia,VegasSaint9,-2,Tue Jun 2 16:48:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thinking. I like him a lot and I had high expectations for him in 14, but if he dont do something this year he's gone, he's not getting extended."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,2,Tue Jun 2 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely Jenkins not Hicks. How can a DT get sacks if we are getting ran all over most of the time?2 sacks isn't even  that bad for a 3-4 DE with his type of role. We hardly got to roll out the four man front for passing situations, where we racked up sacks in 2013. When they did rush, the QB usually got ride of the ball to quickly to matter. Lofton, Humbar, White, and Robinson would always let some one open on third down."
Saints,3880ia,flordeliest,-4,Tue Jun 2 22:26:57 2015 UTC,Hicks is a DE. Not a DT.
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:40:18 2015 UTC,Hicks is 324 pounds and is never rarely on the edge. He is a DT.
Saints,3880ia,flordeliest,-1,Tue Jun 2 22:43:54 2015 UTC,"In our base defense, the 3-4, he is a defensive end. In 4 line sets, he plays DT, but he is not a DT.   neworleansaints.com has him listed as DE, as well as every other article I just looked at to make sure I'm not crazy."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:37:46 2015 UTC,You are not crazy but designations like that are mostly BS. He is a DT because of his size and is hardly lined up on the outside.
Saints,3880ia,flordeliest,-2,Tue Jun 2 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"Well, I just went and watched some of his highlights. Every play he was the defensive end in 3-4 sets. So I'll stick with what I think [know]."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:08:21 2015 UTC,I think that Davison guy we drafted will take his spot
Saints,3880ia,jsb93,-10,Tue Jun 2 18:33:42 2015 UTC,Cam had 1 sack last year in the last game of the season I believe. Can't be much more of a non factor than that.
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,6,Tue Jun 2 17:09:04 2015 UTC,?? He had 7.5
Saints,3880ia,Bouzal,-6,Tue Jun 2 17:11:32 2015 UTC,That was the most unmemorable 7.5 sacks I've ever witnessed. I remember 1. He would disappear so often it was like he wasn't even in the game.
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,3,Tue Jun 2 17:16:06 2015 UTC,That just about describes the entire defensive unit
Saints,3880ia,asmodeus01,-1,Tue Jun 2 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"You're correct, but the success of the Defense starts and ends with the push from the d-line and pressure. The only players on defense that were remotely ok last year were Keenan Lewis and Junior Gallette. The rest of the line sucked ass, and Jordan is supposed to be the leader of that line."
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,0,Tue Jun 2 17:31:09 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you man (on this comment lol). Every person that knows shit about football knows that offenses and defenses rely on the trenches for success. On defense it starts with the d-line. Guys cant cover forever. The better your d-line, the better your defense."
Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,3,Wed Jun 3 02:00:53 2015 UTC,You can't sack a quarterback if they're taking the snap and throwing right at Corey White and Robinson in 3 seconds
Saints,3880ia,jsb93,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"That wasn't happening though. Quarterbacks had enough time to wash, dry and fold a load of laundry in the pocket last year. Watch the first game against Atlanta. Matt Ryan had all day to throw. The defense only really showed up against the Panthers the first time they met, against the Packers and against the Steelers."
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"True. Well in the first game, they'd get to Ryan but he'd always get away which is pathetic cause it's fucking matt Ryan. Another problem with the defense is Rob Ryan over complicated his schemes. From what I've heard so far about OTAs, he's going back to a simpler defense so our guys can play full speed like in 2013. Classic case of, ""if it's not broken, don't fix it"" smh"
Saints,3880ia,jsb93,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:53:53 2015 UTC,"Yep,  I read that the 2013 defensive schemes were very dumbed down and simple. Not sure why they tried to complicate things. The quickest way from point a to point b is a straight line."
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,3,Tue Jun 2 19:02:15 2015 UTC,He was going to get around 7 mil this year so also take that into consideration.
Saints,3880ia,cloud9formations,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:12:33 2015 UTC,"About $100,000 between him and Junior. Let's see them earn it."
Saints,3880ia,AmazonBrainforest,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:13:27 2015 UTC,But isn't this different? Isn't his contract front loaded instead of back loaded like we've been known to do?
Saints,3880ia,Megawatts19,4,Fri Jun 5 17:19:22 2015 UTC,"I love the extension; he had a down year last year, but so did the defense as a whole."
Saints,3880ia,asmodeus01,4,Tue Jun 2 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"Cameron Jordan is the model player for this football team after Drew leaves. He's incredibly smart, positive-minded, and outspoken. He was our best defensive player in 2013 and he can get back there if the secondary can give him a little more time to get to the passer."
Saints,3880ia,dean815,3,Tue Jun 2 17:50:11 2015 UTC,and yet people will tell you that its Cams fault that the secondary couldn't live up to expectations cause the Dline struggled getting to opposing quarterbacks.
Saints,3880ia,ohhgod,7,Tue Jun 2 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Little from column A, little from column B. I will say that I am of the opinion it was more from the fact that outside Westbank our fucking secondary was a wet paper towel."
Saints,3880ia,The_Don12,3,Tue Jun 2 18:54:39 2015 UTC,it goes both ways. It also doesn't help his case that the only other person who had more than three sacks was Junior
Saints,3880ia,dean815,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:58:55 2015 UTC,"I agree wholly with this. Even if he didn't live up to a superstar contract last year, guy is a classy member of the community."

Saints,3880ia,makeplayz,2,Tue Jun 2 14:52:57 2015 UTC,I still think there were some underlying issues with both Graham and Stills in terms of off-field/locker room conduct that prompted their departure. But maybe I'm just reading too much into it.
Saints,3880ia,VegasSaint9,5,Tue Jun 2 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"Stills, yes, Graham, I doubt it. We couldn't afford him if we wanted to solidify our roster."
Saints,3880ia,dean815,6,Tue Jun 2 16:15:06 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Stills answered this question and said he never had one issue on or off the field in Nola, off the record or on record."
Saints,3880ia,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Jun 2 16:36:59 2015 UTC,I've still never heard it from Payton or Brees for that matter
Saints,3880ia,jacksandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:30:07 2015 UTC,He was mysteriously hurt for a large number games though. I remember they'd have him scratched from the lineup when I never heard anything about him getting nicked up or anything similar. It always struck me as odd.
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,2,Tue Jun 2 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"can you elaborate??? I've heard this a bunch but nothing more than vague comments, I know stills might have been a diva but I still thought he was pretty popular"
Saints,3880ia,cfiggis,-1,Tue Jun 2 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"For Graham, I heard it was something about locker room conduct after a loss, but I think that was just a rumor. For Stills, I heard that he would be showing up late to meetings smelling of alcohol. Nothing concrete, though."
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,5,Tue Jun 2 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Take this for what it's worth, but members of the New Orleans media have stated that Graham would sort of sneak into the locker room after losses, hurry up and shower/get dressed and kind of hide/steer clear of the media after losses. Heard it from 2 different media guys on the radio a month or two after he was traded."
Saints,3880ia,dean815,3,Tue Jun 2 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Even if that's true, what would that have to do with getting traded?"
Saints,3880ia,nola_mike,0,Tue Jun 2 17:16:48 2015 UTC,I believe that speaks volumes to his character. JMO though.
Saints,3880ia,israelearthcancer,3,Tue Jun 2 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"I can't say I agree, at least based on the limited info available. If he was just an outright douchebag after a loss that's one thing, but I wouldn't trade a guy because he doesn't want to talk to reporters. I think trading Graham was the FO trying to get rid of what they were starting to think was a bad contract."
Saints,3880ia,jacksandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"There were other things mentioned by these media members that I can't quite recall at the moment. All things pointed to him having a me first attitude, and not really caring about the team succeeding. This falls in line with him and Stills being traded. Wanting all of the spotlight and not caring about the team as a whole."
Saints,3880ia,dean815,0,Tue Jun 2 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"He fucked them around during the off-season last year with all that wr/te bullshit, they probably planned his departure right then. Then the bitch ass injuries sealed the deal. Now he's the seahawks problem."

Saints,389zqh,Saints2Death,5,Tue Jun 2 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"Kind of misleading, but still a cool number. Ryan is great when he has an o-line (although I think I could be a decent throwing to those receivers), and I think Cam isn't the greatest QB, but he's a game changer for sure. All that matters though is that ring Drew has that they don't."
Saints,389zqh,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Jun 2 21:29:06 2015 UTC,how is this misleading?
Saints,389zqh,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Jun 2 21:30:44 2015 UTC,"Well, misleading is the wrong word. Cam is going to make the most money ever in the first 3 years of a contract, and Brees will make more than Ryan over the next 2 years of his contract. So the breakdown of who will make the most money over the next 2 years of their respective contracts would go:  Cam Brees  Ryan  You're right though. You're info is exactly what's stated in the title, so it's not misleading per se."
Saints,389zqh,sophandros,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the structure of the deal can vary drastically. But average salary and even guaranteed money, both Newton and Ryan are better paid.   Brees' situation just shows that backloading a contract to squeeze out a couple of championships before numbers start to get crazy is a terrible idea. Granted, we were hamstrung the year Brees signed that contract by Bounty punishments."
Saints,389zqh,VegasSaint9,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:57:22 2015 UTC,When Drew signed his deal I said he would look like a bargain in a few years because of the new market value for QBs.
Saints,389zqh,daybreaker,2,Wed Jun 3 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been a bargain with the way the contract was structured. Brees might be under these guys in average, but Brees' cap number over the next two years will be higher than the highest cap hit of Ryan or Newton."

Saints,388e1q,Saints2Death,3,Wed Jun 3 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"I guess good news is no one has been hurt, but I'd love to hear something of substance out of DBs and Receivers. The oline competition won't really happen till real camp starts, but there should be a roster shake down at those two positions as well as a little clarity on who is inline for WR 3, 4 and Nickel and Dime corners during OTAs."
Saints,388e1q,Saints2Death,3,Wed Jun 3 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm interested to see where Andrus Peat will be placed. Payton specifically said he'd be playing Tackle, but almost every roster projection I've seen has him in a Guard spot."
Saints,388e1q,AGQ-,4,Wed Jun 3 18:05:35 2015 UTC,"I said from the moment we drafted Peat that it's going to be the best 5 guys period. It doesn't matter what position they played last year, their entire career or where someone was drafted to play. If you are the best two guards and not one of the best two tackles, you're playing guard.   This excites me because I don't think we've had a fully cohesive line since 2011 when Nicks left. Since then we've let people walk and added pieces as needed instead of building the best line out of the roster you have."

Saints,38ab34,Megawatts19,5,Wed Jun 3 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"Is Cam Newton an elite? No, at least not yet but with enough time I think he can be. Is he a mediocre QB? Fuck no."

Saints,38ab34,Frohirrim,0,Wed Jun 3 21:52:52 2015 UTC,So what word or words would you use to describe his four-year career so far?
Saints,38ab34,xbaited,2,Wed Jun 3 16:42:36 2015 UTC,I would say he has had a pretty good start to his career.
Saints,38ab34,wigginsix,0,Wed Jun 3 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Cam Newton is good enough to build a team around. That about sums it up.   Look around the league. There are half a dozen teams that would line up to pay him bank.   The simple fact is you can't get elite QB's anymore because there just aren't any. There are none, (zero, zip, nada) coming through the College system.   These days if you find yourself a decent reliable starter that you can build a team around then your only option is to go all in on that guy.   Is Newton an amazing passer? Hell no. Can he continue to win games in a division that doesn't stink it up? That remains to be seen.   Is he the best they're going to get right now? Without a shadow of a doubt. Can they build a team around him? Absolutely.  It doesn't take a genius to realise that in 5 years there aren't going to be any of the current elite QBs left. Right now only 3 teams have young QBs that have been proven to be worth a damn - Luck, Wilson and Newton.  Wilson's decent, but he's not elite. Luck could be an elite if they can get a decent group of starters around him and Cam sure as heck ain't elite.   In 5 years Rogers is gonna be on his last legs which means that unless some new elite QBs come out of nowhere ""good enough"" is going to become the new elite.   Look at the teams with elite QBs right now and we see Garapolo is untested in New England, Denver has nothing, Green Bay has nothing, we've got jack (except for a great prospect) and whoever Big Ben plays for now is up the same creek without a paddle.   Unless something happens Cam ""good enough to get a $100 million contract"" Newton could be dominating the league in a few years.  Worst part about that possible eventuality will be having to listen to every Panthers fan talk about how good he is in /r/NFL. Ugh."

Saints,37zf29,sfzen,3,Sun May 31 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Why would we want Mathis, of all people? Let's go with pros and cons.  PROS   He's probably a safer option than Lelito at OG.   CONS   He's got a big contract. So much of what we've done this offseason has been clearing out the big contracts. He was in serious danger of being cut this offseason by the Eagles, mostly due to that contract. I'm 90% certain that the dead money they would be stuck with is the only reason they didn't cut him.  It's pretty clear that he's been on the trade block for some time. No one has made a move for him. He's not exactly a hot commodity. If we did trade for him, a 2nd or 3rd round pick would be way too much. We only got a 5th in return for Grubbs, who wasn't much worse and cost less. He's 33. He's not getting any younger. We need to get younger on the OL. Armstead is a great piece to build on, but Evans turns 32 before the season starts, Unger is 29 and injury-prone, and Strief will be turning 32 when the season starts. Adding Mathis to that list would mean Armstead is the only guy on the upswing of his career. That's why we drafted Peat. Both tackle spots sorted, time to move inside with it. Lelito did a pretty good job as a backup OG in 2013. That's the whole reason he got the chance to earn the starting C job (and ended up starting most of the season when Goodwin was hurt) last year. He showed a lot of promise, and he looks to fare better at his natural position with better players around him. Armstead is only getting better, and Unger playing on his right at C is better than Evans was last year on his right at RG. He's also just turning 26, so if he does well, that's another OL spot we won't have to replace in the next 2-3 years. Mathis was one of the best guards in the league 2 years ago. He's not anymore. He's declining. Even if he comes in and wins the starting job now, we can't assume that he'll be starting quality next season. We don't need another question mark."
Saints,37zf29,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:48:42 2015 UTC,don't know what were could trade for him 2nd and or 3rd rounder for him?   What? He is 33 and has zero trade value.  The Eagles are the only other team with a line older than ours.
Saints,37zf29,flordeliest,-1,Sun May 31 22:29:34 2015 UTC,"It's a guard position, not a running back. And why does it matter how old anything on our team is? If you dont believe once Drew leaves, that we are in a world of hurt, (max 3 years from now) then you are kidding yourself. It it won't matter what positions are set, look at the Texans, Bills, Jets, really good defenses, pieces of offense yet no playoffs. And those are horrible divisions, our division is full of franchise qbs, we are fucked for the future unless we trade for a qb or Colorado state qb plays amazing. So I'm not saying we should over value Mathis like the Raiders would, but using the fact that he's old and just about done as a defense to not getting him is pointless, we would need like 1-3 years from him for this superbowl run, that's it, which is exactly what he should have left."

The series is by far the oldest and most established rivalry in the division. Born one year apart, the Saints and Falcons were the first two NFL franchises in the Deep South (Washington and Dallas being arguably southern but not in the ""traditional"" Deep South). They have shared some important players, such as kicker Morten Andersen (the leading scorer in both franchises' histories), Bobby Hebert (who quarterbacked for both teams in the 1990s), and Joe Horn (the Pro Bowl Saints receiver who left for the Falcons in 2007). They have also drawn coaches from the same families, and even shared a head coach: recent Falcons coach Jim L. Mora is the son of longtime Saints coach Jim E. Mora, and former Falcons and Saints coach Wade Phillips is the son of former Saints coach Bum Phillips.

Swilling and Jackson coming off the edges was beautiful to watch. I wanted to cry when Rickey went to SF but was happy he got a Ring. Swilling to Detroit pissed me off too but Turnbull came on and did OK."

Saints,37roia,jffm114,5,Fri May 29 21:07:22 2015 UTC,I see Morgan at 3 and hope Coleman makes 4. But I can see none of the WR's stepping up and Toon being the fourth.
Saints,37roia,maxpowers33,1 point,Fri May 29 21:26:50 2015 UTC,Why would Toon be behind Morgan?
Saints,37roia,flordeliest,2,Sun May 31 00:44:05 2015 UTC,not really behind. they play different spots.
Saints,37roia,subcriminalmessages,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:24:33 2015 UTC,Seemed that way in the past. Toon just hasn't shown me anything that says he's ready to step up. I'd love to be proved wrong.
Saints,37roia,maxpowers33,0,Sun May 31 01:29:14 2015 UTC,Morgan is purely a deep threat and hasn't been anywhere near good since he tore his meniscus and partial tore his ACL.  The one who moved up after Cooks went down was Toon not Morgan.
Saints,37roia,flordeliest,2,Sun May 31 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"Toon right now is WR3 and Morgan is WR4, but neither of those are set in stone. I see Jones, Coleman, and Prater really pushing those two. ... If Coleman learned to catch over the past year, we might have a serious weapon.   Edit: I'm saying Toon is WR3 because he took over for Cooks for the rest of the season when Cooks went down in week 11. I think that gives him the leg up heading into the preseason."
Saints,37roia,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 29 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say Stills took over not Toon, he only really moved up during the Steelers game where we didn't have Graham.  I also doubt Prater makes the team."
Saints,37roia,flordeliest,1 point,Sun May 31 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Morgan at 3, not sure of 4 though."

Saints,37roia,aimerj,1 point,Fri May 29 21:59:23 2015 UTC,It's spelled Seantavius. The lack of o in the end surprised me too.
Saints,37roia,flordeliest,1 point,Sun May 31 00:45:48 2015 UTC,"Toon 3rd, Coleman 4th"
Saints,37roia,aimerj,1 point,Fri May 29 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"I think the ""starting"" three WRs will be Colston and Toon on the outside with Cooks playing out of the slot. With some combination of Morgan, Jones, and Toon in at the 4 whenever its needed.  Coleman will sub for Colston  Jones will sub for Toon  Morgan will sub for Cooks  There are some caveats:  Morgan will have to seroiusly work on his short/intermediate routes and prove that he has matured since last year.  Toon must show hes more consistent and can fight through coverage to make catches.  Jones and Coleman are question marks because there isnt any game film of them against NFL defenders."
Saints,37roia,Stokest26,1 point,Fri May 29 23:07:12 2015 UTC,I cannot see Cooks reduced to slot duty.
Saints,37roia,quantumhed,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:48:02 2015 UTC,I think Toon is slotted in at the 3 until he shows that he simply isn't quite good enough - I reckon Cooks becomes the clear cut #1 and is moved all over the field.   I'd ideally like Seantavious Jones at the 3 and Morgan at the 4 with Coleman coming in for the Graham seam routes/red zone packages.
Saints,37roia,didntevenwarmupdho,1 point,Fri May 29 23:18:14 2015 UTC,"Realistically, I think Toon and Morgan are the frontrunners for the 3 and 4 spots. Toon did decently last year, and Morgan was a huge home-run threat a couple years back (something like 10 catches for over 300 yards and 3 TD's).  Ideally (and I mean blind, unrealistic optimism), I'd really like for Coleman to break out and win the #3 spot. At 6'6"", if he can perform well enough to win a starting spot, he would pretty much be our new Graham. I hope Morgan can earn a spot in the top 4, since his speed is such a great asset. If they can all perform, Cooks, Colston, Coleman, Morgan, Toon, and Jones are a balanced, diverse receiving corps."
Saints,37roia,sfzen,1 point,Sat May 30 06:28:37 2015 UTC,"All I know is that our speed is back, and I thinks that's our key on offence with brees accuracy"
Saints,37roia,bennibobiboo,1 point,Sun May 31 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"Toon and Morgan have those spots.   I'd put Toon ahead because he already stepped up last year on the road in Pittsburgh, when we don't have Cooks and Graham.  Also Morgan was just kicked of the team.  If Coleman and Jones look good they could easily leap frog anyone but Cooks."
Saints,37q7li,baconlovr,14,Fri May 29 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"It's a fucking shame that Sharper is the scumbag that he is because I seriously admired his career as a defensive back.   9 interceptions in that Superbowl season, 376 return yards, 1 interception returned for 99 yards and a TD the longest in Saints history.  A real shame a guy with his level of talent and history is such a piece of shit."

Saints,37nni7,Jthan254,10,Thu May 28 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"After last season, I am hesitant to say that our defense will turn around. It may be just media words spoken in this article, but I am hoping there is some truth behind some of the things Browner and Vaccaro are saying. It seems they becoming one cohesive unit.   I like Vaccaro's quote the best ""I think we mesh together really well. It's different when you're Playing alongside your teammates and when you're playing with your best friends"". Maybe it is hindsight, but I feel as if our secondary was lacking this type of brotherly chemistry last season. Old faces were gone and new faces were added. Here's to hoping this chemistry and communication can translate on the field to create a formidable secondary."
Saints,37nni7,jsb93,7,Thu May 28 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"I've heard someone say, I think it was Rob Ryan, that the ""individual"" shit is gone and it's back to being a team. I had bad vibes from the secondary last season from the moment I found out Corey White wouldn't give Champ Bailey his #24. Then week 1 came around and him & P. Rob looked lost and got abused by the falcunts and it just continued all season. Browner should definitely get our defense to a respected level again"
Saints,37nni7,SaintsComeMarchingIn,3,Fri May 29 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"I follow Jimmy Graham on social media (along with Kam Chancellor) and the Seahawks are always on vacation together and bonding. I think that's great, especially for a secondary! As seen in high school football all the time, when you're really close  with your teammates you can have an idea of what they'll do in certain situations on the football field. It helps you react better and play better as a team."
Saints,37nni7,Stokest26,3,Fri May 29 02:25:32 2015 UTC,"Jsb - I must have missed that article, but I agree with everything you said after. I didn't put much thought into Corey White not giving up his number, but little things like that could've been a little red flag.   Saints- You hit the nail on the head. A close relationship among teammates helps with those predicted situations. The player is almost able to play based purely on instincts. A secondary that can communicate is huge. The whole vacation with all of the Seattle players is also pretty neat. I have to admit that Pete Carroll created one hell of an environment there."
Saints,37nni7,Megawatts19,5,Fri May 29 02:58:39 2015 UTC,I'm taking all positive news regarding the defense with big grains of salts this year...I've been hurt before.
Saints,37nni7,ohhgod,3,Fri May 29 04:44:33 2015 UTC,Me too. I would rather be pessimistic and proven wrong than optimistic and proven wrong.
Saints,37nni7,Todo88,3,Fri May 29 14:50:15 2015 UTC,Last years secondary expectations really had me all kinds of messed up.  Heading into this year i have absolutely 0 expectations when it comes to the defense.
Saints,37nni7,ohhgod,3,Fri May 29 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"We really miss Browner in Seattle. Dude is a stud, OG of the Legion of Boom. I hope he has a good season (sans Superbowl for the 3rd year in a row) in New Orleans. I think he'll pan out well for the Saints."
Saints,37nni7,ElmoTheRapist,6,Fri May 29 06:07:10 2015 UTC,"I remember watching a small interview with the LOB where Sherm, Earl & Kam all said Browner is the one who really helped bring them together.  I'm hoping he can do the same with Lewis, Byrd & Vacarro"

Saints,37nni7,pottersquash,2,Fri May 29 12:00:36 2015 UTC,"Browner is such a beast. Him and Revis were a perfect match. If you guys want to see what he does best, do yourself a favor and watch the Butler interception. That play does not get made without big bad Browner jamming the receiver.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7rPIg7ZNQ8 And enjoy those salty Seahawks tears"
Saints,37nni7,Hedgery,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"Its rather telling the physical differences btw Him and Lewis. Like Lewis looked like ""the man"" in last years group of corners. Just looked more physically up to the job. Brandon makes Lewis look like a highschooler. No wonder everyone keeps abusing our CBs in one on ones, they are tiny!"
Saints,37nni7,pottersquash,2,Fri May 29 15:11:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I wouldn't consider Lewis as someone who got abused. He played well, and played injured most of the year. Other corners, yeah they got abused, but even though Lewis got beat at times, saying that compared to Browner he looks like a high schooler is a bit much."
Saints,37nni7,Hedgery,3,Fri May 29 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Oh of course. Lewis is the fucking man. I am just saying I am shocked by the sheer physical difference.
Saints,37nfj6,xspinkickx,14,Thu May 28 22:38:26 2015 UTC,"This may explain why his technique on tackles was so poor. It looked like he was completely incapable of wrapping up and bringing guys down, so he went for hits to knock them off balance."
Saints,37nfj6,jlongc,11,Fri May 29 00:57:44 2015 UTC,Yea. Dude was our best tackler in 2013. I knew something was up
Saints,37nfj6,jsb93,5,Fri May 29 01:03:22 2015 UTC,I am hoping he bounces back to his 2013 self.

Saints,37nfj6,flordeliest,1 point,Fri May 29 17:10:48 2015 UTC,I am trying to figure out what happened to our pass rush last year.  I think that at the end of the day exacerbated the problems in the secondary.

Saints,37nfj6,psquared85,6,Fri May 29 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"He had one hell of a Sophomore Slump. If the injury was to blame then I sure hope fully healed.

I don't know how it works, but I'm sure it's painful."

Optimistically: a player realizing there was a year learning curve that he accepted and is making steps to help the team he plays for. It helps that bush is out there vouching for him as well.

Saints,37ma9y,SaintsComeMarchingIn,6,Thu May 28 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"Not a Saints fan, but I think it's ridiculous that people, especially on /r/nfl , don't consider Brees on par with Rodgers, Brady, and Manning"
Saints,37ma9y,snaxsnax,4,Thu May 28 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"As a Saints fan, it doesn't bother me.   Barring injury, Manning will have every career passing record at the end of the season to go with his single season TD record, yard record and 14 pro bowls, 10 All Pros (7 first team), 5 MVPs and 3 OPOTY.   Brady has won 4 Super Bowls, been to 10 pro bowls, 3 all-pros, 2 MVPs, 2 OPOTY, on top of being arguably the best post season QB of all time.   Brees' resume just doesn't compare with those two and they are his peer. Rodgers is the best QB in the NFL right now and that's why people put him ahead of Brees, but career wise Rodgers will align more with Brees than Manning and Brady. It's hard to believe, but people really underestimate what Brady and Manning have accomplished.   Edit: It's like Karl Malone, Magic Johnson, and Scottie Pippen all deserves to be mentioned with the greatest NBA players of all time, but they don't have a strong argument since they played during the era of Michael Jordan. Brees is definitely one of the greatest QBs of all time, but he played during the time of two Jordans."
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,7,Thu May 28 22:54:36 2015 UTC,"I find it severely disappointing, in how true it is, that a great QB can be pushed to the side in conversation because of the faults of the rest of the team. I would love for us to get back and win one more SB while Brees is here. He deserves it, not only for his hard work, but to secure his legacy better. Because I want people to remember him more than an afterthought in the GOAT conversations."
Saints,37ma9y,GenrlWashington,6,Thu May 28 18:02:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like Drew deserves it more than any other QB in the league right now. But I really don't see rings as a factor in the GOAT discussion. We're specifically talking about the skill of the QB and how they were able to change games with their play and hold records or have astounding seasons. Drew and Manning embody that, especially in the passing category. I would take both of them in their prime, then Rodgers, then Brady.   To put it in another perspective, imagine if Brees had the defense of the Seahawks. 4000+ yards a year and the LOB? Or anything close to it? Give the Saints a top 5 defense and you have a legacy like the Steel Curtain era. A team that consistently wins. I seriously think the only reason people put Drew behind Brady and Manning is because of the number of losses the Saints have had because of defense. I love our team and I love our players. And bias is a huge part of this statement, but I consider Brees in the top three QBs of all time. Just because of his actual skill to throw the ball, his sincerely modest personality, the way he changed the way people look at an entire city/state and his football intelligence. That's all purely my opinion. He's the main reason I became a Saint."
Saints,37ma9y,GenrlWashington,2,Thu May 28 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not against anything you said. What I'm talking about is GOAT discussions in general that I overhear. There's always one thing or another that people use as an excuse to leave him out. I have no doubt in my mind he is definitely worthy of discussion, but other people think differently, and I think another ring would probably secure his spot on those outside conversations."
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,2,Thu May 28 20:45:52 2015 UTC,Very true!
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,3,Fri May 29 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"He deserves mention, but he doesn't have a strong argument. He's not even the best of his era, Manning and Brady are. Unless he does something to surpass those two before he retires (a little John Elway finish) then I don't see anyone outside the fanbase putting him that high."
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu May 28 20:38:33 2015 UTC,"Again, I attribute Brady's success to the great coaching of the team, along with the many skilled players on the Pats' roster. Yeah we have Payton, but the Patriots have had Beli for quite along time and have been pretty consistent with keeping skilled players for all 4 of their SB appearances. They really are a great organization and I give that more credit for Brady's success than his skill.   I put Manning and Brees up above Brady just because of pure QB skill. Of course, I respect all 4 of the top elites in the league right now."
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,3,Fri May 29 02:13:46 2015 UTC,Brady is a great QB who also has great coaching. That argument is insane.
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 29 02:23:13 2015 UTC,"I never said Brady didn't have great coaching? I also never said he wasn't a great quarterback. I just attribute his 4 rings to a great all-around team and coaching. And I attribute his GOAT hype to this past SB win. If the Pats would have lost, he'd probably be considered 3rd-4th best QB in the league right now."
Saints,37ma9y,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 29 02:32:31 2015 UTC,"And if my Aunt had a dick she'd be my Uncle. There's no way to prove what people would think if the Pats lost. There's no way to prove how many rings he would have won with a different coach and a different team. Hell, prove that he couldn't have won 6 or 7 rings if he played on another team. You can't."
Saints,37ma9y,Where_is_Wallace,1 point,Fri May 29 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"I can't prove anything like that, and I think you know that. But we're also both Saints fans, so you don't have to be a pompous asshole in every thread, to anyone who disagrees with you. I'm stating my opinion.   Brees has played better (%s for each game) and has had more passing yards the past 5 seasons than Brady. This is with less talent around him. I'm not talking SuperBowls, just to reiterate. I'm talking about QB performance. And Brees has done more with less."
Saints,37ma9y,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 29 02:47:57 2015 UTC,you go around calling people assholes and I'm in the wrong? How am I an asshole for stating my opinion but you get a free pass expressing yours?

It seems we will find out this year. I won't be upset if he can block well though. I think we've all spent the past few years forgetting that's what TEs are also supposed to do."

Saints,3773yw,flordeliest,5,Tue May 26 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be more than serviceable, he's easily good for 500 yards and a couple of redzone TDs next season. Good blocking TE but more importantly he allows for match-up shenanigans that Payton loves. Unlike Graham he doesn't come of the field for a FB so its way less obvious if we are running the ball. I expect him to eat  on play action."
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 25 18:55:51 2015 UTC,What matchup shenanigans? We don't know what Hill is going to be like when teams actually cover him.
Saints,3773yw,flordeliest,6,Mon May 25 19:06:25 2015 UTC,"I team can put their best coverage LB on Hill but he isn't likely to be helpful against the run because Hill is 255 and they are 240 at best(Luke Kuechly is 235) and it's is a mismatch. If they do do this than its likely freeing up Spiller out of the back field. They could put someone bigger in to challenge him off the line but then there's a receiving mismatch. No huddle allows us to abuse a mismatch once its already on field, until a the D uses a Time out.  In a power run offense Hill is usually more useful than Graham is, plus his chip blocks are bound to be more effective. Its much safer than counting on Graham to catch a jump ball they now is coming.  At the end of the day Hill is a true TE and Graham was more or less a WR."
Saints,3773yw,Hotdog_Skin,3,Mon May 25 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think he's referring to how Hill can block unlike Graham, so Payton can get him on a mismatch since the defense might expect him to be blocking instead of catching. The mismatch will come from him being able to mask the play, not really about Hill's skill."

Saints,3773yw,maxfaulkner,9,Tue May 26 16:06:00 2015 UTC,He is no Jimmy Graham obviously but I'm more than happy with him being the starter at this point.
Saints,3773yw,flordeliest,2,Mon May 25 12:46:51 2015 UTC,He's better tan Shockey.
Saints,3773yw,theultimatehero2,5,Mon May 25 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think we can expect a similar offensive scheme to 09 with Shockey. Dump offs and shorter routes and more TE blocking. I think Hill can be serviceable if not above average in that system. The situations where we used Jimmy in the past will be replaced with more RB plays, screens, swings etc. Obviously the TE game will not be nearly as vertical without that athleticism, so we will see the deep shots going to speedy outside guys more this year than we did the last few seasons.   It would make sense to assume we will have a more ""West Coast"" style offense with all of the attention we are putting on QB protection, but we all know Drew will look for the deep ball when he has time so as long as we have a few guys with speed we will still stretch defenses. I think for this reason we need Sean to realize Cooks is more than just a shifty slot receiver. He has ELITE straight line speed and he can take the top off of defenses. He is small, but speed kills."
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 25 16:31:47 2015 UTC,"Shockey was so beat up that year. All he could run were curls and he'd sit down after he caught the pass. He probably had negative YAC that season, or at least during the playoffs."
Saints,3773yw,paradigmshift7,2,Mon May 25 18:23:03 2015 UTC,I think Cooks will be used like that more this year. The last couple of games before his injury he was targeted on more vertical routes.
Saints,3773yw,Salamanderfs,3,Tue May 26 01:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a good, sometimes great blocker, and can be even better. If he catches balls at around 80% of Graham's rate, then I'll be pleased. We won't see blanket coverage on Josh Hill so he can break free and get open easier as well. Drew will find him, he will find the endzone."
Saints,3773yw,aimerj,3,Mon May 25 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"It's whatever, loved Jimmy but Drew Brees makes his receivers, not the other way around."
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,3,Wed May 27 05:00:34 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be serviceable. People on here have way too lofty expectations thinking he'll put up numbers that Top 5 TEs put up. If you think he'll get 1,000 yards and/or 10 TDs, you need to dial it down a notch. Very few tight ends reach that goal and you're putting an UDFA who has never been asked to play the majority of the offensive snaps in a single game do that. If he can get 500-600 yards and 4 or 5 TDs, he had a good season. We don't need Hill to replace Graham, just 60% of him. Brees can spread out the other 40%.   As for last season, Hill succeeded at everything Payton asked him to do. But without Graham, Hill can't produce like that. One of the biggest tells in football was that it was very likely we are passing when Graham was in the game and running when Graham was on the sideline. I want to say three of Hill's TDs came off blown coverage because of play action while Graham was on the sideline. That's not available to him next season.  Also, I don't remember Hill catching a contested pass, because he didn't have to. Hill was an afterthought and got his numbers off blown coverage either off play action or having Graham draw coverage. Graham's biggest strength was the contested pass, so Hill needs to prove he can jump."
Saints,3773yw,dean815,5,Mon May 25 15:16:11 2015 UTC,He had 5 TDs last year on like 20 targets. Kid has a nose for the end zone
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon May 25 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"Like I said, a lot of those stats were products of Jimmy Graham being on the team. Play action worked a lot better when Jimmy Graham was pulled off the field, and 3 of Hill's TDs were off broken coverage due to just that. I believe his other two TDs came from Graham pulling double coverage in the red zone making Hill the open man.   5 TDs on 20 targets mean nothing next season, because next season he is Graham."
Saints,3773yw,makeplayz,5,Mon May 25 16:06:56 2015 UTC,But what NFL teams are expecting him to blow up next year? Ingram Spiller and Cooks will draw the attention. Hill could very well get decent stats
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 25 17:57:00 2015 UTC,He absolutely could. I hope he will. The problem I have is people are expecting him to put up huge numbers. We need to curb those expectations.

Saints,3773yw,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 25 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"Unlike Graham, Hill doesn't come off the field for run packages. I also imagine most of his catches will come off of play action, not that he isn't already a mismatch for most LBs. The more teams plan for him the more useful he is in getting others open. Now as a redzone threat I think he can beat any LB and or non-primary corner for the ball, but we should be doing this instead.  Graham isn't in on this play. Robinson is wide open too. Exact same play."

Saints,3773yw,sophandros,1 point,Mon May 25 19:07:13 2015 UTC,"I'm saying if he is 80% of Jimmy, I'd be happy."
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon May 25 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"I think you underestimate how good 80% of Jimmy is. Over the past 4 years Graham has averaged 1,100 yards and 11 TDs. 80% of that is 880 yards and almost 9 TDs. That would be good enough to be the third or fourth best TE in the NFL."
Saints,3773yw,sophandros,1 point,Mon May 25 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, no! I ""underestimated"" by a whopping 30 yards...  Hell, if he has the same YPC as 2009 Shockey and (due to system) gets a few more touches, then he gets to the 80% of Jimmy numbers.  Those are not unrealistic, especially when you look at it on a per game basis."
Saints,3773yw,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon May 25 22:41:31 2015 UTC,the 30 yards isn't important. What's important is Hill hasn't played more than 20% of a football game since college and your expectations for him is a Top 5 TE in the NFL.   80% of Jimmy Graham is basically Greg Olsen or Jason Witten. You really think Hill is as good as those guys?
Saints,3773yw,sophandros,1 point,Tue May 26 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat my earlier comment:  If he provides 80% of Jimmy's production, I'll be happy.  You're reading a lot into a very simple statement."

That's setting up a guy, who could grow into a good player, for failure."

My friends league has only been around for one season (in the inaugural champ, WOOT) but I'm hoping we can get something like this going in a couple of years.

Saints,373ia4,Megawatts19,1 point,Sun May 24 22:44:21 2015 UTC,You should definitely do it. We reward the champion each year with a custom jersey based on their team uniforms. Congrats on your championship. We're going into our 10th season. I've made it to the championship game four times and won it twice. I got upset in the playoffs last year by the guy who had Cam Newton (who scored 40+ points that game and then promptly got into that truck wreck). I'm a little bitter.
Saints,37101s,cheetah_kibbles,20,Sat May 23 21:21:56 2015 UTC,Nah. My friend packed up Pierre's things from his house earlier this week. He's moving back to Chicago. Idk what he has going on now.

Saints,37101s,sophandros,5,Sat May 23 21:38:33 2015 UTC,"Training camps don't start for another month, so it's entirely possible that he's moving back to his hometown to wait things out. If he doesn't sign, then he's home."

Saints,37101s,hrafnass,2,Sun May 24 03:28:46 2015 UTC,I only saw 4 to 5 Detroit Lions Games last year but under Lombardi they had a similar Screen game to us. He could be a playmaker there.
Saints,37101s,looter504,1 point,Sun May 24 06:24:02 2015 UTC,I was hoping the Colts or Pats would snag him up. Good opportunties out of the conference. Still not outside realm of possibility.

Saints,36ynhe,Phunkatron,4,Sat May 23 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"I personally could see him being next man up for outside corner if Lewis or Browner go down and/or getting in on Big Nickel packages, obviously depending on what he and PJ Williams show in training camp and preseason. I have great expectations for this guy in Saints' future going forward. Apparently over a dozen NFL teams tried to snag this guy up after he shined in the CFL last year."
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,5,Sat May 23 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"At the minimum we keep 5 CBs for the 53 man roster, right now we have 9 CBs. So four aren't making the 53 man roster.  I personally consider Lewis, Browner and P.J.Williams safe. If I had to chose of those left to make the roster I would chose Breaux and SJB. If SJB is indeed terrible than Dixon instead. Swann and Frederick to the practice squad and I doubt Wilson clears waivers. Honestly anything can happen."
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,6,Sat May 23 06:13:48 2015 UTC,I agree. I could see the Saints keeping 6 if they think that Williams (and/or maybe SJB) can get work in at Safety.
Saints,36ynhe,sfzen,5,Sat May 23 06:21:17 2015 UTC,It will likely come down to special teams play. The better gunners will be the ones to make the roster. SJB is long but his acceleration is pretty poor.
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,4,Sat May 23 06:56:33 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to special teams play, Brian Dixon wins every single time."
Saints,36ynhe,sfzen,1 point,Sat May 23 07:27:29 2015 UTC,"I think Breaux is #3 corner with Dixon and Williams as #4 and 5, with Dixon slightly ahead. Besides special teams play, Dixon has the best technique among the back-up corners. SJB is boom or bust at this point and I don't think the fact that we traded up makes Swann safe."
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,1 point,Sat May 23 08:26:28 2015 UTC,"I just feel like everyone is expecting way too much out of Breaux. WE signed him from the CFL. Sure, Cameron Wake is great, but for every CFL star that hits it big in the NFL, there are a dozen or more misses. It would be a huge deal for him to land the #3 job over a 3rd round pick."
Saints,36ynhe,sfzen,2,Sat May 23 08:48:10 2015 UTC,"Breaux was literally the top corner in the CFL, its just a matter of adjusting to NFL routes and speed. Williams is safe from being waived but I don't think he can beat out Breaux or Dixon who have a ton of experience on him. SJB is another story."
Saints,36ynhe,ThorBarnes,1 point,Sat May 23 08:57:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty much ready to move on from SJB. Even if he was a project, he was still a 2nd round pick that couldn't earn any semi-significant playtime in our dumpster fire of a secondary last season.  Call it a failed experiment and move forward."
Saints,36ynhe,makeplayz,1 point,Sat May 23 09:09:45 2015 UTC,This is what I don't understand. Why move on from SJB so soon? We literally just drafted him last year. We knew he was raw. He's only played like three seasons of CB. They drafted him knowing he would take at least a season to learn.   Everyone expects the rookies to be dominate from the first snap. I have full confidence that SJB will earn a roster spot and will eventually be a starter.
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,1 point,Sat May 23 11:40:55 2015 UTC,"He was drafted specifically as a project player. You have no clue what we have in him yet so why are you so sure you're ready for him to be cut? Sean Payton said he's definitely playing this year, after playing 38 snaps last year because our secondary was depleted by injuries. He wasn't supposed to play a down last year. But was forced to.   You're calling an experiment that just got past the the first step in the instructions a ""failed experiment."""
Saints,36ynhe,flordeliest,1 point,Sat May 23 16:08:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not too hopeful for him either. If he doesn't put it together by game 3 or 4 of preseason, I just can't see the coaching staff keeping a 26 year old ""project"" on their 53 man roster. His elite size and plus ball skills could make him great if he ever puts it together, but that's a big ""If"" at this point in time.   Hopefully We can keep him on to develop if Williams can cross-train as a DB. I would suppose development-wise the ideal group would be Lewis, Browner, Vaccaro, Byrd, Williams, Bush, Breaux, SJB, Sunseri/Warren, Wilson (or Dixon/Fredrick/Swann).  Edit: it may sound tangential and slightly farfetched, but I think the number of DBs we keep comes down to if Orson Charles can make the roster as FB and TE#3. That extra roster spot might do it, but this is most due to my lack of faith in Lorig (Austin Johnson is better anyways)."
Saints,36ynhe,makeplayz,1 point,Sat May 23 06:58:36 2015 UTC,SJB is 25 not 26.  I personally don't think Watson is guaranteed a roster spot.
Saints,36ynhe,jackmuhswag,1 point,Sat May 23 08:33:34 2015 UTC,Ah my mistake with SJB's age. Who do you have taking TE#2 should Watson not make the roster?
Saints,36ynhe,makeplayz,1 point,Sat May 23 09:15:19 2015 UTC,He probably will but I'd be hard pressed to proclaim a guarantee.
Saints,36ynhe,sfzen,1 point,Sat May 23 09:19:30 2015 UTC,"I think Watson will start as the #2 but then be moved to the #3. He's 34, and he didn't look so great to me last year. I feel at this point he's on the roster for character/locker room presence."
Saints,36ynhe,Big-Zoo,5,Sat May 23 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"We are keeping more than 5 cbs.  I'm guessing 6 or 7. There's no way swann would clear waivers,  so we're not going to cut him.  I'd say we keep browner swann Lewis Williams, Breaux,  sbj, and Wilson/dixon/Frederick (if we have room).  Payton says that sub defense is getting more and more important,  so we'll need lots of corners and safetys.  The fact that Williams and swann have the versatility to play outside inside and safety almost guarantees they make the 53."
Saints,36ynhe,KTDL,2,Sat May 23 14:41:14 2015 UTC,I agree. We kept more safeties then CBs last year. I see us running 6 or 7. Probably 6 tho.
Saints,36ynhe,aimerj,1 point,Sat May 23 16:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think Dixon makes the roster because he's been outstanding on special teams. Frederick has shown a lot of promise (I think he played the entire game against Detroit either last season or the one before), so he's got a good shot. Also, we traded up for Swann, so I think he'll have a decent shot as well, especially since he can also play safety.   We've had some serious issues with injury crises in our secondary over the past couple of years. I really wouldn't be surprised if we keep 6 or 7 CB's, especially if you consider that Williams and Swann could play safety in a pinch.  I think Lewis, Browner, and Williams are the only absolute locks. SJB hasn't done anything, but I don't think we'll put him on the practice squad and risk losing him. So he gets my #4 spot. I'd give Dixon the 5th spot because (I've said this many times before) he is the best special teamer we've had in around a decade; he is always excellent in punt coverage. I can't imagine us not also taking one of Swann, Frederick, Wilson, and Breaux. I think Wilson is the odd man out because he's not as young as the others. Same for Frederick, though the coaches might put a lot of stock into his bright moments. Swann gets a big advantage of being our draft pick, especially since we traded up for him. I just don't see Breaux beating out Swann for that 6th spot, honestly."
Saints,36ynhe,Saints2Death,3,Sat May 23 07:26:32 2015 UTC,"I went to alot of his Hamilton Tiger Cat games. He was lights out helping the team get to back to back Championships, tho they lost. But that wasn't his fault. If he doesn't make the roster i'll eat my own shorts if he doesn't make the roaster and see play time behind browner"
Saints,36yuyw,Phunkatron,2,Sat May 23 07:33:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think we would keep both Saunders and Murphy, and I don't see us only carrying two tightends."

My biggest critique for your list is that I don't see us keeping only 7 O-linemen on the roster. We struggled with injuries on the line last year."
Saints,36yuyw,sfzen,1 point,Sat May 23 09:27:11 2015 UTC,Tul will start the season on IR. And Breaux for Sanford. And Saunders is totally expendable.
Saints,36yuyw,flordeliest,1 point,Tue May 26 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"The only things differently I'd do from you is:   Switch out Saunders for either Jones or Prater, since we don't need so many return specialists Switch out Harylson for Powell. Powell was a 5th round pick last season so we invested a lot in him just to move away after one season, where as Harylson is over 30 and although he does have experience, it's not good experience. In a competition for roster spots I just don't see Harylson beating out a bunch of 20 year olds with experience.  I want to put Swann somewhere in the DBs, but I can't figure it out. I can't see him beating out Breaux for the 6th CB spot, so maybe beat out Warren as a safety? I don't know how the DB competition is going to work out, but it's going to be exciting. Kicker I'd go to be Hocker just because I want a change here. LS is Justin Drescher, the best long snapper in the league!"

Bunk doesn't have much left and now we are praying Jenkins is average next year.  This article is pretty bad it mentions Saunders as a receiving threat option for next year, he isn't likely to make the roster, we picked him up to return punts after Byrd, Cooks and PT were hurt. We have since got Byrd and Cooks back as well as added Spiller and Murphy, so his days are pretty numbered."

Besides, WR wise, can't we stick Spiller in the slot? I think he will be awesome in fantasy IMO.  I also think they don't need a bunch of ""good and experienced"" WRs. Stick Pead in the 6th man Big package and run. Forget about these competitions between Pead/Strief, just have basically 6 O-Lineman every run play and beat people up!

Saints,36xfca,jackmuhswag,2,Fri May 22 22:31:38 2015 UTC,Would be shocked if he didn't. I'm not convinced they won't cut Rafi since PW costs less and played better last year.
Saints,36xfca,dean815,3,Sat May 23 01:11:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I doubt they cut Rafi he is our best SS(sorry Vacarro) and he can also play FS. Next season Vaccaro will be back in his 2013 hybrid role and we will be running three safety sets again. FS are Byrd and Warren as his backup, and SS will be Bush and Sunseri as his back-up, with Vaccaro doing his thing in the slot and generally be closer to the LOS where he is way better.  If I had to guess Sanford and Philips are the ones who won't make the 53 man roster. And I have a feeling we will have more CBs than Ss on the roster this year.  Edit; Also Warren is 6'2 way bigger than all our other safeties outside of Vaccaro."
Saints,36xfca,flordeliest,2,Sat May 23 02:00:51 2015 UTC,I hope so. Last year we carried more safeties than CBs.

They really don't have much to cling onto with their lack of recent success. That was us not to long ago. However I despise the way they site how notoriously dirty Greg Williams defense was as evidence. They post one slo-mo highlight to invoke an emotional response and  completely distract from the definitive evidence or lack of such. The Saints are accused of doing this for three years and they literally make the whole situation about them and the one game we played against them."

Saints,36tlv1,Thunderjugs,9,Fri May 22 05:57:58 2015 UTC,Reading that thread brought back some really shitty memories and feelings. Bountygate was announced on my bday that year. The circlejerk BS is the reason I stopped posting in that subreddit. It's good to see some people coming around though.
Saints,36tlv1,Guyote_,2,Fri May 22 04:15:47 2015 UTC,"I was at my local gym when my friend came up to me from the locker room, and said ""Hey, did you hear about the Saints?"" As a huge Saints fan, I was like ""No...?""  He said, ""I was watching ESPN in the locker room. Something about a bounty program?""  I was like ""What the fuck?"" Went to the locker room and there was a big group of guys just standing around watching the tv. Its always stuck with me, that moment."
Saints,36tlv1,PatSayJack,6,Sat May 23 06:53:11 2015 UTC,"It's always amazing to me how many people are 100% certain of facts that were thrown out during the investigation for being just plain wrong.

Saints,36tlv1,IceCreamJonsey,5,Fri May 22 15:18:44 2015 UTC,"Great point. Every single person over at /r/NFL considers themselves an elite fan to some degree or another, but when it comes to anything with the slightest bit of nuance they reveal themselves as dickheaded half-wits. They believe, literally, everything Goodell had to say about the situation, but if asked them directly in a different context, they'd say he has no credibility. That said, /r/NFL does tend to act as a sponge to suck up the greatest wastes of space on Reddit, so it serves that purpose."

Anyone who would wish death upon people (and mean it) over a football game are human trash.
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,-14,Fri May 22 23:09:25 2015 UTC,"I believe you are referring to myself, I happened to see this thread and I am just sort of confused.   I don't really care, but the fact that you all downvoted me into oblivion for posting a contrasting point of view, with sources, is pretty pathetic.  Glad that you all got your kicks for the day though, sorry for not completely agreeing with you and attempting to discuss it."
Saints,36tlv1,PatSayJack,11,Fri May 22 13:57:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly man, I'm all for discussion, but you were going after people's credibility in almost every comment.    Jesus, at least with the Patriots that argument could maybe (?) be made since there breaking of the rules wasn't that bad. But with the Saints? Cooommmee on bro, they were intentionally trying to hurt players, that isn't something he just drummed up. You are delusional and blinded by bias. Greg Williams admitted to the entire thing..   ""Cooommmee on bro""  is not an argument. Calling people delusional is not warranted, especially when there were several us in the thread making entirely rational points regarding the lack of evidence in the case. You linked the SI article in almost every comment on the thread. Peter King was working with even less information when he wrote that than we have at our disposal now. The article was reactionary and assumptious. He makes claims to know things that happened in that locker room down to the detail of what players would chant when they allegedly received bounty payments. There are no sources in his piece and he makes it the juiciest story possible.  Generally, I like reading Peter King's stuff, even after the Bountygate stuff, but I find this analysis to be a good perspective on his writing. He's a storyteller who is fascinated by football ans sports. He can write a hell of a story but you have to understand that it's his job to take what is often a relatively uninteresting outline of a story and color it in with whatever colors make it most interesting."
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,-3,Fri May 22 15:47:44 2015 UTC,"Come on bro was one line in that comment, comparing Bountygate and Deflategate is a ""come on bro moment"", that just insane.  Completely different scales and one involved injuring players.  It was extremely frustrating to see the back and forth purly between Pats and Saints flairs that the NFL was out to get them.  Notice how no one else chimes in with that?   I said above that calling them delusional was probably over the top."
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,6,Fri May 22 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"There's a very direct correlation between the two which is that both situations involved huge punishments that were complete departures from the previous precedent set by the league in either case. The major points of argument are different in each though, because in the deflategate case there has been a lot more transparency, which has happened largely due to the fallout after the bountygate situation was handled poorly. The main issue is that it will forever be tied directly to alleged intent to injure when there is zero evidence to support that claim."
Saints,36tlv1,baconlovr,-7,Fri May 22 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"You continue to say there is 0 evidence, when that just isn't true.  I posted some, there is also the Vilma offer that Gregg Williams confirmed.  Just because you all want to think everything he said was a lie, doesn't mean it wasn't evidence.  There are players that used to play for Williams (I remember Matt Bowen specifically) saying they had it in place on former teams.    There is evidence.  This is why I get upset, is there an argument that it wasn't as bad as we thought or that there wasn't enough evidence to punish?  Yeah.  But to say there is no evidence?  That is where my delusional and bias statements originates, they didn't just make all of this up.  Edit: I am done, though, I don't want to be the guy arguing this.  It isn't like I will change anyone's mind.  And to see some of what I can only assume to be you guys downvoting all my old comments as well, including one where I was giving encouragement to someone really down on his luck, is just silly.  Great people."
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,3,Fri May 22 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"The only comment I've downvoted of yours is the one I referenced in an earlier comment, just so you know. In fact I've upvoted you more times than I've downvoted you. My apologies for people who are being childish about it.  Anyway, the Matt Bowen piece is pretty interesting and certainly doesn't help the Saints' case, but a few things: as he noted in the article, they were paid out for big hits, and clean hits by the rule book. They weren't necessarily getting paid for injuring someone but for hitting them as hard as they could within the context of the game. As stated before, precedent set by the NFL itself states that players would be allowed to have small PFP programs as long as they weren't for exorbitant amounts of money or on illegal hits. Furthermore, the fact that Gregg Williams ran a program like the one described in NO previously does not necessarily mean that it existed in the same capacity in New Orleans."
Saints,36tlv1,baconlovr,-3,Fri May 22 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"There is also the Coy Wire piece:  http://www.buffalorumblings.com/2012/3/9/2856900/coy-wire-gregg-williams-bountygate  While what he says does help the coaches, it also shows that there was a pool among the players for hurting players.  Very similar to what came out about Vilma.  So, again, to say there is no evidence is a ridiculous claim.  I am not saying it makes it 100% true, but there is evidence. Again, the scale may be questioned, but I am pretty sure that the Vilma portion is true.  Just watching the game it was apparent they wanted Favre out.  The email with Payton is also evidence, no matter what you say.  Again, it is all good, but I am not sure what I said in previous comments to get nuked, other than disagree that there wasn't evidence.  My one comment did likely deserved downvotes for attacking you guys.  Oh well, the votes don't matter, it just seemed really silly."

Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,3,Fri May 22 19:03:18 2015 UTC,"you saying you're ""pretty sure"" the Vilma portion is true doesn't make it true. most of what non-Saints fans know about Vilma is what he has been accused of and that's about it. If you've got something proving the allegations to be true I will just put the point to rest, but nobody has been able to do that for me.   With the Coy Wire piece he directly says that Gregg Williams wasn't involved...again, nothing certain about it, but wouldn't that go a lot further in support of my argument than against it?"
Saints,36tlv1,PatSayJack,-4,Fri May 22 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"He says it was encouraged in the environment.    As for your first part, what I said was that I was pretty sure.  I didn't say I was sure, I said right there I am not saying ti makes it 100% true.  You can't prove it was 100% false either.  I don't understand why I can't have an opinion on it and you guys can?  I have provided the evidence that leads me to believe it was true, ex-players of the coach saying they had a similar system, an email discussing a bounty, and the DC saying he should have put an end to it and knew it was wrong, along with a video where he tells his players to ""Kill the head.""  Just because you don't consider that evidence, doesn't mean I don't have to.  Do you really not see how the way you all are arguing this can be extremely frustrating?  I can understand the belief that there wasn't enough evidence to punish the way they did, but that doesn't mean I can't believe it based on what I have heard. To throw out every piece of evidence because you don't personally think it is enough or relates, is being bias.  Again, at least I am saying I am ""pretty sure"" where as you guys are all pretending you know, factually, that this never happened.  But I am the pathetic one, right?  EDIT: Here is the evidence about the Vilma situation  http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8391657/new-orleans-saints-jonathan-vilma-meets-commissioner-roger-goodell  Again, just because it is convenient for you all to throw Gregg Williams statements out, doesn't mean the rest of the world has to."
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,7,Fri May 22 17:16:21 2015 UTC,"It's all good. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. Whether it's right or wrong, biased or unbiased, should be irrelevant. Reddit has seldom been a place where people have to provide proof to every post they make. I just hope that one day Vikings and Saints fans will look past their differences and realize that in the end it's a very insignificant matter."
Saints,36tlv1,ClaireBear86,-11,Fri May 22 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"I don't have any hate for the Saints, I just think is pretty ridiculous to claim there wasn't any evidence of a bounty system set up and then to compare a bounty scandal to a deflated balls one, it is upsetting.  I am sure I sounded like a salty Vikings fan, but I don't blame any of that for losing that game.  I just don't really appreciate Pats fans and Saints fans ganging up on a different opinion because it goes against their team.    You are right, it doesn't matter anymore, but it was very significant for all of football."

Saints,36tlv1,ClaireBear86,-3,Fri May 22 14:53:46 2015 UTC,"No problem. Thanks for not ripping me a new one, I just felt a little vilified after 100+ downvotes and a few call outs here.  I don't think I said anything particularly ridiculous, except calling the guy delusional and blinded by bias.  But to think that there wasn't anything wrong going on, seemed completely ridiculous to me.  I can't pretend I am not bias, though, but I don't think you all should either."
Saints,36tlv1,BeanAlai,3,Fri May 22 15:01:09 2015 UTC,The thing is most of us thought there was something wrong going on.  We just think the ensuing investigation and public opinion trial was a farce and we were railroaded into punishment without any real evidence.  Where there is smoke there is fire but you can't convict someone of murder without a body.
Saints,36tlv1,ClaireBear86,-4,Fri May 22 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Well none of the posts I read seemed To give that vibe, they seemed to suggest there was no wrong doing, other than a pay for performance program. I don't think my posts go against what you are saying."
Saints,36tlv1,baconlovr,3,Fri May 22 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"Here is where I think the biggest difference is in opinions.  Everyone thinks we were Tanya Harding running around swinging clubs at players knees and purposefully trying to break key body parts to a take a guy out of the game.  They think we sat in the locker room and plotted an assassination attempt before each game.  They think that as the DE is bearing down on a QB he is thinking, ""Well, I would just tackle him but the $1,000 promised in the locker room sure would buy my wife a nice purse...fuck it, go for the knee.""  What we think happened.  Greg Williams is a fucking moron and he took a practice the players were already doing and organized it.  He took something players on every team do and put it down on paper and turned it into a program.  It started as, ""Hey Roman, I bet you $100 I get an interception in this game before you do.""  ""Hey Fujita, I bet you $500 I'm the first LB to get to the QB today.""  The money was not a motivating factor.  The competition to be the better player was and the money was a fun way to do it.  Just like when Michael Jordan bet on his luggage coming out to the airport terminal before the rest of his team.  These dudes are where they are because they are insanely fierce competitors.  So Greg Fucking Williams decides to amp up the game and raise the kitty.  Greg Fucking Williams was the one telling players to go for the head and kill the body.  But no one did it.  Did you hear anyone in that audio yelling, ""Yeah!!!  Fuck em up!!""  No.  Just because the coach said it doesn't mean the players did it.  Also, part of the P4P (which the media coined the terms bounty and injury) was fines against players for dirty hits outside the rules of the game.  IMO, their fear of leveling a dirty hit and getting a penalty is what resulted in them being one of the least injurious teams in the league.  The money was not for a broken leg.  It was for a Ray Lewis/Troy Polamalu style blow up remember-me hit.  Like the one on Warner that was legal and clean as fuck.  That was football hitting 101.  What was done to Favre was shitty and dirty.  The refs should have started throwing flags early on and slowing that shit down.  But if you think for one second that $10,000 that was supposedly offered (according to Greg Fucking Williams) was the reason they were hitting Favre you are dumb.  There was a Superbowl at stake.  You guys were good that season, maybe even better, but there was a spirit in NOLA that year that rivals that of the Seahawks in 2014.  We just weren't going to let anyone stop us in our house.  The same way hockey playoffs get dirty and brutal in the playoffs.  There should have been punishments.  GWilliams should be banned from the league.  Vitt should have been suspended for the season.  Payton should have been fined.  The team should have been fined MILLIONS.  But to hamstring us the way they did compromised the integrity of the game.  Our entire fanbase knew we couldn't win that year even though it was one of the best teams we have ever fielded.  Our opponents couldn't brag about beating us, we had been muzzled.  That kind of punishment hurts the fans and the rest of the league more than anything.    On top of that, you and I are destined to have this circlejerk forever because Goodell completely fucked the entire investigation up from floor to ceiling.  It is no coincidence he was kicked off the investigation.  It is actually his fault that most of the suspension were thrown out because he went off all half loaded and lied about everything.  And everyone else ate it up.  I don't blame you guys, you were fucked the hardest by us.  But no one else but Saints fans is interested in understanding the actual truth behind it.  That's why we get so fired up defending it."
Saints,36tlv1,jacksandwich,-1,Fri May 22 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything you have said, except that they were merely going for big hits. They definitely seemed to have an over malicious way to finish plays, in particular hits on the QB.   I do think what you have said here is as close to the reality of the situation as possible. Thanks for laying it all out like this."
Saints,36tlv1,brenden4000,3,Fri May 22 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for others, but I downvoted you and said you were pathetic because you ignore the facts you don't like and cherry pick statements that bolster the fantasy that there was a bounty program.  You also claim that daybreaker was stating that nothing illegal was going on when he in fact claims just the opposite.  He explains that the pay for performance was illegal. Yet you stare that people are claiming nothing illegal happened.   This leads me to the conclusion that you are detached of the reality of the situation."
Saints,36tlv1,Megawatts19,-2,Fri May 22 19:56:48 2015 UTC,I very clearly say that he claims nothing BUT a pay for performance program was going on... But I am the one cherry picking right?

Saints,36skia,DarkSquareBishop,10,Thu May 21 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Don't get too excited about this. We're not paying Drew Brees $53M over the next two season to hand the ball off. It's just impractical to think we're going to change our offensive philosophy while Brees is behind center.   We might run the ball more, but it's only going to be a slight increase if any. The changes we made this offseason is to increase our running games effectiveness, not become a running team. Only 9 teams ran the ball that many times last season, and the only team with a borderline elite QB to do this is Dallas. Seattle also had over 450 carries last season with an elite QB, but Russell rushed for 118 times. Take out their running QB and Seattle doesn't hit your 450+ rushing attempt criteria.   Brees will still throw 650+ times next season and when the game is on the line, it's still going in No. 9's hands. You can count on that.   Edit: This is why we won't run 450+ times next season. If you combine Ingram, Spiller, Robinson, Strief, Peat, Armstead, Lelito, Unger, Evans, Watson and Lorig's 2015 cap hit and it comes to $25.5M. Brees alone has a $26.4M cap hit. ... You don't put all your money into the passing game and then focus on the run. It's just not how the NFL works."
Saints,36skia,Saints2Death,5,Thu May 21 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"Good points. I could still see OPs scenario playing out, though, if we are *consistently starting hot in the 1st quarter and building comfortable leads by halftime. I'm not saying that will be our situation because nobody knows, but it definitely wouldn't surprise me if it was happening."
Saints,36skia,ImShadier,3,Fri May 22 00:33:44 2015 UTC,"True. In a game-by-game situation, I can see a game where we run more than we throw. But over the course of the season, I don't see our pass/run ratio varying too much from where it's been since Brees signed this contract.   Since Brees and Payton arrived, our offensive philosophy has been - if we can put Brees in a situation where he can get X amount of yards with Y amount of turnovers, we are Z successful. The running game has and will always feed off the passing game. The formula for success has always been where to invest money and draft picks around Brees.   IMO, the moves we made this offseason showed we are putting our faith in Brees to keep his same production while we use the money and former draft picks that were used as Brees' weapons last season to improve other areas on the team. These moves weren't made so that Ingram gets 50 more carries a season. These moves were made so that Ingram get .5 yards more per carry."
Saints,36skia,Saints2Death,3,Fri May 22 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"At this point, I think Brees's salary is more a function of his track record and the Saints's loyalty to what he's done than anything else. I totally agree that the ball belongs in his hands when the game is on the line. I just disagree with the notion that the coaches are sitting in a room consulting the payroll to make gameplanning decisions. You go with what has the best chance of winning, and in my humble opinion, that involves running the ball a lot this season. Either way, I'm cautiously optimistic about this coming season!"
Saints,36skia,DwightKPoop,5,Fri May 22 01:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this. They're not going to spread out touches based on salary. Jimmy Graham saw the ball a ton while getting paid very little on his rookie contract. As one of the posters said, this is all about efficiency. They want to become more efficient in the running game which, in turn, will make Brees more efficient. Payton strives to have a balanced offense so that he can keep defenses guessing. I think we'll see a stellar year out of the offense."
Saints,36skia,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 22 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think the moves this offseason were for us to run the ball 50 more times in 2015. I think the moves this offseason were for us to run the same amount of times, just .5 yards per carry better.   Brees, at 36 years old, still has the ability to be the MVP of the NFL and break every single season passing record. In a season-by-season basis, he's still one of the ten best players in the entire NFL. Sure you don't want to build a franchise around a 36 year old QB, but going into 2015, Brees is as good if not better than any QB not named Aaron Rodgers. That's why his salary is where it is.  To back up my opinion on why I don't see us changing offensive philosophies, just read my reply to ImShadier."
Saints,36skia,sophandros,1 point,Fri May 22 01:50:25 2015 UTC,I hear you. I just don't think going from 400 to 450 or even 480 rushes in a season is that dramatic. That's like 3-5 more rushes per game. That's Brees going from 40 passing attempts per game to 35-37. They'd still pass more than run.
Saints,36skia,NewRedditorHere,1 point,Fri May 22 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"In 2011 we ran 431 times and passed 662.  In 2009 we ran 468 times and passed 544.  If the offense is clicking and if the defense creates turnovers three and outs, it's conceivable that we can run it 450 times with our elite QB at the helm."
Saints,36skia,Ezmoneh,3,Fri May 22 13:21:33 2015 UTC,"I think you guys will have the same amount of touches per game, +2ish maybe.  But having spiller for screens will add a dimension that will take you guys back to elite offense level, something that you guys have been missing with Sproles gone."
Saints,36skia,makeplayz,1 point,Thu May 21 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"I think spiller is going to be more of a Darren Sproles type player, most of his production coming from returns and receptions rather than the workhorse carries that Ingram and Khiry are built for"
Saints,36skia,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 22 14:32:38 2015 UTC,"Spiller had 207 and 202 attempts (roughly 12/gm) in 2012 and 2013 and got 1244 (O_O) and 933 yards on the ground those years. He's in his prime, coming off an injury. Dude can run the ball. I still think the Saints would be wise to get Ingram and Spiller 20 and 10 carries/game respectively. Whether they run him that much or not, I'm absolutely stoked to see him in black and gold this season!"
Saints,36skia,aimerj,2,Fri May 22 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"What's crazy is, I said this for TWO YEARS on Twitter and Saints fans called me stupid, said I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm a hater, I'm not a real fan.... you name it, it was said to me.  Maybe it was because of my ""theory"" as to why we started passing so god damn much after the Super Bowl. Who knows. All I know is, when we traded Jimmy for Unger I was ecstatic. I wanted to trade Jimmy last year when we had him tagged. 2 firsts was sufficient for a 3rd round basketball player that had one year of football under his belt before arriving.  They also might have hated me because while Brees was negotiating, I was saying things like, ""if we pay Brees all this money we're not going to be able to keep Jimmy Graham."" Low and behold, look who the fuck was right alll along. Suck it Twitter Saints fans, you're all ignorant. Go back to what you were doing before you became a football fan 5 years ago.  We're about to run the ball so much in 2015 that I'm thrilled beyond belief. I've always been a believer in the run game, it helps your defense immensely. Our defense needs help immensely. Teams are symbiotic to each other. If our offense runs the fuck out of the ball, kills the clock, limits the amount of time our defense is on the field, it puts a limit on how much the other team can score. And how many teams can outscore Peyton and Brees?"
Saints,36skia,makeplayz,3,Thu May 21 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"We might run the ball more efficiently next season, but it doesn't make any sense to increase the amount of run plays on our offense. We're the No. 1 offense in the league yardage wise and we're paying Brees more than everyone involved in our running game combined. There's no way Brees throws the ball less so that we run the ball more. We can run the ball better, but we're just not going to run the ball more. It would be bad business."
Saints,36skia,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu May 21 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"So two years ago you said we would be running the ball 500 times? If so, you were wrong both years."
Saints,36skia,makeplayz,1 point,Fri May 22 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"No I said we abandon the run too early, too often. We dont give any player on our team a chance to ever get a rhythm going. We have so many personnel groupings that guys are coming on and off the field pretty much every down.   I simply want a back to get 300 carries and allow him to be the focus of the offense. After the Super Bowl we became an offense that leaned heavily on the pass and I noticed it and didn't like it. How many players do we have left from our Super Bowl team? Do you know why that is?"
Saints,36skia,aimerj,1 point,Fri May 22 03:52:52 2015 UTC,In 09 we had a defense that got an insane amount of turnovers that lead to us running out the clock. I'd love if that's the case next season.

Saints,36kspy,TamponFingers,0,Wed May 20 14:16:26 2015 UTC,I got a feeling Strief might not be on the team by the time the season gets going. He's been a valuable player for years but I can't see either at guard so I think he'll be gone. I don't think Peat will sit the bench for a year so I'm thinking this is the move that will be made
Saints,36kspy,Iwouldlikealongeruse,1 point,Wed May 20 17:57:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. We just gave Strief a big contract a year or two ago, and he's been our best, most consistent lineman for several years now. He's also a team captain. I don't see us moving Strief just because we have Peat. Peat's on a cheap rookie contract, so we can afford to have both of them for a couple of years."
Saints,36kspy,sfzen,1 point,Wed May 20 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"Lelito is extremely underrated, no one is giving him the benefit of the doubt even though he did really well on limited minutes."
Saints,36kspy,pomeranc,1 point,Wed May 20 20:08:43 2015 UTC,I'm fine with Lelito at OG. The whole reason he was our starting C last year when Goodwin was injured was because he did so well rotating at OG the year before. That doesn't mean we have to get rid of Strief. Why throw away talent?
Saints,36kspy,sfzen,1 point,Wed May 20 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"If he wins the position, that's great, but he hasn't done anything in his career to warrant giving him the starting job. There should be a huge competition for the LG position, one that the odd man out at T should compete for. If Lelito wins the spot then he deserves to start."
Saints,36kspy,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed May 20 22:38:27 2015 UTC,That makes sense and then use Peat the way Strief was used in the beginning of his career as the 6th/swing OL. I could see that working as well.
Saints,36kspy,Iwouldlikealongeruse,1 point,Wed May 20 20:50:28 2015 UTC,Exactly. Especially  since our OT depth was absolute garbage before we got Peat. Peat (or Strief; whoever isn't the starter) is still our only decent backup.
Saints,36kspy,sfzen,1 point,Wed May 20 20:53:12 2015 UTC,"Considering our LT went out a little last year, it would be a mistake to not have a starter quality backup if we can afford it."
Saints,36kspy,aimerj,1 point,Wed May 20 20:52:30 2015 UTC,I'll bet that Strief is still starting RT and Andrus is the swing tackle.  There's no way Strief would be cut. I could see them trading him if they think Peat can step in day 1 but even that would be a stretch.
Saints,36kspy,dean815,1 point,Thu May 21 13:44:54 2015 UTC,Depth at O-line is never a bad thing.
Saints,36kspy,DarkSquareBishop,10,Fri May 22 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"This kind of seems like NFL.com just throwing something together without really putting much effort in. They only seem to care about their ""Woah, the Saints might start 4 rookies!"" headline, and don't really go into detail about anything else at all.  We traded for Ellerbe because Hawthorne shouldn't be a starting LB. And the 4-3 scheme they have here doesn't make any sense for us. Anthony could probably play OLB in a 4-3, but he's better off as an ILB in a 3-4 for us, and Kikaha definitely projects more as a 3-4 pass rusher than a 4-3 coverage OLB. Plus, I'm not sure Kikaha wins the starting job over Haralson/Edebali immediately.   I'd hope Peat can win the starting job over Lelito, but I'm still not sure exactly how Payton will configure our line. The year we won the Super Bowl, we used Strief pretty heavily as a 3rd/Swing tackle (Stinchcomb was still out starting RT), so I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see Peat in that role instead of actually starting early on."
Saints,36kspy,sfzen,1 point,Wed May 20 07:53:25 2015 UTC,I feel Kikaha will be a 3rd down situational rusher. You're right about everything tho.
Saints,36kspy,makeplayz,1 point,Wed May 20 15:20:15 2015 UTC,No way Peat or Strief play guard. They're both tackle sized and Strief has never played inside.

Saints,36kspy,ShrimpBoots,2,Wed May 20 11:56:54 2015 UTC,We rarely play a 3-4. More often than not we're in a 4 man front.
Saints,36kspy,Saints2Death,4,Wed May 20 19:13:28 2015 UTC,"Payton mentioned several times that we were getting the personnel this year, meaning we didn't have the pieces we needed to run a 3-4.

Saints,36kspy,dean815,2,Wed May 20 16:08:09 2015 UTC,Just curious why you picked Kelemete over Lelito as the starting guard?
Saints,36kspy,FerociousLamb,1 point,Wed May 20 16:19:38 2015 UTC,Think he has a higher ceiling and Lelito is better as depth because of his experience at center.

Saints,36kspy,dean815,1 point,Wed May 20 19:57:50 2015 UTC,I like the way this looks. I see us rotating a lot of guys in the front 7 as Rob Ryan loves to do so it doesn't really matter who is starting. It will all depend on situations.

Plus, Peat can play on the left or the right, so he would be more versatile as a swing tackle.  Swann over Williams and Wilson at Nickel CB? Why? He was a 5th round pick, and all I've heard is that he wasn't all that great in college."
Saints,36kspy,sfzen,2,Wed May 20 18:34:18 2015 UTC,both good points. It just seems like PJ is more set to play outside.
Saints,36kspy,flordeliest,1 point,Wed May 20 18:38:39 2015 UTC,"I think PJ will play outside if/when he becomes a starter, but he's got the skillset to play inside. Basically the way I see him is, he's got the skills of a nickel CB and CB/S hybrid, and he's got the size of an outside corner."
Saints,36kspy,jackmuhswag,1 point,Wed May 20 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"Well I'd want Vaccaro in the nickel and on TEs like we had in 2013, and move Bush to SS role.  And WR #3 is Toon and #4 probably Morgan. Which one? IDK"

Saints,36atcx,halfassgenie,5,Sun May 17 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"Josh hill seems to be the guy that is going to fill in for jimmy. He's a good player but the general concensus  around here is he will produce about 80% of what jimmy did.   This is just my opinion but I don't think all of the missing production is going to go to one player in particular. I think cooks, colston, and hill will all see an increase in looks this season, and I would expect spiller to have a similar role to what bush had when he was here. Who really knows what will happen though.   As far as fantasy goes hill could break out and be a top 5 tight end but that is being optimistic. You should be able to get him pretty late too. Ingram will probably break a 1000 yards this season if he can stay healthy, and we continue feeding him the rock. I would expect cooks and colston to just get over a 1000 yards receiving also. Those are probably the only players I would consider for a fantasy team."
Saints,36atcx,thatfenguy,6,Sun May 17 21:41:35 2015 UTC,Hill is going to be way over drafted. I'd be shocked if he was not the 5th TE taken in most drafts. He's done nothing to warrant that.
Saints,36atcx,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun May 17 23:04:52 2015 UTC,Why? I haven't heard too much hype for him away from this place. He reminds me more of David Thomas than Jimmy Graham.   Edit: Never mind. I just read your comment down the page.
Saints,36atcx,Jaime-Foxx,3,Mon May 18 08:25:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well-thought answer. It sounds like Cooks is the one I'll try to pick up. I tried for Colston last year and was a little disappointed with his production. Luckily another one of my ""maybe he'll be good this year"" picks with Louisiana ties (OBJ) lessened the blow."
Saints,36atcx,Zakimus,2,Mon May 18 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"Thing with Hill, he's already gaining traction. He's gonna be so hot closer to training camp and his ADP will continue to rise."
Saints,36atcx,dean815,1 point,Sun May 17 21:47:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I see Colston getting 1000 yards this year. I think 800 or so is more realistic. Cooks can definitely get there if he stays healthy
Saints,36atcx,xbaited,3,Tue May 19 13:02:50 2015 UTC,Brandin Cooks and CJ Spiller. Especially if it's PPR a league.
Saints,36atcx,Megawatts19,1 point,Sun May 17 21:44:16 2015 UTC,I'm usually in a 10 team league with some guys from work. It's not a PPR league and is set up to really reward TDs (6 per TD) over yardage (1 per 15 yds). Any round projections for those two guys?
Saints,36atcx,Saints2Death,3,Mon May 18 02:33:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know round projections or ADP, but I'd keep an eye on Ingram too with the bolstered OL. He may be a solid snag for a second tier RB."
Saints,36atcx,Megawatts19,4,Mon May 18 14:54:38 2015 UTC,"Right now he's projected at the end of the third, but I got a feeling he's going to be a solid second rounder that sneaks in the first a lot when real drafts start. Like LeVeon Bell last season."
Saints,36atcx,aimerj,1 point,Mon May 18 16:56:13 2015 UTC,I didn't realize he was projected quite that high. I havent looked at any mock drafts or ADP yet.
Saints,36atcx,dean815,1 point,Mon May 18 17:15:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I can definitely see him having a big year if he stays healthy. From an outsiders perspective, I would say he's very clearly the top dog in your committee, which means he gets more touches than most committee backs."
Saints,36atcx,Saints2Death,3,Mon May 18 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"I see Colston's production slipping even more (too many hits across the middle for a guy so tall screams nerve damage.) Josh Hill will probably have 5TDs maybe 500-800 yards. CJ Spiller if healthy to me will be like Piere Thomas, if Ingram or Robinson is hurt, then value goes up but I just see a big play waiting to happen, never better than a flex starter against a good rush defense. Drew Brees, and I know a lot of ppl think picking a QB in first round is a bad decision (experts mostly), will be worth a first round pick if it's late first. I see our receiving core being Cooks with a good year, Toon Maybe becoming Stills (less talent), big play ability, more of a 3rd down conversion guy. Honestly I can only see starting Cooks, Ingram, Brees, DST (If you believe we solidified it) and Josh Hill if you lost out on the TE pool."

He knows how to get around that. At 6'0 he has not, and never will try to look over the head of his offensive linemen regardless if they are 6'4 like his two guards last season or if Strief moves inside at 6'7. He's going to do what he already does, look around the guards. Strief could be 7'0 tall and could play guard, because Brees would never try to look over his head.   Anyone who thinks a guard's height has any impact with Brees is delusional and have never paid attention to Brees in the pocket."

Saints,368hgu,NewRedditorHere,3,Mon May 18 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Well I personally don't really think the Saints overhauled that much.   The talent we add is proven. We added Browner at CB#2. After cutting White and not re-signing Robinson. This alone basically fixes the majority of the problems with our pass defense. They were the reason we lost several games last year.  We revamped our LB corps, with Ellerbe and Anthony after cutting Lofton(you already know his deal).  Other than Kikaha probably starting at Sam nothing else is that different on defense. We have basically the same D-line that ranked 4th in sacks only a year ago. Our offense is more re-hauled than our defense is.  The Falcons D-line is still M. Goodman, K. Beirmann, T. Jackson, P. Saliai, C. Peters and R. Hageman, the exact same as last year. At least Hageman is young and probably still improving but dude the other guys are still a big part of the problem last year and the addition of Clayborn doesn't change anything. He is just as questionable as they are, Beasley an undersized rookie OLB is your most proven pass rusher. At the most the Falcons improved their linebacker corps with  Justin Durant(29) with his fourth team and Brooks Reed(28) an all right LB who played behind an exceptional D-line in Houston. I have actually met Reed at a BK in Houston. He forgot my Dads fries, though I think Whitney Mercilus is the one to blame because Reed was just working the drive thru. Proof  I personally disliked the Falcons off-season decisions. They shouldn't have paid Saliai or Jackson so much last year, and this year they signed Durant and Reed for way to long a contract."

Didn't like the brooks reed shot but I accept it. Yall did a great job improving positions of need in which yall didn't have as many holes as us(the Falcons). We didn't address our horrid offensive line and are basically hoping they don't get injured the entire season which is unlikely with this group while you guys got a pro bowl center, a promising tackle for the future to help out what wasn't the best line last year. You replaced Thomas with spiller whom I believe have similar play styles. Got Anthony who is athletic enough to cover tight ends and running backs unlike lofton. Signed a true number 2 cb while getting back Byrd at FS and Vacarro can't possibly play as bad as last year. We still have holes at tight end safety and oline and we're going all in on a lb corps that didn't even finish last season for the most part I think durant played 9 games and reed only played 6 I believe. Schofield is unproven and worrilow is a poor mans Curtis lofton. Beasley is a question mark in my opinion and most Falcons fans have way to high of expectations of him. We haven't had a 10+ sack guy in two or three seasons and most expect him to do that as a rookie and I don't see it happening, but would be ecstatic if he did."
Saints,368hgu,mbluhm36420,1 point,Mon May 18 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see Spiller as directly replacing PT, He is really replacing Sproles a year late.  Vaccaro played a completely different role last year than in 2013. In 2013 Vaccaro played the slot or LB/S and last year he was traditional cover 2 SS. The biggest difference was that he was usually much further from the line of scrimmage and took a ton of bad angles that resulted in a lot of missed tackles.  His ability to change directions isn't as good since his ankle injury, didn't help either. He was moving back until Byrd, Bush, Sunseri all got hurt.  After that we ran a stupid amount of zone schemes because everyone, other than Lewis, can't be trusted in man coverage.  Also Humbar who played way to much last year, got pushed way down the lineup behind Ellerbe and Anthony."

Saints,368hgu,KGB_ate_my_bread,4,Sun May 17 14:38:41 2015 UTC,The truest answer.
Saints,368hgu,zeeyellowdart,5,Sun May 17 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"The Falcons don't have the defense yet. They're still relatively weak in the front seven. They can score with anyone, but can't stop anyone. The Panthers aren't getting better and better. They had probably the most questionable draft in our division. Pinning their hopes on injury prone Jonathan Stewart and once again forgoing drafting OL help to keep Cam from taking hits. It will be between us and the Panthers. The Falcons may make some noise, but not enough to win the division."
Saints,368hgu,Megawatts19,4,Sun May 17 12:59:56 2015 UTC,"Biased I may be, but the defensive overhaul isn't sexy but is nice. Clayborn if healthy is a 6-9 sack guy. Reed and Durant are good in coverage and stoping the run. This allows Worrilow to be less out of place in coverage. Which in turn mitigates some of the over the middle cheese.   The line, while not great, is better. I mentioned Clayborn. Beasley will have an impact. He may not burst on the scene but he is in a perfect fit.   Finally scheme. We ran a 4-2-5 with only one quality backer on the field. I don't think this defense is top ten but I think we (falcons and saints) will fight for the division."
Saints,368hgu,oballistikz,5,Sun May 17 18:41:31 2015 UTC,Clayborn's highest sack total was 7.5 sacks 4 years ago. You're batshit insane if you think he's a 6-9 sack guy.
Saints,368hgu,Saints2Death,0,Mon May 18 00:18:40 2015 UTC,So +/- 1.5 sacks is insane? Okay
Saints,368hgu,oballistikz,2,Mon May 18 06:30:31 2015 UTC,Yes when you're taking a guys best year which was 4 years and a ton of injuries ago.

Saints,368hgu,dean815,1 point,Tue May 19 13:15:19 2015 UTC,"Clayborn is not good, and Reed and Durant, who played averagely behind really good D-lines, don't necessitate a turn around by any means. Outside of Beasley, who is still pretty undersized and a liability against the run for college standards, the Falcons have made slim to no effort to increase the effectiveness of the pass rush.   The Falcons could be a drastically better team next season and still win only six wins, because they were lucky to have six last year."
Saints,368hgu,flordeliest,2,Sun May 17 20:43:53 2015 UTC,"Clayborn got 8 sacks his rookie year and 6 in his third season. Injuries aside he is a good player. Calling him ""not good"" is both wrong and arrogant.   Reed and Durant are average if not a tad better but that's an upgrade. So what's your point there. We made a move to upgrade the OLB position and did.   Beasley is 246. Miller is 250. You going to tell me Von Miller is too light too?  Barely/lucky to win six... Not even remotely true. Hell we lost two based off of time management alone.   Your comment oozes of arrogance and misinformation."
Saints,368hgu,oballistikz,2,Sun May 17 20:54:17 2015 UTC,Von Miller is undersized.
Saints,368hgu,flordeliest,2,Sun May 17 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"You were luck to win against the Saints week one.   You were lucky to beat the Panthers week 11.  You were lucky to have faceed the Cardinals with a third string QB.  You were lucky Armstead our LT went down in week 16.   You were lucky.   On the flip side if you were luckier, you might have beat the Browns and Lions.   If The Saints were luckier we could have won 5 more games last year."
Saints,368hgu,flordeliest,2,Sun May 17 21:05:44 2015 UTC,This is true arrogance here. Every team ultimately wins because a couple plays went their way.   And how you can argue Von Miller is underweight while getting 14 sacks is pure ignorance.
Saints,368hgu,oballistikz,1 point,Sun May 17 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"And to be specific about the five extra games. Both the Falcons games, the Browns, Lions and 49ers games, probably the second Panthers games. I don't think we are significantly better or worse than any of those teams but a luckier draw could have won several of those games."
Saints,368hgu,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 18 01:36:07 2015 UTC,Von Miller is a great player but his sack total last year doesn't equal or modify his literal weight. At 250 pounds he is undersized. For rushing OLBs  255 and less is undersized.   You keep using arrogant wrong. It refers to a sense self importance.
Saints,368hgu,flordeliest,2,Sun May 17 22:21:22 2015 UTC,"What he says 'arrogance', he refers to your extreme arrogance of the saints(which is understood from a die-hard fan, even like myself) which in turn leads you to have extreme hate towards the Falcons, which in turn makes you have a skewed perception of our defense."
Saints,368hgu,NewRedditorHere,2,Mon May 18 00:16:06 2015 UTC,I don't hate the Falcons. And arrogance is the wrong word given the context. Bias would be more appropriate.

Saints,35zyhy,baconlovr,8,Fri May 15 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's about game integrity. Rewarding a player for hitting someone when they're already trying to do that is not as bad as deflating the game ball to gain a slight advantage, in my opinion."
Saints,35zyhy,oddmanout,12,Fri May 15 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"Also, there was no unfair advantage to what the Saints did.  They didn't manipulate any equipment, they didn't steal anyone's plays, they didn't pump fake sounds into a stadium to make it harder for the other guy's offenses, there were no P.E.Ds or stuff sprayed on uniforms or gloves.   There was also no proof whatsoever that any player tried to intentionally injure another player. There certainly wasn't any flags thrown for it, and no one can come up with a video of a defensive player doing something that even sort of looks like he's trying to injure someone."
Saints,35zyhy,therealjz,7,Fri May 15 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"Right? And since when aren't defensive players trying to hit guys as hard as possible? That's always been the name of the game.

Saints,35zyhy,quantumhed,6,Fri May 15 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Any defender who goes out and brutalizes his opponents will be rewarded with a multi-million dollar contract.

Saints,35zyhy,phluidity,5,Fri May 15 16:40:33 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  I firmly believe that if the Saints had come out and said from the beginning, ""we encourage our players to play hard but within the rules, and yes, we have a pool for players to reward each other for outstanding play as a way to keep each other accountable, just like many other teams at every level of football.  It was our understanding that this was permissible within the NFL framework.  If that isn't the case, we're sorry, and will accept whatever punishment we deserve."" then the worst that would have happened was a fine, and maybe a 4th or 5th round draft pick.  Instead they were defiant, and we know what happened."
Saints,35zyhy,makeplayz,1 point,Fri May 15 16:48:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. But just like with NE, lack of evidence and a biased 'investigation' with a biased conclusion.

Every team has done every bit of those things, and more. Just depends on if the NFL wants to do something about it. They know what teams are doing what. Just better not piss of the league or they'll take action. What Brady/BB/Pats have done to piss the NFL off, who knows?"
Saints,35zyhy,quantumhed,3,Fri May 15 16:52:57 2015 UTC,"Evryone forgets the greater context of the scandal. At that time, the NFL was facing it's potentially greatest scandal ever: Head Injuries and the deliberate actions to avoid responsibility for it. They were facing serious media pressure and the cloud of congressional intervention was was drawing upon them. The NFL chose to sacrifice a franchise in order to get everyone off their backs.  And obviously, a small market team, one not beloved by the National media was the perfect target once the allegations came to light."

The consistency of cheating and the Patriots leads me to the thought that this should have been tougher. Rice beats his wife and gets 2 games, does not affect the integrity of the game, yet, the Pats are convicted in the eyes of the commissioner. Now the appeals must take place and we'll see where this shakes out. I don't think we'll see such a biased hit that the previous commish will have to come in and overturn things. I believe that the punishment will be overturned on Brady but the picks will be lost like ours were. I would like to see consistency in the sentencing that we lost our pick the year we were 'convicted' by the commish. The Pats get a solid year to plan, and why not a second round pick instead of a 4th the following. I would have been fine with it being a first or a second, a fourth isn't really much especially the way the Pats stack picks."

Considering there were years of investigation put into the bounty situation versus presumably a one time incident with deflating the balls, the standard set by Payton's punishment does not apply. The Saints were warned to stop the program meaning Payton had notice well before any punishments were handed out, therefore he had a responsibility to ensure he got his team under control and shut it down. That's the only reason I could understand why Belichick is not being held accountable as well. He can't stop an infraction he has no knowledge of."

Patriots stadium security assaulted a drunk fan after removing him. Belichick should be punished.  Two coaches working directly for Sean Payton were complicit in an illegal bounty program. Payton should be punished.  One of those things is not like the other. Last time I checked, Belichick isn't in charge of the equipment managers. They work for him, at best, indirectly. Then again, so do the sales agents and security. I mean, if he says he wants discounted tickets sold to someone, they'll do it. If there's a rowdy fan behind the bench, security will remove them.

We had to catch an early morning bus, and I was able to check the halftime score right before I left my hotel room, when it was tied (this was maybe 5am India time).  I tried to sleep on the bus and kept having nightmares about Matt Schaub and the Texans beating us (which obviously makes no sense--I don't know why the Saints were playing the Texans in the NFC championship, in my dreamscape).  When I woke up, I anxiously opened my laptop, and loaded up the ESPN NFL homepage. The first thing I remember was Anthony Hargrove's giant body in the splash image (or maybe it was Ayodele), and the word 'Miami'. What a season that was!"

As a die hard saints fan who wasn't able to watch this game the first time there is nothing more important to me than knowing that Brady is appealing the suspension just like everyone knew he would. Even better is how much I care about deflated footballs and the dick swinging contest between the pats and roger Goodell!!! It's such an important issue I mean how could you not cover it 24/7 for the entire offseason? It's not like it's not gonna change anything... Yes the pats still won the Super Bowl, Brady is still an all time great, and roger Goodell will always suck but the real issue that needs to be looked at is why football no longer has anything to do with actually playing football. It's all about who's beating there wife and who's gaining no advantage by cheating (Cleveland, Atlanta I'm looking at you). Can we just go back to when football was about playing football."

Saints,35ztbd,jsb93,2,Thu May 14 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"The main reason we were ranked 31st on defense was because of Corey White and Patrick Robinson.

The DL wasn't getting pressure, LBs consistently missed tackles, and the safeties misdiagnosed coverages often. Just look at how many times the defense couldn't get off the field on 3rd down."

The line looked slow and soft, the LBers were constantly getting burned in coverage missing tackles. and the DBs (All of them) were constantly misjudging angles and blowing coverages...especially the safeties on third downs."

Saints,35ztbd,ovivios,7,Fri May 15 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"I like that the general consensus among the subreddit is that there's no way Payton would be fired, which is accurate. Shows the respect Payton has. I personally think if the Saints miss the playoffs again they will, or at least should, do a massive overhaul of their coaching staff, with Payton still remaining as head coach. That means guys like Ryan, McMahon, Vitt, position coaches, even Carmichael being replaced with new coaches who can come in and work with Payton to try and improve this team. If the Saints take another step back this year, or simply don't take a step forward, they'll need to bring in some good new coaches who can motivate and develop the players and get schemes in place on defense (and offense) that can help get the team back in contention. If the defense is bad again this year, the Saints will obviously be in the hunt for a new defensive coordinator and will hopefully be able to bring in a talented one if necessary. I also wouldn't mind the idea of bringing in a new offensive coordinator if the Saints miss the playoffs, as it would give them the opportunity to bring in a talented offensive mind to work with Payton and potentially add some new aspects to a Saints offense that has largely remained the same during the Payton era and has become predictable at times. Payton does a great job with the offense, but bringing in another talented offensive mind to work with him and help him wouldn't hurt."
Saints,35ztbd,Im_Daydrunk,3,Fri May 15 02:40:39 2015 UTC,What are your thoughts on the lack of a veteran leader on defense being an issue? Do you think Browner can immediately fill that void?
Saints,35ztbd,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri May 15 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think/hope the way the season and offseason went kicks the team into gear. After having a poor season last year, hopefully the players realize they need to be fully committed and put in the maximum effort or else this season will end very much in the same way. Also, in an offseason when so many players were cut or traded, hopefully the players realize that if they don't buy in, that they could just as easily be traded or cut and replaced with someone who will.  That being said, I put that more on the coaches than on lack of veteran leadership. It goes both ways, and hopefully the likes of Jordan, Ellerbe, Browner, Lewis and Byrd can step up as veteran leaders on defense, but it is also on the coaches to control the players and ensure that the players know the system and they are where they need to be. Sure the losses of Vilma, Smith, Greer and Harper definitely was felt as they lost some veteran leadership, but the coaches still allowed the locker room to slip out of their grasp and for it to get where it did last year, and they have to ensure that veteran leaders or not they have to control the locker room.  That being said, I think things will improve this year. Really the only ""problem players"" left as far as the locker room goes are Galette and Vacarro (at least out of guys who were reported last year to be potential problems), and I think the fact that they focused on bringing in high character guys in the offseason (Unger, Browner, Spiller, Ellerbe, Spencer) and the draft (Anthony, Peat, Kikaha, Tull, Davison and Swann were all noted as high character guys) will help to get the locker room back where it needs to be. And I definitely think Payton won't be afraid to make major changes this season if things start to sour in the locker room again."
Saints,35ztbd,michael_mains_medic,2,Fri May 15 16:54:31 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with that. I like that that is what they focused on, and for some reason, after reading your comment, I got really excited for the season haha."

Considering there were years of investigation put into the bounty situation versus presumably a one time incident with deflating the balls, the standard set by Payton's punishment does not apply. The Saints were warned to stop the program meaning Payton had notice well before any punishments were handed out, therefore he had a responsibility to ensure he got his team under control and shut it down. That's the only reason I could understand why Belichick is not being held accountable as well. He can't stop an infraction he has no knowledge of."

Saints,35s82j,lossaysswag,1 point,Sat May 16 15:43:46 2015 UTC,"The Ravens are why the ""sting"" happened in the first place.  But you're approaching this the wrong way.  Neither the bounties nor the deflated balls are or should be a big deal. However, the league prefers to manage the message at all times. They know that teams still motivate players to make big hits and big plays. They know teams doctor equipment to gain an advantage. The problem is that they don't like that part of the game being talked about in public. Ever wonder why only the NFL network does the ""miked up"" broadcasts? That's so they can control the message.  So these cases are similar in that someone leaked elements of the game that the leagues doesn't like out in the public, so when it got out they have to come down hard in order to maintain a certain perception and image. The league realized the ""investigation"" with bounty gate was lacking and the punishment too harsh, so they had this ""investigation"" and came up with a less destructive punishment which still sent a ""stern message"".  This is not about doing the right thing. It's about money, and Goodell's job is to protect the owners' money."
Saints,35s82j,FloridaLee,1 point,Sat May 16 15:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'm simply saying it's much easier to justify holding Payton accountable when he was explicitly notified by the league that the system needed to be abolished.  That's why it's hard to say ""well, Belichick got off so Payton should have too"" based on that fact.  Now, you can argue for why Payton shouldn't have been suspended based on other criteria, however I was initially providing a train of thought that made exonerating Belichick acceptable."
Saints,35s82j,smacksaw,0,Sat May 16 16:13:08 2015 UTC,Don't care. I understand people want to compare Deflategate with the bounty program but we are past this. We can make a whole bunch of noise about all of this in hopes that maybe Goodell will become so unpopular with team owners that they throw him out but I highly doubt that will happen. We can talk all day about how unfair the Pats punishment is in comparison to what we got yet it won't change our past. I don't give a damn. I want us to win. LEGITIMATELY.

I seriously don't get his hard-on for the Saints. He's a Vikings fan. Is it like...the long con?  It's amazing how he can constantly write about this and be incomplete.  Florio - dude, it's fairly simple.  Bill Belichick didn't lie about Deflategate. He didn't know anything.   Payton did lie about Bountygate. He lied repeatedly. He asked Williams to lie and Williams turned around and implicated Payton.   Payton did his best to stifle the investigation. Belichick did not.  Let's just say for the sake of argument both ""-gates"" are bullshit. It's still not comparable because Sean and Mickey did everything in their power to hide facts, thwart the process and lie. They were both incredibly involved.  Belichick was barely involved and quickly cleared because he had nothing to do with it. Even as a manager, he is barely peripherally accountable to his underlings because he is so far removed from the controversy.   Of course Florio leaves it out. I just don't know why."

I can't remember what he said about the coaches and GM, but they are employees of the league so Goodell has more say over their punishments. I think the thing that made Bountygate more severe was the fact that the league found out about it in 2010, Loomis promised to take care of it but did not. And then when the league came sniffing back around in 2012, the team stonewalled it. When Benson turned over the emails, it was all there in black and white. I remember reading that the Green Bay Packers had a similar issue, maybe in 2007, the league confronted them about it, and they put a stop to it. So if they had ended it in 2010, we probably would have never heard about it. I guess it is what it is. Everybody hates on Goodell, but he has a hard job. Of course, that's why they think he's worth $55 million a year."
Saints,35s82j,baseddogpatrick,1 point,Wed May 13 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"While this is all plausable, I think it's fair to say the NFL has an air of arrogance to it that hasn't dissipated since Goodel took office. Their rules are not gospel unless something gets leaked to the media, then suddenly, any rule broken is seemingly punishable by jail time."

Before the injury, he would most always go down on first contact. DBs could drop him no problem. Then after the injury, he looks like a completely different player. Moving faster and more decisively. He hits the hole like a madman and soaks up hits taking 3-4 guys a lot of times. I love having a power back now. Changing to the zone scheme has helped him immensely. Can't wait to see him tear it up again this year."

Saints,35qce1,CallMeGerbraldo,3,Tue May 12 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"Considering he started all the games for the Hawks last year and they had the best defense, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he's easily better than Jenkins and Bunkley. His ceiling in Minnesota was much higher than either of them have ever sniffed and he didn't have injury woes last year like Bailey did his preceding year. We just need him for 1st and 2nd downs. Hopefully we don't let him leave without a deal."
Saints,35qce1,subcriminalmessages,2,Wed May 13 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe Bunkley, but I think the jury is still out on Jenkins. He hadn't recovered from that injury until mid season last year. I think with a full offseason of conditioning, he's going to be our primary starter before not too long."
Saints,35qce1,Hotdog_Skin,2,Wed May 13 05:30:03 2015 UTC,"I think we know Jenkins will never be a super star by now. He could be a decent starter, but I think his ceiling is Andy Dalton of NTs."
Saints,35qce1,Saints2Death,2,Wed May 13 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"There's a large gap in between serviceable and superstar though.   I'm not saying he'll be a superstar, but he looked like our future starter in 2013, and last year he still hasn't come back from that injury(torn pec?) until later in the season. I think he lost all his conditioning over the offseason while recovering, so he had a long way to go before he was even in football shape.  Probably not a ""superstar"" but the jury is still out. We certainly can't say a 34 year old tackle is ""easily better"" than him yet."
Saints,35qce1,Hotdog_Skin,2,Wed May 13 16:48:25 2015 UTC,Oh completely agree on Williams. The point I was trying to make is I don't want to get in a situation where we don't improve at NT because Jenkins is serviceable. A great NT could turn a bad 3-4 average and an average 3-4 good.
Saints,35qce1,Saints2Death,2,Wed May 13 18:47:41 2015 UTC,Is he better than Bunkley? Probably  Will he be able to show that in a visit? Probably not.

This is just catering to the crybaby bitches that obviously need more serious problems in their lives if the photo ruined your day that much to need it removed.

At least Deflategate kinda works cause it rhymes, but ""bountygate?"" Come on.  (And yes, I do know that it's been called that since it happened but this graphic just emphasizes it.)"
Saints,35nhhm,benjay67,8,Tue May 12 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Unrelated, but... Bendgate, Gamergate, antennagate.   All of this started out because of the Watergate hotel.   Makes you wonder why it isn't called defghazi?"

There were multiple fines as the league learned more/decided they hadn't punished the organization enough. Of course, all of the top 3 teams in this list won Super Bowls during their scandal, so it's not like this whole Patriots thing is unprecedented."

Saints,35nzmt,WhoDatAficionado,11,Tue May 12 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"Meh. If you mean to compare with our bounty allegations, it's a bit different because ours was allegedly a systematic problem and was much more of an issue in terms of player safety etc. This was largely inconsequential and only got hit so hard because of the cover up and repeat offenses.   That said I still disagree with the bountygate ruling and it was just Goodell trying to make an example of us with nothing but circumstantial evidence.   Also I think this punishment is a bit much. Biggest fine in history, first rounder, and franchise qb for 4 games. Just as unprecedented as the bountygate ruling."
Saints,35nzmt,dean815,0,Tue May 12 02:09:35 2015 UTC,I would like for two games and all the draft picks.

Saints,35ib8u,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Mon May 11 13:32:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was killing me.   I think part of the reason we were doing that was because Payton had no faith in our o-line to give Brees time to take shots downfield. We literally game planned around our crap o-line.  We are all hated to see Graham go, but it makes sense that we did whatever we had do to make sure we don't have to game plan like that again this season.  Let's stretch the field again!"

Saints,35ib8u,TheAwes0meFish,2,Mon May 11 14:55:24 2015 UTC,I agree. The broadcast makes it more exciting to watch imo
Saints,35ib8u,Dj_Nussdog,-8,Sun May 10 21:06:16 2015 UTC,Lol be thankful I didn't use a rap song about sex and drugs. But I'm glad you like the highlights themselves. I like to switch up music genres when I make vids. Broadcast commentary would get boring
Saints,35ib8u,KingManlet,8,Sun May 10 22:59:24 2015 UTC,"To the contrary, I think any music is only taking away from your results.  Commentary, specific to the play, certainly wouldn't tire like a song or song(s) would. Also, I know YOU may think you're going to pick the super-coolest songs but not everyone will agree with you."
Saints,35ib8u,jibjab89,4,Sun May 10 23:20:40 2015 UTC,Yea you right. I only know two people in my life that like the exact same music as me so obviously not everyone on here will like my music choice or anyone else's music choice for a highlight vid. But hey atleast it's a football vid that can help fill the void known as the offseason

Another takeaway: for all the talk of Brees being in decline, damn he still looks on the money when he actually has a little time to throw the ball. I think the Unger addition is as much about giving Brees a clean pocket as it is about the running game."
Saints,35jdl8,typical0,9,Sun May 10 23:07:57 2015 UTC,A weak center makes the guards look awful.
Saints,35jdl8,Charizard_Targaryen,4,Mon May 11 00:04:18 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/uHSJCDU.png  Not necessarily true
Saints,35jdl8,Hotdog_Skin,10,Mon May 11 00:11:48 2015 UTC,"Not neccesarily true.   Not in every case, but more often than not. In our case, I'd say it's very much true. Our guards were constantly having to make up for Goodwin."
Saints,35jdl8,Charizard_Targaryen,5,Mon May 11 00:15:15 2015 UTC,I'll just rephrase it: a weak center puts a lot of extra pressure on the guards.
Saints,35jdl8,tarantula13,7,Mon May 11 00:17:35 2015 UTC,Unger's grade is more impressive when you realize that PFF uses a cumulative total for their grading. Unger accomplished a 12.4 rating in just 6 games and most of the other names (and centers) you compare it to have a full 16 game schedule to add up their ratings.
Saints,35jdl8,Hedgery,5,Mon May 11 04:48:13 2015 UTC,"The argument could also be made that the small sample might not be reflective of Unger's play as a whole (could argue that if he played more games that he could have had some bad games to bring his rating down). Not saying that would have happened, because obviously Unger is one of the top centers in the game, but it's not like you can look at a +12 in 6 games and assume he'd be a +32 in 16 games (not saying you're saying this but some might make this assumption)."
Saints,35jdl8,Armanewb,1 point,Mon May 11 05:23:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, +12 is the 4th best center in the NFL. If he graded out to a zero for the rest of the games he'd still be a massive upgrade."
Saints,35jdl8,Hedgery,1 point,Mon May 11 19:06:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just feeling real technical I guess lol, probably just shouldn't have said anything. Unger is a huge upgrade for them. Hopefully Lelito plays as well as Payton thinks he will."
Saints,35jdl8,Hotdog_Skin,5,Mon May 11 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"I have heard VERY little ""bad mouthing"" of Strief. I've heard a lot saying Peat will be an upgrade, but that isn't a slight at Strief so much as it's an endorsement of Peat."
Saints,35jdl8,Hotdog_Skin,3,Mon May 11 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"I literally read ""swinging door"" at right tackle and ""completely replaceable"". In a discussion on who the better tackle (and who would better move to guard), it was a certainty that Strief would move inside as Armstead was the clear better tackle. This is just offered to contribute to that argument and maybe show where our offensive line sat following last season."
Saints,35jdl8,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Mon May 11 00:37:26 2015 UTC,And that comment was up voted highly? Be careful not to assume one or two comments represent the sentiment of the fan base.   The overwhelming majority of comments I've seen recognize Strief as an important (yet aging) part of our line. And I personally haven't seen a single person say he was the weakest link and I'm relatively active in our sub.  Maybe it's a thread I missed though.
Saints,35jdl8,serenity_suppository,1 point,Mon May 11 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't say that it represented a sentiment to the entire fanbase, merely an opinion some may hold."
Saints,35jdl8,pomeranc,1 point,Mon May 11 00:50:40 2015 UTC,"True, you didn't state that. To make a post refuting that point of view just made it appear as though it was a common opinion, and not a rare one.  I would just dismiss the few idiots that think Strief sucks lol. They clearly are just overly excited about the new blood and are taking for granted what we already have."
Saints,35jdl8,pomeranc,1 point,Mon May 11 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"he's a good pass-protector, avg. run blocker at best.  Peat's ceiling for run blocker is very high"
Saints,35jdl8,Hotdog_Skin,2,Mon May 11 01:37:19 2015 UTC,Am I the only one frustrated that with all the OL talk going around nobody is wanting to talk about Lelieto's performance last year? Personally I'm curious about his grade but in limited action he looked like a pretty good run blocker.
Saints,35jdl8,jsb93,2,Mon May 11 05:34:21 2015 UTC,"Didn't pay much attention to him, figured he was a swing guy for a reason"
Saints,35jdl8,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 11 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"I guess he looked good because he was a huge upgrade to Goodwin, which isn't saying much but I was really happy when he was on the field."
Saints,35jdl8,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 11 07:01:09 2015 UTC,"I think there just isn't a whole lot to talk about yet. He's seen some action, but it's still not a great sample size. In addition to that, we saw him at center, and everything I've heard says that he's a ""natural guard.""   Personally though, I think he's going to do well at gaurd. I was pleased with what I saw from him at center, so if he's even better at gaurd, I think he'll look good."
Saints,35jdl8,flordeliest,2,Mon May 11 05:43:03 2015 UTC,Goodwin and Grubbs almost single-handedly lost games for us last season. I say almost cause our defense sucked so much ass. Them two were constantly getting pushed back on 3rd and 4th&1 causing us to get stuffed. Evans had a horrible year too but some would say that was cause of injury. Our line should be better with Unger and Lelito in the lineup
Saints,35jdl8,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 11 18:41:34 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else think we drafted Peat to be a backup LT? Lack of LT depth did derail our season, so it would make sense. I'm not against it, it was a BPA pick and Streif is 31, so its not like he will be  backup long but damn a first round pick? Payton really doesn't fuck around."
Saints,35jdl8,IAteTheFridge,2,Mon May 11 01:22:20 2015 UTC,"Bold prediction: Cyril Lemon starting left guard week 1, Andrus Peat starting LT, Armstead moves to RT(what many think is his more natural position). Heard it here first."
Saints,35jdl8,flordeliest,4,Mon May 11 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"You are overestimating Payton's willingness to start a rookie, talent aside."
Saints,35jdl8,Hedgery,1 point,Mon May 11 02:25:23 2015 UTC,I don't have reason to believe otherwise.
Saints,35jdl8,makeplayz,2,Mon May 11 02:28:11 2015 UTC,He started Charles Brown at LT for 15 games before even giving Armstead a shot. It took a blow out against the Rams too. I believe we even tried Strief at LT at one point.
Saints,35jdl8,snoopygeeze,3,Mon May 11 02:30:38 2015 UTC,"Armstead was a 3rd round project player we had drafted that year, he needed time to develop technique. Peat isn't a project, he's a day 1 starter."
Saints,35jdl8,jackmuhswag,-1,Mon May 11 02:36:08 2015 UTC,You seem to have forgotten just how bad Charles Brown was.
Saints,35jdl8,snoopygeeze,4,Mon May 11 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"How bad Charles Brown was is irrelevant, Armstead wasn't ready."
Saints,35jdl8,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon May 11 02:56:39 2015 UTC,Armstrong was getting manhandled by Greg Hardy in his first start so he was thrown to the fire from the very beginning. He adapted remarkably well despite that setback.
Saints,35jdl8,VegasSaint9,2,Mon May 11 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Outside of PRob, every player the Saints have drafted in the first round has started under Payton."
Saints,35jdl8,Saints2Death,-1,Mon May 11 02:40:41 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean anything.
Saints,35jdl8,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 11 02:42:02 2015 UTC,It means as much as any evidence I've seen. Feel free to present some proof other than 'I see your evidence but I still don't agree'
Saints,35jdl8,duchessofsephora,2,Mon May 11 02:54:06 2015 UTC,"Not that I necessarily disagree with you, but that's only nine players (i.e. nine first round picks under Payton prior to this year's draft). That's an incredibly small sample to go off of and say that it is indicative of how Payton handles his first round picks. He'll handle Peat as he handles every player. If he is good enough to start, he'll start. If Strief and Armstead both prove better starters than him in training camp and preseason, he'll be a backup to start his career. The fact that he was taken 13th overall won't make Payton start him. Not saying he necessarily won't start, I think it's about 50-50 that he does right now, but don't think the reason he'll start is because he was a first round pick. Don't like that argument."
Saints,35jdl8,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon May 11 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"but that's only nine players (i.e. nine first round picks under Payton prior to this year's draft). That's an incredibly small sample to go off   No it's not. He's one of the longest tenured coaches in the NFL right now with his current team. If I'm not mistaken, second longest behind Belichick. This is one of the best sample sizes you can analyze from, what the hell are you talking about?"
Saints,35jdl8,sophandros,1 point,Mon May 11 15:02:02 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean anything?  It blows your argument out of the water. Rookies most definitely start and get significant playing time if they can contribute to the team.

I can't stand spam... So I'll post updates once we have a few new podcasts or articles lined up. So we don't clutter the front page.   And thanks for the recommendation. We are still very new so every good word, share, or rating is very important. So hopefully we can get more and more new listeners and continue doing the show as frequently as we have been."
Saints,35henc,thejimmyst,4,Sun May 10 17:39:44 2015 UTC,"2 1,000 yard rushers? That's pretty optimistic, and very unlikely to happen.  Only happened six times in history and one of those was Vick so really 5 times.  To get 1,000 yards you either need a ton of carries or a great average and 200 carries. We've only run the ball about 400 times a season under Payton, so basically he is predicting perfect health for both Spiller and Ingram and career years from both.  We also have Drew Brees."
Saints,35henc,thejimmyst,2,Mon May 11 13:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah it took me by surprise. His reasoning was that Ingram will get the bulk of the carries, but Spiller will get 10 carries a game and have a rediculous Yards Per Carry Average due to how explosive he is.   The logic is sound, but it's a bold prediction that has a lot of moving parts. I know this... If we even get close to two 1K rushers I'll be elated. Plus Emory knows his stuff... So he gets the benefit of the doubt from me."
Saints,35ej22,Jwhite985,29,Sat May 9 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly dont care if they get punished or not. If it was an NFC team like the Seahawks, Packers, Falcons, Panthera I'd say lay the hammer. Also I think its some what of a non issue. I'm also convinced the NFL hates us and that any punishment will be underwhelming compared to ours."
Saints,35ej22,VegasSaint9,16,Sat May 9 16:09:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm in the minority, but I agree with you. They beat the hell out of the Colts. The air was a nonissue.   This is more of an indictment of the NFL's pre-game ball system than anything else. The equipment managers never should have had the opportunity to deflate the balls."
Saints,35ej22,crocajun1003,8,Sat May 9 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and also they knew about this months before anyone. I don't understand how they can ""incriminate"" them when they allowed it in the first place with no warnings. If you could beat a good team 45-7 then go on to beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl by deflating a ball, I think a lot of other teams would've done this before. I think the NFL is kind of back peddling and just going to hand out punishment just because they're in the wrong sorta like Bountygate, but since the NFL isn't dealing with a deflated ball lawsuit, they're just going to give a game suspension or fine."
Saints,35ej22,VegasSaint9,3,Sat May 9 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"Good freaking hell you Saints fans make some damn sense. The Wells report had nothing on the incompetence of the league leading up to the Colts game. If it was THAT big a deal, then... well... why brush it off? Goodell only seems to care about how the NFL is perceived, and handing out punishments based on PR"
Saints,35ej22,dd2811,2,Mon May 11 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"We went through something similar so we're quite educated on how the NFL only cares about self image. I can't believe they took a first round pick AND Tom Brady got four games. I think the ""alleged"" crime/punishment was way worse than bountygate for us. We were accused of something bad, if it were entirely true, which it wasn't, but you know Goodell's gotta protect the image of the NFL by creating witch hunts."
Saints,35ej22,VegasSaint9,2,Mon May 11 22:53:13 2015 UTC,"It's absurd. People here are going bat shit crazy. Not because of what Brady ""more probably than not"" did, but because the report was so damn biased.   On top of it all he has his lackeys make the statement about the punishments for him. Not a peep from Goodell himself. This dude sucks."

Saints,35ej22,dd2811,1 point,Mon May 11 23:13:18 2015 UTC,"The Colts game wasn't the only time they've done that. If they only received a tiny margin per game over others by deflating balls (and their fumble rate indicates that they received a larger margin) over the last 15 years, that adds up.  This isn't a case of motivating players to do what football players already do. This is a case of deliberately skirting the rules in order to gain a competitive advantage from an organization which has a history of doing so."

Saints,35ej22,KGB_ate_my_bread,-2,Sat May 9 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Ok so according to everyone here it's no big deal, except for the fact they cheated!!! Since the rule change the patriots have by far the least amount of fumbles in the league. Is it because an Underinflated ball is easier to hold onto?? So all you people saying its a non-issue what do you have to say about that?"
Saints,35ej22,sophandros,4,Sat May 9 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"Saying that the Pats lack of fumbles is due to long term deflated balls is a bit ludicrous, but I'll respond anyway.   The Pats originally got caught because the Colts defenders noticed the balls felt deflated. The refs agreed and the balls were changed out at halftime. In all the interviews and analysis since the incident, current and former players overwhelmingly agreed that NFL players, who handle footballs every day, could discern the difference between a full ball and a deflated ball fairly easily. That leads us to infer that if the Pats had tried this in the past, they would have been quickly caught.   We're talking about one half of one game in which the Pats absolutely dominated. In fact, the issue isn't the competitive advantage the Pats got, it's whether or not Brady or Belichic were involved. And honestly, I don't really care."

Saints,35bm0u,GenrlWashington,9,Sat May 9 08:46:10 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

Saints,35arjt,aimerj,1 point,Sat May 9 00:21:38 2015 UTC,They filled every need except WR and LG. They must really value Lelito more than we thought because he is going to be a key cog in this overhaul.   At WR I just got off the phone with Emory Hunt and he gushed about WR Brandon Coleman a lot. He thinks that Coleman is going to really step up this year.   I'm looking forward to this season because it feels like an underdog year and when we are counted out... This team rallies together.

Saints,35arjt,avaryvox,2,Sat May 9 17:18:22 2015 UTC,"Wide Receiver hasn't been anything special since Brees got there, a lot of speed guys and late round guys. The 1st rounders were busts. At least Meachem was. Kenny Stills wasn't anyone before last year, Jimmy Graham was kinda weak (My favorite Saint, but even I knew he was either gonna drop it or fumble it-Still pissed he is gone tho.) Point being, us needing quality receivers is very subjective. I agree on LG not being filled tho, but even with Payton saying they won't move inside, Strief still might be moVed inside.

Saints,3589kq,Bouzal,10,Thu May 7 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"I don't understand where all the Brees hate started last season. He was a top QB going into the season, then, seemingly overnight, everyone's opinion changed on him. Tied for first in totals yards, 27th in batted passes, most accurate, I don't get it..."
Saints,3589kq,Megawatts19,4,Fri May 8 01:53:19 2015 UTC,He made several costly mistakes during the first half of the season that IMO cost us games. He played lights out in the second half until the last two games where he kinda shit the bed again.
Saints,3589kq,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 8 02:56:43 2015 UTC,Didn't he have an abdomen strain last offseason? Or was that the season before last? I can't remember.
Saints,3589kq,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Fri May 8 03:24:43 2015 UTC,It was this one.
Saints,3589kq,IReallyLikeFootball,1 point,Fri May 8 22:11:19 2015 UTC,We would have 2 wins at most without him though.
Saints,3589kq,Benxbec,2,Fri May 8 05:43:08 2015 UTC,"And we probably would have won the division if Brees didn't force a pass to Cooks in the end zone against ATL that was intercepted, didn't have that horrible overthrow against Cleveland that led to a pick six, or the interception with 3 minutes left in the game against Detroit that gave them the go ahead TD.   Yes, we are a better team with Brees than without him, but that doesn't mean he didn't make several bad mistakes on the wrong spot of the field or costly mistakes late in the game."
Saints,3589kq,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 8 22:01:34 2015 UTC,"It its those 2 loses we had due to his ""overzealous"" nature everyone remembers."
Saints,3589kq,pottersquash,2,Fri May 8 12:43:43 2015 UTC,You saw how fast people gave up on the Patriots after being 2-2 and losing to KC. There isn't a lot of faith in teams/players anymore.
Saints,3589kq,xbaited,2,Fri May 8 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely. It has quickly become a ""what have you done for me lately"" league."

There was a third were Brees threw an interception with a 6 points lead with three minutes left in the game that led to the Lions' go ahead TD, but NFL.com didn't have the link."
Saints,3589kq,Saints2Death,9,Fri May 8 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"Its amazing. All the talk of his arm strength, he overthrows more than underthrows. All the talk of height, 27th in batted balls."
Saints,3589kq,pottersquash,2,Fri May 8 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, 27th means 26 QB's had less of a percentage of batted balls."
Saints,3589kq,L1Trauma,2,Fri May 8 05:05:36 2015 UTC,I misread. I thought it meant 26 had worse percentage.
Saints,3589kq,pottersquash,2,Fri May 8 12:42:37 2015 UTC,overthrowing doesn't necessarily mean arm strength isn't an issue. could be overcompensating. if you have to exert more effort into a throw you'll tend to be less accurate in general.
Saints,3589kq,dean815,3,Fri May 8 12:33:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the share  Great info
Saints,3589kq,KTDL,3,Fri May 8 01:14:59 2015 UTC,Inaccuracy wasn't his problem last year. Interceptions at the worst times were. Hopefully we'll have better O-line play and improved running game so that he isn't in position to have to make as many pressured throws this year.
Saints,3589kq,Phunkatron,1 point,Fri May 8 16:16:00 2015 UTC,That seems to be the game plan

Saints,3575xy,Saints2Death,3,Thu May 7 17:53:01 2015 UTC,Fuck we really could have used him as a guard
Saints,3575xy,Im_Daydrunk,2,Thu May 7 17:57:22 2015 UTC,He didn't want to play guard. He was dead set on playing tackle and Dallas probably said alright to that.
Saints,3575xy,batmanisfiya,1 point,Thu May 7 22:48:12 2015 UTC,He has probably more of a chance at playing guard there though from what I though.

I agree there has been a lot about him but he was a prospect for us in theory. I also agree there should probably be no more posts from here on about La'el because any correlation with him and the saints are likely over though."

Offseason topics can be a little more liberal since we're dealing with fewer stories coming out, even less so in the realm of just our team.  However, if there are multiple reports sent to us about posts that subscribers feel should not be posted here, then we'll take action. It's kind of one of those things we as mods have to feel out as they happen."

Saints,352z4w,tiger20,2,Thu May 7 15:32:45 2015 UTC,I don't think it's as simple as if we love or hate the Patriots. It all comes down to the integrity of the game. I would hope that any team caught altering such an important piece of the game such as the football would be given the same amount of treatment. I personally have no issue with the Patriots. A lot of the system they implement was picked up by Coach Payton and we practice it here. You have to look beyond fandom and try to be unbiased.
Saints,352z4w,flexormanica,4,Thu May 7 16:32:25 2015 UTC,My point is that this isn't a major infraction.  Literally every QB that plays football has a preferential PSI.  This is the NFL's fault for not doing a better job of checking this themselves IMO.
Saints,352z4w,tiger20,3,Thu May 7 16:50:40 2015 UTC,"I agree. And like the Saints were the sacrificial lamb for pay for performance, the Patriots will be for ball PSI. A new system will be put in place as a result of this, but there will be disciplinary action to make an example of them."

Saints,352z4w,masterdebater88,1 point,Wed May 6 22:48:24 2015 UTC,It's cheating. It may not give a huge competitive advantage but it still was enough for him to risk breaking the rules and looking like an ass-clown.
Saints,352z4w,Big-Zoo,7,Wed May 6 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"No it's not. Rodgers purposely over inflates the balls he plays with. No one is making a big deal about that. If it made that much of a difference, the NFL wouldn't let the teams have their own sets."
Saints,352z4w,Jesus_Oregon,2,Thu May 7 00:04:20 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but I'd have to respectfully disagree.  Regardless of how big or little an impact this action had on the overall game, you are altering its integrity. You can't deny that. If the Falcons get a draft pick taken away next year for pumping in crowd noise, then the Patriots deserve at least that much of a punishment, if not more.  I won't even try to compare it to BountyGate because I don't want to open that can of worms."
Saints,352z4w,phargle,0,Thu May 7 16:23:24 2015 UTC,the competitive advantage is enough though.  the pats have the least amount of fumbles since 2010 by over %50 less than the league average.  2010 is the yr the rules changed where teams could use their own balls.  the two players that lobbied for this rule change were tom brady and peyton manning.  considering we got our head coach suspended for a yr over something that was irrelevant to on the field competition i think as troy ackemen stated that this is much more serious than bountygate.

Saints,352z4w,PHDirty,2,Thu May 7 03:06:51 2015 UTC,100% agree.
Saints,352z4w,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Thu May 7 15:30:13 2015 UTC,I'm calling for blood because if we have multiple fan bases upset with how things are run then public opinion will turn in our favor on these issues.  Would a suspension lasting more than 2-4 games be overkill? Certainly. But that's what we need to show everyone that Goodell is out of control and needs to be removed.
Saints,352z4w,dolodip,0,Thu May 7 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as hypocrisy I see it as sticking to the precedent set by the Saints' penalties. There the entire organization was penalized for what seems to have been a common scheme that likely didn't result in a direct competitive advantage. Peyton lost a year because he didn't cooperate with the investigation and because he lied. The Saints lost draft picks and were fined essentially for what amounted to ""lack of institutional control.""  Here there was a scheme that may have resulted in a direct competitive advantage and -- even if it didn't -- was squarely against the rules. That's why they did it secret -- they knew it was against the rules. And Brady didn't cooperate with the investigation and apparently lied to investigators.   So there needs to be commensurate penalties. Suspend Brady for a year? Ridiculous. But 2-4 games? Yeah, maybe. Take the Patriots' first round draft picks next year? Probably not. But a third to a fifth? Yeah, maybe."
Saints,352z4w,colby347_1,3,Thu May 7 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"I can understand sticking to a precedent if it's a good precedent. No one here thinks the bounty punishment was a good precedent.

I don't keep an NFL rule book, it probably wouldn't fit in my house, so I'll go with what he said. If that's the case that should be the fine.   Why have a rule book with pre-defined penalties if Goodell is allowed to ignore it whenever he wants? The rule book should not apply to only one group of people in an organization."
Saints,352z4w,haledann,0,Fri May 8 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not calling for blood because of the extremely slim advantage they gained. I'm calling for blood because Goodell can't pick and choose when he wants to administer punishment. I want consistency.  Personally, I don't really care much about some under inflated balls. But it does give more of a competitive advantage than bounties. I do agree though that it really isn't worthy of the amount of coverage it's getting. It will just piss me off if one team gets away with something while another team gets nailed to the wall.  That being said, I also can't give much credence to your ""vote with your wallet"" solution. Sure, I avoid supporting the NFL any chance I get (counterfeit jerseys, not subscribing to the NFL network and other trivial things), but even if every Saints fan stopped watching the NFL and buying saints gear, it still wouldn't change what needs to be changed.  Goodell will remain commissioner because the owners want him to. I mean, look how he has mishandled almost every single issue that's come to his desk. And still, the owners aren't doing anything about it.   I'd love to be optimistic and think that if I avoid buying my Keenan Lewis jersey, and stop watching football on Sunday's that I'm sending a message to the NFL that Goodell must go. But honestly, that's just not how it's gonna go down."
Saints,352z4w,whodat951,2,Fri May 8 00:51:20 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree with wanting consistency. However, consistently bad is not what I want.   A lot of people dislike Goodell, not just Saints fans. I guarantee you that ownership knows this. So why is he still there? Record revenue. The owners are making money hand over fist.   Withhold our money is the only way we as fans really have of expressing our displeasure in a meaningful way. Is it wishful thinking? Probably. Football is America's crack, and we'll get our fix regardless."

They take our money and make terrible decisions with it and we just have to watch it happen.         $ > PR  Oh well, I'll just keep smoking the crack and hope we dodge the next bullet that moron named Goodell fires."

ESPN isn't getting trashed by all networks 24/7 bc of other slimey networks corrupt connections.  Fox news is just picked on constantly from all other networks bc Obama's literal national security advisors twin brother isn't the actual current CEO of them like at other national news networks.... So of course they all hate it.  They aren't literally running it.

Saints,352sty,makeplayz,6,Wed May 6 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"I never down voted you.  Because I do see it as a good point. The view of Drew has changed lately though. When we were winning, he was listed as ""he makes everyone better. "" we start losing, and now he's getting old. We got rid of Jimmy, but now he's listed as not having anyone to throw to.   Romo on the other hand has looked middle of the road at times but still gets listed in the ""elite"" status according to pundits. I see him above middle of the road, but not elite yet.   I really just wanted to vent about the way ESPN has been making Drew's age a big concern, yet nothing was made of some of the other aging qbs. This was not a slight to Romo or other fan bases."

Saints,353jsn,quantumhed,12,Wed May 6 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of that stems from the fact that tackles are paid much more than guards. After three years of playing for cheap, its understandable that Collins will want to make as much as possible when he finals gets a real contract. The Saints however, could offer tackle money for him to play guard, as we have done in the past (see cap hits of Grubbs and Evans), and make this a non issue for him. I still like our chances."
Saints,353jsn,whodat951,4,Wed May 6 21:18:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's obvious that we pay our OLs very well.
Saints,353jsn,whodat951,4,Wed May 6 21:26:02 2015 UTC,As we should. It's clear that Brees is at his best behind a solid line (as is the case with every quarterback). Lets hope La'el wants to bring out the best in his favorite player.

Though I'm glad he seems to be changing his mind.  I can't imagine losing a year of football would help him.  He can still train, but getting actual reps in practice and games is invaluable.  Hopefully he realizes that and we can sign him."
Saints,353jsn,ShrimpSandwich1,10,Wed May 6 21:24:34 2015 UTC,"Actually I think if you go undrafted, you are no longer qualified for the any draft in the future. If he had been drafted and then refused to sign then he would have been eligible. That's my understanding."

Saints,3575yz,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Thu May 7 18:35:32 2015 UTC,"Why start? So you can prove you deserve a big contract once the time comes.  Also, I think they locked up their LT for the foreseeable future, so his best bet is to get the RT position. Smiths contract is up in 3 years, whereas their LT just signed a 5 year deal.(I believe. Not positive)"

But as a player, I'd want to go somewhere that guarantees a starting position, so if jerry did say that, I could understand Collins' reasoning."

Saints,35116p,Number-91,13,Wed May 6 05:21:21 2015 UTC,Why are most of /r/NFL saying we will have a losing record?
Saints,35116p,ahungrybatman,26,Wed May 6 05:46:52 2015 UTC,Because we had a losing record last season and the biggest headline we made in the offseason was losing Jimmy Graham. It's no wonder people who don't know the team as well as us think we'll be bad. I wouldn't want it any other way. I love being the underdog.
Saints,35116p,Jaime-Foxx,20,Wed May 6 06:23:28 2015 UTC,r/NFL has always been higher on Graham than most Saints fans.
Saints,35116p,thatEhden,26,Wed May 6 11:24:11 2015 UTC,"Only when it's convenient. I saw nothing but trash talk about him and his piss poor blocking and suddenly when we trade him away, he was our greatest asset outside of brees."
Saints,35116p,disconathan,10,Wed May 6 12:38:27 2015 UTC,"I agree. All I remember was people calling him soft. Lets see who misses who more, Graham in Seattles offensive scheme, or the Saints offense that has continually been consistently in the top 10/5 for the last decade.... Hmm...i'll be very surprised if he manages a 1000 yard season."
Saints,35116p,VegasSaint9,4,Wed May 6 13:34:05 2015 UTC,He only got a 1000 yards twice with us. I really doubt it.
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,3,Wed May 6 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"I think he will post about 800 yds, but the red zone is where they will use him the most to me. I can see upwards of 12 tds easily"
Saints,35116p,humanlikenick,3,Wed May 6 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"Kinda funny how that works, right? Saints fans who point out his weaknesses get piled on. But Seattle fans laud the trade. I don't get it, man."
Saints,35116p,Megawatts19,4,Wed May 6 13:38:45 2015 UTC,no kidding. I even saw a Seahawks fan try to defend his blocking and say he had made massive improvements. These were the same people that laughed at us when we said he was getting better at blocking.

Saints,35116p,mankstar,5,Wed May 6 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"Because /r/NFL doesn't like us, and we didn't do anything flashy. Saints fans and football fans that know the weaknesses of our team kinda see our draft as very solid in filling needs, but we didn't sign any huge name, flashy rookies. Which, the general fans over at /r/NFL see as a negative. I am ecstatic that we didn't trade up in the first and second round. We also took a player at every other position of need while some other teams completely disregarded their needs."
Saints,35116p,Megawatts19,4,Wed May 6 13:37:03 2015 UTC,"The o-line wasn't that bad. We bolstered it anyway, By trading for C Max Ungar and adding Stanford man Andrus Peat(still don't know where he is playing).  Kenny didn't really regress, he played a completely different position in 2014 than in 2013, and just played poorly as a full time in the box safety. Hopefully he will move back.  We loss Sproles and didn't really replace him so Brees forced more passes without a reliable check-down. The addition of Spiller will alleviate the amount of forced passes Brees throws.   We went into the season with White and Robinson as the #2&3 corner. We have since gotten rid of them and add Browner, Breaux, Williams and  Swann, not to mention we still have Dixon and Fredereck, who stepped up last year. SJB will also finally see the field.   With Vaccaro no-longer at his 2013 hybrid role we actually had to rely on our LB to cover RBs and TEs. Either way we replaced Lofton with Ellerbe and Anthony.   The only thing that bugs me going into the season is that our NT situation hasn't really improved. Ellerbe and Anthony should definitely help but I'm not so confident in our run defense.  I'm am excited for Tyeler Davison, hope he can be an impact as a rookie."
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,7,Wed May 6 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"Actually with Vaccaro, it was the opposite. His rookie year he played hybrid, last year he played 2 deep S.   And the o-line was that bad"
Saints,35116p,makeplayz,0,Wed May 6 15:59:48 2015 UTC,We had a top ten offensive line last year.
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,6,Wed May 6 16:04:19 2015 UTC,"PFF has us 11th, but our pass blocking was horrendous. Especially the interior. Especially in situations where we needed to maintain possession. Especially early in games in which the score was tied or we were losing by 7 or less."
Saints,35116p,makeplayz,3,Wed May 6 16:09:50 2015 UTC,It was that bad. Brees was sacked more times the last two years than at any point over his tenure as a saint. Kenny graded out as the 2nd worst safety by PFF in 2014. He went from 3 missed tackles in 2013 to 19 in 2014.
Saints,35116p,quantumhed,1 point,Wed May 6 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"We went from having a top three line to having a top 10 line,  outside of PT none of our feature backs can pick up a block, and Brees lost his check down in Sproles, so he held onto the ball longer. The line overall isn't that bad and better than most other teams, even more so when you compensate for the two games Armstead went down in the first quarter.  In 2013 we started  Charles Brown at LT for most of  the season. You are not wrong.   Kenny missed a lot of tackles."
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,2,Wed May 6 17:34:48 2015 UTC,"I think John Jenkins can be a lot better. He basically missed an entire year recovering from a pectoral tear. Which it's hard to imagine coming back from that and being able to play in the trenches at all. With him having a full offseason to train instead of rehabbing, I think he can make a jump this year. Between him and Davidson, I think they can handle the NT duties. I do hope one of the UDFA D-linemen we picked up will be a gem though. We need depth big time.   EDIT: wording."
Saints,35116p,evtine,1 point,Thu May 7 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"The oline was that bad. Brees was constantly under pressure which forced him to throw the ball too soon causing turnovers.  Goodwin, Grubbs and Evans weren't good.   Kenny V did regress. Yes he was utilized differently but he was constantly out of position. The play where the 49ers completed a 4th and long was solely on him not picking up his assignment. He also missed a bunch of tackles and took poor routes.   The loss of Sproles was found to be a bigger loss than I thought. I agree. Brees needed that security blanket. Spiller will definitely help."
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,3,Wed May 6 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"Kenny V did regress. Yes he was utilized differently but he was constantly out of position. The play where the 49ers completed a 4th and long was solely on him not picking up his assignment.   Except Humbar vacated his zone to cover Gore and abandoned Davis. Dixon was about to and supposed to pick Gore up but ends up covering no one, after letting Lloyd push him way to deep and has to sprint across the field too late to get Crabtree. White also could have picked up Davis but decides to just jog underneath Crab until after Vacarro has made his decision, a decision he shouldn't have had to make. I'm not  forgetting our pass rush just gave up on the play too. Video.  To say that that is solely Vaccaro's fault is not true at all."

Saints,35116p,flordeliest,1 point,Wed May 6 16:56:25 2015 UTC,Humber has to cover Gore because Lofton rolled along with the QB instead of switching off. White's responsibility seems to be Davis at that time. Kenny decided to come up and play Davis when his responsibility was to play deep. If you look as Bush he played it correctly.
Saints,35116p,thatEhden,1 point,Wed May 6 16:55:23 2015 UTC,"Lofton is spying Keapernick he is never in coverage. At 53-57 seconds you can see that Humbar pick Gore over Davis and follows him far to long into Dixon's zone. Dixon did let Lloyd push him way to deep and ends up covering no one.  White should have picked up Davis at this point and just jogs between the two.  It doesn't matter if Vaccaro chose to stay deep or not both Davis and Crab are past the first down maker. This is a lot of peoples' fault, not just  Vaccaro's."
Saints,35116p,flordeliest,2,Wed May 6 17:24:15 2015 UTC,"Even if other players were at fault, Kenny was out of position at the end of the day and was the one who left Crabtree wide open when his assignment was to play deep. Which goes in hand with my original statement that he regressed. I am pretty sure he ranked one of the worst safeties last year according to PFF"
Saints,350gpa,LordSwoledemort,20,Wed May 6 02:01:42 2015 UTC,"Here is a brief analysis of the rise of smaller, quicker WRs I posted a little while back.   That said, I do still find the Saints receiving corps more than a little underwhelming. I've been hard pressed to find a group with less proven talent in the NFL. With a veteran presence in Colston, rising talent in Cooks, and a lot of raw talent to develop, I'm prone to think the FO is very aware of the situation and thinks one or more of these guys can make it happen.   Part of the draw to this strategy for me is to potentially win with the guys that history says you can't win with. Getting back to our roots and winning with the guys who have been with the team even through their struggles. I'd rather win games with a guy we stuck with than a random free agent at the end of the day.   Fuck the falcons"
Saints,350gpa,dean815,4,Wed May 6 03:46:26 2015 UTC,"The FO seems completely sold on Nick Toon, a guy that has been vilified more than once in his tenure with the Saints. I don't know what he's going to brig, and I don't know if Brandon Coleman will be a contributor this year. With Drew under center, I like our chances to get it done in the passing game, though. Perhaps this year we'll use the running game to open up the passing game and not vice versa."
Saints,350gpa,Megawatts19,2,Wed May 6 13:41:07 2015 UTC,I have to assume that is the thinking.

His numbers was just as good or better than Travis Kelce's, who is a monster. He'll be good money in the redzone.   Also Colston, Toon, Jones, and Coleman are all on the better side of 6'3"".

He looked way better in '14, but even still I don't know if I would trust him yet. Now we have Morgan, so at least we have someone to blow the top off if needed."

He's a football player, so he will go across the middle and sacrifice his body for the catch which is something I never really saw jimmy do.   Of course he has to work on his catching and route running, but he's a better football player than Jimmy is in my opinion.   Feel free to downvote me to hell."

Saints,350gpa,smokeajay,3,Wed May 6 02:19:55 2015 UTC,Stills was decent at best until Brees turned him into a 900 yard receiver. Or offense has never been based on any singular receiving threat. And you also forgot Hill.

Saints,350gpa,makeplayz,3,Thu May 7 00:19:50 2015 UTC,"If Brees can make Lance Moore and Robert Meachem look viable, he can probably do the same with some of the players we already have on the roster."
Saints,350gpa,sfzen,3,Wed May 6 15:22:33 2015 UTC,"We don't need a star WR corps. Look at our receivers the past decade or so: Graham has been a monster the last three years, but was a massive cap problem. Colston is in decline, but even in his peak, he would have been a 1a at best on most other teams. Meachem and Moore? They lasted one season on other teams and saw their stats drop drastically. Henderson couldn't even land another NFL job. Drew Brees can turn any receiver into a star, so there isn't a need to invest heavily in the position and Loomis and Payton know that.  Our best offensive years have always been hurt by our defense, and they realized that and have done a lot this offseason to improve our defense. We've also been at our best when Brees is protected and we pair with him with a good running game, which have also been majorly upgraded from last season to this one.   If you look at one of the models of consistent success in the current era, the Patriots, they rarely invest in receivers and RBs because they know that Tom Brady can make any Joe Schmoe better. I think our FO has realized this and are trying to improve our D so Drew doesn't have to constantly put the team on his back, and clearly protecting him is a priority (Peat and Unger.)"
Saints,350gpa,GenrlWashington,2,Wed May 6 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think Toon will be decent at WR3. He's not going to break any records, but he could be a solid contributor. I actually excited to see what we got with Jones and Coleman. If one of them learned how to catch, it will be exciting."
Saints,350gpa,sophandros,1 point,Wed May 6 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"Coleman, I'm praying. I was so excited about him as a PS player. I'm hoping he has a significant role this year. He was moved up to the active roster and I remember seeing him on the field, but I honestly don't recall him catching anything."
Saints,350gpa,krazy9000,2,Wed May 6 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"I'd like an upgrade (Oakland cut James Jones and he's exactly who I would go after for the right price), but I think we'll be alright.  Colston is still a good WR, even though he struggled last year. Cooks was great before his injury, he'll be solid in the slot and has the speed to do well on the outside too. I don't know what to expect from Joe Morgan, but he showed flashes of greatness before, and if he can get his head right, he can be our deep threat. Toon has been steadily improving as a big possession WR and looks ready to make an impact. Saunders looks like he can be a decent backup slot WR, Coleman has all of the size you could ask for if he could just stop dropping the ball, and I don't know enough about Seantavius Jones to comment other than that I've heard good things about his progress. And we've always got Andy Tanner on the roster bubble to come in and work his ass off.  Don't forget Hill looked solid last year at TE, so while losing Graham is a big hit, I think we'll be ok there too."
Saints,350gpa,makeplayz,2,Wed May 6 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not really worried in the least. I think it was more important this off season to strengthen our O-line. (As far as offense goes. Obviously defense was a big worry too.) If we have a solid pocket and Brees has time to find the open guy, and let out an accurate ball, he has the potential to make a star out of anyone on the team. I blame a lot of our passing problems last year on the massive amounts of consistent pressure Brees had to endure to get a pass off.   Colston is getting old, but he's still an above average WR. He'll be fine, though he might drop a ball here and there.  If Cooks comes out the gate like he did last year I will have every bit of confidence in his ability to make the necessary plays.  Morgan, Coleman, and Toon are only average, but I still think they would see improved numbers with the benefits that come from a stronger pocket around the QB.  As far as TE goes I haven't been worried at all.  I think Hill can put up 80% of what Jimmy did pretty easy. Nobody looks at Hill like they did Jimmy either, so he's going to get a lot of plays off of that.  As someone else mentioned I think both Watson and Hill are both better blockers than Jimmy was as well. Another point that will be critical in moving the offense like we want.  Then you have, again as someone mentioned, C.J. Spiller. Who will basically fit a role that was lost when Sproles left.  When all is said and done though, with Spiller, Robinson, and Ingram, and the hints from Payton during the off-season about the best Saints team also had an excellent running game, I am pretty sure we are going to have some focus on making that work as well.  We picked up a number of guys that should be able to help our O-line protect, and open up lanes for RBs, and I think we are going to see a  pretty even variation of plays.  Unless someone can step up and show they are capable I don't think we are going to see nearly as much long ball as we have in the past. This may be a good thing though, as it may keep Brees' arm healthier, longer, with him not having to lob Hail Mary's constantly. And hopefully with the improvements we are trying to make we won't have to worry about making those 3rd and long big plays as often."
Saints,350gpa,aimerj,1 point,Wed May 6 08:49:56 2015 UTC,"If Hill produces 75% of what Jimmy does, he's ~900 yards and ~10 TDs.  I'll gladly take that."
Saints,350gpa,pottersquash,1 point,Wed May 6 16:06:36 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about Jalen Saunders. This dude was a 4th round pick just last year. He's got a skill set very similar to Kenny stills, and he not afraid of contact over the middle. He had one measly catch last year, but when you think about it, it's kind of amazing he got on the field at all on offense considering we didn't even pick him up until the end of November. Our offense had proven to have a steep learning curve, especially for young wrs. So it says something about his ability to pick things up pretty fast. I think, given an entire off-season with us, this dude will surprise a lot of people.   We also brought Joe Morgan back who is a proven deep threat when he's not being a fuck up."

For months there's been some deal with the dude that has threatened his status with the team. It's bad enough to get him kicked off, but not bad enough for him to be given a second chance. The insinuation is that the fanbase can't handle whatever is going on with him, which is laughable.  I assume he either has a huge drinking problem or narcolepsy, which - really - who cares. The local press need to stop treating Morgan like he's an X-File."

Saints,34yx42,jakeleo90,-4,Tue May 5 22:08:17 2015 UTC,"... who's talking about the team investigating anything? Obviously a sportswriter would report it, not the team. I feel you guys are all being intentionally obtuse.  Let me try it another way. Do you guys not get asked about Saints players from fans of other teams? When somebody asks me what the deal is with Morgan all you can say is, ""Well, nobody really knows. People make assumptions but there's no facts. He's had a vague black cloud over him for a year.""   That's dumb. This is the entertainment industry, he's not Nobby Nobody down at the docks. It's OK for some sportswriter to state what the issue is on him getting yo-yoed around. In fact, it'd be better for him because it would end speculation. It's been going on for over a year, enough already. If he has a crippling problem with gin then great, I finally have something in common with a Saints player. Maybe we'll wake up in the same alley and I'll just ask him."

Obviously the organization knows what they are and how to deal with them or else he wouldn't still be on the team. The front office really doesn't need to blare out his personal issues to everyone else since that really doesn't benefit anyone. He's not a big free agent. No other team is going to look at taking him, and even they did he wouldn't be anything more than a camp body.  At this point the organization has made it pretty clear they aren't going to tell the public what his issues are. Do I want to know what they are? Yes. Am I going to investigate despite the organization not talking about it? No. There's no reason to deface the guy if the team thinks he can overcome it and have a 2nd chance. Ultimately all we can do is hope he figures this out, both for the team's sake and his own."

Saints,34ykat,FKA_Mousecop,3,Wed May 6 06:57:29 2015 UTC,I'm hoping his QB hits lead us to more turnovers. I was so upset watching game after game last year and seeing almost no turnovers.

Saints,34xf1l,armelgibson,13,Tue May 5 10:46:49 2015 UTC,My guess is we keep Griffin and Grayson. McCown is 33 and Griffin/Grayson are better Backups for longterm.
Saints,34xf1l,hrafnass,5,Tue May 5 10:56:49 2015 UTC,Agree
Saints,34xf1l,blueboybob,20,Tue May 5 11:55:30 2015 UTC,What will be our QBs
Saints,34xf1l,makeplayz,7,Tue May 5 13:00:06 2015 UTC,"I think that due to age, McCown will be out. I wish him well. Griffin will be the second string and Grayson will be the young padawan learning the ropes."
Saints,34xf1l,baconlovr,3,Tue May 5 14:20:08 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think McCown gets kept as backup in case Brees gets injured. Griffin gets displaced with Grayson in as the project.  All of this is pending training camp, where things tend to sort themselves out."
Saints,34xf1l,cfiggis,2,Tue May 5 20:08:59 2015 UTC,i also think Griffin and Grayson will never be starter for us (exception would be brees hurt/retires next at the end of his current contract - i hope both will not happen). We will draft brees replacement later.
Saints,34xf1l,hrafnass,1 point,Tue May 5 18:05:57 2015 UTC,Qui-Gon -> Obi -> Ani right? We are breeding the next Vader in Grayson.
Saints,34xf1l,xbaited,3,Tue May 5 14:41:05 2015 UTC,Grayson wins a ring with ATL then is defeated by an upstart unknown Saints QB in the NFC championship the next year. Where the Saints go on to defeat the Pats because we all know BB is the Emperor.
Saints,34xf1l,johall,2,Tue May 5 15:12:02 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call Brees Qui-Gon. He seems more like Yoda to me with some of the crap he's pulled off over the years.
Saints,34xf1l,hryfrcnsnnts,5,Thu May 7 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"Brees, McCown, Grayson. If Griffin had been able to win the backup job, McCown would have been gone a long time ago.  I also think it's possible that we go with 2 QB's, in which case it would be Brees and Grayson."
Saints,34xf1l,sfzen,1 point,Tue May 5 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"Hoping it will be Brees, Griffin, Grayson. We just signed McCown to a 1.1 mil 1 yr contract in January, which looks pretty silly after drafting Grayson since we gave McCown 350,000 guaranteed. Hoping we just cut our losses since we need the roster depth a lot more at other positions (seems like we're going to carry a lot of LB and DB). They might leave Griffin or Grayson on the practice squad this year since Luke is the only one who really has any game experience."
Saints,34xf1l,dean815,2,Tue May 5 14:43:15 2015 UTC,I don't think Grayson goes to practice squad because then another team could sign him to their roster.   Also griffin was on the active roster for 11 games so he might not be eligible for the PS. I think he gets released and we keep McCown as our backup and Grayson as a project (for now) QB.
Saints,34xf1l,Cal00,1 point,Tue May 5 16:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we even eventually signed Griffin to our active roster to protect him from St. Louis when they were in need. Grayson was ranked a lot higher than Griffin. He'll be on the roster, definitely."
Saints,34xf1l,cfiggis,1 point,Tue May 5 20:06:40 2015 UTC,McCown and Griffin both get cut
Saints,34xf1l,Phunkatron,1 point,Tue May 5 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Brees will start. :)  After him, it's up to whether we keep two or three backups."
Saints,34xf1l,sophandros,1 point,Tue May 5 15:34:07 2015 UTC,"My vote is drop McCown he's getting older and isn't really high enough caliber to make this a moot discussion.  Keep Griffin and Grayson, let them duke it out in preseason and let's see if Grayson can be a decent guy. If he is give him the #2 spot and let him learn."
Saints,34xf1l,Mudkipz137,1 point,Tue May 5 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think this is the year we push into the playoffs. And with that said, I think we keep experience on the sideline under Brees. So we're looking at Brees/McCown/Grayson. Grayson learns from Brees and studies with McCown."
Saints,34xf1l,hryfrcnsnnts,1 point,Thu May 7 16:44:37 2015 UTC,My guess is we get keep McCown. Why have two project QBs with zero experience?
Saints,34xf1l,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue May 5 15:43:36 2015 UTC,I agree with this. People don't realize how important a backup qb can be with preparation and film work.
Saints,34xf1l,evtine,2,Tue May 5 17:20:25 2015 UTC,And what value does Griffin really bring with Grayson on the roster? McCown brings years of experience.

Saints,34w28u,Jwhite985,8,Tue May 5 01:03:14 2015 UTC,"I actually really love our draft. According to the projections we might have ""reached"" on players, but the players that we did get are almost all going to contribute IMO. Every single pick addressed a need, even the Grayson one. I was never convinced that Griffin was the future, so if they were really in love with him I like the pick. The only questionable pick to me was the DB from Georgia, but if they liked him enough to move up I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I can't freaking wait until preseason to see how this all plays out. I think Anthony is going to be a stud for us."
Saints,34w28u,Lokipokie504,4,Tue May 5 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"I think Peat and Anthony are going to be stellar (I wanted Shelton, but we know how that went).  I don't mind the Grayson pick.  He most likely would have gone off the board between our 3rds.  If they think of him in the same vein as Garoppolo, then I support his development.  I'm concerned about Kikaha's knee.  Injury is also in the back of my mind with Tull thanks to the combine hamstring and subsequent shoulder surgery (not to mention the broken leg that made him a Moc).  I think Davison was value.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he brings to the table.  I don't understand trading up for another CB.  I thought we adequately addressed this in the off-season, but I won't complain about improving the odds in that area.  I would have preferred a WR somewhere late, but Brees (nuff said)."
Saints,34w28u,sart0rial,6,Tue May 5 07:47:15 2015 UTC,"Kikaha's knee was torn in 2011 I believe. It hasn't bothered him lately obviously, as evidenced by his sack numbers. PJ Williams was definitely a BPA pick. He would've been at least a 3rd round pick if it wasn't for the DUI. He will battle for at least a nickel or dime spot. He's tough as nails and a competitor."
Saints,34w28u,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue May 5 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"He tore it in 2011 and again in 2012.  He has two full seasons after the second, so my concern is a bit unwarranted.  I tend to hold my breath every time someone with multiple injury history makes contact and sigh in relief when they get up (friggin Bush)."
Saints,34w28u,sart0rial,2,Tue May 5 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"I heard he might be best suited for S, which doesn't make sense because we have like 6 already lol"

Saints,34w28u,bhsfb33,6,Tue May 5 01:42:28 2015 UTC,You're allowed to say that here
Saints,34w28u,flexormanica,2,Tue May 5 03:41:36 2015 UTC,I've heard hugely differing stories on Anthony. Some people say he was the best ILB in the draft and some say he was a huge reach. Is there any indication? Is he like a Mosley or Mack? or are does it look bad to have traded Graham for Unger and Anthony right now?
Saints,34w28u,theultimatehero2,6,Tue May 5 04:42:56 2015 UTC,I think it bodes well that he led the best defensive unit in the nation in tackles.  He's also bigger and faster than the other guy Vitt was on the fence about (Kendricks).
Saints,34w28u,sart0rial,3,Tue May 5 05:40:25 2015 UTC,"A sure-tackling inside linebacker was our biggest need coming into the draft IMO. Anthony's measurables and athleticism are strikingly similar to KC's Derrick Johnson, one of the best 3-4 ILBs in the league. He has shown similar leadership abilities and was a leader on one of the best defenses in the nation."
Saints,34w28u,dean815,3,Tue May 5 07:43:04 2015 UTC,"I think based on his athleticism, and physical attributes alone he's worth a 1st on. 6' 3"" 243lbs and can move? Yes please. I'd prefer him over Hawthorne who is terribly slow. I feel with NFL coaching he could easily become a pro bowler. I don't feel they would've taken someone who wasn't ready to play in the first. I think he'll be a stud, and be our own Bobby Wagner."
Saints,34w28u,VegasSaint9,2,Tue May 5 16:02:13 2015 UTC,"While I love our draft on paper, I'm more concerned about how they pan out.

But the pieces we got SHOULD help us out greatly if they perform to their potential. On paper, it's our best draft since 06 I think."
Saints,34w28u,Briguy_fieri,1 point,Tue May 5 19:12:06 2015 UTC,"He's played two full seasons since his knee injuries, i believe he's fine. If he had a bad year between then, I'd be hesitant, but the fact he came right back into it and played well shows a lot about who he is as a football player."
Saints,34vtz8,GifelteFish,13,Mon May 4 23:53:33 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Browner. That is one of the main reasons we signed him, was to be a leader on that side of the ball. Honorable mention to Keenan Lewis as well."
Saints,34vtz8,baconlovr,8,Tue May 5 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan of making someone a captain when it's his first year on the team, unless it's a QB. I just feel like the captain should be a guy that's been around, has everyone's respect, and knows what the coaches want."
Saints,34vtz8,sfzen,2,Tue May 5 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"Browner kind of is that guy, he's just new to NOLA, but so is most of the defense at this point."
Saints,34vtz8,PatSayJack,1 point,Tue May 5 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"I know he is, and I wouldn't be upset of he's a captain, I just personally put a lot of stock into how long someone has been with the team. Like Strief, Evans, Humber, Colston, etc. I agree we don't have nearly as many of those guys on defense."
Saints,34vtz8,sfzen,2,Tue May 5 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"IMO, our defense is being rebooted and is a clean slate.  Keenan Lewis is the only dude that is untouchable.  Browner is coming in with back to back rings from two different teams and knows way more about winning than anyone else on defense with the exception of Keenan.  He should be captain because he is the example I want the rest of these guys to follow next season.  I want his hard hitting style to set the tone of every defensive snap."
Saints,34vtz8,PatSayJack,3,Tue May 5 18:28:11 2015 UTC,"I'd vote Lewis or Jordan. Captaincy usually goes to an ILB, but I just don't think Hawthorne is really cemented as a starter coming into the season, since Ellerbe and Anthony will be looking to get plenty of snaps."
Saints,34vtz8,sfzen,1 point,Tue May 5 02:22:49 2015 UTC,Jordan or Lewis
Saints,34vtz8,Algiersron,1 point,Tue May 5 03:19:20 2015 UTC,"Out of the two, I'd pick Lewis."

Saints,34vtz8,JUST_ANOTHER_NOBODY,2,Tue May 5 03:00:20 2015 UTC,CB usually aren't captains but I'd have to say it should be either Keenan Lewis or Brandon Browner.
Saints,34vtz8,VegasSaint9,2,Tue May 5 14:00:27 2015 UTC,"Stephone Anthony. He was a leader at Clemson, maybe a leader in the middle of the defense is what we've been missing. I want him to he the QB of the defense.   Brandon Browner, Lewis, Jordan are also solid."

Saints,34vtz8,mes8007,3,Tue May 5 00:30:28 2015 UTC,Junior Galette is already a Captain. I'd say of that group Hawthorne is the most likely.

Saints,34v4dv,asmodeus01,32,Mon May 4 20:34:18 2015 UTC,Pair that with the 13 UDFA signings and the Saints still have one open spot on their roster. Perhaps for a certain first round talent from their home state who is a huge fan of Drew Brees and waiting to clear up a legal situation.

Saints,34v4dv,KarmaPoIice,16,Mon May 4 21:24:56 2015 UTC,The most recent photo on his twitter is from when Drew Brees visited his school when Collins was 12 years old.
Saints,34v4dv,whodat951,3,Mon May 4 21:35:02 2015 UTC,I saw that and it gives me some hope. If we end up making an actual effort to sign this guy I hope Drew is along for the pitch. The addition of Collins to our line would just be an unbelievable pickup

Saints,34v4dv,whodat951,2,Tue May 5 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"Before the draft he kept saying he thought he was a tackle, that he could play tackle in the nfl, and how every nfl scout that talked to him told him he was a tackle. He added that he'd do whatever the team needed him to do, but tackles generally make significantly more than guards and if he can go to a team with very good opportunity to start at tackle, it would seem to me to be a better option considering the depth we have at tackle right now.  Just looking at it from an objective pov. I hope we get him though. It would be awesome if we could put him at LG. Our OL would be so sick."
Saints,34v4dv,ULMmmMMMm,4,Tue May 5 23:45:03 2015 UTC,"Ball is a slight surprise here. I never expected him to make the team, but I thought he would be able to push during training camp. The other two should surprise no one."

Saints,34uzrj,myxanders,8,Mon May 4 20:00:58 2015 UTC,"I can't see us picking up a 36 year old WR, especially when our problems aren't really on that side of the ball. It didn't work for Champ Bailey, it probably won't work for Reggie Wayne. If we do pick up anyone else in the receiving corps, it'll be an undrafted rookie."
Saints,34uzrj,baconlovr,2,Mon May 4 20:08:56 2015 UTC,One Wayne does not equal one Bailey. Someone will pick him up but it won't be us. Colston is enough for a veteran presence.
Saints,34uzrj,paradigmshift7,2,Mon May 4 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"What exactly does he bring to the Saints that is not already on the roster other than experience? Hell, he's a free agent so it's not like he brings over veteran leadership. There's no preexisting relationship with him."
Saints,34uzrj,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 4 20:46:03 2015 UTC,Valid points. I feel like looking at the roster now outside of Colston and Cooks we have no real impact wide receivers and that Wayne has a higher chance to bring that than the rest of the guys listed on our roster right now. This just came to me a while ago and I found it an intriguing thought.
Saints,34uzrj,Saints2Death,2,Mon May 4 21:42:15 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree with you, but I think there's several receivers on the roster right now that could be impact receivers. We know what we got with Morgan, Toon, and Tanner, and if any of them were going to break out, then it probably would have happened by now. But the verdicts still out on Coleman and Jones. I'm excited to see what a year with the Saints have done to improve their play. Jones especially showed some flashes in the preseason."

Saints,34rs8s,cloud9formations,2,Mon May 4 15:24:55 2015 UTC,Film study and play recognition is essential for his position. It gives me hope that he could develop into a very good captain of the defense. Plus he was also a very good leader at Clemson so it looks like he will also bring that to the table.

Saints,34sbuu,dubya_a,3,Mon May 4 03:29:01 2015 UTC,Peat: Fantastic run blocker already. Could use some work in the passing game but we have always been fantastic working with O-line.  Anthony: Leader among men at Clemson. Already an improvement over what we have and I am confident he will anchor the middle (hopefully) for years to come. He is also a big man and LBs transition fairly well from college. Only worry is our LB coaches..  PJ Williams: The guy dropped because of the off field stuff. Borderline first talent and we have two fantastic corners to teach him how to mature. I'm confident he will pan out even if it's at safety in the future.  Grayson: Payton is a wizard with QBs. 7th round QBs have looked not too bad when brought through our system. 2nd/3rd round talent will be much better. I don't think he'll be as good as Brees as that would be getting way too hopeful. The chances of hitting a HoF QB in the 3rd is minimal but I feel like he can definitely be sustainable in the future.
Saints,34sbuu,ashsky,4,Mon May 4 14:41:49 2015 UTC,"Anthony has the highest ceiling of any our draft picks and really any LB taken in this draft all together. Hopefully, James Willis has more to due with his development than Joe Vitt."
Saints,34sbuu,flordeliest,2,Mon May 4 14:47:44 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Have high hopes for him and he definitely has the ability to become a stud in the league.  My only concern is Joe Vitt..
Saints,34sbuu,ashsky,4,Mon May 4 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"Peat, Anthony, Kikaha, and Williams. Watch out for Marcus Murphy too, dude is a beast in the return game. I made highlights of them it's here on reddit or http://youtu.be/P96eXwdXF0M"
Saints,34sbuu,Easybrees009,2,Mon May 4 03:56:06 2015 UTC,"Peat, Anthony, Grayson, williams"
Saints,34sbuu,dean815,2,Mon May 4 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'll say Peat, Anthony, Davison and Williams. Kikaha was very productive in college, but watching his tape it doesn't seem to match the kind of elite sack production that he had, so I think he could struggle at the next level facing much better competition in better offensive linemen and QBs with much greater awareness and ability to avoid sacks. Most QBs taken outside the first two rounds don't pan out, so that's why I'll say Grayson won't pan out as if he was someone who legitimately be a starter, a team with greater need at QB would have taken him earlier, and really when you look at his stats playing in a weak conference in college with a great WR to throw to, you'd hope he would be tearing it up in college a bit more against weaker competition. As for Tull, Swann and Murphy, I have nothing against these guys, but again law of averages says a lot of later round picks don't work out. Think Swann could be a solid depth corner for a while, but don't see anything in his tape that suggests he'll be more than that, although he could still develop into something more. Murphy seems like he was probably picked more for his returning ability than his running ability, although the Saints have a great track with finding good running backs as UDFAs so if they wanted to take him with their last pick in the draft they probably see some potential in him to be a dynamic player. Don't want to bet against him, but again if we're going by the law of averages I'll say he stays around for a bit as a STs guy and depth RB but eventually gets replaced (similar to Cadet's role I guess). I like the Tull pick and think he has good potential for a fifth rounder, but it comes down again to how many freak athletes you see especially at the pass rusher position who just don't translate that athleticism into production on the field (good example of this from a past Saint is Martez Wilson). But I think Peat and Anthony could both be long time starters. Davison is a guy with great strength and versatility along the defensive line so I think he'll at least be a solid rotational guy along the DL who can help stop the run and try to collapse the pocket. Williams I think could be a solid CB, he'll probably compete for snaps in the nickel spot this year and could learn well from Lewis and Browner which could benefit his development moving forward."
Saints,34sbuu,Hedgery,0,Mon May 4 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"I'm also not sold on Ki'kaha, he was considered a 2nd round pick until the combine exposed that he isn't that athletic and he fell to the 4th. He isn't big or long, he certainly isn't fast,  he isn't particularly strong,  he doesn't bend well,  he isn't versatile at all. I don't see why anyone would expect him to produce what he did in college in the NFL. Our worst pick considering how much of a reach it was. I do hope I'm wrong and he beats out Haralson for the starting position."
Saints,34sbuu,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 4 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, these are my thoughts exactly. From what I've seen on film, I don't really expect his pass rushing to translate very well at all to the NFL level since a lot of his sacks seemed to be coverage sacks or a product of bad college QBs holding on to the ball to long, and many of the sacks seemed like the type that many NFL QBs would avoid easily. He doesn't have the size, speed or technique from what I see to be a solid pass rusher in the NFL, and he isn't good in coverage or against the run either. Think he could be a complete bust, and if the Saints really wanted a pass rusher in the 2nd round with the risk of being a bust, I'd have rather they took a shot on Gregory, because at least the talent is there with him, and the risk of him being a bust is off-field issues not a question of on-field ability. Like you said, hope I'm wrong and he is a great addition to this defense, but just don't see it. Had him as a 4th or 5th round guy, huge reach in the 2nd."
Saints,34sbuu,Hedgery,0,Mon May 4 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"The worst part for me is that Kendricks was available and I don't feel like we got any better at stopping the run for the D-line, or got better at coverage as far as our linebackers go."
Saints,34sbuu,flordeliest,1 point,Mon May 4 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Right. Like they had a chance to pick each of my top 3 ILBs (they took Anthony at 31, could've taken Kendricks at 44, and Paul Dawson was available at both their picks in the 3rd round), and they passed on the opportunity to solidify their linebacker position for the foreseeable future with guys who would be great against the run and solid in coverage, but they passed on the chance to get arguably the best LB in the draft in Kendricks, and pass on a great value pick in Dawson in the third. ILB has been a huge weak spot for the Saints since they switched to the 3-4, so I was hoping they'd bring in at least two ILBs."

Clearing the Jimmy Graham deal does that for us, along with all the restructures made to get that deal done. We should have a lot of room next year, depending on how much the cap rises. 3 years from now? Hard to tell, depends on whether they do a big FA signing or two, and to a lesser extent on how much we have to reserve for the annual rookie pool (the more we win, the less goes in the pool).  As far as local deals as a local high school player and LSU guy he would have more doors open to him than most guards would, but New Orleans is still a very small media market so I'm not sure how that parses out.  Competitively he is a clear step above Lelito talent wise, and Jahri is at that stage in his career where he is clearly not getting any better and may be well into decline. Hard to read that with the injuries Jahri has dealt with the last couple of seasons, is it just bad luck and holding him back or are nagging injuries a sign of aging? Either way the Saints have a need for a young talented guard and a history of paying their guards top dollar. That makes NOLA a top 5 destination for Collins imo."

Saints,34sdm3,Hotdog_Skin,2,Mon May 4 05:05:54 2015 UTC,If he wanted to be far from home he probably wouldn't have gone to LSU. I suppose his desire to be away may have changed in the past month or so though.

Saints,34sdm3,harveyfjord,0,Mon May 4 16:49:01 2015 UTC,Well the stuff about him reentering the draft (agent) sounds best if that's even allowed.

Not signing a cheap 2nd chance contract with a team.

Saints,34rpv1,SpaceDeathEvolution,1 point,Mon May 4 02:32:50 2015 UTC,This is an extremely good point. The cowboys struggled for a while but now undoubtedly have the best offensive line in the league.
Saints,34rpv1,cheetah_kibbles,6,Tue May 5 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"I have the same complaint.  I can't disagree with the article. Time will tell, but I hoped for a defensive player with our first pick."
Saints,34rpv1,kweeche,2,Mon May 4 00:39:54 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping Shelton would've been there. After realizing that we weren't going to take Gregory or Ray no matter what, I guess that would've left us with Dupree as the only reasonable choice for a defender at 13. However, I see Dupree as the most hit or miss first round defender in the draft. I've got a lot of faith in this pick."
Saints,34rpv1,Charizard_Targaryen,2,Mon May 4 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"From Payton's comments, it sounded like they would've taken Shelton if he was there. It's rare that you here coaches admit stuff like that, as usually they just try to pump up the guy they picked, but he said that Peat and Shelton were both up there as guys they would take at 13, and I'd assume they would've taken Shelton had he been there based on how much it would help the D. Peat still a solid pick, just won't make an immediate impact unless he beats Armstead or Strief out of their jobs."
Saints,34rpv1,Hedgery,2,Mon May 4 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"I think Armstead is coming along great and shouldn't lose the job to Peat. Streif has been very consistent for us for several years. If Peat beat him for the starting job, I think Streif has too much value to be a backup. He'd probably be traded. The most likely scenario is that Peat uses this year to improve and becomes the starter next year, replacing Streif."
Saints,34rpv1,Charizard_Targaryen,2,Mon May 4 02:54:07 2015 UTC,"I can see how this would be the typical knee-jerk reaction from most ""analysts"", citing that our defense needed the most work. What they fail to see is that we picked up four... FOUR... defensive lineman in this draft. We also got two secondary positions. Six out of nine total draft picks were on defense, but they're only focused on the the first one, which is not a good analysis. Articles like this also fail to mention how well we did in free agency, picking up Browner and Ellerbe, and getting back a healthy Byrd.  But I'm no ""analyst"" so I guess I should believe that only the first draft pick counts and I should base the entire draft on that one pick... ಠ_ಠ"
Saints,34rpv1,baconlovr,2,Mon May 4 14:27:29 2015 UTC,I feel like this is true for most Saints articles.
Saints,34rpv1,PatSayJack,1 point,Mon May 4 19:23:23 2015 UTC,I kinda felt like this when we drafted him... not because I thought we needed a defensive player but I honestly felt we drafted him way too high and coulda traded back with somebody and still picked him up.  Alot of drafts had him going in the late 20's early 2nd round.   Not only that I just don't think he will be quite NFL ready as people think.

Saints,34o4jv,shrike3000,0,Tue May 5 19:11:11 2015 UTC,All we have to do is extend him to get that number down.
Saints,34o4jv,krazy9000,15,Sun May 3 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"Why do we need to get the number down? Extending him will just push the money back to years where he is older. We are in great cap shape next season even with the cap hit, so there's really no reason to touch his contact."
Saints,34o4jv,ToddNew,4,Sun May 3 04:50:00 2015 UTC,100% agree. No reason to extend. Watch what happens to the Cowboys once the 3rd and 4th mortgages come due on Tony Romo. It's gonna be a red wedding.
Saints,34o4jv,shrike3000,0,Sun May 3 14:39:33 2015 UTC,I agree. I said if we wanted to reduce it that's what we would do.
Saints,34o4jv,shrike3000,0,Sun May 3 06:06:20 2015 UTC,Depends on the way the contract is worded.
Saints,34o4jv,shrike3000,1 point,Sun May 3 04:10:56 2015 UTC,Well if we are extending him I guarantee the goal will be to get his current cap hit numbers down.
Saints,34o4jv,ddoggie,-8,Sun May 3 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"Of course that's the goal...But I would wager it's Brees' goal to keep that money coming in since he knows damn well that this is his last shot at a pay day like this. If the Saints had the leverage to make him renegotiate, they most certainly would have this off season, seeing as how we had to practically gut the team to accommodate his enormous salary. Beyond that, I don't see the football sense, financial sense or otherwise in retaining an incredibly overpaid, 38 year old Qb when we have almost no shot of making a serious Super Bowl run."
Saints,34oj7q,atn420,1 point,Sun May 3 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"[Drafting Grayson] will become a risk if this leads to the Saints pushing Brees out the door before his time is up. Brees, 36, has just two years remaining on his current contract, which makes next offseason the natural time for an extension. Do the Saints still do that now that Grayson's in the building?   This seems like a real stretch by Triplett. I can almost guarantee you that Drew and Sean have talked frequently and recently about each party's plans and expectations. The only real risk regarding the Grayson pick is potentially having to pay him in 4 years without ever seeing him play any meaningful football."
Saints,34oj7q,ImShadier,2,Sun May 3 03:00:42 2015 UTC,"The only real risk regarding the Grayson pick is potentially having to pay him in 4 years without ever seeing him play any meaningful football.    True, but if he ends up being solid enough to take over for Drew (I'm not even talking HoF caliber just starter worthy) then he's worth the money. If he turns out to be a star and a qb god, then ya we pay him but we can be happy that it's a smooth transition. Or he becomes decent enough we pay him decent qb money but not drew brees money. Or he turns out to be a backup at best and we invest in a first round qb in one of the upcoming drafts"
Saints,34n44d,CSU_Mike,16,Sat May 2 17:50:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! Most of us are excited to have a great new prospect to study under Brees. He's gonna get some great coaching behind Drew and Payton. Hope it all works out and we have a great QB after Drew retires.

There's no precedent for that but apparently no rule against it. Bo Jackson was drafted by the Bucs but refused to sign. A year later he was drafted by the Raiders. Since Collins wasn't drafted this year, if he were to get drafted next year, it would be a league first.   Edit: apparently I'm wrong. If he were drafted, he could refuse to sign and enter the 2016 draft."
Saints,34o1x0,Cal00,1 point,Sun May 3 01:59:58 2015 UTC,My understanding is he requested that of the NFL and was turned down. I'm expecting that this will all blow over before camps open and he will sign with someone.

Edit: Just read on NFL.com that was his plan, but that it's not an option by NFL rules? Is it because he didn't get drafted that he can't reenter the draft next year? That didn't make sense."
Saints,34o1x0,GenrlWashington,3,Sun May 3 05:25:26 2015 UTC,He requested the NFL allow that and was denied. ProFootballTalk (NBC Sports) said he was doing that to scare teams off drafting him late because if he signs as a UFA he makes more money than as a late round pick and he intends to sign a deal and play this year.
Saints,34o1x0,backgrinder,1 point,Sun May 3 05:55:06 2015 UTC,Okay. That makes a lot more sense than the scattered info I hear/see.

Saints,34o1x0,typical0,2,Sun May 3 10:50:58 2015 UTC,Because he has every plan on playing this season and if a team had drafted him they would control his rights.
Saints,34o1x0,backgrinder,2,Sun May 3 13:16:44 2015 UTC,That isn't what he said though. Now he is ineligible For next years draft and wishes he won't have to sign as udfa.
Saints,34o1x0,typical0,1 point,Sun May 3 17:24:09 2015 UTC,"He can make more money off a UFA contract and hit free agency quicker than he would if he had been a last day draft pick. Not as good as a 1st round deal, but still an opportunity."
Saints,34o1x0,backgrinder,1 point,Mon May 4 03:08:42 2015 UTC,I don't know about the money but it's a 3 year contract
Saints,34o1x0,typical0,2,Mon May 4 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"3 years at league minimum salary (which is what players taken after the 3rd all get), limited signing bonus, and the player can make money from the performance based pay pool (since he is undrafted he gets slotted higher than a drafted player and in theory will earn more, assuming he starts wherever he ends up).  Free agency and extyensions are big advantages too, a drafted player is a restricted free agent after 4 years and eligible for a contract extension after 3. For undrafted players they can be extended after 2 years and become RFA after 3. The restricted offers are the same whether they were drafted or not.   Basically, Collins loses out on signing bonus as compared to a mid-late round pick, but can make more in performance based pay, sign a contract extension earlier or become a free agent earlier. Since the big money for most successful NFL players is the second deal being a UFA is a huge advantage for him."
Saints,34o1x0,backgrinder,1 point,Mon May 4 07:24:34 2015 UTC,Me either.  As far as PR goes all they would have had to say was they were waiting for the legal process to play out and the police have no reason to believe he is guilty of a crime.

Saints,34ng4c,Saints2Death,37,Sat May 2 19:36:55 2015 UTC,Throw enough of them at the wall and see who sticks.
Saints,34ng4c,ImShadier,20,Sat May 2 19:39:47 2015 UTC,"The LB additions seem a little more strategic, but the battle for DB roster spots are going to be epic.  Browner, Lewis, Byrd and Vacarro are all locked as starter. That leaves the nickel corner position open and SJB, Dixon, Fredrick, Wilson, Breaux, Zimmerman, Kenny Phillips, AJ Davis, Bush, Sanford, Warren, Ball, Sunseri and two rookies trying to make the roster."
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,2,Sat May 2 19:49:45 2015 UTC,"My guess is Williams, Fredrick, Dixon, Swann, Bush, Warren, Sunseri, and maybe Breaux make the team. The rest get cut, including SJB.    As far as LBs, Hawthorne is gone if it saves us a decent amount of money. Dude is shit."
Saints,34ng4c,CKitch26,2,Sat May 2 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too certain about Swann. As a Dawgs fan, I've watched him fuck up alot. Also didn't make the improvement that you'd want from junior to senior year"
Saints,34ng4c,jackmuhswag,2,Sun May 3 19:43:18 2015 UTC,Why would we cut SJB if we drafted him as a project player only a year ago
Saints,34ng4c,sophandros,3,Sat May 2 20:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that he's a mistake, but the best teams recognize and admit mistakes earlier rather than later."
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,0,Sun May 3 00:41:26 2015 UTC,Why were 2 guys we picked up off the street weeks before thrown into the game before him? Dude doesn't know how to play corner. Coaching staff did everything within their power to keep him off the field for a reason.
Saints,34ng4c,jackmuhswag,3,Sat May 2 21:31:23 2015 UTC,He wasn't suppose to play at all. He's very raw. He has like a year of experience at corner.
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,1 point,Sat May 2 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"There are 53 roster spots, how many years can you spend one of those spots on someone who cannot contribute? If he doesn't make strides in training camp and preseason, I expect he'll be released. He's looking like he was a mistake, sometimes it's better to cut bait instead of doubling down on the same mistake."
Saints,34ng4c,jackmuhswag,5,Sat May 2 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"I don't get how he's a mistake after only one year. Corner back is one of the hardest positions to transition from college to the nfl. Especially when you have little experience at the position. Do I think SJB should have been taken in the 2nd round, no. I think that he has alot of potential just based off physical attributes, yes."
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,2,Sat May 2 22:19:59 2015 UTC,"I just don't think they expect much of him judging from the fact that we just drafted 2 more corners. We probably only will keep 6 CBs, and 3 are all but locked in with Lewis, Browner, and Williams."
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,1 point,Sat May 2 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he catches on, he has the physical tools to really help this team. I'm just skeptical based on his age (he's already 25) and lack of progression last year. We'll find out in the preseason."
Saints,34ng4c,jackmuhswag,1 point,Sat May 2 23:50:39 2015 UTC,"But I do agree, he might be released due to the amount of competition at that spot."
Saints,34ng4c,AgaliareptX,0,Sun May 3 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Well we just drafted a QB who we know we aren't going to need for at least 2 years, probably more. I think SJB should get longer than a year."
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,1 point,Sat May 2 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"A backup QB is NEVER expected to take the field unless there is an injury. How can you even make that comparison?   We have some defensive packages where we run 7 DBs out onto the field, if you can't work your way into at least 2 of those 7 as 2nd round pick by the start of your 2nd season, there is a very serious problem."
Saints,34ng4c,Jesus_Oregon,8,Sun May 3 09:46:17 2015 UTC,"These are good problems to have.  We desperately need some new blood in our backfield. I like some of the guys, they've been here and have stayed out of trouble and all that...but they have played like crap.  Don't get too attached to anyone just yet...there's a huge culling in the future."
Saints,34ng4c,Cpt_Sum_Ting_Wong,2,Sun May 3 14:15:25 2015 UTC,Don't forget special teams
Saints,34ng4c,Stokest26,4,Sat May 2 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"Even considering special teams, there's at most 10 LB spots and 12 DB spots. At the very least, 10-12 players are going to be battling for a roster spot just on the back end of our defense."
Saints,34ng4c,Hotdog_Skin,2,Sat May 2 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think our Safeties will be Byrd, Vaccaro, Sunseri, and Warren.  Corners will be Lewis, Browner, Frederick, Dixon, Williams, and either Breaux/SJB/Wilson at the Slot  I don't think Kenny Phillips has anything left as far as his knees are concerned.    Zimmerman, Davis, Bush, Sanford, Ball, and whoever doesnt win between Wilson, SJB, and Breaux all get lost in the numbers game.  Davis, Swann, and maybe Zimmerman go to the PS.  For LBers I would like to see a starting 4 of Gallete, Ellerbe, Anthony, and Kihaka. I think Hawthorne and Humber make up both back up ILB spots. Depending on camp performances, Hull, Knox, and Powell get the remaining OLB spots."
Saints,34ng4c,Stokest26,5,Sat May 2 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see Sunseri overtaking Bush unless by numbers game you mean cap number. And even then, I don't see us cutting a proven player for 2 million in cap space unless we had to rework things due to an injury.  Bush>Sunseri"
Saints,34ng4c,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Sat May 2 20:47:20 2015 UTC,My argument for sunseri is that I believe he has a high ceiling that Bush does.
Saints,34ng4c,Stokest26,1 point,Sat May 2 21:49:41 2015 UTC,I do like what I've seen from him so far. And bush will most likely be gone after this season. But he is a proven player unlike Sunseri. Personally I see both of them still being on the team.
Saints,34ng4c,Phunkatron,1 point,Sat May 2 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"Can we afford to keep 3 strong safeties, especially with a Williams coming in who can play both corner and safety?"
Saints,34ng4c,AGQ-,1 point,Sat May 2 22:08:22 2015 UTC,Bush played free safety when Byrd went down:
Saints,34ng4c,Stokest26,2,Sat May 2 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"I'd venture to guess  DT: Bunkley/Jenkins/Davison  DE: Jordan/Hicks/Foster/Ulles  OLB: Galette/Kikaha/Spencer/Tull and Haralson or Powell  ILB: Anthony/Ellerbe/Hawthorne/ and Humber or Knox  CB: Lewis/Browner/Williams*/Fredrick/Dixon and last spot one of SJB, Swann, Breaux, or Wilson  S: Byrd/Vaccaro/Sunseri/Warren/Bush  *Williams will almost certainly see work at SS  That's 27 players, which would leave us with the right number on offense assuming we have 6 WRs, 2 TEs, 4 RBs, 1 FB, 3 QBs, 3 Ts, 3 Gs, 1 C. I could also see us having 2 QBs and keeping a 3rd HB type TE in Orson Charles."
Saints,34ng4c,AGQ-,1 point,Sun May 3 05:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused. We wouldn't start two pass rush specialists at OLB, would we? I have a feeling Galette, Edebali, and Kikaha rotate at rush linebacker. I wouldn't be surprised if we play in a base nickel."
Saints,34ng4c,bhsfb33,1 point,Sun May 3 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised at that either. It's so hard to predict anything since we havent see the guys practice yet."
Saints,34ng4c,serenity_suppository,1 point,Sat May 2 21:36:27 2015 UTC,We're paying Junior way too much to be a rotational pass rusher.
Saints,34ng4c,AGQ-,1 point,Sat May 2 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I certainly agree, but IIRC he did rotate with Edebali this year, right?    I'd like to see more than one of them on the field, but I think they all unfortunately fall under the mold ""pretty good pass rusher, little experience with much else"".  Add in the structure of the  extension we have Galette (making it hard to cut or trade him for a few years) and it looks to me like we have a timeshare at OLB, and may for a few years."

Saints,34nm8v,DrAquafresh793,2,Sun May 3 15:21:00 2015 UTC,He will need development. The highlight reel showed some of his better plays and reactions/adjustments but he's also had some truly miserable showings

Saints,34nm8v,Megawatts19,3,Sun May 3 17:36:31 2015 UTC,"I know people were kind of confused at the Peat pick, but I'm super excited about this kid. His hands are amazing. He has a really fast strike and he has so much mass in his legs. He's not a prototypical tackle build, but he could definitely work."
Saints,34nm8v,Twistify804,3,Sun May 3 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"As someone who followed Missouri closely this year, I'm excited about the Marcus Murphy pick. The dude is so fun to watch, and can make a play anytime he touches the ball."
Saints,34nily,Jesus_Oregon,14,Sat May 2 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"I am hugely content with this draft class. I'm so happy we didn't trade up early. I'm glad we used those picks and got guys at positions we were in need of. Peat is a bit of a head scratcher, but with Strief on the wrong side of 30 and Harris as our backup, I can definitely understand the move. Aside from he and Grayson, it was defense heavy. And for that, I'm very very happy. Not a lot of flashy picks, but solid picks to fill holes in our roster. Hopefully these young guys can come in and push for playing time. I'm excited!"
Saints,34nily,Megawatts19,7,Sat May 2 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"I agree for the most part.  I'm in the minority that I don't like the Grayson pick, not because I don't think he has the potential to be a good player but he's already 23 and I don't like the timing of it all.  Drew's got quite a bit left in the tank and I think that 3rd rounder could have been better spent considering we need to win now."
Saints,34nily,BootsBean,5,Sat May 2 20:41:57 2015 UTC,Drew's got quite a bit left in the tank   You never know. Brett Favre looked like he had a TON left in the tank with the Vikings then the very next year he wasn't the same player.
Saints,34nily,platypuspracticus,2,Sat May 2 23:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree about the Grayson pick, it's the only problem I have with this draft. I wanted D line or a W (maybe TE) there"
Saints,34nily,KarmaPoIice,1 point,Sat May 2 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I didn't like about the Grayson pick as well. If Payton thinks he's ""their guy"", fine, I've got to trust him on that. But when you look at the guys available at that point in the draft that could have stepped in right away and make large contributions to the team, it sucks that you passed on solid guys like that for a QB who possibly never starts a game (there are some exceptions obviously, but generally QBs taken after the top two rounds don't become starters). They could have picked an ILB in Dawson or an OLB in Harold or a DL in Davis who could come in and make large impacts on this defense right away, but they chose to invest in a QB. It could still pay off, and they still addressed other positions on D at other points in the draft, but you can never have too many guys who can be solid contributors on defense. Excited to see how Grayson pans out, but would have also been excited to see guys like Dawson, Harold or Davis make large contributions on D as well."
Saints,34nily,Hedgery,0,Mon May 4 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"I think there are a lot of fans that are going to resent the pick. They love Brees and want him to play until he's 42.  The bottom line is...the bottom line.  Drew's cap hit for this season will be over 26 million. Next year, it's over 27 million. He's 36 and has been in the League for 14 years. http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-orleans-saints/drew-brees/  We can't rebuild ( and make no mistake, we are in the middle of a rebuild) with Brees forcing us to pay the entire contract and refusing to budge on a restructuring. Some will say that he's earned that money and is worth every cent..others, like myself, will say that we cannot afford to pay that much for a QB who is...sadly...too old and it's time to move on."
Saints,34nily,Hotdog_Skin,10,Sat May 2 21:26:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree strongly on your reasoning.  Now, I don't hate the pick. I'm ok with it. But you've got the reasoning all wrong.  Brees hasn't ""refused"" to restructure. His specifically stated he's willing to do that.   And how can you say he's too old and it's time to move on? The dude is consistently putting up monster stats behind an atrocious o-line.   Now if we finally get him a good o-line this year and he still throws a lot of interceptions, or his completion rating tanks, then I could see what you're saying. Or if our defense is respectable and he still makes bad decisions, then ok.   But to say he is too old and it's time to move on right now... That's just grossly inaccurate IMO."
Saints,34nily,Hotdog_Skin,-2,Sat May 2 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"I would ask you to define what you thought ''grossly inaccurate'' meant?  He's 36, 37 in January...enormous cap hit the next few years... He is a great Qb, no one could deny that. Joe Montana was a great Qb too.  For all the talk of willingness to restructure, I cannot think of a time that would have served us better than this off season to do that. Look at what we had to do to our roster just to try to get our cap in a spot where we could sign our picks.  Drew Brees has the highest cap hit of any player in the NFL...and second place isn't even close. Hell, look at some of the other top shelf Qb's cap hit in comparison...It's almost comical when compared to Drew's. http://www.spotrac.com/rankings/nfl/2015/cap-hit/  He's a great Qb on the tail end of a great career...but he's killing us with his salary. In order for us to move ahead and get better as a team, we are going to have to make a serious change, very soon.  I fail to see what's ''grossly inaccurate'' about that."
Saints,34nily,Stokest26,3,Sat May 2 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"None of your stats are grossly inaccurate. What I stated was that your conclusion of him being ""too old and time to move on"" was inaccurate.  You seem to think Brees is refusing to restructure.  You're wrong.  He has stated, multiple times, that he is willing to. And why wouldn't he? Do you know what happens when players restructure? It typically involves extending a contract. Restructure does not mean paycut. Regardless of what all the Brady-Dick-suckers think.   The bottom line is, we haven't asked him to restructure. To me, this means Payton wants to part ways with Drew while he's still on top.   If we restructure with him, that likely means we will have him under contract additional years during his true decline. Extending him past his contract means we will be paying (possibly) top dollar for a QB that isn't worth it.  But that's not what's happening right now. Ever since Goodwin/Nicks left, our O-line has been pushing Drew to work outside his comfort zone. But then you might say, ""hey, we're paying you a billion dollars, you should be working outside your comfort zone."" Well he has been. He's been consistently putting up fantastic numbers even with the pressure he's been getting. What drew needs, is a respectable defense, a respectable o-line, and he'll bring us another Lombardi like he did in 2009. That's what you pay a QB for. Not to do it alone, but to do it with the supporting cast that any team manager should provide.   Look. We all know that Drew has a special place in our hearts because of what he has done for this franchise. And because of that special place, we're worried that we'll give him more leeway to underperform than we should because of his accolades. But that's just not the case here. Dude is a 100million dollar quarterback, and should be paid every dime he gets. It's not about what he deserves, it's about what we need out of the QB position to add another Lombardi to our trophy case. And if you ""move on from Brees,"" because you think he's ""too old,"" you're making a mistake based on conjecture, and not based on logic and statistics."
Saints,34nily,krazy9000,2,Sun May 3 06:48:40 2015 UTC,I think the Grayson pick is a very savvy move. It gives the team some leverage against Brees insofar as getting him to restructure next off-season.
Saints,34nily,krazy9000,3,Sat May 2 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to get drew to restructure next season. It's the last year of his deal and as of now we have a ton of cap space next year. All Restructuring does is push big cap hits to later years. Mickey has managed the cap well enough so that we wouldn't have to do that, and drew wouldn't be sitting on a 30mil. cap hit at the age of 40. Now we can let Drew play out his contact, and if he decides to keep going after 2016, we can decide whether to sign him (to a much more cap friendly deal) or let Garrett take over."
Saints,34nily,krazy9000,2,Sun May 3 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"Brees isn't forcing us to do anything. Restructuring would actually be in his favor as he'd get more money up front. Mickey had managed the cap perfectly around Drew's contract so that we never even had to think about Restructuring. Even with Drew's huge cap hit next season we will have a ton of cap space, and we never once had to push his hits back to later years when he's even older. Now after next season, if drew wants to keep playing, he can sign a more manageable contract to end his career with us."
Saints,34nily,superduperpooperman,-1,Sun May 3 01:41:52 2015 UTC,"I see...  So not only will Drew finish out his current contract, but he'll sign a new one and retire in ..what...5-6 years?  Dude...I hate to break it to you but this will likely be the last season Brees is a Saint. Let them have one more 7-9 season and we will be looking for a new Coach, DC, OC and GM along with it.  For all the praise Loomis gets, he is the real reason we were in cap hell this off season. He kept pushing the contracts back, back loading them to the point that when they all started to hit the big pay days, we couldn't afford it. We had to gut the team..but..our biggest cap hit, by a tremendously large margin, is going to have to be addressed very soon. He's not going to get a new deal. We're not in serious contention for a Super Bowl and there's really no sense in keeping him around much longer. He's going to be 38 before this season ends. He has far to many 8-8 type seasons to justify the ridiculous cap hit we're taking on him now.  You might want to get yourself prepared, because there's very little chance he's around after this season."
Saints,34nily,Stokest26,3,Sun May 3 04:23:19 2015 UTC,"How do you figure we had to ""gut"" the team? The Graham trade? We got amazing return on that trade. Next season, even with drew's contact we are in great cap shape. There's no reason drew won't play out the contract. We've still managed to stay extremely competitive in fa. I don't get why you seem to think we're in cap hell, because we aren't and we never really were."
Saints,34nily,brokenearth02,2,Sun May 3 04:42:12 2015 UTC,"he has far too many 8-8 type seasons   Its funny how you say ""he"" like Drew is the only player on our team."

I watched him for a bit and noticed how freaking low he gets in his stance...It makes him seem smaller than what he is.  I'm sure it helps him in his leverage..I get all that, but it just really stood out to me just how much lower he seemed than the other linemen.  Maybe it was just me... I don't know."

Prior to coming in, the team wasn't known for having a strong D-Line, but he and a few other guys came in and dominated the league. Sad to see him go, but happy he's getting a chance in the NFL."

Saints,34ndtk,Matt_McT,3,Sat May 2 19:24:37 2015 UTC,I think the idea is he is quality depth at the nickel position. I'm more than OK with it.
Saints,34ndtk,FinleytheHuman,3,Sat May 2 19:26:02 2015 UTC,"As an UGA fan I LOVED Swann. Not afraid to get down an dirty. Def a man corner, gets caught watching sometimes in zone coverage. But solid tackling and very very very good at blitzing"
Saints,34ndtk,sfzen,2,Sat May 2 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, he was sort of a nickel CB and safety hybrid at Georgia, so I would guess he would be depth at the nickel spot for us. I can't see him beating out Wilson or anyone else for the starting nickel spot."
Saints,34ndtk,evtine,2,Sat May 2 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"I really don't like the trade. We lose an asset for next year when we could have stayed pat and grabbed Swann or even gotten Tre Mcbride, which I'm still baffled as to why he didn't go earlier."

Saints,34mqan,CSU_Mike,6,Sat May 2 17:57:47 2015 UTC,"Truly, he played a big part in the turnaround.   Making the change to an Alabama-styled offense under McElwain wouldn't have been possible without a solid quarterback like Grayson.   More than anything, he's smart - he doesn't make mental mistakes on the field. Another item that I think you'll appreciate is his ability to step into the pocket under pressure and deliver. It sent shivers down my spine.   He's not a college QB, he finishes his reads and makes a play. He'll very rarely (if ever) scramble when it's not necessary. Again, congrats, he could be one of the greats - especially getting some time to learn under Brees."
Saints,34mqan,brokenearth02,3,Sat May 2 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"SP says he has a real quick release, but everyone watching film says its long and slow.... If he blowing smoke or does he know better than us amateurs?"
Saints,34mqan,jmmeij,6,Sat May 2 16:38:55 2015 UTC,A former Saints LB is a coach on that college team (I think) and he worked with him extensively and so yes Payton knows more. He played an NFL ready scheme.
Saints,34mqan,platypuspracticus,3,Sat May 2 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"I have to assume he knows better. Also, he could have been working on his release and it may have gotten faster than the tape that we look at."

Saints,34n9m0,jackmuhswag,1 point,Sat May 2 18:42:03 2015 UTC,I do find it interesting that everyone quoted on his NFL Draft Profile says that there is absolutely no way that he can play in a 3-4 front. I'm guessing Rob Ryan thinks otherwise.   Seems like a solid value pick at a position of need.
Saints,34n9m0,Matt_McT,3,Sat May 2 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"We play a lot of 4-2-5 and so, I'm going to assume he's meant to fit into that front but honestly, I don't think anyone knows much about him to be honest..."

Saints,34ntqf,jacksandwich,3,Sat May 2 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"Before we got Saunders, he had a bad case of the drops (hence us being his 3rd team his rookie season). His time with us was too short to lock him in as ""the"" return guy."
Saints,34ntqf,asmodeus01,1 point,Sat May 2 23:16:49 2015 UTC,did we cut him? but yeah I didn't think he had much value as an actual receiver but I liked the return game
Saints,34ntqf,jacksandwich,2,Sat May 2 23:24:29 2015 UTC,This is what I was thinking. I was watching a small highlight reel and it seemed like he was pretty good at it.
Saints,34ntqf,GenrlWashington,4,Sat May 2 22:27:11 2015 UTC,Prepare to see practice squad receivers who can put up 1000 yard seasons just because we have Brees.   It's a little worrying but they must believe in Seantavius and Coleman.
Saints,34ntqf,ashsky,2,Sat May 2 21:50:52 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Toon. I've never understood why the coaches love Toon, but he's going to have a much increased role this year."
Saints,34ntqf,Megawatts19,1 point,Sun May 3 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"Sean Payton said in his post draft press conference he likes, and looks for more production out of Seantavious, Toon, and Coleman so he didn't feel any pressure to go with a receiver"
Saints,34ntqf,BurningToast,1 point,Sun May 3 14:46:10 2015 UTC,"Gotta figure they're building up the line so Brees has enough time to not have to worry about who he's throwing to.  Plus it looks to me like we're tryna emulate our super bowl winning team, didn't have a bunch of all star recievers then, Colston, Moore, Shockey etc. But Brees had the best O-Line in the league, and with that much time he can make anyone look good"
Saints,34ntqf,djmcintyre,6,Sun May 3 17:32:59 2015 UTC,i would have took one but you could tell the coaches confidence in Toon was building towards the end of the season.

Saints,34ntqf,serenity_suppository,5,Sun May 3 02:14:37 2015 UTC,Apparently Murphy has some value as a slot receiver
Saints,34ntqf,Vicarious28,4,Sat May 2 21:51:03 2015 UTC,"They'll more than likely sign a few as UDFAs. Let's face it, ""Would you like to catch balls from a HoF QB?"" is a hell of a sales pitch."
Saints,34ntqf,bacchusthedrunk,2,Sat May 2 21:55:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think we needed to draft one. We have plenty of guys who can get the job done, and Brees could do a good job with even UDFAs and possible trades."
Saints,34ntqf,GenrlWashington,2,Sat May 2 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with not signing one unless it was incredible value for the pick. I would have loved to get Jaelen Strong in the 3rd round if he fell to us, for example. Not disappointed he didn't."

Saints,34ntqf,AGQ-,1 point,Sun May 3 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"I wish they would've used their 7th rounder on Dezmin Lewis or Tre McBride, two WRs I thought would've gone in the 4th or 5th at the latest, but this shows they're confident in the young WRs they have (and also probably further shows their commitment to becoming a power run team as opposed to a pass happy team). They must be confident that Toon, Saunders, Jones, Coleman and Morgan will be able to step up this year and be solid weapons for Brees. I like the potential of Saunders and Coleman, and think if they can solve their dropping issues that they could be solid WRs. Obviously Coleman has the size factor, but if he can come into camp/the preseason and show that he can catch the ball better and run better routes, he could see a decent amount of playing time this year. Saunders already showed last year that he can return the ball, and he seems like a pretty dynamic, slippery player with the ball in his hands, so if he can have better hands and not drop as many balls, I could see him as a guy who could be a potential deep threat or at the very least could be used on some WR screen plays that could utilize his ability in space well. Hopefully their confidence in this group of young WRs pays off."
Saints,34n9fw,dubya_a,7,Sat May 2 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"Each player's injury is different. But yeah I'm glad they are taking educated risks here.  I really like the Kikaha pick, you dont just luck your way into 19 sacks in a season."

If Brees can teach him to not stairdown his intended receiver a little better and if they can get a little more zip on his ball without ruining accuracy, this is the guy to have. The guy knows how to run a pro style offense, great under pressure, and will take a hit if it is going to make the play."
Saints,34l1xv,tebam,22,Sat May 2 15:16:52 2015 UTC,Broncos fan here in peace...  As a current CSU student all I can say is you guys picked up a great QB.

Saints,34l1xv,pomeranc,2,Sat May 2 12:32:25 2015 UTC,As a Saints fan I truly appreciate your vote of confidence. I'm surprised actually you guys didn't shop harder for a QB in the draft. Who's next in line after Manning?
Saints,34l1xv,tebam,2,Sat May 2 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"I kind of am too. I know Kubiak and Elway really liked Grayson, but I figured someone else would pick him up before we got a chance.   Right now it's Brock Osweiler. He seems to have a great skill set but there just isn't much tape on him other than pre season at the moment. I hope he works out for us because it's really going to suck once Manning retires haha"
Saints,34l1xv,pomeranc,2,Sat May 2 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Yah, I'm not too worried about Brees but you'd have to wonder how much gas he'll have left after 2017. Manning on the other hand has to be treated like it's his last season for each season going forward."
Saints,34l1xv,tebam,1 point,Sat May 2 15:08:11 2015 UTC,Yeah granted I don't watch every Saints game but it seemed like Brees was the least of your problems last season.    Manning said this isn't his fair well your but he needs to play like its the last time he will see the field again and hopefully that attitude extends to the rest of our team.
Saints,34l1xv,aatencio91,1 point,Sat May 2 15:38:10 2015 UTC,"Grayson is in a great spot right now to take his time and sharpen his skills while Brees goes ham for another couple of years.   Grayson can sit and work on not staring down his primary receivers, getting his release time up to speed, and getting adjusted to the speed of the game.   As a Colorado sports fan, I wanted to see Grayson go somewhere where he'd be in the best position to learn before being thrown on the field, and I think the Saints are the perfect situation for him. He's got time to practice and work on stuff, but it seems there's a real chance he's in his forever home and could be Brees' heir."
Saints,34l1xv,neovenator250,21,Sat May 2 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like this pick.  A little earlier than I wanted him, but not early enough that I have a problem with it.  By far my favorite QB in this class for the Saints.  I straight dislike Petty, FWIW.  Grayson comes from a pro-style system, is intelligent, can read defenses, and literally WANTS to sit behind Brees and learn and get better.  I think Sean Payton can do a lot with him.  I saw him play two games in person at CSU last year.  Very promising, IMO"

Saints,34l1xv,DenverLn,7,Sat May 2 03:10:17 2015 UTC,"I watched him quite a bit at CSU. He ran a Pro style offense, and I think has the smarts to play QB in the NFL, but I'm not sure physically he has what it takes (although as Saints fans you guys know what they said about Drew Brees...). I do think his numbers in college were helped by the offense McElwain ran (he also had a BEAST WR in Rashard Higgins).  That being said, if anyone can make him a good QB it's Sean Payton."

Saints,34l1xv,depressedcarguy,1 point,Sat May 2 16:01:23 2015 UTC,His velocity could be better on the out routes. He needs to throw a more horizontal ball. Definitely something that can be remedied with professional coaching.

His arm is good enough for the NFL, though not the strongest. However, he's really accurate and fits the ball into tight places because his receivers were not the most talented and didn't always create the most separation. Really good football IQ and comes out of a pro style offense so the transition isn't as bad.  When The Day of Which We Will Not Speak comes, which sadly is sooner rather than later, I think we will be in good hands with Grayson or Griffin behind a solid OL."

Saints,34l1xv,bobbyblack,1 point,Sat May 2 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"Not a fan of this pick at all. So many talented defensive players left on the board and they take a developmental QB who it's very likely may never start a game in the NFL. Would have been fine drafting a developmental QB in the 5th round or later, but this early it's just a waste seeing how most QBs drafted after the top two rounds never even end up seeing the field or being solid starters in the NFL, so why waste a 3rd rounder on a guy who likely won't ever be good enough to be a starter when there were so many defensive players left who could be starters and develop well (Dawson, Davis, Jarrett, Phillips, Harold, Bennett, Hunter, and Mauldin just to name a few).  This team went 7-9 last year, and that was largely in part due to a terrible defense. Adding difference makers to that defense is what the Saints needed to do in this draft. And with so many potential difference makers left on the board, the Saints take a guy who will at best be a decent backup QB in the NFL. Just a waste of a pick when the Saints needed to have a huge draft this year."

Obviously there are other needs to fill, but drafting even ""unneeded"" QBs isn't necessarily a bad strategy.  EDIT: And add 2015 to the list."
Saints,34ky98,Bouzal,2,Sat May 2 03:42:58 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people are already saying this kid won't start for 3-4 years.  With Brees' cap hit next season and his (seemingly) unwillingness to take less pay, Grayson may very well be our starter next season. If anything, this move could make Drew reconsider his tough stance on a restructure. If not, we have a very good candidate for taking his spot.  Watch some film on this kid and you'll see he makes all the throws required for a Sean Payton offense. Rb screens, Wr bubble screens( on both sides of the field) and the ability to get rid of the ball quickly are what he does best. He has the size and frame to allow him to take some hits and he is very good at moving in the pocket, while keeping his eyes down field. This kid is the perfect fir for our offense and I am stoked that we got him."

Saints,34l4fj,Phunkatron,2,Sat May 2 06:29:52 2015 UTC,I'm stating that this looks pretty good on paper so far . Yea 06 draft was a good draft
Saints,34l4fj,sarcastic_charisma,1 point,Sat May 2 06:43:13 2015 UTC,The 06 draft looked average-to-bad on paper and was likely the best draft we've ever had. Last year looked like a great draft and has been a crapshoot so far.
Saints,34l4fj,Phunkatron,1 point,Sat May 2 07:54:10 2015 UTC,What about this year's draft? Looks like we have 2 instant starters a qb protege an a steal at cornerback. Oh right a sack machine from washington. Looking good so far
Saints,34l4fj,sarcastic_charisma,-3,Sat May 2 14:57:06 2015 UTC,"Who are the 2 instant starters? ""QB protege"" is laughable/pathetic, dude might turn out good but he isn't Aaron Rodgers or some shit.  I have trouble respecting the opinion of anyone judging a draft class ""definitely the best draft of the loomis/sean Payton era"" before they even play a snap... or the draft is even completed. 2006 our best players hadn't even been selected at the point when you made that statement."
Saints,34l4fj,Phunkatron,2,Sat May 2 18:56:31 2015 UTC,The offensive tackle and MLB have the potential to start off bat . If they put in the work and are up to speed they could be instant starters.  Ok I get it 06 draft class was good. Don't lose your shit
Saints,34l4fj,sarcastic_charisma,2,Sat May 2 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"The players and organization have a mutual admiration for each other, so there's that."
Saints,34l4fj,wolfbrother180,3,Sat May 2 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'd have taken sammie coates instead of grayson, brees has a good 3 years in him at least, but hey, that's the same amount rodgers was sitting behind favre    otherwise, I see 4 starters out of 5 picks, which sounds pretty awesome"
Saints,34l4fj,fionnarix,1 point,Sat May 2 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"No. No they are not. Peat, Anthony and Williams are solid picks, but they aren't home run picks by any means. Solid picks still though. But Kikaha and Grayson are bad picks in my opinion. Even Williams there were other better players left on the board when they took him, but he's still a good pick since he easily could have gone higher and he was the best CB left on the board.  But Kikaha and Grayson are bad picks in my opinion. Both produced well in college, but college production means very little when they're competing against far lesser talented players than in the NFL. Kikaha isn't the greatest pass rusher, nor is he that strong against the run, and his 19 sacks in college are very misleading, more of a product of being on a defense that featured many other talented players (Shelton, Thompson, Peters, etc.) than due to his own pass rushing skill. Think he'll be a bust, and any number of other defensive players left on the board at that point (Kendricks, Perryman, Darby, Phillips, Harold, Dawson, Jarrett, Davis, even Gregory) or even offensive guys who should be studs (Maxx Williams, Jaelen Strong) would have been much better options.  Same goes for Grayson. Why waste a 3rd round pick on a developmental QB who probably best case will be a backup QB for his career when there are potential defensive starters left on the board (Davis, Harold, Dawson, Jarrett, Bennett, Alexander, Wilson, etc.)? So many talented players left that could make an impact on this team right away and down the road, why waste that on a hope that Grayson might turn into something he probably isn't? If this was the fifth round, sure take the chance, but in the third round with so much talent left on the board it's really just a missed opportunity.  So no, I don't think the Saints are quietly having one of the best drafts. At best it's a decent draft where they scored a few solid players and missed out on others. I had fifth round grades on both Kikaha and Grayson, and they'd have likely gone before the fifth, but neither of them were worth picking where they were picked.  As always, there is a good chance that I could be wrong. And I hope I am and I'll admit I'm wrong if Kikaha ends up being productive in the NFL or if by some miracle Grayson ends up being a starter at some point. But I think both of those scenarios are doubtful. And I think the Saints missed a huge opportunity to help turn this defense around by missing on these two picks.  TL;DR: Don't think the Saints are quietly having the best draft, or even a good draft for that matter. Think they missed a great opportunity to help turn this defense around with so many picks in the first three rounds."
Saints,34l4fj,Hedgery,8,Sat May 2 16:15:39 2015 UTC,This is the type of person who thinks they know more about football than the GM of a football team

Saints,34l4fj,Saints2Death,2,Sat May 2 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The coaches/GMs know far more about what they're doing than a guy like me ever could. But that doesn't mean I can't question their moves. Loomis and Payton have done a great job in their time with the Saints, but they're not beyond questioning, especially when you look at their last few drafts. Needed a home run with this draft, and I don't even think it's a double."
Saints,34l4fj,Hedgery,1 point,Sat May 2 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think I know more than the GM at all, just saying what I would have done, and think that they could have done better. Why just assume that everything a coach and GM does is perfect and that they're infallible? It's not a terrible draft, just think they could have done better. And coming off of a down year where they needed to fix up the defense, they needed to knock this draft out of the park. They made some solid picks, but a few whiffs for sure. Same could be said about every team, but with the Saints having 5 picks in the top 78 picks, they needed to hit on those picks to get this team back where they need to be."
Saints,34l4fj,Hedgery,1 point,Sat May 2 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to read all of that, but I agree with you Kikawhatever will only be a situational pass rusher, and he might have aldon smith type success with it, idts, but he might. Payton wants to keep saying that you don't go after need but who you have highest rated. But that is just BS, they are going after what they think our needs are (completely disregardingeneral what a lot of thinks our needs are, or where we believe we should draft them.) I think it was a reach for Peat because  they thought it was going to be a run at Tackle, (I have no clue why you address a tackle when I think all of Saints Nation believes our only weakness is LG). Anthony is good pick, I personally wanted Kendricks, but still good pick. Kika, situational is a waste of second rounder. Williams is good value pick, don't care for it, but not bad. Grayson meh, whatever. He said it was a fluke that they worked him out, and thathe they had a second round grade. He's probably our future, like it or not. Overall I can look at teams that did better than us, like the Vikings and Bengals (one who's picks were before, ones picks were after us in picking order.) Season me salty."
Saints,34l4fj,aimerj,1 point,Sat May 2 19:37:05 2015 UTC,"Payton also said something in his press conference talking about Grayson along the lines of ""Forget about grades, he was our guy."". Just shows that even though they say they pick their highest graded guy, that's not always the case. Sometimes, they just like a guy and have a good feeling about a guy so they take him. You mean to tell me that Kikaha was their top rated guy as a situational pass rusher when their were better pass rushers available, plus guys who had potential to be starting LBs (Kendricks, Dawson, Perryman), starting DL (Jarrett, Bennett, Davis, etc.), or some solid offensive guys (Strong, Williams)? I'll happily admit I'm wrong if Kikaha ends up being solid, but I just don't see it."

Saints,34k134,typical0,2,Sat May 2 01:16:47 2015 UTC,"Haha!! I'm just trying to get excited. Not that I have anything against this pick, but like someone said on here before... It's like getting socks for Christmas, you can use it and it's practical, but it's not exciting.  Edit: credit to /u/donvito7335 for the Christmas analogy."
Saints,34k134,Lokipokie504,2,Sat May 2 02:25:00 2015 UTC,Just a joke. Seemed like they threw it right to him a few times in that highlight reel. I'm actually a lot more excited about this pick today than I was yesterday.
Saints,34k134,baconlovr,1 point,Sat May 2 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"The thing about the draft though is that people get really worked up whenever the teams make their picks.

That being said... I hope our picks aren't busts!!!"

Saints,34lj22,VegasSaint9,1 point,Sat May 2 09:20:46 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the Saints take La'el Collins and Kwon Alexander with their first two picks today. Yeah, I know, I'm an LSU fan and that sounds like fanboy type dreaming. But we have a need a guard and Collins is a huge step up for Lelito. He has always had a rep as a very high character guy too, and I have to think this investigation is going to just run it's course and point another direction.   Alexander might look like too much because he's a 3rd LB, but remember we play a variant on a 3-4, and in that system each LB has a different job. Weakside is a pure pass rusher, that's Jr. Gallette. SS is a hybrid pass rusher/TE cover guy, that's where Kikaha slots in. The two inside guys traditionally are a pure inside run stuffer, our first round pick covers that. The other is the David Hawthorne spot, still not addressed, and that calls for a playmaker who can play pass coverage and move sideline to sideline. With Kwon Alexanders speed and athleticism he'd be a possible David Hawthorne replacement long term and short term a great special teams pickup."
Saints,34lj22,backgrinder,1 point,Sat May 2 13:51:41 2015 UTC,If La'el is on the board I wouldn't hate it. He can't reenter the draft.   Deandre smelter has made some waves as well but maybe doesnt fall out of the 4th.
Saints,34k4o7,baconlovr,6,Fri May 1 21:08:46 2015 UTC,"Collins is a first round talent. It wouldn't make me sad if we drafted him with any of the three picks tonight. We just better have done our homework before drafting him. But i will say this, if anyone could get the inside scoop on the case from the BRPD, it would be the Saints."
Saints,34k4o7,Saints2Death,5,Fri May 1 22:27:09 2015 UTC,Idk why anyone thinks he's a problem. He's a witness not a suspect... If he wasn't a witness he would have gone top 10.

Saints,34iw91,Plan2Exist18,3,Fri May 1 20:12:45 2015 UTC,"Gregory seems like a liability to me. Look at the two guys the Saints grabbed at 13 and 31, both of them said playing in NOLA is ""a dream come true"" - compared to Gregory's comments about the town during his visit.  Not expecting to see Eli Harold on the board at 44, Bears and Browns both have defensive issues to address this round.  Between Devin Smith, DGB, and Jaelen Strong - its a toss up for how good they will be. I can only speak from experience on Strong about how good he is and how mentally ready he is to play at this level. Not to mention he has the surest hands out of all three of those WRs"
Saints,34iw91,CallMeGerbraldo,2,Fri May 1 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"I think Devin Smith is a little better version of K Stills, DGB has the highest ceiling left, but I do agree Jaelen Strong would definitely be the most pro ready at this point."

Saints,34iw91,neovenator250,1 point,Fri May 1 22:24:41 2015 UTC,completely agree.  Love his size and ability to go up and get the ball.
Saints,34iw91,lambquentin,7,Fri May 1 23:20:52 2015 UTC,"If you re-watch the end where the Saints get the final interception to end the game, the ball was intercepted with :44 seconds remaining."

Saints,34iw91,lambquentin,7,Fri May 1 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it wasn't actually the interception that was at :44.  Though on 4th and goal the Colts snapped the ball at like the :50 mark and threw an incomplete pass that stopped the clock at :44 and gave us the ball and the rest is history.  Tracy Porter's pick was like with 3 minutes and some change left."
Saints,34iw91,hubristichumor,3,Fri May 1 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"Excuse me, I was thinking interception for some reason. It was an incomplete pass instead but regardless the coolness about it is still there."
Saints,34iw91,sfzen,5,Fri May 1 19:48:46 2015 UTC,Agreed.... by all means the game was over as soon as the clock stopped at :44.  The significance is definitely still there.  Pick #44 HOF confirmed!

He was 11th overall in ESPN rankings, 15th at CBS Sports, and ranked as the #2 LT by Walter Football and lots of other outlets.    Sure the pick didn't address a serious need, but I don't think it's fair to call it a reach.

Saints,34k2mo,quantumhed,5,Fri May 1 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with this, is that Streif is a god damn giant. I don't see how Drew would be able to see over him to deliver the ball over the middle of the field."
Saints,34k2mo,Lokipokie504,3,Fri May 1 21:39:41 2015 UTC,Armstead is the midget of the group at 6'5. Poor guy.
Saints,34k2mo,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 1 22:24:49 2015 UTC,New kid is 6'7. Brees will have to learn
Saints,34k2mo,typical0,1 point,Fri May 1 22:15:06 2015 UTC,I honestly believe Streif is bigger than 6'7. He looked taller than Jimmy
Saints,34k2mo,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 1 22:29:28 2015 UTC,"Some reasons to believe it will be Armstead. LT to LG is an easy transition whereas RT to LG isn't. Some reason to believe armstead will be a better RT than LT but Peat is definitely the LT week 1.   As for the second question, no chance we trade strief. Just resigned him and it was a good deal. I say he stays at the least a swing lineman - a valuable backup at worst. He's also a team captain iirc so I think he'll be valuable in that capacity."
Saints,34k2mo,typical0,1 point,Fri May 1 21:54:06 2015 UTC,I think Armstead's speed and athleticism makes him way better suited to be a tackle than a guard. Strief has some experience playing guard; he was our utility 5th OL in our Super Bowl season and moved all over the line.
Saints,34k2mo,sfzen,2,Sat May 2 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"It's time for Streif to retire, he's too slow & old!"
Saints,34k2mo,roscoe21,1 point,Sat May 2 03:15:03 2015 UTC,I agree. It looks like he gets tired fast and then gives up too easy.
Saints,34k2mo,togetherments,1 point,Sat May 2 12:42:02 2015 UTC,"We'll see after this weekend, but me personally I think Armstead would be the best guard of the three due to his build and athleticism.   I'm still trying to find a link where people say Payton said none of the three are moving to guard. I can't find any links anywhere."
Saints,34k2mo,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 21:00:50 2015 UTC,"You may be referring to Peat. He said Peat was a LT, not a guard."
Saints,34k2mo,typical0,2,Fri May 1 22:17:51 2015 UTC,"No I was referencing the press conference. My take on it is that initially there will be an open battle for both tackle positions and that none of the three tackles will go into camp as a guard, but that doesn't mean the odd man out won't move inside by the end of camp. Payton made no definitives in his statement, but people are taking it that way."
Saints,34k2mo,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 22:23:20 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that all of them will play tackle, and even on the field at the same time, with Payton expanding use of the 6th lineman. But unless Peat earns a job, I doubt they'll take away a starting spot from Armstead or Strief."
Saints,34k2mo,dubya_a,1 point,Fri May 1 22:39:04 2015 UTC,I think he'll let Peat sit for a while and ease him into the position like he did with Armstead. We're not in a situation where we have to force anything.
Saints,34k2mo,sfzen,0,Sat May 2 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"What I believe to be the most probable alignment  Peat at LT  Armstead at LG  Unger at Center with Golic backing him up.  Evans at Rg with Lelito as backup  and Strief will continue as right tackle. But personally I think Armstead would be better suited here, due to his athleticism being able to quickly block on run plays."
Saints,34k79k,smilefortony,3,Fri May 1 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"So my take on what he said was that Peat, Armstead, and Strief will be going into camp battling for the two tackle spots and it's not out of the realm of possibility that the odd man out could move to guard.   I think what Payton was saying was that there was no initial plan to move any one of the three tackles to guard when Peat was drafted, but that doesn't mean it won't happen if that's the best lineup on Week 1."
Saints,34k79k,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 22:20:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm. That's not really how I read that.  Sure, we definitely can't rule it out because he didn't specifically say ""nobody is moving to gaurd,"" but I didn't see anything in there that even hints to one of the three playing gaurd. And Payton even stated outright at the end that Peat is a tackle.   I think it was a BPA move.  I'm also wondering if Strief is mulling retirement after this season and gave Payton a heads up. Someone else mentioned this, and I could see it considering the rapport Strief has with the organization.  All of this is speculation of course. But I don't see either of our 3 tackles playing gaurd come week 1."
Saints,34k79k,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Sat May 2 01:20:01 2015 UTC,"Sean Payton also said that Butler's camp injury two years ago was nothing.  So, I'm not going to let his press remarks hold weight until the start of the season."

Saints,34j10j,NFLVideoConverterBot,6,Fri May 1 15:54:54 2015 UTC,OL and LB in the first round. Ireland doing his thing lol  Hope it works out better for you guys...
Saints,34j10j,putsomeKiefonit,5,Fri May 1 15:55:58 2015 UTC,"Eh to be fair LB was one of our biggest needs.  Tackle is debatable, there were a few people who disagreed with getting O line in yhe first round but ultimately I think it's a good selection.  We need to protect Drew and in the process make Ingram's job easier.  I'm not familiar with Ireland or other teams woes with him, however.    I'm very happy we didn't draft a WR, it's not a need for us. Yes we need guys but not from the first. I'd much rather use our 3rd round picks on a WR."
Saints,34j10j,Mudkipz137,5,Fri May 1 18:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure man. The two guys you drafted seem totally reasonable as far as your needs go.  It was just a running joke with Ireland that he always went ""cornfed"" etc.. Just hasslin'!"

Saints,34jmsd,kweeche,19,Fri May 1 19:19:48 2015 UTC,"I like to think of The draft as something of ""Spring Christmas""   This christmas we got the equivalent of socks, and slacks. Yeah socks and slacks are not the most exciting thing and its going to look lame in comparison to what you buddies might get but you can bet you are going to use the shit out of those socks and slacks!"
Saints,34jmsd,donvito7335,4,Fri May 1 19:26:33 2015 UTC,Best explanation for it.
Saints,34jmsd,Mudkipz137,7,Fri May 1 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"the more I read about the picks and Payton's interviews the more excited I am about the picks, Peat seems like a kid with great character and Anthony was the defensive leader in college. I'm perfectly fine with us going after guys with good attitudes throughout the draft."
Saints,34jmsd,LegionPeep,15,Fri May 1 19:18:01 2015 UTC,No.
Saints,34jmsd,makeplayz,7,Fri May 1 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"Not at all.   Peat was a BPA pick and will instantly give us a ton of flexibility on the line. Peat is who many believe is the best LT prospect in the draft, and we went from have no depth at tackle to having three guys who could be Day 1 starters. Either Strief or Armstead will be pushed inside next season, which puts Lelito back as a quality depth player for both guard and center, and Kelemete as another inside depth player. I went from being worried that one injury on the line could end any hope in 2015 to being comfortable with the personnel.  It doesn't matter who you think was the best ILB, or who Kiper, McShay, Mayock or any other analyst thought was the No. 1 ILB. We drafted who we thought was the best ILB because we had the choice between every ILB. You can't fault a team for draft who they think was the best player at a position of need. Yeah, you may think Kendrick was better, but guys who are making millions of dollars and have invested their entire professional life in football thought Anthony is better. We got who those guys thought were the best at his position, and for that you should be happy.   Edit: and how do you know Kendrick would have been available in the 2nd round? And obviously our coaching staff liked Anthony over Kendricks because if the opposite was true, we would have drafted Kendricks."
Saints,34jmsd,Saints2Death,3,Fri May 1 19:05:50 2015 UTC,"Payton said all of them are tackles, and he doesn't see any of them switching to guard. This is why I hate this pick. If we are drafting for long-term success, go ahead and trade Brees and blow it all up. Don't waste your last few drafts with Brees leading the team taking players at positions of strength. Strief isn't done, anyone that says so either didn't pay attention for the past 2 years or they can read the future."

Saints,34jmsd,smilefortony,2,Fri May 1 21:23:10 2015 UTC,"I heard Payton say initially no one was moving to guard, but to me that just means that those three will be competing for two tackle positions in camp and one of them could move inside at some point."
Saints,34jmsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 21:33:50 2015 UTC,Yeah. Only time will tell.
Saints,34jmsd,smilefortony,3,Fri May 1 21:37:51 2015 UTC,i think Armstead moves to RT and Strief is backup duty
Saints,34jmsd,serenity_suppository,2,Fri May 1 19:18:49 2015 UTC,I don't think they would give drew's blind side to the rookie. he might come in on plays where we call for more linemen while they work on his skills
Saints,34jmsd,jaredb45,2,Fri May 1 19:49:25 2015 UTC,"All of that will be worked out in the preseason. You're right, Payton won't put Peat at LT if he isn't ready, but it's not unheard of for a rookie tackle to come into the league playing at a high level."
Saints,34jmsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 20:52:56 2015 UTC,Why uh.. Why are we assuming Peat wouldn't be competing for the starting RT job?
Saints,34jmsd,islelyre,5,Fri May 1 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"This is all my opinion, but I think Armstead was drafted as and is better suited for RT, not LT. He was forced into the LT role because Brown shit the bed."
Saints,34jmsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 21:04:54 2015 UTC,TA's natural position is RT
Saints,34jmsd,makeplayz,3,Sun May 3 12:11:35 2015 UTC,At least Bryce Harris doesn't have to touch the field
Saints,34jmsd,SoUnderrated,2,Fri May 1 20:42:21 2015 UTC,This can't be said enough!
Saints,34jmsd,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 1 23:54:46 2015 UTC,Seriously -- I would rather have an injured Strief than a healthy Harris backing up Armstead & Peat.
Saints,34jmsd,asmodeus01,4,Sat May 2 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"After my drunken hatred of it last night, I think I feel more underwhelmed than ""disappointed"" so to speak.  Kind of expected an impact player to make us contenders at #13 but we got depth instead which is definitely the best pick for the future but obviously, seeing as Payton said he's not even starting, it's not going to change much right now.  Anthony is fine. He has more character than the other ILB and I feel that's what we wanted. We needed a leader in our defense more than someone who may slightly have better coverage or intangibles.  For the future, the picks were fantastic. Two extremely high ceiling players but it's a little ""underwhelming"", especially Peat (in my opinion) because I don't see anything game changing instantly. We shall see how the other rounds go."
Saints,34jmsd,ashsky,1 point,Fri May 1 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"If Peat is ready to start, Streif will be playing inside."
Saints,34jmsd,quantumhed,2,Fri May 1 20:40:45 2015 UTC,"Not at all. O line was an issue (though I've seen people's concerns with who will play what) and we got a solid guy to help protect Drew, and we addressed our hole at ILB.    yes it's not flashy but you know what? A flashy receiver is no good if our QB is getting sacked every play, and our hopefully now improved secondary doesn't mean much if we can't generate any pass rush.  I'm crazy, but I hope tonight with our picks we pick LB, DE, and maybe either a WR or another O line guy (saw some stuff about collins). Those aren't in order just the positions I'd like to see addressed.  I'm sure many will disagree with me putting O line in when we just drafted #13 a o line and have already patched our O line with Unger and moving Lelito but this is why I'm not a coach."
Saints,34jmsd,Mudkipz137,2,Fri May 1 20:26:52 2015 UTC,Based on Payton and Loomis' statements Peat will play day one. They said they wanted guys that will make an immediate impact. Anthony I already know will make an impact on our slow defense.
Saints,34jmsd,VegasSaint9,2,Fri May 1 20:40:54 2015 UTC,"Nope, not at all. Everyone always wants big time skill position players and it's hard to shake that sugar high. It's hard for me too. But honestly, this tackle is amazing and so is this linebacker. Just look the Cowboys or the 49ers for help in this matter."
Saints,34jmsd,quantumhed,2,Fri May 1 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, I still think one of our tackles will move to guard, which means this pick was for a starter and not just depth. And I occasionally saw Anthony mocked at the end of the 1st round. Obviously many people say we should have drafted Kendricks, but it's close enough that I trust PayLoo."
Saints,34jmsd,AgaliareptX,1 point,Fri May 1 18:48:52 2015 UTC,Would have personally liked to get Dupree or even Parker at 13 but I think the team has more faith in Anthony Spencer than people think. Love the Anthony pick. He is a different kind of player than Kendricks and is a higher ceiling pick IMO
Saints,34jmsd,dean815,1 point,Fri May 1 22:23:51 2015 UTC,I went to high school with this kid. He was a monster at 16. That is all.
Saints,34jofv,TheAwes0meFish,2,Fri May 1 18:54:33 2015 UTC,What's that smell? It's The Stinch.  Edit: as in Jon Stinchcomb to be clear.

Saints,34i9ge,SoUnderrated,6,Fri May 1 11:37:54 2015 UTC,My friend with an insider (the one who called the Peat pick) said there's no chance we get Gregory or DGB. I'm hoping for Harold.
Saints,34i9ge,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 13:02:05 2015 UTC,Any explanation for the Peat pick? Just guy they liked best?
Saints,34i9ge,pottersquash,3,Fri May 1 13:11:35 2015 UTC,"Apparently they think he can be a pro bowler for years. He said they were working out a trade to move up and get peters too, but KC snagged him first."
Saints,34i9ge,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 13:46:07 2015 UTC,it's probably for the best. we needed a solid ilb
Saints,34i9ge,serenity_suppository,4,Fri May 1 17:44:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, I like kendricks better, but I'm behind the Anthony pick. He said that Joe Vitt was freaking out about who to grab at 31, kendricks or Anthony, but went with Anthony because of size and athleticism."
Saints,34i9ge,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 17:51:05 2015 UTC,Is there something I don't know about Gregory? Why is it so definite we're not picking him?
Saints,34i9ge,saoXcore,1 point,Fri May 1 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"Tbh, idk. I'm just passing along info. Failing one drug test doesn't seem like he should be untouchable, but the fact that no one else took a chance on him either makes it seem like there's something more to it."
Saints,34i9ge,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 21:28:25 2015 UTC,They just said on ESPN that he was 90 minutes late for his meeting with the saints
Saints,34i9ge,Lokipokie504,1 point,Sat May 2 01:32:52 2015 UTC,And then just didn't show to the next 3 meetings. I guess that explains why he was the last kid in the green room.
Saints,34i9ge,saoXcore,-1,Sat May 2 01:53:11 2015 UTC,"I really want DGB so I keep hoping you are wrong, but after the Peat pick I definitely believe you.   Sigh.."
Saints,34i9ge,mallen12132,2,Fri May 1 15:07:46 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely love Diggy or Preston Smith. Diggy is the better of the two at defending the run however Smith is a much better rusher and we need help with both so I'd be happy with either.  Not a fan of Harold but in the 2nd, definitely of value and wouldn't complain too much neither."
Saints,34i9ge,ashsky,3,Fri May 1 15:25:22 2015 UTC,Could use that 4th on La'el
Saints,34i9ge,quantumhed,3,Fri May 1 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'd use a 3rd on him if there at 75,78."
Saints,34i9ge,VegasSaint9,1 point,Fri May 1 17:53:01 2015 UTC,not any more
Saints,34i9ge,dubya_a,1 point,Fri May 1 18:06:02 2015 UTC,Bruce Irvin is too much of a hot head for the Saints.
Saints,34j300,VegasSaint9,3,Fri May 1 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"I think picks 44 and 75 will be both defensive linemen with pick 78 being a WR or a TE. There's also a small possibility that 78 could be a QB (Petty or Grayson if they're still on the board), but it's a remote chance."
Saints,34j300,baconlovr,1 point,Fri May 1 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think a QB in round 3, maybe 75, but likely 78. Though if Petty is gone we could see something entirely different."
Saints,34j300,kweeche,2,Fri May 1 16:31:40 2015 UTC,My friend with a source told me that if Smith is there we will definitely draft him. He said to look out for Frank Clark or Kikaha in the 3rd.
Saints,34j300,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 1 16:31:04 2015 UTC,Nice call
Saints,34j300,Briguy_fieri,2,Sat May 2 00:18:22 2015 UTC,'Twas my friends source. I take no credit lol
Saints,34j300,Lokipokie504,1 point,Sat May 2 00:22:00 2015 UTC,If he's on the board at 44 we'll see.
Saints,34j300,swamptech,2,Fri May 1 16:56:44 2015 UTC,3 picks....could any of these make a splash/impact in 2015
Saints,34j300,jackmuhswag,2,Fri May 1 19:11:14 2015 UTC,We're not taking Gregory or Dawson. I doubt Green-Beckham. La'El if he's there in the 3rd would be amazing. If you hit on him then you just got the steal of the draft. Just dont sign him until BR police say he's not a suspect.
Saints,34j300,Mudkipz137,1 point,Fri May 1 19:58:23 2015 UTC,What time does it start?
Saints,34j300,ImShadier,2,Fri May 1 20:27:03 2015 UTC,6 PM Central.
Saints,34j300,Mudkipz137,2,Fri May 1 18:14:06 2015 UTC,"6?  I'm on west coast of course dang it.  You know come to think of it, I'm not feeling so well. I think I may be getting sick at approximately 4:00........"
Saints,34h9iq,Saints2Death,37,Fri May 1 03:24:03 2015 UTC,So glad we addressed the ILB position. This was definitely a huge need after losing Lofton.
Saints,34h9iq,EternalWitness,27,Fri May 1 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"I am not upset with these picks. But I am not excited. Frankly, that may be a good thing. I could see both of these guys starting day one. I see little downside. At worst, Peat becomes a guard and Anthony is just making form tackles."
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,29,Fri May 1 03:28:34 2015 UTC,"both of your ""at worst"" scenarios would be an upgrade"
Saints,34h9iq,psquared85,13,Fri May 1 03:31:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Like they aren't ""game changers"" but they definitely avoid ""game loser"" moments we had last year."
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,6,Fri May 1 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"I do think Anthony has that potential, though."
Saints,34h9iq,ImShadier,3,Fri May 1 03:37:24 2015 UTC,We just need them to be solid starters.
Saints,34h9iq,psquared85,6,Fri May 1 03:37:47 2015 UTC,I think Anthony could easily be a game changer and Peat instantly improves our line.
Saints,34h9iq,fittitthroway,1 point,Fri May 1 03:51:17 2015 UTC,Why a game changer?
Saints,34h9iq,Rudy_was_offsides,1 point,Fri May 1 10:43:57 2015 UTC,"His size, speed and instinct not to mention we will finally have a LB that can cover a tight end."
Saints,34h9iq,jaredb45,1 point,Fri May 1 16:26:12 2015 UTC,"I don't see Anthony as a game changer at all, but I agree that he'll proably be solid"
Saints,34h9iq,VanLupin,3,Fri May 1 11:40:54 2015 UTC,"We went young, smart, and athletic with Anthony. We needed that being one of the oldest teams in the league. He is very intelligent and can run that defense from week 1 at the ILB position."
Saints,34h9iq,dean815,2,Fri May 1 14:02:45 2015 UTC,Apparently he isn't too shabby in pass coverage.
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,12,Fri May 1 03:41:33 2015 UTC,Wouldn't hate Kendricks at 44 as well. Pass rush need is overrated. Galette jordan and Hicks are all good pass rushers
Saints,34h9iq,Armanewb,9,Fri May 1 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Ryan can get us pass rush. Hell, if we can cover Cam and Jordan can get to the QB."
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,15,Fri May 1 03:35:29 2015 UTC,Cam AND Jordan? Clone wars!
Saints,34h9iq,brandonie187,13,Fri May 1 03:58:07 2015 UTC,Well look whose sober over here. Narc...
Saints,34h9iq,TacoExcellence,11,Fri May 1 03:59:45 2015 UTC,Might have been available later on but still a solid pick. Very happy with this 1st round
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,13,Fri May 1 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"You say that, but clearly the Saints felt he was better than Kendricks. I doubt they were the only ones. Media analysts don't know everything. I'm happy with the pick, we got the position we needed help at and clearly got the guy our FO wanted."
Saints,34h9iq,serenity_suppository,4,Fri May 1 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"Hey, 31 picks passed on him."
Saints,34h9iq,TacoExcellence,14,Fri May 1 03:40:36 2015 UTC,first ILB still
Saints,34h9iq,nola_mike,4,Fri May 1 03:45:02 2015 UTC,"But he's the first ILB suggesting other teams either had other positions of need, or felt he wasn't BPA. Now don't get me wrong, maybe Kendricks will turn out to be better, but we got the guy we wanted. Can't complain about that."
Saints,34h9iq,brokenearth02,5,Fri May 1 04:10:06 2015 UTC,Green Bay needed an ILB badly and they passed on him.
Saints,34h9iq,Datchicagobayouboy,4,Fri May 1 06:49:20 2015 UTC,They also passed on Kendricks too. They picked a FS
Saints,34h9iq,brokenearth02,4,Fri May 1 13:09:30 2015 UTC,Green Bay plays in a division where their need of a solid secondary outweighs their LB needs.
Saints,34h9iq,Bunnyhat,3,Fri May 1 13:47:21 2015 UTC,And we don't? :)
Saints,34h9iq,VegasSaint9,3,Fri May 1 13:49:47 2015 UTC,We have a solid secondary now if everyone remains healthy.
Saints,34h9iq,Naly_D,2,Fri May 1 17:35:14 2015 UTC,"We got to pick from the entire group of ILBs so that was a plus. I'm guessing they didn't feel he would be there, or a decent player would be there either."
Saints,34h9iq,pottersquash,2,Fri May 1 05:34:24 2015 UTC,5th year option though.
Saints,34h9iq,jaredb45,21,Fri May 1 12:40:52 2015 UTC,Safe pick.  HAS PAYTON LOST HIS BALLS?!?!?
Saints,34h9iq,bacchusthedrunk,3,Fri May 1 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"No, he is just using his brain."
Saints,34h9iq,Number-91,3,Fri May 1 14:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ireland's possible influence coming through. Dude couldn't coach, but he could draft."
Saints,34h9iq,twstr709,10,Fri May 1 14:44:23 2015 UTC,He ran a fast 40 and our LBs were so slow. hopefully he brings explosiveness to the position
Saints,34h9iq,unfair57,4,Fri May 1 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Word is that Houston was trying to trade up to nab him, but backed off when we chose him."
Saints,34h9iq,hubristichumor,26,Fri May 1 03:35:18 2015 UTC,Well it would have been kind of dumb for them to trade up after he was already selected.
Saints,34h9iq,smilefortony,3,Fri May 1 04:01:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, as long as they could trade up and pick him within 5 picks of the time we picked him then it's possible our GM's select someone for trial by combat to see who gains rights to him.  Let's just be glad it wasn't the Colts looking for a trial by combat."
Saints,34h9iq,Jthan254,4,Fri May 1 14:55:14 2015 UTC,Why do you guys think they picked Anthony over Kendricks? Just curious.
Saints,34h9iq,daybreaker,12,Fri May 1 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"No clue. Maybe something during an interview. Maybe something about his play style fits our needs more. For me, Kendricks is better between the tackles, Anthony has better range and instincts outside. That may be a factor."
Saints,34h9iq,shame_les,9,Fri May 1 03:49:31 2015 UTC,This may be the key. We always talked about how our linebackers were too slow and not athletic enough to cover. Payton also mentioned that Anthony showed great leadership while he was at Clemson. He was their Curtis Lofton. The leadership and athletic ability may have placed him above kendricks.
Saints,34h9iq,Casual_Bandit,4,Fri May 1 04:11:46 2015 UTC,"If we got a faster Curtis Lofton, then this pick is amazing."
Saints,34h9iq,Zzzonked_Out,1 point,Fri May 1 12:36:40 2015 UTC,Pick is what?! OP plzzzz
Saints,34h9iq,Emperor_of_Orange,3,Fri May 1 23:02:25 2015 UTC,Guess Rob liked him better than Kendricks. We'll see.
Saints,34h9iq,neovenator250,8,Fri May 1 04:04:17 2015 UTC,Thought we could have drafted him 13 picks later.
Saints,34h9iq,Emperor_of_Orange,18,Fri May 1 03:27:48 2015 UTC,When the packers passed on him they probably planned on trading up in the second to get him. Smart to take him here.
Saints,34h9iq,superduperpooperman,7,Fri May 1 03:44:28 2015 UTC,what are YOU doing in here? ;)
Saints,34h9iq,Emperor_of_Orange,20,Fri May 1 05:03:24 2015 UTC,Talking about a Clemson player
Saints,34h9iq,jaredb45,3,Fri May 1 05:16:24 2015 UTC,tells us more about stephone please
Saints,34h9iq,neovenator250,5,Fri May 1 08:33:47 2015 UTC,"He's a very smart player that specializes in run defense. His coverage skills are a bit raw but they can easily be fixed. He could be a great MLB. Also, he's fast, strong, and big."
Saints,34h9iq,VegasSaint9,3,Fri May 1 13:17:28 2015 UTC,Run D is one major thing we have been lacking for a while so thats great to hear.
Saints,34h9iq,duncan345,2,Fri May 1 14:05:19 2015 UTC,"yeah, I know.  I was more surprised by how long it took me to find you than anything"

Saints,34h9iq,djmcintyre,2,Fri May 1 05:35:24 2015 UTC,Oh hey guys. Fancy seeing you here.
Saints,34h9iq,wicketRF,3,Fri May 1 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"I, like many others, would have preferred other ILBs over Anthony, but he's a Saint now, and I wish him all the best. We need anyone who can tackle, period.  I hope we draft at least one other ILB tonight to play next to him. There are 4 very good ones still on the board (Kendricks, McKinney, Dawson, Perryman)."
Saints,34h9iq,hubristichumor,2,Fri May 1 11:21:23 2015 UTC,"I'd kinda like to see em still take Perryman if he's available, it'd be nice to put a big run stopper next to the quicker ILB. But I also still want us to get a WR, maybe an edge rusher and someone at corner  I feel like today is going to be as exciting as yesterday"
Saints,34h9iq,MistaChopstix,4,Fri May 1 13:15:23 2015 UTC,"not really happy with this pick tbqh. Between him, Denzell Perriman and Eric Kendricks one of em wouldve been available at 44. 3 picks today though, use em well and it could still be a high impact draft.  Also good to note I think we have 2 day 1 starters I think. So even when im not nuts about the anthony pick its a very direct way to improve the team in both the short and long run"
Saints,34h9iq,jacksandwich,2,Fri May 1 07:57:59 2015 UTC,Well then maybe 1 of either Perriman or Kendricks is still available at 44.  Gotta let the draft play out a bit before we start questioning too much.
Saints,34h9iq,MistaChopstix,2,Fri May 1 14:58:17 2015 UTC,Was Eric Kendricks still on the board?
Saints,34h9iq,ashsky,3,Fri May 1 03:28:06 2015 UTC,yea
Saints,34h9iq,ikel123,13,Fri May 1 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"The FO knows more than me. I approve of this pick tho. He would've been my 2nd choice if kendricks was selected before,  but oh well."
Saints,34h9iq,CallMeGerbraldo,-5,Fri May 1 03:30:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like Kendricks, Dawson and Perryman are all better players. Then there's Gregory and Owa too.. Kinda sad with the choices today. Unfortunately, going to be pessimistic going into the season but it could turn out well, who knows."
Saints,34h9iq,ashsky,9,Fri May 1 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"Just remember this, Sean and the FO know what they are doing. Don't be too worried!"
Saints,34h9iq,serenity_suppository,2,Fri May 1 03:37:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this is their JOB. They have all the info I think we can trust them to make the best pick possible."
Saints,34h9iq,hubristichumor,-1,Fri May 1 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is, we have been absolutely horrendous drafting in the first round since Payton has been in charge. I'm more inclined to worry than not at this point especially after drafting two players I personally didn't rate so highly :/"
Saints,34h9iq,VanLupin,11,Fri May 1 03:39:58 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say we've been THAT horrendous.  Cam Jordan is solid, Jenkins was solid as fuck, Reggie Bush was instrumental to the '09 run, Meachem was meh, Cooks looks good, Sedrick was a decent starter for years  Some pop, some bust, some average.  that's how it goes"

Saints,34h9iq,didntevenwarmupdho,8,Fri May 1 15:03:35 2015 UTC,"True, on the other hand the highest we have drafted a LB in the Sean Payton era was Martez Wilson in the 3rd round. Maybe drafting a LB with 1st/2nd round talent will pay off?  We barely ever draft LB's and they are usually late round reaches (like Fortt and Powell last year)."

Saints,34hcil,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Fri May 1 21:13:35 2015 UTC,"From the press conference Payton very clearly said that initially no one was moving to guard, but that just means all three will be competing for the two tackle spots in training camp. Someone might move inside, or we might draft a guard tonight. Who knows. But no one has said that it's 100% sure that none of those three will be moved inside in 2015."
Saints,34hcil,Saints2Death,-3,Fri May 1 21:32:11 2015 UTC,"I posted in the other thread but got downvoted. I have a friend who was almost drafted and runs in circles with NFL players. He says that no one in the NFL is impressed with armstead. They think he isn't that good, and that he was a project player that the saints are not happy with the turnout. It's entirely possible, in his words, that we move on from him."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,7,Fri May 1 12:49:24 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a difficult person,  but I must say that knowing a guy who almost got drafted speaking for everyone in the NFL about the skill set of armstead isn't going to carry much sand.   Armstead is pretty good.  There's plenty of film,  and anonymous guys with questionable connections about loosely generalized banter is not much of hard hitting analysis.   Saying that,  I agree he is not top 5, but I believe he is top ten,  but that's my opinion. Peat,  I think,  will give armstead the opportunity to move to the strong side and use his athleticism to run sweep blocks and screens.   But.  Opinion."
Saints,34hcil,bobbyblack,1 point,Fri May 1 13:03:23 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Armstead is better suited to be a RT. I am not worried about LG. its the only weak spot on the line and we will have time in camp/preseason to find our guy there.

However, all signs point to him being right. If Payton is saying neither is kicking inside, there's 0 chance IMO that Streif plays a 6th lineman for 4 years (the length of his remaining contract). So I'm starting to lean towards him being right."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,3,Fri May 1 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't see it.    You seemed pretty surprised that people would downvoted you for citing a source like that.  Agree or not,  reddit is pretty downvoted happy,  and citing questionable sources and insanely vague statements like ""nobody in the NFL thinks he's good""  is why it got downvoted.   Whatever your or my opinion,  few people are going to give much credence to that kind of sourcing.   Again,  I was only attempting to cite causen8f said downvotes."
Saints,34hcil,bobbyblack,1 point,Fri May 1 13:22:20 2015 UTC,"As for armstead's perceived talent level,  we will have to wait and see.    I've watched Payton insist Jason David was good and Chris Ivory was not. We all see what we see.   Peat though,  watching film on him,  was a good pickup.  Dude is a monster as far as size and strength go.  He played at left tackle for all the highlights I caught.  IMHO,  armstead could move to right tackle soon and use his highly touted speed and agility to break some serious running room for Spiller.  Strief is the expendable one to me.  He's solid, and can move positions easier than the others."
Saints,34hcil,bobbyblack,-2,Fri May 1 13:28:16 2015 UTC,"I was just trying to add to the discussion. People don't have to believe my source (he was a 4 year starter at southeastern, and he is still very close to horford from Atl as they were both DB's there at the same time), but they can at least listen to what I'm saying. Whether or not they agree with me, they can at least hear it and discuss it rather than downvote. I understand that it's a norm on reddit to downvote what you disagree with, but I'm not trying to dog out armstead. I really like him and was looking forward to what he could do next year. I'm just telling you what my good friend said, and the signs are there for him to be right."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 13:27:44 2015 UTC,For real.  You don't have any explaining to do.  I was pointing out reddit's tendencies for down voting.  Not mine.

Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 14:11:01 2015 UTC,"Understood.   What came to mind for me was how brutal some of these guys are on people like Adam schefter,  and his type.

Saints,34hcil,bobbyblack,1 point,Fri May 1 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"Well my friend that has a source inside the org. (Not my football player friend, my friend who said we were picking peat), says that if Smith falls to us in the second we're picking him for sure. He also said to watch out for us getting Kikaha or Frank Clark in the 3rd. He told me that Harold has a health red flag? Which was news to me."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"If Streif loses his starting spot, what can he do? He can ask to be traded, but this isn't soccer where you can just hand in a transfer request. It's not like he can refuse to play, since he'd be a backup anyway..."
Saints,34hcil,Rekyht,1 point,Fri May 1 13:44:31 2015 UTC,"They just signed Streif to a 5 year 20 million dollar contract extension last year. Now granted, it's only like 9 mil guaranteed, but I still don't think they draft a tackle and make Streif a back up after a contract extension like that."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"Thats fair, but you never truly know who you're going to draft until the pick is in, Despite that, I hadn't considered that yeah, his contract will take up needless space on our salary cap, for a backup tackle.   I think Peat seems a very good player, but i'm not entirely sure he hasn't given us more problems than we've solved.."
Saints,34hcil,Rekyht,0,Fri May 1 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I didn't agree with my friend. But since Payton has said the Peat will play tackle, and neither Streif nor armstead are moving inside, it does seem like he is right."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"Possibly, the only reason I can't believe it is because I think Armstead has been absolutely fantastic apart from that very first start against Carolina, you don't get many o lineman that can run a 4.6 40yd dash.   I think long term, he offers us a lot more at RT than an aging strief can."
Saints,34hcil,Rekyht,1 point,Fri May 1 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"Once again, I agree completely. My friend and I argued about it for a good 5 minutes. I'm just relaying information that I heard from a friend of mine who is not a liar. Whether it's true or not remains to be seen."
Saints,34hcil,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 1 14:10:04 2015 UTC,"I couldn't see either Strief or Armstead stepping down. I thought we needed a guard,to replace grubs, over a tackle, but both of tackles did not play all 16 games. Both armstead and Strief missed some playing time. Andreus gives us the benefit of not missing a step on our offensive line if Armstead or Strief gets injured.   As far as guard, we still have the rest of the draft to pick one up. Whoever is our guard would be highly supported with Unger on one side and Armstead/Peat/Strief on the other."
Saints,34hcil,Jthan254,2,Fri May 1 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"It's nice to have depth, but I'm scratching my head to as why we would spend the 13th pick on someone we plan on benching?"
Saints,34hcil,smilefortony,1 point,Fri May 1 09:27:04 2015 UTC,"I would assume that at some point this season, Strief will become the primary 6th lineman, and Peat will take over at RT. Peat is a natural RT right now, as an awesome run blocker, and has the potential to become a franchise LT if Armstead regresses or leaves in FA in the future."
Saints,34hcil,InappropriateHandle,2,Fri May 1 11:30:27 2015 UTC,"From what i'm reading, I think we're gonna switch Armstead to the right, and have Peat at LT. Either way I think it's a significant upgrade to our line, and i've said for a few months that the best way to prepare us for a future without Brees is to start work on the O line and defense, and this is a great step, in the meantime, protecting Brees is one of the important steps in getting us to another superbowl."

Saints,34gxli,pgatkins,13,Fri May 1 04:41:09 2015 UTC,"Here's Walter Football's write-up. They ranked him as their #2 OT.  Andrus Peat*, OT, Stanford  Height: 6-7. Weight: 313.  40 Time: 5.18.  Projected Round (2015): 1.  4/27/15: In speaking with sources, it sounds like Peat has a wide range on where he could go during the first night of the 2015 NFL Draft. Peat could be a potential top-16 pick, or he could slide into the 20s.   Generally, Peat is a reliable in pass protection and solid in run blocking. He needs to improve his knee bend as he can get caught reaching too much. Still, Peat has excellent size, length and athleticism. He also has a strong lower body built to get movement at the point of attack. Peat had a good performance at the Combine.   Peat was impressive against Maryland to close out 2014. The Terrapins have some fast edge rushers who gave Iowa left tackle Brandon Scherff a lot of problems, so it speaks well of Peat that he was able to impress against Maryland. Peat did well in his matchup with talented defensive end Owa Odighizuwa in closing out the regular season against UCLA. However, Peat had some issues with penalties. Against Oregon, Peat was challenged more in pass protection and allowed some defenders to get upfield, but he didn't give up a sack. Peat did also well in the ground game. In pass protection against Notre Dame, he didn't have issues with the Fighting Irish's defensive ends. Peat showed his athleticism and quickness on a few plays.   Peat's game against Washington was similar to his performance against USC. Overall it was good, but he had a few plays where Huskies outside linebacker Hau'Oli Kikaha gave him problems. Generally, Peat won his blocks. He had a good game against USC in Week 2 and did well in his plays against Leonard Williams and was generally rock solid. However, Peat had a mental mistake on Stanford's last play that led to a sack-fumble for the Trojans to clinch their win.   8/27/14: Peat lived up to the big expectations in 2014. The first-year starter had an excellent debut for the Cardinal. In the ground game, Peat did a good job of opening holes and getting movement of defenders while also being a good pass-protector. He was All-Pac-12 Second-Team selection.   Peat has a ton of upside and last year seemed to be just scratching the surface of what he is capable of becoming. Peat has the size and athleticism to potentially develop into a high first-round pick and franchise left tackle.   Stanford moved David Yankey inside to guard in 2013 becase of Peat. He has a rare combination of size, strength and athleticism. Peat impressed when he rotated into the game last year."

Saints,34gxli,typical0,10,Fri May 1 01:43:04 2015 UTC,I think Strief could move inside to guard and be fine. We'll see what Payton wants to do.

I don't have a PFF sub, so I'm asking honestly, but Strief seemed like a liability more often than not last season, so I like the pick a lot.

Saints,34gxli,nola_mike,1 point,Fri May 1 02:30:21 2015 UTC,I don't have a sub anymore. His production has declined but so did everyone's production last season. Payton has confirmed Peat is a left tackle

Saints,34gxli,the_dharma_bum,6,Fri May 1 05:22:06 2015 UTC,Defending the qb is also important. I like it. I thought we would go OL at 31.
Saints,34gxli,nola_mike,3,Fri May 1 01:42:52 2015 UTC,i honestly would have been bummed if we didn't go Oline with at least one of the 1st round picks.
Saints,34gxli,Number-91,-13,Fri May 1 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"It never has been in the Payton era, and that is why we will all be watching another team playing for the Super bowl while Brees is wasting his final years padding his stats."
Saints,34gxli,sfzen,4,Fri May 1 01:46:29 2015 UTC,I get the pick. People wanted Dupree but it's too risky. Ireland mustve given Payton helpful information on who to go with. Maybe they can pick up Shaq on the way to 31
Saints,34gxli,rishiiiii13,3,Fri May 1 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"After taking Peat, I'd rather take a pass rusher at 31 and ILB at 44."
Saints,34gxli,Simplename64,4,Fri May 1 01:42:57 2015 UTC,"Having watched him play for Stanford for four years now, the man's a truck.  He's one of those rare offensive linemen whose names you actually recognize in college.  He was part of two Rose Bowls, three wins over Mariota's Oregon, and probably the best physical class Stanford's ever seen.  That offensive line took Kevin Hogan, the worst QB I have ever seen, and took him places that Andrew Luck never reached."

Saints,34gxli,JoeyJihad,2,Fri May 1 08:44:30 2015 UTC,If guy keeps our defense off of the field one extra play a game I am okay with the pick but yeah...it was just ok.
Saints,34gxli,garebearzzz,3,Fri May 1 21:14:18 2015 UTC,He is a good choice.  Physically he has a lot going on and he is young enough to learn from some veterans.  We need a big strong body up front.
Saints,34gxli,I_GROW_WEED,2,Fri May 1 01:40:11 2015 UTC,Physically he has a lot going on   Puberty?
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,3,Fri May 1 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"Went to high school with this guy!  Solid player, treat him right new Orleans! !!"
Saints,34gxli,dirdydirdy,2,Fri May 1 01:36:59 2015 UTC,"I wanted him.  Hope he's a bust for you bastards.  Seriously though, great pick.  Guy seems like he can make a difference immediately..and any extra millisecond you can buy Brees' goofy ass can make the defense pay."
Saints,34gxli,dean815,3,Fri May 1 03:43:57 2015 UTC,I like him. I think Peat was the best Left Tackle prospect. I'm wondering who moves inside and I see Armstead becoming a dominate RT either next season or when Strief is gone.
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 1 03:20:21 2015 UTC,Left Tackle is a gigantic need.  We aren't winning anything if Brees doesn't have protection.
Saints,34gxli,Bouzal,13,Fri May 1 12:30:46 2015 UTC,Suddenly Terron Armstead is garbage to everyone? He was pretty good last year. Maybe they pull him in to guard or move him to RT and pull strief in?
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,5,Fri May 1 01:41:53 2015 UTC,"He's not terrible, but he has always projected better as a right tackle where we can use his athleticism on screens and run plays."
Saints,34gxli,Bouzal,3,Fri May 1 01:39:44 2015 UTC,He's a great LT
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,0,Fri May 1 01:43:52 2015 UTC,He's like the 10th best LT in the NFL and most people wouldn't have in the Top 10. That's not great.   Moving to the right side he might be the best RT in the league.
Saints,34gxli,AgaliareptX,3,Fri May 1 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"What have you seen that makes you think he'd be a great right tackle? Not skeptical, just curious cause I don't know enough"
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,2,Fri May 1 01:54:09 2015 UTC,His straight line speed is wasted on the blind side. He'll be able to get way out front on screens and run plays to the outside. He also won't be going against speed rushers which have caught him up in the past.
Saints,34gxli,Rekyht,1 point,Fri May 1 01:56:39 2015 UTC,"I always assumed athleticism was better for LTs as they matchup against the better defensive ends.   If nothing else, I'm not sure I want to put a rookie against the elite defensive ends going after Drew's blindside, but I trust Payton."
Saints,34gxli,Emleaux,1 point,Fri May 1 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"It does to an extent, but I'm talking mostly about Armstead's straight line speed to get out if front of screens, pulls and outside runs. He hasn't been utilized on those plays, but now if he moves to the right side, we can take advantage of it."
Saints,34gxli,humanlikenick,10,Fri May 1 02:11:21 2015 UTC,Terron Armstead has been fantastic... Lt wasn't and isn't a need at all...
Saints,34gxli,smokeajay,4,Fri May 1 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, Peat will be willing to play G for the time being. His talent on the OL was something that Payton and Loomis couldn't pass up, based on the pick. They wouldn't have made that pick if they didn't already have something planned for any upcoming OL realignment."
Saints,34gxli,superduperpooperman,3,Fri May 1 03:45:38 2015 UTC,I think that's exactly what he will do. Play guard for a season or two then move him over to play tackle. Not an attractive pick but definitely a good pick.
Saints,34gxli,humanlikenick,4,Fri May 1 01:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think the opposite.  Peat will probably start at RT, Strief gets moves to G.  Or Peat will start at LT, Armstead moves to RT and Strief is still stuck in the middle."
Saints,34gxli,Emleaux,3,Fri May 1 01:54:16 2015 UTC,Ya armstead and peat will start.  ITT people underrating Peat
Saints,34gxli,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 01:59:23 2015 UTC,That wouldn't bother me either. I see an o line pick as a good pick.
Saints,34gxli,blackngold14,2,Fri May 1 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"Peat will have that ""young player just wanting to make the team (although I'm a 1st round pick)"" mentality to drive him to be on the field in any way possible. Learning to play G will help him do just that.  Not a sexy pick in any way, but the sex appeal was snatched up by the Jets, Vikings, Browns and even the goddamned Falcons. Peat seems to be the right decision."
Saints,34gxli,playfulbanana,0,Fri May 1 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"Armstead will make a much, much better RT. This was a great move."
Saints,34gxli,Rudy_was_offsides,1 point,Fri May 1 02:34:59 2015 UTC,ideally flips to right tackle and give us youth and tons of potential. Strief was a passable right tackle but this would certainly be an improvement. We should have two run blocking specialists bookending our line.. watch out for Ingram and Spiller in the flat.
Saints,34gxli,volstedgridban,1 point,Fri May 1 02:06:10 2015 UTC,He's been a monster since he was 16. I would physically look up to him as a 6 foot senior.
Saints,34gxli,nola_mike,-2,Fri May 1 01:49:19 2015 UTC,We now have a surplus of tackles and still have major holes on defense. Awesome.....
Saints,34hieq,ninjanoodle,9,Fri May 1 04:56:05 2015 UTC,"Please take him in the 3rd and now our O-line will be Super-Bowl caliber. Our rush offense would be insane, Drew Brees could get 1000 rush yards behind Armstead, Collins, Unger, Evans, Peat/Strief."

Saints,34hieq,Hedgery,1 point,Fri May 1 05:38:29 2015 UTC,Exactly. We had a lot of locker rooms problems last year and I don't see a reason why we would go in that direction.
Saints,34hieq,neovenator250,7,Fri May 1 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'd love to.  Of course, I'm 99% sure that he's innocent and I'm aware that others may not feel that way."
Saints,34hieq,quantumhed,5,Fri May 1 05:46:30 2015 UTC,"My concerns were put to ease when he tried to exit the draft and enter the supplemental. I think if he had something to do with this, he'd probably rather to get drafted asap."
Saints,34hieq,ImShadier,2,Fri May 1 14:18:24 2015 UTC,That was exactly my thinking. I go to LSU and I the players I know on the team say he's a great guy. I just think it's really messed up that his draft stock completely plummets just because of the speculation surrounding a case in which he is completely compliant.   And worst case scenario the FO can make a clause in his contract which makes it null and void in the event that he is found guilty just to cover their own asses.
Saints,34hieq,BootsBean,3,Fri May 1 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, but I think nobody wants to risk being the next team who had a murderer on their roster. Next druggie washout? Yeah, roll the dice, but murder's good for some crappy PR."
Saints,34hieq,dean815,1 point,Fri May 1 05:34:31 2015 UTC,"I hope to high hell we get him in the 3rd.  This shit popped up in his life at the absolute worst timing and will cost him millions.  There's no way he is guilty of it, he's barely in the investigation - anyone that had a relationship like that with a victim would be brought in for questions.  First round talent in the third is a steal.  If his innocence was up in the air then he's undraftable."

Saints,34hg21,makeplayz,1 point,Fri May 1 04:59:46 2015 UTC,it's honestly why I love this draft so much. Picking flashy seems like a sign of desperation. This just feels like we've done our homework
Saints,34hg21,nubosis,6,Fri May 1 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"After the initial shock of the Peat pick faded and I did a bit of research on him, I'm actually thrilled with our first round.  Anthony was the biggest, fastest, and most talented of the pure ILBs, and, after watching highlights and reading analysis, I truly believe that Peat will be providing consistent, above average play at LT for a long time to come.  I'm probably just looking at it through my implanted homer goggles, but that's my honest opinion."
Saints,34hg21,ImShadier,6,Fri May 1 05:26:10 2015 UTC,"Every team but the Bills and Seahawks are better than they were yesterday.    I didn't mind the Peat pick until Payton said there's no plan to move anyone to guard.  It's hard to get better trading away starters and drafting backups.  I think everyone likes Anthony precisely because he fills an obvious hole, which we could have done with 13 too."
Saints,34hg21,breaking_bum,3,Fri May 1 06:56:13 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I said it a couple of times in other places already, but why would we use the 13th pick on a position that we already have solid starters for? If Payton planned on converting Strief to guard, it'd make more sense. Sure we improved depth, but a high pick like that should be used on impact players who can start right away."
Saints,34hg21,smilefortony,4,Fri May 1 09:36:09 2015 UTC,"It may have been a bit earlier than necessary for both players, but the Saints got two guys I really wanted."
Saints,34hg21,whodat951,3,Fri May 1 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"Amen. Really was not happy with either pick but after sleeping on it, I think I can deal with Anthony but the Peat choice after saying nobody is moving on the o-line, has me really confused. I guess the front office really had him that high on their board?  Also, I'm EXTREMELY happy we didn't trade up. Thank the Lord. Was always expecting us to make some kind of crazy ass trade to move up for someone as we do so commonly but we didn't and that is fantastic."

Saints,34gy2r,PABLOricardo,12,Fri May 1 15:40:20 2015 UTC,Armstead made the all NFL under 25 team at LT. To think he hasn't worked out or isn't good enough to keep that position is laughable.
Saints,34gy2r,VegasSaint9,3,Fri May 1 03:03:30 2015 UTC,Dude it took him half a game to transition into one of the hardest positions in the game. Anyone who says he hasn't played well is wrong.
Saints,34gy2r,VegasSaint9,3,Fri May 1 04:15:19 2015 UTC,"It's not that Armstead hasn't played well. It's all about putting the best combination on the field. It could be Peat at LT, Armstead at RT, or it could be Armstead LT and Peat RT. Regardless of who we could have drafted better, we are a better team now than we were yesterday."
Saints,34gy2r,Smash_Brothers,1 point,Fri May 1 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know. I'd love to see Armstead kick out to RT. The O-Line should be solid for this year. Just draft a guard in the later rounds and now we're really talking."

Saints,34hbg3,jackmuhswag,5,Fri May 1 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Just reading their draft info, seems Kendricks is slower and less skilled in pass defense. Kendricks seem to be more ""nose to football"" and Anthony can be caught falling for ish but has speed to recover.   But this quote I think breaks it:    Because of his size, Kendricks will likely be shifted to outside linebacker in the pros, and many scouts believe he'll make a smooth transition to the NFL   Anthony is an ILB, Kendricks would be OLB. Saints lost Lofton but still have Galette. If they wanted in ILB, Anthony is the pick it seems.   The other rated high rated ILB Denzel Perryman has this flaw:   Perryman is shorter than the prototypical NFL linebacker and isn't the fastest, leaving him limited in pass coverage. He didn't help his stock in that regard with a 4.78 time in the 40 at the scouting combine   So if you are building a team to stop the Jimmy Grahams of the world (a thing we have to do now), an ILB with speed is a good move to go over a maybe pass rusher when you already got one."
Saints,34hbg3,pottersquash,1 point,Fri May 1 03:58:07 2015 UTC,That bit about Perryman's speed sounds way too familiar. Screw that.
Saints,34hbg3,ImShadier,1 point,Fri May 1 04:07:02 2015 UTC,Kendricks was much better in man coverage than Anthony. Their play speeds were essentially the same. I'm guessing they saw more potential in Anthony as a pure athlete and situational blitzer.
Saints,34hbg3,Phunkatron,1 point,Fri May 1 11:45:09 2015 UTC,"Kendricks is an ILB in a 3-4, no question. I think they see Anthony as a guy more able to shore up the middle of the field and I can't say I disagree. I'm still high on Kendricks but I like the pick."
Saints,34hbg3,dean815,4,Fri May 1 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Other than the ""liked him better"" guys, I'll add that he's a co-captain of the Clemson defense, which is important to have a defensive signal caller aka Vilma in the super bowl. Payton also likes him as a Mike linebacker. Most of all, he's a high character guy. I've also seen football people reference he has a higher ceiling than Kendricks but Kendricks has the higher floor."
Saints,34hbg3,typical0,2,Fri May 1 04:02:46 2015 UTC,Good points. Our team needs a long term leader. And I. Guessing that was the mindset here. I'm hoping in 2-3yrs Anthony has found his niche and is one of the new young leaders on defense.
Saints,34hbg3,mes8007,5,Fri May 1 11:51:53 2015 UTC,They had him graded higher?
Saints,34hbg3,agarret83,2,Fri May 1 03:44:05 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with them, but I can understand why. Anthony is much bigger, he's faster, and he's stronger. Hopefully they are right and he has my full support!"
Saints,34hbg3,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 1 03:53:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't keep up with the draft as much as I should, but can you explain why if Anthony is bigger, faster and stronger, why would someone want Kendricks?  Is it the football smarts?"
Saints,34hbg3,BooNala,3,Fri May 1 03:58:27 2015 UTC,"He has the ""it"" factor, and is very football smart. He had an ability to make big plays, and is as much of a ball hawk at the position that you can have. Great awareness and sure tackler."
Saints,34hbg3,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 04:03:03 2015 UTC,Anthony has extremely good football savvy as well. He was just overshadowed by Beasley on Clemson's defense. Over the last two years I have rarely seen him out of position.   He was the leading tackler on the nation's top defense last year and along with Grady Jarrett was the leader of the defensive unit.   He's not flashy and that seems to be the biggest issue I'm seeing that people have with him.
Saints,34hbg3,bverde013,1 point,Fri May 1 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"Better in coverage, better instincts at this point. But there is nothing preventing Anthony from being an every down player like there is with Perryman or McKinney."
Saints,34hbg3,Phunkatron,3,Fri May 1 11:45:49 2015 UTC,He's a very good linebacker and the FO probably liked him more than kendricks?
Saints,34hbg3,Emperor_of_Orange,1 point,Fri May 1 03:45:59 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong I love the pick. I just wanted to see if there was something I was missing.

Saints,34f0i3,agarret83,30,Fri May 1 01:36:56 2015 UTC,Can't complain about a pick to protect the QB
Saints,34f0i3,ImShadier,6,Fri May 1 01:35:36 2015 UTC,We had the top offense with shit protection last year. Get that unit together and we're talking record chasing.

Saints,34f0i3,neovenator250,16,Fri May 1 00:53:51 2015 UTC,Randy Gregory was NINETY minutes late for his meeting with the Saints and he just blew off his interview with the Raiders.  On top of everything in his background?  Is anyone surprised that no one is touching him?  Shouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole

Saints,34f0i3,chezizzle,14,Fri May 1 03:26:24 2015 UTC,you guys get mad over every pick. its hilarious
Saints,34f0i3,neovenator250,7,Sat May 2 00:14:23 2015 UTC,I don't hate this.  Like Grayson a LOT better than Petty.  I think we wanted Odighizuwa and he got stolen from us.
Saints,34f0i3,TheBionicShaboy,12,Sat May 2 02:14:56 2015 UTC,wtf gruden. armstead is a good player
Saints,34f0i3,saoXcore,6,Fri May 1 01:34:25 2015 UTC,"My exact response when he said that was ""ummm...what?"" Armstead is definitely solid."
Saints,34f0i3,AgaliareptX,11,Fri May 1 01:40:47 2015 UTC,"I can live with O-line, especially if Gregory or Ray is still there at 31."
Saints,34f0i3,EskimoPrisoner,11,Fri May 1 01:35:35 2015 UTC,A guy in another thread said he had an insider that said we would pick peat and petty. 1 down I suppose.
Saints,34f0i3,TheBionicShaboy,6,Fri May 1 01:37:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just thinking about that. I thought it was BS but...
Saints,34f0i3,Big-Zoo,24,Fri May 1 01:38:25 2015 UTC,Dirty Birds got Beasley... shit.
Saints,34f0i3,agarret83,19,Fri May 1 01:01:40 2015 UTC,He said it would be his dream to be a falcon.. I don't want that on my team
Saints,34f0i3,darthmouth,7,Fri May 1 03:00:06 2015 UTC,"""Have not drafted QB in first 3 rounds in 33 years"" wow that's impressive"
Saints,34f0i3,Megawatts19,7,Fri May 1 01:28:47 2015 UTC,I think Shelton was our guy but no one wanted to trade.  All the guys we wanted were gone so we went with Plan B.
Saints,34f0i3,colby347_1,3,Fri May 1 01:45:07 2015 UTC,And plan B is build a frickin wall in front of Brees.
Saints,34f0i3,August__West,6,Fri May 1 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"Surprising pick. But it makes sense. We're witnessing a total 180 when it comes to our offense. We were a pass heavy, run-to-keep-you-honest offense for so long. Now we're focusing much more on the run to set up our stellar passing game. We NEED to be able to run in critical situations which lost us a few games last year. I feel better about the pick the more I process it."
Saints,34f0i3,GroundlingX,5,Fri May 1 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Anthony was the leader for Clemson's defense and we definitely needed a leader again at linebacker.  This was a good pick for us.
Saints,34f0i3,KarmaPoIice,6,Fri May 1 03:51:40 2015 UTC,Led the FBS with 19 sacks wow
Saints,34f0i3,Breadmakesyoufatt,5,Sat May 2 00:14:35 2015 UTC,It seems like we had a very specific goal for this draft and that was to find a starting quality LB and a corner (or 2) no matter how many picks it takes. Love it
Saints,34f0i3,twstr709,18,Sat May 2 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the Falcons draft a kicker here, and he blows out his knees on his way to the stage.  Edit: Well Maybe Vic will change his mind about his football career and decide to fly to China and become a monk."
Saints,34f0i3,darthmouth,6,Fri May 1 00:59:32 2015 UTC,Interesting pick
Saints,34f0i3,colby347_1,6,Fri May 1 01:34:46 2015 UTC,Feels like we are playing copycat to the Cowboys last draft.   31st pick might determine the fate of the team.
Saints,34f0i3,jfox210,4,Fri May 1 02:00:54 2015 UTC,But they have the best O line in the league. Hate to say it but they did it right.
Saints,34f0i3,whodat951,2,Fri May 1 02:06:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and I love it.  As much as we, as fans, keep wanting us to draft defense, offense is our game.  It's what has been our bread and butter going back to even Haslett.  I am liking where this team is going.  Ingram hopefully is going to be like Deuce all over again, but with a seasoned Brees and a great offense.  Brees is going to have time to take a nap in that pocket."
Saints,34f0i3,jfox210,2,Fri May 1 02:16:39 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing.  When Dallas drafted Travis Frederick(right?) everyone was like, ""Who??"".  But you know what?  They had arguably the best O-line in the league, and Murray flourished.  Now it's Unger AND Peat in addition to who we already have?  I love it, and Brees is probably gonna have time to take a nap in that pocket.  Love it."
Saints,34f0i3,whodat951,6,Fri May 1 02:07:33 2015 UTC,Broncos are getting Ray I bet with this trade

Saints,34f0i3,JUST_ANOTHER_NOBODY,4,Fri May 1 03:25:14 2015 UTC,"That's a need, but he's definitely not the best player available . . . not even the best OLB available."
Saints,34f0i3,Saints2Death,6,Sat May 2 00:13:23 2015 UTC,Of course Odighizuwa gets taken the pick before us...
Saints,34f0i3,Guyote_,5,Sat May 2 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"P.J Williams, I'm content with that. Would make a quick nickel or dime corner"
Saints,34f0i3,danial133416,2,Sat May 2 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"I like him a lot aside from his off field issues, but I'm guessing the coaching staff didn't see it as a problem. So far I'm thrilled with our draft."

Saints,34f0i3,Breadmakesyoufatt,10,Fri May 1 02:30:41 2015 UTC,I don't know if you know this but Jahri Evans is pretty decent(awesome) too.
Saints,34f0i3,jberg624,4,Fri May 1 02:36:23 2015 UTC,My prediction: there will be a trade of some sort today and we'll draft someone that'll be a shock to most fans. I'm excited!
Saints,34f0i3,bootscallahan,2,Thu Apr 30 17:14:24 2015 UTC,This is a lock tbh

Saints,34f0i3,bootscallahan,5,Fri May 1 01:27:21 2015 UTC,Dupree it is then. I'm totally fine with that.
Saints,34f0i3,Mudkipz137,4,Fri May 1 01:27:39 2015 UTC,Fuck. I wanted Shelton the most.
Saints,34f0i3,GetCreativeOnMe,3,Fri May 1 01:28:35 2015 UTC,Ingram is really excited about his new OL mate hehe
Saints,34f0i3,Mudkipz137,3,Fri May 1 01:33:41 2015 UTC,This is fine.
Saints,34f0i3,TheBigO48,4,Fri May 1 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"22 picks in and Dupree, Gregory and Shane Ray are all still on the board  If one drops to us at 31 then Peat at 13 makes even more sense (not that it didn't make sense at the time) but getting the second best OT and a top 5 OLB would be a tremendous first round"
Saints,34f0i3,neovenator250,3,Fri May 1 02:28:24 2015 UTC,Did Thomas Davis just announce his replacement?
Saints,34f0i3,MUTGraphics,3,Fri May 1 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with our picks. Got somebody to help protect Drew and hopefully make our run game more dominant, ready for a huge season from Ingram.  And we addressed our ILB hole.  I know we didn't do anything crazy, but these were solid picks in my book. Not sure what we'll do in rounds 2 and 3 but still."
Saints,34f0i3,Smash_Brothers,4,Fri May 1 03:55:35 2015 UTC,"They might not be flashy picks, but I'm happy with solid, mature players that fill our needs right away."

Saints,34f0i3,ironheadsloofah,3,Fri May 1 00:58:35 2015 UTC,This pick favors us. We'll be running more this year so this guy isn't as big a threat to us.
Saints,34f0i3,TheBionicShaboy,3,Fri May 1 01:04:15 2015 UTC,Looking good for Dupree!
Saints,34f0i3,TheBigO48,3,Fri May 1 01:22:00 2015 UTC,Trade down to get Eric Kendricks. Trade 75th overall to get Mychal Kendricks. Use acquired pick on the first deal to get BDeffPA. Pick Agholor with 31th overall. Pick BDeffPA with 44th overall.  What you guys think?

Saints,34f0i3,ovivios,3,Fri May 1 01:38:50 2015 UTC,I don't mind this pick.  Running game and playaction should be money. Oline is never a sexy pick but the Cowboys did it last year with Zach Martin.

Saints,34f0i3,LegionPeep,5,Sat May 2 02:17:01 2015 UTC,You're my NFC team.  You've been more successful than us in recent years - but traditionally we were the ones stuck in the mud and trying to get better.  You guys escaped that...Time for us to do the same.
Saints,34f0i3,jberg624,3,Sat May 2 02:18:46 2015 UTC,We pick again right now. Hopefully it's Collins or even Olomu.
Saints,34f0i3,fnpenguin,3,Sat May 2 02:17:07 2015 UTC,This is not Collins
Saints,34f0i3,KingManlet,3,Sat May 2 02:30:49 2015 UTC,Saints pick OLB Davis Tull
Saints,34f0i3,Iwouldlikealongeruse,3,Sat May 2 18:23:33 2015 UTC,Another LB?
Saints,34f0i3,Simplename64,3,Sat May 2 18:24:34 2015 UTC,Very surprised we haven't taken a receiver yet
Saints,34f0i3,Guyote_,6,Sat May 2 18:42:41 2015 UTC,"I don't really think we need to though. We'll probably grab someone late, or UFA, but I think our receiving corp is fine right now."
Saints,34f0i3,darthmouth,7,Sat May 2 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"glad we didn't take Gregory, we didn't spend the offseason focusing on getting rid of bad apples only to take one in the first round."
Saints,34f0i3,dapricu,5,Fri May 1 03:28:56 2015 UTC,Tackle?! Seriously?
Saints,34f0i3,Smash_Brothers,4,Fri May 1 01:34:57 2015 UTC,I mean. We needed OL but couldn't we have found someone comparable at 31 or 44? I would've loved to have taken Dupree
Saints,34f0i3,darthmouth,4,Fri May 1 01:38:45 2015 UTC,Peat was the top lineman on some draft boards. So no.
Saints,34f0i3,GetCreativeOnMe,2,Fri May 1 01:42:09 2015 UTC,Let's get weird! I'm hoping for Dupree at 13 and some kind of move from 31!

Saints,34f0i3,bootscallahan,2,Fri May 1 00:49:08 2015 UTC,Do the Jets even need Williams?
Saints,34f0i3,ImShadier,2,Fri May 1 00:49:37 2015 UTC,It gives them the false hope of beating belichick and Brady.
Saints,34f0i3,ddoggie,2,Fri May 1 01:00:08 2015 UTC,I'm okay with Bud Dupree or Danny Shelton at 13.
Saints,34f0i3,darthmouth,2,Fri May 1 00:58:44 2015 UTC,Dupree scares me. I want a guy ready right now.
Saints,34f0i3,TheBionicShaboy,2,Fri May 1 01:00:40 2015 UTC,"Beasley is bad at stopping the run, we need to get better at stopping the run. Here's hoping for Danny Shelton."

Saints,34f0i3,infection151,2,Fri May 1 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"Part of me hopes we trade back. Wanted Shelton, and not a huge fan of Dupree or Parker. Trade back and see if we can get both Gregory and Ray late."
Saints,34f0i3,TheBionicShaboy,2,Fri May 1 01:29:28 2015 UTC,NO WR OR PETTY PLS!!!!!!
Saints,34f0i3,agarret83,2,Fri May 1 01:32:00 2015 UTC,Weird. Didn't expect that.
Saints,34f0i3,KarmaPoIice,2,Fri May 1 01:35:16 2015 UTC,Wow! Oline better be insane.  Seems we could have gotten later.  Gregory or Ray at 31 and WR in 2nd.
Saints,34f0i3,bootscallahan,2,Fri May 1 01:36:36 2015 UTC,I would rather have a good defense than a good o line. We need to upgrade our defense. Our offense was still top 5 in the nfl last year..
Saints,34f0i3,Smash_Brothers,2,Fri May 1 01:49:06 2015 UTC,Perhaps we trade up from 31?
Saints,34f0i3,VegasSaint9,2,Fri May 1 01:37:11 2015 UTC,It's pretty obvious now we are becoming a run heavy offense.
Saints,34f0i3,Smash_Brothers,2,Fri May 1 01:38:51 2015 UTC,Can we please draft someone that can tackle?
Saints,34f0i3,neovenator250,2,Fri May 1 01:52:49 2015 UTC,Tackles tackle
Saints,34f0i3,Simplename64,2,Fri May 1 01:56:30 2015 UTC,Holy shit Gordon was so giggly there
Saints,34f0i3,DwightKPoop,2,Fri May 1 01:54:46 2015 UTC,I have a slight hope that if someone is there at 31 who the Jets really want they initiate a trade for Wilkerson
Saints,34f0i3,djmcintyre,4,Fri May 1 02:11:49 2015 UTC,I'd take Wilkerson and a second for 1.31.
Saints,34f0i3,ClemsonPoker,2,Fri May 1 02:12:20 2015 UTC,I still want to trade the 75th for Mychal Kendricks and pick Agholor with 31st.

Saints,34f0i3,danial133416,3,Fri May 1 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"His numbers don't pop off the page because the Clemson defense got off the field about as well as anyone, but he was the leading tackler on the nation's best defense and a team leader. Great instincts and good speed for his size. I think you guys are going to be happy in the long run."

Saints,34f0i3,bootscallahan,2,Sat May 2 00:05:35 2015 UTC,Pls take gregory
Saints,34f0i3,MUTGraphics,3,Sat May 2 00:06:39 2015 UTC,I like it. Draft him and hire a personal babysitter to swat away any joint he sees Gregory picking up.
Saints,34f0i3,KarmaPoIice,2,Sat May 2 00:09:49 2015 UTC,What the fuck..
Saints,34f0i3,arithmeticulous,2,Sat May 2 00:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm dumbfounded, but here's some info on him sourced from NFL.com:  Strengths  Relentless. Bends the edge hard. Plays with his hand on the ground and stands up. Scheme versatile. Best fit is in 3-4. Intelligent player. Saw a streak of 14 consecutive games with a sack broken at Arizona in 2014. Excellent with his hands, possessing a variety of techniques. Was a judo champion when he was younger and a high school wrestler, so he understands hand placement and leverage. Good change of direction. Maintains low center of gravity on his rush without losing his wheels. Ability to recover and get back into a play.  Weaknesses  Can get swallowed up in the run game at defensive end. Has had knee issues in prior seasons. Perceived as a one-trick pony (pass-rush specialist). Upfield specialist and doesn't set the edge consistently. Needs work on playing consistently in space. Gets overly aggressive at times. Has had two ACL injuries and medicals will need to be scrutinized.  Draft Projection  Round 2 or 3  NFL Comparison  Rob Ninkovich  Bottom Line  Kikaha is the most accomplished pure pass rusher in this draft class. Relies on a relentless motor off the edge more than athleticism. He has an elite determination to get to the quarterback. While he seems to specialize in just rushing the passer, Kikaha has the power, hands and frame to improve against the run. It might take some work to get fully comfortable as a stand-up 3-4 OLB, but Kikaha is a very safe draft prospect as long as his medicals check out."
Saints,34f0i3,Smash_Brothers,2,Sat May 2 00:22:31 2015 UTC,I don't mind this pick at all.  High character guy with a good motor and work ethic.  Led college football in sacks.  I'm good with this one
Saints,34f0i3,whodat951,2,Sat May 2 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"Damn it...Jaelen Strong to the Texans.  Owamagbe is still on the board, though.  Could take him here."
Saints,34f0i3,VegasSaint9,2,Sat May 2 01:53:58 2015 UTC,I hope we go WR with the first third pick.  Need an upgrade.
Saints,34f0i3,whodat951,2,Sat May 2 02:03:42 2015 UTC,Owamagbe and La'el Collins?

Saints,34hdbe,ImShadier,7,Fri May 1 04:00:47 2015 UTC,"2nd round Odighizuwa, Phillips or Harold  3rd round CB and WR. Not sure who will be available."

Outside of those guys, BPA on defense at one of these positions: pass rusher, ILB (I'd have no problem taking another one), CB, D-Line"
Saints,34hdbe,neovenator250,3,Fri May 1 05:19:53 2015 UTC,Second round: Best Defender Available  Third Round: La'el Collins or another potential starter at guard and maybe a WR in Colston's mold.

Saints,34hdbe,Simplename64,2,Fri May 1 04:11:47 2015 UTC,Kendricks would be terrific.  I imagine we'd have to move up for him though.

Saints,34hdbe,chezizzle,2,Fri May 1 05:41:28 2015 UTC,If he still around in the 3rd (which he probably will be) I think we need to take a the risk at La'el. I would be so happy.

I like Collins a lot, but he's such a question mark right now. I don't know that I'd personally draft him before Day 3, but he's so good I wouldn't be upset if we nab him tonight in the 3rd."
Saints,34hdbe,InappropriateHandle,2,Fri May 1 11:26:04 2015 UTC,"I would love TE Maxx Williams at #44 if he's still there, but I have a feeling he'll be gone. Also on the offensive side, we could use a big, physical WR across from Cooks. Jaelen Strong would be awesome, but he also could easily be gone, as he was ballyhooed as a potential first rounder.  I really hope we pick up one other ILB tonight to play next to Anthony. We need multiple upgrades at the position, and there are at least 4 very good ILBs still on the board (Kendricks, McKinney, Perryman, Dawson).   An OLB or CB would also be good, but this is a shallow draft for CBs. I think Randy Gregory's pass rush potential and upside is well worth the risk if he's still there for us in the second."

Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 05:13:38 2015 UTC,Someone in another thread said he grabbed a boob.  Is that what really happened?  Because that seems more like normal obnoxious college kid than sexual assault

Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 15:43:13 2015 UTC,Don't perpetuate a myth dude. All he did was grope her. He got kicked off a team and spent a year in juco before going to LSU. That shit is behind him. That won't be the reason the saints don't go after him.
Saints,34hdbe,undress15,0,Fri May 1 16:22:13 2015 UTC,You seriously think a college student was arrest at a college bar just for grabbing a girl?
Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 17:51:53 2015 UTC,There is absolutely nothing out there saying otherwise. He was drunk in a bar and grabbed a girl. Assault is assault.
Saints,34hdbe,undress15,1 point,Fri May 1 21:03:13 2015 UTC,You're right. College students get arrested for grabbing girls all the time and football players never get away sexual assault ever.
Saints,34hdbe,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri May 1 21:08:15 2015 UTC,Sure it happens but there is no evidence at all playing it is any different. People get groped all the time and don't report it. If it is reported and charges are pressed then yea you can get arrested.
Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,0,Fri May 1 21:19:18 2015 UTC,So you hold something against a guy that he did several years ago for the rest of his career?
Saints,34hdbe,neovenator250,5,Fri May 1 05:15:49 2015 UTC,What's the statue of limitation on sexual assault?   Edit: the guy has a criminal record. This goes against almost every move we have made this offseason.
Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,0,Fri May 1 05:19:33 2015 UTC,I think enough time has gone by that he's grown up and gotten long past that.  at this point that was more than 5 years ago.  and he wasn't kicked out of school.  he transferred after getting kicked off of Georgia's team
Saints,34hdbe,neovenator250,2,Fri May 1 05:16:22 2015 UTC,"Kicked off the team, what ever. Still, trading for a guy with a criminal record is not really on par for what we've been doing this offseason."
Saints,34hdbe,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri May 1 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"honestly, it was more than 5 years ago at this point and he hasn't had an incident of any type since.  Far cry from a guy like Randy Gregory, IMO.  I'd take Mett for a 4th round pick in a heartbeat."

Saints,34f7jg,quantumhed,8,Thu Apr 30 17:21:58 2015 UTC,Why on earth would you want DGB?
Saints,34f7jg,Megawatts19,2,Thu Apr 30 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly with your sentiment, but the answer to your question is obvious.  If he's around late, I wouldn't mind throwing a pick his way.  Definitely not at 31 or 44."
Saints,34f7jg,sart0rial,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"Potential. It's worth the risk IMO. I've also seen a few interviews with him, he's surprisingly not an idiot, considering how stupid he's behaved."
Saints,34f7jg,sart0rial,5,Thu Apr 30 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sad that Mayock, Kiper, and McShay all mock Shelton to the Browns at 12.  I wanted him at 13 and the Kendricks brothers scenario via our two 3rd round picks."
Saints,34f7jg,baconlovr,3,Thu Apr 30 18:21:19 2015 UTC,"If we take Beasley at #13, I'll be very happy.  If we take Gree-Beckham at #31, I'll be very upset. If the police thing with Collins drops him that low, I think the Saints should take him at #31."
Saints,34f7jg,mallen12132,0,Thu Apr 30 19:09:45 2015 UTC,Why would you be upset with Green-Beckham at 31 but endorse taking Collins there?
Saints,34f7jg,baconlovr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"Position priority. We need a better O-line more than we do another WR. Not saying another WR would be bad, but we shouldn't draft one in the first round, or the second for that matter."
Saints,34f7jg,WiickedSF,2,Thu Apr 30 20:16:17 2015 UTC,True. Kenny Stills was a third rounder.
Saints,34f7jg,TacoExcellence,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:26:38 2015 UTC,Wasn't he a fifth?
Saints,34f7jg,WiickedSF,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"Ah yes! I stand corrected, 5th rounder indeed!"
Saints,34f7jg,baconlovr,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:14:46 2015 UTC,"We've proven we can grab dominate O-Lineman down in the late rounds. But the loss of Graham, for me, creates a greater need for a dominate red zone receiver."
Saints,34f7jg,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:55:05 2015 UTC,"True, but I'm seeing Josh Hill stepping up this year and us getting another TE/WR in the later rounds."
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:58:56 2015 UTC,"I wish a lot of the mocks I see would switch Dupree, uusally going to Atlanta, and Beasley, usually going to us."
Saints,34f7jg,oballistikz,-1,Thu Apr 30 17:34:51 2015 UTC,My friend has an insider to the saints org. He said there is a 0% chance we touch Gregory or DGB.   Edit: he also said we're going after Peat and Peters with our picks.
Saints,34f7jg,TacoExcellence,2,Thu Apr 30 17:57:04 2015 UTC,If your friend is an insider he would've told you not to say you got inside info.
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:20:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they keep this shit under wraps ever since we had Gregg Williams leaking picks to the media. No way does some random dude who works for the Saints know, unless his buddy is Mickey Loomis."
Saints,34f7jg,TacoExcellence,3,Thu Apr 30 22:05:24 2015 UTC,You were saying? Lol
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,2,Fri May 1 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! Can't argue with that. I hope you're right, I don't want DGB."
Saints,34f7jg,TacoExcellence,2,Fri May 1 01:39:43 2015 UTC,Just giving you a hard time. I wasn't sure if I believed him either lol
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 01:46:01 2015 UTC,"I've got to say, if we get both Peat and Peters I'd be pretty happy. I was worried we'd take Waynes."
Saints,34f7jg,TacoExcellence,1 point,Fri May 1 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"Another one of my friends who almost got drafted by the NFL. and hangs with players in the pros, said that the saints don't think the armstead project paid off. We might be moving away from him."
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 01:53:03 2015 UTC,Really? He's looked pretty good to my (uneducated) eyes. Problem last season was pressure up the center.
Saints,34f7jg,oballistikz,1 point,Fri May 1 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"I thought so too. I argued with him, but this pick makes much more sense if it's true."
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 01:55:54 2015 UTC,Media members know who is on the board and what rumors are and aren't true. His source could be a media member that the saints are a media partner with.
Saints,34f7jg,oballistikz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:14:03 2015 UTC,He did tell me not to say anything. I did it anyway
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,6,Thu Apr 30 21:23:27 2015 UTC,That's pretty Dickish dude.
Saints,34f7jg,oballistikz,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"He just said make sure no info about him gets out. He didn't even tell me the guy's name, so it's impossible for me to do"
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,3,Thu Apr 30 21:39:25 2015 UTC,Still that makes you both dicks. That's the insiders job. He trusted your friend and he told anyway. Then there's you. That's like being a dick2

Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:14:44 2015 UTC,I'm also intrigued to see how good my friends insider is.
Saints,34f7jg,nola_mike,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:22:02 2015 UTC,Pretty straight shooter
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri May 1 14:53:19 2015 UTC,I'll boycott this season if they draft a CB at 13.
Saints,34f7jg,nola_mike,1 point,Fri May 1 00:42:36 2015 UTC,"He was saying peters at 31, not 13."
Saints,34f7jg,mallen12132,1 point,Fri May 1 01:35:55 2015 UTC,"Regardless,  I hate the pick we made at 13 and we'll more than likely go DB At 31. All we seem to pick is offense and DB"
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,0,Fri May 1 01:47:14 2015 UTC,How reliable of a source is this friend of a friend?   Are you saying if Peat is there at 13 we take him and if Peters is there at 31 we take him?  I hope not.
Saints,34f7jg,mallen12132,3,Thu Apr 30 20:13:39 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/jDHyHfs  http://imgur.com/US0QJhm  I have no clue. He said he can't tell me yet
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,0,Thu Apr 30 20:23:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting.. I anticipate that Peat and Peters will be available at 13 and 31 respectively, so it will be intriguing to see if he's right."
Saints,34f7jg,mallen12132,3,Thu Apr 30 20:26:14 2015 UTC,1 for 1 so far
Saints,34f7jg,Lokipokie504,0,Fri May 1 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah really. Very interesting, on a selection no one else saw coming. Seems legit and made me look like a genius ;)"

Saints,34f6cb,quantumhed,8,Thu Apr 30 17:13:18 2015 UTC,"shit, I'd draft him at 31 if he falls that far. But that is only after a lot of research into the case to see the likeliness of him being arrested."
Saints,34f6cb,Saints2Death,11,Thu Apr 30 17:42:52 2015 UTC,Might be a real killer pick.
Saints,34f6cb,GreenVisorOfJustice,2,Thu Apr 30 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said. I'd do my due diligence to make sure he's not a suspect before drafting him, and I would assume someone from the Saints organization could get appropriate information from the BR Police Department."
Saints,34f6cb,Saints2Death,0,Thu Apr 30 18:09:15 2015 UTC,"I completely agree; just doing a little token trolling.  If he's aroudn in the second or third, I think it's worth a chance (or even at 31 if we can actually somehow get the scoop of what his involvement in this mess is and it's just some paternity matter).  Dude can fill a T and G depth issue we currently have and sure us up for the season (hopefully to become the heir apparent to Streif in a couple of years)."
Saints,34f6cb,GreenVisorOfJustice,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:21:49 2015 UTC,I thought it was a given that he would move to guard in the NFL? I think he was make a great LG for us.

Saints,34f6cb,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 30 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"If I had zero inside information, and that's all I knew about the case, I wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole."
Saints,34f6cb,Charizard_Targaryen,2,Thu Apr 30 22:45:34 2015 UTC,"If not for the whole Hernandez thing, yeah probably. With that fresh on everyone's minds and with almost no information yet available, I'd probably wait til round 5."
Saints,34f6cb,Charizard_Targaryen,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:24:25 2015 UTC,Is every saints fan a GoT fan too?

Saints,34f6cb,Saints2Death,3,Thu Apr 30 22:39:18 2015 UTC,"Then again, there's this to consider."
Saints,34f6cb,JUST_ANOTHER_NOBODY,3,Thu Apr 30 18:31:30 2015 UTC,Seems like an internal form of humiliation-discipline. I don't think that was actually a message to scouts. Not too bothered by it.
Saints,34f6cb,Breesus-Walks,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:31:47 2015 UTC,This. In what world do professional scouts get to wander around college facilities and would happen upon this list before talking to a coach about a prospect?

Saints,34ey9c,Lokipokie504,3,Thu Apr 30 16:17:38 2015 UTC,I don't doubt they like him. But there's a .00000001% chance we take him in the first.
Saints,34ey9c,Acipere,13,Thu Apr 30 16:26:05 2015 UTC,Anyone smell smoke?
Saints,34ey9c,Jthan254,5,Thu Apr 30 16:18:26 2015 UTC,I think that's exactly what I smell. Someone in the early 2nd round might be interested in Petty. Maybe setting things up for a possible trade.
Saints,34ey9c,sart0rial,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:25:22 2015 UTC,...or baiting someone to pick him earlier than anticipated to better the odds that our guy is there at 44.
Saints,34ey9c,baconlovr,13,Thu Apr 30 18:38:21 2015 UTC,Rappoport has been wrong about the Saints all offseason... why should he stop now?
Saints,34ey9c,Twistify804,3,Thu Apr 30 17:08:53 2015 UTC,Exactly. The only thing he was right about was the Graham trade. Don't trust him at all in regards to the Saints.
Saints,34ey9c,GroundlingX,4,Thu Apr 30 19:20:03 2015 UTC,I would be FUCKIN PISSED if they took QB with 31.  Another mediocre season incoming sigh..
Saints,34ey9c,whodat951,4,Thu Apr 30 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Saw Ian Rapport mention Bryce Petty going in the first to the Saints. From what I understand, real chance I get black-out drunk and spend the rest of the night crying."
Saints,34ey9c,Twistify804,2,Thu Apr 30 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Petty, but not in the first round by any means. Maybe with one of the thirds."
Saints,34ey9c,CallMeGerbraldo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Kinda similar to what the Pats did w/ Garoppolo last year. 3rd round QB, let him sit for a few years. I'm not saying that he would be as good as an Aaron Rodgers but I think he could do some great things in our offense, I like the Colorado State QB as well though. But nothing higher than a 3rd."
Saints,34ey9c,quantumhed,2,Thu Apr 30 20:32:47 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it and I hate the idea entirely. We have one of the greatest QBs of all time. Every pick should go to enhance that player's chances of winning, not ensuring we have a ""smooth"" tranistion following his retirement.  Besides, Brees is an ironman and will probably play at least as long as Payton or Favre. And I don't believe a decent QB can stay on the bench for 4+ years. If he was any good, chances are we'd have to move him anyway."
Saints,34ey9c,Rekyht,2,Thu Apr 30 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you somewhat - I do however think some picks should be towards gearing for the future, but those picks should be helping to set up a good offensive line and defense, so that almost any QB can survive when Brees retires. In the meantime, those exact same players could easily help Brees take us to a superbowl, so it's a win-win."
Saints,34ey9c,neovenator250,2,Thu Apr 30 17:44:42 2015 UTC,"God I hope not.  That would be a TERRIBLE pick in my opinion.  I don't particularly like Petty, but I wouldn't mind too much if they took him late.  In the FIRST ROUND?  That's insane."
Saints,34ey9c,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 30 20:45:12 2015 UTC,I don't buy this at all.

Saints,34ey9c,LSUsparky,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:17:42 2015 UTC,"This wouldn't bother me all that much. If Petty developes well behind Brees, we're looking at our next franchise QB. If we're hearing that he may go early tomorrow then we may be forced to act now."

I understand we have more immediate needs, but I think he's a good value for a guy who isn't a top pick. We've got to start thinking about a future qb eventually, and the more time he has developing in our system the better. Really wish we could get him in the 5th though."

Saints,34fyy4,undress15,7,Thu Apr 30 21:10:07 2015 UTC,Taking Dorsett at 13 isn't a reach?
Saints,34fyy4,quantumhed,0,Thu Apr 30 21:46:51 2015 UTC,might not be.  there's a lot of stuff going around that team sources are pushing him as a guy who should go in the teens.
Saints,34fyy4,quantumhed,3,Thu Apr 30 21:58:34 2015 UTC,"That's gotta be a joke. Most mocks don't even have him in round 1,  much less 13. Besides why do we need another 5' 10"" receiver that runs a 4.3?"
Saints,34fyy4,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:52:05 2015 UTC,a LOT of mocks actually have him in Round 1.  I've seen many that have mocked him to the Saints specifically.  Sean Payton reportedly fell in love with him at Miami's pro day and spent time afterwards working him out
Saints,34fyy4,Lokipokie504,4,Thu Apr 30 21:11:52 2015 UTC,"But shit, we just drafted a 5' 10"" speedster. Seems far-fetched to double up on that frame considering the loss of Graham."

He also said their ranking for LB goes kendricks (who they love), Anthony, then Perryman, in that order.

Give up one of our 3rds for Mychal Kendricks, and trade up from 31 with the other 3rd to take Eric Kendricks (or hope that he falls to 31). Then hope that they can take Shelton at 13 and that's a huge improvement to the run defense and defense as a whole. Would love to see it happen."

Mychal at 240 is an ILB in our 3-4 defense and would be competing with Ellerbe and Hawthorne at the ILB position. I'm fine with this they are old(both 29) and injury prone, but they have way to much money tied to them.  I initially thought our ILB corps would be crowded but then I remembered Humbar is garbage and doesn't count and we have zero depth to begin with.  Hawthorne is signed through to 2016 with 4 mil each yrs.  Now that I looked it up Ellerbe is scheduled to make 6.mil in 2016 an 2017, but It only becomes guaranteed on the 3rd league day of 2016(2015 still count against the Dolphins salary cap). If we cut him at at that time we would have no dead money at all, freeing up 6 mil to sign Mychal to a long term deal. We would have to use the franchise tag or let him hit the market for a day or two because we don't see that money until after free agency starts. This is only true if we are up against the cap, which is likely because Jordan and Hicks will need to be re-signed.  As far as improving we still need an upgrade at the Sam OLB position according to your plan. Other than that this move is far more feasible than I originally thought.  The 75th overall should be more than enough for Mychal. Use the other third to trade up for Eric."
Saints,34cbde,flordeliest,4,Thu Apr 30 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if these moves went down (trading for Mychal Kendricks and drafting Eric Kendricks), I would suspect that they either cut or trade Hawthorne (likely attempt to trade Hawthorne for a ""conditional 7th"" that they are unlikely to get just so they can avoid some dead money as they guaranteed some of his salary this year since he took a pay cut, so trading him would only result in an extra $510,000 against the cap than he currently is and cutting him would cost the Saints about an extra $1M against the cap than he currently is taking, although designating him a post-June 1 cut would actually free up an extra $1.2M in cap space for the Saints this year which might be an option too). Hawthorne should've been cut along with Lofton but he took a pay cut so they kept him, but I don't think he's good enough to start on this defense even if they just draft a rookie ILB within the first three rounds, so I wouldn't mind them cutting ties with him. Ellerbe is likely only here for one year unless he proves this year that they should keep him here beyond that and not cut/trade him next offseason, which would free up $4.5M in cap space for them next year.  So yeah, I don't think having Hawthorne or Ellerbe here really stops them from making this move because they either trade or cut Hawthorne, and then have Ellerbe and the two Kendricks fight over the two starting jobs at ILB, and potentially rotate Eric Kendricks with Ellerbe at one of the ILB spots to ease the rookie into a starting role. I'm more worried about this team at ILB and NT than I am about them at OLB, as I'm more worried about them improving those positions and helping to stop the run than I am in them getting another pass rusher, although obviously they could still use a pass rusher. Drafting Shelton and Kendricks and trading for Mychal Kendricks would instantly improve their run defense hugely, plus Shelton could collapse the pocket to help improve the pass rush and free up other pass rushers, while Mychal Kendricks has also been noted as a solid pass rusher from the ILB spot, while both Kendricks brothers are solid in coverage as ILBs, which is something that could very much help the Saints pass defense. Make these moves, and I guarantee the Saints aren't sorry that they passed on a pass rusher early, as the improved coverage plus Shelton helping to collapse the pocket and free up other pass rushers will be huge for increasing pass rushing productivity from Galette, Jordan, Hicks and others (Spencer, Edebali, etc.).  TL;DR: Sorry, I'm just so excited for the draft tomorrow. If Saints get Shelton as a NT at 13 and two ILBs in the draft, I will be ecstatic. If they happen to be the Kendricks brothers, even better."
Saints,34cbde,Hedgery,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"There is no reason to get ride of Hawthorne, he is making a reasonable 4 mil and his contract expires after 2017. Remember we have shit ILB depth, and the entirety of his 2016 contract year is guaranteed(only 2 mil guaranteed 2017). All of it will be dead money with zero savings if he is cut. This is because he restructured not took a pay-cut. I doubt he was ever in danger of being cut.  This drastically fixes our ILB problem, but we still need to upgrade the Sam OLB position. Haralson is still the starter, and his only capable back-up is Edebali, Who is more of a rush OLB and really Galletes back-up, and 2014 fifth round pick Ronald Powell, who has only seen special team time.  Its still a good move by all means a good plan but it certainly isn't perfect, we need to be realistic. We only need a to acquire a DT/NT and an 3-4 OLB with picks 13, 44. Which is more than doable. I'd prioritize OLB, because in the worst case scenario we commit to Jenkins as the starter NT and getting someone to rotate with him."
Saints,34cbde,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be more open to opening the season with Haralson as the Sam OLB than as Hawthorne starting at ILB. He's done a solid enough job at that spot, whereas Hawthorne (and Lofton) have been pretty bad up the middle for the Saints, and they need new starters at ILB. I'm interested to see how Ellerbe can do now that he's coming back to a 3-4 system that he played very well in before while he was in Baltimore, but Hawthorne is likely nearing the end of his time in this league, and when the Saints cut him after this season (if not sooner) I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't get another contract in the NFL.  That being said, as long as the Saints do something to improve this D, I don't care what they do, as long as it works. I'd prefer a better NT than Jenkins (i.e. Shelton) because a dominant NT can improve a 3-4 defense so much. So that's why I'd prefer Shelton over many of the pass rushers that will be available at 13 (Fowler, Beasley and Dupree will likely be gone before they pick leaving only Ray and Gregory who both have huge question marks now). Pass rushers are also far more likely to bust since often cases their one trick ponies, and if their pass rushing doesn't translate to the NFL from college, which happens to many of them, then they are very likely to bust. This is the main reason why I wouldn't mind if they pass on a pass rusher until later since I'm not sold on any of the pass rushers that will be available for them."
Saints,34cbde,Hedgery,-1,Thu Apr 30 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"In passing situations we use a four man front.   We don't need a pass rushing OLB, Gallete already plays the weakside, in our base 3-4 sets. We gave up, 4.8 yards per carry last year, so we didn't lose throw the air. I don't consider pass rush the issue with the defense. So Ray and Beasley are not options to begin with. We need a run support OLB to replace Haralson at the Sam in our base 3-4 sets. Starting the season with him there is out of the question. We have no one behind him  and planning to base the season on a 31y old OLB's health is ridiculous.   I'm not opposed to Shelton but not over Dupree, or though unlikely Fowler.  Shelton at 13 would mean getting a guy like Lorenzo Mauldin and Danielle Hunter at 44, very few OLBs in that range. The main difference is that  Dupree at 13 would give us far more flexibility because we can target both DT and NT at 44 freeing us up way more than targeting OLBs."
Saints,34cbde,flordeliest,-1,Thu Apr 30 05:41:53 2015 UTC,Both Ellerbe and Hawthorne took paycuts this offseason. They aren't getting cut this season.
Saints,34cbde,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:18:12 2015 UTC,If Ellerbe doesn't play well he is likely to be cut on the third league day of the next league year. It won't technically be in this league year. I have no plans for Hawthorne to be cut.
Saints,34cbde,flordeliest,-1,Thu Apr 30 04:23:31 2015 UTC,Are you talking June or March? I get confused with how the salary cap works in these cases.
Saints,34cbde,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"Its in march right when free agency starts, this is unique to his contract. Everyone else's is guaranteed on the new league year."
Saints,34cbde,flordeliest,0,Thu Apr 30 04:27:58 2015 UTC,I didn't know if it was tied into the June 1 cuts.
Saints,34cbde,Saints2Death,0,Thu Apr 30 04:29:03 2015 UTC,Hawthorne and Ellerbe took pay cuts this offseason. No way do either of them get cut without being injured.
Saints,34cbde,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 30 04:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely think you're right about that, but things change. If they got to the point where Hawthorne would be 4th on their ILB depth chart, I think he might be more open/accepting of getting traded/cut so that he might be able to go somewhere else where he can put himself into a better situation, although the Saints definitely wouldn't want to cut someone after they took a pay cut to remain with the team. Still think they should have cut him in the first place."
Saints,34cbde,Hedgery,-1,Thu Apr 30 04:32:08 2015 UTC,"Watson, Lorig, and Humber are the likely candidates to be cut if we have to. I think Hawthorne is fine at his reduced figure. He adds depth."
Saints,34cbde,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:40:46 2015 UTC,"Well cutting him doesn't open up any new cap space this year anyway (and they aren't going to cut Humber when they just brought him back on a 2 year deal with a decent amount guaranteed), but I was just thinking more they might as well cut him and move on from him  if he falls so far down the depth chart. At least Humber and Knox can make a big impact on special teams as depth ILBs, whereas Hawthorne most likely would not, and as a depth ILB if he's not seeing the field very often on defense or special teams (and when he does play on defense he is below average), then what's the point of holding on to him? I'm not going to be upset if they hold on to him as a depth guy, but if they're still planning on him being a starter then I think that's a missed opportunity to improve this defense when there are plenty of good ILBs in this draft."
Saints,34cbde,Hedgery,7,Thu Apr 30 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"I really hope we get Mychal Kendricks. Odds are he will have a more immediate impact than anyone we draft. He might be a free agent to be but we have plenty of cap space after this year. I like the idea of drafting his brother to play along with him and would probably help keep him here beyond 2015. With both being undersized for the position it would be best to get a big NT like Shelton to keep them from getting blocked by massive OLinemen.  Perfect world scenario trade #78/#154 for Mychal Kendricks. Draft Shelton at 13, trade 44/75 to trade up to 27 to take Eric Kendricks if he is still on the board, then take Odighizuwa to play SOLB. That would be a beast front 7."

Saints,34bzix,atn420,16,Wed Apr 29 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"I can't believe anyone ever thought we were. Our division is trash so we always have a good shot at the playoffs. We had a bunch of close games that didn't go our way last year, and a lot of game mismanagement on 4th down let us down. Our offense is still top notch because we have Drew Brees & we finally have the receiving RB we lacked last year on 3rd down.   With that said, we obviously need huge improvement on defense. A healthy Browner-Byrd-Vaccaro-Lewis secondary is impressive on paper. Our pass rush is young and was the bright spot of our defense last year. With improvement up the middle and maybe a nickel corner we will be a very scary team."
Saints,34bzix,clnsdabst,7,Thu Apr 30 01:11:57 2015 UTC,I remember during the whole Brees trade rumors that someone told me the Saints should trade Brees because it's upsetting that such a good QB is on such a shitty team and how he'll never get another ring if he stays in Nola.

Saints,34bzix,GenrlWashington,1 point,Thu Apr 30 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"Exactly. If the first Falcons, Browns, and Lions games all go the way they were supposed to and we do shoot ourselves in the foot, we are suddenly 10-6 and win the division. People aren't talking about rebuilding and are instead talking about how much better we will be the following year and how the division is ours for the taking once again.  Instead, giving up a few close games and making necessary off-season adjustments makes outsiders think we are selling the farm and starting from scratch. In Breesus name we trust."

Saints,34d01j,backgrinder,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:27:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like your basing your entire opinion on his game by one play. There is a reason he's considered by most professionals in the league to be the best QB prospect since Luck.
Saints,34d01j,ApolloXLII,1 point,Sun May 3 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your basing your entire opinion on his game by one play.   Why would you assume this? I've seen several games he played in in their entirety, and he always left me with the impression that he stared down his WR's too much and was clumsy footed when he tried to move around in the pocket. Great QB's all have great feet, quick and precise in foot placement, always balanced, always look graceful like a dancer when they move. Winston doesn't have that component and a lot of evaluators have commented on the same flaws."
Saints,34d01j,backgrinder,11,Mon May 4 03:07:42 2015 UTC,"I feel exact the same way. Mariota is almost a sure bust in my eyes. If Winston can stay straight (and I think his character concerns are exaggerated), he's a top 10 qb in a couple of years."
Saints,34d01j,Lokipokie504,-1,Thu Apr 30 12:51:16 2015 UTC,"They both have literally the same potential of bust, 50/50. Anything beyond that is speculation and opinion."

I would much rather have Mariota playing for my team than Winston. Mariota is like Brees and Wilson, he seems like a really good guy. Winston has shown in the past he's prone to making poor decisions. Those kinds of things might not catch up with him if he continues to do them, but for me it's not worth the risk. Especially when Mariota is just as good, if not better. It just seems like Mariota is way more focused on being a professional and Winston is just playing a game. This is just my opinion of course."
Saints,34d01j,makeplayz,8,Thu Apr 30 11:58:53 2015 UTC,"The way I look at it about the crab legs situation is like this: In college I worked at a Sonic drive in for 3 years. I still know people there and I still get free drinks all the time, occasionally free food.. If I were a college football player under a microscope with the media speculating on everything I did, all the fans would be calling me a criminal and a thug and I'd have character issues cause I know some people that give me something free.

They surfaced the week of the NCG, just like deflate-gate with the Pats. Media's gotta talk about something. He was cleared from everything because there was nothing there but the media trying to sell a story. And you bought it. Now your perception of Jameis is built on everything you've ever been told about him by the news and you won't take anything positively said about Jameis cause of your already negative perception of him. If you watch him, he's just a normal guy that likes to make people laugh and be the center of attention. Wow, he said ""fuck her right in the pussy."" over 100 million Americans have said that phrase. Get the fuck over yourself bro.

Saints,34aioi,bootscallahan,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"I don't have too much a problem with it either. Either we have a capable back-up that can learn and take over in x years or so, or good trade bait."
Saints,34aioi,DaveThe_blank_,1 point,Wed Apr 29 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"Garrett Grayson is better imho. Petty came out of the same 1 read system as rg4. Awkward release too. GG is accurate, great arm, size and smarts. Basically a prototypical qb, and under sp and brees tutelage he could be excellent. Comes out of a pro style offense and does multiple reads."
Saints,34aioi,fittitthroway,2,Wed Apr 29 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"I like him quite a bit, too. I just think Petty would be a good fit with the Saints because he wouldn't have to start right away ala RG3. I'd be just fine with Grayson though."
Saints,34aioi,bootscallahan,2,Wed Apr 29 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like if Petty or Grayson fall to the second round we'll pick them. Maybe even the third round, who knows."
Saints,34aioi,Acipere,4,Wed Apr 29 16:54:14 2015 UTC,I don't think we'll take one before the third.
Saints,34aioi,Megawatts19,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll take one at all this year. Most of these Qbs will need to be developed from basically scratch so as long as we don't need a back-up or we have at least 2 yrs left on Brees, then it seems like a waste. While we are developing them form scratch an UDFA is just as good as a draft pick.   Now a lot of this comes down to how Mike Neu is as our QB coach, its his job to develop a rookie QB not Brees. Brees does nothing for a rookie QB."
Saints,34aioi,flordeliest,2,Wed Apr 29 17:16:31 2015 UTC,Petty's rookie contract would probably expire before he even sniffs the field as a Saint. How does it make sense to draft someone in the second or third round and have him ride the bench until his next contract is due? Brees has anywhere between 3-8 years left so drafting a project qb that high is unlikely.
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,2,Wed Apr 29 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"Rodgers was the same way under Favre, sitting on the bench his first 3 years. Look at many of our young QBs in the league today. Most of the starters had no choice and were forced to lead. Some have excelled (Luck, Wilson, etc.), some have not (Manziel, RGIII, etc.). But you can't tell me that not one of them would have loved to sit under an elite veteran like Brees. That's why I think that Garoppolo (under Brady) and Osweiler (under Manning) will end up being spectacular QBs. Rest assured that whichever QB we draft, either this year or the next, will be well-equipped to lead the Saints once Brees retires."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,2,Wed Apr 29 17:44:38 2015 UTC,We're trying to make one final run at a Superbowl with BREES as our QB. Our depth issues are way too glaring to ignore them to draft some project quarterback in the second round. Brees has stated he wants to play into his 40s. That's at least another 4 years or maybe more. Even if Petty develops you think he's going to want to sit around for 4+ years to get on the field?
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,0,Wed Apr 29 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"Of course Brees is saying he'll be playing in his 40s, most veteran QBs think age is just a number. Look at Peyton Manning. Even he wasn't sure he was going to come back for one more season. And yes, I think  that Petty would be immensely grateful to be able to sit under Brees for however long he can. If he is indeed the legacy QB to replace Brees then he will eventually get to play as much as he wants. Mentorship and veteran knowledge are a precious commodity that shouldn't be squandered over impatience."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,2,Wed Apr 29 18:46:29 2015 UTC,There's a difference between sitting and learning for a couple years compared to not having a chance to start possibly until you're thirty. No competitive player will be willing to sit that long I'm sorry.
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,0,Wed Apr 29 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"Thirty? Petty's 23. Do you honestly think Brees will still be under center when he's 43? If we do draft Petty (that's a big IF), the average rookie contract is four years. And if Brees is still playing by then, I'm sure plenty of offers will come for Petty to start somewhere else, even if he hasn't gotten many snaps."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,2,Wed Apr 29 19:08:32 2015 UTC,"With the way the NFL protects QB's and how we're going to a heavier run scheme to protect Brees? Yes it's entirely possible he's still playing at 43.   And if Brees is still playing by then, I'm sure plenty of offers will come for Petty to start somewhere else, even if he hasn't gotten many snaps.   Then why waste a pick now for someone that won't see the field under the entirety of their first contract when were trying to get to the superbowl now?"
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,-1,Wed Apr 29 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"It's not wasted, it's insurance. If (Heaven forbid) Brees got injured during the season, wouldn't you want a very capable backup QB who has been under Brees the whole season to pick up the reigns and get a fair amount of wins while Brees recovers? When Rodgers broke his collarbone, Matt Flynn did just that. You always want the best possible starter AND backup you can get. It's not about catering to the backup's needs, it's about doing what's best for the team."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,2,Wed Apr 29 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Petty or Grayson will be any more capable of winning games compared to the backups we have now over the next couple of years. You're still ignoring the depth issues we have at so many other positions. A backup QB is not a need at the moment compared to Oline, Dline, WR, and LB."
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,0,Wed Apr 29 19:53:27 2015 UTC,"All drafted rookie contracts are four years, first round picks have a fifth-year option."
Saints,34aioi,Saints2Death,0,Wed Apr 29 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"It's taken the Packers 5 years since Favre's retirement to retire his jersey because of fan resentment and the fear that Favre would be booed. As a fan, I would not want to endanger Brees legacy by drafting the ""heir apparent"" too early and forcing Brees out of town."
Saints,34aioi,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:20:30 2015 UTC,Exactly. I don't get why everyone is so ready to draft his replacement. The guy already said he wants to play into his 40s. He still has quite of few years of high level play in him.
Saints,34aioi,KingManlet,0,Wed Apr 29 18:28:56 2015 UTC,"The fan resentment had little to do with Favre's performance or Rodgers replacing him. It was due to him going to the Vikings after he ""retired"". If Brees went to the Falcons, he would probably face the same reaction."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:42:38 2015 UTC,"If Brees doesn't want to go and is still performing, they'll choose him. Payton and Loomis aren't the kind that would run him out of town, and Brees means too much to this city, much more than Favre meant to Green Bay"
Saints,34aioi,Bouzal,0,Thu Apr 30 02:42:35 2015 UTC,"""Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain""  See Bobby Hebert, Morton Andersen, Sam Mills, Mark Fields, to name a few off the top of my head. I don't want to see Brees play in any other color, and drafting his replacement before he decides to retire almost guarantees that will happen."
Saints,34aioi,Saints2Death,0,Wed Apr 29 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"I don't see it that way. Granted, I do believe it's at least one year too early to be drafting a QB (Loomis will do what he does), but Brees has already stated he plans on retiring a Saint. Unless something insane happens between now and then (like getting less than 5 wins in back-to-back seasons and we trade him/mess with his contract), then I can't see that being the case. I am the optimist, though. I want to see Brees retire a Saint after we win one more Lombardi."
Saints,34aioi,baconlovr,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:01:05 2015 UTC,Maybe they know something we don't as far as Brees is regarded.

Saints,34aioi,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:14:30 2015 UTC,I watched Chris Bonner who is the qb from Colorado State Pueblo and the guy was amazing. If we could get him in a very late round or even possibly as a free agent then he would be a great player to sit behind Brees while he finished developing. It also helps that he is a giant and can take a hit.
Saints,34aioi,TheRealSugarRay,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"I want to wait and see where we are with Brees at the next draft before drafting the guy we see as the QB of the future, but I'd be all for drafting a guy whose sole purpose is to beat out Luke McCown or Ryan Griffen for the 3rd String QB job."

The best course of action is to wait for Drew to retire then be really bad one year to get a top qb. It's very rare for a team to have a situation like favre/Rodgers work out like it did for the packers."

Saints,34bcv7,whodat951,4,Wed Apr 29 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing. I'd rather stay put at 13. Some top end player will surely fall to us there.   If you account for the top 2 QBs, we're guaranteed one of:  Williams  Fowler  Beasley  Dupree  Gregory  Amari  White  Parker  Scherff  Shelton  Brown  I'd be perfectly fine with either if those guys. And would rather not give up picks."
Saints,34bcv7,Brees2Graham,2,Wed Apr 29 20:21:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think that Williams has the highest chance of being a superstar. I think he could be the spark our defense needs, and agree with the idea that we can't start nine rookies. Id rather spend a few picks on someone who has a huge chance of panning out as a pro bowler than get pieces that are raw or underperform."

I'm just absolutely certain we'll trade up because we do stupid shit like that but who knows."
Saints,34b93c,cfiggis,3,Wed Apr 29 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"God I really hope we don't take a WR in the first that isn't Amari Cooper, Kevin White, or Devante Parker."

Saints,34b93c,whodat951,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"Like every year, the draft will leave us both excited and a bit disappointed.  Serious prediction, though, we take a QB in the 3rd."
Saints,34b93c,Brees2Graham,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:18:03 2015 UTC,I predict these players will be Saints.   Owa Odighizuwa Devin Smith Eric Rowe Ali Marpet Senquez Golson Stephone Anthony  I think we will target these players but probably won't get all of them.  Probably 4 of the 6.
Saints,34b93c,cajunrevenge,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:26:23 2015 UTC,"That plus our 13th pick would be the best draft possible. Although Lorenzo Doss would be a suitable, and more feasible, alternate to Eric Rowe."
Saints,34b93c,whodat951,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"And when do you suppose we'll  get all/most of these guys? Save Golson, they're all late-first to mid-second round guys."
Saints,34b93c,aimerj,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:30:38 2015 UTC,13- Owa Odighizuwa 31- Devin Smith 44- Rowe/Marpet/Anthony - 1 of the 3 75- Golson - If one of the previous 3 are still there then take one of them and wait till 78 for Golson  Owa fits Ryans defense as a SOLB that can also play Strong Side DE in 4-3 looks. He has the length Ryan likes in defenders and great power/size/speed combination.   Devin Smith I think fits what Payton wants to do on offense. Establish a credible run game to open up the big pass plays. Smith from what I have seen is great at tracking the ball and making adjustments. Cant expect deep passes to be perfect.  Rowe I am not personally in love with but I know Ryan likes defenders with size/length. Ryan also likes versatile defenders and Rowe has a lot of experience at FS. Confusing the offense as to what defenders are going to do helps cause turnovers.  Marpet I believe they will target because he is a good fit for zone blocking scheme and could play LG or Center. We have taken chances on small school players before and been rewarded big time so we go back to that well one more time. I have a hard time seeing Lelito as the starting LG to start the year. Evans played hurt last year and Unger has missed quite a few games the last 2 years so we need to have a good backup. Lelito played pretty well at center so I would be comfortable with him backing up guard and center.  Anthony isnt my favorite ILB prospect but he has ideal size and good speed. Hawthorne isnt that big for ILB so I think they will want to add some size to the position rather than taking another undersized ILB like Kendricks or Dawson.  Golson doesnt fit what Rob wants in a defender that well but I think we need a slot corner and Golson is a good competitor and has shown a knack for causing turnovers. I could also see Steven Nelson as well because of how great of a tackler he is. Defenses can go a long way just by not letting the ball carrier get extra yards from broken tackles.
Saints,34b93c,aimerj,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"My prediction is that if we get Vic Beasley, Danny Shelton, Dante Fowler, or Leonard Williams with the first pick (a trade may be necessary), we will win the division and make the playoffs (barring a major injury to a key player).

Stay where we are: Danny Shelton or Eric Kendricks.  I'm torn on what to do. I want guys that can contribute for our team, but I don't want just one guy contributing. I want to keep our two first round picks, and trade up only from 31. I think we're in a really weird spot in a really weird draft where we won't get a normal top 15 pick if we stay. Look at last year, Aaron Donald at 13, and OBJ at 12. Mosely at 17. Not that there wont be those type of guys, but I'm just not feeling it from any like last year. I think trading back is a great idea to get a bunch of guys that can help now and later. Maybe even trade for a 3rd 1st round pick with a 2nd and 3rd round pick."

Sure it could happen since we saw 2012-2013, but we have a long way to go before we even consider a jump like that.  That being said, I am cautiously optimistic."
Saints,3490ee,Hotdog_Skin,4,Wed Apr 29 07:32:14 2015 UTC,Hahaha Keenan Lewis posted a pic with the CBs and Safeties and it said Sea of Shadows. I think he's trying to get our defense a name like the LOB. I thought I'd help try and get the name out there (even though it's corny as fuck).

The backfield is an ocean, and our secondary is the shadows? Are shadows good at defense?   My best guess is he means they cover receivers so well, it's like they're the shadows of the recievers. But shadows don't stop recievers. They just trail the player.. All the way into the end zone.  I love Keenan. ALOT. But that name is stupid as hell. I hope it doesn't catch on."
Saints,3490ee,Hotdog_Skin,3,Wed Apr 29 18:22:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're trying to get at a sort of 'Bermuda Triangle' thing, where WR's disappear from the games with no apparent explanation?

Saints,3490ee,flordeliest,3,Wed Apr 29 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"I think the addition of browner and a healthy Byrd will get us in the top half of the league. I think we will be between 10-15, especially if we get a great pass rusher in this draft. Byrd was the second best safety in the league in Buffalo, and if he can just be a top 10 I think it will be a tremendous boost for our defense."
Saints,3490ee,pottersquash,2,Wed Apr 29 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm not as down on our defensive talent as others. I think that with a decent draft, we still have the potential to be great.  That being said, what I'm worried about the most is what Rob Ryan will do. Even with everyone healthy at the start of last season, we looked abysmal. We ran some weird stuff and lost all momentum from the season before."

Saints,3490ee,brokenearth02,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"I think if they get guys who are mentally capable of understanding Rob Ryan's scheme we should be top 15. People forget that we do have the stars for our pass rush and got a potential wildcard with Anthony Spencer. Galette is an elite pass rusher. We just need a better supporting staff for him and Jordan. My biggest worry is NT and ILB. We need a rangy, mental ILB who can play every down and be our defensive QB and I think we need to take whatever steps are necessary to lock down Eric Kendricks.   I've said it before - if our starting secondary all plays like they did individually in 2013 we will have one of the best secondaries in the league. The players have done it, Ryan just needs to make sure the scheme is locked down.   I think our best way of maximizing the talent on our roster is by playing a lot of ""big nickel"" with kenny in the box and bush and byrd deep."
Saints,3490ee,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:23:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, NT and ILB are our biggest concern, last eyar we had no interior rush whatesoever. I still want Dupree at 13 tho.

Saints,348i39,SoUnderrated,5,Wed Apr 29 03:22:05 2015 UTC,I think people are underestimating our O-line. Tackles are both really good and we have two all pros at RG and C although Evans is getting older. Can't imagine we can't find good depth in a later round
Saints,348i39,dean815,0,Wed Apr 29 04:48:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is underestimating our O-line (here anyways; /r/nfl is a different story), but considering two realities:     I think the jury is still out on whether Lelito can play Guard at a high enough level to be a consistent starter for us; particularly with the front office's comments regarding the interior line this offseason.  The talented Tackle/Guard/Center prospects would come in and compete for that spot with Lelito. Tl;dr - Scherff/Peat/Fisher could start at LG this season  Jahri Evans, Max Unger, and Zach Strief are all getting old, and we can't assume we'll find replacements for them all in one draft.  Taking a talented prospect now will give Lelito more time to develop, and set up a plan of succession for one/more of them to leave.  It also gives us more flexibility in future drafts, so we don't feel like we have to reach for an OL prospect because our line has become barren. Tl;dr - Scherff/Peat/Fisher would help Saints prepare for Unger, Strief, Evans' retirements.     I am extremely high on Scherff and Fisher, would love to see us take Scherff at 13, or Fisher at 31 or 44."
Saints,348i39,AGQ-,3,Wed Apr 29 16:45:19 2015 UTC,If we have to sit players it would be waaaay wiser to select starters in the eairly rounds and use the fifth and sixth round picks on their replacements. Outside of Cooks we got maybe 20 snaps out of last years draft class. If this team is to improve we are to get contributors.
Saints,348i39,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"Do you think Tim Lelito would beat Brandon Scherff in training camp? I'm no scout, but from watching game tape on Scherff I think he would win a starting role easily.    Who are the players we could take to contribute immediately? Williams/Shelton would likely beat Jenkins/Bunkley/Virgil. Several ILB prospects could push Hawthorne/Ellerbe for a starting role and likely win.  Peters could likely beat Breaux/Dixon/Frederick/Wilson/SJB for nickel corner. Cooper would be an incredible WR3.  And Fowler/Gregory/Thompson could likely edge out Haralson as a run defender opposite Galette.    And I'd love to have any of them! I just happen to think Scherff is a far better OG than some of those other players at their positions."
Saints,348i39,AGQ-,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:31:00 2015 UTC,"Do you think Tim Lelito would beat Brandon Scherff in training camp?   Yes. You are drastically underestimating the difference between NFL and college. Schreff has faced three maybe two NFL worthy players, maybe one will eventually start in the NFL. The best college lineman are routinely bullied when they first get to the league.  We want an ILB because Ellerbe and Hawthorne are terrible in coverage and both are about to be 30 yrs old, not to mention they are injury prone and the only back up is Humbar, who is god awful.  No I don't think Peters is beating out our corners. Peters has played against only Jalen Strong? Maybe one or two WR he faced was even prepared for press coverage. Outside of Mariota not many talented QBs either. The NFL is a completely different level than college. He will most definitely isn't beating behind Browner and Lewis who we have for three ore years, and probably Dixon and Breaux either. Dixon played pretty well last year for a rookie UDFA and was petty much our #2 corner by the end of last year. I don't think his press is better than Breaux's, the CFL is far more physical and difficult then the NFL at times. Breaux has two years of literally the CFL's top corner. SJB has sat out a year and will likely command snaps, too. Peters isn't quick enough to play the slot. Compared to the other parts of the defense our secondary has plenty of depth.  I do think Darby can beat out Frederick and Wilson for the slot corner position, but Peters sits. Even though we run three safety sets in most cases.  Cooper is already at the NFL level but I consider our offense top ten as it is. He doesn't net us anymore wins next year. Bees could make any fifth rounder with good hands into a 900 yard receiver. Stefon Diggs or Ty Montgomery types in the fifth please.  Our front seven needs more work than any other positions.We are thin at nearly every position.  Thompson is an ILB not an OLB."

Saints,348i39,aimerj,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:27:28 2015 UTC,That was a huge reach and Dallas literally had no one for him to compete with. Martin is an anomaly.
Saints,348i39,flordeliest,0,Thu Apr 30 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"That's because we are a veteran team. There wasn't any positions open for rookies, at least early."
Saints,348i39,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:00:51 2015 UTC,"Strief is 31, Unger is 29. I'd expect to get at least 3 more years out of both. I think right now we are focused on the last part of the Brees era and I think the only one we will need to replace barring significant injury before then is Evans. Meanwhile we can get some late round picks in a position that isn't a pressing day 1 need."
Saints,348i39,dean815,3,Wed Apr 29 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"Not a no-brainer, but it would be a good situation for us. It all depends on who else is there. Personally, I'd take Dupree over Scherff if he's there, but we're in a spot where if we don't end up trading up, we really just have to wait and see what happens."
Saints,348i39,sfzen,2,Wed Apr 29 05:44:42 2015 UTC,"I'm all about drafting the best player available (within reason), but I think that looking to the later rounds of the draft it seems more likely that the BPA will be o-lineman. There are quite a few mid to late round options that would at least fit with the team as competition for Lelito. The same can't really be said for our other positions of need, so I would say take defense with the first pick."
Saints,348i39,whodat951,5,Wed Apr 29 06:05:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a no brainer, but I'd be so happy if Scherff falls to 13. I think he's as close to a sure thing in this draft."

The no brainier is to pass because we can find better value in the later rounds of day two. Guards are not high difficult to find. We need contributors not payers to sit behind a starter."
Saints,348i39,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:01:03 2015 UTC,Yeah but we have two solid starting tackles. The only pressing concern on our OL is LG.
Saints,348i39,dean815,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:23:51 2015 UTC,"Which Lelito will fill in for. He'll be fine at G he just sucked at C. I personally do not believe OL is a concern anymore, but we could take some in the mid rounds."
Saints,348i39,makeplayz,0,Wed Apr 29 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"We can get a starter at guard much later in the draft. There is no reason to take one of the top rated tackle at 13 only to insert them into the interior or sit them. We can go on an on about value but according to value we don't make the selection. Value is to take a day one starter on our terrible defense.  Also why are you guys so confident Payton would start a rookie on the line anyway? In the unlikely scenario we make the pick, they wont see the field until after Lelito and Kelemete play terribly in several games before they even get a shot."
Saints,348i39,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:33:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I just also don't think we should address tackle at all in the draft. I think our need for pass rush is overrated. I think our biggest areas of focus should be ILB and interior DL."

Saints,347pl3,SoUnderrated,3,Tue Apr 28 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"I would rather use 44 and 78 to trade up. According to trade value charts that should get us up to 26-29. If Kendricks or Malcolm Brown make it there, do it. Use 31 on Shane Ray or Randy Gregory. One will be there."
Saints,347pl3,evtine,3,Tue Apr 28 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, this. Or trading back if the player isn't there"
Saints,347pl3,jffm114,2,Wed Apr 29 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"Kendricks at 13, Gregory/Ray at 31, and trade up for Malcolm Brown/Eddie Goldman/ that Phillips guys (his name slips me rn) whoever fits best at DT. That would be quite an exciting day one draft."
Saints,347pl3,VegasSaint9,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:34:09 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, I'm with it.   And Jordan Phillips. I'd definitely take him or Goldman if Brown is off the board. But I'm one of the believers in John Jenkins so I think we can afford wait on DT. Go with a DE like Preston Smith or a WR like Algholor or Perriman."
Saints,347pl3,evtine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:30:46 2015 UTC,"There are  a ton of impact players in the 31 area Malcolm Brown, Shaq Thompson,Eddie Goldman, Owamagbe Odigihuzuwa, Eric Kendricks, Jordan Philips, ELI Harold, Preston Smith, Carl Davis, Arik Armstead, Stephone Anthony.  They odds of someone in the top 20 falling are really high. We have far better selection if we move from 44 to the early first round area."
Saints,347pl3,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:45:19 2015 UTC,"Man, I do love Kendricks but some of the next tier guys seem like they'll be great too. Going to have to determine the value drop off at each position before each pick."
Saints,347pl3,dean815,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:43:42 2015 UTC,"That's my thinking. Kendricks is definitely the best overall ILB prospect, but I just don't see a big enough drop off from him to the handful of guys that will go in the 2nd to warrant taking Kendricks at 13."
Saints,347pl3,sfzen,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:43:18 2015 UTC,"ILB typically isn't drafted high, especially undersized ILB. Hypotheticaly if Kendricks is there in the mid 20's I would love to move up to get him."

Saints,347pl3,Lokipokie504,0,Wed Apr 29 00:21:06 2015 UTC,"No one of any importance has said anything.   Not sure who, but he's by far the consensus best MLB, and I think there will be a number of teams position themselves ahead of the 49ers to draft him."
Saints,347pl3,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 29 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I've seen other MLB's rated higher than him, so I didn't think he was the consensus #1 (although he is IMO). I was just curious why you were saying that. I don't disagree with you or pretend to think I know what will happen, I just hadn't heard that yet."
Saints,347pl3,Lokipokie504,0,Wed Apr 29 01:00:12 2015 UTC,"The best mock draft get what, 50% of the picks right? And most of the drafts I see would pretty much break down if something surprising happens, like a Heyward-Bey, Tebow, Ted Ginn, Locker, EJ Manuel, or Ponder. And that's just recent picks that no one saw coming. All it will take is 1 team to give Kendrick a Top 10 grade and he becomes a Top 10 pick. It's not that there are several teams in the Top 10 who could benefit from Kendricks, and we don't know any team's grade of players."
Saints,347pl3,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 29 01:13:32 2015 UTC,"You're completely right. I just haven't heard even a whisper of that. I wouldn't mind Kendricks at 13 if all the good pass rushers are off the board (over Dupree, who I don't like), but I didn't think anyone else liked that idea."
Saints,347pl3,Lokipokie504,0,Wed Apr 29 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"I see Kendricks, Landon Collins, Waynes, Schreff and Shelton shaping the draft. Any number of teams could have fell in love with them and screw everyone's projections."

Saints,346mz7,flordeliest,4,Thu Apr 30 00:03:41 2015 UTC,I really wish people would stop mocking wide receivers to us at 31. Not sure how we'd be going all in on defense with the sixth or seventh best receiver in the draft.
Saints,346mz7,whodat951,2,Tue Apr 28 19:26:56 2015 UTC,I could definitely see us grabbing a wide receiver at the 31 spot if there arent any great defensive players available at that time. I also happen to love aghular and would love that pick at 31.
Saints,346mz7,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Apr 28 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"That's fair, but with inside linebackers falling off the board in the picks before us, it would be wise to grab one there and then take a receiver later. Chris Conley would be a good fit, and could be available in the third."

Saints,346mz7,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:20:34 2015 UTC,A WR could be the best player available at that slot though.  I'm also hearing Mike Mayock saying Saints could reach for Petty at 31 which sounds crazy to me.  Maybe in the 3rd but 31st overall is rough.

First things first people need to understand that we use a four man front in obvious pass situations. DEs are Gallete and Jordan, DTs are Hicks and Bunk/Jenkins.  Our base defense and run situation defense is the 3-4 with Jordan and Hicks at DE, Galette at Jack OLB, Haralson at Sam and Bunk/Jenkins at NT.  The most important thing to remember is that our run defense was much worse than our passing defense. We gave up 4.8 yards per rushing attempt last year (31st in the league) and that extra pass rush isn't going to fix the defense. We had the same line up as in 2013 that ranked fourth in sacks, so the pass rush isn't the problem.  The biggest difference from 2013 is an obvious regression in Bunk, Haralson, and to a lesser extent Hicks.  Bunkley no longer got Hicks one on ones on passing downs and was routinely uprooted on run plays. Jenkins is OKish but we need to replace Bunk and just plain get a stronger rotation at NT and DT.  Haralson let offenses rush outside on his side routinely. We need someone to play run support OLB not another rush specialist OLB.  This means that pure pass rushers like Beasley and Ray are not immediately useful to us. They are exceptional rushers but they lack the size to play DE and would be redundant in the 3-4 because of Galette, who already plays the weakside.  If we trade up it will be for Fowler or Dupree who fit what we need in an OLB. Someone who can eat up blocks and set the edge against 300+ lbs tackles and generally help against the run on the strongside. Though they are not as developed a rusher as Ray and Beasley, they can cover better and have the size to move to DE and can contribute immediately at the Sam while they develop their technique."
Saints,344g3v,flordeliest,0,Tue Apr 28 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"This is why you can't look at raw numbers. Statistically speaking, the rushing defense looks works than the passing numbers, but watching the game, it's obvious that the problem was the secondary and pass rush. The rushing looks so bad because we were behind so often. Hell, the second half of the Cowboys alone set the running game back a few hundred yards. I think Romo attempted like 6 passes the entire second half."
Saints,344g3v,Saints2Death,6,Tue Apr 28 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"??? If we could have adequately stopped the run then coming from behind is way more feasible. Our defense performed well when the opponents had to pass. Most of the time it was our offense trying to keep up resulting in Brees throwing picks.   Besides the 190 yrds during the Dallas game we also got ran all over by the Bengals(186), Ravens(243), Browns(122), 49ers(144), Atlanta wk1(123) and Panthers wk14(271).  Our passing defense wasn't good because of our LBs and CBs, not named Lewis, constantly blowing coverages in both base and passing packages.  The bottom line is the passing defense does not matter if we can not stop the run."
Saints,344g3v,flordeliest,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:37:22 2015 UTC,"When you're behind in the second half, there will be an increase in rushing attempts which means means an increase in stats. I'm not saying our rushing defense is good, I'm just saying that our pass defense is worse than rush defense despite that our rush defense was ranked lower. We gave up a bunch of those yards in the second half because teams were running out the lead. Teams didn't need to pass on us in the second half. Romo or Cam could have easily threw for another 150 yards and a couple TDs if they continued on the pace they were throwing in the first half in the second."
Saints,344g3v,Saints2Death,2,Tue Apr 28 18:02:25 2015 UTC,"Even if the game is close or we are up teams will still run the ball down our throat. This makes keeping a lead extremely difficult, because they will essentially control the clock as time whines down.  Maybe Romo but not Cam.  The Cowboy's line stonewalled us but if we could have slowed down their rushing game we would have at least had an opportunity  to comeback. Suddenly there is far more time on the clock for us, even if they are consistently scoring through the air.  Definitely not Cam his line was awful and we still gave up 200+ rushing yards. They ran no huddle and literally just targeted, Lofton, Humbar and Robinson on short throws. Don't you dare suggest they beat us through the air, when they hardly completed any intermediate pass. We consistently flushed Cam from the pocket only to have someone blow a coverage or he would just outrun our LBs for easy yards. Two of their TDs were short passes to RBs that turned into big plays and one Cam ran in himself for like sixty yards that  triggered that huge fight. I still think that game is way different had Armstead not gotten hurt. Defensively we only had Lofton and Humbar at ILB, but we could have kept up scoring wise. And Cam isn't that good when you force him to make reads and rely on his arm."
Saints,344g3v,flordeliest,3,Tue Apr 28 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with not taking a pass rusher early in this draft. I've really sold myself on them taking Shelton at 13 (if he's there) which would be a huge help for the defense as he would be a huge asset in stopping the run, and eat up blocks and collapse the pocket as a NT against the passing game. Then I wouldn't mind them taking two ILBs at 31 & 44 (I expect most of the top ILBs to go in the late 1st or early 2nd) to shore up the defense up the middle, and taking Kendricks/Thompson at 31 and one of Anthony/Perryman/McKinney/Dawson at 44 (or Kendricks/Thompson if they're still available) would be huge for the defense. Also wouldn't mind them taking a top CB like Marcus Peters if he drops to 31 due to character concerns, but that's less likely to happen. Either way, as long as they improve the D with this draft, I don't think taking a pass rusher early is necessary. Getting guys who can help stop the run is still a big priority, and these players can still help in the passing game in coverage or by freeing up other players. Shelton specifically I think would be huge for the production of Galette, Jordan and Hicks as he'd help collapse the pocket and help free up other players so they could get pressure on the QB. As long as they address the D, I don't think they need to force a pass rusher. I'd rather them take players at other positions than reach for a pass rusher who may not even work out (a lot of pass rushers are ""boom or bust"" guys, which is why I'm hesitant to take any of the pass rushers who would be available at 13 since most of the better pass rushers will be off the board by then, and the ones left will have big question marks). I just hope the Saints have a solid draft and not force any picks that don't make sense."
Saints,344g3v,Hedgery,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:01:40 2015 UTC,"I would be perfectly fine with Shelton at 13, or Collins.  If I allow myself to dream, then Beasley would be there at 13, but I know that isn't going to happen.  I wouldn't mind Kendricks at 31, but doubt he would be there."
Saints,344g3v,Random452,3,Tue Apr 28 17:20:05 2015 UTC,"I think people are over-thinking our need for an edge rusher. Galette is one of the best in the league, and hopefully Cam Jordan can get back to his 2013 form next year. It just seems like after Fowler there's a little hesitation with all of the other guys in that group. I think we need to find someone who can push the pocket from the inside and shut down the run game, whether it's Shelton at 13 or Malcom Brown at 31 or elsewhere I think we need a guy to add some explosiveness to our interior. We also need to make ILB a priority. There's a big pocket of guys that I thought would end up right around our 2nd round pick but a lot of them are shooting up the board. If Eric Kendricks is on the board at 31 I think we have to take him. I think there's a place in our defense for both Kendricks and a guy like Stephone Anthony or Bernardrick McKinney as the latter two have the size and versatility to play SLB and set the edge if need be."
Saints,344g3v,dean815,3,Tue Apr 28 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"You guys know that probably about 10% of the prospects that smoke weed actually get busted, right? It's well publicized that many NFL players smoke weed in the offseason. One example:  http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8292ebd3/article/brown-at-least-50-percent-of-nfl-players-smoke-pot  I know it's a ""red flag"" because getting caught smoking weed while preparing for the NFL is indicative of carelessness, but can you safely say that Vic Beasley, Dante Fowler, etc. doesn't ever smoke weed just because there wasn't a news report? My point is just this: we can't just totally write off talented players, because these guys can still get their acts together. We have to rely on the interview process by our coaches and front office to determine whether or not a guy will do what's expected of him once he signs on the dotted line. We need talented players who take their NFL careers totally seriously, but nobody is a saint (no pun intended)."
Saints,344g3v,Charizard_Targaryen,4,Tue Apr 28 07:53:37 2015 UTC,The weed incident doesn't concern me about Ray... the injury does. No way I'm taking him at 13 knowing he's going to miss all off-season.

Saints,344g3v,dean815,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:58:15 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I also see the value of trusting your player evaluations and going after the guy you really want or need.  It's starting to look like Williams, who is talented enough to be the #1 overall, could fall as low as 5th overall.   To me it would be insane not to at least consider trading to get a player of his caliber if he does indeed fall that far."
Saints,344g3v,sfzen,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I think there are plenty of scenarios where it makes sense, but I think this year we need to try to get ourselves some depth and a few more darts to throw at the board. Consider also that the position best suited for Leonard Williams in our defense is already occupied by Cam Jordan, who is a hell of a player himself. I think we need to find a rangy SLB, run stopping nose tackle, shutdown corner to develop under browner/lewis and play nickel, or a big receiver with that first pick based on the talent available. If these ILBs keep shooting up the board we may even want to jump on one there or trade down a few spots (help Philly, Cleveland, KC, etc get a receiver) because I think it's our greatest need. Even if he's better than Cam Jordan, we're looking for the guy who offers the most potential over the guy they replace.   I think a nose tackle makes the most sense here."
Saints,344g3v,neovenator250,0,Tue Apr 28 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"The weed thing isn't nearly as big a deal as you're making it out to be. Everyone smokes weed. Ray was just unlucky enough to get caught. Like the Cardinals GM said a while back, ""if Hannibal Lecter ran a 4.3, we'd diagnose him with an eating disorder."" I'm not worried about Ray aside from his injury.  The reason it was such a big deal with Gregory was that he was a fucking idiot. He knew, months in advance, that he would be drug tested at the combine, and he knew exactly fucking when it would happen. And he still couldn't quit for a month, when he knew it could potentially cost him millions. Weed typically won't show up in a test after a month, tops. Gregory claimed he stopped smoking in December, and flat out lied to all of the GM's and coaches.  Ray was responsible enough to pass the test. I could give a fuck if he smokes weed or not, as long it doesn't affect his ability to play football. He got a citation for possession. That's nothing."
Saints,344g3v,sophandros,1 point,Tue Apr 28 08:41:30 2015 UTC,Shane Ray also has injury concerns and crappy workout numbers that are dropping his stock.  It's not JUST that he was dumb enough to get caught with weed right before the draft.
Saints,344g3v,Bouzal,0,Tue Apr 28 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"Ray got caught in possession of weed. As you noted, he did not fail a test. A decent lawyer will get that possession charge dropped."

I don't care if you smoke, but don't be moronic enough to have it on you and drive terribly and get yourself arrested 3 fucking days before the draft. It shows terrible judgement"
Saints,344g3v,Bouzal,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:46:48 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons weed could have been in his car without his knowledge or without him smoking weed. All of those still point to poor judgment, as they involve associating with those sorts of people.  The fact that he got pulled over for speeding is being overblown. Young men drive fast. He was not under the influence, and as I said in an earlier post, any decent lawyer will get the weed charge dropped.  So what it comes down to is this:  Is he smoking weed or is he hanging out with others who smoke weed? Both show poor judgment, and both merit further scrutiny. But the way this kid is being crucified in the media this morning is pathetic."
Saints,344g3v,sophandros,0,Tue Apr 28 14:27:00 2015 UTC,It's just the fact that he got caught this close to the draft. It's like he shows no regard for the fact that he could be a top 10 pick and that's terrifying to teams

Saints,343kvd,Mudkipz137,4,Tue Apr 28 03:01:35 2015 UTC,"He'll probably go in the 3rd-5th. Most people have their QB's ranked Winston > Mariota > Hundley > Grayson/Petty > Everyone else.  He's 5th round talent, but he'll go a bit earlier since the QB class is weak. If he's there in the 5th, I'd be happy to get him. I wouldn't take him in the 3rd, though."
Saints,343kvd,sfzen,3,Tue Apr 28 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think he's supposed to go anywhere between rounds 2-4. FWIW, depending on who you ask he's the next best QB in the draft after Winston and Mariota."
Saints,343kvd,overratedfood,4,Tue Apr 28 03:14:03 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people on here are very averse to us taking a quarterback, and Im the biggest Brees supporter you'll ever meet, but if Payton is confident enough in a quarterback like Grayson, who I think would be a great pick if we had to take a QB, then I think that means he and Drew have had discussions about Drew's window of opportunity."
Saints,343kvd,Bouzal,8,Tue Apr 28 03:43:29 2015 UTC,Payton knows exactly what he's doing as far as future QB's go. I'm sure he and Brees have and will continue to discuss Brees' plans for how long he intends to play.
Saints,343kvd,sfzen,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:03:03 2015 UTC,That's something that I think a lot of Saints fans don't get. I'm sure Brees is very vocal with Sean with his plans and vice versa. It's not like they hate each other. And neither of them want the team to go to shit after Brees takes off his pads for the last time.  They're preparing for the inevitable that is Brees retirement. And they prepare for it as they see fit. We have nothing to worry about as long as Drew is willing to train a new QB. The rest of the offense and defense is what we need to pay attention to.

Saints,342qoq,sfzen,3,Mon Apr 27 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"I really hope we don't package our two firsts. The only way I'd like that is if we traded into the top 5 and got Fowler or Cooper. I really like our 31st pick as an opportunity to snag kendricks, McKinney, or another great ILB.   I know we'll get a great guard in the later rounds because the saints rock at that.   I know a lot of people on this sub really don't want the saints to go offense in the first round, but if we got Amari, then we would have amazing receivers for the next 5-10 years. Not to mention that he runs better routes than a lot of NFL receivers. If you are where you're supposed to be, Brees will get you the ball."
Saints,342qoq,Bigheadparker,4,Mon Apr 27 23:03:05 2015 UTC,Shelton please. We need a run stuffer. There will be plenty of DEs at 31
Saints,342qoq,SoUnderrated,2,Tue Apr 28 00:32:59 2015 UTC,"I think we have a real shot for Gregory at 13, but my prediction is we trade up to grab Beasley/Fowler depending on how the Top 5 plays out."
Saints,342qoq,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 27 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely a possibility. I think if we trade up, we're going for Beasley over Fowler. Beasley is Rob Ryan's type of guy."
Saints,342qoq,sfzen,6,Mon Apr 27 22:52:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't want to trade up because I can't see Fowler/Beasley being worth what it would take to trade up compared to the value of Gregory/Dupree at 13. It's just that we have a ton of picks, a GM/Coach who aren't scared to trade up and a new ""college scout"" who is looking to make a splash."
Saints,342qoq,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 27 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Though 13 is kind of a sketchy spot for us. Usually, it's a great spot to be picking. This year, there just aren't nearly as many elite prospects as there usually are. There are really only ~20 guys I would give a 1st round grade at all, let alone a top 15 value. It's entirely possible that Gregory and Dupree will be gone at 13, so if we want a top pass rusher, we might have to trade up."
Saints,342qoq,sfzen,5,Mon Apr 27 23:06:31 2015 UTC,I think this draft is going to surprise a lot of people who value mocks. I don't think the Top 10 is going to look anywhere near what people think it's going to look like.
Saints,342qoq,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 27 23:12:56 2015 UTC,It's definitely going to be an interesting one. I think we'll see more trades in the 1st than we've seen in a long time.
Saints,342qoq,sfzen,2,Mon Apr 27 23:17:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I'm talking actual personnel. There's like 12 guys that are pretty much interchangeable in the Top 10 in every mock draft. I think the Top 10 is going to be drastically different."

Beasley and White are the two that I think have a slight chance of dropping to us, but not likely.  Worst case scenario: Winston, Mariota, Williams, Fowler, Beasley, Cooper, White, Scherff, Dupree, Shelton, Ray, Gregory are the guys off the board when we pick. That would leave us with Collins, Waynes, and Parker from my list. Maybe add Malcom Brown in there, as well; he's growing on me. In that scenario, I'd (reluctantly) go with Parker.   In a perfect world, Beasley falls to us. Ideally but realistically, Dupree."
Saints,342qoq,sfzen,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"I'd love that perfect world theory. I'm a fan of Beasley, especially given that I grew up in SC and am a Clemson fan."

Saints,342qoq,sfzen,3,Mon Apr 27 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"I mean, as long as he's not as big a Falcons fan as Westbank is a Saints fan, I think we're okay xD"
Saints,342qoq,GreenVisorOfJustice,2,Tue Apr 28 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"I've really sold myself on the idea of picking Danny Shelton if he's there at 13. He'd be a huge addition to our defense, as he would be an ideal NT for our 3-4 defense and immediately make a huge impact in helping to stuff the run, as well as he could help the pass rush by collapsing the pocket and taking on double teams which could free up other pass rushers and allow them to get pressure on the QB. Especially him lining up next to Hicks on the DL would be huge because both are great at pushing their guys back and they would help free up Jordan, Galette, Spence, Edebali, etc. and allow them to get greater pressure on the QB."
Saints,342qoq,Hedgery,4,Mon Apr 27 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"Hicks already demands double teams (part of his decline in production last year).  So, I agree.  Shelton would be a great pick up.  He's my pick at #13."
Saints,342qoq,smokeajay,2,Mon Apr 27 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so having him and Shelton would either require teams to double them both, or then it would allow them to bull rush through a single offensive lineman. Think picking Shelton could really help Hicks's and Jordan's production."
Saints,342qoq,Hedgery,2,Tue Apr 28 00:57:13 2015 UTC,Shelton is one of the few players I'm in favor of trading up for. We have been lacking a solid NT for years now. I think it's our biggest missing piece
Saints,342qoq,KarmaPoIice,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"Trade out of 13. Not sure about if I'd rather go up or down, but I don't feel like we'll get a player we want here without it being a reach."

Shelton and Scherff are easy picks Fowler, Beasily, Dupree and Gregory are all pretty instant picks as well Parker and Waynes wouldn't surprise me either  It really depends on how the other 12 picks go prior to our pick and if there is someone really wanting to trade into the spot."

Saints,342qoq,evtine,2,Tue Apr 28 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think they both will be. But Gregory especially. If we pass on both guys at both picks in the first, we better take one of them at 44. They're too good."

Saints,33z79j,harveyfjord,7,Mon Apr 27 00:44:33 2015 UTC,"O.o. Was a bit of a reach at that spot. We need a pass rusher, and his knock is that he's not that great of a pass rusher. I do love Shelton and Anthony though, so it was pretty good. I love petty and to get him that late was a steal. Hardy would fit our offense perfectly so that was also a great pick. Idt Nelson is great for us as he's more of a zone guy. I give it a B."
Saints,33z79j,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 27 00:59:31 2015 UTC,Who do you think is better at pass rushing than Owa? I'm having a hard time comparing him with Eli Harold and Preston Smith
Saints,33z79j,SoUnderrated,4,Mon Apr 27 03:45:23 2015 UTC,"Owa is more of a 4-3 DE. He could probably play 3-4 OLB, but he could actually bulk up and play 3-4 DE, I think. Preston Smith is the same type of prospect, though I don't see him playing 3-4 OLB. Eli Harold would be a standard 3-4 OLB. As far as pass rushing talent, I'd give the edge to Harold. Owa is better defending the run (though competent rushing the passer), and I basically see Smith as a less versatile version of Owa."
Saints,33z79j,sfzen,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:34:55 2015 UTC,Good analysis. I'd have to look into them more
Saints,33z79j,SoUnderrated,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:52:01 2015 UTC,"Pretty much exactly what u/sfzen said. I'm on mobile, so it's hard to see exactly how the round went and who was left. All 3 are pretty good prospects, but Idt any of them really fit what we need. I would've probably traded that pick or maybe get a wr. I probably would've went with Harold out of the 3 though. He has the skill and moves, but he needs to bulk up and get stronger. That's usually pretty easy with an NFL type diet and workout schedule."
Saints,33z79j,Lokipokie504,4,Mon Apr 27 12:50:08 2015 UTC,"I can get behind the first three picks, but that's it. Hardy is not the type of receiver we need. Kouandjio is terrible and Petty is a useless pick since we don't need a back up QB. Don't know enough about the other three picks."
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 27 01:38:32 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean about Kouandijo, but I think he has an overly bad rap because of that negative NFL.com blurb on him.  He's ranked higher on a number of other boards and his performance on tape shows that he has the capacity to be a solid run blocker if given some time to develop."
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:05:55 2015 UTC,"I think his bad rap is warranted honestly. Project players don't come out of Alabama. Nick Saban has the best coaching staff in all of college. If a player outside of QB isn't a polished project coming out of one of the major programs, then that should be a major red flag."
Saints,33z79j,SoUnderrated,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"First of all explain how Hardy isn't the type of receiver we need. He could easily replace Stills. I wanted Funchess but Hardy could be an instant start for us. Secondly, please provide me with your expert draft analysis on how Kouandijo is terrible. Finally, the Petty pick wasn't useless since he was a steal and Drew could groom him into being a great successor"
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:02:05 2015 UTC,"Hardy is 5'10 and we have 5 receivers on the roster around 6 foot or shorter. Hardy doesn't bring an immediate improvement over these guys as a rookie. If he did, he wouldn't be available in the third round.  If Koundjio didn't play for Alabama, he'd probably be a third day pick. He was the a weak link on Alabama's line, mostly because of bad technique. Since Alabama has one of the best coaching staffs in college football, this shouldn't be the case.   And you're insane if you'd be happy with Petty being Brees replacement. When exactly do you think Brees is going to retire? His contract ends in 2016, which doesn't mean he's going to retire then. Are you saying we should let the greatest player in franchise history walk because of Bryce Petty. If Petty was really that great, why didn't some take him in the first?"
Saints,33z79j,DoctorWhosOnFirst,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:19:11 2015 UTC,"You are 100% wrong on Kouandjio. I have no idea how you think that he was the weakest link. That was the RG. Since you're such an expert, can you please tell me who that was without looking it up?   Kouandjio helped anchor the left side of Bama's line. He's a mauler in the run game and okay in the pass game. Bama runs ZBS, just like the Saints now do.   I don't mind people disagreeing with the picks, but your analysis of Bama's offensive line is just ignorant.   Edit: if you have other complaints on Arie, that's fine. He's by no means a perfect prospect.   But when your objection is based on something that is completely and utterly wrong, it's frustrating."
Saints,33z79j,brandonie187,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:14:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I cant see how anyone can say Kouandjio is the weakest link after watching Leon Brown play. There's a reason Kouandjio is projected to be drafted and Brown isn't.
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,-5,Mon Apr 27 15:33:24 2015 UTC,"how exactly am I 100% wrong. You disagree with me, but it doesn't mean I'm wrong. It just means you don't agree with me."
Saints,33z79j,DoctorWhosOnFirst,4,Mon Apr 27 03:24:12 2015 UTC,"How was he the weak link on Bama's o-line? You made the assertion. Back it up then.  You didn't answer my question either. Can you name who the right guard was without looking him up?  Have you watched every Alabama game over the past two seasons (which is how long Arie has been a starter)? Have you rewatched multiple Bama games from the past two seasons?  Kouandjio certainly wasn't the best on the line, saying he was the weak link (and I assume you meant this year) is just crazy.   Edit: Again, I'm not saying it's ridiculous to have problems with Kouandjio. However, saying he was the weak link on Bama's o-line just isn't correct; and it makes me question your criticisms."
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,-6,Mon Apr 27 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not wasting time on you, since you're too close to this mock draft being defensive to any criticism that you didn't draft perfectly.  I gave my opinion since the op asked for thoughts. You went straight to being a dick to me, so it's pointless to discuss this with you. If you want to hear people's opinions, don't be an asshole to them and say they are 100% wrong."
Saints,33z79j,DoctorWhosOnFirst,7,Mon Apr 27 03:36:37 2015 UTC,"Got it. You can't back up your criticism and don't want to admit you don't know what you're talking about when it comes to Bama's line.   I said multiple times, criticizing the pick is fine. He's not a perfect prospect. I'm not upset by your not liking Kouandjio.   I am upset because you're objecting to him based on something that's just inaccurate and not true. Kouandjio was absolutely not the weak link, as you claimed.   And you're damn right I'm gonna call you out on that. Because it is wrong."

Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,4,Mon Apr 27 03:38:55 2015 UTC,"Then what is Petty's purpose? We have at least two years left with Brees, which is half of Petty's rookie contract. Do you think we should let Brees walk after the 2016 season? Should we give Brees a new contract to take more of Petty's rookie contract away? What purpose does Petty play with the Saints.  And Kraft and the Patriots have zero barring on what the Saints do."
Saints,33z79j,SoUnderrated,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"Petty's purpose is to LEARN from one of the best in the league. I find it funny how you KNOW that Drew is gonna be around in 5 years as if you own a crystal ball. Drew must be just immune to aging and injuries.  And no Kraft doesn't but what i'm saying is it's stupid that you're calling me ""insane"" for having an opinion shared by many people and other teams often have done. Some people want to win later too"
Saints,33z79j,Saints2Death,3,Mon Apr 27 04:20:52 2015 UTC,Learn to do what exactly? What is he supposed to learn in 2+ seasons that someone we draft two years from now can't learn or doesn't know already.  Edit: And you really think the Saints will win later because they drafted a 5th round QB before their franchise QB retires?
Saints,33z79j,cajunrevenge,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:22:22 2015 UTC,"I love this draft. I am not as high as others  on Shelton but those first 3 picks is a significant improvement for our front 7. I think we might he an elite run defense with this draft, we certainly add a lot of size. Nelson is also a good tackling CB to boot. Owa's pass rush is underrated because he didn't put up gaudy sack totals but anyone who watches the  game tapes sees him constantly putting pressure on the qb. Disruption is production."
Saints,33z79j,DoctorWhosOnFirst,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:47:15 2015 UTC,"I was one of the GMs, and I'm really happy with how this turned out.  I think Owa can play Sam or DE depending on the situation.  He ran a 4.62 40 with a 1.61 10yd split, a 4.19 short shuttle, and a 7.36 3-cone drill.  The defense really improves with those first 3 picks.  Hardy should be able to contribute right away, and Kouandjio can compete with Lelito for LG.  That's where he played in college, and Bama runs a zone blocking scheme (like the Saints).  Petty was a value pick.  We knew we wanted a CB in the 5th, and several of our targets were there.  I'm not a huge fan of Petty, but I think he makes sense in the 5th.  He does have the tools; he just needs time to sit and learn how to run a pro-style offense and go through more than one read.  Nelson can go as high as the 3rd, so grabbing him in the 5th was a huge steal.  He can immediately compete for the nickel CB spot with a ceiling of becoming a CB2 eventually.  Koyack and Spaight were also value picks.  TE isn't necessarily a need, but Koyack has great size at 6'5, 255lbs and gives the Saints another young TE to groom.  Spaight is projected as high as the 4th round.  I think he's more naturally an OLB, but many think he has potential at ILB as well.  We were hoping to grab a back-up OT, but the value was never really there."
Saints,33z79j,sfzen,2,Mon Apr 27 01:07:56 2015 UTC,Owa ran a 4.62? That's a lot faster than I expected.
Saints,33z79j,DoctorWhosOnFirst,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that and then the SS and 3C make me think he can transition to Sam more easily. He tests well for speed and agility."
Saints,33zlf0,Saints2Death,28,Mon Apr 27 02:51:12 2015 UTC,"Brees plays until he is absolutely terrible.  IMO Payton Brees' relationship isn't like Brady and  Belichick. The second Belichick feels someone is better he is benching Brady.  I don't think Payton would do that. We should have fired Vitt a long time ago.  I don't think that sitting more than one year is good for QBs.  I don't expect Brees to mentor his eventual replacement.  I have very little confidence in new QB coach Mike Neu's ability to develop QB talent.  I don't expect we have a pleasant transition to the post Brees era.  Fully expect at least one year of none competitive football, spearheaded by terrible QB play(with or without Brees).  I expect our cap to be fucked as long as Brees is still on the books.  I have huge confidence in Payton's ability to find great QB talent pretty quickly.  I don't think he does while we still have Brees."
Saints,33zlf0,flordeliest,3,Mon Apr 27 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points, though I think 2 years is alright for a QB to sit and develop (I think the issue of sitting longer is that it completely wastes the rookie contract and forces the team to offer a big contract before the QB is proven), and I think we'll have a bad year with terrible QB play, but I don't think it will be with Brees."
Saints,33zlf0,sfzen,5,Mon Apr 27 05:27:38 2015 UTC,I think 2 years is alright for a QB to sit and develop   See if we still had Joe Lombardi I might feel differently.
Saints,33zlf0,flordeliest,2,Mon Apr 27 08:08:16 2015 UTC,True. I've got no idea what to expect from Neu.
Saints,33zlf0,sfzen,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:26:09 2015 UTC,Yes but an unproven QB doesn't get the big contract either. He gets the midlevel contract. There's a decent chance we'd be getting a steal.
Saints,33zlf0,LSUsparky,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:37:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know. If he has a decent year or two as a starter, he could absolutely demand a huge contract. If we don't give it to him, someone else would."

Saints,33zlf0,xbaited,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:25:17 2015 UTC,I expect our cap to be fucked as long as Brees is still on the books.   Our cap issues are about to become way more manageable though. This year was(at least as it looks so far) the last year of cap hell.
Saints,33zlf0,VegasSaint9,-1,Mon Apr 27 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"Next season is going to be tight too, especially with a new contract for Jordan and Hicks. Also, if Josh Hill does make the jump to starter like a lot of people expect, then he's going to be paid too.   Same can be said if Leilto becomes a solid starter, and if the person who is to become our No. 3 receiver is one of Morgan, Toon or Tanner.  We're probably going to loose Bush and Khiry to free agency no matter what."
Saints,33zlf0,VegasSaint9,2,Mon Apr 27 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"If Jordan and Hicks play like they did last year, we'll have a boatload of money compared to the last couple years. We should trade bush and or Khiry IMO while they contain any sort of value."
Saints,33zlf0,VegasSaint9,0,Mon Apr 27 17:56:53 2015 UTC,"Hicks and Jordan were not bad last year. Jordan had a break out season in 2013, but you're not going to sustain a high sack total playing his position unless you're an absolute freak like JJ Watt. Rob Ryan's defense relies on pressure from linebackers. Any pressure generated by the line is bonus. Hicks' and Jordan's main job is gap assignment, not beating a tackle off the line. Last season they spent more time in a read and react scheme than a pass rush scheme."
Saints,33zlf0,VegasSaint9,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:11:26 2015 UTC,"Jordan was solid, but not great. Hicks was a disappointment. They barely moved anyone this year. Also I swear RR says he tries to create pressure from the front four not the linebackers."
Saints,33zlf0,jdim83,0,Mon Apr 27 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"He might have said that, but that's never been the case outside of the 2013 season. It may just be semantics on how he classifies Galette (or Anthony Spencer in Dallas) since they play with their hand in the dirt as often as standing up."
Saints,33zlf0,smokeajay,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"True. We seem to play more 4-3 due to lack of personnel. So I guess that could be the reason why. It looked like last year when teams figured that we don't get a lot of interior pressure they just started throwing our edge rushers a little farther back so the QB could just step up. And when we couldnt get our edge pressure like in '13 RR decided to start blitzing our LBs which seemed to work 50/50, but still not what I would call ""effective,"" or ""impactful."""
Saints,33zlf0,sfzen,0,Mon Apr 27 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest, which might not be a shared opinion here, but I just don't think Rob's system works."
Saints,33zlf0,daybreaker,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:07:21 2015 UTC,I think it works if you have elite linebackers and an elite secondary. Which is borderline impossible. I don't think after last year too many people disagree. He's never really been consistently average as far as total defense. I like that we signed Dennis Allen though.
Saints,33zlf0,Jaime-Foxx,0,Mon Apr 27 19:10:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying except Payton finding a replacement after Brees is gone. I think they both leave within a year or two of each other. Brees first (retirement or crappy trade) and the Payton gets fired because ""what have you done for me lately"" it's a sucks scenario but it's the way of the league."
Saints,33zlf0,Jaime-Foxx,2,Mon Apr 27 08:02:42 2015 UTC,"A contract extension for a year, possibly two.  Not that I am wanting to draft a QB."
Saints,33zlf0,Jaime-Foxx,2,Mon Apr 27 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think Payton and Brees will have everything planned out. Brees will tell Payton exactly how long he intends to play, and Payton will extend Brees' contract to whenever that is (probably one year at a time). I'm 100% confident Brees will be the Saints' starting QB at the time of his retirement."
Saints,33zlf0,Jaime-Foxx,1 point,Mon Apr 27 05:31:10 2015 UTC,"Brees could potentially sign a 2 year extension after this season to clear up some cap space in 2016. With the cap going up, we could find ourselves close to $30-$40mil under the cap with Cam Jordan as our only free agent.  This means between having tons of draft picks this year, and lots of cap space next year, I think we make our final mega-push with Brees in 2016-2018, with 2015 as kind of a lagniappe year to see what we have in our rookies.  Because of that, I cant see us drafting a QB to sit for 4 seasons. I mean, if we can get Petty in the 5th, why not? But I dont think we should draft one on day one or two.  Maybe get a QB next year, that way he's starting in year 3 or 4, which gives us a year or two to see what he has before deciding to pick up his 5th year option."
Saints,33zlf0,Jaime-Foxx,0,Mon Apr 27 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Jordan isn't the only free agent to sign. We have a potential of needing to resign 5 starters and at least three solid contributors depending on if Josh Hill is the real deal at TE, Lelito wins the LG battle, and Haralson and Hicks staying the starters. We also have to make a decision on Robinson, Bush and potentially who ever wins the WR3 slot if we retain them or not."

Saints,33tq47,avaryvox,12,Sat Apr 25 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"it would make sense in some ways, but the salary cap restricts the move. He'd have to agree to a massive paycut; we weren't able to pay jennings enough to bring him here, and we don't even have the space to convert Mathis' hit into a roster bonus without a salary reduction AND an extension (only one year on contract).  given his age, it's more than a moon shot"
Saints,33tq47,serenity_suppository,4,Sat Apr 25 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"Thank the lord we dont have that salary cap room for this move. This may be one of the dumbest trades I've ever heard. One injury and this guys career is over. He's good, but he's 33, how long do you expect that to work? A good O-line needs chemistry as well."
Saints,33tq47,VegasSaint9,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:17:15 2015 UTC,"Loomis seems to be able to create space on the cap everytime he finds a person worth creating that space for.   And yeah Mathis is old, but his on field production is still very high. I just love the idea of getting the best OL available... Because we have a two year window to really win big."
Saints,33tq47,VegasSaint9,2,Sun Apr 26 10:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think its a huge waste. He's good, but what if this is the year his production declines? Maybe for a later pick. I just dont see how it could be that beneficial.  We lose cap space which is what we've tried hard to do, plus lose a pick, and theres no guarantee he will be good here."
Saints,33tq47,pfiffocracy,2,Sun Apr 26 15:35:32 2015 UTC,I agree with the previous post. We cannot afford Evan Mathis. This is a Madden-like trade.
Saints,33tq47,serenity_suppository,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"Loomis ALREADY worked his magic...  I clearly outlined  the possible scenarios to make it work, but it doesn't seem feasible to guarantee ~3 future years of bonuses to a player of this age, no matter the caliber (qbs are the exception). We'd need to reduce BOTH his salary years by at least 4 million; it's IMPOSSIBLE without squandering future cap, which we've already pushed a bit.  We need the money next year to re-sign players like hicks, probably hill, and definitely Jordan.  It's. not. going. to. happen."
Saints,33tq47,sfzen,9,Sun Apr 26 19:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think we'll trade, and maybe with the Eagles, but we definitely won't be trading for Mathis. He's way to expensive, and he's already 33. It's entirely possible that the Eagles draft a rookie and cut him to save money. I'd rather stick with Lelito or draft a rookie.   I think we'll be trading up, not down. We have 9 picks this year, and the last time we took more than 6 players was 2007. We tend to trade up more than we trade down. We tend to get 2 or 3 players from every draft that really contribute. We have more picks than we're going to use, and there's plenty of worthy talent we can move up and take. My only question is do we move up from #31 into the 20's, or do we move up from #13 into the top 10?"
Saints,33tq47,Enrico-pallazzo,2,Sat Apr 25 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"We did an ""Expert"" (loosely phrased with me) mock draft and the Saints pick always end with OL, but Vic Beasley is the one guy in this whole draft who fits the profile of what Rob Ryan wants.   So you might be right on both counts. A move up from 13 and a move down from 31. The team is lining up to be a major player in the draft this year. Should be fun."
Saints,33tq47,Simplename64,3,Sun Apr 26 10:05:40 2015 UTC,"Good work - not bad for taking a decade off! Cant wait for the draft to see Loomis do his thing. In years past, it seems we trade up more than down with our early selections. I could see us changing that trend this year since we need to firm up a few areas on both sides."

Saints,33tq47,quantumhed,3,Sat Apr 25 16:11:37 2015 UTC,"I like the last two points, and that suggests and interesting trade for us., and it would be great. Unfortunately I don't think there's any way the Eagles trade Mathis just to move up in the draft. Are we also sure Hundley wouldn't be available by the next Eagles pick? I don't buy that move at all for the Eagles.  Also, we traded Jimmy for Max, so if anyone has the expectation of being as valuable as Jimmy it would be Max (at least in my eyes) and what we get in the draft is something of a bonus, as we also gave them a 4th.   Great analysis overall, but I'm sure the eagles won't give up their HOFer just to move up."
Saints,33tq47,quantumhed,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"Hundley is a real Wildcard. I've seen him projected at Mid-First and then some in the Fourth. Now that Chip Kelly has full control of the Eagles and if the Draft goes like Free Agency... The Eagles are going to be unpredictable.    Also, we traded Jimmy for Max, so if anyone has the expectation of being as valuable as Jimmy it would be Max (at least in my eyes) and what we get in the draft is something of a bonus, as we also gave them a 4th.   I love the Max Unger trade... Dude is dynamite. But the media will likely tag #31 as the Jimmy Graham pick. Still I'm guessing about that. I don't have any concrete info on it.   Great analysis overall, but I'm sure the eagles won't give up their HOFer just to move up.    Thanks... I work hard it."
Saints,33tq47,dean815,3,Sun Apr 26 10:26:07 2015 UTC,"I like this trade if we were to get Kendricks as opposed to Mathis, based on money. Kendricks is only ~1.4 million against the cap this season and on a contract year. Then we can get Ali Marpet from Hobart later in the draft."
Saints,33tq47,VegasSaint9,2,Sat Apr 25 18:34:39 2015 UTC,"Kendricks is a good player. I'd be excited to see how they would utilize his skill set.   Ali Marpet is a Saints kind of guy.

Only you can determine if the passes are worth it, in the end. As for your specific question, you will not really have the opportunity to meet any players or get any autographs. There are two separate warm-ups. The players come out for individual warm-ups and most have a very specific ritual that they will not deviate from and most are also wearing headphones. Next, they all come back out for organized stretching and position group drills. Again, they are out there to warm-up and prepare for the game, so there is very little to no interaction."

My dad always had Suite tickets and boxes at the Superdome through his work, but one day he got field passes and we were down there for awhile.  We were playing the Lions and I got to be like 10 feet from Barry Sanders while he warmed up, so as a child that was pretty awesome.  I think it was just past the Dome Patrol era, because I remember seeing Morten Andersen, but not Rickey or Sam Mills or anybody.  Maybe Tyrogne Hughes too. Like the other poster said, I'm fairly sure we had a certain time limit to be down there, and only certain places we could stand or walk around.

I regret not getting there earlier, so get in as soon as you possibly can. Several of the fans had a bunch of autographs from the first round of warmups, but once the team comes out together I did not see much fan interaction. My stepmom did get an autograph from Sean Payton, and it was great to see everything so close. I did get to high five a few of the players as they went back to the locker room (Graham, Galette).  I won these passes and do not know how much they cost. I was surprised by how many fans were actually down on the field as I thought it was going to feel a little more exclusive.  OH! I also got to stand like 10 yards away when they were doing the pregame chant. Although the game didn't really mean anything I envisioned that in my mind for a long time."

I've lost the use of my Sproles and Henderson(Huge LSU fan also) jersey and thankfully Raf put on 25 so my Bush jersey can stay relevant, but I'd like a new one as well.

Spiller could be a fun player if he stays healthy and I know Payton will use him correctly and I was also thinking Browner but I might hold off to see how many costly PIs he pulls."

I like Beasley but I prefer a player with more utility, plus we can't really afford another OLB who is a liability against the run and zero coverage ability. As bad as our pass defense was we ranked worse in terms of rushing defense. In all honesty we lost more games from run defense than passing. We need to stop the run before we try to amass sacks."
Saints,33nneb,flordeliest,9,Fri Apr 24 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"I agree. Bud dupree and Gregory will probably be available at 13, and with that 31st pick we should draft an ILB."

Saints,33nneb,superduperpooperman,0,Fri Apr 24 11:20:03 2015 UTC,Dorsett doesn't seem like anything more than a deep threat. Brees doesn't have the arm to utilize the deep threats we already have.
Saints,33nneb,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:44:13 2015 UTC,"What deep threats do we have? Joe Morgan is a head case who may not even make the team, Toon is a posession guy.

Saints,33nneb,CallMeGerbraldo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:59:07 2015 UTC,Cooks and Morgan. Brees got picked of going deep like four times last year because he under threw it. Have you forgotten?
Saints,33nneb,flordeliest,2,Fri Apr 24 04:15:51 2015 UTC,"Also have to pay attention to the pocket. Brees couldn't step up and deliver like he normally does. I admit that Brees does not have the strongest arm, but I think many people seem to exaggerate his lack of strength."

Saints,33nneb,lossaysswag,4,Fri Apr 24 13:16:30 2015 UTC,Oh god I hope not. I really don't like Beasley. I don't like any player that does one thing well but is average to good in everything else. I would much rather take two LBs in the first or trade back for picks than to reach for Beasley.

Saints,33mvtr,Hedgery,3,Thu Apr 23 22:16:22 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think of is he's asking way too much money. He drops WAY too many passes to making starting TE money. He's probably wanting $3-$4M a season when he's a $1-$2M talent.
Saints,33mvtr,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 23 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no reason to rush it I suppose. I can't imagine he would just go unsigned."

Saints,33mvtr,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:25:18 2015 UTC,He wouldn't be a significant upgrade over Hill/Watson/Charles. Why sign him when we have these guys even cheaper?
Saints,33mvtr,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:40:38 2015 UTC,Charles hasnt done jack shit since hes been in the NFL other than that one time he got arrested for pulling a gun in traffic. Watson is almost purely blocking and leadership at this point. If Josh Hill gets hurt we are completely fucked at TE.
Saints,33mvtr,sfzen,0,Thu Apr 23 22:58:42 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say how much of an upgrade he'd be over Hill and Charles since neither of them have ever had significant playing time, and Watson is just a blocking tight end at this point in his career."

Saints,33lxr7,makeplayz,3,Thu Apr 23 19:41:43 2015 UTC,"Just because you're drafting now, doesn't mean you expect him to go soon. Aaron Rodger sat behind Favre for 3 years before getting to start and he was supposed to be a #1 overall pick. It's not too far off to think we might take a guy who needs a little more time to develop since we have multiple first and third round picks this year"
Saints,33lxr7,CKitch26,0,Thu Apr 23 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Outside of Aaron Rodgers, what other QB sat behind a future hall of famer for seasons before a smooth transition to starting QB?"
Saints,33lxr7,Saints2Death,3,Thu Apr 23 20:22:39 2015 UTC,So do you want us to just wait and hope a first round talent is available that can immediately step in when the time comes?
Saints,33lxr7,CKitch26,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:25:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. Let's play out Brees' career and find someone to replace him after he's gone. The whole develop a QB behind the starter is bullshit. The vast majority of above average QBs in the league started at some point their rookie season. Just because Rodgers was developed the way he was doesn't mean it can be duplicated. In fact, he's the only QB to be developed that way in the past 30 years."
Saints,33lxr7,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 23 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"So because he's the only one, means it can't be replicated? I have faith in Peyton and the offensive coaches to develop somebody."
Saints,33lxr7,CKitch26,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly. Replicating Rodgers is as sure of thing as replicating Tom Brady. IT would be stupid to wait till the 6th round to draft a QB because Brady was found in the 6th round. That doesn't mean that it can't be replicated, but it would be dumb to try.   These are the QBs that were drafted as imediate starters or became the starter at some point during their rookie season:  Peyton Manning  Eli Manning  Ben Roethlisberger  Andrew Luck  Matt Ryan  Matt Stafford  Ryan Tannehill    Joe Flacco  Jay Cutler   Russell Wilson   Andy Dalton   Alex Smith  Cam Newton    Nick Foles   Not to mention RGIII, Bridgewater, Carr, Bortles, and Mettenberger."

Your query had nothing about who drafted him. Plus, the environment was different back then because of the USFL and other factors (no cap, no FA, etc).

Saints,33lxr7,sfzen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"I could see us using a 5th rounder one of them if they fall, but I doubt we would take a QB as high as the 3rd."
Saints,33lxr7,Hedgery,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:52:21 2015 UTC,"I hope this is just the Saints doing their due diligence. If the Saints use any of their first five picks on a QB, I'll be pretty upset as there should be some solid players for them in the first three rounds for them to pick from who will actually make an impact, as opposed to picking a backup QB who you don't really want to play and if he does your screwed anyway. I'd rather them pick a player who might actually make an impact and provide good depth and play some snaps as opposed to a QB, as I'm fine with their situation at QB for now. I know everyone wants them to pick a young QB so that they can start grooming Brees's successor, but it's not worth wasting a pick on a guy who isn't ever going to start. For every Tom Brady and Russell Wilson who is a QB taken outside the top two rounds that pans out, there's another boatload of QBs who never ended up playing a snap or who weren't cut out for the NFL if they did. Saints need to get players who can help this year or over the next couple of years, whether its a WR/TE/OL to help the offense or a LB/DL/CB to help the D, but not a QB. Too many other areas that could use the help more and that would be far more worth a draft pick."

Saints,33ltvt,haledann,2,Thu Apr 23 16:03:14 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but aside from LB, NT is our defenses next greatest need. We need someone to eat up blocks and anchor the middle."
Saints,33ltvt,Megawatts19,3,Fri Apr 24 07:19:41 2015 UTC,"Shelton. It's hard to find dominant nose tackles at 13. If he's still there, we should snatch him up."
Saints,33ltvt,bootscallahan,3,Thu Apr 23 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"Dupree. Yes he may be a bit of a project, but he's a freak athlete and some of the other options scare me. Randy Gregory has major character concerns and I'd be terrified if we drafted him. With Parker, wide receiver is not a necessity for us at the moment compared to some of the holes on the defensive side of the ball, so we should pass on him. Finally, Shelton seems like a good fit, but pass rusher/OLB is more of a pressing need for us than defensive tackle."
Saints,33ltvt,504_SAiNTS,3,Thu Apr 23 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"It would be close between Dupree and Shelton. I'll say Shelton, since this draft has much better depth as pass rusher than nose tackle. I wouldn't mind Gregory either, but only if the coaches are 100% certain his off-field issues won't be a problem."
Saints,33ltvt,sfzen,3,Thu Apr 23 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"Shelton basically ends us getting ran all over and gives us the rock we need in he center of the line. On the other hand Dupree has size to set the edge and speed to never get beat to the sideline. He would  improve the run defense just as much, and if he can learn to rush with more than athleticism and use his hands then he is a pro-bowler. But a solid NT is so rare.  It comes down to how the front office feels about Jenkins and NT in the rest of the draft  I think we should be calling Gregory's problem with addiction ""character concerns"" instead of ""off-field issues"". Those are completely different things."
Saints,33ltvt,flordeliest,3,Thu Apr 23 23:17:25 2015 UTC,"I like Jenkins, but I don't like Bunkley, and we need someone that can rotate and compete with Jenkins, and Shelton would be a much better fit next to Hicks at DT when we line up in a 4-3.  And yeah, I just kind of use ""character concerns"" and ""off-field issues"" interchangeably. Gregory's particular character concerns do keep him off of the field, though, which is an issue."
Saints,33ltvt,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:29:31 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to gamble that Goldman is available at 31.
Saints,33ltvt,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:26:09 2015 UTC,I agree with Shelton. But just because Randy Gregory failed a drug test doesn't make him a drug addict.
Saints,33ltvt,dean815,0,Fri Apr 24 00:03:03 2015 UTC,I'm only saying that because he has said he has struggled with addiction.
Saints,33ltvt,flordeliest,2,Fri Apr 24 00:19:24 2015 UTC,Addicted to pot lol

Saints,33ltvt,flordeliest,3,Fri Apr 24 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"You have to take Gregory IMO. He'd be a lock for the top 5 if he didn't fail the drug test. He has the ceiling to be the best player in this draft. If you pass on him, give me Parker. The impact he can have could be enormous. Dupree is too much of a project for us right now for me to take him over Parker or Gregory. I'd consider Shelton over Parker but the impact he would have, would probably be the nearly the same as a DT we could get in the later rounds. Whereas a wr in the later rounds won't give us Parker's size combined with his abilities after the catch and in the endzone. I personally like Malcolm Brown more than Shelton anyway."
Saints,33ltvt,evtine,-2,Thu Apr 23 19:09:54 2015 UTC,what are you talking about? the wr position is loaded this year
Saints,33ltvt,Easybrees09,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:04:12 2015 UTC,Are we going to find a future #1 receiver like Parker later in the draft? No. Can we find a run-stuffing NT later in the draft? Yes. That's what I'm saying.
Saints,33ltvt,evtine,5,Fri Apr 24 03:17:52 2015 UTC,Gregory. All he did was smoke a little weed. He's a pretty smart guy and they'll know whether or not he's going to be trouble.
Saints,33ltvt,dean815,3,Thu Apr 23 17:15:36 2015 UTC,All he did was smoke weed... Which could lead to suspension. He does us no good if he's suspended. Plus we've been looking for non-troublemakers
Saints,33ltvt,Briguy_fieri,2,Thu Apr 23 17:20:44 2015 UTC,Well I'm saying that he isn't a troublemaker. Smoking weed is something a lot of people do. If he can earn their trust there's no other reason to think he's a problem. He will likely be under heavy scrutiny by the drug program so I don't think he will be smoking weed for a while.
Saints,33ltvt,dean815,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:25:38 2015 UTC,The fact he smokes pot and can lead to the team losing him for an extended period of time is a trouble maker. That's putting your wants ahead of the team's needs. It's the definition of a troublemaker. I have no problem with people smoking pot. But the NFL sees it as a punishable act. So because my team is hurt by a suspension yeah I have an issue wasting a high (pun intended) draft pick on him.
Saints,33ltvt,Briguy_fieri,0,Fri Apr 24 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"Probably the best answer here. My guy at 13 for the Saints has been Marcus Peters, because I know realistically that better options such as Fowler, Beasley, Scherff, White and Cooper will all be off the board before then, so Peters, who in my opinion is the top CB in this draft class and has potential to be very good, is my guy for them at 13, but that's a little bit early for him, but not too early to actually take him there. But if the Texans, Chargers or Chiefs wanted to move up to grab one of the guys listed above, and the Saints could move back and likely still get Peters while accumulating more picks, then that would be ideal, assuming the others listed above are off the board."
Saints,33ltvt,Hedgery,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:45:28 2015 UTC,I like the way you think. That would be ideal really.

Saints,33ltvt,neovenator250,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:16:42 2015 UTC,I might be one of the few out there but I really like Brandon Scherff if he is there at 13.  He has 10 year pro bowl guard or right tackle written all over him.

Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"Gregory. Parker shouldn't even be considered IMO. Shelton would be a great fit too, but I think Gregory will be a pro bowler for years to come."
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:35:55 2015 UTC,Just what we need another guy with off the field problems on defense.
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,2,Fri Apr 24 05:08:43 2015 UTC,"Failing a drug test is not the same thing as off the field problems. He never got in any kind of legal trouble, he just got high like any normal college kid. It's the smallest infraction there is. Josh Gordon fucking up like 5 times is scaring people away, but people almost always learn their lesson the first time. He's basically the honey badger."
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,5,Thu Apr 23 16:05:33 2015 UTC,"Look im all for smoking and chilling but when you KNOW FOR A FACT that you will be drug tested at the combine at that point the smart thing to do is to not smoke.   Dude is an idiot, I'm sorry but if I have a choice of getting high and having my draft stock falling and not getting high and getting paid more then the choice seems pretty clear to me. I mean how long did he have to really stay sober before the combine... like 40 days max?"
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:20:55 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he isn't an idiot. I'm saying that failing a drug test is not the same thing as off the field issues.
Saints,33ltvt,dean815,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"You are right Gregory is by far the best talent available at that point with those players available.... but I don't think we should be taking a guy that's a ""maybe"" guy at that point.  Plus all that dumb twitter stuff with new Orleans just don't think this guy has the highest reasoning."
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:30:28 2015 UTC,It sounds like the definition of an off the field issue to me.
Saints,33ltvt,flordeliest,0,Thu Apr 23 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"Not to me. Off the field concerns to me are run ins with the law, IE breaking the law or getting arrested. A failed drug test is in its on zone between on and off the field IMO. I understand it's an odd standpoint, but that's how I classify it."
Saints,33ltvt,Lokipokie504,0,Thu Apr 23 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"I understand (and agree) that in general, smoking pot isn't really a big deal. However, with how heavy handed the NFL gets with suspensions, and with Gregory knowing 100% he was going to get drug tested going in to the combine and still failing, I'm just seeing Josh Gordon 2.0.    The guy's talent doesn't matter if he won't be on the field because he's too stupid to not break league rules.    Further, Louisiana isn't exactly progressive when it comes to marijuana laws so he could easily end up getting arrested for it. Or a dumb DUI situation like Leveon Bell."
Saints,33ltvt,harveyfjord,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:43:45 2015 UTC,That's a lot to assume from one failed test. I can't find any other cases of him doing something bad. One failed test is not a pattern.
Saints,33ltvt,Charizard_Targaryen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:07:14 2015 UTC,"I am saying he isn't an idiot. I've seen the dude talk and he seems a hell of a lot smarter than most of the other edge rushers in the draft. People make mistakes and this might be a mistake that drops a good player in our laps, so why don't we let the front office figure out if his personal life is a concern and focus on the player?"
Saints,33ltvt,harveyfjord,1 point,Thu Apr 23 22:15:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard any interviews. And I didn't say he was an idiot, I just said that I didn't say he wasn't lol either way, he made an idiotic mistake that will cost him thousands of dollars."

Saints,33ltvt,harveyfjord,4,Thu Apr 23 23:10:52 2015 UTC,That would be a major reach. There's a decent chance he's still there at 31.
Saints,33ltvt,Charizard_Targaryen,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"It is a reach, my reason for it though is that there really are quite a few teams looking for an ILB (at least 5 probably 6 or 7) and about 6 decent ILB's in the draft.  I do not believe Kendricks will fall past Indy, Cleveland, Arizona, and Greenbay to be there at 31.  Plus, Chicago, Cleveland, and NYG will all pick before us in the second meaning that potentially 3 or 4 good ILB's will be gone if we wait until the second round.  We need multiple ILB's and the circumstances of this draft favor reaching."
Saints,33ltvt,jffm114,2,Thu Apr 23 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"How can you make such an outlandish statement? There is ""zero chance"".....ZERO? Absolutely none? Impossible? According to several mock drafts by people who are paid to predict these things, he isn't going in he first round. Two examples here:  http://mweb.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/mock-draft  http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/mock-drafts/bucky-brooks/245613  Mel kiper also has him falling to the second round in his most recent draft. Don't try to make the argument that Kiper sucks and he has no idea where anyone is going, because he and everyone else who I've posted are more qualified than you or I to assess draft prospects.  As for your assessment that he definitely isn't getting past Green Bay, here is a mock from a guy who covers the Packers and writes for a Wisconsin newspaper, and it states that he believes it is more likely that the Packers draft Paul Dawson.   http://m.jsonline.com/sports/packers/tcu-playmaker-paul-dawson-could-sharpen-edge-on-packers-defense-b99483081z1-300974741.html  Having a differing opinion is great, but your word isn't fact. Saying stuff like that totally discredits your statements."
Saints,33ltvt,RobertB91,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:15:13 2015 UTC,Would it become a fact if Green Bay does in fact draft him though?
Saints,33ltvt,Easybrees09,2,Thu Apr 23 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think something can ""become a fact."" Webster defines a fact as : ""something that truly exists or happens : something that has actual existence."" It seems to me that something is only a fact if it is an existing, verifiable piece of information at the time it is spoken. Otherwise, it's just a prediction come true."
Saints,33ltvt,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"But then you agree that ""Greenbay will draft Eric Kendricks with the thirtieth pick in the first round"" is a fact, even right now, if it turns out that they do draft him there.  Note that that isn't phrased as a prediction and the definition that you gave yourself doesn't say anything about whether you can know of the facts existence, just that it exists.  In this case the fact either exists or it does not exist, but in the former case, it exists and your lack of knowledge of its existence doesn't affect it's existence as a fact."
Saints,33ltvt,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:23:52 2015 UTC,"I don't see that as anything more than a prediction. I could understand if it were an inevitable scenario. For example, death. Though you haven't died, it is scientifically impossible to never die. Saying ""I will someday die"" Isn't a prediction. There is no scenario in which death can be evaded forever. Can you put that kind of confidence into saying ""Green Bay will draft Eric Kendricks?"" If not, then as the statement is spoken, it is not factual. There is no hard evidence to support Green Bay drafting Kendricks."

Saints,33hbg2,VegasSaint9,5,Wed Apr 22 14:59:52 2015 UTC,What exactly has Beasley done to have his stock drop? ... I hate this time of year.
Saints,33hbg2,Saints2Death,4,Wed Apr 22 16:41:26 2015 UTC,Draft stock isn't real per se. Its basically the media catching up to how teams evaluate a prospect. And the closer we get to the draft the more accurate the picture becomes. Like now Gurley is apparently going top ten.
Saints,33hbg2,Saints2Death,4,Wed Apr 22 17:36:36 2015 UTC,We never get a more accurate picture of the draft combine. This is all speculation to gain web traffic.
Saints,33hbg2,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 22 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"Prospects rise and fall all the time, it depends on how much teams decide he's worth. Teams typically have their boards done right after the combine. The rising and falling is media's evaluation of a prospect. Of course its for web traffic but to say it never becomes somewhat more clear isnt right."
Saints,33hbg2,Lokipokie504,3,Wed Apr 22 18:33:20 2015 UTC,"We aren't getting any information from teams. This is all speculation from analysts. We have no clue what any team is doing.

Saints,33hbg2,Lokipokie504,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"I think with all of Gregory's talent he'll be more of a bust because he wont be able to keep it together. Its really tough, I don't think you can go wrong with any of these guys at the moment."
Saints,33hbg2,quantumhed,2,Wed Apr 22 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Well Gregory got it done on the field, while the other 2 were not amazing while playing. That to me says 2 things about them. Either their coaches didn't know how to use them properly, or they simply weren't that good. With a pick that early, it's a little worrisome to go with someone like that. I've only watched a bare minimum of all 3, but Gregory looked the best on the field to me. I would rather take a chance on a guy who proved it on the field IMO, but I can understand feeling the former."

Saints,33ez6j,MengTheBarbarian,10,Wed Apr 22 00:43:31 2015 UTC,Those first 7 games are gonna be pretty tough barring Tampa Bay (maybe).
Saints,33ez6j,DaggersKnuckles,2,Wed Apr 22 00:04:36 2015 UTC,I agree. I can see 2 or 3 losses in there. Even 4 is possible. But at least it's the first 7 games and not the last 7.
Saints,33ez6j,colby347_1,3,Wed Apr 22 00:59:12 2015 UTC,Very true. I'd rather have a tough start than a tough finish. That week 11 bye is also really nice
Saints,33ez6j,DaggersKnuckles,2,Wed Apr 22 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"I'm personally a fan of earlier byes around week 6-7. It's more mid season when you factor in the wear on the players through training camp and preseason, plus it gives you time to fix your problems from the start of the season.   If we can be in good shape for the playoffs by week 11 though, the rest time will be welcome."
Saints,33ez6j,shryne,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:46:23 2015 UTC,"I hear ya man. I just feel like with how our schedule is set up, having a bye after a rough tough half of the schedule will be key to finishing strong. But I agree that an early bye would be pretty helpful in terms of giving the coaching staff more time to fix certain issues with the team. Hopefully they can manage to adjust as the games go by instead."
Saints,33ez6j,DaggersKnuckles,9,Wed Apr 22 07:05:54 2015 UTC,The only part I don't like is that we travel to Philly and then have a short week against the Falcons.

Saints,33ez6j,sophandros,3,Wed Apr 22 00:08:23 2015 UTC,"Tulane @ GA Tech wouldn't be a very big game. Also, Saints @ Cardinals would be exciting since it's opening week, and I'd expect Arizona fans to be pretty friendly since we don't really have a rivalry, and they've got a bunch of LSU guys.  So it kind of depends on what you want. If you want exciting, and probably a better game, I'd go NFL. If you want to get the alumni hookup, go with the college game."

Saints,33ez6j,OGMoose,2,Wed Apr 22 11:16:38 2015 UTC,That is a tough start. Away game vs the Cards should not be taken lightly nor any division game. But going from @Cards to Bucs to @Panthers? That could easily be a 1-2 start or even 0-3. Really wish they would have tossed us a bone and got a home game for the opener and not so many division games so early.
Saints,33ez6j,platypuspracticus,3,Wed Apr 22 00:10:44 2015 UTC,"I think they made the schedules for our division interesting. They also made Atlanta start off with Eagles, @Giants, @Dallas."
Saints,33ez6j,Jthan254,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"But they start off at home with a very winnable game and then go away to the Giants which is even more winnable. Our game against the Cards can definitely be won but they have a pretty strong defense and being in AZ will put our offense through a pretty tough challenge just in week 1 rather less going back home to face a division rival that has a strong defense and an unknown commodity in their QB in week 2 (assuming they take whoever at #1 and have him starting from day 1). THEN after that, facing ANOTHER division rival with the Panthers game and that one will be worse because it's an away game. That's a pretty tiring start for a team and can definitely set us up for starting off the season on a bad foot."
Saints,33ez6j,platypuspracticus,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:30:28 2015 UTC,I appreciate the realism but I do think that your blowing it out of proportion. It's not as hard as a start as you're playing it up to be. I wouldn't want to open against the eagles (nobody knows at all what to expect) and @dallas will be no cake walk either.
Saints,33ez6j,USNthrowawa,1 point,Wed Apr 22 07:35:34 2015 UTC,I would. I'd love to be against the Eagles at home then playing the Giants next. That can easily be 2-0 going into Dallas and at that point losing one isn't that bad.
Saints,33ez6j,platypuspracticus,2,Thu Apr 23 01:30:30 2015 UTC,Tough start but better than have all the playoff teams be dialed in and play them in weeks 10-16. The end of the schedule looks like a cake walk.
Saints,33ez6j,VegasSaint9,2,Wed Apr 22 00:27:23 2015 UTC,I agree but I'm very big on the idea that how you start the season dictates the pacing for the rest of it. It may not completely tank us but going 0-3 might affect the psyche of players enough to where that end of season cakewalk ends up being a run of .500 and dropping the away games.
Saints,33ez6j,platypuspracticus,2,Wed Apr 22 00:36:59 2015 UTC,aka the 2014 season?
Saints,33ez6j,SleepingAntz,3,Wed Apr 22 01:25:55 2015 UTC,Yup. And I was saying that season also had an ugly start to it. It does actually matter and impacts the season as a whole and not just those games as isolated incidents.
Saints,33ez6j,platypuspracticus,2,Wed Apr 22 01:36:25 2015 UTC,Brutal start but an encouraging slate of teams to finish.  I like it

Saints,33ez6j,rjohnston11,2,Wed Apr 22 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"Best bet is going to be StubHub or Ticket City. You can scalp at/around the Dome but I much prefer the peace of mind that comes with knowing price ahead of time.   As far as when you want to buy, that's up to you. Start tracking them daily as soon as they go up. They'll change with draft hype, records of the two teams, etc. The market sets the price.   My suggestion: set a floor and ceiling price. If the ticket prices go below your floor, or start to approach your ceiling, pull the trigger."

Saints,33f6hd,jffm114,4,Wed Apr 22 00:53:37 2015 UTC,"I would personally lean towards Dupree. You're not going to find an EDGE as versatile as him in the 2nd, 3rd, +. We can find quality OGs in those rounds tho. IMO Dupree is one of the few players with the potential to be the best player from this draft in 4-5 years."
Saints,33f6hd,Brees2Graham,6,Wed Apr 22 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if he doesn't develop at all he is still a contributor as a run stopper and as someone who can make plays in space, immediately locking down the Sam opposite of Galette. If he can learn anything about passrushing he can have eventually be a DE or Jack. It not even a contest with Gregory having both size and off field issues and taking lineman at 16 to play guard was pretty stupid for Dallas, even though it worked out its still was shit positional value.  I don't understand why people think Payton would entertain the idea of starting a rookie on the O-line. We had to go through several games of horrid play from Charles Brown, and it took a blow out against the Rams before Armstead even got a shot, after Harris and even trying  Strief at LT at one point. We would likely need Lelito and Kelemete and half the back-ups on the roster to bomb during the regular season before any rookie LG sees the field. This is just one of several reasons why Schreff isn't going to happen, the biggest being our defense.  Now that I think about it we went into the season with Charles Brown to start at LT after Bushrod left and only took Armstead in the 3rd round.

Saints,33f6hd,MistaChopstix,2,Wed Apr 22 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Close second to Gregory. Scherff is as polished and NFL ready an offensive lineman has been in the last few drafts. Gregory would probably make an impact, but Scherff WILL make an immediate impact."

Saints,33czu5,baconlovr,2,Tue Apr 21 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"I was hoping, with fingers crossed that I could buy direct and not have to pay a re-seller's markup.   Is this just not possible with the season ticket structure? Is every seat in the dome someone's season ticket?"
Saints,33czu5,redog,4,Tue Apr 21 15:26:38 2015 UTC,Season ticket holder here. I have not gotten tickets yet so cannot sell them. The markup on ticketexchange is about 10% so normally I sell mine on the street for 10% less than TixEx. Usually you can find tickets right before the game still. If you purchase early you might save a lot on big games however. $50-200 on the upper level seats depending upon the venue. I've gotten lower level seats for $140 before but I've seen the same ones at $500 for big venue games.

For us it will be a large undertaking as we will be traveling from southern California. Flights, hotel, car, etc.  Thank you for your ticket holder perspective!  I was hoping to get my tickets as soon as possible to at least ensure the whole trip will result in seeing the actual game. I am accustomed to buying resold tickets for all other sporting events pretty much right up until gameday, but those events we care much less about our seats.   I wanted to try and get them as early as possible so I had a better selection of pricing and availability. Since it seems I will be buying them resold, I just want to make sure I don't miss some window of opportunity.....like when we are inevitably undefeated and Superbowl bound! (thus all sold-out)"

Saints,33czu5,redog,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:29:43 2015 UTC,I just want to make sure I don't miss some window of opportunity   Solid reasoning. When i get my tickets I usually list them for ridicilious amounts. Just incase someone bites. If I am not going to attend a game I will drop the price one or two weeks before the game to a bit above what's selling on TickEx and gradually drop the price until game day where I'll set it to the going rate.  A buddy of mine sold 2 on the street to the Saints-Panthers game on game day at the end of the year for $40 each when they were going for about $100 on ticket Exchange. I had sold mine the week before for $100 each cash. If they had sold at the beginning of the season I had them listed at $150 each.
Saints,33czu5,baconlovr,3,Tue Apr 21 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Have been to about 4 home games a season these last 2 years, my experience has yielded the following...   The Ticket Exchange is cheaper than stub hub or any other online reseller 100% or perhaps 99.9999999% of the time, so I don't even bother with the other ones.  It is also typically cheaper than ticket master. You can time when you buy the tickets to try and get them lower than normal, generally, the following is true: Saints are doing poorly - prices go down noticeably and the prices go up if the Saints are doing well.  The same is true of the opposing team. The opposing team is travelling from a long distance - prices go down somewhat. The opposing team has a fanbase that really doesn't give a shit (like the Bucs) - prices go down The date of the game is 2 days away or less - prices go down somewhat. The tickets just went on sale - prices are somewhat lower. About a week or two before the game - prices are somewhat higher. Night Games don't seem to be more expensive than Sunday games. I generally feel like I've gotten a good deal if I get an upper level seat for ~70 dollars or less or a lower terrace seat for ~$100.  $50 tickets are sometimes out there but it's fairly rare."
Saints,33czu5,baconlovr,2,Tue Apr 21 18:22:00 2015 UTC,I think you nailed it.   Sub 70$ tickets are probably just more noticeably available around me since I deal with other ticketholders and they'll trade me good prices for the same in kind deals at other times. Mine are upper terrace endzone and I absolutely love the view. Almost like playing madden.
Saints,33czu5,baconlovr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"If you're getting it from Ticket Exchange, you're still going to see a small markup. The only way you won't have any markups is buying them straight from the ticket booth at the stadium around gameday. Everyone needs to make a living, even ticket sellers. It really all depends on what team the Saints are playing the week you want to see them. You can take the risk of getting them the day of, but it is a risk and you may not get good tickets or anything at all.  Side note: If you're a veteran and can get access to Tickets and Tours on a military base, they usually sell gameday tickets super cheap the weekend they open. I got two $200+ tickets to the Saints/Broncos game a few years ago for $80 a pop."

Saints,33def0,SaintsComeMarchingIn,9,Tue Apr 21 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"If you notice when we won the super bowl we didn't have a ""go-to"" man. I think Graham being our go-to man has hurt us in the past. Sure he produced, but any Saints fan will admit that he went a little soft versus a truly physical Defense, and we still threw the ball to him when he was blanketed by two or three guys. Don't get me wrong, Cooks, Spiller and others will make some big plays, but we don't need it to be totally predictable like it has been in the past. Look for Brees to make everyone better with an improved line. I would be fine without anyone breaking records or becoming a huge fantasy player. I really want to see results in the win column."
Saints,33def0,jffm114,-10,Tue Apr 21 17:31:19 2015 UTC,U srs? Bush was the go to. Jimmy was the new Bush. Bush was often used as a diversion and is why we won. Jimmy was the same way. Just sort of fell apart when he stopped being a serious threat.
Saints,33def0,SoberJudgeJudy,3,Tue Apr 21 19:22:01 2015 UTC,"To a degree (Cardinals game), but defenses weren't honing in on him like they were with Graham. They were trying to matchup with Colston and Moore, lookout for Shockey running slants, stop Pierre in the screen game, and stop the run. We were not nearly as one dimensional as we have been. It used to be double Graham, and watch Sproles for the check down. Then last year it was just double Graham (especially when Cooks went down)."
Saints,33def0,jffm114,7,Tue Apr 21 19:28:08 2015 UTC,"First off, we have to take in consideration that Brees is going to get his. He's attempted over 600 passes 7 of the last 8 years. Even with a higher emphasis in the running game, I still plan on him throwing over 600 passes. This offseason we lost half those targets with Graham (125), Stills (83), Thomas (53) and Cadet (51). Brees has to make up for those targets. Colston is playing right at max production with about 100 targets. He could increases his production by limiting his drops, but he'll only get about 100 targets next season again.   Cooks is going to be the greatest benefactor here. He was on pace to get 84 targets last season. We can pretty much double that next season to 160 targets. He should be a lock for 1,000 yards and 6 to 8 TDs. Don't expect a Antonio Brown breakout season, but expect a break out season for Cooks.   I think we need to curb our expectations of Hill drastically. Only two TEs went over 1,000 yards last season and only four had double digit touchdowns. 2015 is his first year as a starter, and you can't expect him to be Top 5 out of the gate. He had very limited snaps last season and was on the practice squad in 2013.   If he breaks 500 yards and 5 TDs next season, lets celebrate him. That's putting him around Top 15 TE in yards and Top 10 TE in Tds. Any more than 500 and 5 TDs is a great season. This will put him getting about 80 targets (Gresham had 460 yards, 5 Tds on 79 targets last season).  CJ Spiller has to absorb over 100 targets himself to satisfy what PT and Cadet did out of the back field. I don't think that will happen, but I expect him to get around 70 at least. That should get him close to 700 yards and 2 or 3 TDs.  This means Colston, Cooks, Hill and Spiller should rack in 410 of Brees 600 targets., which leaves 190 targets up for grabs.   Ingram and Watson should get about 30 targets a piece. And another 100 targets should go to miscellaneous targets. That leaves about 30 targets Brees needs to find. I think we have the WR corps that could do this, but I'd like to find someone in this draft that could get roughly half of those miscellaneous touches, mainly around the goal line, and be the guy that eventually replaces Colston. I have ZERO faith in Morgan and Toon being anything more than they are right now. We might have to start one of them, but I don't expect much out of either. Coleman or Jones could be this guy, but I think it would be easier finding him in the draft."
Saints,33def0,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:53:18 2015 UTC,I think the team is higher on Cooks than people think. He's shown the small guy burner skills like TY Hilton and was fantastic in intermediate routes last year. He's been working with Antonio Brown a little this offseason and if he can get his footwork even close to that level he has the skillset to be a superstar.
Saints,33def0,dean815,2,Thu Apr 23 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"Oh me too. I think 160 targets might be a little aggressive, but I think he's going to get the lion's share of the targets lost with Graham and Stills."
Saints,33def0,Saints2Death,6,Thu Apr 23 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I think Drew Brees is a pretty good player. You heard it here first, keep an eye out for that guy. He's gonna turn some heads."
Saints,33def0,defeatedbycables,2,Tue Apr 21 19:24:34 2015 UTC,No way after that shoulder injury. He's done. His career is over.
Saints,33def0,VegasSaint9,3,Tue Apr 21 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"It's Cooks, Spiller, and Ingram. We may get another play maker through FA, but I'm hoping they spend draft picks on Defense or O-Line."
Saints,33def0,kweeche,2,Tue Apr 21 16:56:08 2015 UTC,"I think Cooks will be our best receiver this year but I think they will try to get Coleman in heavy in the preseason, probably will get a rookie int he 2nd-4th round this year, and Josh Hill will probably be expected to do a lot. I think he absolutely can although he isn't as imposing as JG."

Saints,33bgk7,Karamaar,6,Tue Apr 21 05:36:47 2015 UTC,"He didn't really do anything last season. He played 8 defensive snaps against Detroit, and a total of 30 special teams snaps over the course of the season. No stats recorded.   I know he was always going to be a project. I know we didn't want to throw him into the fire. But holy shit, I'm hating the fact that we drafted him. I'm hating the fact that I was super fucking excited when we drafted him. Why the fuck did we draft him in the 2nd round if he wasn't going to touch the field? 4th round? Yeah, cool, whatever. Not a 2nd rounder. The next 5 picks were Jack Mewhort, Kony Ealy, Allen Robinson, Jimmy Garoppolo, and Jarvis Landry. All promising guys that will be starters this season, except for Garoppolo, who looks like he'll be ready to lead the Pats when Brady retires. SJB couldn't get more than 8 snaps in the dumpster fire that was our secondary. I understand giving rookies time, but that's a big flaming red flag to me."

Sure, SJB has great physical potential, but I just don't have a lot of confidence when it comes to us knowing how to coach him up."

If there is a higher rated defensive player available at that spot, my guess is we go defense. But it will depend on how Loomis, Payton, and Ireland have the players ranked. I wouldn't be surprised to see us pass on someone like Randy Gregory or Bud Dupree because our front office has Parker ranked higher. On the other hand I wouldn't be surprised to see us pass on Parker for Arik Armstead if he is still there.

It's speculated that a number of the teams around our pick have interest in a receiver and if Parker makes it to 13 that means a number of pass rushers that we like could have dropped out of the top 12.  I've seen speculation that Dupree and Gregory could make it past the first 20 picks.  I guess my OP was made with the impression that there are multiple defensive players we like that fell, though it would make more sense to trade down if all the pass rushers are gone."

I'm hoping Jaelen Strong falls to 31, but I'm also perfectly happy waiting. There is plenty of talent in the middle rounds at WR. We have absolutely no reason to reach for a WR in the 1st."
Saints,339lkf,sfzen,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"Im to the point where if Fowler, Beasely, Gregory, & Ray are gone; Then I want Devante. If Cooks goes down, our receiving group would be well below average. Devante comes in as a playmaker from day 1. You can't be sure about that with too many guys this year. He needs fine-tuning in a few areas, but just imagine how much Colston could teach him technique-wise. How much space he could open for Cooks and Colston to work underneath. And it would give us another guy that is great when running a screen for, so if we do move to a more west coast system, it will be more dangerous. I hope we go defense with 2 of our first 3 picks for sure but if Devante is there and the pass rushers are gone, I'd be very happy with Parker."
Saints,339lkf,evtine,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:39:13 2015 UTC,"I mean it just really depends on who's still available.  If it's between say Parker, Waynes or Mariota, then yes, Parker should probably be the pick. Although Malcom Brown wouldn't be a terrible option in that situation.  However, if somebody like Dupree, Gregory or Shelton is still available at 13 we should take one of them over Parker."
Saints,339lkf,Brees2Graham,0,Mon Apr 20 22:38:46 2015 UTC,I hope we do. The only WR I'd take in that spot is Cooper.

Saints,336tab,chezizzle,4,Mon Apr 20 07:45:46 2015 UTC,"You know that's right.  EDIT:  They actually make fun him being in Holes a few times.  One of the times was actually this line.  Another one was when Gus didn't know that the movie existed (I couldn't find the clip, so a link to IMDB will have to do)"
Saints,336tab,oddmanout,6,Mon Apr 20 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see it more like this when people tell him he has no cap space this offseason."
Saints,336tab,MarchMadnessisMe,5,Mon Apr 20 14:06:52 2015 UTC,Haha I love how everyone was saying the Saints had no way out & Loomis pulled the Loodoo to shut everyone up
Saints,336tab,mankstar,4,Mon Apr 20 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair to everyone else, if someone had told me that this offseason was going to see us part ways with PT, Lofton, Grubbs, Graham, and Stills, I would have been shocked. Don't get me wrong, with the exception of losing PT, I'm not disappointed by any means. Would have liked to see Thomas play another year with us, but I'm not dissing our current RB situation by any means."
Saints,337tpy,nixonator1,12,Mon Apr 20 09:33:52 2015 UTC,"No. If he was worthy of being a starter, he would have beat out Foles and Sanchez. He's a journeyman back up. Nothing more nothing less."
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,2,Mon Apr 20 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure the verdict is out on him yet as a back up only. He's still really young for a quarterback, at this stage of his career the chargers were preparing to draft Rivers and move on from Brees as well. Chip Kellys system is really unique in its structure, and really asks its qb to manage the tempo more than offense itself. Coming from USC, I just wonder if Barkley would do better in a system like ours which stresses execution on short and immediate passes with the occasional deep ball."
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,2,Mon Apr 20 15:31:02 2015 UTC,"You can argue system all you want, but the best qb always wins the job. He was the 3rd qb behind Foles and Sanchez, not necessarily the greatest company. He can't beat those guys out, but you think he can be the heir apparent to Brees? I'd rather take a chance on an unknown commodity, than a known semi-skilled guy."
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,2,Mon Apr 20 17:09:05 2015 UTC,System isn't everything but it definitely plays a part. Brees is definitely a different qb under Payton than with Schottenheimer. Guys like Warner and Alex Smith got written off long before the right set of coaches helped them develop.
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:38:12 2015 UTC,"Warner came out of nowhere, and Alex smith still had starting jobs. I just don't see anything special in Barkley. He played 2 games that I can remember and he didn't score and had like 3 TO's in each game. He has an average arm and poor decision making. He'll never be a starter IMO. He's maybe worth bringing in as a camp body, but not as a trade and only for the minimum."
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"In all truth you're probably right, maybe Barkley never develops or maybe he does. There are 32 teams and not all of those have quality starting quarterbacks. So its a really rare combination of intelligence, skill, physical tools and coaching to make a qb successful. But look at the value we have gotten from our 5th, 6th and 7th round picks lately. Guys like Fortt and Tavon Rooks who get passed over on the depth chart by undrafted role players. Late round picks are really nothing more than guys you hope will become something. Sometimes they do, like Colston or Evans, but most times they don't. I wouldnt mind trading the hope on one of those picks on the hope for a guy who was considered a top first round kind of guy before getting hurt his senior year."
Saints,337tpy,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:44:25 2015 UTC,"I mean when it comes down to it, nobody knows. But I wouldn't be happy with it. I'd rather take a chance on a guy in the draft, or keep rolling with Griffin. I never thought Barkley was 1st round material, and I basically see him as no more than a 3rd string QB. At least with Griffin he knows the system already, and you have an unknown factor with a new guy. If you can't even beat out Sanchez for the number 2 spot, you don't  have what it takes to be a starting QB."
Saints,337tpy,evtine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess only time will tell. Nonetheless, I'd much rather us have an abundance of talent at the qb spot than question marks behind Brees."
Saints,337tpy,evtine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:17:05 2015 UTC,That's revisionist history. There's a shit load of other information you're leaving out in that scenario
Saints,337tpy,evtine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:40:08 2015 UTC,"They drafted Rivers 4th because Drew WASNT that good at the time. This was before the new draft pay scale was in place, and they had already paid Rivers a shit load of money, while Drew was on the last year of his contract. THEN, he tore his labrum, making them HAVE to go with Rivers at that point."
Saints,337tpy,Cytoma,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:52:57 2015 UTC,This kind of speaks to my point though. After 2 years Drew had struggled so much that the Chargers were ready to move on and drafted Rivers. After 2 years Barkley has failed to climb the depth chart over veterans and when getting spot playing time has been a disappointment. But the verdict on his career isnt really settled after 2 years.
Saints,337tpy,PABLOricardo,5,Mon Apr 20 20:06:20 2015 UTC,No. He's probably not even better than Ryan Griffin at this point.
Saints,337tpy,VegasSaint9,0,Tue Apr 21 16:31:29 2015 UTC,That's so difficult to guess at since we have seen so little of Ryan. Having the two of them together to develop through next year might give us the chance to pick between the better of the two when Brees decides to retire. The investment to us would be low.
Saints,337tpy,K1BBL3ZnT1TZ,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:05:19 2015 UTC,Neither of them are future starting quarterbacks. Especially Barkley. I hope our plan is better than turning over the reigns to a 3rd string-caliber QB when our HOFer retires.
Saints,337tpy,harveyfjord,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, although at this point we have shown virtually no interest in finding a qb"
Saints,337tpy,Ztbill,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:35:22 2015 UTC,"That was me being sarcastic mostly. Sorry. But I think next year is when we draft a QB high. I'd love Cardale Jones or Conner Cook. With Hackenburg and some others, next year's class should be a good one to where we could get one of those guys at a decent spot."
Saints,336k5d,jffm114,10,Mon Apr 20 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"Kendricks, by far. He's the best in coverage, and has a knack for big plays. Something you can't teach, and something we've been missing since 09."

Saints,336k5d,VegasSaint9,2,Tue Apr 21 13:43:09 2015 UTC,I'm going to avoid the obvious top guys and jump to late rounders Ben Heeney and Kwon Alexander.
Saints,336k5d,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think Alexander falls into the 4th, personally."
Saints,336k5d,sfzen,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:30:36 2015 UTC,Ben Heeney is the most intriguing LB in this draft. Because he is a leader with production and he has a monstrous Sparq score.   Other than size he is dynamite.
Saints,336k5d,avaryvox,2,Wed Apr 22 08:01:03 2015 UTC,I doubt his frame is full and his production is amazing despite the terrible D-line in front of him.

Preferably they land one of them at 44 and use 31 on another player, but if we can land one or two of those LBs it would be a huge boost to our defense."
Saints,336k5d,Hedgery,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"Kendricks or Anthony easily. Shaq Thompson after them. But if we can't get those guys, I'd like Taiwon Jones from Michigan State in the 5th."
Saints,336k5d,evtine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:54:16 2015 UTC,"I love the build of Taiwan Jones. I think he may be very underrated. People are concerned with having a 3 down LB, but we could play him for first and second and then bring Ellerbe in to cover 3rd down. Defintely wouldn't mind us grabbing him if other guys are off the board"
Saints,336k5d,dean815,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:12:44 2015 UTC,"I think what we really need is a guy who can make all the open field tackles, who has the smarts and work ethic and leadership to anchor the defense. I'd pick Kendricks over Thompson there. I don't really see either of them being successful moving to strong safety but I think there's plenty of reason to believe they'd succeed at WILB. I do like what I've seen of McKinney and Anthony, and they are both huge guys who could probably bring more versatility to the table."
Saints,336k5d,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think Kendricks is the best now, but I think Anthony has the highest ceiling. Watching a couple games of his, you realize that he's all instinct and athleticism, and has been incredibly productive."

Saints,33338u,steamerslane,11,Sun Apr 19 01:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly surprised he hasn't been signed yet. The only reason I can think of would be that he must be asking for too much money. Sure, he's 30, but he can do literally anything you need him to, and he doesn't need to get many touches to be effective. He fits into any offense.  I think the Jets would be a good place for him to end up. The only RB's on their roster are Ivory, Powell, and Richardson. Thomas would be a huge upgrade as a receiving back and 3rd down guy."
Saints,33338u,sfzen,8,Sun Apr 19 02:18:37 2015 UTC,"The Jets signed Stevan Ridley, so I'm not sure they're in the market. I could see the Patriots giving PT a call. They lost Ridley and Vereen in free agency, and they always value do-it-all veteran RBs like Corey Dillon, Kevin Faulk and Pierre. It'll probably be at the veteran minimum though."
Saints,33338u,bootscallahan,3,Sun Apr 19 03:05:08 2015 UTC,He could end up back here of we are lucky. I still have zero confidence in our current RBs' pass blocking ability.
Saints,33338u,flordeliest,2,Sun Apr 19 03:22:19 2015 UTC,"I'd love to have him back if we can, but it just brings up the same issue of a crowded backfield we've had recently. Ingram is our feature back, so he'll get most of the carries, Spiller is our receiving and change-of-pace back, and Robinson is our bruiser goal-line back. Thomas would be a great guy to have, but he wouldn't get the touches he deserves. He's good enough to be a #2 RB, and it's in his best interest to go somewhere else."
Saints,33338u,sfzen,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about carries, I'm worried about blocking, which we know Robinson and Ingram aren't very good at. RB blocking was.a huge part of Brees ' increased amount of pressure last year."

He's a vet who can pick up an offense pretty quickly if you need him. There are plenty running backs in the draft to check out before signing a 30 year old vet for more than what a rookie contract will be.

Saints,32y1ka,Bigheadparker,-2,Fri Apr 17 18:41:29 2015 UTC,Because any compliment you give women now is always deemed as sexist.

Saints,32xpkj,ashsky,9,Fri Apr 17 16:06:34 2015 UTC,"This was his last scheduled visit of the off-season and so, I assume he's going to his family & agent or something now to potentially decide on where he would like to play.  Edit: Apparently we're still in the mix for him but going from the last paragraph in that article, I assumed that we may not get him but it is unclear."
Saints,32xpkj,avaryvox,3,Fri Apr 17 16:07:52 2015 UTC,I hope not... Jennings gives us more Draft flexibility and hopefully it's a contract that we can get done.
Saints,32xpkj,ULMmmMMMm,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:35:19 2015 UTC,It'd be nice to get a 2nd round Jordan Matthews type or something.

Saints,32xpkj,Saints2Death,5,Fri Apr 17 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"It appears New Orleans’ plan is to have Marques Colston and Brandin Cooks at the top of the depth chart, with Nick Toon, Seantavius Jones, Joe Morgan and Brandon Coleman fighting for snaps behind them.>    That bit. Although, some other articles have stated New Orleans are still in the mix so I shall edit the edit."
Saints,32xpkj,Saints2Death,3,Fri Apr 17 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"Well our depth chart is very misleading. Very few situations have us running two TEs or a TE, RB and FB. A good 90% of the time we have at least three receivers on the field. And as a vet, Jennings should know that Brees doesn't think in No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. If you get open, you catch passes. It's why over the past 4 seasons, we've had no less than 4 guys a season catch 50+ passes."
Saints,32xpkj,serenity_suppository,6,Fri Apr 17 18:37:04 2015 UTC,"For Jennings, I'm not too sure whether he's looking to put on some final stats, try and win another super bowl or have a final payday. That's what I think it's going to come down to and if his answer is either the first or second option, he may choose us as out of the teams that offered, I feel we have the best chance of getting a ring and doing well."

Saints,32tulw,whodat951,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:48:30 2015 UTC,This sums it up.   Jennings is a consistent good character guy that has a couple of good years left.   This would be a Patriot type of signing. The older vet who comes in and really contributes on the way to a Superbowl.
Saints,32tulw,avaryvox,17,Sat Apr 18 13:10:59 2015 UTC,This would be a good signing for us on so many levels.
Saints,32tulw,makeplayz,10,Thu Apr 16 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"Provided its for the right price, Ill be happy with this."
Saints,32tulw,The_Don12,7,Thu Apr 16 18:41:10 2015 UTC,I saw this hype last year when we got Champ Bailey only to see him get cut in training camp. Cautiously optimistic.
Saints,32tulw,Evernoob,2,Thu Apr 16 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"Champ was 35, Jennings is 31. Huge difference in football. Once you get past 30 might as well add every year like dog years. Its just to plug a hole so we don't force WR in the draft."
Saints,32tulw,VegasSaint9,4,Fri Apr 17 15:31:50 2015 UTC,Drew did say he was hoping for that pro bowl veteran.
Saints,32tulw,haledann,5,Thu Apr 16 19:22:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? I mean I'd love to have that kind of talent for Brees, but won't he be asking for more money than we can afford right now?"
Saints,32tulw,baconlovr,6,Thu Apr 16 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about that too, we only have 4 mil in cap space (mostly for rookies) which'd most probably be the salary he's looking for.. Not sure how we'd make room for him. Need some Loomis magic to sort it out."
Saints,32tulw,baconlovr,8,Thu Apr 16 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"It would probably be back-ended to hell, which would suck. But if he's a necessary playmaker then I'm for it, I guess."
Saints,32tulw,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 16 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"I stopped second guessing moves after they are signed. Loomis sees things differently, and it generally works."
Saints,32tulw,BootsBean,5,Thu Apr 16 19:43:13 2015 UTC,I wonder if he'd take a discount to play with a QB that's as talented as Brees.
Saints,32tulw,mbluhm36420,3,Thu Apr 16 20:38:42 2015 UTC,Didn't do it for Rodgers so who knows.

Saints,32tulw,mbluhm36420,2,Fri Apr 17 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"While it's worth considering, I believe when he left GB he was a FA for the first time so chasing the paycheck could've been a higher priority to him at that point in his career. At this point in his career he may just want to play for contender, but like I said who knows."
Saints,32tulw,hMJem,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:57:44 2015 UTC,Packers offered him more than the Vikings did. He settled out of embarrassment thinking he was worth more than he was.
Saints,32tulw,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"On the flipside, he may not take one because Brees won't give him as many touches as he'd like."
Saints,32tulw,overratedfood,0,Thu Apr 16 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"He accepted something close to a $40 million deal to have Christian Ponder of all QBs throw to him, I bet he'd be willing to take less if it means the ball actually ends up within his reach when it comes his way."
Saints,32tulw,johall,2,Fri Apr 17 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"Does he want a ring or money? You can have enough money, can never have enough rings."

Saints,32t4d7,GreenVisorOfJustice,4,Thu Apr 16 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Well I just bought one from China for $22.00. I have my receipt. Do you think he will help me out?
Saints,32t4d7,Dj_Nussdog,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:18:56 2015 UTC,Seems like this should go on Spiller's tab
Saints,32t4d7,ToddNew,5,Fri Apr 17 22:13:42 2015 UTC,Maybe Spiller wants to go back to 28?
Saints,32t4d7,jberg624,2,Thu Apr 16 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"Um, they already gave CJ Spiller #21, so if he does change then it'll be #23.  BTW, didn't Ingram give up #28 for him? Seems like that's a big deal and he's just wanting to jump to another number."
Saints,32t4d7,baconlovr,12,Thu Apr 16 14:39:40 2015 UTC,I think it was more of Ingram wanted 22 (the number he had at Alabama) rather than Lewis wanting 28
Saints,32uetu,baconlovr,2,Thu Apr 16 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"For the lazy, what did he say?"

Saints,32t0ly,VegasSaint9,5,Thu Apr 16 14:01:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely Kendricks or Anthony. I know CB isn't the greatest need for us anymore but if Kendricks is gone, and Byron Jones is there at 31, I really want him. I think he's going to be a STAR. And then a trade up to ensure we get Anthony if that were the case.   If We draft a TE, I hope it's Darren Waller from G Tech in the 5th.   I also hope we draft the best kicker in the class. I don't care if we spend the 6th rounder on him. It may be Justin Manton from Louisiana-Monroe. I wish that kid from FSU declared."
Saints,32t0ly,evtine,2,Thu Apr 16 14:10:12 2015 UTC,"My only concern with Byron Jones is that he'll possibly become Patrick Robinson 2.0 and I'd rather get someone who has outstanding technique. I like Anthony a tad better than Kendricks because Anthony seems more explosive, he may be a reach at 31, but I think he's gonna be awesome."
Saints,32t0ly,CKitch26,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:14:45 2015 UTC,Is Darren Waller going to be a TE in the NFL? He's listed as a 3-4round WR on nfl.com
Saints,32t0ly,Twistify804,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:20:46 2015 UTC,He could be a Jimmy Graham like player. Line up at WR and at TE.
Saints,32t0ly,Acipere,3,Thu Apr 16 19:08:42 2015 UTC,I want Amari Cooper. 2 star receivers for Brees at the end of his career will make me happy.

Saints,32t0ly,Mudkipz137,2,Thu Apr 16 23:34:35 2015 UTC,"I want O line. I want to shore it up, I think it will help Brees give him time in the pocket and give Ingram better running lanes.  That being said I don't know much about the draft or strategies so I won't presume I am correct.  My second thing I'd want us to look at is defense, LB."
Saints,32t0ly,Iwouldlikealongeruse,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:12:03 2015 UTC,Kenny Bell. He might last to us in the 5th round and I can see him doing what Stills has done for us the last few years. I wouldn't mind picking him up even if we take a WR early. As long as that WR is a bigger guy like DGB or Devante Parker.   Bell can stretch the field and has solid hands on deep routes and knows how to go up and get the ball and bring it down in bounds if its along the sideline. I don't know if he will last to one of our 5th round picks but I like what he could do for us.
Saints,32t0ly,leulzy,2,Thu Apr 16 19:18:59 2015 UTC,I want Kenny Bell also.
Saints,32t0ly,ashsky,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"As someone who goes to UNL and that has been to a number of husker football games, I wanted to give my two cents. I love Kenny Bell as a person and think he has one of the best personalities I've ever experienced and is exactly the kind of person I'd want in the Saints locker room. That being said, I've never been impressed by his hands. He's a good receiver and probably has never played for a decent quarterback his entire college career, but I've never once said to myself ""wow he caught that"". Now that being said, it's my only real criticism of the guy. Did you see his hit in the Big10 championship a few years back? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rbLGtBvK9I"
Saints,32t0ly,btdawson,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:54:35 2015 UTC,"I really badly want a top guard. La'el or Scherff at 13 if either falls which i doubt or someone like AJ Cann as early as 31 but most likely in the 2nd. I just have a feeling that if we can nail down the O-Line, everything else will fall into place. With time in the pocket, Brees would be able to carve up any defense in the entire league and I feel that's what we should aim to having in the early rounds. A single top talent LG can achieve that barring injury.  Also ILB but I'm starting to like nearly all top ILB now instead of just Kendricks (who is still amazing) but they all have such huge potential. Someone like Perryman and McKinney may be extremely raw in pass coverage, Dawson may be slow at times, Anthony may struggle against the run occasionally but damn, they all have huge upside. Any of them along with a good guard and I'd be extremely pleased as we'd have solid foundations set in place."

Saints,32rxi9,sart0rial,3,Thu Apr 16 05:42:57 2015 UTC,We're 4.4 under now. Getting Cam to sign an extension could save us 2-4 million.
Saints,32rxi9,evtine,2,Thu Apr 16 14:14:18 2015 UTC,The draft shouldn't take more than 4 mil.  Where are you pulling that 7m number from?
Saints,32rxi9,moralesupport,2,Thu Apr 16 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"I took it from here: http://overthecap.com/draft  Disregard, I quoted the pool...  Not the effective cap hit."
Saints,32rxi9,moralesupport,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:18:13 2015 UTC,Gotcha.  Yea the cap hits that are around 500k are basically a cap hit of zero.  They will just push another player out of the cap or they won't make enough to impact it anyway.
Saints,32rxi9,cfiggis,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:50:24 2015 UTC,I think I saw Mike Triplette say that we needed about 3 mil for rookies.
Saints,32rxi9,dean815,2,Thu Apr 16 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I posted the rookie pool #.  Apparently the cap hit is the Rookie Pool – ($435,000 x number of picks)."
Saints,32quqs,jace_supreme,3,Wed Apr 15 23:53:11 2015 UTC,"I think we definitely need to pick up at least one OG and one OT in the draft, but I'd definitely rather go with DL or LB with #13. I'm much more confident with our OL than I am with our front 7. There are a lot of good OL in the middle rounds.  I like Cann and Tomlinson in the 2nd, I like Jackson, Matias, Miller, and Kouandjio at OG and Ogbuehi and Havenstein at OT in the 3rd."
Saints,32quqs,sfzen,2,Thu Apr 16 02:32:28 2015 UTC,I'd take the best olineman in the draft than the 5th best LB/DL.
Saints,32quqs,Saints2Death,3,Thu Apr 16 04:19:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I think Shelton would be the 2nd best 3-4 DL, and would realistically be available, and after Beasley and Fowler, it's kind of a bit debatable tie for #3 pass rusher, and the top 5 pass rushers are all arguably top ~10 talents, so the 5th best DL/LB could very easily be BPA at #13.  Personally, I think the talent gap at pass rusher between the top 13 and rounds 2/3 is bigger than the talent gap at OL."
Saints,32quqs,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:46:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shelton makes it to us honestly, but I agree with that pick if he's available. I wouldn't be mad with either honestly, but I think both will be picked before us."
Saints,32quqs,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:56:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Scherff will go in the top 10. I think Shelton has a good chance of falling to us, though. At #13, we're in a spot this year where we really just have to wait and see what happens. There's a lot of different ways it could tun out, and a lot of different guys that could be available for us. Always difficult to predict when you're just barely outside of the top 10."
Saints,32quqs,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"The way I see it playing out, our real options are going to be Collins, Gregory, Ray, and Dupree."
Saints,32quqs,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:02:38 2015 UTC,Entirely likely. I'd take Dupree out of those four.
Saints,32quqs,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:23:29 2015 UTC,"I'll take Gregor if we go defense or Collins if we go offense. Parker will be available too, but I think he's a step back from White and Cooper."
Saints,32quqs,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'm just not as high on Parker as everyone else seems to be. I think he's a top 20 prospect, but I don't think he would be anywhere near good enough value for us to take at #13 over a DL, LB, or OL."
Saints,32quqs,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:27:36 2015 UTC,"Agree. Honestly I'd only want Cooper at 13. And I agree at DL, LB, and OL is probably the value at 13. CB too, but I don't see Waynes getting past the Giants."
Saints,32quqs,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:31:05 2015 UTC,I'd wager we are taking two lineman with between the third and fifth. I don't think it's likely we take one high.
Saints,32quqs,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:26:56 2015 UTC,no way Scherff makes it past 10
Saints,32quqs,swamptech,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think we'll get a couple lineman in the first 5 picks. If Scherff does make it to us at 13, I think we'd be stupid not to draft him, but I don't see him getting out of the Top 10."
Saints,32ov3p,Bouzal,4,Wed Apr 15 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"Not a bad move in all honesty. In case Unger doesn't pan out and gets hurt, we still have Lelito as a guard with a designated center backup, not a tackle/guard filling in..."
Saints,32ov3p,hryfrcnsnnts,5,Wed Apr 15 15:54:48 2015 UTC,So I guess this means the Saints will be talked about more on Mike & Mike? This is probably due to the Saints moving Lelito to a tackle position so we need a backup for Unger.
Saints,32ov3p,baconlovr,2,Wed Apr 15 17:20:56 2015 UTC,guard
Saints,32ov3p,Saints2Death,4,Wed Apr 15 17:53:58 2015 UTC,seems like a pretty good depth move
Saints,32ov3p,vinslol,4,Wed Apr 15 16:16:50 2015 UTC,So I'm guessing this means that Lelito is definitely moving to guard now.
Saints,32ov3p,Lokipokie504,11,Wed Apr 15 15:16:30 2015 UTC,Doubt really seriously that Golic makes the team.
Saints,32ov3p,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 15 16:47:36 2015 UTC,Probably not. But that's at least the thought process behind this it seems

Saints,32peou,jffm114,12,Wed Apr 15 17:22:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely in the 6'1""-6'3"" variety that's reliable. That's all I ask. If we get the next Dez Bryant, hell yeah, but if we just get a serviceable WR like Colston has been I'm ok with it."
Saints,32peou,makeplayz,8,Wed Apr 15 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"We need someone that we can use in the red zone. That's the only spot I worry about not having Graham.

Unless Cooper or White some how falls to us at 13, or Green-Beckham is around in the 2nd, I think we should wait until the 3rd at the bare minimum."

Saints,32peou,hryfrcnsnnts,2,Wed Apr 15 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"I vote red zone threat, big guy that can replace Jimmy (not that they will replace his value, but at least a reasonable target)"
Saints,32peou,Mudkipz137,3,Thu Apr 16 00:09:58 2015 UTC,"Possession guy, preferably. 6'1"" or taller, with good hands, decent redzone target. We basically just need a replacement for Colston. Cooks can play the slot role or the deep threat, Morgan is a deep threat, Meachem (if he makes the roster) is sot of a deep threat in the slot usually. Toon has improved a lot, but I'm not ready to rely on him yet, and Coleman hasn't one anything to earn a roster spot."
Saints,32peou,sfzen,1 point,Wed Apr 15 19:32:33 2015 UTC,I can't see a WR being drafted anywhere in the first two rounds. It's just not as high a priority as other positions are at this time.
Saints,32peou,baconlovr,3,Wed Apr 15 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"The only way I'd be happy with it is if Cooper falls to us at 13. I think he's the best football player in this draft, and I'd be ecstatic if we got him there."
Saints,32peou,Lokipokie504,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:25:45 2015 UTC,I think it's about who's on the board. I don't think we will use either of the first two picks at wr unless white/cooper fall but our second round picks we might be able to land jalen strong or devin funchess
Saints,32o78c,commiebastard_,2,Wed Apr 15 11:00:12 2015 UTC,Don't the fact that he failed drug tests so close to the combine . Don't like the fact that he didn't like NO in his tweets someone who shows that kinda of lack of mental str. is a weak link.
Saints,32o78c,haledann,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"That breakdown went from pretty good to obsessive pretty fast. There are a few fundamental problems with the way he was used in college that wont translate very well to the NFL but I wouldn't be mad if the Saints took him.   He would however, be expected to bulk and rush a lot more than he did in college which will slow him down and take away some of his run stopping ability."
Saints,32o78c,ShrimpSandwich1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:05:28 2015 UTC,"Bulking would actually improve his run stopping, not hinder it."
Saints,32o78c,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:17:20 2015 UTC,"I meant the bulking would slow him down, and his technique would hinder his run stopping. Where ever he lands, he will be asked to power rush a lot more than he has been. This change will hurt his ability to run stop because he wont be reading the outside mans first move, which allows him to better stop the run. Bulking will help for sure but his technique will hurt him more."
Saints,32o78c,ShrimpSandwich1,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:22:20 2015 UTC,"It depends. He's actually bigger than a guy like Cameron Wake, who's speed and technique outweighs the fact that he's on the slender side. If he continues to get better, bulking is not entirely essential."
Saints,32o78c,Lokipokie504,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:20:46 2015 UTC,"Its convincing as far as play, but he DOES still have the pot issue (as silly as that is in this day).  Wouldn't be upset if we picked him up."
Saints,32o78c,brokenearth02,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:43:42 2015 UTC,Oh its about that? Fucking lame. He's probably so zeroed in on the field because of it. He looks disciplined as hell mentally as far as this video is concerned.
Saints,32lkzs,Saints2Death,16,Tue Apr 14 19:38:58 2015 UTC,Wouldn't be upset with signing Jennings for the right price. Instant replacement for Stills (at least in the short-run).
Saints,32lkzs,jffm114,2,Tue Apr 14 19:48:52 2015 UTC,Morgan was Stills' replacement.
Saints,32lkzs,PatSayJack,15,Tue Apr 14 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"Morgan signed a 1-year vet minimum deal with a $15,000 signing bonus. He's no one's replacement. He's just a camp body who probably won't make the team."
Saints,32lkzs,Wolverigne,29,Tue Apr 14 21:06:36 2015 UTC,Morgan was Morgans replacement...
Saints,32lkzs,PatSayJack,8,Tue Apr 14 22:13:57 2015 UTC,"simple, but true."
Saints,32lkzs,Frohirrim,4,Tue Apr 14 22:15:30 2015 UTC,"He's just a camp body who probably won't make the team.   If he can keep his shit personality under control, I think he could be our best receiver behind Cooks."
Saints,32lkzs,PatSayJack,7,Tue Apr 14 21:22:23 2015 UTC,"I think he's going to get cut before training camp, off field issues or not. He's been in the NFL since 2011 on the most pass happy team in the league. If he was going to have a break out season, I'd think it would have happened by now."
Saints,32lkzs,PatSayJack,7,Tue Apr 14 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"Very true. Same (sort of) could be said for Toon, however. He's still there."
Saints,32lkzs,DaveThe_blank_,4,Tue Apr 14 21:57:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think Toon is going to break out either honestly. I think we need to find someone in free agency or the draft. On the roster currently, I think Coleman is the only one that we don't know what he is, and he's going to have to improve his hands before he ever breaks the lineup."
Saints,32lkzs,jace_supreme,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"He keeps almost doing it and getting shut down for off the field locker room issues.  When he shuts the fuck up, puts the bottle down and runs routes correctly, he's deadly."
Saints,32lkzs,didntevenwarmupdho,3,Tue Apr 14 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"He catches less than 50% of the passes thrown to him, and he basically just runs one route. He's only been good on blown coverage really."
Saints,32lkzs,typical0,2,Tue Apr 14 21:52:44 2015 UTC,Your sample size is too small for that stat to mean anything.  By your logic he also averages 33.6 yards per catch.
Saints,32lkzs,TweetPoster,3,Tue Apr 14 21:58:55 2015 UTC,My sample size is 4 years. And in four years he ran one pattern and basically only caught the ball in blown coverage.

Saints,32lkzs,olbleedyeyes,14,Tue Apr 14 21:40:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not really surprised he's sill considering us even though MIA and JAX offered good deals. I think since this is probably his last rodeo, he wants to be with a proven quarterback and offense. I'd love to have him. Need more vet presence next to Colston."
Saints,32lkzs,zeeyellowdart,8,Tue Apr 14 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"Not bad, have Colston move inside and take the Jimmy G routes like he used to and move Jennings out wide, I like it!"

Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,4,Tue Apr 14 21:40:10 2015 UTC,"If Winston, Mariota, Fowler, Williams, and Cooper go in the top five, I think we could trade up to six and take him without losing both first rounders. As long as we get in front of the falcons we have a shot. Lot of ""ifs"" though."
Saints,32lzsd,whodat951,3,Tue Apr 14 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be terribly opposed if we could get him for #13 and a 3rd (maybe both 3rd's if we have to), but I'd rather not give up a 2nd. If we want an ILB in this draft, all of the talent is in round 2."
Saints,32lzsd,sfzen,-4,Wed Apr 15 08:29:55 2015 UTC,"Ahahaa im so sick of this mindset goddamn. We traded up last year and got Cooks, now we have a beast at WR. Does anyone truly miss the player we couldve gotten but didnt because of that? Who gives a shit about the players outside of the top 10 or 12 this year? Wtf are you trying to hold onto? Trade up lock Beasley down and never look back. A guy like this happens maybe every decade and our defense would be instantly ridiculous.   Loomis would be a moron not to trade up."
Saints,32lzsd,SoberJudgeJudy,9,Tue Apr 14 22:31:21 2015 UTC,"Cooks cost a third round pick. That's a big leap from multiple firsts. We're not a player away from a championship. 2 first will be better than Beasley. The person available at 13 won't be significantly worse than what Beasley is.   And Beasley isn't a once in a decade prospect. He's a once a year prospect. Last year was Clowney/Mack. The year before is was Jordan. 2012 was a down year for pass rushers, but 2011 had Von Miller, Darius and Aldon Smith."
Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:55:18 2015 UTC,"Mark my words, Beasley will be an all time great.  Our defense would be  Byrd Vaccaro Lewis Browner and then this guy hurrying the quarterback. Rickey Jackson anyone? The dome patrol could only dream about a secondary like that. We're not a player away but we damn sure dont need 5 picks of mediocre either. We have a good enough offense with plenty of receivers. We could use a guard but damn man, our defense would be sick as fuck and be a turnover machine. Our biggest hole is the one Beasley would fill. I dont get the reluctance."
Saints,32lzsd,SoberJudgeJudy,7,Tue Apr 14 23:37:51 2015 UTC,Who said the 5 picks would be mediocre?   And Beasley has yet to play a single down in the NFL and you're claiming he's going to the hall of fame. Wow.
Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Apr 14 23:43:28 2015 UTC,He never said hall of fame. Sometimes you have a strong feeling about a guy. It's not the end of the world man.

Saints,32lzsd,sfzen,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:29:29 2015 UTC,"To be fair, our past 5 years or so have been pretty mediocre after the early rounds. Graham and Stills are the only real exceptions. Half of the guys we draft after round 2 don't even make the roster a couple of years later."
Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:26:07 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you're expecting out of the draft.
Saints,32lzsd,sfzen,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:58:02 2015 UTC,Some mix of excitement and disappointment. Just like every year.
Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"We're doing no better or worse than any other veteran team in the draft. In the past 5 years we've found Graham, Jordan, Ingram, Hicks, Vaccaro, Armstead, Jenkins, Stills, and Cooks in the draft. Nine starters in 5 years is pretty good especially when you consider that we had two second round picks taken from us in Bounty Gate.   Compare it to another Veteran team like Green Bay"
Saints,32lzsd,sfzen,2,Wed Apr 15 16:33:51 2015 UTC,"I don't mean just starters, I mean players after round 2 in general.  2014: SJB (2) hasn't done anything, but it's too soon to give up on him. Fortt (4) was cut. Sunseri (5) looks alright, but was injured most of last season. Powell (5) hasn't done anything yet, same as SJB. Rooks (6) is on the practice squad I think.  2013: Easily our best draft in recent years. Only Johnson was cut.  2012: Hicks (3) is good, Toon (4) took 3 years to show us anything, White (5) never panned out and was just cut, Tiller (6) and Jones (7) were both cut and never really contributed.  2011: Wilson (3), Patrick (3), Romeus (7), and Bussey (7) were all cut with no real contribution. That's everyone after round 1.  2010: Graham was the only pick in the draft that amounted to anything. Robinson (1) sucked, Brown (2) sucked, Woods (4) never made the roster IIRC, nor did Canfield (7), and Tennant (5) never did anything.  Not including the few 1st/2nd rounders I mentioned and Sunseri/Powell/Toon who the jury are still out on, out of 18 players, only 5 (Armstead, Jenkins, Stills, Hicks, and Graham) have worked out well, and 3 of those 5 were in the same year. I'll even throw in Corey White to the alright list. So that's 6 out of 18 who managed to at least be serviceable backups. Almost everyone else was cut within two years. I'm not expecting to grab future stars in the mid-late rounds, I just want to spend mid-round picks on guys who will at least be on the roster for more than a season or two.  Khairi Fortt is the one player I was truly, legitimately upset that we drafted, from the moment we drafted him. I wanted Christian Jones so bad (who, by the way, went undrafted, and we still didn't sign him, and he did alright with Chicago) and we took the super-raw, injury-plagued project LB in the 4th round over a lot of better options. My jimmies were fucking rustled."
Saints,32lzsd,SoberJudgeJudy,-1,Wed Apr 15 21:43:49 2015 UTC,Right. Because that's what you do leading up to a draft. Its called speculation.
Saints,32lzsd,Saints2Death,6,Tue Apr 14 23:51:07 2015 UTC,That level of speculation is insanity.

Saints,32lzsd,SoberJudgeJudy,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:22:41 2015 UTC,"You realize we had the #31 ranked defense in the league last year, right? We've got a lot of holes to fill, and we're in a good situation with 2 first rounders. I'd love to get Beasley as much as the next guy, but I don't want to give up another 1st round pick to take him. We moved up with a 3rd rounder to get Cooks, but it would take more than that for Beasley. We need to get talent in multiple positions a lot more than we need to invest in one star. That's kind of the theme of this whole offseason."
Saints,32lzsd,sfzen,0,Wed Apr 15 08:24:27 2015 UTC,We're not going to get talent in multiple positions by drafting a bunch of question marks. Pretty sure that what we've been doing through free agency. The talent level in the draft is a sheer drop off after midway through the first round. Why not come away with someone who atleast can be the catalyst to a highly productive defense right off the bat? There is no bigger hole than LB right now.
Saints,32lzsd,lossaysswag,2,Wed Apr 15 10:19:04 2015 UTC,"Because we need talent as pass rusher, OG, ILB, WR, and D-line, which happen to be very deep positions in this draft. And if you haven't noticed, almost all of the recent Super Bowl winners and teams that are consistently successful and not in salary cap hell build through the draft. They trade down, not up."
Saints,32lzsd,VegasSaint9,2,Wed Apr 15 14:51:24 2015 UTC,"TIL a 13th and 31st are question marks.  Where did we get Ingram again?  Vaccaro was a 15th pick and you're touting him as a member of a dream secondary despite his performance last season.  I mean, let's not even start talking about the kinds of players that went out of the top 10 the last 3 seasons.  Not to mention that Brandin Cooks, Clinton-Dix, CJ Mosley, Zack Martin, Kelvin Benjamin, Jordan Matthews, Jeremy Hill, and Jarvis Landry were all taken after ""midway through the first"" and had excellent rookie years, some even better than top 10 guys."
Saints,32lzsd,lossaysswag,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:54:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair CJ Mosely was the highest rated prospect at ILB last year and he went at 17, so was Clinton dix at FS and he went mid 20s. Those guys were good enough to go top 10 if positions werent based on some sort of draft position value. WR is super deep, but a guy like Amari Cooper could end up being better than all those guys. I wouldn't mind a trade up, but i would like to keep that 31st pick. If we trade up from 13 and down from 31 i think we can even it out. Get who we want, plus have a good amount of picks."
Saints,32lzsd,VegasSaint9,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"But that's the point... you can't unequivocally say there is a drastic drop in talent midway through the first round.  Other teams' needs play into who goes where and we don't need a first round DB, QB, or receiver so that will play into our decision to trade up or stay with some of the teams ahead of us having glaring needs for those positions and top prospects projected to go then."
Saints,32lzsd,ohhgod,1 point,Thu Apr 16 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"All I know is many teams need edge rushers, and we are one of them. The Mosely's and Clinton-Dix of this draft at OLB will go early, and the ILBs will go late. Along with Gaurds and WRs. I think if we can hit 2/3 at  OLB/ILB/DT on defense we'll be alright. Then on offense we just need a Gaurd/Tackle/WR on offense."
Saints,32lzsd,makeplayz,2,Thu Apr 16 02:43:42 2015 UTC,That's pretty good...

Saints,32kalt,dean815,14,Tue Apr 14 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"I believe the new rules about contact has really negated the need for a big number 1 receiver. Being small and shifty actually becomes more important than being big when the defenders aren't allowed to bump you nearly as much. I believe smaller guys will trend towards being the number 1 (with the outliers of the huge guys who are also blazing fast and quick), and the large receivers will become the specialists, instead of the other way around."
Saints,32kalt,Lokipokie504,5,Tue Apr 14 14:42:20 2015 UTC,that's a really good point.
Saints,32kalt,thebearcredentials,2,Tue Apr 14 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Realizing it's a good point, is also a good point."

Saints,32kalt,Jaime-Foxx,12,Thu Apr 16 03:17:49 2015 UTC,The size and weight combined with the fact that he's been picking Antonio Brown's brain this off-season... let's just say I'm not worried. This kid is a beast and will be a great Saints player for years to come.
Saints,32kalt,jffm114,7,Tue Apr 14 14:19:07 2015 UTC,The draft will answer our questions. If we get a guy like Dorsett then we know management thinks that Coleman and Toon are ready to step up. If we grab Strong or DGB then we have our possession guy
Saints,32kalt,sfzen,6,Tue Apr 14 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Strong is there at 31, I'm not even worried about what type of WR we need, he's an easy value pick and probably BPA on overall."
Saints,32kalt,jakeleo90,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think it's really interesting how there's two obvious groups of receiver on the list- the small, shifty, under 200lb/6ft guys who get behind a defense and the sturdy reliable possession receivers over 220lb and 6 feet.  Having said that, Cooks definitely has a potential to be one of the better quick receivers in the league. He was outrunning corners frequently last season and had reliable hands.. I can only remember 1 bad drop from him last season. If he can keep his speed and his injury doesn't affect his catching too much I think he'll hit 1200 yards next year.  continues sipping kool-aid"
Saints,32kalt,Hedgery,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:24:42 2015 UTC,Cooks is 5'10''? He definitely looks a lot shorter out there. I could be wrong though.

Saints,32kalt,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah haha, maybe he just looks shorter than that I guess. Not going to question the NFL's data haha"
Saints,32kalt,sfzen,0,Wed Apr 15 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"We still have Brandon Coleman on our roster who was drafted to be Marques Colston's predecessor. He's 6'6"" 225. I think we're gonna see more of him this year. I could see us drafting a stud WR at 75 or 78, assuming one is still there since this draft is uber deep at WR, to give competition to the others during training camp and to have a guy in case Toon or Coleman sucks incredible ass.  But yeah you're right. Brandin Cooks has the potential to be a No. 1 regardless of size, but our offensive scheme doesn't force us to have a No. 1 because we run so many different personnel packages that any player could be on the field at any point in a drive. It's all about mismatches with SP."
Saints,32kalt,flordeliest,5,Tue Apr 14 15:09:41 2015 UTC,"Coleman was undrafted, so there's not really much expected of him, and it's not really a huge setback if he doesn't pan out."
Saints,32kalt,makeplayz,3,Tue Apr 14 16:43:46 2015 UTC,"Its also really weird to mention him and not also mention Santavius Jones, who objectively has a better chance than Coleman."
Saints,32kalt,sfzen,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:26:42 2015 UTC,Except the dude has tremendous upside. He's just raw at the WR position. He needed to polish his route running. His highlight tapes were good tho. Dude has big play ability. He'll get a shot.  And yeah you're right he was an UDFA. That's my fuckup.
Saints,32kalt,makeplayz,6,Tue Apr 14 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"He'll definitely get a shot. The fact that we've kept him around after his less than promising display of hands last year speaks to his potential. I'm just saying that if we bring in a WR or two, he could easily land back on the practice squad."
Saints,32kalt,jakeleo90,2,Tue Apr 14 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"true. I agree mid round for WR, unless they have some inside info on one of these guys at the bottom first/mid 2nd. A lot of people had no idea OBJ would do what he did.  Edit: haven't heard much about Coleman - any chance he puts on some weight and steps into that Jimmy Graham ""hybrid"" role? Exact same 40 time, an inch shorter. If he could put on 15 lbs or so he would be Jimmy Graham light"
Saints,32l61y,Saints2Death,7,Tue Apr 14 17:51:01 2015 UTC,"So, some defenders come off board and we trade up to get who is left? That seems kinda off. Wouldn't we trade up if they're still on the board?   Also, why would this guy have insider info, and wtf is he giving it out this early?"
Saints,32l61y,brokenearth02,3,Tue Apr 14 18:02:28 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it as ""we are high on an offensive player, but we need defensive guys.. but if they're gone, then why not?"""
Saints,32l61y,DiNovi,6,Tue Apr 14 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Let's say there's three defenders we're targeting. When two of them get drafted, we trade up. Not saying that's what I want, but that's the impression I'm getting.   And I'm not sure if this is insider info or not. But Bill Polian is not like other analysts. He's highly respected by every team's inner circle, especially after it was announced he's going into the Hall of Fame. If there's one person who has insider info from the very top, it would be Polian."
Saints,32l61y,brokenearth02,5,Tue Apr 14 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but why would he share this info? Wouldn't this be breaking that trust? All well, it is what it is."
Saints,32l61y,lossaysswag,4,Tue Apr 14 18:16:43 2015 UTC,"This is a can of worms that will take too long to get into. I don't think anyone is giving Polian any information they wouldn't want leaked, so the question should be if it is insider info, why did the Saints leak it?"
Saints,32l61y,VegasSaint9,5,Tue Apr 14 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"When you put it that way seems like we're just trying to game other teams.  ""Oh no, two top edge rushers are off the board and the Saints might trade up, let's trade up to get this defender leaving x top pick to fall even farther."""
Saints,32l61y,makeplayz,5,Tue Apr 14 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so the question is who are we trading up for, how far, and how much are we going to spend to get there? I'm thinking they're really high on Fowler/Beasley/Cooper/Shelton and are going to trade the 13/31 and a 3rd for whichever pick."
Saints,32l61y,VegasSaint9,7,Tue Apr 14 17:53:41 2015 UTC,Well since it says defender you can scratch Cooper

Saints,32l61y,sophandros,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:10:47 2015 UTC,The draft never turns out how everyone expects but it appears to be certain that we will be trading up.
Saints,32l61y,Megawatts19,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:19:50 2015 UTC,"This makes sense. You start to get a sense of urgency if you see some of your prospects being taken early. If this ends up being the case, I could see us burning some extra draft picks we acquired to get a higher spot for the guys we want."
Saints,32nfbu,Easybrees009,3,Wed Apr 15 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"Gregory or Ray and it's not close for me. If the staff feels like Gregory's issues can be controlled, then him. If they're weary, then Ray. I've found a new fondness of Shane Ray after watching his feature on ESPNs Draft Academy. I highly recommend it."
Saints,32nfbu,evtine,3,Wed Apr 15 17:26:57 2015 UTC,I think the need on OL is overstated to a large extent. Front seven needs an overhaul. Lots of WR talent in the draft.

Saints,32k6np,Killbo_Baggins,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:16:38 2015 UTC,Thank you. I've been reading through it :)
Saints,32k6np,xbaited,3,Tue Apr 14 14:18:04 2015 UTC,If you can watch the games from the last 2 seasons it would tell you a bunch. The team had VERY high expectations coming into last year with what we did in the offseason but it didn't materialize. We still are very talented but need to show that and have a small window to do it with Drew's age and our cap situation.
Saints,32k6np,IseeNekidPeople,3,Tue Apr 14 14:19:46 2015 UTC,"Our cap situation will be much more manageable after this year. I agree with everything else you said though. Also, nice flair :D"

Saints,32jp1u,ashsky,7,Tue Apr 14 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"Spencer's deal will count only $655,000 against the salary cap>    That's the important figure. League minimum leaving us with $4.44million in cap space."
Saints,32jp1u,the_dharma_bum,1 point,Tue Apr 14 09:56:27 2015 UTC,What is the space needed to sign in the draft? It's a little over 5 mil average right?
Saints,32jp1u,Mayhall,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:46:31 2015 UTC,I believe they are already deducted.
Saints,32jp1u,the_dharma_bum,2,Tue Apr 14 20:14:23 2015 UTC,"Oh? That's very good news. I knew we were on top of things finally, but I figured there was still with to do."
Saints,32jp1u,moralesupport,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:42:29 2015 UTC,They aren't already deducted.  The top 55 most expensive players on the roster count toward the cap.  So most rookies don't get much more than the league minimum.  They will either not be in the top 55 or bump someone down and take 500k off their own cap hit.
Saints,32jp1u,zeeyellowdart,4,Wed Apr 15 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Now that the numbers are out, I really feel great about this signing. I was hoping we didn't overpay. What a bargain."
Saints,32jp1u,pottersquash,3,Tue Apr 14 12:57:53 2015 UTC,Saints should just hold their own Veterans combine.
Saints,32jp1u,JPD678,3,Tue Apr 14 13:01:46 2015 UTC,ryan must like this guy as he already coached him in dallas
Saints,32jp1u,sophandros,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:03:04 2015 UTC,And Ireland drafted him. Don't discount that aspect of things...
Saints,32jp1u,Hedgery,2,Tue Apr 14 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"This is honestly a huge signing, very low risk but potentially high reward. Spencer probably won't return to the dominant pass rusher he once was, but he should still be effective, and will be definitely worth far more than the veteran minimum salary that he's been signed to. If healthy, Spencer should help to provide a solid pass rush along with Galette and Jordan, and it takes the pressure off the Saints drafting a pass rusher with the 13th pick, although obviously they should still take one in this draft at some point."
Saints,32jp1u,Big-Zoo,2,Tue Apr 14 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Low risk, high reward, solid pay, what couldn't you like about it?"

Saints,32goam,moralesupport,2,Tue Apr 14 00:35:24 2015 UTC,Awesome. Definitely gonna get his jersey to replace my #80.
Saints,32goam,TheJewsisLoose,2,Tue Apr 14 04:45:56 2015 UTC,Could be poised for an even bigger year.  He only broke his hand. Shouldn't have lost any speed. And he already was a proficient route runner for such a young dude.

Saints,32izkq,jffm114,6,Tue Apr 14 04:14:36 2015 UTC,See I don't think we take Gregory because of his marinara problem. He got popped twice in college and then at the combine. Sounds like he has no discipline and that's why we pass on him.
Saints,32izkq,colby347_1,9,Tue Apr 14 11:52:21 2015 UTC,marinara    Too much sauce huh

Saints,32izkq,colby347_1,3,Tue Apr 14 14:15:50 2015 UTC,why does it have to be a linebacker and a receiver?
Saints,32izkq,Saints2Death,2,Tue Apr 14 05:32:37 2015 UTC,"just taking a guess, I would imagine we take a pass rusher if it's available at 13, but I was just trying to simply compare character issues versus safer bets"
Saints,32izkq,Charizard_Targaryen,2,Tue Apr 14 13:21:32 2015 UTC,Option B and it's not even close.
Saints,32izkq,Brees2Graham,2,Tue Apr 14 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"The first option. However both options come with risks, just different kinds. And I'd Also want a bigger WR than Dorsett."
Saints,32izkq,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Dorsett may be kind of a reach at 31 also. Dupree is very raw as well. Just curious as to how people feel about bringing in individuals with red flags after last year's season, versus safer bets in terms of character"
Saints,32izkq,Saints2Death,3,Tue Apr 14 19:37:04 2015 UTC,"He smoked pot in college. It's not like he was out getting arrested. Gregory doesn't have character issues, he had ""in college issues."" We all smoked pot in college. Even for NCAA players, pot is a slap on the wrist. A ton of great NFL players failed multiple drug tests in college. Hell Warren Sapp failed a drug test at the combine. So did Justin Houston. Josh Gordon and Rickey Williams both passed their drug tests at the combine. It happens."
Saints,32izkq,evtine,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree that it's not a huge deal and it's very common, just unprofessional. Not the fact that he does it, but the combine is a job interview. He knew he was going to be tested, he knew when he was going to be tested. Just seems like he doesn't have his priorities in line. Not knocking him for having smoked weed before."
Saints,32g97e,ashsky,3,Mon Apr 13 15:34:15 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty important. The meeting with Gregory will very likely determine whether or not we take him at #13. The talent is obviously there, but if the coaches aren't comfortable with him off the field, they won't touch him."
Saints,32g97e,sfzen,3,Mon Apr 13 19:46:22 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd love to get randy.

Saints,32g8by,VegasSaint9,6,Mon Apr 13 15:27:32 2015 UTC,Everyone is picking defense so Ill go with Amari Cooper. Definitely a playmaker with a bright future. With a QB like Brees throwing to him he would be even more phenomenal.
Saints,32g8by,brandonie187,2,Mon Apr 13 21:40:51 2015 UTC,Either Beasley: Best pass rusher in the draft and I feel it's by quite some distance. Will be a fantastic addition to anyone who drafts him.  Or Dante Fowler Jr: His versatility would allow him to fit perfectly with our scheme which involves a lot of different looks up front and in the LBs.
Saints,32g8by,ashsky,2,Mon Apr 13 15:39:06 2015 UTC,Why those 2 and not Williams? He's better than both of them.
Saints,32g8by,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:26:15 2015 UTC,We'd have to move up to two for him and the different of what you'd have to give up between 2 & 3 is monumentally massive so I assumed we were not moving up that far. I also don't feel like it's worth trading up that far for someone who'd be used for depth :/
Saints,32g8by,ashsky,0,Mon Apr 13 16:32:11 2015 UTC,Williams doesn't provide an immediate improvement over Cam. It would be more of a luxury pick than filling an immediate need like Fowler or Beasley.
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 13 16:30:28 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that fowler had the same skill set as wulliams
Saints,32g8by,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"Williams is only playing DE, both in the 3-4 and a 4-3. Fowler could be a 4-3 DE, but his best position is 3-4 OLB.   Williams is Cam Jordan. Fowler is Galette (sort of)"
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,3,Mon Apr 13 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"Nah. More specidically Williams can play 4-3 DT and DE as well as be a 3-4 DT.  Fowler fits only as Sam OLBs in our defense, but a damn good one. I don't think he is skilled enough in rushing to be a Jack OLBs like Gallette, nor do think he should. With his skill sets it would be a waste not to utilize most of is versatility by rushing him almost every down."
Saints,32g8by,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:08:24 2015 UTC,Except that William's is entirely too small to play inside on Rob Ryan's defense. And Fowler is the best standup pass rusher in the draft and is 100% skilled enough to do it.
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think you mean 3-4 DE, not DT? He'd be a 3 technique in a 4-3 or a 5 technique in a 3-4. To me this is what would make him such an asset for us since we use multiple fronts."
Saints,32g8by,dean815,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think Fowler is a more complete version of Galette. Has the tools to do what he can do, but can also do more."
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 13 17:00:03 2015 UTC,definitely. Hence the (sort of). They'd play theoretically the same position.
Saints,32g8by,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:33:08 2015 UTC,WHAT? HE would definitely rotate with Hicks at the 3-4 LDE and replace Bunk as a 4-3 RDT next to Hicks.
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,-7,Mon Apr 13 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"WHAT? Your opinion is not fact. I don't think Williams would ever play DT on our team, and he has a different skill set than what makes Hicks works on our defense. He might rotate on passing downs, but why trade up for a situational pass rusher?  You might need to spend a little more time watching the Saints play and a little less time doing your amateur draft analysis. You're ridiculously self righteous about your opinions when it comes to the draft, and it's seriously annoying."
Saints,32g8by,work_acct,8,Mon Apr 13 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"Pot, meet kettle."
Saints,32g8by,ashsky,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"Alright so between those two: lets say they're both available and somehow we have the 3rd-5th pick, who would you take?"
Saints,32g8by,Saints2Death,2,Mon Apr 13 15:55:20 2015 UTC,"That's really darn hard to answer. I will say Beasley because he has all the size, ability and moves to do anything or everything asked of him. He definitely has the ceiling of an All-Pro player and a much higher floor than Fowler."

We need to address too much in this draft to start trading our depth picks. We're not 1 player away from the Super Bowl. I'm sorry, but we're not."
Saints,32g8by,nixonator1,0,Mon Apr 13 16:25:47 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, its a hypothetical, not what I want to happen. I'd actually like to trade back with both of our first round picks if possible. From 13 to 20s and the 31st- early second round pick."

Saints,32fe9d,dean815,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"I think top 10 players falling depends entirely on Mariota, Waynes, and Parker. If they go in the top 12, we should be set to take a top talent at 13. If not, we're sort of in that no-man's-land where anything we do would be a reach."
Saints,32fe9d,sfzen,2,Mon Apr 13 17:33:37 2015 UTC,I think it entirely depends who's on the board at that spot. Don't see us trading out of the top 20 though. I think since we already have so many picks the FO will want to get the biggest impact player available at 13 and more likely to trade down with the 31st.

Guy's just tough, and he can run, block, and catch extremely well. Only problem is he's basically too good at being a Fullback to get any notice."

Saints,32cnld,hayabusarocks,18,Sun Apr 12 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"I see it like this. I'm not going to deny the whole bounty scandal or anything, I really don't know enough to argue one way or another that it happened or not. But I don't see why people think it made us play better. We knew Favre's ankle was hurt going into it. Any team in the league, bounties or not, is going to take advantage of an injury like that. EVERY DEFENSE ON EVERY TEAM WANTS TO HIT THE QB AS HARD AND AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE. The fact that our players may have been offered money to hit Favre harder and abuse that ankle doesn't make us play any better.  It's not like an extra couple thousand dollars of incentive is going to suddenly make a player better, or make a team Super Bowl Champion caliber.  It's a scandal, and one that deserved to be punished assuming it was true, but I consider cheating to be gaining an unfair advantage to win games (such as PED's, bribing opponents to lose intentionally, stealing private gameplan/playbook/whatever information from the opponents), and in that sense, the bounty thing isn't cheating. It's wrong, sure, but not something that affects how well we played.  For comparison: pumping in fake crowd noise, in my opinion, has a much bigger impact on the field than bounties. The bounties were definitely worse, and deserved more punishment IMO, but as far as affecting the final score of a game, I find it difficult to believe that ""I'll give you extra money if you hit that guy you were already trying to hit really hard"" has more of a practical effect than ""Let's play fake crowd noise really loud over the speakers when the other team's offense is on the field."""
Saints,32cnld,sfzen,6,Sun Apr 12 18:51:25 2015 UTC,"Great points and just to add a little depth; what normal person thinks that most starting football players really even care about thousands of dollars? I think it was more of a competition between team members to see who would receive the money, rather than the value of the cash. Something more relatable would be if a couple of guys at work each put $10 on a couple of female coworkers and whoever sleeps with them gets the cash. It's about bragging rights and the feeling of actually banging one of these chicks (like we banged Brett Farve)."
Saints,32cnld,SaintsComeMarchingIn,1 point,Sun Apr 12 20:18:29 2015 UTC,"The dome was extremely loud and it really affected Favre for sure but he wad hit a large amount of times and extremely hard, causing large penalties, i doubt it has an effect on the entire season, but it may have won that game for us"
Saints,32cnld,IAteTheFridge,0,Sun Apr 12 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head with this one. The main issue with bounties imo was the moral part of paying for cartings, concussions, etc. In a sport where athletes wreck their bodies it's terrible to see its coaches reward it with cash money. It crosses a line in my opinion.   But in terms of rules, it's a way of circumventing the salary cap. These were my main gripes with the bounty scandal."
Saints,32cnld,sfzen,2,Sun Apr 12 20:21:30 2015 UTC,Never even thought of the salary cap thing.
Saints,32cnld,smokeajay,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:01:03 2015 UTC,Players exchanging money isn't affecting the salary.  It is just basic shifting of money without increasing the total.  Now if the team played players for big hits that would.
Saints,32cnld,harveyfjord,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:20:02 2015 UTC,"Could we have won without bounty gate or did we even have that then?  http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrook/100126  You tell me.  From the article...  ""Saints players came after Favre so hard -- four times slamming him in ways that invited late-hit or roughing penalties, only two of which were called -- that TMQ had the impression Williams told his charges something along the lines of, ""Pound Favre every time you can; we will take a couple of roughing flags in return for making an old guy worry about the next hit."" That was what happened at the end of regulation. Game tied, Minnesota ball on the New Orleans 38, the Vikings faced third-and-15, holding a timeout. Favre rolled right and might have run for at least 5 yards, then performed a hook slide and called the timeout, setting up a 50-yard field goal attempt (the Vikes have a good kicker in Longwell). Was it Favre's hamartia that made him throw that crazy cross-field pass -- or fear that he would be hammered again?""  also some foreshadowing to 2011  ""Williams nearly blitzed New Orleans out of the Super Bowl."""
Saints,32cnld,sophandros,5,Sun Apr 12 21:36:52 2015 UTC,"This past season, Marv Lewis said that he was perfectly fine with late hit penalties when they got some flags against the Saints.  Somehow, the league didn't sanction him."
Saints,32cnld,dean815,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"Each player makes almost 100k dollars just for being on the team that wins each conference. Undoubtedly a few of the players were just using the incentive system to have fun racking up stats. Any team facing Favre would have hit him as ferociously as possible. It's not like teams were expected to ""take it easy"" on Favre or something. This is nothing new in the NFL which is why 99% of players and coaches had nothing to say about it or said it wasn't a big deal to them. Injury is an inevitability in the NFL and these guys know what they signed up for.   Furthermore, the ""bounty system"" as described by the media and Goodell is entirely questionable. The only person who ever admitted to any specific wrongdoing was Gregg Williams after he was cut by the team and suspended indefinitely, no doubt looking to save face and have another shot in the NFL.   In 2012, Vilma and other players appeared in front of a federal court to argue the punishments and while their case was largely considered vaild, the issue was that Goodell does generally hold jurisdiction over outside parties in these matters."
Saints,32cnld,quantumhed,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what team you're on, any defender that regularly brutalizes his opponents will be rewarded with millions of dollars in his next contract. So the notion that a $1,500 prize motivates players to hunt each other, but a $30 million dollar contract does not, is extremely silly.   In my view. The league was facing down the barrel in the head injury scandal. It wasn't gonna be long before the media ran with it and congress started having hearings. I think the league decided to do something proactive before it got bad. And a small market team presents the easiest target to make an example of,  because the financial consequences of alienating an entire fan base is minimal if done to a small franchise."
Saints,328zni,ashsky,2,Sat Apr 11 17:42:47 2015 UTC,Posted this because what I found interesting was that we have not hosted Trae Waynes/are not looking to host him. Visits are pretty indicative of the players the team is considering and the fact he is not being hosted interested me. Especially with approximately half of mock drafts saying we should take him at 13 (albeit mocks are normally wrong as we all know).  We also didn't meet with him at Pro day (if MSU have had theirs? or the draft or even any workouts.)
Saints,328zni,Saints2Death,3,Sat Apr 11 17:45:26 2015 UTC,I think the mocks are going to be amazingly wrong this year. I think Waynes is going to end up in the Top 10

But I think you're overlooking the need at WR. And with Parker, it's not that we ""need"" him, but what SP and Drew could do with a guy like that. If the top pass rushers are gone I think we should go with him. I'd even take him over Dupree, but that may be the Louisville fan in me. I just feel that we'd get more out of him. Imagine our offense with an AJ green type player in it and how much it could open up the field for Cooks/Ingram/Spiller?"
Saints,327pv7,evtine,2,Sun Apr 12 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"I would agree, except the LB and pass rusher talent is so top heavy this year.

Saints,3250ns,Fallen_Milkman,13,Fri Apr 10 17:23:59 2015 UTC,"Posted this for the Saint fan who asked about him in /r/cowboys   He wasn't the same after the injury. However, he had a full year+ a few games before he was back in the lineup as a rotational guy. At the end of the season he was really starting to return to form. He still wasn't the same guy as before the injury but he wasn't someone you ignore.  With another offseason to heal and workout plus camp, I think he will still be a solid DE. He has lost a step but I think you'll see good production out of him if he stays healthy."

If Cornerback talent drops, I can see Green Bay taking that instead but I'm not too sure. I think 31st would be a great pick and the 2nd round would be an absolute steal but I am not sure if he'll make it to either pick so we may have to settle for a different ILB.   We shall see!"

Saints,322rkd,sfzen,-1,Fri Apr 10 03:40:43 2015 UTC,yeah he could teach him how to be a good CB but i really hate shermans attitude so he better stays away from him.
Saints,322rkd,hrafnass,6,Fri Apr 10 09:30:51 2015 UTC,There is absolutely nothing wrong with Sherman's attitude.  He was a late round pick who thus has a chip on his shoulder. He works hard and aims to be the best at his position. He uses both his physical ability and on field psychology to be better than his opponents.
Saints,322rkd,sophandros,7,Fri Apr 10 12:21:47 2015 UTC,Yep. Dude has gotten into the entire league's head to where he takes away 1/3rd of the field.

Saints,322rkd,Hedgery,2,Sat Apr 11 01:15:31 2015 UTC,in the dog house.   Sounds a bit harsh. Was he actually in trouble all year? Or were they holding him out to develop him?
Saints,322rkd,makeplayz,7,Fri Apr 10 05:06:42 2015 UTC,Development
Saints,322rkd,CKitch26,2,Fri Apr 10 06:37:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I felt they were doing the same thing to him as they did with Armstead the year prior. Payton probably had no plans on playing Armstead as a rookie until Brown started playing absolutely terribly at LT and Armstead probably started showing that he was developing well and ready to play, so they threw him in. With SJB, they probably had no plans on playing him last year, and even when they were having troubles at CB they knew better to throw an rookie who isn't ready yet in against NFL WRs. Hoping he shows some improvement this year and gets some snaps, as they'll have some competition at the nickel corner spot and hopefully he earns some playing time."
Saints,320u49,atn420,29,Thu Apr 9 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Wait, does that guy not know about the #firesale?"
Saints,320u49,Saints2Death,16,Thu Apr 9 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, when our opposition is the Bucs, Panthers, and Falcons, it's not that difficult. We had obvious holes to fill, and we filled a few of them."
Saints,320u49,sfzen,6,Thu Apr 9 19:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think y'all will be surprised with the Falcons this year. Dan Quinn and Kyle Shannahan are setting us up to play much more straightforward football with a focus on balance and better fundamentals. We also have gotten a lot of high-ceiling depth and we're set up for Quinn to get a nice defensive piece in the draft.  That being said, I do think the Saints made some interesting and seemingly smart moves. I think you'll do fine without Jimmy. Brees not being pressured > Jimmy Graham on the field. I also think that getting rid of people with contracts in return for draft picks (which equals less of a cap space problem) was a great move. If it all pans out is a different story."
Saints,320u49,SpaceSick,11,Thu Apr 9 21:14:20 2015 UTC,"the thing about Jimmy is he was kind of a double-edged sword for Brees. He was a fantastic redzone target, but Brees would rely on him way too much, and half of his interceptions were from trying to force the ball to Graham when he should have just gotten rid of it."
Saints,320u49,sfzen,4,Thu Apr 9 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"As fantastic of an athlete Jimmy is, I really think Brees could do well with just about any receiver. I think the team will get more from him having a better O-line"
Saints,320u49,SpaceSick,3,Thu Apr 9 22:25:21 2015 UTC,He does make Meachem a viable #3 WR...
Saints,320u49,sfzen,6,Thu Apr 9 22:33:39 2015 UTC,Which does give another opportunity for an old fashioned Meecharound
Saints,320u49,psquared85,4,Fri Apr 10 05:58:37 2015 UTC,"Besides the coaching changes the Falcons are pretty much the same team, minus a draft pick."
Saints,320u49,flordeliest,5,Thu Apr 9 21:51:09 2015 UTC,"We picked up a few nice pieces (no one super amazing) and we don't lose our draft pick until next year. The coaching changes are really what's going to be important. Using the guys we have to their strengths instead of putting them in a system that they can't succeed it (at least on defense). But we did get a better TE and I think they guy got we got from the Cowboys will be good.   Not to say you guys haven't made better moves so far, at least on paper. Amazed at the magic Loomis did on the salary cap too."
Saints,320u49,kraken-on-standby,4,Thu Apr 9 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually think the coaching change is a bigger deal for y'all then most other teams that have a coaching change.  Mike Smith was REALLY holding the team back."

Saints,322k53,Bigheadparker,5,Fri Apr 10 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"I agree about weed being a stupid thing to test for and all that. But the fact that the dude couldn't quit smoking pot for a month, or find a way to pass the test, concerns me about his self control off the field.   You knew you had a drug test, on that's essentially worth millions of dollars, and you failed to? Just makes me wonder."
Saints,322k53,sfzen,5,Fri Apr 10 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He knew they would be testing for it. He knew when they would be testing for it. He knew that he was arguably a top 5 pick, and he knew that a failed drug test could (and most likely will) cost him millions. And he couldn't stop long enough to pass the test.  Statistics show that, with regular use, the THC will stop showing up positive in a urine test (which I'm assuming is what the Combine does) in a week or two. Only in ""extreme cases"" is it detected after a couple of months (source). Unless this kid spends all of time with Snoop Dogg, he would only have had to give it up for a month or so.  I get that the whole process is stressful. I get that weed helps people calm down and eases pain and can be legitimate medicine. But it's one month, for millions of dollars. It's not like quitting heroin cold turkey."

Saints,3206gc,Saints2Death,3,Thu Apr 9 15:22:29 2015 UTC,This is the only logical answer.
Saints,3206gc,makeplayz,2,Thu Apr 9 16:08:58 2015 UTC,"We have 8 picks this year. 13, 31, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd, 5th, 5th, 6th, 7th. Payton likes to move up to get his guy, and I don't know the last time we actually made 7 picks. I fully expect us to trade up at some point in the first 4 rounds, I just don't know where.  I don't really see us trading down, unless it's to recoup some picks after trading up."
Saints,3206gc,sfzen,3,Thu Apr 9 15:46:24 2015 UTC,We have 9 picks.

Saints,3206gc,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'd have no problem with that, but might prefer the 2nd next year so we have an extra pick in another draft as well as this one. Since the fall off is so great after the first handful of draft picks in this years draft (and we are likely outside the window for the top players) we wouldn't lose much doing this."
Saints,3206gc,backgrinder,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"We could trade this years second for next and a 4/5 or something like that. I'd like to keep the 31st though because we can also trade back with that as well. If I were the Saints I trade back as close to the current picks as possible that way we can get more picks this year and next while also replenishing the young talent. that would be ideal, but all signs point to trading up, so who knows."
Saints,3206gc,VegasSaint9,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:14:20 2015 UTC,"The question mark here was do the Browns have enough with the 12 and 19 picks to move up enough.    A 12 and 13 might be the ammo they need to move up, while we would only move back a few spots."
Saints,3206gc,twags88,0,Fri Apr 10 11:48:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see the Brown's trading back to 13 for a player they can take at 12.  It makes no sense.  If they want to trade up, redskins offer the best spot if mariota falls past ten."
Saints,31zy3r,jesusjwatt,7,Thu Apr 9 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't a rebuilding year. We already have more picks this year in the top 80, then we have had in the last couple of years combined.   At 13 we could get Gregory, Shelton, Brown, Dupree, Ray. There is no guarantee more than maybe one of them will be available layer than 13."
Saints,31zy3r,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Cooper won't be there, but if he is I can assure you he would be ours in a heartbeat. I dont think any defender will be worth taking at 13 except maybe Danny Shelton, again if he is there. Trading from 31-16 would require probably 2 3rds or a 2nd. And again if we're retooling/rebuilding I think we need all the help we can get. If anything if there are no solid defenders at 13 i hope we trade back. The highest I would like us to move up from is 13-10 or so for Danny Shelton. Also I don't think Bud Dupree will be worth trading up after 13 anyways. If he fell past 25, maybe, but I don't think he would be that impactful as a rookie for us to do that."
Saints,31zy3r,VegasSaint9,2,Thu Apr 9 14:05:07 2015 UTC,you don't think any defender in the entire draft is worth taking at 13?
Saints,31zy3r,IseeNekidPeople,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"No. I'm saying any defender at 13 probably wont be worth taking at 13.  I'd love Dante Fowler, Beasley, Shelton, and Leonard Williams, but i doubt any of them will be there at 13. After those guys I think Eric Kendricks is the next best guy and we could trade back for him. Maybe Malcolm Brown, but again at 13? Nah, trade back. And anyone who says Gregory to the Saints is an idiot. Payton will never put up with his stupidity."
Saints,31zy3r,VegasSaint9,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:58:34 2015 UTC,"I think we are going to end up with Dupree or Gregory at 13.  Justin Houston failed a combine drug test, he's has had no more drug related issues and is an all-pro with over 18 sacks last year."
Saints,31zy3r,IseeNekidPeople,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:13:33 2015 UTC,"Houston's probably an exception. I'm not saying it can't happen, but he better get his shit together if we do. I just dont think Payton pulls the trigger on a guy he wont put up with.  I think Dupree is who we'll get if we stay at 13. However I wouldn't mind trading up from 31 to the early to mid 20s for Kendricks. I dont think he'll get past 28 or so."
Saints,31zy3r,VegasSaint9,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:19:44 2015 UTC,I think Kendricks will be there at 31.  The only real threat is Packers taking him at 30.

Saints,31x36i,makeplayz,5,Wed Apr 8 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"I just spent the past few hours defending Brees this past year. I still think he is a top tier QB. I do agree that he is declining though. I think he and SP have realized this too. JG->Unger= More protection+better run game. I hope we focus on a playstyle similar to what Dallas did. If Ingram can do even close to what Demarco did last year I will be very happy. I would be happier to see a more stout defense, but I'm beginning to think it's a pipe dream. Anyway, I agree with you. You were harsh to begin with, but it's a reality we need to come to eventually. I completely agree with the SP playcalling as well. That suspension hurt us in so many ways."
Saints,31x36i,xbaited,5,Wed Apr 8 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"Stats are a bitch because they don't tell the whole picture.  Completion percentage doesn't tell you the root cause. It is merely a symptom.   Was Brees throwing the same concept against the same coverage?  Fundamentally, what Brees is really good at is the same thing Brady, at his core, is good at. Processing a defense and distributing the ball to open grass (whoever that may be).   Since 2012, it has been a downhill progression of picking the concepts he is comfortable with (Low hanging fruit).  When you have a 6'7"" monster body in the seam, you get away from short 3 step passes, quick screens, and slow screens. More and more each season it was forcing it to #80 downfield deeper, and deeper. 7-step patterns or play-action that become boom or bust. Brees has never been a big downfield thrower. He took targets after they worked the quick game and tempo, but since 2012 it has increasingly relied on going for big explosive plays. problem is, that increased incompletions and lead to sputtered drives.  If they get back to what they did in 2006-2009, Brees has another 3-4 good years left."
Saints,31x36i,swamptech,3,Wed Apr 8 22:04:40 2015 UTC,Which ball do you think you would consistently catch?  If i throw it to you from 15 yards away  or I throw it to you 60 yards down field while you are sprinting?  that is the tl;dr answer.  Get back to the quick passing game and Brees is lights out
Saints,31x36i,swamptech,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:20:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Brees doesn't have a strong arm. We dont have a good O-line. Soooooo why have we been continuing to throw deep seams and go routes, always trying for the big play? Brees isn't a big play QB anymore. He's a ""nickel and dime you to death"" QB."
Saints,31x36i,swamptech,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"I would argue the Oline isn't terrible. They don't suck  The deeper you throw the more protection you need because you're proloning the release (more sacks, more things can go wrong).  You want to send 3 receivers, a back, and a soft ""tight end"" out on a deep route? Great but you only have 5 players left to block the pass rush."
Saints,31x36i,paradigmshift7,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:47:06 2015 UTC,Except..... we don't have a good offensive line. It is half as good as 2009-2012. Our line is our offense's Achilles heel. Especially our interior line. Terron Armstead is the only o-lineman from last year's squad that is worth a damn.
Saints,31x36i,paradigmshift7,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:55:51 2015 UTC,We don't have a good o-line? How do you know that? Our o-line is looking different this year with lelito in his traditional position of guard and of course Unger. We have tight ends that will actually block. We haven't even had our draft yet. Basically neither we nor you have any idea how good our o-line is going to be.

Saints,31x36i,thebearcredentials,4,Wed Apr 8 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"There was an article recently that was posted about the interior line and Brees needing the pocket.  I mean, you can place just as much blame on the interior line as on Brees himself."
Saints,31x36i,thebearcredentials,-2,Wed Apr 8 22:02:16 2015 UTC,I too agree with this. But you just made my point for me.
Saints,31x36i,daybreaker,2,Wed Apr 8 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"No.  It is so much more complicated than statistics can lead you to believe.  Is Brees declining?  Of course he is...he will never have another 2011 season...and we will probably never have another offensive line that we had in 2011.  I'm just saying that these situational stats only makes Brees to be worse than he really is.  I'd say the declining pass protection plays just as much as a part.  Same thing will play calling, referees' calls, and the rest of the offense and defense.  Fuck, most of your situational stats can be directly contributed to declining line play (sacks, INTs).  Everybody here knows Brees' game is declining..."
Saints,31x36i,daybreaker,-1,Wed Apr 8 22:48:28 2015 UTC,"Well in that case, the blame falls on Payton's play calling and Brees' lack of checking down or audibling to something that gets the ball out quicker. If you have a shit o-line you have to get the ball out faster, just like with a rookie QB you lean on the running game, just like when you have a shit defense you can control the clock to limit their time on the field, limiting their mistakes. There's ways around things.  In my honest opinion, I truly believe Brees and Payton were content with the one Super Bowl. It seems like they've just been chasing stats to cement their legacy as an offensive duo. Brees is gonna move into third on the career TD list. Stats are cool, but the only time I care about them is when I play franchises in Madden. To me, Super Bowls define your legacy, not stats. If Brees and Payton are chasing stats over rings then I'll disappointed.  However, if they really want to cement their legacy, especially Sean Payton, they need to prove that we can get a 2,000 yard rusher. Ingram had the heart for it and a 2,000 yard rusher is an accomplishment the entire team feels a part of. Especially offensive linemen. For them to do what they've done with the passing game and then pull a 180 and ground and pound a 2,000 yard rusher would put Payton and Brees up there as one of the greatest coach and QB combo. Especially if it got them another ring."
Saints,31x36i,daybreaker,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:19:05 2015 UTC,I don't even think you need a 2k rusher.  You just have to have a legit threat and strong screen game for Brees which means you need a good interior line and a TE that can actually block.  I loved Jimmy Graham and know he'll be a force on Seattle but seriously he was not great for The Saints.  Wilson lives on scrambling around until a guy can get open.  Brees was getting killed on it.
Saints,31x36i,ToddNew,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:14:39 2015 UTC,"Brees is not declining. As mentioned, stats don't explain the context of each stat. It doesn't show you why an incomplete pass may have been caused by a bad route, or good coverage, etc."
Saints,31x36i,ToddNew,0,Thu Apr 9 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"By your logic, Completions yards and TDs dont give the true context of the play. Like how great the adjustment to make the catch was, the DB tripped, blah blah blah.   Stop apologizing for Brees. He CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I mean, he is a human being, he does make mistakes, he is not a God. It seems Saints fans lack a distinction between the two.  Brees = God"
Saints,31x36i,ToddNew,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"And my logic would stand because TDs don't give a full accounting either. A receiver can score a touchdown simply because the defender slipped down etc.    I'm not saying Brees is above reproach, or that he is perfect. But you are insane to think he is falling off and turning into some pitiful QB. Brees is an ELITE QB.  Not everything he throws is a manifestation of divinity, but he is still an amazing QB with incredible accuracy, he is smart, he is a play maker, he can put the ball in tight spots, throws an incredible screen, and has TONS of singular stats and records that far outweigh any negative stats he may have.    So for now...WHO DAT! In Breesus name,   Amen"
Saints,31wpmq,MistaChopstix,6,Wed Apr 8 19:21:33 2015 UTC,"If I can only choose between those two, it's Bud Dupree.

I put corner over receiver and guard because I don't trust any of our corners outside of Lewis and Browner.  All it would take is one injury and we are back to having only one corner, last year we had that problem and it was a nightmare.  A big question mark for this draft is which, if any, of the available corners are polished enough to be ready to play if Browner/Lewis go down."
Saints,31whxu,VegasSaint9,3,Wed Apr 8 19:03:50 2015 UTC,Thank god someone will admit we need a corner
Saints,31whxu,flordeliest,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:08:22 2015 UTC,I think this idea just allows us to make a logical BPA strategy as long as you don't priorities the needs. Come up with the five biggest needs that should be addressed with the first five picks and set up a big board with these positions and divide the big board in 5 tiers per pick value.

We need more help on defense than on offense - even with losing Graham.

Doesn't really matter we need lineman for the future.  A DT to back-up Jordan and Hicks, Foster is the only depth behind both of them.  Everything else is meh late round stuff.  WR? Sure, Bress can turn any one with great hands into a star, we teach them how to run routes later.  CB you say? Better be a fast one I worry about getting burned on deep balls.  Another LB?

Throw in some packages designed around Spiller/Cooks/Morgan and this offense could be the NFL's most exciting unit to watch.

Saints,31vzji,omnitien,10,Wed Apr 8 21:27:13 2015 UTC,Absolutely 100% NEITHER!!! We don't need a QB to groom. Aaron Rodgers is the only QB that this method has ever worked in the past 30 years. We also have a ton of depth concerns at other positions that would be better to address higher in the draft. We don't have the luxury of selecting someone high in the draft that will contribute nothing in the next two seasons.
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but isn't every QB drafted to eventually become a starter? You should always try to have a backup that's ready to go should the starting QB go down. If that QB isn't great, then teams have to spend a high pick on a QB once their starter retires or gets traded. There's no harm in trying to get a quality QB for the future, bc nobody knows what the future holds for any player."
Saints,31vzji,Charizard_Targaryen,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is that if you wait until your QB is gone to find a future replacement for an older QB, you have to rely on getting lucky immediately. Every year would just be ""I hope we hit on a QB"" and then you have to give a guy 3 years just so see if maybe he can turn into the guy, and if he doesnt you have to try again. Then head coaches jobs are on the line waiting for these guys."
Saints,31vzji,hMJem,2,Thu Apr 9 01:07:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, A-Rod did spend 2 years behind Favre, but Brady, Brees, Romo, Rivers, and I assume other prevalent QBs spent time learning behind an incumbent in the beginning of their careers too."
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,5,Wed Apr 8 16:49:13 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of QBs above the Dalton line started some point in their rookie season, and with the new CBA, it will be detrimental to draft a QB and waste years of their rookie contract.   Brady, Brees and Rivers spent 1 year on the bench. If we draft a QB this year, he'll be sitting a minimum of two years and that's us letting Brees walk away in 2017, which isn't going to happen."
Saints,31vzji,whodatsip,2,Wed Apr 8 16:56:55 2015 UTC,"Critics of Petty's game say he's benefited too much from Baylor's spread offensive, which requires 2 reads usually. Obviously this doesn't transition well to the NFL. He'd benefit tremendously from learning the Saints system behind Brees."
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,4,Wed Apr 8 17:21:33 2015 UTC,I'd rather we not draft Petty at all then hope he learns how to read defenses by holding a clipboard for Brees for 2-4 years.
Saints,31vzji,makeplayz,2,Wed Apr 8 17:23:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I dont want a QB this draft. But if Brees shows an immense decline in 2015, we're screwed."
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 8 17:28:41 2015 UTC,"There's so many ""ifs"" this season that would screw us with Brees declining being least of our worries."
Saints,31vzji,whodatsip,0,Wed Apr 8 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"We've got 9 picks this draft... why not use one for a future QB? If Brees declines, we're completely screwed. Petty is a good contingency plan but must be developed."
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,6,Wed Apr 8 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"Here's what we need to address before back up QB:  Inside Linebacker: Hawthorne is a major downgrade from Lofton and Ellerbe is an injury risk. We must draft a starter here, so this will take one of our top 5 picks.  Outside Linebacker: Haralson is the weakest point in our front 7 and has been anytime he's asked to start. We need a starter here so this is another of our top 5 picks.  Interior Lineman: Rather you think Lelito can be the starter at LG, we need a starting caliber interior linemen, which will take one of our first 5 picks. Here is why. If Unger, who missed 10 games last year, gets hurt then Lelito moves to center - where he is terrible - and we need a starting caliber guard. Evans will be 32 and is coming off surgery so it's likely he will miss time. Lelito has never been asked to start 16 games, so it's likely he'll miss time. We need someone in we can rely on either for 16 games, or spot starts because we will have injuries inside this season.   Defensive Line: We only have 3 defensive ends on our roster and two NT who both missed time last season. We need depth and upgrades here, so that's another Top 5 pick because we need at least one lineman who will get significant snaps. we'll need another defensive lineman later in this draft too since we're so shallow here.  Receiver: Our three best past catchers are Colston, who will be 32 this year and in decline, Cooks, who is coming off IR and is slightly built which makes him an injury risk, and Josh Hill, who has never started 16 games in a season. If any of these three are hurt, we're going to rely on some pretty shoddy receivers. Toon, Coleman, Jones and Morgan are all intriguing to get snaps, but as starters? We need to bring someone in who can play immediately which will probably take a top 5 pick.   Tackle: Not as big of a concern, but we're one injury away from having Bryce Harris as the starter. We have to get someone in better than him, which means middle rounds at the very least.   We need to address all these areas (which in many cases means multiple picks) before even sniffing a QB."
Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,4,Wed Apr 8 18:18:02 2015 UTC,Because there's more than 9 holes we need to fix this draft and a back up QB is not one of these holes. And it would be a complete wasted pick to draft a QB while Brees' window is closing.

Saints,31vzji,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 8 19:14:18 2015 UTC,"Neither of those are the same situation. Brady was never planned as the heir apparent since the Patriots gave Bledsoe at the time the largest contract in NFL history the year that he got hurt and Brady took over. And Rivers was the No. 3 overall pick and that entire situation was an absolute cluster fuck with Eli and Brees.  Yes, obvious there's been QBs that have sit for a year or two before becoming the starter, but the Green Bay situation is the only case where you had a team with a franchise QB draft the heir apparent to sit a few years and have a smooth transition to another franchise QB. But these situations aren't the same at all. Green Bay was coming off back-to-back-to-back divisional titles when they drafted Rodgers, where we have had losing records two of the last three years. Rodgers was also the No. 2 QB taken and a first round pick, where as Petty and Hundley aren't near the prospect coming out."
Saints,31vzji,TheBionicShaboy,2,Wed Apr 8 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Based on what I've heard around here, people really like Bryce Petty. Personally, I don't think we should draft a quarterback this year, especially with a 3rd rounder."

Saints,31vzji,neovenator250,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:05:15 2015 UTC,Neither.  I don't think we should touch a QB in this draft.  I don't think either is actually worth a 3rd round pick to begin with. and I don't think we should take a QB for the sake of taking one when we have so many other needs.
Saints,31vzji,whodatsip,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:25:10 2015 UTC,"Bryce Petty would be a great pickup with our second 3rd round pick - if he's on the board. Brees' clock is ticking, can't beat father time. It's naive of us to think we don't need a better contingency plan at QB."

Saints,31tos5,twags88,3,Wed Apr 8 06:40:51 2015 UTC,"I do not think that we need to trade up to as high as three. Beasley is number one on my draft board (assuming Williams won't be there past two), but I think if we traded to six or seven we could keep our second (give up a third) and still get either him or someone comparable, especially with Fowler and Cooper still in play around then in this mock. Then we still have a second to get the best inside linebacker available (McKinney, Anthony, Perryman and Dawson were all still available) after taking Jordan Phillips at the end of the first. Then in the third I would have taken Miller or Havenstein to shore up our line instead of Kouandijo who I see as someone who will be out of the league in three years. Just my opinion, but I would be much happier if we came out of the draft with our first pick in the 1st being Beasley, Cooper, Fowler or someone like Gregory or Ray if the first three are gone (if we can't trade that high for just a third, Bud Dupree and Shane Ray were still available at 13), our second pick in the first being Jordan Phillips, a far better DT than Mario Edwards Jr, best ILB available of the four in the second round, and then a solid lineman instead of a bust (again just my opinion). So basically, I would do it all differently."

Saints,31s398,makeplayz,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:08:46 2015 UTC,"1) I think SJB or Breaux could battle with Kyle Wilson for the CB3 spot, unless we draft a really nice CB in Peters, Johnson, Collins, or Darby. I honestly don't think Wilson should have the spot seeing what he's done in NY  2) I think Stephone Anthony could compete with Hawthorne for the MLB spot.   3) I don't think the Guard we draft will start because the reason for the Unger trade was so Lelito could move to the guard position. BUT PLEASE. PLEEEEEEAASE KEEP BRYCE HARRIS AS FAR AWAY FROM THE STARTING POSITION AS POSSIBLE"

Saints,31s398,Breesus-Walks,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"Well it's impossible to know who our brass has their eye on. As critical as I am of Brees, I don't know if our future is in this draft. It was in the 2011 draft, when I was pleading for Russell Wilson.  With that said, we have 9 picks, we have no depth in our defensive front 7. Akiem Hicks faltered last year and I had such high expectations for him last year, and apparently a lot of people did. We have no interior penetration whatsoever. It's pathetic. Bunkley should've been gone, Jenkins needs to get a swift kick to the ass to get motivated or pissed off. We need a Big DT that plays with a high motor that can cause even a little havoc in the middle to anchor our 3-4 on running downs. If we get our big guy, he'd obviously be able to play DT in a 4-3 and goal line situations. With the 148/154 picks, we could get a 3-4 DE to challenge Hicks.  We need an edge rusher opposite Junior and Cam that can draw a little attention away from Junior, and essentially help Hicks. A guy that we can move around and get creative with (Im sure everyone knows this and feels this way). We also need a stud MLB that will be our defensive leader for the next decade. I would've rather kept Lofton to be our run stuffer while putting a rookie next to him that's just an athletic freak that makes plays to compliment each other, but we have Ellerbee, so...  We need a CB to learn from Browner and Lewis, because we dont know what we have in SJB, Dixon got arrested and we still dont truly know what we have in him. Jets fans are laughing at us for signing Kyle Wilson, so maybe that can turn out better than they think and we're hoping for. Who knows. Obviously if 1st round talent CBs are gone we shouldnt reach for a CB at 31, but assuming a top prospect is available we should go with CB at 31.   I have faith in Lelito at G, he just wasnt a very good center. We need to get a young guy in there, either 3rd or 5th round, that can compete with Lelito and possibly be Evans' replacement.  Now, I wont be mad if we Take Cooper in the 1st, even tho I feel we shouldnt, or Phillip Dorsett in the 2nd or 3rd. I have a friend who's a huge Miami Hurricanes/Philadelphia Eagles fan and he raves about Dorsett. He wants Philly to land him but he also wants us to get him if Philly doesnt .But I'd much rather bring a WR in later, if we even draft one."

Saints,31s398,SoUnderrated,2,Tue Apr 7 20:53:54 2015 UTC,Me too. I hope that the reason he was behind Edebali on the depth chart as a edge rusher is because we have plans of using him at Haralson's position and he still needed a little work.
Saints,31s398,aimerj,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"Outside of the secondary, Jesus Christ our depth is absolutely shocking. If someone goes down we are absolutely fucked and seeing as Ellerbe + Bunkley have a high injury chance, I expect it to happen somehow.  We definitely need to bolster the front 7 more than absolutely anything. Our linebacker corps is god awful and more than absolutely anything we need to bolster it. An ILB/MLB is 100% must, Hawthorne and Ellerbe sounds like one of the worst pairs in the league. Haralson shouldn't be anywhere near starting, he is so damn bad leaving OLB as an essential also.  The good thing with WR is there will be talent in the mid rounds/3rd-ish where we could find a decent WR3/2 depending on what we do with Cooks although, they could never be a 1.  Looking at the roster as a whole, we have no depth anywhere. Absolutely none except Safety and possibly CB. OLB starter needed. ILB starter needed. OG/OT starter needed. WR potential starter needed. And that is only the starter positions we may require...  DT depth needed. DE depth needed.  Oh boy... sobs  Quick edit: I think we go defense 1st round no matter what unless somebody drops. The only WR I personally would be happy with at 13 is Amari. The guy will light up the league."
Saints,31s398,aimerj,2,Wed Apr 8 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a strict BPA guy, especially high in the draft and I can see the argument that Collins or Scherff could be BPA at 13. Drafting one of them won't be a sexy pick, but both can be immediate starters inside and eventually replace Strief at RT. If you're looking at depth concerns, our center missed 10 games last year, RG had surgery on his wrist and is on the wrong side of 30, and our LG has never played a full season before. Also, if the oft injuried center goes down, our starting LG is the backup center and is terrible at it. So one injury means two backups in the middle of our line."
Saints,31s398,aimerj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"Re-reading what I've put, I agree with you. If La'el or Scherff are there at 13 and we take them, it would be very understandable considering the thick of things.  Other injury concerns involve Byrd coming off his and Browner.. who has not played a full season in something like 3 years. We absolutely need to nail this draft or there'll be too many holes to cope with, kinda worrying."
Saints,31s398,aimerj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"Depth can be addressed in the draft. My concern is having too many rookies that have to start. Just on defense we need two starters at LB and could use on on the defensive line, throw in the need of a starter at guard and we're starting the season with 4 rookie starters. What team has ever done well with that many rookies starting?"
Saints,31s398,aimerj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:00:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. I can't remember a team composed of a load of rookies doing well in recent memory especially on the defensive side of the ball.  Praying that we aren't plagued by injuries otherwise things go tits up.
Saints,31s398,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:15:13 2015 UTC,I think Funchess could be a nice pick up in the draft. Especially since he could be used as a WR and TE

Saints,31p5us,SoUnderrated,6,Tue Apr 7 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"I consider it a high need because I doubt Hawthorne will be healthy the whole season(missed  4 games last year), and Ellerbe missed all of last season with  hip injury. Both being really close to 30, makes the lack of depth at the position(literally just Humbar) far more worrisome.  IMO we need a linebacker to improve our pass defense, last year the LBs were the worst part of our pass defense. Hawthorne and Ellerbe can adequately play the run. We don't think we need a three down LB, we need some one to play the nickel and replace one either of our starters on passing downs. Limiting their snaps would help minimize injuries.  With this in mind I like Eric Kendricks, Shaq Thompson, Kwon Alexander , Ben Heeney. They are all exceptional in coverage."
Saints,31p5us,flordeliest,5,Tue Apr 7 03:03:42 2015 UTC,"No love for Anthony?  Also, I like Shaq Thompson a lot, but I just don't see him fitting well in our defense. He's a LB/S hybrid type, and he doesn't really have the size to be a 3-4 ILB (I would be really worried about his durability), so he would really just be a nickel LB for us. I'd be stoked to get him in the 2nd round, but I don't think he'll be there at 44 and I wouldn't take him in the 1st."
Saints,31p5us,sfzen,7,Tue Apr 7 08:34:00 2015 UTC,"Also, we played Vacarro a lot around the LOS his rookie year, not so much last year.

Saints,31p5us,twags88,3,Wed Apr 8 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"I like Anthony a lot he is the most athletic LBs in the draft, but I didn't see much of him in down field coverage.  I agree Shaq would automatically be a nickel LB if he can't sustain 230ish, but even then I doubt that's his only role with the Saints. As far as I'm concerned a nickel LB is exactly what we need, even if that's is only role. I personally believe he would only come off the field during run situations. He played the run extremely well at Washington, its only the size thing that's the issue. He would be huge on special teams. I'm more worried about Hawthorne and Ellerbe's durability."

We can trade our entire draft and a 2016 late second rounder (I believe) to move up to 1st overall.  Note:  The chart doesn't specify how comp picks affect the formula.  They obviously can't be traded, but I'm not sure if they deflate the value of the picks that follow them.    ANYWHO, I don't think we should move up at all.

I don't even think that this photo is from Porter's Super Bowl interception. Sharper is a good 30 yards back in this photo. For fucks sake, at least change the photo to the Super Bowl interception and you will have the added bonus of not having a rapist in the background.

Knowing what he did off the field, I don't ever want to see that fucker's face. He's a disgusting piece of human shit. Real life trumps what happens on the field 100% of the time."

So I say take it down. He doesn't desire to be the face of any saints propaganda ever again . He lost this privilege and honor. Perhaps after he's paid his debt to society for his horrible crimes we can discuss acknowledging him again.. But even then I'd still say no."
Saints,31k13j,Briguy_fieri,3,Mon Apr 6 04:39:27 2015 UTC,Maybe changing that image to the one with Porter posing post touchdown? Same moment sans Sharper?
Saints,31k13j,baconlovr,2,Sun Apr 5 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't change his abilities as a player, but the Saints have been trying to clean our image, whether Bountygate or locker room issues. I seen people's photoshopping abilities on the Internet. Why not shop him out? I'd prefer to not have our SB victory associated with him. I hate how it's ""former Saint charged with rape"" not ""NFL Network analyst"". That era was a bad time for the image of the Saints. I just want him gone"
Saints,31k13j,pottersquash,2,Mon Apr 6 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"On one hand, I'd say keep it up.  He was a part of that team and we wouldn't have gotten there without him.  On the other hand, if you were a victim would you really want to see that when you're having a good time before a game?  That's like one of those Penn State kids going to a game and seeing massive Sandusky posters.  Doesn't seem right."

Saints,31k13j,TacoExcellence,3,Mon Apr 6 12:46:33 2015 UTC,Well Sharper isn't really the focal point of that image. It's Porter's pick-6 and Sharper is just part of the background. I'm fine with cutting him out of it.

Hell, wear your Eagles jersey if you want. Besides maybe one or two drunk idiots, people should leave you alone.  I'm really trying to come to a game this year. Just not sure which one.

The history, food, culture, music, etc is all within walking or trolley distance (including the stadium). In general, I prefer supporting a local business over a chain (just a personal preference; but in this case, it worked out beyond our best expectations!).   We walked from the Quarter to the stadium; Saints fans the whole way there, and back after the game (as mentioned above).   Check out the Wiki for travel tips from the locals and a few review guides. Feel free to PM me if you would like any details from our adventure last year.   When buying your seats, check out the linked stadium map in the Wiki. StubHub doesn't have hidden fees, but Ticketmaster tacks on a heavy percentage (bastards) at the end of the sale. Our game was in November. I purchased our tickets at the end of July (hoping to get a slight deal buying so early).   Hope your trip is amazing! And, of course, Geaux Saints!"

Depending on the game time, you want to go somewhere and get a pre-game bloody mary or three and some breakfast - I'd suggest walkable distance restaurant: Luke, Johnny Sanchez, Juan's Flying Burritto, Plaza Hotel (apparently a great buffet, haven't tried it myself).  Avoid Walk On's or Happy's - they're stupid crowded, impossible to get service.  Other local restaurants also good, or just bars."

Saints,31l6le,ashsky,5,Mon Apr 6 09:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is one reason why I HATE player trades and refuse to take part in them in mocks.  They're unrealistic, and GMs forget to look at cap considerations.  Case in point?  He put Junior Galette on the trade block.  As I mentioned in the thread of /r/NFL_Draft, that ain't happening.  They just converted his roster bonus into a signing bonus.  If he's traded, instead of being spread out over the remainder of his contract, all of it would count for this year."
Saints,31l6le,DoctorWhosOnFirst,2,Mon Apr 6 11:51:38 2015 UTC,"I really can't see the Saints taking a WR as their first draft pick, but I like all the other ones."
Saints,31l6le,baconlovr,5,Mon Apr 6 14:32:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it is a very poor draft.  The DeVante Parker pick is extremely forced. I have a feeling y'all tried to get cute and be ""different"" when Dupree is on the board and even though I wouldn't like it, the top CB too. We'd start looking like the old Lions if we go WR again. It's flashy but not what we need this early when there are much bigger needs.  Dawson is a reach. If Kendricks had gone, then Anthony and someone else had the potential, sure he's fine but only Kendricks had gone. There was 0 chance that an ILB wouldn't be there in the 2nd.  Matias and Phillips are okay, Ifo is good but neither of the 3 are going to be starter/getting starter reps.  Brooks is a whiny little bitch (the kind we just got rid of in Stills) who not only has an average pass rushing record but also carries a contract we cannot take.  So, we walk away with a new #3 receiver, an average ILB who will be forced to play, some bench talent and an OLB who has been shown to be cancerous to the locker room. No drastic improvements whilst the rest of the division upgraded majorly, I'd be a wee bit worried."
Saints,31l6le,ashsky,4,Mon Apr 6 09:38:58 2015 UTC,"This is the problem when you start using your opinion as facts. I usually trust your opinion, Ash, but I think you're off on this one.  Dupree is no guarantee at all. I love him as a prospect, don't get me wrong, but he definitely has his flaws and is going to need work. Parker has the ability from day one to step in and be a WR1. We lost 2 of our biggest receiving options and are bound to lose a third in the next year or two. I think a WR is a pretty solid need for us.  With Dawson, again your opinion. MY opinion is that he's better than any LB not named Kendricks (and Kendricks is probably suited better for a 43, so that bumps up Dawson for the Saints for me more). Everybody is jumping on the Anthony bandwaggon, but he's still very raw prospect. There was no other value to take there at 31, so instead of hoping there isn't a run on LBs and being forced to pick one we may not have wanted at 44, we decided to have our pick of the litter.  I really liked the Matias and Phillips picks I think was really good value for each, especially Phillips. Ifo I'm meh about but the other guys wanted him and I didn't care.  I do agree with you about the Brooks trade tho. I'm not a fan and I wouldn't have done it personally. I wasn't present when the trade was made tho.  Overall we came away with a bunch of guys who are going to compete for starting positions from day one. And a chance for a couple impact players."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:40:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with selecting Parker in my view is that the difference in WR talent available after Amari Cooper and potentially White is so minimal that I do not feel it is worth it. Parker didn't even put up great stats when he had Teddy Bridgewater throwing for him but coupled on that, he has a dropping issue along with lazy routes. Parker at 13 is not a huge gap from someone like Tyler Lockette in the 3rd as stats show. Comparatively, the difference between Dupree and an equivalent round OLB is absolutely massive. It goes from a ""potential"" star to someone who is extremely mediocre. That is the issue with picking WR, much more is being given up for someone with less upside. I just cannot think of any case where the best situation would be taking him at 13 especially if we're planning for the future too.  Paul Dawson can definitely be argued either way. His production at the college level is undeniable and so it all depends on those character issues which only the coaches will know, I guess. I don't know how a lack of talent can be argued for 31.. AJ Cann is available although he isn't the best fit, he's an incredible talent for a specialist LG. DJ Humphries had dropped, fantastic player. DGB who if Parker wasn't taken, would have been a very viable option. Either way, there's great talent and you're losing minimal by waiting for an ILB. It's the definition of ""BPA"" whilst also sticking to needs.  I guess it all does come down to opinion but I just do not see any scenario where the best option is Parker at 13. The rest I can understand at least to a degree. Oh well, only a mock. I do enjoy discussing it all, though I can come across as an asshole a lot it is all taken on-board and all discussion is in the interest of our team."
Saints,31l6le,ashsky,2,Mon Apr 6 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"See, that's where we differ. I think it's Parker and then the drop off, not White and then the drop off. You brought up Lockett but I just don't the no we need another 5'10"" guy. We need a bigger body, especially for when Colston is gone, and I'm skeptical the FO would draft a guy like DGB with his CC.  I feel like both WR and EDGE are very deep. The difference between Dupree (who can obviously become elite) and a guy like Owa, Orchard or Mauldin is similar to Parker(who, like Dupree can also he elite) and whomever you get in the second or third whether it's Perriman, Lockett, Coates etc.  And trust me, I love Dupree. I've said it before I'm on the badwaggon for a while now."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:41:05 2015 UTC,After 5 rounds the Saints are walking away with:  DeVante Parker  Paul Dawson  Jordan Phillips  Josue Matias  Ifo Ekpre-Olomu  Zach Hodges  Ahmad Brooks  7th round pick  I could live with this IRL. Solid haul at a lot of areas of need.
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not huge fan of this draft, but I am happy we went in on Ifo. He was a great CB at Oregon. In the NFL I think he will translate to a CB2 kind of guy. He lacks the size to cover some of the bigger guys, but he did a decent job on Cooks when they lined up vs each other. I could see him being especially good vs the slot, but then again I am no expert."

Saints,31l6le,Saints2Death,0,Mon Apr 6 03:24:57 2015 UTC,I guess the 49er fan thought he was expendable. I would love to have him on our team in real life Haha.
Saints,31l6le,Easybrees009,0,Mon Apr 6 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"Since when is Dawson a 1st rounder? He has been a late to mid second rounder since his pro-day. Most sources don't have him above McKinney, Thompson or even Anthony."
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,2,Mon Apr 6 04:14:33 2015 UTC,"He could be worth a first but he is absolutely not in this draft. Seeing as nobody took an ILB except Kendricks going, it's quite obvious that Dawson wasn't going to be taken that early so there is absolutely no need to draft him at 31."
Saints,31l6le,ashsky,0,Mon Apr 6 09:21:25 2015 UTC,"It's no secret that I don't like Dawson to the Saints. Regardless of my bias he is clearly the riskiest ILB in this draft. He is undersized, slow and relied on instincts alone at TCU. That plus the rumors of his lack of worth ethic, doesn't study film and shows up to meetings late. There isn't much to be excited about besides his highlight-reel."
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:32:10 2015 UTC,"There are no issues with his work ethic/watching tape as far as I've heard at least). The issue was he would show up late (not that I'm defending that at all. It definitely needs to be fixed, but its an easy fix)."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:50:31 2015 UTC,That is definitely not an easy fix and it is quite worrisome.
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:37:07 2015 UTC,"Of all things that could be wrong, how is that not an easy fix lol? Especially in the NFL. Players get fined for being late. This isn't college where the coaches need the players just as much as the inverse. Coaches don't put up with that stuff and a player who really wants to be on the team would fix that. Being late to meetings is a very very fixable issue. It's not like it's a character or attitude thing like being an asshole or cancer - it's a leave 15 minutes earlier than normal thing."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:51:26 2015 UTC,"There has been some harsh things said about Dawson, if true the concern is absolutely and attitude problem and not easily fixed because payers don't usually get second chances in the NFL. I pushes him out of the first round for me."
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,0,Mon Apr 6 22:35:57 2015 UTC,"That's understandable. His athleticism isn't the greatest so he relies on ""Instinct"", #1 bust material. The rumors are worrying and if true (the coaching staff would know from interviews with him & colleagues) then he is definitely not worth a 1st at all. Mckinney, Anthony, Perryman, Kendricks all have much better natural talent and athleticism but just not as polished.  I definitely agree he is the riskiest ILB of this draft with potentially a very low ceiling. I do feel that he has the best technique outside of Kendricks though and that could help him but I wouldn't spend a 1st on him unless ILBs started dropping like flys."
Saints,31l6le,ashsky,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is the most polished at all, have you seen him engage blocks or drop into coverage? Getting to the ball is the only thing he excels at."

Saints,31l6le,DoctorWhosOnFirst,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:49:09 2015 UTC,I totally agree. He's said it for a while now too. Outside of Kendricks Dawson is the best coverage LB. idk how you can't watch his games and not think that.
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:47:20 2015 UTC,Some people put all their faith in how fast someone runs a 40 in gym shorts with several months to train.
Saints,31l6le,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:59:57 2015 UTC,Yep. Tape >>> 40. Too many people get fixated on a couple work out numbers. Do you want a team full of athletes or a team of football players.   And really if Dawson had had his Pro day numbers at the combine there'd he no issues with him in people's minds. But for some reason they're still letting his combine(even tho he more than vindicated them) convolute their minds about him.
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,0,Mon Apr 6 17:08:06 2015 UTC,What really gets me with the /r/NFL_Draft hive mind and these mocks is how undervalued users have put three very high valued positions in the draft.   When was the last draft that a tackle wasn't taken in the Top 5? It's more common for multiple tackles to be picked in the Top 5 than none.   When was the last time a defensive back wasn't taken in the Top 10? Most of these only have between 3 or 4 DBs total taken in the first round and Collins is usually the first safety taken and he last until the 20s. That's just crazy.
Saints,31l6le,Saints2Death,0,Mon Apr 6 17:46:18 2015 UTC,"Really? I disagree he does alright in coverage, but I don't expect him to make a play if he is more than 5 yds down field. He is blitzed way more often at TCU than used in coverage on passing downs, from the games I have seen he was blitzing on almost every down near the end. None of his ints are more than a yard from the line of scrimmage.  Edit; I actually haven't seen the int during the Samford game, because its not on DraftBreakdown."
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 6 11:58:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's the best in coverage, but I think he's above average.  That's the impression I got from his tape, and the consensus of what I've read on him seems to be that he's pretty solid in coverage.   Obviously this is just one example, but this was one of my favorite plays of his."
Saints,31l6le,DoctorWhosOnFirst,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:26:08 2015 UTC,"This is not true at all. He was a top 3 ILB and creeping into the mid-late first BEFORE the combine. Then his poor combine knocked him down to mid-late second status in some people's eyes.   Then AFTER he redeemed himself and had a great pro day, he's being valued back at that late first, early second round grade by many, IMO. Since he put to rest those question marks about his athleticism he left at the combine.   Most relevant and credible sources had Dawson as a top 3 or 2 ILB before the combine, and back there after his Pro Day.   People need to stop using CBS Sports as an end-all-be-all. It can be used as a tool, but there needs to be other sources along with it, or a better option watch the tape and form own opinions. I'm not a scout, never will be and don't claim to be. But after Dawson put his combine red flags to rest at his Pro Day, I don't understand how you can't watch his games and not love his game as an NFL prospect."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,-2,Mon Apr 6 05:30:36 2015 UTC,"Dawson is undersized at 235, slightly below average speed with character and work ethic concerns, which were reinforced by his poor combine. He played behind a great D-line in a very Simple defense at TCU. He eludes blockers rather than engaging and shedding like he is supposed to, and has trouble catching ball-carriers from behind. He is often making blind gambles when he makes a spectacular play.  He has great instincts but no one is sure he has the physical attributes or work ethic to be relevant at the NFL level. He isn't a first round pick from concerns alone. This is why Anthony and McKinney are usually rated higher than him."
Saints,31l6le,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:20:11 2015 UTC,"He's pretty much the same size as Kendricks, but that doesn't seem to bother most people for his case. His pro day 40 was about average for the position and his 3-cone drill was an elite speed. He doesn't have straight-line, down the field top gear, but he's very quick/fast in short burst and covering small areas - like the box.   McKinney is bad in coverage, and is always a step late. Anthony, while promising is much more of a project than Dawson.  I would say right now the ONLY ILBs worth a first round selection are Kendricks and Dawson."
Saints,31l6le,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:32:47 2015 UTC,"Kendricks is also consider undersized but he is a beast in coverage and has a great nose for the ball.  McKinney coverage ability isn't any worse than Dawson's. McKinney just has worse foot work in drills and doesn't change direction very well, which is understandable because he is way bigger. Neither are doing anything impressive on the tape, but Dawson can just plain get his body in gear quicker. McKinney is huge and more athletic than Dawson, I could easily see him being an OLB/ILB hybrid in our defense. This is a bad comparison to begin with.  Anthony isn't a project, if he is than so is Dawson. Anthony has the same style of nose for the ball linebacking, but he has much better burst closing on the ball, is actually a good athlete, and with a much better football IQ. The biggest difference between the two is, Anthony reacts and makes plays with his athleticism, while Dawson is more or less taking gambles with a surprising success rate. Yet Anthony consistently met ball carriers closer to the line of scrimmage than Dawson. My biggest concern is when he gambles wrong he is completely missing from the play, where a more athletic LB wouldn't, and that the things he is reading are only typical of college level football. Then you hear outright that he doesn't study film, his coaches don't like him, he shows up to meeting late and TCU's defense is really simple for college level football. I can't imagine how he is a first round prospect.  His quickness may have help Dawson elude or out maneuver a blocker in college but that wont be the case in the NFL. You can see he doesn't engage, stack up and shed well against blockers from his film.  Personally, I don't believe New Orleans needs any of the three because I don't think any of them can do anything on the field that Ellerbe and Hawthorne can't already do and would not immediately improve the defense, though I'd prefer the higher upside guys more."

Saints,31had0,LesBonTempsNOLA,9,Sun Apr 5 01:53:08 2015 UTC,"The sad part is that he only played a few games with us and he wasn't even with the team when we won the superbowl. According to his wiki page he was cut in early december. Also, his craigslist ad has him selling it from Atlanta (ugh). Only good thing, I guess, is that he's the one who forced the fumble in that close Redskins game. Keepin' that win streak alive."

Saints,31ffkz,TedCabbage,2,Sun Apr 5 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"That was an awful call tbf. The packers strength at the time was the middle of their defense, we'd had decent success outside all day, it was just a really bad idea to try and punch it in up the middle, with our new alabama running back or not."

Saints,31bghl,JohnTesh,3,Fri Apr 3 17:33:17 2015 UTC,No he actually took a pay cut. His cap hits have been significantly reduced.
Saints,31bghl,krazy9000,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"According to the article he got a close to six million dollar signing bonus on a guaranteed year contract extension. Those two things kind of offset the pay cuts.  Still a great thing to do, and I am grateful he did it."
Saints,31bghl,JohnTesh,4,Sat Apr 4 03:10:27 2015 UTC,"Cool, now we're set to be able to sign our draft picks. Bring on April 30th!"
Saints,31bghl,cfiggis,2,Fri Apr 3 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, I believe he received a $5.4M signing bonus as part of his new deal, so it's not as if he took a massive pay cut, although it still is a decent pay cut when you factor in that he cut down his salary a bit next year too. This was more of a contract restructuring that involved a bit of a pay cut than a straight pay cut like the one's Colston or Bunkley or Hawthorne took. Still awesome that him and the Saints were able to work it out."

Saints,31bghl,baconlovr,3,Fri Apr 3 17:28:36 2015 UTC,You think he gets extended next off-season? I could see them doing 2 more years and reduce his cap hit for next year.

Saints,31bghl,DaveThe_blank_,0,Fri Apr 3 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"The team doesn't feel the need to do anything with his contract, and I agree with them.  Altering his deal is the epitome of kicking the can down the road and would hurt us more in the season after his departure than anything else.  The only people who want to restructure Brees's deal are those who have no concept of the salary cap and how things actually work in the real world."

Saints,31cxqd,TimVicious,1 point,Sat Apr 4 06:36:05 2015 UTC,At the most we would have been able to pay him 10 mil maybe one more season. He wasn't worth that much before the injuries and drop in production.  I'm going to miss him though.
Saints,31cxqd,flordeliest,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:41:59 2015 UTC,"It's hard to live up to the expectations when you don't have Drew friggin' Brees throwing to you. People laud Russell Wilson, and I don't mean ill on the guy, but his mentality is run first, panic/scramble second. He's just not as good of a thrower as people make him out to be. That will not pan out well for Graham."
Saints,31cxqd,wyschnei,0,Thu Apr 9 00:24:52 2015 UTC,"He did seem kinda lazy playing for us last season. Maybe it was because he didn't get that huge WR contract he was after, or maybe there was some other reason. But he seemed pretty excited to go to Seattle and maybe he'll step up his game over there.   In any case, he wasn't any good for us anymore, so we did a great job picking up an incredibly valuable set piece to give Brees more time to work his magic in the pocket."

Saints,31cxqd,JimTokle,5,Sat Apr 4 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"Don't let the downvotes get to you. It's perfectly fine to like other teams.   I look at it like this: I'm in a long term, monogamous relationship with the Saints and will stick with them no matter what happens. If another pretty team walks by, I might turn my head and look.

Saints,31clh2,msteel8,6,Fri Apr 3 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"Same here. Jimmy was a top 2 tight end. He was phenomenal at his position. It would be much easier to replace his production with a receiver, because tight ends of his caliber just don't widely exist. We just all think we need a great tight end bc we were spoiled by Jimmy. The truth is, we just need guys for drew to throw. There are probably 5-6 receivers in this draft that will be more productive than the best TE. In this draft."
Saints,31clh2,Charizard_Targaryen,8,Fri Apr 3 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"I really hate the ""The Saints lost Jimmy Graham, so lets have them draft a TE with the pick they got for him"" logic.   I'd be pretty un-pleased with this 1st round tbh."
Saints,31clh2,Brees2Graham,3,Sat Apr 4 05:03:40 2015 UTC,"Unless Cooper or White somehow fell to us, I don't see us going offense in either 1st round pick. I don't even remember the last time we took OL that early either. The earliest I can remember is Charles Brown and he was a 2nd round pick. We find good value OL in the middle rounds (Evans, Strief, Bushrod, Nicks were all 4th round and beyond). I see OLB/CB/ILB as top priorities unless we take BPA."

Saints,319itt,Frohirrim,3,Fri Apr 3 16:37:29 2015 UTC,Exactly. Moves we made were definitely eye popping but you can't argue that were trying to get better. In hindsight I friggin love the jimmy trade.
Saints,319itt,Megawatts19,6,Fri Apr 3 19:54:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I love it. I'll love it if Unger stays healthy. If he only plays 6 games a season for the rest of his contract, we got burnt."
Saints,319itt,Saints2Death,4,Fri Apr 3 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"Well, let me rephrase. I love the message it sends. The change in mentality going back to a strong OL. Whether it works out or not...that's the gamble in trading."
Saints,319itt,Megawatts19,2,Fri Apr 3 17:05:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love the message it sends, but I hate that the two players we received in trades have missed so many games recently. I think depth is the biggest issue we face in 2015, and two of the three biggest areas of concern we have with depth is the offensive line and linebackers."

Saints,319itt,Saints2Death,6,Fri Apr 3 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing at first. SP was preaching about changing the locker room attitudes, but I started to think into it more. Maybe his attitude changed after the wake up call. He got cut from our team, and no other team had interest in signing him after that. Depending on his salary numbers, the signing may not even guarantee his spot. Let's see if he got his act together."

Saints,317pqi,Easybrees09,23,Thu Apr 2 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"A good article that I think most of us agree with. Protect the pocket, win the game. When you have an elite QB like Brees who is capable of making any receiver into a superstar, then you don't need extraordinary talent downfield, you need that talent on the line protecting your signal caller. I think that since the Graham trade, all the fans (with common sense) have come to realize this fact."
Saints,317pqi,baconlovr,10,Thu Apr 2 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"Even with talent like Graham, what is the point in having it if you don't have enough time to get the ball there. Part of Jimmy's lack of performance this last year had a lot to do with Brees not even having time to get him the ball."
Saints,317pqi,GenrlWashington,7,Thu Apr 2 20:19:09 2015 UTC,This makes so much sense if you look back at a lot of the game tape a lot of times Brees isnt even throwing on the landing spot anymore.
Saints,317pqi,ohhgod,11,Thu Apr 2 18:59:00 2015 UTC,A clean pocket and an offseason for Brees and Brandin Cooks makes me very very excited for this season. Kid can fly.

Saints,317pqi,Megawatts19,8,Fri Apr 3 02:55:59 2015 UTC,So it seems like it's more and more likely that we'll take an O-lineman in the 1st round. I wouldn't be surprised if we pounce on Scherff if he's there at #13.
Saints,317pqi,sfzen,7,Thu Apr 2 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see this. When you have a 7-9 season and the coach says they're going to have to reexamine every part of the organization, it can amount to a lot of hot air.  But this shows that it's not just talk. There are specific reasons for the moves other than ""oh shit the salary cap!"" That doesn't make the moves a foregone conclusion for success, but it gives me hope that they have a good chance of succeeding.  Looking forward to that draft, too. I live in Chicago and I'm hoping to win tickets to attend in person."

Was it contract issues? Alex lacerated his spleen last season because of how bad our Oline was, is Grubbs gonna help or hurt in that regard?"
Saints,317pqi,channingman,4,Thu Apr 2 21:58:57 2015 UTC,Grubbs is still an above average guard.  No worries there.
Saints,317pqi,smokeajay,2,Thu Apr 2 23:00:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. :) Above average is all I'm asking right now lol.
Saints,317pqi,channingman,0,Thu Apr 2 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"Grubbs has some great game left Cap had a lot to do with it as well as the talent behind him, Tim Lelito. Wishing the Chiefs luck this year"
Saints,317pqi,KTDL,2,Fri Apr 3 00:55:53 2015 UTC,Precisely. Why have superstars to throw the ball to if Brees doesn't have time to throw it accurately
Saints,317pqi,agarret83,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:23:15 2015 UTC,A team can be successful without a superstar wideout if they have an accurate qb who has time to throw coupled with a strong running game. Look no further than the 2009 Saints.
Saints,317pqi,SleepingAntz,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:17:23 2015 UTC,Hopefully they draft a guard early.
Saints,317pqi,jackmuhswag,3,Thu Apr 2 22:01:01 2015 UTC,I just hope Lelito is better as a guard than center.
Saints,317pqi,smilefortony,2,Fri Apr 3 02:46:41 2015 UTC,"it's his original position, and he'll have better central support.  I think he'll perform ably"
Saints,317pqi,serenity_suppository,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Or Kelemete. People are sleeping on him, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him take the starting job."
Saints,317pqi,Megawatts19,2,Fri Apr 3 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"honestly, I don't know much about the guy. What can you tell me about him? I've heard lots of people throwing his name around. Where is everyone getting this sense that he's good? (serious question)"
Saints,317pqi,smilefortony,2,Fri Apr 3 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"I've only seen him play in preseason. So take that for what it is. But this preseason, both Grubbs and Evans were injured so our backup guards were getting a lot of snaps. It seemed like every time we broke a big run, Senio was the one that sprung it. Then, when the season started, Grubbs really didn't look much better than Senio did. Granted. This is all conjecture but I think the FO would not have traded Grubbs had they not thought they had a good replacement on the roster."
Saints,317pqi,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"The reason: he doesn't like to take sacks.   I get that logic, but forcing a pass to a receiver only to have it picked is much worse than taking the sack."
Saints,317pqi,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:54:19 2015 UTC,"In football sense, yes. But as a player, especially one who's already almost lost his career to injury, taking as few sacks as he can ensures that he can keep playing. Self-preservation plays a role too."
Saints,317pqi,psquared85,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:00:59 2015 UTC,"I understand that but if he ""doesn't want to take a sack"" go do like Peyton and Brady do. Don't force something just because you don't want to get hit. Because, chances are, if you're feeling enough pressure to force your throw, you're likely going to take a shot, regardless."
Saints,317pqi,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:06:45 2015 UTC,Given enough time any receiver will get open. Its a guarantee.

He's a damn good player and could be a welcomed boost to the secondary, and I feel Keenan & Browner could help keep him in line and teach him the ways of the locker room."

Saints,316xu5,Terp2it,6,Thu Apr 2 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Damn, just checked out our remaining schedule and it looks pretty tough. Portland, Memphis, and Houston on the road will be tough.  Minnesota and Sacramento should be wins, but at least we get to face Spurs and Warriors at home.  Though OKC has basically the exact same schedule left except they get the Pacers instead of the Warriors and play more games at home which is going to make it tough for us to catch up."
Saints,316xu5,sydwaz8,3,Thu Apr 2 17:48:41 2015 UTC,Portland going to be a test.  Warriors will be difficult but hopefully they rest players we played a good game against them earlier this year without AD (Anthony Davis) and took it to overtime.  We have beaten Memphis(2-1) in Memphis and at home.   We have beaten Houston (2-1) in Houston and at home.  We have beaten Spurs (2-1) in Spurs and at home.  Suns will a tough game because they will want to stay in it.   I wouldn't count Wolves game to be a walk in the park they have two young star that looked good the other day.
Saints,316xu5,TotesMessenger,7,Thu Apr 2 19:10:13 2015 UTC,Yes! It would be amazing to have a big loud crowd for this final playoff push. New Orleans can be a basketball city too!

Saints,317iyi,atn420,2,Thu Apr 2 16:44:59 2015 UTC,Guy would be great for us. Maybe a target at 31?
Saints,317iyi,Saints2Death,2,Thu Apr 2 17:58:22 2015 UTC,I think 44 is more realistic
Saints,317iyi,Bouzal,2,Thu Apr 2 18:52:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think he'll last that long. If you put your faith in user created big boards over a /r/NFL_Draft or even analysts big boards and mock drafts, you might be right. In reality though, AJ Cann could easily be the first interior lineman taken because no one know individual team's boards.   I get so tired of the over analyzing of draft prospects this time of year. People keep believing their own BS because the hive mind says this player is supposed to go to this specific team and this player had to be a 2nd rounder. But year after year it's proven over and over that big boards and mock drafts are complete bull shit. But people seems to always ignore that."
Saints,317iyi,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:17:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think Cann is in the cards for us. We probably don't want to draft him with 31, but you're right to think he would be gone by then. I think John Miller and Tre Jackson are some good prospects a bit later"
Saints,317iyi,Bouzal,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Could be right, but all it takes it Payton/Ireland to think he's our guy and he'll be drafted, logically at 31.  Tre Jackson doesn't fit our system at all, so we would never draft him and I think Cann is much, much better prospect than Miller."
Saints,317iyi,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:27:10 2015 UTC,"Neither AJ Cann or Tre fit our scheme. Obviously Cann has more upside but Tre would be worth a 3rd instead of using a 1st on hoping when can mold someone who doesn't currently have the ability.  Of course Cann is a much better prospect.. He's projected late first, Miller will most probably be around late 3rd/4th. This Guard class is quite trash and Aj is only average especially compared to earlier classes. Not worth 31 imo."

It's quite obvious we are moving away from a pass heavy offense, and Payton said at the owner's meeting that Brandon Coleman and Seantavius Jones would have a bigger roles next season."
Saints,314gg1,flordeliest,4,Wed Apr 1 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"Why would you stray away from a pass heavy offense when you have an elite quarterback?  That pass heavy offense led you to the Superbowl.  You guys didn't lean towards the run more because y'all wanted to do that.  y'all did it because Ingram was stepping up and your linemen blocked better in the run, than in the pass.  Before Ingram this past year, you guys didn't have a workhorse back."
Saints,314gg1,NewRedditorHere,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:28:02 2015 UTC,A more balanced offense is far more effective and consistent.
Saints,314gg1,flordeliest,3,Thu Apr 2 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"Really, because The Saints offense has been pretty effective and consistent for years being extremely pass heavy."
Saints,314gg1,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:58:25 2015 UTC,"See the problem is we move far too quickly on offense. We either score really quickly or we stall out just as quickly. Our defense is barely off the field enough to be  consistently effective, it also leads to far more injuries. Being more committed to the run helps us keep leads and basically shorten games."
Saints,314gg1,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:05:27 2015 UTC,Would make sense if the Saints were in the bottom of the league in time of possession.
Saints,314gg1,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"We aren't any where close to the bottom,  but that because our offense at its worst can can somewhat move the ball better than most teams. Brees is the man."

Saints,314gg1,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 1 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"I hadn't posted there for like a week,  until today.  You know what I rarely take speculation seriously, so I tend to be the one against the grain."
Saints,314gg1,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily agree with it, but I could understand it. They know that the biggest competition in the NFC is going to be the Seahawks for the next couple of years. With the cover 3 they run, you need guys who can catch the ball underneath and be shifty enough to get upfield in space. With cooks and spiller here now, one more weapon in that would be very hard for them to contend with."
Saints,312hs3,neovenator250,4,Wed Apr 1 15:47:44 2015 UTC,It sounds like we're probably giving him more guaranteed money to push his cap hits into later years when we'll have more money. I can't imagine he'll actually play for us through 2017.  But I hope he proves me wrong!
Saints,312hs3,EternalWitness,-3,Wed Apr 1 16:35:38 2015 UTC,Isn't that what made you guys have to trade graham and stills and release Lofton and Thomas?
Saints,312hs3,oballistikz,3,Wed Apr 1 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"Made? No. Lofton was to be paid about 10 mil. Saints do not need 10 mil at MLB, and if you ask Payton, no team does. With Cam, Ryan, Winston/Maroita you need a MLB who can cover both receivers and ground to get to protect sidelines.  Stills wasn't a cap casualty at all. Graham could have been, but also could just have been moving a luxury item for a necessary one."
Saints,312hs3,pottersquash,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:15:48 2015 UTC,Cool thanks. I agree with the Lofton. That is essentially why we let him go. Though you'd think in a 3-4 you could get away with it a little bit easier but I honestly don't know if you guys had a good coverage guy.

Saints,312gfg,MalConstant,13,Wed Apr 1 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"Jets fan here. He consistently got burned in coverage, and if the ball was overthrown, he'd celebrate by wagging his finger at the WR as if he did something to prevent the catch. The guy has been mediocre at best, but PFF liked him as a slot corner. Serviceable at best, but never quite lived up to the 1st round pick."

Tough day all around...  In all honesty though, I probably didn't hate him as much as other Jet fans did, probably because I bought a lot into his high scores on PFF.

Saints,312eiu,MistaChopstix,2,Wed Apr 1 15:49:41 2015 UTC,"I agree but I think we need both. We have toon and colston who have size, but really no one real speedy comes to mind besides cooks. Stills was a great deep threat so I think we need to get a replacement for him, but also get a guy that has size and ability to block."
Saints,312eiu,jackmuhswag,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:01:21 2015 UTC,I'm sure Payton knows better than anyone else what we need or not.
Saints,312eiu,Saints2Death,2,Wed Apr 1 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see size as a major issue when it comes to how Dorsett would fit in NOLA. If the folks on Airline Dr. have confidence in one or two of Toon, Jones, or Coleman, then I think Dorsett would be a great pick 3rd, possibly 2nd.   Look at how the Patriots utilize both Edelman (in the Z) and Amendola (in the slot)--smaller receivers who run good routes and have speed/hands--alongside LaFell (in the X). This setup has been beyond productive for N.E. the last few seasons, it's just so difficult to stop. Couple this with an Ingram/Khiry/Spiller backfield, and you have a fun little offense (with a new, revamped O-line to boot).  And Perryman? Go watch the Miami game against FSU and see for yourself. I would love one of him, Kendricks, or Anthony."

Also, if you get a shot to buy extra seats are you willing to sell the rights to those potential seats.  I have a good friend who likely will be very interested in this, but won't lie she will try to haggle you down a bit. But I think I can convince her to take a shot given she will get face value tickets and the right to finally get her own.  Also, you are in Greater New Orleans right?"
Saints,3134ze,Bunnyhat,2,Wed Apr 1 23:06:54 2015 UTC,"Yes I am in the mid city area. I looked into additional seats but there are none available. I am a newer season ticket holder so it would probably be a while before I could even attempt to request more, so I couldn't promise anything unfortunately.   The tickets are paid, and I don't know how payment would work because they haven't shipped so I don't have them in hand. I could talk to the saints office about transferring the mailing to your friend or hold off until they are in hand to exchange payment. I am really looking to get the full $4000 though, that is face value and a TINY bit less than I actually paid, due to a small fee.   Wish I could help with the rights, I lucked into mine bc my ex had way too many and couldn't afford them so signed two over to me!"

EDIT: We haven't been pushing his money back, that's what would happen if he restructured, while extending the life of his contract.

It was really good value and we had already taken 5 other players, so there weren't any other pressing needs except maybe OT depth and a NT, but the value for those positions were not great at our pick. I could get behind a DGB, Funchess, Cooks 3-wide set for the next decade."

The risk/rewards is too good.  Toon looked good late last season, Brandon Coleman will see the field this year with his 6'6"" 225 frame and TE Josh Hill will be a breakout player. TE isn't a need, we will likely address in the later rounds or find an undrafted one. If we draft TE, I really like Walford from Miami."

Saints,30vv53,sfzen,10,Tue Mar 31 20:28:13 2015 UTC,"My only concern with Unger is injuries. If he can stay healthy, I have complete confidence that he can be a pro bowl center for us.  I feel pretty content with our TE's right now. Josh Hill has been very good in limited action, Ben Watson is an experienced vet who is used to winning, and Orson Charles is a versatile TE/FB type that I love as a 3rd TE.  I don't know much about the off-field issues Stills was having, and it sucks to lose him, but I trust the staff, and Ellerbe plus a 3rd was great value, especially with Ellerbe's restructured contract. He immediately takes one of the starting ILB jobs, and should do well in our defense, since he made his name in Baltimore's 3-4 before struggling to convert to a 4-3 in Mami. Even if he's not great, it's not like our ILB situation could have gotten worse...  Losing Grubbs is rough, since I think our O-line issues were almost entirely caused by the lack of a competent starting Center. However, even though Lelito struggled at Center last year, the only reason he got that job was because he did so well at OG before. I think he'll be serviceable as Grubbs' replacement if we don't draft someone, though I hope we can at least pick up someone to compete with him and make him earn the job.  As far as how I feel about next season overall, it's like this: As long as we have Brees, we should expect to make the playoffs. I don't care if our defense sucks, or if we lost offensive firepower. We have a Hall of Fame QB leading an offense that was #1 in the league last year. We had the #31 defense in the league last year, and we were still only half of a game behind the division champs. Any improvements at all to the defense should have us at the very least contending for the division title, and it's hard to get much worse than last year. The NFC South sucks. If our defense can rank at least 25th in the league, I fully expect us to win the division."
Saints,30vv53,SaintsComeMarchingIn,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:59:51 2015 UTC,"I like this breakdown. I agree with everything and I'm stoked about Spiller. He's really putting in the work this offseason from what I can see from his social media, so I know he's just as excited as I am. I really feel like we'll have a great rivalry division this year (I think everyone is pretty even when it comes to talent), especially if the Bucs get a QB. I have faith in our team and can't wait to see Cooks and Spiller racking up points. The NFL will change their tone about us by the next offseason. WHODAT"
Saints,30vv53,bootscallahan,3,Tue Mar 31 12:14:10 2015 UTC,"I envision a winning season and playoff berth (most likely division champions). Once you get in the playoffs, it's anyone's guess, but I wouldn't say we'd be favored to make it past the divisional round. I predict 9-7 or 10-6. I hope I'm being very conservative though."
Saints,30vv53,aimerj,2,Tue Mar 31 03:35:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly, we have a few guys on here who think our O Line is the worst thing ever, when In reality we lost Grubbs and practically replaced him with Unger, they may not be the same position, but where we were weak last year was C and  now it's just moved over to LG. I believe we address guard in 2-3 round, and our O Line is solid. My belief is that last year our Offense was good except for the ridiculous amount of dropped balls by Colston and Graham and fumbles during clutch moments. We had a good O, and will cotinue to as well.I think we need to draft a top shelf wideout I'm the second round, which I do believe will still be available DGB for example, Breshad Perriman, I heard ran 4.25 at his Pro day. TE will be fine with Watson and Hill. RB position has improved, so to me I think we should be going after NT and ILB with our first rounders. And another ILB I believe will drop to 3rd round.  I'm not one who feels we need a high pick on pass rusher, if some guy falls then sure, but other than that I'm not a fan. Now post backstory, I think we make the playoffs the only question to me is if we win the division or just get a wild card spot. I don't think we  will win it. So I personally see us and the Lions in the wild card, playing the Panthers for a 3rd time winning at Bank of America, and ending up playing Eagles, beating them again. And playing the Lions or Packers in the NFC Championship game. Very hopeful! And I could see us going 8-8 haha."
Saints,30vv53,sophandros,2,Tue Mar 31 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"We play the AFC South and the NFC East. I think we go 6-2 or at worst 5-3 there. Within the division, I think we go 4-2. Our other two games are Detroit it home and at Arizona. I say we sweep those.  So 11-5 to 12-4."
Saints,30vv53,Saints2Death,2,Tue Mar 31 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"To me Graham was a luxury we just couldn't afford anymore. He's like driving around in a shiny new Ferrari, which is absolutely incredible. But driving around in a Ferrari is not so great when your house in being foreclosed. So we made the choice, sell the toy and put the money back into the house.   In the grand scheme of things, Graham was a large reason why we had the No. 1 offense. But because he is not there any more, it's not like we will revert to the No. 32 offense. We're still going to be a Top 10 offense, probably closer to 5 than 10, and we freed up a lot of money in the future."

Saints,30vv53,Dabeston,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:51:17 2015 UTC,"Make the playoffs.     The last time the Saints were dominant they had two top corners in Greer and Lewis.  It hasn't been the same since Greer went down.    Browner and a healthy Byrd change everything.   People are quick to forget that Byrd was the only safety mentioned with ET when he was signed, and he was coming off a surgery in the offseason.   I think a healthy Byrd and Browner completely change the defense back to just being weak at LB and the interior line.    I expect more from the running game, which opens up the play action later in the game.  Less yards overall, but more points.    Win the division, make the playoffs."

All of the moves from this offseason are geared towards NEXT season. There are still several holes left to fill and a bunch of guys need to step up. It's possible we could fill a couple holes in the draft (but, they'd have to be competent), and Cooks, Spiller, and others will step up this season. That's why I say playoffs, but a lot will have to fall into place. I'm not as doom and gloom on our O-line anymore. One more offseason where we use our resources wisely to boost the whole team, and I think we're heading towards the NFC championship.   edit- grammar."

Plus, it's conceivable that we're not done with free agency, though I think it's doubtful we sign anyone else significant to anything but a minimal contract."

We need guys that are dependable and not ones that are on the wrong end of the opposing team's scouting report to ""attack"". Both LB spots need be filled in the first 2 rounds. With the depth in this WR class we can probably find a guy in the 3rd that can even be an upgrade from Kenny.   Second tier - DT, OG, CB  These are positions that need to be addressed for depth and future replacements for starters. I think we'll grab a corner in the first 2 rounds with who it looks like will be available. Guard can be addressed in the 3rd. DT can be addressed later unless a guy the staff really likes falls.   Third tier - DE, TE, K  We need depth at DE. We need young depth at TE. And we need a reliable kicker that can kick from 50 yards out. I want the best kicker available and it might be the guy from Louisiana-Monroe. So I wouldn't mind spending a 6th on a kicker. The other two positions can be addressed in the last rounds or with UDFAs."

OG--we are going to need not only someone to compete for a starting spot to give our once feared offensive line an identity again, but depth depth depth at an extremely undervalued position. CB--I agree with OP on this one, SBJ has yet to show that he can be the man we need him to be and Browner doesn't have many good years left.  OLB--again, the Saints were operating at an extremely powerful level on defense whenever they had their LBs not only FLYING to the ball, but getting very involved on pass rushing. A big powerful edge rusher with the ability to get a little depth to help Browner/Lewis out would be fantastic. TE--we have a reliable pass-blocker in Benjamin Watson, and a great route runner/downfield playmaker in Josh Hill. It couldn't hurt to find ourselves a big strong bully who can do both."

Saints,30uwri,ashsky,1 point,Tue Mar 31 06:11:48 2015 UTC,"Results from a Survey conducted where Saints fans voted for /r/nfldraft. Which may help with getting a good general feel.  For me, ILB is an absolute must. Then maybe OLB as we have 0 pass rush, a DT due to Bunkley's age and injuries. Then guard too as Lelito most probably isn't going to be the guy for the future,  WR is obviously something we need to fill but I feel like Brees can make anyone look good and it isn't a priority early on. Similar to CB, I feel that it isn't a huge priority but picking someone up around the 3rd might be important as Breaux + SJB haven't been tried and proven yet especially seeing as Browner hasn't played a full season in forever."

Saints,30uwri,flordeliest,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:50:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not confident in Jenkins and Bunkley. Bunkley is old and just tore his bicep, Jenkins hasn't proved he can be the starting NT, otherwise we would have moved on from Bunkley and saved a bunch of cap space. I'm not confident in Hawthorne and Ellerbe, they have a pretty bad injury history, and  Humbar is still god awful. None of them are cover guys either. After ILB and NT it becomes depth issues.  I personally think the line is set with Lelito at LG, I'm not debating his abilities, but Loomis and Payton both have made statements about him as the starter. Depth along the line is huge question mark because we haven't seen much of anyone outside of Harris and a handful of RG snaps from Kelemete, so we don't know what Payton knows.  DE is kind off thin now with oly Hicks and Jordan with only Glen Foster as backup.   I don't think we draft a WR early because we did that last year, and  Brees can make the young guys, Coleman and S.Jones, on our roster or a late rounder stars.  I don't think we need a cornerback back. After Lewis and Browner, we have Dixon and Fredrick, who is far from unproven and played a bunch last year, SJB should be getting a bigger role and Delvin Breaux who I am most excited for.   I don't consider OLB a need at all Gallete is probably not gonna miss time at this point. If we don't get someone at 13 we have Haralson/Edebali starting opposite of Gallette. We still have fifth rounder Ronald Powell and we signed Jerry Franklin.  We don't draft a TE because this draft is terrible for that and trying to replace Jimmy would be a futile endeavor anyway. Hill and Benjamin can get the job done.  They can really go any direction in the draft, the only thing that would upset me is if they gave way picks to move up. I say we keep our picks and capitalize on fallers. The front office did a good job of setting us up to go BPA in the draft."

Not a fan of Shane Ray a.k.a Junior Galette's clone but the thing that gets me is Armstead. Could go ILB there (our biggest need by far) or Ereck Flowers who has such a high ceiling it's incredible, the guy could be the top OT/G in the entire draft where as Armstead is valued only a little bit higher than Phillips & Bennett.  Mainly though, we're left without an ILB and teams will just run and pass on us all day like they did last year as  Pullard, Hull, Jones, Ryan are simply not good enough to be 3 down backers yet. We're stuck with the same problems as last year :/  Edit: I will add that I do love Jalen Collins for us. His technique isn't great but his physicality is incredible. With Browner & Lewis ahead, someone like him would be perfect to groom as he most probably has the highest ceiling out of any CB in the entire draft, just raw right now."
Saints,30r8zz,ashsky,1 point,Mon Mar 30 09:39:35 2015 UTC,"Also like Matias too, good value but not a fan of Coates for us but that is very debatable.  Always good to see what others think do, I must add. When it's the same people doing our draft in these mocks over and over we just end up with the same players all the time! Great to see different thought patterns and justifications."
Saints,30r8zz,ashsky,1 point,Mon Mar 30 09:44:21 2015 UTC,"I was GM for first round. We went Shane Ray at 1.13 and Arik Armstead at 1.31. I took Armstead over Jalen Collins, TJ Clemmings, and Ereck Flowers. It was hard, but I think he'd be a great fit as a Calais Campbell-type DE."
Saints,30r8zz,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"I like your picks so far. Love the Armstead pick, and you got great value with Collins in the second and Coates in the third. Don't know enough about Matias to have an opinion."
Saints,30r8zz,harveyfjord,1 point,Mon Mar 30 05:39:41 2015 UTC,Yeah. I made sure they fixed the 3.14 problem. The new GM picked Sammie Coates and Josue Matias in the third. May have to go for quantity over quality at ILB later in the draft.
Saints,30r8zz,Brees2Graham,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"Draft died at the end of the third.  Sadly, by pick 44  Anthony, Kendricks, Dawson, McKinney, and Perryman were all gone.  The next ILB on my board was Hayes Pullard and that would have been a reach."
Saints,30r8zz,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:57:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I really thought we could get Armstead at 1.31 and Perryman or someone similar at 2.12. Ray, Armstead, and Perryman would have been a good haul for our front seven, but those ILBs went fast. Good job with Jalen Collins and your offensive choices in the third."

Hopefully this isn't as big of a deal as the initial reports made it out to be. Dixon provides great depth for us in the secondary.
Saints,30pozm,jackmuhswag,10,Sun Mar 29 17:00:33 2015 UTC,"I think Sunseri is going to be a fun player this year. Kid has a ton of heart, is incredibly football smart, and hits like a truck. Will definitely be a contributor on special teams and could see the field a lot too depending on how healthy he can stay"
Saints,30pozm,brandonie187,6,Sun Mar 29 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"I loved watching Vinnie on ST last year, hope he keeps it up.  Powell is supposed to be a great STer as well, I don't remember seeing anything in particular though."
Saints,30pozm,AGQ-,3,Sun Mar 29 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"I like Sunseri, but Brian Dixon looks to me like the best special teamer we've had in years. Dude was all over the punt returners last season as a gunner."
Saints,30pozm,sfzen,2,Mon Mar 30 03:07:43 2015 UTC,"I've got a gut feeling on ""House of the Rising Sunseri""™. All upside with him."
Saints,30pozm,ToddNew,9,Tue Mar 31 00:20:34 2015 UTC,"With any luck we won't need to lean on the performance of SBJ with Willis being healthy and the acquisition of Browner, (and maybe Jaylen Collins). It should be another good year for him to appear in the nickel and take some more time to learn and hone his craft. Powell on the other hand, has some big shoes to fill. Lofton is gone and having to play with a new leader may be a struggle for a young sophomore. Let's hope they both have excellent years in a promising looking (on paper) defense!"
Saints,30pozm,bearcam,7,Sun Mar 29 17:28:50 2015 UTC,Powell is an edge rusher. He would never take over for Lofton and right now is third on the depth chart behind Galette and Edebali.
Saints,30pozm,Saints2Death,6,Sun Mar 29 17:45:50 2015 UTC,I was just saying Powell playing under a new defensive captain might be difficult. I understand he's not an inside LB.
Saints,30pozm,bearcam,4,Sun Mar 29 17:51:41 2015 UTC,"ah, gotcha."
Saints,30pozm,Saints2Death,7,Sun Mar 29 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"Powell is buried in the depth chart, and if we draft an edge rusher high, he becomes expendable. Maybe he'll see time at Will, but he came out of the draft as a pure pass rusher and haven't seen him in any other capacity. He'll definitely play special teams.   SJB will definitely have his role increased, especially with the Dixon's arrest."
Saints,30pozm,Saints2Death,7,Sun Mar 29 17:54:27 2015 UTC,Hopefully we see more of Pierre Warren. That dude shut it down in the little time he played

The guy she ditched was Cam Jordan and the other guy either didn't get drafted or dropped her. She was the most no-frontin' openly-greedy gold digger I've ever known.

Saints,30pfsy,bootscallahan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:07:54 2015 UTC,"we've got too many needs to fill to spend a valuable pick on another RB.   I agree, we just signed 2 RBs, makes no sense drafting another when we have huge holes on our defense and OL."
Saints,30pfsy,Saints4Life_,-1,Mon Mar 30 20:18:24 2015 UTC,I agree its only speculation. I feel like this guy could make our offense even more potent out of the backfield and lets say we trade Khiry like we did Ivory then it could pay for itself.
Saints,30pfsy,jackmuhswag,3,Sun Mar 29 16:11:42 2015 UTC,"Nah, we don't need 2 scat backs. I think our Rb depth is good as is we have other more important needs."
Saints,30pfsy,avaryvox,3,Sun Mar 29 16:11:26 2015 UTC,"We need multiple LBs. And a couple OL. So it would be hard to justify Duke Johnson in the third, but in the fifth I'd be pretty tempted."
Saints,30pfsy,bearcam,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:27:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with the value of another Spiller-esque player, however there is a severe need for depth in many other valuable positions. This year's draft is definitely one for building a team for the future, not the ""right now"", and that's done through constructing a roster with depth in positions other than RB. A Khiry trade is an interesting thought though!"
Saints,30pfsy,evtine,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:21:37 2015 UTC,"The saints have been too good with finding UDFA running backs to justify spending a pick on a 4th string guy.

Saints,30nqvy,DoctorWhosOnFirst,2,Sun Mar 29 05:24:01 2015 UTC,I will shut my trap. Besides Kikaha in the second 10/10 draft. Love the trade back from 31. It could legitimately happen to teams love the fifth year option.
Saints,30nqvy,leader_of_men45,7,Sun Mar 29 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"I was one of the other Saints reps.  I love this draft for us.  We filled our pressing needs with players we like and got great value for Hundley late in the 3rd.    I think some may question passing on Dupree for Shelton.  I was one of the ones who advocated Shelton.  I'm not quite sold on Dupree as a top 15 guy, and we knew there would be good pass-rushers available with our next two picks while top NT talent drops off big time.  Sfzen saved us tonight.  He was the only one who showed up on time, so he handled the 3rd round."
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,3,Sun Mar 29 01:57:51 2015 UTC,"I like the Shelton pick at 1.13. As a Saints fan from Los Angeles I watch quite a bit of Pac-12 football and I agree, he's a solid pick. Tough and aggressive, just the type of player we need on the interior of the defensive line to get to the quarterback and help stuff the run game."
Saints,30nqvy,neovenator250,3,Sun Mar 29 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"I like Shelton at 13, especially when Dupree is the top pass rusher available. Dupree is still raw, and while I wouldn't mind him at 13, there are other good pass rushers in the draft, like Kikaha.   Shelton, however, is the only NT in the draft aside from maybe Malcom Brown that I would expect to come in and immediately take the starting job."
Saints,30nqvy,neovenator250,0,Sun Mar 29 05:31:29 2015 UTC,Dupree isn't a pass rusher though.
Saints,30nqvy,harveyfjord,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:09:40 2015 UTC,He would be for us. And he probably would be for any team that drafts him.
Saints,30nqvy,Bouzal,5,Sun Mar 29 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"I think some may question passing on Dupree for Shelton. I was one of the ones who advocated Shelton. I'm not quite sold on Dupree as a top 15 guy, and we knew there would be good pass-rushers available with our next two picks while top NT talent drops off big time.   Agree wholeheartedly.  Dupree is a reach, IMO.  I don't think we should be locked into taking a pass rusher at 13 no matter what.  Why take the 5th (?) best pass rusher when you can get a higher rated player at another position?"
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,3,Sun Mar 29 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"I like it a lot except for the Hundley pick.  I don't think he's worth taking in Round 3, let alone trading up for.  I'd frankly be surprised if the Saints took a QB at all, unless someone drops to us in Round 5 or 6 that wasn't expected to be there.  Question: did you guys trade out of #31 during the draft after Green Bay took Kendricks at #30?  or did that deal happen earlier?"
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,2,Sun Mar 29 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"I explained my logic for the Hundley pick a few comments up. I see him as a 3rd rounder, but in this draft class, I don't think he falls out of round 2.   I wasn't there for the first round, so someone else will have to answer the Kendricks question."
Saints,30nqvy,DoctorWhosOnFirst,2,Sun Mar 29 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, Kendricks being already gone was a factor in the decision to trade down.  I think one of the saints drafters was discussing trading up to get him with some other managers, but all the deals we were offered to do so were too costly."
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:41:27 2015 UTC,"For the value in this mock, the hundley pick is great. I personally would love Grayson or Petty a bit later in the real draft"
Saints,30nqvy,DoctorWhosOnFirst,2,Sun Mar 29 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Good draft other than that trade at 31. We traded back 8 spaces for a 4th rounder since the third rounder swap was meaningless value wise.   Edit: and the more that I look at the roster, the more I've come to realize that we just cannot afford to use a draft pick for a luxury like QB. We need at the bare minimum two OL, 3 DL, 2 LBs, and a receiver this draft. That's not even counting drafting starters. That's just drafting for depth."
Saints,30nqvy,Twistify804,7,Sun Mar 29 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"We need at the bare minimum two OL, 3 DL, 2 LBs, and a receiver this draft.   This draft plan would be suicide. If we lock ourselves into quotas for positions, we would basically be handcuffing ourselves for the entire draft.   We have to be able to pounce on value picks when we can. It's pretty well known that the most successful teams draft BPA instead of drafting solely based on needs. The Patriots drafted a QB in the 2nd round last year, and they won the Super Bowl. They're also much better prepared for Brady's inevitable retirement, which isn't all that closer than Brees'."
Saints,30nqvy,Brees2Graham,3,Sun Mar 29 03:17:18 2015 UTC,"I think making luxury picks like drafting a QB when we have massive holes in a bunch of areas to address is suicide, but to each their own.   And we're not in the same boat as New England. We are coming off a losing season and we've had losing records two of the last three seasons. When was the last time New England had a losing season? And we've traded three starters and in cap hell to the point that we couldn't add depth through free agency. New England wasn't in cap hell when they drafted a QB."
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,3,Sun Mar 29 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"The massive holes were addressed, though.  ILB, pass-rusher, guard, NT, and CB were all taken before Hundley.  Things like a back-up OT can be had at the end of Day 3."
Saints,30nqvy,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:22:16 2015 UTC,"One OT doesn't fix our line depth, and why draft one at the end of Day 3 when we could get a better one earlier in the draft?"
Saints,30nqvy,DoctorWhosOnFirst,3,Sun Mar 29 03:23:56 2015 UTC,"We also drafted a guard in the 3rd to compete with Lelito and Kelemente.  Unger, Evans, Armstead, and Strief are set at the other four spots.    I agree another OT should be added; but you shouldn't be drafting back-up OT depth too early.  Getting the 3rd best QB in this class at the end of the 3rd is great value, and all it cost us was our second 5th rounder.  It still left us with three more picks."
Saints,30nqvy,Brees2Graham,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:34:09 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what you said at the end, the value of Hundley in the back of 3rd is too good to pass up. He has the potential to be one of the best QBs in the NFL with time to develop, and I think picking him right there would be best in the long run."
Saints,30nqvy,ashsky,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"Why do you not like the trade? Kendricks was gone and we were fairly certain one of Anthony, Dawson or even McKinney would be there 8 picks later. We probably would have ended up taking one of those guys at 31 anyway. So for basically nothing we got to move up in the 3rd and got a free 4th we could either pick with or use as currency."
Saints,30nqvy,SoUnderrated,-1,Sun Mar 29 05:14:10 2015 UTC,"Don't think we got enough in return. It's a user mock so it's not a big deal, but if the Saints make that trade then I'd be pissed."
Saints,30nqvy,whodat951,3,Sun Mar 29 05:18:57 2015 UTC,"According to the trade value chart, we gave up an 815 point value and received an 827 point value, and we got the guy we would have taken anyway."

Saints,30mp2u,whodat951,6,Sat Mar 28 20:05:57 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the Evans restructuring is to free up money to sign draft picks. We need like $5m in cap space to sign the picks we currently have.
Saints,30mp2u,Saints2Death,2,Sat Mar 28 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"I know. I'm just very concerned out our O-line (particularly the depth) and would sleep a lot better with a new right guard and Lelito as depth. I would love to see one more free agent signing this offseason, and with Mason Foster finally signed with the Bears, Wisniewski is the only person left on my wish list."
Saints,30mp2u,sfzen,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"I would rather spend our money on defensive help, or a WR. I think, when you consider the price tag, we're just as well off starting Lelito at OG and/or drafting someone. Don't forget, even though he wasn't up to scratch as a starting C last year, the whole reason we let De la Puente go was because Lelito did well enough at OG the year before that we felt comfortable relying on him."
Saints,30mp2u,neovenator250,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:26:26 2015 UTC,Don't know that he offers enough for it to be worth it.  Guard is almost certainly going to be addressed in the draft.
Saints,30mszl,bearcam,2,Sat Mar 28 20:39:29 2015 UTC,"To me, the most important move is to find out how to get the maximum result out of our current players. On paper, I think we have a top 5 roster. It's up to our coaches to get our players to play at their maximum potential."
Saints,30mszl,Lokipokie504,3,Sat Mar 28 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Right now it's nail the draft and grab quality UDFA. Our roster is incredibly shallow at almost every position, and we need to get as many young bodies as we can on both lines, LB and receiver."
Saints,30mszl,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:49:13 2015 UTC,Drafting players who are productive for us at need positions
Saints,30nopu,Simplename64,6,Sun Mar 29 01:19:04 2015 UTC,"I think we're fine with back up QBs. If we grab one, it should be an UDFA. There is too many positions where we need immediate depth and a project QB is just not that important.   Edit for Clarification about depth (not considering drafting immediate starters):   We need to draft at least 1 receiver and possibly a receiver and a tight end. Colston is the only person with significant playing time and Cooks is the only other receiver/tight end that's ever started for us recently. (Watson was a starter years ago.)  We need to draft at least two offensive linemen, but three would be better. Lelito is the only quality backup we have, and he's projected as the starter unless we draft a guard high. Kelemete and Harris have struggled in limited snaps.   We need three defensive linemen. Jenkins and Bunkley are both coming off injury, and neither are what you call world beaters. Glen Foster is the only back up defensive end we have.  We need at least 1 ILB and 1 OLB. This is on top of the projected edge rusher most people have us drafting high,  Not a high priority, but we could use depth at corner. Our starting corners are set, and we have a lot of bodies on the roster all with huge question marks. Grabbing a quality corner high might not be a bad thing.   By my count that's 8 must draft and 12 we could really use. I don't understand how people are projecting us to take a QB at all in this draft."
Saints,30nopu,Saints2Death,0,Sun Mar 29 01:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think he is worth the shot. He is a late round prospect who has the potential to play like Russell Wilson. We have a total of nine picks, so burning one on Sims wouldn't kill us."
Saints,30nopu,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"Look at the roster and say that. By my count 8 of our picks are must drafts in positions other than corner and 12 would be a more accurate count. As it stands right now, we are by far the team lacking the most depth and QB depth is just not a priority."
Saints,30nopu,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"Our 5 round community mock draft got a QB (Hundley, who I have no problem with) at round 3, but traded to get even more picks. As you can see, it's not impossible to draft most of our needs in 5 rounds and still have enough room to draft a QB. However, I think we shouldn't spend an early pick on a QB, that's why I want Sims- because he is projected to be a late round pick."
Saints,30nopu,neovenator250,2,Sun Mar 29 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Again, I don't think we have the luxury to spend any picks on QB, Hundley or Sims. We have a serious depth issue."
Saints,30nopu,flordeliest,3,Sun Mar 29 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"No.  Flat out no.  I wouldn't be opposed to him as an UDFA.  Don't like him as a pick, frankly.  Go elsewhere with the bigger investments."
Saints,30nopu,brandonie187,2,Sun Mar 29 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Undrafted free agent. Maybe.
Saints,30nopu,cfiggis,2,Sun Mar 29 03:14:39 2015 UTC,Sims has a very boom or bust future. He would definitely be a fun pick up as an UDFA.
Saints,30nopu,harveyfjord,1 point,Sun Mar 29 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is opportunity cost. Sure, having a QB sit behind Brees is nice, but that sort of fruit won't ripen for 3-4 years once Brees retires. And by then a QB's rookie contract would be over half done.  We have needs on this team right now, this season. Let's start looking at QBs when we need a QB. Right now we're a 7-9 team, and stashing players for 3-4 years in the future is a luxury we can not afford."

Saints,30leie,Acipere,7,Sat Mar 28 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"We defy the analysts yet again by making sensible and unexciting picks. Really, we do a good job of filling gaps with combine studs rather than grab big name talent. Besides Mark Ingram and Reggie Bush, I think we shy away from spotlight players"
Saints,30leie,theplayerpiano,3,Sat Mar 28 12:55:39 2015 UTC,"If you draft a big name and he is a bust, that is a major setback for the organization.      If you spend a plethora of later round picks and get some decent talent and maybe even a breakout star, you didn't invest that 1st rounder."
Saints,30leie,Arkaynine,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:14:16 2015 UTC,Yeah football doesn't need that much star power like basketball. If you have a solid team with some superstars you can win a championship. It doesn't take a dream team. The Saints are proof of that.
Saints,30leie,VegasSaint9,3,Sun Mar 29 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"Utah Jazz is my NBA team, and that whole mindset has definitely been one of the things that has kept us from winning a championship. (That and Michael fucking Jordan.) They never go for big names, or if they do, they immediately trade them away. There's this joke among Jazz fans that every star player in the NBA was drafted by the Jazz in the first round. (Obviously not even close to true, but it's a joke.) They seem entirely opposed to having star players. They have 'good' teams, with 'good' players, but thy always skip by or throw away the possible 'great' players to avoid the focus on two or three guys instead of the team as a whole. It's been mildly irritating."
Saints,30leie,GenrlWashington,1 point,Sat Mar 28 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"I think that's an effect that's more pronounced in basketball, due to the 5 on 5 nature of the game, with the same players playing offense and defense.  In football, one star player is still 1 out of 11 on the field, and only playing half the game (or less, counting special teams). So you need consistency all around.  but with basketball, a star player is 20% of your team on the court for both offense and defense. So, it it could be worth it to go for that truly exceptional player."
Saints,30leie,cfiggis,6,Mon Mar 30 22:45:35 2015 UTC,Biggest surprise of the draft for us would be taking a QB in the first round.  Biggest surprise for the draft overall would be the Bucs not taking a QB in the 1st and sticking with Glennon.

Saints,30leie,Saints2Death,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:01:50 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest surprise would be not drafting another CB. Brandon Browner is big and fancy, but as he gets on in age we can't expect him to be useful for too many years. If we didn't select another big corner like Jaylen Collins to train under Lewis and Browner that would be a surprise. He could even be a physical presence on some 3rd and long scenarios."
Saints,30leie,bearcam,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:22:27 2015 UTC,"The way things are going according to the ""experts"" it'll be a shock if we don't draft Marcus Mariota. Otherwise, drafting an O-Lineman in the 1st round. We don't need a guy to come and start right away (unless the Saints don't feel like Leito can start) we need depth there. Just about anything else would be reasonable and logical."

Saints,30jlo3,Bcpouli,8,Sat Mar 28 01:59:50 2015 UTC,"I personally don't really like him. He was like the 3rd or 4th best CB at LSU. He would be a decent project, but not at the spot he'll likely be drafted."
Saints,30jlo3,Lokipokie504,2,Sat Mar 28 00:41:52 2015 UTC,"And don't we already have one ""project"" CB on the roster? Only way I could see us finding use for him is if we move him to safety, but I don see that happening at all."
Saints,30jlo3,Megawatts19,5,Sat Mar 28 08:25:43 2015 UTC,"I really hope someone grabs him before us, because he not that great. He has good size, but he was the weak link on LSU's secondary in big games."

Saints,30iurh,pottersquash,12,Fri Mar 27 20:29:51 2015 UTC,"I kind of realized I was a Saints fan when I realized they were the only team I root for to win no matter what and that the happiest I've been after a Super Bowl (ever) was the year the Saints won. Although I grew up in Oklahoma and will always be a Sooner, my family is from Saints territory. That's why my grandfather rooted for the Saints since they were founded. My aunt was born in NOLA while my dad's family lived there when my grandfather went to Tulane. Plus I'm a huge Deuce McAllister fan ever since OU lost to him and Ole Miss in the 1999 Independence Bowl. He was incredible that game and I loved seeing him go to the Saints. Then, in 2005, they drafted my old high school teammate in the first round, so that helped too.    When Katrina hit, I was in the Oklahoma Army National Guard and had just reported for a mission to Iraq. The mission only required 152 of the 300+ men who were in the battalion. I was one of the 152. The others (most of whom were DQ'd from overseas service due to some brokedick medical thing) were immediately called up and sent to NOLA while we got ready for combat. A part of me really wanted to help with the recovery, but I was being sent to Iraq instead. I'm not sure how much good the National Guard did there anyway, though. From the stories I heard, it seems like they just raised tensions even more. Then several hundred of the displaced Katrina survivors were sent to Camp Gruber, Oklahoma for housing. I felt so bad for them. They'd just lost everything, and then they'd been sent to the Oklahoma Army National Guard base that every Guardsman hated. It was built in the run-up to WWII and every expense was spared. Later, it housed German POWs. All the housing was concrete open bay barracks with no air conditioning. I guess I just felt a kinship with them to begin with because of my family ties there and then I heard they were sent to the same hellhole I'd spent time at.    Due to training for the Iraq mission (and the actual Iraq mission), I didn't get to follow the 2005 season much at all, but I really wanted the Saints to do well for the fans and residents of that city. Plus, my high school teammate was starting on the OL, so that was cool. I didn't get to follow the 2006 season very much either because we were still in Iraq, but we got to see some games on AFN. We started a fantasy football league to help pass the time, but we never got to see stats in real time. My memories of the 2006 season are basically just checking box scores on the shitty internet in Baghdad. Sadly, I didn't even see the Steve Gleason blocked punt until years later on YouTube (which also was new when I got back). It's one of the biggest plays in Saints history and I was probably asleep in Baghdad without knowing anything about it.   Every season since then, I've found myself rooting for the Saints over everyone else. For the longest time, I said I wasn't rooting for anyone in the Super Bowl; I just wanted a good game. Then the Saints made it, and I told everyone it was the first time I felt invested in one of the teams and would be rooting hard for the Saints. I jumped up and down so hard when Tracy Porter took that INT back to win the Super Bowl. I guess I don't know why it took so long to realize which team was ""mine."" It seems pretty obvious now."

When I first was exploring the NFL, I called the radio guys on the local sports station and asked them to suggest a team to cheer for that was from a smaller city in the NFL (like Edmonton is), and wasn't too highly represented up here (so not the Packers, Patriots, Seahawks or Broncos). They told me to check out the Saints, and I did just that. This was during the bountygate year so I was just getting a feel for things, and the Saints were all over the news at the time so it was easy to learn more about them. What I liked most was how they emerged as a really charismatic team right after Katrina, and I felt Drew Brees was a very likeable person, so I went with it and don't regret my decision for a second.  By sheer coincidence, one of my best friends was also a Saints fan (albeit for much longer than I had been), so I even had someone to discuss the team with. It's been a pretty good ride so far.

Saints,30iurh,runfastgodspeed,2,Sat Mar 28 07:16:23 2015 UTC,"I ignored most of football for a very long time. I lived in Indiana, we had shit for teams. Notre Dame was essentially a door mat (I was young, I could be wrong). People talked glory days but whatever. Purdue however was getting press for a hot QB prospect, Drew Brees (he shared my first name).  Curious, I asked my parents if I could see this guy and possibly meet him. Sure enough, we drove to Purdue (the car ride took forever) and upon arrival of the Purdue campus it was hard NOT to see Brees. Shit he was everywhere.  My parents asked around and finally we found him on the field throwing footballs downfield. That was where I met him, he wasn't too tall now when I think about it but then again I was the weight of a triple decker ham sandwich and maybe the size of a yard stick at that point. He smiled, said some inspirational stuff like ""Work hard and success will come and find you."" and went back to practice.  I was pretty much a Purdue football fan after that and followed him for a while. Life got complicated, I fell out of football but I remembered him forever.  Years later, I'm watching the Bears play the Saints in 2006 for the championship and I hear Drew Brees' name while I'm off killing Nazi's in Day of Defeat. I quit the game immediately, run into the other room and ask which team Brees is playing on. My dad, who was half watching it says the Saints and I immediately became glued to the set.  That was one of the most spectacular games I watched and it was then that I got more and more involved with Football and more and more involved with the Saints. I love this team now, win or lose, because we have some of the coolest rivalries (None of that NFC East Hate where it's scorched earth. We treat it like comic book villains.) and best stadium in the league. How many teams can say ""Oh yeah, my Stadium withstood a Hurricane?"""

I got really into football watching them that year, and watched as they went all the way to win the Superbowl.

Saints,30hrrd,PatSayJack,13,Fri Mar 27 14:18:53 2015 UTC,"We might be able to get him cheaper if we sign him this year because of his ""down"" performance last year.  I hope Jordan stays a Saint and bounces back next year. Maybe some of his problems last year were a result of an ineffective secondary and lack of pass rush up the middle."
Saints,30hrrd,EternalWitness,8,Fri Mar 27 15:07:59 2015 UTC,when Rob was working the 3-4 tech it really helped Cams game. 3-4 needs DBs who are great at covering down the field to give the rushers time to get to the QB and what we really lacked last year were DBs who are able to shut down wide recievers. What I'm hoping for is for the Saints to grab maybe Trae Wayne's or Marcus Peters with the first pick to really help out at corner.
Saints,30hrrd,ohhgod,8,Fri Mar 27 15:24:53 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Cam's lower production definitely has to do with the lack of coverage sacks. DEs need time to get past the OT, but if the receivers are wide open (looking at you, Saints secondary) the QB can easily get rid of the ball before Cam can get to him.  Lots of sports media are saying pass rushers will be a priority in our draft, but honestly, good CBs will solve both our pass rushing and pass coverage problems."
Saints,30hrrd,Beardycitrus,3,Fri Mar 27 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, I get that QBs had open receivers, but I think the main problem was no pass rush up the middle. Dudes were just chillin' in the pocket for days, and though our DBs were terrible they had nothing to do with that."
Saints,30hrrd,paradigmshift7,2,Fri Mar 27 19:34:03 2015 UTC,"But that's the thing with a 3-4 defence though. Having only 3 D linemen means less consistant pressure on the quarterback unless you dedicate a linebacker to pass rushing on almost every play. 3-4 should be a flexible formation that can have more players help with coverage. Meaning more time in the pocket for the qb as a downside.  You're right about the lack of pressure down the middle though. Losing Lofton was a big hit and I don't think Hawthorne or Ellerbe are gonna be able to fully replace him.   I dunno. I'm just thinking out loud and haven't even been watching the NFL for long (European fan, watching since the Ravens-Niners superbowl). But I'm really excited about the way this off season is going and fully trust we'll be a better team next season. Geaux Saints!"
Saints,30hrrd,Beardycitrus,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"Yup. I remember them putting a timer on the opposing QB and he had 8 seconds from snap to pass. That's an eternity in the pocket. Even after 8 seconds, there was still no developing pressure."

He could easily catch 70+ passes this year and with his big play ability, that could be a huge difference in how teams have to gameplan.   He's the perfect dump off/outlet back for Drew. Buffalo never used him right.   ""So we got a guy whose best skills are maximized in open space? Let's run iso and power plays up the middle with him. What's the worst that could happen?""  I'm excited. If he stays healthy(which is more possible since he most likely won't take the beating he did in Buf.) He could have a career year. I mean he hasn't really missed that many games anyways. He missed about 45% of last year, but other than that it's only been about a game or two per season.

Saints,30e7i9,jjuneau86,20,Thu Mar 26 17:38:05 2015 UTC,I liked what I saw from him every time he was on the field last year. I think he'll do a fine job.
Saints,30e7i9,kweeche,2,Thu Mar 26 17:57:55 2015 UTC,Yep. He made some great catches last year. He'll fill in nicely.
Saints,30e7i9,makeplayz,3,Thu Mar 26 17:59:52 2015 UTC,I think he'll have a breakout year because other defenses won't direct their focus on him. Graham had his breakout year because he put himself in a position to out-athlete linebackers. Once he drew the attention to himself as Brees's favorite target the defenses learned to put their top corners on him. I see Hill becoming a solid security blanket for Brees but it remains to be seen whether that lasts across seasons.
Saints,30e7i9,IAteTheFridge,2,Fri Mar 27 20:24:47 2015 UTC,What is your expectations of a break out year for Hill?
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,2,Fri Mar 27 20:27:37 2015 UTC,That's a great question actually. I see him getting his main receptions on third downs and on red zone mismatch type situations. I'm gonna say ~700 yards and 8 touchdowns which to me puts him as a solid player because defenses won't be able to guess his role in the play before the snap.  I remember a td reception he had last season where he was left wide open in the red zone and Brees lobbed it to him by the sideline. He easily reeled it in and ran it in for a touchdown. Those are the situations I see him being used for - catching the defense off guard.
Saints,30e7i9,IAteTheFridge,3,Fri Mar 27 20:40:24 2015 UTC,So you think he'll go from a year removed from the practice squad in 2013 to a Top 10 TE in the NFL his first year as a starter?   You realize that's 100 yards and 2 TDs less than what Graham did in 2014.
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:42:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree it sounds a little ridiculous so I think I'll scale the yardage down to ~500. But that's how I envision his ceiling being for next season. Maybe a Jeremy Shockey type role? Coby Fleener had 774 yards 8 TDs last season for comparison. Depth at the tight end level is not great.
Saints,30e7i9,IAteTheFridge,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"8 TDs is still a lot. Only 6 TEs had 8 or more including, Gronk, Thomas, Graham, Gates, Fleener and Dwayne Allen.  And Fleener and Dwayne Allen both played for Indy, so they got 1,100 yards and 16 TDs out of the TE position since they split time."
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:00:32 2015 UTC,He's also going to line up opposite of Ben Watson on 2 TE sets (goal line plays?) and his role is also cryptic - reliable hands and a fantastic run blocker.
Saints,30e7i9,IAteTheFridge,2,Fri Mar 27 20:42:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I like to hear!  As much as I loved JG, I hated how that was such a big hole in his game.  It made what he excelled at way too predictable."
Saints,30e7i9,didntevenwarmupdho,12,Thu Mar 26 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"He definitely can block which makes our offense that much better, with JG you can almost guess 80% that it was going to be a pass play."
Saints,30e7i9,didntevenwarmupdho,3,Thu Mar 26 18:51:12 2015 UTC,How many times did we as couch coaches know who the ball was going to when JG lined up to the outside in the Redzone?  Show of hands?

Saints,30e7i9,Lokipokie504,2,Fri Mar 27 14:04:03 2015 UTC,NFL.com mirror: Wk 16 Can't-Miss Play: Graham crumbles and fumbles
Saints,30e7i9,Lokipokie504,2,Fri Mar 27 14:05:53 2015 UTC,Several things. Colston was wide open. Graham was double covered.  Graham jumped in midair and did a body catch which led to the poor ball security.  Last season was full of frustrating moments like this.
Saints,30e7i9,AGQ-,7,Fri Mar 27 20:29:15 2015 UTC,"Josh Hill will make our offense much more well rounded. His ability to block will keep defenses much more honest throughout the game, opening up the field for Drew to distribute the football."
Saints,30e7i9,Whipplashes,3,Thu Mar 26 19:35:00 2015 UTC,I'm hoping you're right.  A team with our passing superiority paired up with what I believe now is a true ability to ground and pound when needed should cause immeasurable chaos for opposing defenses.  Whereas before it was passing to open running I see this as a chance to have both the run and pass be complimentary of each other.
Saints,30e7i9,AGQ-,5,Thu Mar 26 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Our receivers never really looked open the last 2 years because of our lack of a running game. Teams were able to focus on the pass. Our big play was all but gone, and it was becoming harder for Drew to distribute evenly, which is what our offense is predicated on. Josh Hill is not as good as Jimmy in the receiving threat category, but he's much better than shockey was, when we had the best offense in the league. He's a good blocker, and our play action will become much more effective because of it."
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:53:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I'd have to go back to the years we had Deuce for me to really say we had a dominant rushing team.  I do see that changing this year after the recent contracts of Ingram and Spiller along with the philosophy of upgrading our O-line.  All of that combined, this offense has serious potential to be number 1 in both rushing and passing, and it may be the year Brees earns his MVP."

Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,5,Fri Mar 27 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"He can block better than Graham, but he's not a complete tight end by any stretch."
Saints,30e7i9,BigEasyGreg,4,Thu Mar 26 20:09:22 2015 UTC,Sounds like he'll have plenty of first team reps to up his game.  Should help tons.
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,3,Thu Mar 26 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be able to give us average receiving production (around 500 yards and 6 or 7 TDs) and he'll definitely be a better blocker than Graham, but we need to curb expectations or he's going to end up with a Corey White/Joe Morgan reputation."
Saints,30e7i9,aimerj,3,Thu Mar 26 20:47:30 2015 UTC,"I pulled this from The Who Dat Dish.  ""The 6-foot-5 Hill saw 293 snaps in 2014 with the majority of them as a blocker.  In 83 total snaps as a potential target for Drew Brees, Josh Hill reeled in almost 17 percent of those pass plays.  He had 14 receptions to be exact with five going for touchdowns, taking away scores from Graham.""  Considering this is what he did in limited action, I think your projection may be on the lower end of what we could potentially see from this guy."
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,5,Thu Mar 26 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll be anywhere close to that productive in the redzone without Jimmy Graham, who is one of the biggest redzone threats in football history, in the lineup. Defenses aren't going to game plan for Graham any more so that means Hill won't be as open in situations like this.   People are expecting pro bowl production out of a guy who is a season removed from the practice squad.   Yes, Hill can be a good player for us, but we need to be realistic here. There's a reason why he went undrafted and spent 2013 on the practice squad and there's a reason why he was a back up in 2014 and only saw 293 snaps. He's never started a game in two seasons, and people are already expecting Top 10 TE production out of him."
Saints,30e7i9,aimerj,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:59:19 2015 UTC,Hull had 5tds last year on only 14 receptions.  He was tied with Coleston for 3rd in tds.  For perspective JG had 10 with like 10X more receptions.
Saints,30e7i9,aimerj,2,Fri Mar 27 02:05:51 2015 UTC,"He was also playing opposite Jimmy Graham and was an afterthought to the defenses. As the No. 1 TE, that's not the case. Our fullbacks are also good for 3 or 4 TDS a season on relatively small amount of targets, but that doesn't mean one of them could have replaced Sproles after we traded him last season."
Saints,30e7i9,Saints2Death,2,Fri Mar 27 02:21:56 2015 UTC,Actually JG was only lined up opposite Hill for 1 of his 5 TDs last year.
Saints,30e7i9,aimerj,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"But I'm pretty sure Graham for on the field every one of the 5 TDs, just sometimes split wide."

In goal line situations Graham would stay in the game and Watson and Hill would play a traditional TE slot mainly for blocking.   I'll humor the situation that Graham wasn't in the game in a goal line situation, but EVERYONE knows when Graham isn't in the game, it's because it's almost always a running attempt. It was the biggest tell in football. Without Graham, that tell doesn't exist."

Sean Payton said he was looking for players that are highly motivated and nothing says you arnt into it like being a NFL Rookie who fails a drug test before even being drafted. It shows you don't care for league & team policies.
Saints,30f7fd,ohhgod,2,Fri Mar 27 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"We need another edge rusher. We have to put pressure on Matt Ryan and we need athleticism to contain Cam. If he falls to the second I'd have no problem taking him at 44.   I feel like our two biggest needs are OLB and MLB. OL could be thrown in there too but trading for Unger patched up our OL big time, so I dont feel it's as much of a need.   EDIT: My brain thought he was a DT..."

The dude is a time bomb waiting to explode right now and could easily go off at any point which is exactly not what we want when we have a small time frame to work with. He is extremely talented but is it worth the risk? Especially with a #13 pick and I don't see us bombing as hard as we did last season to get such a good pick.  Have to remember, we have got rid of troublesome players in the past and even recently with Stills so I don't know if we'd take a chance on it. Then again, we brought in people like Browner and Unger for ""leadership"" to maybe change that.  I do not see us taking him at 13 though, too much of a risk for the reward. He could easily be the next Josh Gordon and it's not what we need right now so later on at maybe 31 or 2nd? If he falls sure I guess, but not worth 13 when there is other great talent who don't come with baggage."

Saints,30f7fd,sfzen,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"This is what he has to say for himself.  Obviously it should be taken with a grain of salt, and I don't know enough about marijuana testing and all that to comment on the whole thing of ""last smoked in December, but the THC levels were so elevated it still showed up on the test"" thing, but it sounds to me like the guy at least understands the situation he's in. I think with a solid support system around him, especially since he's already going to be in stage 1 of the league's substance abuse program and has Herm Edwards openly approaching him as a mentor, he should get himself on the right track.  There are guys I would rather take at 13 based solely on on-field performance and expectations, but if the Saints like him enough as a player to take him at 13, I wouldn't be upset at all.  Of course, I wouldn't complain if this drops him to 31, either..."

I feel some teams may take this the wrong way like he's gonna be the next josh Gordon and they could pass. But a lot of teams have pass rushers as a premium part of their defenses and although Gregory is still somewhat raw, he has the size and speed to develop into a good to great pass rusher either at the OLB or DE.  It's just a character judgement call at this point, it could make him fall but most likely will be selected before 13."

There's 5 great pass rushers and there's a big drop off to Bud Dupree (as a pass rusher). Gregory versatility makes him as valuable to teams looking for a 4-3 DE or a 3-4 EDGE guy, so anyone looking for a pass rusher will look at him and there are more teams looking for pass rushers in the Top 12 than there are pass rushers available."
Saints,30f7fd,sfzen,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:11:15 2015 UTC,"I could see him falling out of the top 10 because of it, but that's largely in part to the other crazy talented pass rushers slated to go in the top 10. I don't think there's any chance he falls past Houston at 16."

I just can't see his falling out of top 10."
Saints,30f7fd,sfzen,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:23:43 2015 UTC,"Consider the other options, though. I don't think there's any way Leonard Williams falls out of the top 4. Winston goes #1, and Mariota will go in the top 10 as well. Then you've got guys like Cooper, White, Scherff, and possibly someone like Waynes who could go early. That's 3 sure-thing top 10 picks that aren't pass rushers, and then 3 or 4 more. Throw in the other elite pass rushers, and that's 11 or 12 guys total. There's a chance Gregory just isn't one of those top 10.  I think he'll probably go in the top 10, but I wouldn't be entirely shocked if he drops out."

Spiller is versatile in formation while not telegraphing what play is being run while he's in the game.  I think the primary reason Ingram got the yardage he did last year was because Khiry didn't produce like expected so he was limited and Thomas wasn't really healthy.

Saints,30bo8z,cfiggis,18,Thu Mar 26 04:26:20 2015 UTC,Thats like saying oh the Saints defense was bad so who cares if they had bounties. (Even though bountygate was complete bullshit)
Saints,30bo8z,VegasSaint9,-1,Thu Mar 26 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of we didn't gain anything from it so it wasn't that hard of a cheat.  A cheat is a cheat, so punish my team for doing that, but how is something that didn't even help us worth docking a 2nd round pick? The only way is they're making us out to be an example. I'm fine with that the reasoning, but the NFL isn't transparent.   The NFL is horrible at staying consistent. Jets & Pats were both tampering in the Revis case this year, Pats had deflategate and I highly doubt either of these cheats will see a punishment given.   Either way, Mr. Blank cheated & we'll deal with the consequences. Nothing for us fans to bitch and moan about. We still expect our team to improve next season and the seasons to come under Quinn."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,2,Thu Mar 26 14:26:04 2015 UTC,The fact that you didn't benefit from cheating doesn't mean the crime was less. It just means you're dumb for cheating in a way that had no outcome in the game.
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,-3,Thu Mar 26 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"It just means you're dumb.    You're the reason why Saints fans have a bad reputation among Falcons fans. Every time I try to have a decent conversation or clear the air on what's going on with our franchise, people like you use ignorance to shut down the discussion.    The fact that you didn't benefit from cheating doesn't mean the crime was less.   I didnt say that 1 bit. Read a little this time. With the wins not coming through, it means the cheating wasn't so drastic. If it was such a bad cheat, the other teams wouldn't have scored. That's not the case here. It was a weak cheat & deserves to be punished as so."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,5,Thu Mar 26 16:58:29 2015 UTC,That cheat was probably worth the 3 points you beat us by in week 1. Which is critically important due to the significance of a single win in the NFC South last year.
Saints,30bo8z,quantumhed,-3,Thu Mar 26 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"There's no way the noise is what caused the lost compared to Colston's fumble. When relating to the rest of the season, I doubt the noise really did anything. I watched every game and I didn't see a single time where noise was affecting the other teams communication. The noise was used to encourage fans to cheer since we were having such a terrible season."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,6,Thu Mar 26 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"Prove it didn't. That cheat was used to distract opposing offenses and that game came down to just a few plays. The noise could have been a factor, and because it's blatantly against the rules, there's no way that you could prove that the artificial noise didn't have a huge impact."
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,3,Thu Mar 26 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"Your entire argument is that because the Falcons were terrible, they shouldn't be punished as heavily as if they were good. Pumping in artificial noise would help the Falcons defense as much as it would help Seattle's defense. The problem is the Falcons defense was so bad that they couldn't take advantage of the benefit it provided.   Should a bank robber get less time if he loses the money during the get away as they do if they were caught with it? Should the robbers get more time if they were able to spend the money they stole over if they were caught before they spent it?   The crime is the same no matter what the outcome is."
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,-3,Thu Mar 26 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"No. So many fallacies, it's mind blowing.   My argument is it didn't affect the other team, so the cheat wasn't a bad one. Nothing to do with how the Falcons played.  You're comparing it to bank robberies when it's clearly not that serious. Use my example and make a judgment off of that assumption. Thievery is thievery, noise pumping is not ""robbing banks."""
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,3,Thu Mar 26 18:52:57 2015 UTC,How can you say it didn't affect the team? It could have affected the team and you still are terrible.  Edit: and it's call an analogy. You can't really think that I'm comparing the severity of robbing a bank to the severity of artificial crowd noise.
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,-2,Thu Mar 26 19:04:42 2015 UTC,Watch the games! When have you seen the opposing qb affected? Please show me.
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,5,Thu Mar 26 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"Time outs, inability to call audibles and hot routes, miscommunications and silent counts which negates advantages of offenses knows snap count and defenses not. That's just the obvious ones."

Saints,30bo8z,SoUnderrated,-4,Thu Mar 26 22:55:58 2015 UTC,Please show me the games where this actually was affected. I didn't see a single one.
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,4,Thu Mar 26 19:33:21 2015 UTC,There's a reason why artificial crowd noise is against the rule and the punishment should not be determined because a team is 0-16 or 16-0.
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,-2,Thu Mar 26 19:25:39 2015 UTC,"I don't understand that logic. Robbery is against the law, yet robbing a bank will give you more time than robbing a home. Possession of illegal drugs are illegal, yet a house full of Marijuana plants will get you more time than a pocket full of it.  There's severity of crimes that differentiate the punishments given. If we pushed out a 100 decibels, then take away all of our draft picks. If we only pushed out a few decibels, punish us accordingly. A 2nd round pick isn't punishing accordingly. I'm not asking for the NFL to go lightly on the Falcons. I'm asking for fairness."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"The argument can't really be made that it didn't help the Falcons, though.  I know your D was awful at home this year, but we can't know if it would've actually been worse had the crowd noise not been pumped in."
Saints,30bo8z,ImShadier,0,Thu Mar 26 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"True, but at the same time, it clearly wasn't a big factor in helping us win. There were games where we were actually playing good football. If the noise was really a factor, it would have got us to dominate in the games we were executing the plays. That never happened.  It can be lobbied up that the noise helped us from losing by a touchdown more, but it was never visible. The other teams never had issues with communication."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,2,Thu Mar 26 17:59:20 2015 UTC,"Good points, but it still remains that we don't have the information to definitively make the claim that it didn't help. It's a fair inference based on the reasoning you've given, though."
Saints,30bo8z,ImShadier,1 point,Thu Mar 26 18:23:04 2015 UTC,Not all cheats are God mode cheats. In fact most cheats only give teams slight advantages. All that means is the Falcons weren't good enough to take advantage of the cheats.
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,-2,Thu Mar 26 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"Stealing a snickers bar is different from stealing a car.  Both illegal crimes, different punishment.   Punish accordingly."
Saints,30bo8z,pnp_,2,Thu Mar 26 18:36:55 2015 UTC,Yes but pumping crowd noise in games that you lose is the same crime as pumping crowd noise in games that you win. Because you didn't take advantage of pumping crowd noise should have zero affect on the penalty.
Saints,30bo8z,Saints2Death,7,Thu Mar 26 18:44:38 2015 UTC,Isn't being the Falcons punishment enough...

Plus he can do some between the tackle running. Injuries worry me, but got to have faith in Saints medical staff (which is weird cause Pelicans medical staff is apparently run by 1st year interns). I just love that now when Sean decides to platoon sets, it won't be so obvious any more. Yes, Ingram is better runner than catcher, but he CAN catch. Spiller better catcher than runner, so he can run. One thing about the Jimmy/Sproles combination is you utterly knew the type of play based solely on personal. Smart D's counter that shit easily."

Saints,309vbi,ThatBoiiBryan,6,Wed Mar 25 17:33:06 2015 UTC,Greg Jennings and Wes Welker are the only two that come to mind. Both getting up there in age but Payton said Coleman & Jones (Seantavius?) would play a role next season so maybe it's another leadership move for the younger guys? Can't say for certain but any experienced WR would be an addition (as long as it's not expensive).
Saints,309vbi,ashsky,4,Wed Mar 25 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"We could use a downfield threat. Of the free agents I'm seeing batted around, Reggie Wayne seems like the best fit to me.  Plus he's a veteran respected player, so good for the locker room. But only at a cheap price, so who knows.  But here's the thing. Of course they talked. They would talk about a lot of possibilities, contingencies. That doesn't mean that this particular conversation is going to be acted upon. Just one of the many things discussed."
Saints,309vbi,cfiggis,4,Wed Mar 25 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"First off, let me start by saying that I'm a HUGE Reggie Wayne fan and would love to see him on the team for a very affordable deal. I really want for him to have another 2 seasons of at least decent production so that he can break into the top 3 all-time receivers IN TERMS OF STATS.   With that being said, Reggie isn't a down field threat like he once was. He longer has the speed to be that kind of player, and he clearly lost a step after his ACL injury 2 years ago. He relies on his fantastic route running to create any kind of separation since he just doesn't have the speed, explosiveness, or agility to create space otherwise.  If anything, Reggie is more of a possession receiver (In my eyes), as his route running is still impeccable and probably the best in the NFL to this day. He also might have the most disgusting fade route of all time which would be perfect with Drew's accuracy and ball placement.   The problem with this is that we already have an intermediate receiver in Colston, who's age, loss of speed, and constant foot injuries sort of restricts his effective range to about 15-25 yards down field. The other problem is that Reggie, as of the last 2-4 years, has worked extensively from the slot in 3-receiver sets (Again from what I've noticed), which is already largely occupied by Cooks.  Essentially, our deep passing game would be extremely limited UNLESS we use a specialist (Do we even currently have one?) or have a designed play that utilizes Cooks' insane speed and explosion to get down field, and even then it would pale in comparison to the vertical threat that we've enjoyed in the past. Wayne and Colston are too slow to get down field and Cooks' size is a disadvantage, although he does have an incredible ability to fight and even beat larger corners in jump-ball situations regardless of the height disadvantage.  Of course, the above paragraph is completely disregarded if our O-Line (Much improved with Unger if he's healthy) can buy Brees ample amounts of time ala 2009-2011. The extra time would allow Wayne or Colston the time to get down field and also allows Brees to eye-fuck the shit out of the safeties and create a hole in the secondary, which we all know just how good he is at doing.  Edit: Obviously, a good running game, which we finally have with Ingram, can also buy time with the option to run the play-action, in which case our slower receivers could make it down field. In the end, it's too early to tell how this will all play out, and who even knows if Wayne is even being considered by the FO."
Saints,309vbi,Jaul18,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:18:47 2015 UTC,"I agree accept for one thing: Payton relied on Robert Meachum. How is Reggie Wayne now/next year any different from Robert Meachum last year? If you are Payton, I think you figure Cooks can go deep, maybe you work out Saunders and let Wayne and Colston work the middle or ""Jimmy Zone."" Where smarts, and sure handedness are key. Saints do alot of short area specific routes decision to have Brees deliver the ball quickly for a 4-5 yard gain. Maybe you get a little YAC maybe you don't, but the completion needs to happen. Wayne gives you that.  Plus, you know he would go league minimum to finish off at home."

Saints,309vbi,Lokipokie504,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:57:56 2015 UTC,Guess my text didn't get included but anyways. I was assuming that this player was either Reggie Wayne or Greg Jennings. I believe it would be good to grab either one for depth and valuable leadership experience. Greg may have fallen off a bit with the Vikings but when he had Rodgers and Favre throwing to him he's been nothing but great. Reggie Wayne has had nagging injuries lately but he is still a decent receiver.
Saints,309vbi,sfzen,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"Free agent WR's that have been to a pro bowl: Miles Austin, Greg Jennings, Brandon Lloyd, Reggie Wayne, and Wes Welker.   It's probably an NFC guy, since until recently it was separated. I'm pretty confident that it's either Greg Jennings or Miles Austin. I would prefer Jennings, since he's less injury prone and seems like more of a veteran leader."
Saints,309vbi,Jaime-Foxx,2,Wed Mar 25 22:53:19 2015 UTC,He puts the team on his back doe
Saints,309vbi,dean815,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:19:14 2015 UTC,Not necessarily a wide receiver. Could be zach miller if they meant in the past as opposed to only this year. Could also be Rob Housler since the pro bowl was in AZ this year.

Saints,309e9x,kweeche,2,Wed Mar 25 17:03:16 2015 UTC,I love how there's a shitstorm of speculation regarding drafting Brees' replacement and Sean just ends it with two words. Brees is 100% serious about playing until he just can't offer anymore and drafting his replacement now is and always has been an absurd idea.
Saints,30a398,jffm114,5,Wed Mar 25 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Ideally and realistically, not projecting any trades, I would go with  1.13 Alvin Dupree DE/OLB  1.31 Eric Kendricks ILB  2.44 AJ Cann OG/C  A bit more realistically, it would probably look like  1.13 Alvin Dupree DE/OLB or Danny Shelton NT/DT  1.31 Stephone Anthony ILB or Marcus Peters CB  2.44 Laken Tomlinson OG or Breshaud Perriman WR"
Saints,30a398,sfzen,3,Wed Mar 25 19:49:35 2015 UTC,I agree 100% with your first scenario. That's my ideal scenario for our first 3 picks. However if Kendricks isn't available at 31 I'd like to take a WR(if there's one worthy) and then Dawson at 44.
Saints,30a398,Brees2Graham,3,Wed Mar 25 23:13:25 2015 UTC,"BPA, BPA and BPA. I think outside of QB and Safety, it wouldn't hurt to draft any position. Why reach for a position when you can just get the best player available."
Saints,30a398,Saints2Death,2,Wed Mar 25 19:52:59 2015 UTC,I think they'll be drafting the best player available. I expect there to be some moving around on draft day (based on past draft days with Peyton/Loomis). I'm willing to bet they covet someone in the top 10-15 and they may not be willing to gamble that who they covet will fall to 13.

Saints,30a398,sart0rial,0,Fri Mar 27 19:59:07 2015 UTC,"I guess it would all depend on who's available. Pass rusher at 13 to me is a no brainer (Fowler, Ray, Dupree, Gregory, or Beasley). Next would be all dependent on who's available, for example if someone like La'El Collins/Cameron Erving is sitting there at 31 I'd take them, if a WR like Perriman, Strong, or DGB is there then I'd take one of them, if not then I would take an ILB (Kendricks, Dawson, McKinney, Perryman, or Anthony). The 3rd round picks would cover the leftovers from the 2nd pick (i.e.  if we went ILB then they'd be WR/OL and vice versa.)"
Saints,30a398,ThatBoiiBryan,3,Wed Mar 25 18:35:19 2015 UTC,Perriman just posted a 4.26 40 on his pro day. Likely he'll move up just from that. DGB has some off the field issues I guess. I think with how this offseason is going Payton will try to avoid anything like that. I like everything else you're saying though.
Saints,30a398,xbaited,3,Wed Mar 25 20:18:14 2015 UTC,I hope Perriman does. Give us a a chance for a receiver that's actually good and not just fast.

Saints,30a398,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:52:39 2015 UTC,Is it because of game tape or something else? I personally haven't seen much on him which is why I ask
Saints,30a398,ThatBoiiBryan,3,Thu Mar 26 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"He has one of the highest drop rates of anyone in the draft and he is strictly a vertical threat.   Also, he played in the American Athletic Conference. You'd think someone who is 6'2, 209 pounds and is one of the fastest people ever to play in college football and would be one of the 10 fastest guys in the NFL would dominate against AAC teams.   Edit: Be weary of fast people who didn't dominate mediocre talent in college. The NFL Combine fastest 40 times are littered with sub 4.3 40 small school guys who didn't do anything in college and busted in the pros."

Yes he threw a few more interceptions than we would like, but that happens when your pocket crumbles like stale bread.   I think he has years left. We haven't seen the last 4,000yd 30+td season, and I think he still has some 5,000yd seasons in him."

Saints,305hqz,RadicalDreamer89,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:22:57 2015 UTC,This. If the defense can get him on the field I think Brees will continue to have great numbers.
Saints,305hqz,coyotealert,1 point,Wed Mar 25 13:57:58 2015 UTC,He did seem to lose a little bit on the deep pass last season when he did throw it. He is still deadly inside of 25-30 yards though. Nothing keeping him from being a top 5 QB for another few years.
Saints,305hqz,GenrlWashington,2,Wed Mar 25 05:02:53 2015 UTC,"People say he lost it on the deep pass, but again I attribute that to how little time he had in the pocket.

Saints,305hqz,BurnTheBacon,3,Wed Mar 25 06:15:23 2015 UTC,"when has Brees ever been a bonafide downfield thrower?  Since Purdue, he's excelled at 5-wide short passing game tearing defenses apart. The past 3 years the Saints have gotten lazy and gravitating to big explosive plays down the seams because it is the low hanging fruit with a 6'7"" inside receiver.  Problem with that is, for those 15+ yard routes, you've got to protect longer and with more bodies.  This has never been Brees' forte.  Get back to what he does best....short passing game out of the gun distributing the ball < 12 yard routes, stretching the defense horizontally while getting the ball to as many players as possible"

He's an all-around type like Kendricks, but not quite at his level. Late 1st to late 2nd. I'd go with Benardrick McKinney from Miss St. as the #3. He's a thumper, 3-4 ILB or 4-3 Sam OLB. I'd compare him to Brian Cushing. Probably a 2nd rounder, but he could sneak into the late 1st. I've got Denzel Perryman from Miami fourth. I'd say he's similar to McKinney, but slightly better in coverage, and not quite as much of a bruiser. McKinney is 6'4 while Perryman is 5'11. Could go anywhere from early 2nd to the 3rd round. I've got TCU's Paul Dawson at #5. He had a terrible combine, running a 4.9 in the 40, and he's got some character concerns. His tape is fantastic, though, and he might be the best coverage LB in the draft. Could go as early as the 2nd round, but depending on how scouts see him and his character stuff, I wouldn't be totally shocked if he falls to the early 4th.   3-5 are all pretty much interchangible, all probably going in the 2nd or 3rd.   Basically, I see it like this: Kendricks is the only almost-certain 1st rounder, then you've got Anthony, McKinney, Perryman, and Dawson in 2-4, and then everyone else is in that general mix of day 3 picks.  One name to watch is Shaq Thompson out of Washington. I was really, really high on him as an ILB in our 3-4, getting close to a top 10 pick. He measured in really small, at 6'0 and ~220 lbs. His tape is great, but he's a LB/S 'tweener. I really don't see him playing anything other than a Will OLB in a 4-3, but I wouldn't be totally shocked if we pounce on him at the end of the 1st or early 2nd to play as a nickel LB. If he were 15-20 pounds heavier, I'd have him right up there with Kendricks as the top LB's."
Saints,305frb,sfzen,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:17:32 2015 UTC,he might be the best coverage LB in the draft.   He does alright but he is nothing to harp about in coverage.
Saints,305frb,flordeliest,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:01:10 2015 UTC,"Dawson? Half of his highlight plays were picks and he showed great coverage awareness in almost every clip I've seen. Keep in mind, almost every other LB in the draft sucks in coverage. It's really between Dawson and Kendricks. And Thompson, if he counts."
Saints,305frb,sfzen,2,Tue Mar 24 21:03:15 2015 UTC,"That guy bases almost every one of his opinions on 40 times. If a LB had a fast 40, flordeliest likes them. If they had a bad 40, they suck."
Saints,305frb,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:42:48 2015 UTC,"Ints aren't really telling of coverage abilities. The one against WV is the Thicket was trying to throw the ball away, the receiver isn't even looking. The one against Texas should have been a flag, and he was blitzing on the pick six against Oklahoma. That is all three of his ints last season, minus the one against Samford, and none of those are telling of his coverage abilities. Besides disrupting some routes he is irrelevant in coverage, by the end of most close games he is delay blitzing on every passing down, with the exception of prevent Ds.    I don't know why Shaq Thompson can't be a 3-4 ILBs at 230ish there are a couple of starters in NFL that size now. I'm so tired of that cop-out. Or the phrase ""I don't like the hype"", that was valid when he was projected to go at about 12-19 range back in February,  but give a real answer now that he fell to the bottom of the first."
Saints,305frb,flordeliest,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"Thompson bulked up and only got to 228. His playing weight is reportedly under 220. That's pretty small. If he were to play as a 3-4 ILB, he would be dealing with a lot of blockers and getting beat up pretty regularly, and his frame would come with some big injury concerns."
Saints,305frb,sfzen,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:59:39 2015 UTC,Valid concern. If he can stay at 230ish he could turnout really well for the team that takes the risk. But at this point i guess we aren't in the risk taking position.
Saints,305frb,flordeliest,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"I basically see him as Roman Harper, but competent in coverage. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I just don't see how it fits with our defense. We would probably use him as a safety, and we just don't need another safety on the roster. I think he would be a great pick for a team that wants to use him as a 4-3 Will."
Saints,305frb,sfzen,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:13:31 2015 UTC,this is pretty much my order of preference on them.
Saints,305frb,neovenator250,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:19:50 2015 UTC,You have to remember that most rookies put on considerable mass when joining an nfl team. I could see Shaq easily putting on 20lb's without losing any quickness (Ray Lewis anyone?).
Saints,305frb,superduperpooperman,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:02:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he can put on a bit more weight, but he bulked up for the combine and only managed ~8 pounds. If he proves me wrong and buildes up to ~235, awesome, I'll take him as an ILB in a heartbeat. I don't think it will happen, though."
Saints,305frb,sfzen,1 point,Wed Mar 25 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Stephone Anthony. He has the size, speed and instinct to be an elite player. Kendricks and McKinney are more polished to play the Mike role, but in the long run I think Anthony has things that can't be taught."
Saints,305frb,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately none really seperated themselves from the pack or wowed me as to who is truly the best of the bunch, but if we got any of the 5 (Perryman, Kendricks, Dawson, McKinney, and Anthony) I'd be happy."
Saints,305ayc,Zakimus,11,Tue Mar 24 16:34:06 2015 UTC,"I believe Mariota will be a bust. If he's there, I hope they use the pick as trade bait and move down a bit."
Saints,305ayc,Lokipokie504,6,Tue Mar 24 16:57:04 2015 UTC,Why?  I'm curious to see your thoughts. I think the only way he'll be successful day one is in Philly. But a few years behind Brees could be what it takes for him to be great. If the Saints draft him i could see it being like Farve-Rodgers. But hopefully Brees won't leave New Orleans :P
Saints,305ayc,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Mar 24 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"System qb, weak arm, average accuracy."
Saints,305ayc,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Mar 24 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Chip Kelly really proceed that you don't need a top 5 QB to run a good offense, and maybe Mariota was just a product of that."
Saints,305ayc,Lokipokie504,0,Tue Mar 24 18:41:21 2015 UTC,Idt chip kelly is going to least long either
Saints,305ayc,haledann,3,Tue Mar 24 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"No way he falls that far, but I agree I think he will be a bust."
Saints,305ayc,GooWow,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:03:01 2015 UTC,"Idt so either. I was just going along with the discussion. Someone will either get him top 5, or trade up to top 5 for him"
Saints,305ayc,pottersquash,5,Tue Mar 24 18:34:00 2015 UTC,If the saints draft a qb it will be in the later rounds spending a high pick is a bit much for a guy who sits on the bench.
Saints,305ayc,MistaChopstix,5,Tue Mar 24 16:38:51 2015 UTC,Aaron Rodgers????????
Saints,305ayc,ashsky,6,Tue Mar 24 16:46:30 2015 UTC,Exactly. Sometimes talent allowed to mature in a no pressure environment with greatness produces greatness.
Saints,305ayc,MistaChopstix,7,Tue Mar 24 16:54:09 2015 UTC,Like bryce petty. He could fall to our 2nd round pick.
Saints,305ayc,SoUnderrated,2,Tue Mar 24 17:07:09 2015 UTC,Bryce Petty will be available in the 4th never mind the 2nd. We can delay picking a QB because after Mariota & Winston the drop of is so huge.
Saints,305ayc,djmcintyre,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:10:38 2015 UTC,Let's hope so.
Saints,305ayc,watchout4mikem,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:36:20 2015 UTC,Idk he's been moving up the big boards quickly after blowing his pro day out of the water. He's likely to go late 2nd or early 3rd
Saints,305ayc,Megawatts19,3,Wed Mar 25 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'd rather see em pick up a Garrett Grayson or Bryce Petty or someone similar in the fifth. Have 3 years behind Breesus to learn and develop and can be a suitable replacement when the time comes"
Saints,305ayc,xbaited,3,Tue Mar 24 16:53:53 2015 UTC,I think that's a good opportunity to drop back and get more picks.
Saints,305ayc,Jaime-Foxx,4,Tue Mar 24 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"I don't care how talented he is. If he's there in the first we should pass. We don't need a QB. If we drafted him, he would just sit on the bench. If we want another SB, we have other holes to fill that will be more valuable with that first pick."
Saints,305ayc,xbaited,3,Tue Mar 24 17:00:59 2015 UTC,The Patriots drafted a QB in the first second round last year and won the SB.
Saints,305ayc,viper9,3,Tue Mar 24 18:18:13 2015 UTC,I believe Jimmy Garoppolo was a 2nd round pick.
Saints,305ayc,xbaited,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry. I knew it was early. Thanks."
Saints,305ayc,Megawatts19,3,Wed Mar 25 14:23:41 2015 UTC,Patriots drafted a QB in the first round   Garoppolo was drafted 62nd overall (Round 2)
Saints,305ayc,xbaited,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:09:15 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. My bad.
Saints,305ayc,jace_supreme,2,Wed Mar 25 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"While that's true, their roster (especially on defense) was more complete than ours is now."
Saints,305ayc,makeplayz,2,Tue Mar 24 18:24:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. I am not opposed to drafting him if he falls to us. Although, I am opposed to trading up for him. It all depends on who is available. I would really like a pass rusher, but if no one is there then I personally don't see a problem with taking Mariota."
Saints,305ayc,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Mar 24 18:27:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see them taking a QB earlier than the 3rd round so Bryce Petty or Garrett Grayson could very well be there. I can sorta see Cooper/White falling to us depending on who gets drafted first, but we'll most likely draft defense first. Maybe Trae Waynes, but I could see us trading up for Vic Beasley."
Saints,305ayc,hrafnass,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:05:19 2015 UTC,"Vic Beasley wants to be a Falcon, I'm sure our FO knows that."

Saints,305ayc,baconlovr,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:35:06 2015 UTC,agreed. you go with every team to get to play in the nfl.
Saints,305ayc,ProfoundlyProfound,1 point,Wed Mar 25 06:15:36 2015 UTC,He won't fall to #13. He'll be taken by Tennessee.  End of convo.
Saints,305ayc,aimerj,7,Tue Mar 24 17:22:10 2015 UTC,I don't think the Titans will take him. We haven't seen the last of Mettenberger.
Saints,305ayc,ProfoundlyProfound,2,Tue Mar 24 17:45:00 2015 UTC,"Why? Mett didn't seem that bad and they have bigger issues than QB. If you're referring to that article today that Wisenhut said about him, that was some smokescreen bullshit to see if anyone is dumb enough to pull a Redskins and trade a million picks."
Saints,305ayc,xbaited,0,Tue Mar 24 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"I suspect that as well, but i think it's reasonable to consider they just might pick him up."
Saints,305ayc,ashsky,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:50:02 2015 UTC,"I have him going #2, but I also believe Chip trades Murray and Bradford and #20 for Mariota.  And if the draft was anything like FA, I might not be totally making this all up."
Saints,304q3w,jffm114,10,Tue Mar 24 13:49:13 2015 UTC,"I try not to think I know more about players than the FO. If they think they have their man and they want to move up, I'm totally ok with it. The draft is always hit or miss anyway. No one gets to the top being safe all the time!"
Saints,304q3w,Lokipokie504,8,Tue Mar 24 14:10:13 2015 UTC,Statistically speaking trading up is a terrible idea. Teams that draft well trade down whenever possible.
Saints,304q3w,TacoExcellence,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:47:48 2015 UTC,"This, thank you! Trading up in the first round, especially in the Top 10, never seems to work out for the team trading picks. Maybe package No. 31 with one of our 3rds if there's a guy we're high on in the middle of the draft, but for the lover of God, just be happy with No. 13."
Saints,304q3w,Saints2Death,5,Tue Mar 24 22:37:08 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad I'm not the only person that is upset we didn't throw the game against the Bucs. Not only would we have a pick in the top 7 or 8, but we would be before Atlanta and Tampa Bay would have fallen to 2nd or 3rd and missed out on Jameis.   And I completely agree with not trading up. Unless some great falls and we only have to give up a 5th or later this year or a 4th or later next year, I do not want us to make a move up. I wouldn't mind moving up a few spots from 31 to get Kendricks (to jump ahead of GB), but every other position (CB, OL, OLB) I feel like we'd be able to grab some one of equal value by staying pat at 31 also. And even then I don't think Stephone Anthony is that far behind EK talent-wise.   My hope is that Shane Ray falls because of his lackluster pro day and we take him at 13. Take Stephone Anthony at 31. Best CB available in the 2nd (Will be numerous options), and take the best guard and WR available in the 3rd (Marpet/Tomlinson/J. Miller @ G; Devin Smith/Coates/Algholor @ WR)."
Saints,304q3w,evtine,2,Tue Mar 24 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"It's not that you want to see your team lose, but that last game was crucial. No Bucs pick number one, we would have a shot at Beasley, or even Cooper/White if we wanted.  I would love to see Kendricks, Mckinney, or Perryman taken, but it seems Anthony is a very good fallback plan (if you even want to call it that, he's a great LB who is probably just underestimated in the draft)."
Saints,304q3w,aimerj,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"One of my best friends is probably the biggest Bucs fan on Earth and I live in Tampa, so no, I don't agree that we should have thrown the game. As for OP's not trading up, I completely agree. We need to get best player on our defensive board available with #13, then ILB with 31, depth on D in second or  WR/Guard."
Saints,304q3w,pottersquash,3,Tue Mar 24 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"If Amari Cooper falls out of top 5 I would not be opposed to moving to get him. Sadly, the way I see that likely works is a move with Falcons which is just to crazy to happen."
Saints,304q3w,Geaux,-7,Tue Mar 24 14:48:33 2015 UTC,"We aren't gonna be able to afford Colston, Cooks and Cooper. There are a lot of good linemen and backers that could be available at that time. We could also find a decent tight end at that position as well..."
Saints,304q3w,pottersquash,10,Tue Mar 24 15:03:10 2015 UTC,"Afford? Rookie deal! We can afford it! Question is do you sink those picks in a WR when you will likely be able to get a good CB and LB or OL sitting pat. Cooper just has that ""it"" to me and I am usually good about seeing ""it"" when it comes to WR. He has that desire to just go for the ball that you need. I haven't seen tape on the WV prospect people are raving about but for me Cooper and Winston are the only offensive players worth a top 20 pick."
Saints,304q3w,BootsBean,3,Tue Mar 24 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"By the time Cooks' rookie deal is ending, Colston won't be playing for us anymore.  Cooper is a potential long term elite ceiling WR."
Saints,304q3w,makeplayz,2,Tue Mar 24 15:06:54 2015 UTC,"Affording Cooper isn't even a concern, especially regarding Colston. Colston will be long gone when Cooper's rookie deal ends and he's getting paid, especially if we (hypothetically) picked up his 5th year option.  And we have a decent tight end, Josh Hill is gonna be pretty good. He's got great hands."
Saints,304q3w,sfzen,2,Tue Mar 24 15:06:15 2015 UTC,No tight end is going in the top 15. Maybe one will go in the first round
Saints,304q3w,Saints2Death,3,Tue Mar 24 17:50:34 2015 UTC,"At #13, there are so many options that we'll be fine taking BPA. The draft is pretty stacked at the top, specifically in our need positions.   Every player that I think is worth the 13th overall pick, regardless of our need: Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota, Leonard Williams, Kevin White, Amari Cooper, Vic Beasley, Dante Fowler, Shane Ray, Randy Gregory, Alvin Dupree, Brandon Scherff, La'el Collins, Trae Waynes, Danny Shelton. That's 14 guys total.  Out of those 14, I would be happy with the Saints drafting White, Williams, Cooper, Beasley, Fowler, Ray, Gregory, Dupree, Scherff, Waynes, and Shelton. Collins, too, if the others are taken. That's 12 out of those 14 that I fill a need for the Saints. It only excludes the QB's.   Either Winston or Mariota will go #1 overall, and there is zero doubt in my mind that the other will go in the top 10. That means at least 2 of those 12 players will be available when we pick at #13.  If we move up, it would most likely be from #31. Which wouldn't surprise me, because we've got a history of trading up from the late 1st. However, the only player I would trade up for (in the realistic scenarios I've seen in most mocks lately) would be Eric Kendricks, which I think would mean moving up 2 spots to jump the Packers. But there are guys I'd be happy to take instead in the 2nd. I don't think we need to trade up from #31, but don't be surprised if we do.  tl;dr: No reason to move up from #13; we might move up from #31, but we don't need to."
Saints,304q3w,cfiggis,2,Tue Mar 24 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"We traded up from 27 to 20 last season for a first and a third (No 91). We have 31 pick and the 75th and 78th.   It's definitely not out of the realm of possibilities that one of the 14 guys you listed fall into the 20s. Players fall every draft, and we have the buying power to get two of the 14 best players in the draft if that happens."
Saints,304q3w,brokenearth02,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:46:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly. there are too many great players available for all of them to be taken by the time we pick at #14, I agree with you 100%"
Saints,304q3w,Mudkipz137,2,Tue Mar 24 23:41:44 2015 UTC,"My only problem with moving up is that we lose picks. If we have 9 picks, we have 9 chances of striking gold, so to speak. If we trade up, sure, we get someone who's considered a better player, but if they don't pan out, that's an extra player we missed out on.  As we've seen, some of our picks lately haven't worked out, so let's maximize our chances with our extra picks.  Plus, it's not like we're one key piece from a championship team. We need good players at several positions. And backups/depth."
Saints,304q3w,serenity_suppository,2,Tue Mar 24 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"We need to stop swinging for the fences and focus on consistent base hits, to mix sports metaphors."

Saints,304q3w,Bouzal,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:01:32 2015 UTC,the difference in cap figure for first vs. second rounders is substantial enough that I'd rather trade one of them for either more later picks or a move up
Saints,304q3w,makeplayz,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:52:50 2015 UTC,"Me and my Eagles friend were talking this weekend and I brought up the TB game. But I like our positioning. There's gonna be a lot of talent at 13, and some great talent that may get passed up due to teams trading back/up for specific players. One trade alters the entire draft.  We have no need in moving up. We have too many picks to help bring in depth and younger competition, and depth is something we really lack. We signed lots of vets on defense. We lacked veteran leadership last year, obviously. Coupling that with the younger faster stronger athletic guys is always a positive.  I feel we should draft: - Edge Rusher - MLB - OG - DT - CB - QB - WR  leaving two other picks (im 99% sure we have 9), which we could use another OL and DL.  Do we take Amari Cooper if he falls (I don't think he does) to 13? If elite edge rushers are off the board, I'd really like Perryman or McKinney at 13, but most dont have Perryman in the first, most dont have him at 13 for sure. McKinney definitely would not be a bad pick at 13. He's gonna be a stud. But, I wouldn't be mad if we took Cooper at 13, we could still take defense at 31 and 44.  There's so much to consider and all these mock drafts are just trying to get page views in the dead part of the year when it comes to football content and viewership, it'll get worse come may-june.  But honestly, I dont see us moving up or down from 13 in the draft. We really have a chance to add cheap depth, and we cant afford to lose current and future picks to move up and get a guy like Mariota when we're about to rebuild after Brees retires/gets cut/traded. Our FO wants to get Drew another ring (sometimes it's hard to tell if we're really just trying to get in the record books). I don't see a move in anyway that lands us Mariota or Winston. We're cocking our guns for Drew to make another run."
Saints,304q3w,Bouzal,2,Tue Mar 24 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"I would say WR comes right after OG on your list. We now have a solid CB group with Browner and QB can be a 3rd or 5th round concern. If cooper fell to us we take him, but I wouldn't trade up"
Saints,304q3w,makeplayz,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:43:42 2015 UTC,Those weren't in any particular order tho. But I would prefer defense top 2.
Saints,304q3w,IceCreamJonsey,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"Ah okay. I agree with defense top two, it just depends who's there. If we could get Dupree or Beasley at 13 that would be awesome but who could we get at 31? If Anthony or Kendricks is there maybe them, but they might also be there at 44. Maxx Williams could be intriguing, or Jaylen Strong"
Saints,304q3w,mes8007,2,Tue Mar 24 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Preferably I'd rather trade back from 13 if whoever is on the board isn't worth taking and if we have our eye on a MLB. But like I said before there's so many factors, I'd be here all day typing up viable scenarios. My fingers are crossed for 2 defensive studs to replace the slow geriatrics we have at linebacker.  Also, I noticed something a few weeks ago. Aside from Ronald Powell, everyone on our defense that plays inside the box is 6'1"" or shorter. We have no height whatsoever. Thats why I want McKinney over Perryman.   Wishful thinking: We trade back from 13 to 20 or so and get McKinney, then draft Perryman at 31 and have 2 rookie MLBs to be the anchors in our 3-4 defense. I get boners thinking about it."
Saints,304q3w,bootscallahan,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:47:16 2015 UTC,It would really be nice to see them stock up this year.
Saints,304q3w,ULMmmMMMm,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:56:18 2015 UTC,I agree. If we were going to just give up a bunch of acquired picks to land one stud player. Might as well had kept the stud we had. But the entire point of moving players is to acquire picks to build team depth and not just have everything invested in 1 or 2 guys like the past few yrs.
Saints,303d94,KTDL,8,Tue Mar 24 03:20:27 2015 UTC,"Poppycock.  There were a lot of reasons to sign Spiller (e.g. punny fantasy names like 'Spiller Who Dat Ingram'), I doubt being a new playmaker was one of them."

Saints,303ej5,DiNovi,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Well if Beasley/ Dupree are at 13, we should take them. It'll only help our defense out if we improve our pass rush. Haralson is 31, don't know how many more years he will play. Sure there are other needs like ilb, nt, og, wr but I think that we need to draft early for a pass rusher so we don't get stuck grabbing another ""project"" player like powell.  So if we get one within the 3rd round i'll be happy."
Saints,303ej5,jackmuhswag,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah Gallete and Edabali/Haralson is fine to start the season with. Its not a bad depth position either we signed Jerry Franklin and we still have 2014 fifth rounder Ronald Powell.  Unless its a bonafided upgrade over what we have, we probably won't draft one at all.   IMO after Owa and maybe Orchard, all the other OLBs aren't worth our time."

Saints,302pps,ThatBoiiBryan,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:11:33 2015 UTC,Tomlinson would be horrible in our system and Marpet won't get out of the second round.

Saints,302pps,sophandros,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Different in position and the depth of talent at the position. As Talented as Armstead was, no one had him projected as a left tackle, so that excluded him out of the first round and first 5 or so tackles off the board. Marpet right now is considered one of the Top 5 interior lineman (except on lists that have Tackles that could be pushed inside) and in the top 3 of guard specific prospects."

Like that to a team that hasn't been doing hot lately (so, at a minimum, finished with a higher draft pick than us) plus the subsequent year's second.  And whoever their QB is currently.

Saints,301466,Saints2Death,8,Mon Mar 23 17:13:10 2015 UTC,This draft class could bolster our teams future talent allowing us to indulge in free agency the next couple of years. Hopefully we trade back once or twice in the draft to gain more picks next year as well. I like that we finally have more picks than usual. I think Payton and Loomis finally get it. With all these picks building the defense and finding drew's successor becomes way easier. the future is bright indeed. I also dont think Akiem Hicks will command a huge salary unless he has a huge year next year. Cam Jordan needs to step up this year back to his 2013 level to get a huge contract as well.

Saints,301bit,bootscallahan,7,Mon Mar 23 18:04:24 2015 UTC,We have to get some offensive line depth. We could not afford a single injury at any position on the line.
Saints,301bit,Saints2Death,7,Mon Mar 23 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Brees can make average receivers look good, but he can't make below-average linemen look good. It all starts there."
Saints,301bit,DarthWhoDat,2,Mon Mar 23 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately see all those ridiculous o-line rankings that had the saints top 5 last year. Brees throwing the ball away to avoid sacks and have a quick release made a bad line look good last year. To be fair, however, the receivers weren't doing the line any favors by taking so long to get open."
Saints,301bit,Jaul18,5,Tue Mar 24 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"I generally value your thoughts and analysis above those of most other redditors when it comes to Saints content.  I've been, personally, hoping we target Amari Cooper with our first pick if he is available since he would give us an athletic and fast deep threat with the caveat that he is a great route runner and has no off-the-field issues like Kenny did. Afterwards, we focus the rest of the draft on OL, DT, and LB depth.   Was wondering what your thoughts would be on this."
Saints,301bit,Saints2Death,6,Mon Mar 23 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"I think 13 is a great BPA (Best Player Available) spot. I don't think Cooper will be available, as a I think he's still the consensus No. 1 receiver despite what mock drafts are saying, but Parker might be available and White could fall. But I don't think White will make it out of the Top 10 either, and I'm not sure if Parker would be the best player available at 13 since Strong and Green-Beckham are just as good of prospects that would be available at 31.  I think the best value here might come at tackle. Not sure how much stock to put in mocks, but the vast majority I've seen has Collins and Peat available to us. This would give us a ton of options with Strief playing RT and either sticking the rookie at left tackle and pushing Armstead inside or pushing Collins inside and keeping Armstead at LT. Strief is getting up their in age and I'd like to see Armstead eventually move to the right side where he could be the best RT in the whole NFL and use the higher draft pick to get a more polished blocker for the left side. In this case, that would be Peat.   Bud Dupree will also be a good pick here as a BPA pick up as he's the 2nd best Sam linebacker in the draft outside of Fowler which will be a Top 5 pick. People on /r/saints talk about Ray and Beasley at 13, but both play the exact position as Galette and it would be pointless. None of Galette, Ray or Beasley would be worth a damn at the Sam position.   Shelton and Waynes might also be BPA picks here, but they'd have less of an impact in 2015, but provide incredible depth and have a chance to be future studs."
Saints,301bit,Jaul18,3,Mon Mar 23 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the response and agree with everything you've said, and also would be surprised if Cooper does actually fall to us. I've actually been pleased with our off-season (for the most part) since the FO seems to be trying to go back to what made us so successful in '09, which a lot of people don't seem to understand.  The only reason why I am so high on Cooper is because, as a current LSU student, watching him play on the field was so incredibly impressive. He's the second Alabama player that I've become a fan of (Ingram being the first), and I've always secretly wanted to see Drew with an elite WIDE receiver, no offense to Jimmy. That was one of the reasons that I was praying we somehow got OBJ last year, aside from him also being an LSU Tiger.  Edit: Not saying Cooper will be elite.. Just that he has the talent. I see him as an INITIALLY more refined but slightly smaller version of Demaryus Thomas."
Saints,301bit,Megawatts19,2,Mon Mar 23 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"That's the point I've been trying to make. I get that people want young flashy skill guys, but we have got to shore up the OL. I wouldn't mind seeing Kelemete inherit Grubbs spot. He looked promising in his limited time last year. You can take any scrub off the street and stick him at WR with Drew at the helm. Gotta get our trench play better."

Saints,2zxomb,Saints2Death,2,Sun Mar 22 21:09:06 2015 UTC,The average NFL career is 3 years.
Saints,2zz8fm,USNthrowawa,11,Mon Mar 23 04:07:15 2015 UTC,"heart said no, brain said yes.   it was very difficult but the thing I really don't like is who they traded him to.    Unger really needs to light the world on fire..."
Saints,2zz8fm,dieselpow3r3d,5,Mon Mar 23 12:07:39 2015 UTC,"Well you got Unger AND our #1 pick.  Unger is a great player when healthy and should be a solid addition.  Regarding Graham, wasn't he playing injured the majority of last year which explains his drop in production?   Wasn't he just an effective decoy at least half the weeks?  He gets called soft a lot and it may be true but he gutted it out last year and played injured which is pretty tough imo."
Saints,2zz8fm,s_stone634,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"He played the second half of 2014 with a separated shoulder and the entirety of 2013 with plantar fasciitis. He's not the toughest out there in terms of grit and physicality, but he's tough enough to play through those pretty painful injuries."
Saints,2zz8fm,psquared85,3,Tue Mar 24 04:13:47 2015 UTC,"Initially I was 100% ok with it.  Last season it felt like defenses were starting to key in on how to slow down his production. I know he was injured at times but even with his size he wasn't responding well to contact at times and overall he really didn't seem to have the same heart he had the year before his contract. Add to that his contract and the rumors that he was a part of the attitude problem and yeah...  So releasing that luggage for Unger and a 1st felt great but recently I've been re-watching some of last season and have remembered the impact he had on defenses. Turning other receivers free in favor of double covering Graham in key situations etc. And that's starting to niggle at me a little bit.  (Barring the draft) What is our passing game going to be like this season without Graham and Stills? What happens when we're behind and can't afford to grind it out with Ingram and Spiller?  TL;DR: Still ok with it, but will have nagging doubts until next season :)"
Saints,2zz8fm,sekularGuardian,3,Mon Mar 23 13:15:22 2015 UTC,"It seems luke, instead of having that extra pressure on defense devoted to double covering Graham, it'll be more towards the run game.  I hope Cooper will be avaliable at 13, maybe even if we trade up a few spots for him I'd be happy."
Saints,2zz8fm,Zakimus,3,Mon Mar 23 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"Graham was my favorite player for all of 2013 and I think he deserved to get paid.  Unfortunately it felt in 2014 that he was a bit too much about the money and he really didn't live up to what he got paid; too many dropped passes last season.  Overall it was best for both sides to get a fresh start, he gets to play with Wilson and we get the cap room we need, especially to shore up the defense that will put the pressure off of Brees.  Keep in mind Shockey brought us success and we have two talented TEs in the wings, Graham was always more of a WR and we all know it."
Saints,2zz8fm,pomeranc,0,Mon Mar 23 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"If we have a running game, we dont need a passing game."

Saints,2zz8fm,Arcturus_,3,Wed Mar 25 05:42:10 2015 UTC,"No one will know for sure how it will turn out until the season starts. On paper though, I think it's a win win for both teams. As much as I love jimmy, he was not a necessity to our offense. Moving forward with a new center was a necessity however, which we got. Getting another 1st as well just pushes it to the top."
Saints,2zz8fm,Lokipokie504,3,Mon Mar 23 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am actually happy about it more tape i watch on his ""blocking skills"" in the run game ."
Saints,2zz8fm,haledann,2,Mon Mar 23 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think it will be reminiscent of the Herschel Walker trade and will give us tremendous amounts of flexibility in this draft and future drafts. I dont think we use all 9 picks and we trade back once or twice to acquire more picks next year and in later rounds. I think Unger will take our run game to the next level, but I am worried about our receiving Corps. Aside from Colston and Cooks I dont trust any of our receivers to take over and win games for us like Jimmy and Kenny did for us. We'll take a receiver probably between the 1st and 3rd rounds. I just hope we get linebackers in the 1st two rounds, which is our biggest need IMO."

Saints,2zz8fm,Saints2Death,1 point,Mon Mar 23 16:57:31 2015 UTC,I think it's a great move. It shocked me because he would be on the short list (seemingly) of guys that would never be traded. But you take that luxury and get a great Center (position of sore need for us) and you get a first round pick out of it?! Absolutely a great trade for us.
Saints,2zz8fm,Megawatts19,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like it. Jimmy's salary wasn't that bad, he can dictate match-ups and is as big of a red-zone monster as there is in the league.  I also don't like getting a center in the trade. Centers aren't generally taken in the first two rounds of the draft so I don't like the value there, especially coming with some injury history. Also our history with late 1st round draft picks just hasn't been that good so to me the risk of drafting a bust + a center who could probably have been drafted in round 2 or 3 isn't worth Jimmy imo."

When one of the 3 sucks, the entire defense tends to suck. I think that our most underrated offseason move is our bringing in Dennis Allen as defensive assistant.

Saints,2zvf4t,batmanisfiya,3,Sun Mar 22 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, I wanna see Browner and Vaccaro play like they're capable of and just lay people out across the middle  Obviously first and foremost is make sure our defense plays well, but having even just a couple real big hits early in games can take the pressure of the secondary. Receivers will start hearing footsteps and all, maybe make a few bad drops, plus it's fun to watch  Another reason why I wanna see us get Parryman, the kid is viscous (in a controlled way) and having that aggression on defense is one of the best things a defense can have, motivates the whole team"

Saints,2zvepc,whodat951,2,Sun Mar 22 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"Love me some Paul Dawson, and I'm a fan of Anthony too. But, as you hit on, they're both most likely gone by the middle of the second round. I like a guy like Bryce Hagar with one of our 5ths (or possibly 78 if they feel he won't make it to the 5th) if we fail to take an ILB with our first 3 picks.  Also really like Xavier Cooper, but he's a little undersized to play 34NT."
Saints,2zvepc,Brees2Graham,2,Sun Mar 22 06:32:33 2015 UTC,"Good write up for all these players, but I don't think New Orleans is looking a lot of these players, particularity the thumper linebackers.  After you get past Owamagbe Odighizuwa and maybe Eli Harold the OLBs no longer become an upgrade over Haralson/Edabali, plus we spent a fifth rounder on Ronald Powell last year and we signed Jerry Franklin. We don't need the depth we need a bonafied upgrade at the position.  Kwon Alexander and Bryce Hager are probably the only late round ILBs who can be effective in pass coverage in the NFL level. I wouldn't assume they are three down guys though."
Saints,2zvepc,flordeliest,2,Sun Mar 22 04:27:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I do think that a lot of these guys could prove much better than Powell and Franklin and having as many options as possible at one of our weakest positions certainly couldn't hurt. If we get past two rounds without drafting one of the better LBs we're in trouble."
Saints,2zvepc,flordeliest,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:14:22 2015 UTC,Whodat who would rather us take at 13 if available Shelton or Gregory?
Saints,2zvepc,flordeliest,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"Shelton after much thought. Gregory seems to come with higher risk, and Shelton would immediately shore up our run defense. I'm from the West Cost so I see Pac-12 games a lot more than Big 10 so I may be biased though. If we stay at 13 and have to pick between these guys, I'm gonna be stoked either way."
Saints,2zv48p,lumpy_,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:41:48 2015 UTC,I think Beasley is the first or second guy not a QB drafted. There is zero chance he makes it past Washington. Fowler or Ray doesn't seem worth it and one might be available at 13 anyway.  There isn't much more value in trading up than staying at 13. At 13 we are getting an edge rusher + another player  with the pick we didn't use if we traded up.
Saints,2zv48p,flordeliest,1 point,Sun Mar 22 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"Well while the price seemed high, Kendricks is going to be very coveted by teams in the 25-32 range. Especially GB. IMO, Kendricks is by far the most complete LB, and the only one worthy of a first round selection.   Anyway, the reason why the price was sort of steep is because of how coveted he is in that range and people know who we're trying to get by trying to jump the likes of INDY, GB, etc. Other teams/drafters know we wanted Kendricks and to get him we got to jump up a few spots. So technically, they hold all the cards. If we want our player we gotta pay the price.   Given we had 2 thirds* I think we could afford to make the move, even if the trade ""value"" wasn't necessarily in our favor.  Now I understand we could get Anthony there, or Dawson at 44(which I'd like a lot). But we all like Kendricks a lot and you gotta do what you gotta do."
Saints,2zv48p,Brees2Graham,3,Sun Mar 22 06:52:51 2015 UTC,"If I was a Saints fan, I'd be very happy with these draft choices. Top to bottom good players IMO."
Saints,2zv48p,Indfanfromcol,2,Sun Mar 22 06:25:41 2015 UTC,"We paid a lot to only move up 5 spots from the bottom of the first for Kendeicks. I mean Thompson, Anthony or Kendricks would have been available at 31. Any of the three would fill our dire need for linebacker who is't a liability.  I feel like a NT like Philips would be preferable to a corner at 44. Jenkins and Bunkley aren't getting the job done. I have some optimism for our corners.   Overall though pretty good mock, although it seems some of the other GMs didn't take it seriously."
Saints,2zv48p,flordeliest,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, whenever we do these mocks there are always some people who take the piss. Of course most are sensible but many people do random shit so they can have more picks or GM a team they have no idea about.  We moved up because we agreed the difference between Kendricks & any other ILB was worth it. Kendricks is my favourite player in the entire draft and I am of the belief he will be star whilst the other ILBs will be merely average so we discussed the idea then decided the move would have been worth it.  Also of note, there is 0 chance any 3-4 team takes Shaq to play an every down ILB."
Saints,2zv48p,ashsky,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:41:41 2015 UTC,"The size concerns apply to him projecting as a 4-3 Will, basically a run-stopping/blitzing OLB not as a 3-4 Will. He played in a 3-4 at Washington.  If Shaq can't be an every down ILBs than Kendricks, who weighted four more pounds than him at the combine,  probably can't either. People only say that because of a quote on his NFL profiles. The quote once again is about in a 4-3 system.  Shaq is better in coverage then Kendricks, he aligns more with our needs than any other ILBs."
Saints,2zv48p,flordeliest,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"I wrote out a really nice long reply to this because accidentally hit return and lost it so this will definitely not be as well thought/wrote out.  However, Shaq played at around 220 during the season and bulked up (potentially) his max. He has a small build and so it would be extremely hard to put on more weight where as Kendricks only improved by 2 lbs for the combine and has a larger frame which would allow a further grow of muscle mass which would allow him to be an every down ILB. Biology as a science is almost a certainty in such cases.  Then if we're using combine, Kendricks posted better in everything they did comparatively before his hamstring started niggling him. Shaq was meant to be the athletic one.  I also disagree about the coverage, Kendricks is better in my opinion. I have watched 2 of Shaq's games and 5 of Kendricks' because I was interested during some free time. Ontop of Kendricks being better than Shaq in pass if at minimum, only slightly, he is much better in run support. Seeing as we had something like the 29th worst run defensive last year, any additional help is optimal. Kendricks also has played 3-4 too? UCLA use a multiple package scheme utilizing many different looks. 3-4 was the most common one during his Sophomore season potentially his best season along with his Senior.  Long write up but I am really not high on Shaq and would not take him first round as there is just too much potential in many other position. Then specifically comparing at ILB, Kendricks is MUCH better in my opinion with the gap not being close at all which is why we moved up in this mock here as we agreed he was by far a better player than the rest of the potential ILBs available in the draft.  Shaq may be worth it in the 2nd but I really am not a fan and I feel that there's a possibility he may bust which would be unfortunate however I do not feel a 1st is worth risking it over.  Edit: A lot longer than I expected this to be but I have some very strong opinions on Shaq as is quite evident. I really am not a fan and would most probably take Anthony, Perryman and McKinney over him too. Of course, everyone shares a different opinion which I can 100% respect but I do like sharing my views :D"
Saints,2zv48p,ashsky,1 point,Sun Mar 22 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"I like our first round, although I hope someone other than Dupree falls to us (Don't like how raw he is). I think that while Kevin Johnson would be good for us, we could have traded back in the second if possible based on who else was there. I hadn't done a lot of research on Kouandijo before seeing us pick him in this mock, but after looking at his draft profile, I think this was the worst pick we made by far.   EDIT: John Miller looks like a much better option at guard, in my opinion."
Saints,2zv48p,whodat951,1 point,Sun Mar 22 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"The thing about Kouandijo is that he was the BPA at the time, he and miller were the only guards left"

Saints,2zv48p,Saints2Death,2,Sun Mar 22 04:40:23 2015 UTC,Because Dupree can play a stand up linebacker where Ray has only played a 4-3 DE and we're already paying Galette a ton of money to play that when we play 4 man fronts.

It's pretty funny since I don't give two shits about karma until it's -5 and the most they get me down is -1.  But on to the real discussion, I think Flowers is one of the best tackle prospects to come out in a few years and is the best tackle available in this draft. The fact that he'd be available with the 26th pick is absolutely ridiculous. I think putting Flowers at LT, Armstead at LG and Strief at RT with Armstead primed to take over at RT would be too good to pass up. Regarless, Flowers will never make it out of the Top 20 and honestly don't see him not being a Top 15 pick."

Even though he was injured and hadn't played with the Saints their 2009 season (and looked to be retired), I still wore his jersey for every game. Imagine my surprise when he jumps back on the team (after several injuries decimated our DBs) just days before playing the Patriots on MNF. Then he intercepts Tom Brady on a crucial drive.    Life. Made. :-D     In one of the interviews after the game, he said ""this is my Superbowl"" and that just choked me up! I loved that even though he didn't get to play in the actual Superbowl that season, he still got a ring. So proud of him..."

Defenses always had to account for him and change up their scheme when he was on the field. PT because he gave it 100% ask the time, even when Brees had given up in games PT would still be there running people over for those few extra yards. Lance because of that one TD pay, you know the one."
Saints,2zplsk,Andy_Gator,3,Fri Mar 20 16:59:44 2015 UTC,Definitely Colston! He's gracious and humble but also a hard worker! I can't stand when guys act a fool after making a catch or a stop. It's your job for crying out loud! Marques is an example to athletes everywhere.

Saints,2zplsk,Geauxtigersgeaux,3,Fri Mar 20 19:26:19 2015 UTC,Ingram. My favorite thing about him is he can bust a 50 yard run and get up angry because he didn't score. He's a hell of a competitor and is really making a name for himself in this league

But what puts it over the top is my roommate is a seahawks fan so it's just in my face all the time.  He told me he was buying a Graham seahawks jersey and taking down my Saints one and I near punched him in the face.

Saints,2zoy6f,makeplayz,2,Fri Mar 20 19:05:03 2015 UTC,I really don't like the hype around Shaq Thompson
Saints,2zoy6f,ashsky,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:13:16 2015 UTC,"Shaq really would not be a good pick for us in my opinion. Far too undersized to play LB in a 3-4, might fit a 4-3 Olb but most probably a safety which we definitely do not need."
Saints,2zoy6f,makeplayz,2,Fri Mar 20 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly why I don't like the hype. He could be great, but on another team."
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,0,Fri Mar 20 19:18:51 2015 UTC,Shaq is the best coverage ILB next to Kendricks.
Saints,2zoy6f,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:39:24 2015 UTC,"He also weighs 220, no way any DCs play him as an OLB. He'll be a S in the box some, but still he's gonna be a S."
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,0,Fri Mar 20 19:41:08 2015 UTC,"no way any DCs play him as an OLB   He is an ILB, New Orleans would play him as an ILB.  He weighed at 228 at the combine, I don't know where you are getting that number from. There has been ILBs lighter in the NFL. That is a lazy assessment. Shaq is great at reading QBs and makes tons of plays on the ball. He is the most instinctive coverage linebacker in the draft."
Saints,2zoy6f,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:56:23 2015 UTC,"Youre really knit-picking over 8 pounds?  We need a outside pass rusher so bad. We need an interior rush more than anything. Shaq Thompson's coverage skills may be great for a young guy coming out of the draft, but getting an undersized ""LB"" that can cover is like in the middle of our overall concerns.  OL and DL obviously is our No 1 concern, followed by LBs that can tackle (lol) and DBs. Perryman, McKinney, Dupree, Beasley, and Fowler are safer picks. Thompson is a luxury pick. Would I be mad if we picked him in the 2nd or 3rd, where he's likely to go? No. Would I be mad if we picked him in the first? I'd be livid. Although, not as livid as I was about the Brandin Cooks pick.  IF we draft Thompson, I'd be ok with taking him after taking a LB at 13 and 31. Thompson at 44, I can get by with. But there's a lot of Safety-needy teams. He could be taken last 1st, early 2nd. I wouldn't be mad if we drafted him (hypothetically speaking) if we trade Vacarro, either."
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,0,Fri Mar 20 20:02:11 2015 UTC,"Perryman and McKinney can't do anything that Hawthorne and Ellerbe cant already do.   Our pass defense was bad because our linebackers can't cover and we had only one competent corner, not to mention all our safeties got hurt. Our pass rush rarely had an opportunity to pass rush because we were usually behind and teams would just run the ball. When teams did pass they QBs got the ball out extremely quickly because of blown overages by the linebackers and corners. Extra pass rush is fine and always helpful but we have the exact same D-line as in 2013 that ranked 4th in sacks that now in 2014 they ranks 25th. Pass rush isn't actually the solution to the problem.  We don't need an edge rusher to attack the QBs we are usually projected to take one based on BPA not need. We just paid Gallete, Edebali looked really promising and Haralson is returning. As far as the D-line goes we could use we could use a NT tackle to help against the run but that's all we need on the D-line."
Saints,2zoy6f,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:36:34 2015 UTC,I agree with the DT part.
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,0,Fri Mar 20 20:42:39 2015 UTC,3-4 defense requires NTs.
Saints,2zoy6f,BootsBean,0,Fri Mar 20 21:59:35 2015 UTC,"Multiple sources have him playing at 219 or below.  He came into the combine about 2"" shorter and 10+lbs lighter than people were expecting.  Some scouts are saying his physical profile fits better with Safety than LB, and I agree.  Imagine someone with Brees' size but 10 more pounds playing linebacker.  I hope we steer clear of him.    Here's his combine info page. http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/shaq-thompson?id=2552447"
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"They are talking about as a 4-3 Will OLB, New Orleans runs a 3-4 defense. 3-4 Will ILB are typically smaller and almost always used in coverage and they aren't eating up blocks or attacking the line of scrimmage like their 4-3 counterpart, so yes size is absolutely less of a factor or detriment. Even then there are 4-3 Wills that size, most notably Lavante David."

All the other AFC north teams run a 3-4."
Saints,2zoy6f,ashsky,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"Kendricks is definitely my favourite of the bunch however in my opinion, Perryman and McKinny would definitely be fine too although not as good as Kendricks. However, I feel that Kendricks will be picked up before us with several teams needing ILBs e.g Packers & 49ers as he has superior pass coverage. Not keen on Shaq though.  I'm looking forward to seeing what we do."
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'm prioritizing coverage ability in an ILB because that is the whole reason we need one, the ones we have can't cover. So IMO Perryman and most slow ILBs are out of discussion."
Saints,2zoy6f,LucasJLeCompte,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"As a Junior and Senior Dupree finished in the Top 10 of the SEC in Tackles For Loss, Force Fumbles and Sacks. He wraps up defenders and uses proper technique.  Most important part is that the man can tackle, something the entire defense counted do last season."
Saints,2zoy6f,asmodeus01,5,Fri Mar 20 18:14:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Dupree at 13 if he's there.  He still needs some work on his technique when engaging linemen, but he's disciplined, smart, and freakishly athletic for 6'4"", 270."
Saints,2zoy6f,ashsky,3,Fri Mar 20 13:52:28 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree with you. He is definitely raw and can improve but all of the natural talent is there and would be the perfect fit for us especially. Even though some disagree, I definitely think he is worth it at 13 if someone like Dante Fowler doesn't drop."
Saints,2zoy6f,Charizard_Targaryen,3,Fri Mar 20 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"Two words I keep hearing about Dupree are ""raw"" and ""potential."" Whenever you're talking about picking a guy with that description at 13, there is a very high risk of bust. I like to save the raw guys with potential for 3rd round or later. Not saying he can't step in and be great, because nobody knows. However, I don't think I'd feel comfortable with him at 13 with so many other good players on the board."
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:34:12 2015 UTC,"He is only raw in using rushing techniques because they don't exist. He still got  ton of sacks with just athleticism. He can cover and work in space extremely well for his size. He would be a damn good Sam OLB day one, we don't really need a Jack with Gallete and Edabali."
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,0,Fri Mar 20 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"He has power moves when he's rushing inside. He just doesn't use any finesse moves that you'd expect out of someone with his speed to do. When analysts saying he got sacks with just athleticism, they are being lazy."
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,2,Fri Mar 20 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. Watching the first .gif I put up, it's easy to see the guy has some power. I like him as a solid SOLB pick up at 13"
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,0,Fri Mar 20 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hate when people say, ""he just out athletics guys."" Then find me a better textbook example of a rip move inside than the first .gif. His major problem is he doesn't have a swim move mainly because he has relatively short arms and attempting to swim most tackles would lead to him getting swallowed fairly easy.   He still has a great rip move inside and has elite speed and strength to be effective outside. The other techniques can be taught, but he's definitely not as raw as people make him out to be."
Saints,2zoy6f,KTDL,2,Fri Mar 20 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"I like him because he can do everything, he just doesn't necessarily do everything great, but the versatility can be built upon. He can play both sides of the OLB, can drop down in four man fronts, did a ton of underneath zone coverage at Kentucky (and while not great at it,was decent) and can get after the QB.  With Fowler off the board (unless there is a miracle from God), I think Dupree is the best option for the Saints at replacing an aging Haralson"
Saints,2zoy6f,typical0,-1,Fri Mar 20 21:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, anyone who mocks Fowler outside of the Top 5 should not be allowed to mock anymore."

Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,0,Sat Mar 21 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"6'4"" 270 pound pass rushers who run in the 4.5s aren't available in the third round or later."
Saints,2zoy6f,Charizard_Targaryen,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"Generally they aren't. That's the risk, and I would be unwilling to take it. There's no such thing as a ""sure thing"" in the draft, but there are much safer players at 13."
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,0,Fri Mar 20 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Come on man, it's not like Dupree was horrible in college. He put up decent stats in college despite playing on one of the worst defenses in the SEC. He was about the only person on Kentucky that teams game planned against, and he would have been much better on film if teams didn't consistently run away from him.   He has talent and he has good film. He's more polished than Jadeveon Clowney, since the only move Clowney had was running around defenders."
Saints,2zoy6f,aimerj,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the guy and I won't throw my remote across the room if we draft him. I just think that there are definitely 13 players I'd draft ahead of him. His highlight reel is awesome, but while watching his game film I felt that he took too many plays off.  Reminds me a little of Barkevious Mingo who turned out to be average at best in the NFL."
Saints,2zoy6f,aimerj,0,Fri Mar 20 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"Again, Mingo's only move was running around blockers. Dupree actually has a skill set outside of speed."
Saints,2zoy6f,aimerj,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Only fits at 13 are Shelton or Waynes. Unless, an actual good pass rusher somehow falls, Beasley, Ray, or Williams"
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,2,Sat Mar 21 04:56:34 2015 UTC,"Why get a pure pass rusher like Beasley, you already have Galette. You can't put Beasley on the strong side (or galette if his prior history of run stopping/pass coverage is any indication). Dupree is a complete SOLB. That is a perfect fit at 13."
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Mar 21 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"In regards  to Elite Rusher if they fall,  we can have them as situational, or set it up like Ware and Miller in Denver, also we probably aren't drafting development with first pick,  which that guy is. Plus he will be a bust as a top 15 guy IMO, so I'm hoping someone else either takes him earlier, or our organization feels the same as I do. We are in desperate need of CB depth, because even if our tandem does do well, anyone can get injured, just like Lewis did last year, and developing the long lengthy CBs Waynes and SPB will fill slot corner needs as well as the future. And above all I think the two most valuable players to us are Leonard Williams and Danny Shelton, because NT affects so many other things, and having elite NT is the difference between Baltimore D and Cleveland D"
Saints,2zoy6f,flordeliest,0,Sat Mar 21 19:09:07 2015 UTC,"Dupree isn't a developmental pick. He can start from day 1, but, like most rookie LBs, there is a learning curve.  We have a lot of CB depth currently (though I would consider it high end talent).   I wanna stay as far away from Leonard Williams as possible, but Danny is a good player. Dupree is the 2nd best SOLB in this draft. I'd love to have him. Don't see anything that would cause me to think bust.   We don't need situational guys, we need starters."
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Mar 21 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"I don't understand where you think there's depth at CB? We have two starters and SJB who hasn't shown anything?  And why in the world would you stay away from Williams,  that guy has shown nothing but Pro Bowl talent. I said either situational or play it like ware and miller in Denver,  Rob Ryan is one of the best to figure that out."

From what he coaches have said well prob see sjb getting a lot of snaps. The team usually gives players a couple of years before giving up.  As for Williams, he takes a lot of plays off. Questions about his work ethic. No thanks"
Saints,2zoy6f,Saints2Death,0,Sun Mar 22 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"Dupree fits best in New Orleans because we need a Sam OLB not a Jack OLB(ours is Gallette), unlike all the other teams who are looking for 4-3 DE and 3-4 Jacks. Dupree's pass rush techniques aren't were they need to be if he is going to rush almost every down as a Jack or DE, but as a Sam he is more likely to be used in coverage where he excels more than all the other edge rushers."

This is what I recall to the best of my memory, but anyone's free to correct me if I have my facts wrong.  Basically, retired numbers aren't set in stone by the NFL and the rules regarding them are up to each team's discretion. Most teams do, but teams like Dallas and Oakland don't retire numbers. Some teams allow retired numbers to be reissued under special circumstances, like when Steve Largent gave Jerry Rice permission to wear #80 in Seattle.   The Saints' rule is that they do indeed retire numbers, but they let the equipment manager decide whether or not to issue those numbers to current players. #31 and #81 belong to hall of famers Jim Taylor and Doug Atkins, respectively. They both played for the Saints, but each only spent a very short time on the team at the end of their careers before retiring. Both are legendary players, but neither are a substantial part of this franchise's history, which is why you'll see players on the team today wearing #31 and #81. However, #8 and #26 BELONG to Archie and Deuce."

Saints,2zomjf,evtine,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:37:36 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see Trae Waynes as the best cb in the draft. So for me, it isn't a stretch. I'd be highly upset if we left Beasely on the board and took Waynes."
Saints,2zomjf,VegasSaint9,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:43:57 2015 UTC,Beasley all the way that guys a freak athlete. He could make our pass rush pretty scary and put it over the top. That would make every DB on our roster look way better.
Saints,2zomjf,sfzen,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:59:08 2015 UTC,"Who would take Waynes in the top 10? He would be a reach, and none of the teams picking 1-10 have a big enough need at CB that would warrant passing up on the elite talent elsewhere. I could see him going to Minnesota at 11, but I doubt it. I think he goes 14-20."
Saints,2zomjf,backgrinder,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:31:08 2015 UTC,"Corners are at such a premium I feel someone will stretch on him, especially after his combine. He doesn't jump off tape but his measurables are off the chart. This is the same draft where Jalen Collins, who never looked anything but average at LSU, is also expected to go in the first mind you. After QB's and pass rushers corner is the position most likely to get reached on imo, that's the Seattle effect (well, really the Lombardi effect if you are a student of the games history)."
Saints,2zomjf,sfzen,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"I've got a feeling that a lot of the people rating Jalen Collins so highly are more focused on measureables than tape. The fact that he's coming from DB U doesn't hurt his case, either."

Saints,2zkqei,flordeliest,6,Thu Mar 19 11:50:40 2015 UTC,I like Griffin from what little you see of him every preseason but now that we have so many picks I'm crossing my fingers that they take a chance and pick up Bryce Petty. It would give him a good amount of time to sit behind Brees and he would fit into our scheme well.

Saints,2zkqei,thatEhden,2,Thu Mar 19 20:53:00 2015 UTC,I honestly wouldn't mind dropping Griffin and drafting a QB in the 2nd or 3rd round. The team has needs but it also has a lot of picks and by time Brees retires Griffin's contract would be up.

Saints,2zkqei,Lokipokie504,3,Thu Mar 19 13:02:58 2015 UTC,I also like petty a lot. He would be great with a couple of years behind drew
Saints,2zkqei,Saints2Death,-2,Thu Mar 19 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"why would he need a couple years behind Brees? There's zero proof that sitting a QB for several years has any impact on their career. In fact with the CBA, you're just wasting precious rookie contract years."
Saints,2zkqei,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:33:39 2015 UTC,"He's not NFL ready right now. He needs to fix some things like decision making and reading a defense. The only person that I can recall that sat for a bit was Aaron Rodgers, and that worked out quite well. What I CAN tell you is that throwing QB's into the fire that aren't quite ready yet is proven to ruin them."
Saints,2zkqei,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Mar 19 18:29:43 2015 UTC,Aaron Rodger was a first round pick and the 2nd rated QB in the draft. There is zero evidence that if he played as a rookie that he wouldn't have progressed just as well as he did sitting for three seasons.
Saints,2zkqei,Lokipokie504,2,Thu Mar 19 18:49:24 2015 UTC,"Seeing as he completely overhauled his mechanics while he was sitting, there's at least anecdotal evidence. There's also 0 evidence that he would've been just as good without sitting. There's no evidence either way, so just use Occam's Razor dude. Don't be argumentative just for the sake of it."
Saints,2zkqei,Saints2Death,-2,Thu Mar 19 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"Both Mannings, Big Ben, Wilson, Luck, Flacco, Cutler, Ryan, Stafford, Newton, Tannehill, and Dalton didn't need to sit for years, or even a full year. I really doubt if Rodgers played as a rookie that he'd be worse than he is now."
Saints,2zkqei,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know either. He could, or he couldn't. All we know is, he sat while they had a HOF qb, changed his mechanics and learned the playbook and practiced with a legend, took over when the time was right, and is now the best qb in the game. Anything else is speculation. And who's to say that guys like Andy Dalton, Cutler, and Cam wouldn't have benefitted from sitting some to start their careers. All 3 have not progressed much since coming into the league (Cam has the most progression, but still not much). Luck and both the Mannings were some of the best prospects of all time (Aaron Rodgers was not), Big Ben only started because of injuries, and Wilson simply out played Matt Flynn to win the starting job. If Bryce Petty comes in and outplays Drew Brees, by all means, hand the reigns over. He's a HOFer already."
Saints,2zkqei,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Mar 19 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"Ok think about it this way, if developing QBs behind future hall of fame QBs worked, NFL history would be littered with former backups. It's not some revolutionary concept. Why did Miami do this when Marino retired? Or Denver with Elway? Bills with Kelly? Cowboys with Aikman?   In the past 30 years, a team with a future hall of famer has transitioned seamlessly to another great QB 3 times:   The first time it was with a former first round bust who was 30 years old when he became the full-time starter.   The second time it ruined the future hall of famer's legacy with the franchise to the point where the team has been worried about honoring him in case the fans boo.   The third it took a season ending neck injury where the team got the No. 1 overall pick in a year that a generational prospect graduated.   And what about Brees, Brady and Manning's backups? Why have none of them went on to have even average careers?"
Saints,2zkqei,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Mar 19 19:52:18 2015 UTC,I can also tell you that most of the good QBs playing right now did not need to wait a full season to play.

Saints,2zji83,sfzen,19,Thu Mar 19 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"He would play like Jordan Jefferson, run backwards, dance, then get tackled. He didn't have the ability to win consistently. He would make terrible decisions during the game. He just wasn't a good qb. Here's a brooks joke. The Saints find this talented walk on WR. He's got the size & skills, but he's not too bright. Despite his mental disabilities, Aaron Brooks loves this guy, because cornerbacks can't stop him & he catches everything (even Brooks' passes). Coach Haslett, though he loves the guys skills, doesn't know if the guy is smart enough to learn his routes. So he tells the prodigical WR in front of the team in the locker room, ""If you can answer this one question, you can start next season."" The question is what's 2+2? The guy spits & sputters & after several minutes the guy comes up with the answer 4. Meanwhile, Brooks is sitting in disgust in the corner. Haslett soon walks up to Aaron & asks what's wrong? Brooks then replies ""Coach, you know that was a tough one. Why don't you give him another chance?"""

Saints,2zji83,Johnny-Rico,5,Thu Mar 19 14:55:40 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of misinformation about Brooks. You really had to be there. Your typical /r/NFL moron can't wait to bleat about a ""backwards"" pass, but if you see the film there's about fourteen Chargers players ready to cave his head in. He was trying to extend the play. He gets shit on for smiling after interceptions, he gets shit on for doing everything he can to extend a drive.  Now that we've been dropping 40 points on the rest of the league for 9 years, it's easy to forget what it was like when Brooks took over in 2000. Ricky Williams was finally playing well but fractured his foot against a typically irrelevant Panthers team. The next week Jeff Blake gets hurt against the Raiders. Two of the team's three best players are gone and in comes a rookie QB.  His first game as a starter, he beats the Greatest Show on Turf. Max respect to the Rams. They were incredible. Brooks beats them in St. Louis. He is as cool as a cucumber and the Saints go on to win the division. As a reward, the Saints get to play in the first round.... the Rams. :)  They only made it to two Super Bowls, but the reputation of those Rams has faded over time, I think. They were dominant. They could embarrass any team at any time. Warner was an assassin, Martz was the bad guy in an 80s action film and nobody could dislike Vermeil. All that, and Joe Horn gets hurt for the playoff game. The Saints win and there isn't a fan alive that doesn't think that Brooks is one of the greatest dudes in the universe after that first playoff victory.  Brooks and Haslett never went back to the playoffs. I want to say they were the 7th best team in the NFC a couple of times, which is infuriating to experience. I'm not going to say Haslett was a great coach, but he wasn't drafting the players. It wasn't his fault he got 14 road games his final year or whatever it was. (It's hilarious that Pro Football Reference lists the Giants game as a home game for the Saints here.) It wasn't Brooks's fault that the second-best target he ever had was Willie Jackson. He was fine. There were organizational problems and sure, he could have taken his job a little more seriously. Think of the third best quarterback for any other team in the division and tell me Brooks doesn't stack up."
Saints,2zji83,war3zwolf,1 point,Thu Mar 19 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"He wasnta rookie, he sat behind Brett Favre for a yr. I remember TV analyst used to say that's where he got some of that loving to gamble mindset from. But unlike Brett, his gambling didn't pay off most of the time. And also, overall Brooks wasn't that good dude. One playoff appearance in 6 yrs with saints. And Jeff Blake started 11 of those game in the only season we made playoffs. Brooks came in and went 3-2 to help us win the division title. Not exactly a season changing performance. He mostly just came in and and didn't ruin the momentum we already had going. Had Brooks started the entire yr, we probably wouldn't have made playoffs like all the other seasons he started in. also brooks had a short NFL career.. 8 yrs. Only starter from week one in 5 of them.. So yes he's below average. Lol"

Barely any line. No defense.   And for people that say stuff about ""smiling when he threw interceptions,"" when you have a bad day at work or some mouthy person talks shit and you cant say anything because you'll lose your job, dont you smile out of frustration? That's a reaction a lot of people give in situations of frustration, they laugh it off.   For people who say he didn't care or didn't have any passion, rewatch the lateral miracle against Jacksonville. Tell me who threw the block at the 10 yard like to give Jerome Pathon a walk in entrance to the end zone. I'll save you the trouble, it was AB. But, he doesn't/didn't care."

Saints,2zji83,Saints2Death,6,Thu Mar 19 03:39:16 2015 UTC,seeing both their faults is implied by what i said
Saints,2zji83,tygerbrees,2,Thu Mar 19 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"He was a decent QB, he certainly had the physical skills but jesus was his decision making wrong at the wrong time. A fine QB untill your life is on the line then its game over."
Saints,2zji83,billdasmacks,2,Thu Mar 19 06:11:06 2015 UTC,Glad I'm not the only one who was bothered by him smiling and laughing after throwing INTs... That always made my skin crawl for some reason.
Saints,2zji83,CaptainZeep,5,Thu Mar 19 03:31:10 2015 UTC,Classic scapegoat. Some people are too stupid to realize that he was actually half way decent.
Saints,2zji83,Andy_Gator,4,Thu Mar 19 02:59:12 2015 UTC,Almost average is more like it.
Saints,2zji83,Saints2Death,0,Thu Mar 19 03:39:42 2015 UTC,Sort of satisfactory?
Saints,2zji83,ShrimpBoots,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:46:38 2015 UTC,He was exactly as you say.  About halfway decent.   And that's being generous.
Saints,2zji83,bobbyblack,2,Thu Mar 19 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"Brooks' Saints career started going downhill after McCarthy left.   Anyway, some fans like to point to the backwards pass. The guy was trying to make a play.   Some fans point to laughing after a pick. I've seen guys like Favre, Manning (both), and others do the same thing. I've also seen other quarterbacks (Cam, Cutler...) receive criticism for their unhappiness after a bad play. You can't have it both ways. But what irks me more is this seemingly recent trend of fans getting upset with players because of body language and/or demeanor. It doesn't fucking matter. Quit making sports more like TMZ or Entertainment Tonight by focusing on bullshit like that. Focus on a guy's actual performance, not whether or not he showed the appropriate amount of the sort of emotion you want to see in the situation."
Saints,2zji83,sophandros,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"People associate him with all of the 8-8 Haslett years. He honestly wasn't that bad, but the team around him was mediocre, and when he was bad he was absolutely awful. So instead of remembering his good games we tend to associate him with the bad stuff, since that 2001-2005 era of Saints football was just one disappointment after another."
Saints,2zji83,PhoSho86,1 point,Thu Mar 19 07:25:08 2015 UTC,I think it was more of his attitude than his talent that made him garbage. He seemed to have a non caring attitude (throwing INTs and go to the sideline and laugh/smile). One of my best friends was a chef at the dome during Brook's time and said that he was an Ahole in person.

Saints,2zl5vv,aimerj,2,Thu Mar 19 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"Like:   Agholor - Good value, and we need some talent in the passing game after the recent trades. Humphries - Absolute steal in the 6th, don't expect that will happen on draft day. Perryman - ILB and Guard are critical needs for us. His combine measurables are worrying, but I like what I see on tape.   In the Middle:   Shelton - A good pure NT, but we aren't short of decent/average players there, he'd need to shine to justify taking him first.  No denying though that our interior pass rush sucked last year. Harold - Quality Pass Rusher, coverage is not so hot, a good pick for depth, but I'd prefer to wait until rounds 2-3. Dismukes - Hard to tell how this guy will fare in the NFL, but we need O-Line depth.  Might even be a Don't Like given he was taken in the third.   Don't Like:   James - I just don't think it's worth using a draft pick to try and replace Jimmy, Jimmy can't be replaced.  The solution is to redesign our strategy.  With that in mind, I think our current Tight Ends are good enough to hold their own and we can look to a UDFA if we want to add another. Diggs - This guy is a tragedy, there's so much to like about him but I just can't get over the fact this guy is 5'9. F-I-V-E-N-I-N-E.  I hope it works out for him somehow.  Try UDFA. Bridge - I actually like this guy alot, but if you've noticed a pattern, I think he can be had without spending a draft pick.   Comments:  We did not draft a guard, unless the plan is to slide Humphries inside.  We have a desperate need at guard and can't neglect that position on draft day.  We did draft two linebackers, which is another critical need.  I would even consider drafting 2 ILB's.  Even though I'm not confident in Shelton, if he performs in the middle it will make life much easier for our edge rushers, would could quickly put the defense back in 2013 form, so I like the upside there.  We did get a good value at receiver, and even though I don't like it, took a tight end.  Theres always some risk of disappointment there, though, since receivers usually need a year or two to adjust to the pros.  If I'm wrong about Bridge not being drafted, I'd give you credit for nabbing him before someone else did."

If you did the former and then switched TE James to WR/CB Tony Lippett, I then think it's a perfect draft"

I can't say enough about him, he had an amazing attitude considering that everybody in New Orleans at the parade wanted a picture and to shake his hand.  He didn't leave anyone out of the merriment.    WHO DAT!!!"

Saints,2zflcf,OGMoose,6,Wed Mar 18 12:38:25 2015 UTC,Would be a great pick at 31.
Saints,2zflcf,cloud9formations,4,Wed Mar 18 14:23:12 2015 UTC,"I would hate that pick, but I've been wrong before."
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,0,Wed Mar 18 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"If we werent so defense-needy, I'd love this pick. He could be GREAT, he could be a bust. Depends on where he goes, how he's groomed, the locker room, etc.."
Saints,2zflcf,makeplayz,3,Wed Mar 18 17:01:05 2015 UTC,Everyone seems to be down on Shaq Thompson and I think the guy will be a playmaker. He seemed to have fallen to into the 2nd and maybe later and if that happens I think he will outplay his draft slot. He might be undersized but the guy can hit. There have been undersized linebackers who can play in the league and I feel Shaq has the same abilities. He has speed and some coverage abilities as well. With our D constantly in different looks I can see him lining up all over the place.
Saints,2zflcf,Iwouldlikealongeruse,0,Wed Mar 18 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"If he plays edge rusher where he's going against Tackles every play, dude will be a bust. I think he's more of a Polumalu type guy, keep him around the line of scrimmage, let him roam and make plays in the box."
Saints,2zflcf,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:58:25 2015 UTC,I would not use him as an Edge rusher. That part is not his game. He can cover and plays well against the run so I can see him fitting in in that role.
Saints,2zflcf,Iwouldlikealongeruse,6,Wed Mar 18 18:55:07 2015 UTC,I know nothing about college football.
Saints,2zflcf,Andy_Gator,3,Wed Mar 18 20:03:58 2015 UTC,I still want Trae Waynes. We start him in the slot and he gets to learn the position from Keenan Lewis and Brandon Browner until we inevitably lose Browner because he wants to get paid. Who better to learn how to use his size from than an ex-LoB player.
Saints,2zflcf,GifelteFish,3,Wed Mar 18 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"Duke Johnson!! Not sure what other people think of him, but I'd love to see him become a Saint."
Saints,2zflcf,SkaterJohnson45,5,Wed Mar 18 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"The most controversial opinion of mine? If we did that trade with the Bucs of Drew for the 1st overall (and effectively Winston), it might be better for the future of our franchise. I believe Winston will be a stud, and a great qb on a rookie contract is great for an organization, as well as the fact that I think Drew has a max of 3 elite years left."
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,8,Wed Mar 18 14:53:05 2015 UTC,I think Mariota will do better than Winston. Personal opinion.
Saints,2zflcf,xbaited,7,Wed Mar 18 15:19:53 2015 UTC,My personal opinion is that Mariota is almost a sure bust. About as sure as one can reasonably be IMO.
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,6,Wed Mar 18 15:23:04 2015 UTC,To each his own.
Saints,2zflcf,xbaited,4,Wed Mar 18 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"agreed. System QB, weak arm."
Saints,2zflcf,Saints2Death,-2,Wed Mar 18 15:57:45 2015 UTC,Gonna have to disagree here. Winston isn't draft ready. He needed to go back to school for at least another year. His talent as a qb will not be outstanding in the NFL like he hopes it will be. He's extremely immature and has too much to learn. Mariotta is the much more complete qb.
Saints,2zflcf,batmanisfiya,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"I disagree on everything you said. Winston will be miles better than Mariota. Not even close IMO. I don't do bets, but I will save your username and PM you that I told you so when it comes to fruition lol Mariota will be a huge bust, and Winston will be a superstar."
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,6,Wed Mar 18 16:52:14 2015 UTC,"You can tell me you told me so all you want. It's just speculation. I personally have no respect for a man who can't even be trusted by his coaching staff to go to a grocery store by himself because he might steal something. Does that equivilate to football? Not in the slightest, but I think his attitude off the field greatly effects his attitude on the field. And not in a good way. He's about as mature as a 14 year old kid who has decent ability to play football. Mariotta just seems a hell of a lot more ready to be in the NFL than Winston could ever hope to be."
Saints,2zflcf,batmanisfiya,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:58:51 2015 UTC,"His attitude is abrasive to us, but his teammates love him, which is ultimately all that matters in football. He was acquitted of the only charge that was serious against him, and the rest is just a college kid acting like a college kid. He's a smart kid who does dumb things from to time, but that is a stage every guy goes through. He'll get over that because he is hypercompetetive and it's the only way he'll be able to compete.   Mariota is a guy who can run fast, isn't stupid, and can kinda throw a ball. Nothing more. He's a Tebow/Geno Smith/Vince Young kinda guy."
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,2,Wed Mar 18 17:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, and Im not fond of Jameis."
Saints,2zflcf,makeplayz,-1,Wed Mar 18 16:59:35 2015 UTC,The bucs wouldn't give us that deal without probably both of our other firsts as well
Saints,2zflcf,Bouzal,0,Wed Mar 18 14:57:01 2015 UTC,Well that's the deal I was talking about. Drew plus the 2 firsts.
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,7,Wed Mar 18 14:58:37 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a good idea. It would make all our other moves pointless since we're restocking to make a run now
Saints,2zflcf,Bouzal,0,Wed Mar 18 15:01:02 2015 UTC,I think Winston is good enough to start immediately
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,5,Wed Mar 18 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"Start immediately, yes. Be Drew Brees immediately no."
Saints,2zflcf,Bouzal,-1,Wed Mar 18 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"No, but I think he'll be at least top 7 in 3 years. The only starters I don't think will be here in 3 years are Colston and Streif (I assuming Evans is traded this season). By that time I would assume we had found replacements. The rest of the team is young and will have even more experience by that team, and would become perennial Super Bowl favorites."
Saints,2zflcf,Lokipokie504,2,Wed Mar 18 15:22:00 2015 UTC,I like Marshall too.   Lately people seem to think Dupree isn't a top pick and is been bugging me.   I like Kwon Alexander he doesn't get mentioned much. I don't know if anybody else feels about him.
Saints,2zflcf,flordeliest,4,Wed Mar 18 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"Dupree is a beast, would be an amazing pick at 13"
Saints,2zflcf,Dabeston,2,Wed Mar 18 05:51:00 2015 UTC,Justin hardy ecu.  I don't know if he will be any good but he reminds me of Steve smith without the attitude.
Saints,2zflcf,wzmb,2,Wed Mar 18 13:31:05 2015 UTC,"I personally want Bryce Petty or Dupree. Dupree is the highest risk reward pick of all the pass rushers in my opinion. Neither of these qualify as people not liking them, but I feel they aren't considered the ""sexy"" picks in the draft."
Saints,2zflcf,ThatBoiiBryan,2,Wed Mar 18 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"I'm still on the Dupree train with you! If he's at 13 and Scherff, Cooper and White are gone I would hope we take him."
Saints,2zflcf,Brees2Graham,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:26:32 2015 UTC,"I just don't see us taking anyone other than a pass rusher at 13 unless all of the Big 5 are gone (Gregory, Ray, Beasley, Fowler, Dupree), although I'm not that high on Shane Ray. I originally want an O Lineman early but the the Unger trade means we can take a 2nd or 3rd round pick on a guard (Laken Tomlinson, Ali Marpet, or Tre from LSU should be available there)"
Saints,2zflcf,ThatBoiiBryan,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:34:04 2015 UTC,How is Dupree a risk?  Genuine question.    After watching the tape vs Missouri and A&M I was really impressed.  The guy is a terror and totally worth a high draft pick.
Saints,2zflcf,Dabeston,3,Wed Mar 18 17:25:21 2015 UTC,"Many people see him as simply a ""workout warrior"" and a project pick, even though, as you mentioned, he has the game tape and collegiate stats to back it up."
Saints,2zflcf,ThatBoiiBryan,2,Wed Mar 18 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"apparently he's not very technical, and a lot of really athletic pass rushers have been bust because they can't just out athlete people in the NFL. This is something that is hard to see in broadcast games, but shows up in practice and on team film."
Saints,2zflcf,Saints2Death,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:29:35 2015 UTC,I remember being at that Missouri game and remembering Dupree causing an impact on Maty Mauk (although that wasn't that hard last year).

Saints,2zflcf,Samkbutler,3,Thu Mar 19 02:39:01 2015 UTC,Me too but I feel there aren't that many people high on him. If we sat him behind Brees for the next 2-4 years he potentially could become the next face of our franchise
Saints,2zflcf,ThatBoiiBryan,2,Thu Mar 19 06:20:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like a decent number of people have soured on Paul Dawson after his combine, but I still have high hopes for him and would love him at 44.  Also Devin Funchess - if the price is right. He ammended his combine with a 4.47 at his pro day. If we could possibly get him at 75 or 78, I'd take that."
Saints,2zflcf,Brees2Graham,2,Wed Mar 18 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"I think Mariota and Winston are basically Cam Newton deconstructed, and would hate it if we took either of them.  I like Blake Bell a lot as a TE even though he's very raw.  His experience at QB is going to help a lot with developing his routes, and he's already a better blocker than Graham.  He has already proven his ability to run through tackles, and has pretty good hands."

Saints,2zflcf,Saints2Death,3,Wed Mar 18 04:22:08 2015 UTC,I haven't seen him in the third since the combine. And tons of people like Anthony.
Saints,2zflcf,flordeliest,3,Wed Mar 18 05:54:30 2015 UTC,I want us to grab him in the second

Saints,2zed9z,Zynac,3,Tue Mar 17 22:15:59 2015 UTC,He couldn't get on the field much with us due to a seriously crowded backfield.  I have a feeling that Bill will sacrifice a chicken or something and BAM he's in the pro bowl.

Saints,2zd3m2,brokenearth02,14,Tue Mar 17 16:16:27 2015 UTC,"So Kenny Stills: a former 5th rounders maybe starter, more likely 3rd WR (I think Colston and Cooks are 1 and 2) for a 3rd round pick and a starting ILB, essentially replacing Lofton for pennies on dollars. And a 3rd which you can get a decent LB or WR with for rookie scale.  If you accept that Stills was a locker issue, this isn't a good trade this is a GREAT trade. And does Miami get fleeced? No. (Although if Stills is a party animal, South Beach may not be a good place for him. Hope he shows restraint). They got something for Ellerbe and a WR allowing them to jettison Wallace without too much fear (Stills could match Wallace Miami production, not Wallace's production but last year he just didn't do much).  Great trades. This is no fire sale. LooDoo is doing work.   The ONLY thing you worry is ""What if Jimmy is a once in a lifetime uber TE (which lets face it he was 2nd to Gronk in his best year and was like 4th last year)?""

Saints,2ze4o5,bobbyblack,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:44:21 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about buying one of those custom ones where you can put your own name on it.  I've got just as much of a chance to be on the roster by the time the season starts as anyone else currently on the team.

Saints,2ze4o5,zyklon_snuggles,2,Tue Mar 17 22:15:53 2015 UTC,This. This is what I clicked on this thread to suggest.

Ingram has said that he wants to be with the Saints for a while because we traded up in the draft to pick him.  Colston is also our all time best receiver and still active, although he probably won't be around much longer.  Other than those three I might hold off for a little while with the pace this off-season is going."

Saints,2ze4o5,MrWilliam,2,Tue Mar 17 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"Get whatever you want. A lot of people talk about regret on certain jerseys, but the thing is you can rarely predict the result. You're basically making a bet on whether a player you like will have a good career for that team.   If you want to play it safe, though, just get one of a player already retired (Deuce, Roaf) or a player who has had a good, long career already (Brees, Colston).   Just never forget this game is a business first, as this off season has proved. Don't regret a purchase just because a player didn't play his entire career here, because that rarely happens anywhere. Enjoy the time that player was here.  Unless for some odd reason you have an Aaron Brooks jersey, in which case I'm sorry."

He's got a big contract, and if he doesn't start living up to it soon, he could be a cap casualty or a cap-motivated trade in the next year or two.  It's hard to say who will be here in the future, so I'd go with someone who has been here for a while. Brees, Colston, maybe Evans. Or go old school with McAllister, McKenzie, Roaf, etc."

Saints,2zdtpx,TheRage469,18,Tue Mar 17 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone write us off next season? Any time you have an elite qb, you have a chance. I think I we genuinely got better as a team. We'll end up trading or cutting Evans, and we'll make another FA pick up, probably a role player. We don't need Jimmy. He was a luxury. Payton's scheme can make any half decent receiver look great, and you'll see that next season. Our offense will always be top 10 with Brees at the helm. Our season hinges on the defense. I have faith that Byrd will re-establish himself as a top 5-10 FS at least, and the addition of Browner solidifies our biggest weakness on defense. He will also help us shut Jimmy down if we were to meet Yall in the playoffs. We still need to find another LB and maybe add another pass rusher, but if Gallette and Jordan play to their potential with Haralson spelling, we should be fine in that aspect as well. I fully expect for us to win the NFC South, and make a decent run in the playoffs."
Saints,2zdtpx,Lokipokie504,2,Tue Mar 17 19:54:42 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was trying to tell them. I honestly think they're just in shock since many of them saw Jimmy as another face of the franchise. But in all honesty, I'm 100% confident that they can bounce back. You hit every point that I was trying to make."
Saints,2zdtpx,Lokipokie504,3,Tue Mar 17 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"Jimmy is an amazing athlete. But, he's not hard. I honestly think he'll struggle in your division due to the absolutely tough games yall play (although he does play Arizona well). I wish him the best, but he is not essential to the saints success by any means. Our best game last season he didn't even have a target. Payton's offense makes stars out of anyone, and I'm certain we'll find a replacement. I like Josh hill, and he'll be able to put up 80% of Jimmy's production at the least."
Saints,2zdtpx,Lokipokie504,3,Tue Mar 17 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"The main issues I see with him is that he has difficulty blocking and a hard-playing, physical defense is enough to make him a non-factor. That being said, I think he'll excel in our system, thanks to the triple threat of him, Wilson, and Lynch. And yeah, your team wrecks shit with or without him. Yes, he's a big and great receiving threat, but you have Brees. With a good pocket (which Unger will help bring), he can turn anyone into that sort of threat"
Saints,2zdtpx,ThatBoiiBryan,2,Tue Mar 17 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"Jimmy will score a lot of td's for yall. In goal line situations, split him out wide and run the read-option with a corner fade back up plan and it will be damn near impossible to stop it. However, as big and strong as Jimmy is, he is not that good after the catch. He doesn't break many tackles and shoes away from contact. He's a finesse player in a maulers body. I expect him to disappear in your games against St. Louis, do well against Arizona, and I have no clue who the 49ers will have on their team next year so that's an unknown lol he is a hindrance in the run game, but I could see a shit load of big plays from him while Wilson does that crazy scrambling of his."
Saints,2zdtpx,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:20:52 2015 UTC,"I see him being able to break away more often, even against St. Louis and Arizona, simply because of Wilson's ability to scramble. While, yes, he's basically forced to scramble on nearly every snap, he also has that nasty habit of just taking off. I figure we can run a few plays that involve him faking out the defense, disrupting the coverage on Graham for even a second, then having Wilson whip it to him for a solid gain."
Saints,2zdtpx,ThatBoiiBryan,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"I agree 100% but I believe Evans would be best to take a pay cut, rather than the trade/cut route because he still is good, just had an injury plagued down year"

I don't think they were bad moves by any means and if Sean Payton believes the team is better off this way I believe it. Last years 7-9 team needs a shakeup so I'm glad we're not creeping into the off-season hoping we get it turned around. I don't think we'll be an elite team, but I believe we'll be solid and go in maybe as a wildcard team."

Saints,2zdtpx,sfzen,2,Wed Mar 18 07:43:50 2015 UTC,"I always believe that we are a super bowl contender. Looking at our schedule we don't have a very tough schedule, as of now, so something like 11-5 or 12-4 isn't outta the question, but it depends if our team can put it all together amidst all the changes. Brees will be Brees no matter the starting cast, but the question is now ""will our defense be a quality NFL defense"""
Saints,2zdtpx,colby347_1,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:40:15 2015 UTC,"Our biggest issue last year was consistency on both sides of the ball. One week we'd look outstanding and the next we'd be hopeless. A good QB-TE connection, while fantastic to watch, is not what makes an offense consistent. Consistency starts on the offensive line.  I'm not going to make many predictions until I see what we get in the first 3 rounds of the draft though. I feel like I can't even comprehend moving Graham and Stills until I see how we replace them."
Saints,2zdtpx,ozarka83,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Ideally? We embrace the ""character movement"" and go into the season motivated and ready to play. If the defense can be just average, and our offense picks up where we left off and doesn't miss Graham too much, we can go 11-5, easily take the division title, and go for a playoff run.  Realistically? Probably something similar to our record this past year, right around 8-8. We fill some holes in the draft, go into the season with a few weak spots that we try to minimize, and pray to god Brees can carry the team. Again, we can still win the division. We were fucking terrible last season, and we were only half a game behind Carolina. It's not like we're in the AFCE with the Patriots dominating every year. Even if we aren't much better than last year, we should still expect to challenge for a division title.  That said, I do think this season is a statement year that will define the team's foreseeable future. If we rally and succeed, it's a huge step in whatever rebuilding/not-rebuilding process we're in. If we flop, I expect the big cap moves will continue in the next offseason, and we might be looking at a real rebuilding process that could take a few years to sort out."

Saints,2zchsz,pottersquash,5,Tue Mar 17 13:43:51 2015 UTC,that's a BIG paycut this season.  $7.4 million dollar cut this year
Saints,2zchsz,Andy_Gator,3,Tue Mar 17 13:48:43 2015 UTC,"Welp Evans or Galette are on the block. Unless  Brees agrees to lay on his sword. Evans and Galette are the last big contracts on players we can live without.  Jordan and Vaccaro would be moved  for none cap issues cause those are good contracts. Jordan probably  has more trade value (and due a big contract next year), Vaccaro has bad rumors and digressed last year."

Saints,2zchsz,brokenearth02,6,Tue Mar 17 16:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think with Ellerbe it's Jeff Ireland getting him to take this paycut. Ireland was his biggest fan in Miami, and I'm sure he mentioned to Ellerbe that a paycut is better than simply getting cut and making no money, as was reported to be the case had he stayed in Miami."
Saints,2zcl41,IAmA_scientist2,13,Tue Mar 17 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone is keen to forget that Jimmy Graham was completely raw when he was drafted and the Saints coaching staff helped mold him into what he is today, so whats to say the same can't done for Josh Hill.   edit; Also as comparisons go Hill reminds me of Aaron Hernandez more than Graham."

Saints,2zcl41,mankstar,1 point,Thu Mar 19 18:26:08 2015 UTC,"He did alright, but wasn't asked too much during his time filling in for Graham."
Saints,2zcl41,thatEhden,11,Thu Mar 19 18:36:07 2015 UTC,He can step up for sure. The thing is that we're going to be hoping for the next Jimmy Graham in everyone and it just won't happen. He's one of the best tight ends in the game and unfortunately we can't just make another. It will suck losing him but I thibk Hill can help soften the loss a bit.
Saints,2zcl41,IReallyLikeFootball,6,Tue Mar 17 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah the tools are all there, he's a bit undersized weight wise but that's fine since he won't be used as a blocking tight end either. Also, even though hes about a tenth of a second slower than Graham, he's still pretty fast for his position going against LBs and an increased emphasis on the run game and play-action passes should really help Hill out in the short passing game."
Saints,2zcl41,dean815,4,Tue Mar 17 16:32:02 2015 UTC,I don't think he's done anything but good stuff on the field. Good nose for the endzone and surprising athleticism. Should do nicely and I dont think they'll be overreaching for a replacement anytime soon.
Saints,2zcl41,freshestpr1nce,3,Tue Mar 17 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"Drew makes even average receivers look great, we'll be fine."
Saints,2zcl41,DiNovi,8,Tue Mar 17 19:25:16 2015 UTC,"No, he can't, be he can contribute to it. Which is all we should expect really."
Saints,2zcl41,colby347_1,4,Tue Mar 17 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"This is, at best, a very long reach. Assumptions are made from a very small sample size. On paper, the similarities are evident but anyone can tell you that doesn't equate to performance on the field. We'll see if he can it done this year. My guess is half of Grahams receptions will be replaced by rushing attempts anyway."
Saints,2zcl41,symko,1 point,Tue Mar 17 16:59:23 2015 UTC,I fully expect Ingram to be a workhorse in our Oline but it won't slip us up because Brees will throw it to anyone whose open.
Saints,2zcl41,swamptech,2,Tue Mar 17 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"All he has to do is fill the role of Mark Campbell / Billy Miller. This offense thrived before Graham, y'know"
Saints,2zcl41,sophandros,3,Wed Mar 18 01:06:25 2015 UTC,I think we'd all be happy with 60 catches (just under 4 a game) for 800 yards (~13 yards per catch) and 8 touchdowns from Hill.
Saints,2zcl41,Saints2Death,2,Tue Mar 17 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"I think Hill can be good, but let's be honest, Graham has been putting up future hall of fame numbers. Teams just don't have those guys waiting on the bench."
Saints,2zcl41,haledann,2,Tue Mar 17 18:03:17 2015 UTC,Drew makes everyone look good.
Saints,2zcl41,DiNovi,2,Tue Mar 17 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"I dont know, Drew forced it to Jimmy a lot. there were quite a few plays where Jimmy made Drew look good"
Saints,2zcl41,Saints2Death,3,Tue Mar 17 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"a lot is pretty subjective. I will agree Brees did force throws to Jimmy, but outside of jump passes in the end zone, I didn't see a lot of passes where I thought ""only Jimmy Graham could catch that pass."""
Saints,2zcl41,DiNovi,2,Tue Mar 17 21:07:57 2015 UTC,drew brees also threw it to jimmy a lot where even jimmy couldnt catch it too :p
Saints,2zcl41,Saints2Death,5,Tue Mar 17 21:09:44 2015 UTC,That's not a uniquely Brees/Graham phenomenon. That's just a bad pass.

We had the best team in the league that year.  But for Jenkins and Harper not being able to cover anybody.  The refs allowed the 9ers.defense to mug our guys,  and of course a few months later Goodell unleashed his witch hunt publicly as he had unleashed the rules privately.

Saints,2z97rr,Darryl_Strawberry,62,Mon Mar 16 18:00:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jimmy was a character issue, Stills was. What I suspect happened was Stills was being shopped and Seahawks showed interest. Only guy Saints wanted though was Unger. Seahawks didn't like that trade and wanted Saints to sweeten witha 4th which Saints balked. They go back and forth, offering Vaccaro or Galette finally Loomis just asks ""Who would make this work?"" Seahawks say Jimmy Graham, Saints say only with your 1st. They give each other a minute to think and both sides realize this is a crazy deal because it actually makes sense: Pro Bowl player + 1st = HOF + 4th. Math is perfect. You can't turn down the deal because it is an equal trade. They each take a shot and get it done.  Now onto Stills. Saints know Miami wants to dump Wallace but don't want to do it for nothing. They offer Stills for a 2nd (Starting WR with a great contract). Miami wants to play hardball and offers just a third. Saints know they are getting screwed but then new hire Ireland remembers that Ellerbe contract so they say ""hey toss him in, you don't want him anyway."" Miami is like ""Waste of time you can't afford him it won't be approved."" Ireland is like no worries, calls the agent ""Hey remember when I gave you that big contract and told you it would need to be restructured? Well, if you agree to do it now, guy can start on a Drew Brees team rather than proving himself elsewhere. Where else is there a starting ILB position just waiting for you?"" They get it done."

Saints,2z97rr,devparso,2,Mon Mar 16 23:34:42 2015 UTC,For some reason even though he wasn't mentioned I just picture Pete Carroll doing a pimp dance in the background.
Saints,2z97rr,thatEhden,7,Tue Mar 17 17:02:02 2015 UTC,"Character concern may be a little strong regarding Jimmy. However, I still think that getting flagged in scrimmages, then twice in the preseason, for something he knew he was being watched for, was selfish. We can talk about how those games were meaningless, but I think that ""me-first"" attitude is also capable of rubbing off on the rest of the team, especially rookies/newcomers who are trying to gauge the team's culture.  Not saying this is why he was dealt, but I don't think it's a stretch to assume it left a bad taste in the mouths of the front office and coaching staff. And I think that it made the decision to part ways with him (for a no-nonsense Super Bowl champion) slightly easier."
Saints,2z97rr,ImShadier,15,Mon Mar 16 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"To me, Jimmy didn't exactly seem like an ""effort"" guy.  He has natural athleticism and talent, but it frequently looked like he relied on that heavily and other areas of the game be damned. I've never once seen him try hard and fail at run blocking; it was always just matador mode. I'd take a guy with average natural gifts and abilities who works tirelessly to become a good all around player over Jimmy any day of the week. It's the Drew Brees model.  Edit: words."

Saints,2z97rr,Saints2Death,17,Tue Mar 17 10:53:08 2015 UTC,"I think the moves are about character issues, but it's also about our current system not working any more and needing to change. SP is a good enough coach to realize that doing the same thing over and over again with the same people have gotten us no where in the past three season.   We had a good run from 2009-2011, but escalating contracts have destroyed any depth and future talent we were developing, and the fact the we've pretty much have done the same thing offensively for a decade and getting diminishing results. The Rams had around a three year window of great success with the Greatest Show on Turf, and we got about the same with it, but have held on to the model too long.  It's an identity change in the locker room, but also on the field."
Saints,2z97rr,Saints2Death,8,Mon Mar 16 18:12:42 2015 UTC,"Great points. I think we are in the second offseason of a move towards a power run, ball control, play action kind of offense. When we dealt Sproles last year, I felt this signaled that we were moving on from what we had grown to know as Payton's offense.  Unfortunately, I don't think we built the proper offensive line to accommodate this shift in scheme, so we ended up reverting back to our old ways, but without Sproles, who was very unique and important to that ""old"" offensive philosophy.   Injuries and other factors (like the locker room stuff) contributed, but I think it was plain to see that we lacked an identity last year."
Saints,2z97rr,FedorRedDevil,2,Mon Mar 16 18:20:38 2015 UTC,As long as we're paying a QB $26M a year we won't be a power running game. I do think we will be more balanced and see us create plays of play action as well as move back to the Sproles/Bush dynamic with Spiller as a passing down back.
Saints,2z97rr,Jesus_Oregon,2,Mon Mar 16 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Right, I guess I could have phrased that better. Move towards ""more of"" a running team. Something along the lines of the Broncos attack - feature your franchise QB, but give him a running game to play off of.   Brees is killer with that pump fake deep ball. Being able to keep teams on their toes with the play action pump fake, the threat of both a run up the gut or an 80 yard bomb, is what we should be working towards."
Saints,2z97rr,TimVicious,8,Mon Mar 16 20:44:12 2015 UTC,"I made a post about this the other day, but yours is much more put together. I agree a thousand percent with what you are saying. Something about this team last year was off, they were unlikeable almost. And when Vaccaro was benched at the end of the year, and Stills was celebrating his catches while we were getting trounced, I knew that attitude was a problem.  I respect the hell out of Payton and Loomis for making this tough changes. It would have been easy to go into this year and just hope that the talent wins out, but clearly they are trying to build a tough, smart team. And they are taking risks to do so. I respect that and am proud to have an organization that doesn't just sit on its laurels and expect things to change."
Saints,2z97rr,brokenearth02,4,Mon Mar 16 18:17:10 2015 UTC,I can't help but feel like Bill Parcell's fingerprints are on these moves too.
Saints,2z97rr,tygerbrees,3,Mon Mar 16 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm too late, but I am getting excited as hell! I want to see Unger contribute to the O line because even though we dealt Graham and Stills, Brees still has plenty of weapons.  I feel like Marques Colston will become relevant again, Cooks is a great speed guy, Nick Toon is another big body receiver, and I dont think Josh Hill was ever noticed when standing in the shadow of Jimmy Graham.  In my opinion, these guys will all have awesome years as far as the passing game, but we can't forget the resigning of Mark Ingram who could become a monster runningback and CJ Spiller to back him up!  As for the defense, We have arguably the best Cornerback pair in the league now that we have Browner and Lewis (please note i said arguably haha). Hopefully Byrd is healthy and can contribute, because our secondary is looking scary (Domeland Security?).    Also, we are in a good position with draft picks and hopefully we can fill any holes that we have.  Like I said, I'm excited as hell!"

Saints,2z97rr,sophandros,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:39:58 2015 UTC,"trying too hard to find a theory - best for case by case analysis  Pierre and Lofton certainly were not lockerroom problems. And if Jimmy turned into one, that's entirely on the Saints. He was a blank slate, wide-eyed puppy dog when he got here. If he changed that's on us  it's much more likely (and more boring) they did a cost benefit analysis: ""Ben, we need you to take a paycut"" ""No"" ""We'll help you pack"""
Saints,2z97rr,SwampNerd,2,Mon Mar 16 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"Just saying that it seems we are making a more concerted effort to acquire the ""right types"" of guys and getting rid of those that aren't bought in.   It's a general theme I've picked up on, not an all-inclusive rule. Another theme of this offseason, as you mentioned, has been cutting costs. I think Lofton fits under cap casualty, Stills under culture change, and Jimmy somewhere in the middle."

Saints,2zalk9,cheetah_kibbles,4,Tue Mar 17 02:10:43 2015 UTC,Great #2 WR and a solid deep threat. Route running could be better. Hopefully the trade woke him up and he cuts down on the partying and gives a little more effort in Miami.

Saints,2zalk9,Bouzal,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:14:52 2015 UTC,"He is actually quite similar to Mike Wallace as a player. 6'0"" pure deep threats. I think Wallace has a little better ball skills but Stills is every bit the home run hitter that Wallace was.   I don't think it's coincidence that you guys flipped Wallace almost immediately after acquiring Stills. Y'all were able to dump two huge salaries in Ellerbee and Wallace to help pay for the Suh contract, and didn't lose the speed dimension that Mike offered."

Saints,2za0wk,NewRedditorHere,19,Mon Mar 16 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"He's definitely in the 2nd tier somewhere around Romo and Rivers. He's a great QB, just not elite. I think a lot of people view him as a choker, similar to Manning's reputation throughout his career. He reminds me of Cam, in the sense that he came out swinging but hasn't lived up to the high hopes set by his initial emergence. I remember Ryan's first pass, it was for a long TD. But Brees didn't really solidify his elite label until his 8th season so maybe Ryan will prove us all wrong."
Saints,2za0wk,quantumhed,7,Mon Mar 16 21:40:51 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Not quite on a level with Manning, Rodgers, Brady, and Brees, but right behind them. He has a good long game and even his short passes can look impressive. I think he has plenty of room to improve as he is not the most aware and tends to dance in the pocket when his first choice isn't an option but that just takes some time to gain that QB instinct."
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,6,Mon Mar 16 22:28:25 2015 UTC,I've always thought about what kind of QB Ryan would be under Sean Payton.
Saints,2za0wk,quantumhed,4,Mon Mar 16 22:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is really scary. Just think him being molded and trained just like Brees. Under Payton and with weapons like Graham, Colston, Bush, Sproles, and everyone else. I can't even tell where the ceiling would be on Ryan."
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,4,Mon Mar 16 22:40:01 2015 UTC,"Could you imagine Brees with Julio Jones, Tony Gonzalez, Roddy White, and Harry Douglass? Ryan has always had superior targets than Brees and has done less with them."
Saints,2za0wk,PABLOricardo,4,Mon Mar 16 23:19:28 2015 UTC,"I will give you Jones and Gonzalez, but at some point you have to admit that Brees has had great receivers for what our style offense is. You can't dismiss Colston and Graham as great receivers though. I wasn't trying to say that we have better receivers or they have better receivers, but just trying to imagine where Ryan would be with Payton and our core."
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,2,Mon Mar 16 23:24:40 2015 UTC,"Brees makes his receivers look much better than they are. He's never had a pro bowl WR the whole time he's been a Saint. He's had better receiving RBs to use in the screen and play action, but with the exception of Graham, no one really that great to throw at."
Saints,2za0wk,PABLOricardo,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:24:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I give you that but I mean the scheme that we used is built to make any QB look good. Unless we had a shit all receiving group it wouldn't matter. and I'm just trying to say imagine Matt Ryan in the same role. If Ryan was in SP scheme how would he do. I personally don't think it would be far off from what Brees is doing. maybe more turnovers, but still."
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,15,Tue Mar 17 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"Rob Ryan, love the guy.  Joking aside, I'd probably put Matt Ryan top 10."
Saints,2za0wk,xspinkickx,2,Mon Mar 16 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"I put Ryan #6... behind Brady, Manning, Rodgers, Brees, and Romo."
Saints,2za0wk,stillcasey,2,Tue Mar 17 09:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'd still put Rivers, Big Ben, other Manning, and Luck (not in that order) ahead of him."
Saints,2za0wk,daybreaker,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:14:02 2015 UTC,Can you give us your whole top ten? I'm just curious.
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,6,Mon Mar 16 23:32:35 2015 UTC,2nd tier qb with a decent o-line. 3rd tier without one.
Saints,2za0wk,Lokipokie504,1 point,Mon Mar 16 21:41:14 2015 UTC,Who would you put right ahead of him without and O-line?
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:33:11 2015 UTC,"Rivers, Wilson, Luck, Ben, Romo (plus the big 4)"
Saints,2za0wk,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:32:46 2015 UTC,Is it in that order cause I might mix that up a bit ( just my opinion).
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:17:33 2015 UTC,"Nah, not that order. Just was going off the top of my head lol"
Saints,2za0wk,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:21:22 2015 UTC,okay then I agree with you completely. But just to pick your brain what do you think about Luck and his future.
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:23:46 2015 UTC,Luck will surpass Rodgers as the best QB in the league in 2 seasons if he gets serious weapons
Saints,2za0wk,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"See I am conflicted because I feel like that is a bold statement, but I completely agree with you."
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:47:13 2015 UTC,"Of all the people mentioned, he has the least talent around him. He makes mistakes, but he overcomes them. If you went into a lab and made the perfect QB, he would pop out. It might be bold, but I'm sticking to it."
Saints,2za0wk,Lokipokie504,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:09:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't know about the least talent part but I do feel like he will be a QB that makes his receivers better than what they are. I think he will definitely make canton and be one of the greats just like Manning and everyone else.
Saints,2za0wk,devparso,4,Tue Mar 17 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone here. 2nd tier and definitely a franchise quarterback. He can make an offense work at an elite level when he has the right targets (White, Jones, Gonzalez). Not necessarily a guy that turns average receivers into household names."
Saints,2za0wk,watchout4mikem,4,Mon Mar 16 21:53:07 2015 UTC,"He's a solid second tier QB that I will only hate on when someone tries to put him in the top.   He has good numbers, but so does about 10 other QB. What keeps him out of the top tier is although he does have good stats, he's never led the league in any important category and he's shit the bed a lot in the playoffs.   Until he wins a ring, MVP, breaks a record, or leads several major categories, he's always going to be a second tier guy."
Saints,2za0wk,Saints2Death,4,Mon Mar 16 23:16:37 2015 UTC,I don't hate Matt Ryan... I hate Roddy White.
Saints,2za0wk,baconlovr,3,Mon Mar 16 22:48:18 2015 UTC,I could see that.  Ha.
Saints,2za0wk,xbaited,2,Tue Mar 17 16:37:58 2015 UTC,Top 10 for sure.
Saints,2za0wk,BaronVonStevie,2,Mon Mar 16 21:41:33 2015 UTC,he's young and very sharp. he needs a better line to help him reach the next level. I think he's had such little to work with there for so long that it's affected his confidence especially in big games. he gets a little mistakey
Saints,2za0wk,Salamanderfs,2,Mon Mar 16 22:03:45 2015 UTC,"Matt Ryan gets rattled way too easily, and I echo the other comments of him not being able to single-handedly take the game into his hands and lead his men down the field for the winning score. He's young and sharp, and has a good arm, I expect him to get better when he has a good O-Line."
Saints,2za0wk,Twistify804,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"He's a top 10 QB in the NFL, probably around 8-9 on the same level as Romo, Rivers, Big Ben, Wilson."
Saints,2za0wk,VegasSaint9,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:30:06 2015 UTC,If I had to make a top ten (top 5 or so in no order really) Brady Brees Rodgers Manning Luck Roethlisberger Romo Rivers Ryan Stafford So about 9th ish? He has games where he's elite and then he has games where he looks like a rookie. So i wouldnt say its ability hindering him but more so consistency.
Saints,2za0wk,platypuspracticus,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"Matt Ryan? I don't think he lives up to the hype that /r/nfl shows for him. He's a serviceable QB that needed 2 pro bowl receivers and a HoF TE to really look as good as he looked. He doesn't elevate the guys around him and not the kind of guy like Peyton or Brees where you can just about take someone off the street and they'll work him up to speed (or have him traded off the team).  I think he's a lot like Philip Rivers where he's given more credit than what's due but he's also not horrible, either.  Or to put it another way: I'd never target him in fantasy football as anything other than a mid-draft QB2 pick."
Saints,2za0wk,omnamename,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:12:40 2015 UTC,"I've never been scared of him getting the ball late in a game, just his receivers, if that makes sense."
Saints,2za0wk,platypuspracticus,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:19:03 2015 UTC,"QB's I'd put above Ryan: Stafford, Luck, Brady, Brees, Rodgers, Wilson, Romo, Roethlisberger...and he's basically in a four-way tie with Flacco, Rivers, and Palmer."
Saints,2za0wk,RPMcMikey,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"Well, he usually does well against us, so yeah, he's a top ten guy, it would be a lot easier to put him in the 5ish spot if he had more playoff experience or a Super Bowl appearance. You guys got yourself a fine QB."
Saints,2za0wk,brokenearth02,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:08:53 2015 UTC,"If he's got protection, he's very dangerous. Top 10 easily."
Saints,2za0wk,pottersquash,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:46:19 2015 UTC,"Lot of talent, don't  know if he has the killer instinct/drive to lead his team. Think Falcobs are in serious  jeopardy of Julio becoming the undisputed  best player/team leader. Name one WR lead team has ever been anything  but disappointing? You can easily erase a WR from a game."
Saints,2za0wk,cajungator3,1 point,Tue Mar 17 14:16:54 2015 UTC,He is better than Jake Locker.
Saints,2za0wk,Zynac,1 point,Tue Mar 17 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"I would call him a rich mans Jim Kelly.  All stats, no rings."
Saints,2za0wk,Jaime-Foxx,0,Tue Mar 17 23:36:33 2015 UTC,I like the guy. That's partly because I don't feel too threatened by him. He's a great quarterback but he can't win a game by himself (like a Luck or Newton). With the right pieces in place I think he can be a really great QB.
Saints,2za0wk,makeplayz,0,Mon Mar 16 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"I could talk forever about Matt Ryan, but I wont. But I will say this: He's been ill-appointed the nickname ""Matty-Ice,"" yet, he's done nothing in his career to exemplify that there's ice in his veins......"
Saints,2z8hvc,Bouzal,19,Mon Mar 16 14:40:54 2015 UTC,I'll be so sad if Cameron Jordan is dealt
Saints,2z8hvc,neovenator250,3,Mon Mar 16 15:39:34 2015 UTC,"Me too, buddy. Me too. I'll have to buy an Ingram jersey I guess."
Saints,2z8hvc,Agilability,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"What does it take to get him in a Bears uniform? The way I see it Pace is still friendly with Loomis and the Saints may be hard pressed re-sign him next year. He had a down year, the Bears have a huge need at 5T, and it is pretty much trade Jordan or cut Evans right? Lose both starting guards or a guy you might lose next year anyway? Does a 3rd sound reasonable?"
Saints,2z8hvc,dmfaber1,2,Mon Mar 16 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"If the Saints want him back, it honestly wouldn't be difficult for us to keep him.  He's the only major free agent for us next year IIRC.  Its a matter of wanting him back or not.  I don't know what teams are valuing him at, but I doubt they take a 3rd rounder for him if they want to trade him.  He's a pretty valuable piece with 20 sacks in the last two seasons and probably our best defender vs. the run."
Saints,2z8hvc,neovenator250,2,Mon Mar 16 21:24:18 2015 UTC,Does a 3rd sound reasonable?   I'd hope we'd ask for a lot more than that. I don't think a 3rd is reasonable for a player that is one year removed from a Pro Bowl appearance and really shows no reason to doubt his return to form.  How about a first and a third and a conditional 2nd next year.
Saints,2z8hvc,platypuspracticus,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"The #7 pick, #71, and a conditional future 2nd? Man that's like QB trade demands. Jordan is good, but even if the Saints didn't have cap problems and future concerns about re-signing him that is waaaaay too much. Ngata went for a 4th and a 5th for pretty much the same reasons. Jordan is 5 years younger, but the Ravens weren't in nearly as desperate a situation."
Saints,2z8hvc,dmfaber1,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:29:22 2015 UTC,"Ngata is also 31 and his career is tapering off as opposed to Jordan at 25 and his performance is still on the uptick.   Also, Jordan (5) has almost as many forced fumbles as Ngata (6) in half the time and more sacks. Ngata has 25.5 sacks in 9 years of play, Jordan has 29 in 4 years.  edit: Also, forgot how high up you were in the draft. Apologies. 2nd, 3rd, and conditional future 2nd."
Saints,2z8hvc,platypuspracticus,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe if the Saints had any leverage and Jordan still had a couple years left on a cheap deal, but that is still more than the 49ers got for Alex Smith a couple years ago. The question is, can the Saints afford to keep Jordan? Is there a scenario where they don't have to trade Jordan or cut Evans to get under the cap this year? Losing Evans and Grubbs would be almost insurmountable for a short QB like Brees unless you guys have some top tier guard prospects lined up. Especially if you know you can't afford Jordan after this year anyway. The #71 pick the bears could offer in the third is a substantial upgrade over the compensary pick they would get the following year if they had to let him walk. And it could allow them to keep Evans."
Saints,2z8hvc,dmfaber1,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:07:48 2015 UTC,"No. First rounder. 2nd at the least, and I wouldn't be happy about it."
Saints,2z8hvc,sfzen,6,Tue Mar 17 02:46:15 2015 UTC,Please. Stop. I can't do this anymore.
Saints,2z8hvc,typical0,6,Mon Mar 16 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"NOOOOO!!! I LOVE CAM JORDAN!! He brings a sense of toughness and swag when his game is on. He just had a rough and very off 2014 season, please please I want him to stay! Unless he's got some lingering physical health issues or really can't gel with the team for the next couple of years I don't see why they'd let him go. He's young, tough and he has shown that he can blow up an OL and get to the QB."
Saints,2z8hvc,Salamanderfs,6,Mon Mar 16 17:11:40 2015 UTC,"At the Greenbrier he saw my nine year old daughter waiting for his autograph and he said, ""what you want, little princess?"" in such a nice voice that I can't possibly not like the guy.  On the other hand, I was rocking a Vaccaro jersey and noted how many other players eyed it suspiciously.. I knew there were players on the team that didn't like him from that alone."
Saints,2z8hvc,dbd1963,2,Mon Mar 16 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"For real, that attitude is what made me buy Cam's jersey. I was sold the minute I saw his mic'd up game."

Saints,2z8hvc,Guyote_,20,Mon Mar 16 15:01:45 2015 UTC,Shit I wanna keep Vaccarro and Jordan. Vaccarro needs another year
Saints,2z8hvc,Lokipokie504,15,Mon Mar 16 15:11:15 2015 UTC,"He goes out ALL the time. Before we lost the Jets game 2 years ago, my friend saw him at Masquerades the night before the were supposed to fly out and he was getting drunk. If he goes, I think it's a character issue more than on the field. If we trade galette, idk how much we'll get for him with that contract."

Saints,2z8hvc,djmcintyre,4,Mon Mar 16 15:34:53 2015 UTC,I think that was part of the reason they traded Stills - Maybe that was a message to Kenny V and the other youngins to step their shit up and be a professional.
Saints,2z8hvc,KarmaPoIice,2,Mon Mar 16 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Doesn't surprise me but I still like how he can play on the field. And seeing him and Browner together would be sick. I get it if it's about character, but I'd like to think he could change and be back to how he played his rookie season"

Saints,2z8hvc,Lokipokie504,8,Mon Mar 16 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Character issue, or just being a young kid who needs to grow up a bit. At that age I did the same thing sometimes, stay out partying all night and go to work a wreck the next morning. He can be worked with and grow out of it, many people make those same mistakes at 22 or 23 years old and move on."
Saints,2z8hvc,Wadzilla2000,4,Mon Mar 16 15:35:46 2015 UTC,I agree. I'm just putting that out there because it's a possibility. Maybe they warned him and he didn't listen? It wouldn't be a big deal if he wasn't playing so terribly last year.
Saints,2z8hvc,Twistify804,2,Mon Mar 16 15:38:15 2015 UTC,I would hope we don't get rid of him on the cheap because of it.
Saints,2z8hvc,Darryl_Strawberry,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think that last sentence is necessarily correct, because Stills played great last year and he got traded."

Saints,2z8hvc,NewOrleansTaints,2,Mon Mar 16 15:22:21 2015 UTC,I feel like it'd be a good thing to have him during a contract year when he's playing to make some big money in 2016.

Saints,2z8hvc,platypuspracticus,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:46:00 2015 UTC,@LyonsYellin:   2015-03-16 13:08:15 UTC  I'm told by a league source the #saints aren't done making moves just yet. They're still shopping players and another deal expected soon.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
Saints,2z8hvc,swamptech,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"Damn, I like Jordan and Vaccaro. They're both pretty decent players. I honestly don't know how this works, but if it's locker room crap I think the coaches should talk to them. If they don't get it, then trade them but wait and see if they mature."
Saints,2z8hvc,neovenator250,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:50:36 2015 UTC,"If it was locker room for Jordan, I'd think we would have heard about it by now. New Orleans is a city that's actually a small town. Any kind of shit would get out eventually."
Saints,2z8hvc,crawfish2013,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"If Galette goes, I dont think this off season couldve gone any better"
Saints,2z8hvc,dieselpow3r3d,1 point,Mon Mar 16 16:36:02 2015 UTC,more expensive to trade him than keep him after they changed his roster bonus
Saints,2z8hvc,evtine,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:53:13 2015 UTC,I wish the Saints could get rid of Byrd but his dead cap hit probably stops him from being moved
Saints,2z8hvc,ThatBoiiBryan,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:11:49 2015 UTC,wouldn't shock me to hear it was Vacarro based on everything so far.
Saints,2z8hvc,djmcintyre,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"Gallette isn't going anywhere. The cap hit would be too large and when it comes down to it, he is a pretty great pass rusher. And those are hard to come by. They'll have to get over whatever problems he's having and do what they can to fix them.   I think Vaccarro has too much potential to trade. But I thought the same with Stills so I don't know. But he seems to be getting his head on straight and trying to become a leader.  Evans, to me, depends on how he decides he wants to restructure his contract. If he doesn't want to take the number they give him, he'll be gone.   The same goes for Cam, but with his extension talks. If he wants elite money, he can get the hell outta here. But I think we keep him unless there are behind-the-scenes concerns with him too. Worst case scenario he walks next offseason and we get a compensatory pick in 2017."
Saints,2z8hvc,VegasSaint9,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:40:30 2015 UTC,I really hope we don't trade Jordan unless it is a ridiculously good deal for us. I'm talking 1st bare minimum. Jordan has been one of the few good 1st round picks we've had in awhile
Saints,2z8hvc,Whipplashes,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"What are the chances we could shop Vaccaro for a solid edge rusher, then pick up Landon Collins at 13?"
Saints,2z8hvc,blueboybob,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:50:48 2015 UTC,Still waiting on this news....
Saints,2z8hvc,daybreaker,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:22:50 2015 UTC,I would be more than happy to give up Gallette for a good deal. He just seems like more of a problem than hes worth.
Saints,2z8sgv,yenney92,57,Mon Mar 16 16:07:20 2015 UTC,Patrick Robinson's receiver is also still open.
Saints,2z8sgv,captoe_slim,2,Mon Mar 16 17:08:41 2015 UTC,I wish I had gold for you
Saints,2z8sgv,SeaOfSourMilk,19,Tue Mar 17 03:40:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't mind him sitting behind Lewis and Browner as a solid backup. He showed some skills late last season and as long as he's not a starter, I have no problem with him coming back."
Saints,2z8sgv,baconlovr,12,Mon Mar 16 16:17:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Seem like when pressure was on him he would fold. But if you let him play nickel, he has great skills."
Saints,2z8sgv,pottersquash,2,Mon Mar 16 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"yeah, the decision to switch him off nickel was boneheaded! He had a decent 2012 season and showed flashes, developed further in 2013 and then took a huge step backward last season. I know we want diverse speedy guys but I guess just playing nickel is not an option for him with Ryan's frequently changing schemes."
Saints,2z8sgv,Salamanderfs,2,Mon Mar 16 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. He's a good enough 3rd or 4th CB, he just shouldn't be starting. I'd be perfectly happy to have him back for the right price."
Saints,2z8sgv,sfzen,2,Mon Mar 16 20:50:15 2015 UTC,So you mean for free?
Saints,2z8sgv,heisLegend,2,Tue Mar 17 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"I mean something under $1 mil cap hit. So...yeah, kinda."
Saints,2z8sgv,sfzen,9,Tue Mar 17 02:08:51 2015 UTC,"I would not be surprised to see him added a depth signing after releasing Corey White.  Honestly, I don't know how I would get along without yelling at him a couple times every Sunday.  The last few years have really made it a tradition for me..."

Saints,2z8sgv,Easybrees09,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:01:58 2015 UTC,"He can play behind Browner and Lewis as a slot guy. He has good speed and I think we forced him to play outside last year, which wasn't his ideal position. Hope we can bring him back and focus on other needs in the draft."
Saints,2z8sgv,cajungator3,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:16:19 2015 UTC,He is used to leaving things like that.
Saints,2z8ojx,VegasSaint9,32,Mon Mar 16 15:36:05 2015 UTC,Since when do saints fans care what other people think? I for one love being the underdog. Screw those guys.
Saints,2z8ojx,Lokipokie504,6,Mon Mar 16 15:43:34 2015 UTC,Just saying its a little early. I like it too I feel we play dominant when we are underdogs instead of when we're expected to win games.
Saints,2z8ojx,watchout4mikem,26,Mon Mar 16 15:46:01 2015 UTC,I like the Saints response...
Saints,2z8ojx,Salamanderfs,3,Mon Mar 16 15:53:50 2015 UTC,Saints' social media on FLEEK
Saints,2z8ojx,pottersquash,9,Mon Mar 16 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"I would always rather be counted out than counted on in sports. The difference between victory and defeat is so close, sometimes, surprise is only weapon you truly have."
Saints,2z8ojx,phargle,9,Mon Mar 16 15:46:04 2015 UTC,"We started last season as SB contenders and stepped on our dicks.  I'd rather see the team go in as an underdog and climb the power rankings each week.  That's what we were born to do. You want a team's character? We're not titans. We're titan-slayers. We're back from the ashes. That's what the Saints mean, that's what they stand for.  And analysts are overstating the problems from last season—we were inches and seconds from being an 10-6 team, a blink away from being in the playoffs. You can't count this team out, not in 2015, not in any year."
Saints,2z8ojx,T12ISC,6,Mon Mar 16 20:31:38 2015 UTC,The NFL hates us
Saints,2z8ojx,RockintheShockin,10,Mon Mar 16 15:52:55 2015 UTC,This is an understatement.
Saints,2z8ojx,makeplayz,5,Mon Mar 16 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"I listened to this on my way into work this morning. Its the Dave Damasheck Podcast. Other talking points in that podcast were, What's better Thin Mints or Somoas? So take that for what you will."
Saints,2z8ojx,makeplayz,3,Mon Mar 16 16:17:21 2015 UTC,"If someone said ""The Saints are SB contenders heading into 2015,"" you'd think they were nuts. Why does someone saying the opposite shock you?   We're not gonna win the SB next year, that's very highly unlikely. At this point we're looking to improve. I understand the organization has a ""win now"" mentality because Brees will be 36 when the season starts, but adding a few people isn't gonna change things. We still have almost everyone coming back barring a few LBs and Corey White, a few additions and the upcoming draft. The only way we'd truly be favored, is if our defense meshes well in the offseason and plays No. 1 defense status.   I feel like we have imporved and we will continue to improve. Starting with our offensive mindset. We pass too much. We're too predictable. We've gotten rid of the two targets Brees loves most, Sproles and Graham. Which is a good thing. When we had Sproles and Graham, we were SO predictable. Dump off to Sproles, seam to Jimmy, dump off to Sproles.  I never was mad we got rid of Sproles, I was ecstatic we got rid of Jimmy, I wanted him gone last year if we couldv'e gotten two firsts for him. But, we're about to run the ball. We also ran the ball a lot in 2009. We also won a SB in 2009. Im a Saints fan first and foremost, I dont care if we run the ball 45 times a game and Brees passes 20 times or less and we win. Brees doesn't have to be the spotlight on a winning team, especially when he's about to turn 36. Ask Elway...  This is what I've been dying for for 3 years now, is a Saints team that runs the ball, and runs it well, to make Drew better. He doesn't need 5000 yards, which I know most Saints fans would prefer a 5000 yard season from Brees and a SB win over a 1600 yard Ingram year with a SB win where Brees isn't in MVP consideration. I just want another trophy, I don't care how it's acquired."
Saints,2z8ojx,cfiggis,2,Mon Mar 16 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, I just think its foolish to write us off. I don't think we deserve to be favored to win at all. How many of us expected us to win the Super Bowl after going 8-8 after 2008? Noooo one. Not even us. The ball bounces our way a little more next year, I could very well see us in the Super Bowl, but it goes both ways. I think we've had a lot of bad luck lately and it will change. These moves will pan out sooner or later. I'm optimistic about the future with or without Brees, Payton is going to lock up our future for the better with these draft picks. I hope we can get another with Drew, and I think we're a little overdue for one. I'm excited for us to establish ourselves as the ground and pound defensive Saints with a HoF QB."
Saints,2z8ojx,hrafnass,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, when we got Greg Williams and Jabari Greer, I swore up and down this was our year, and I had never claimed for us to ""have a year"" before that and the only other year I claimed was ""our year"" was 2012 (HA!).  But i get what you're saying completely."
Saints,2z8ojx,Big-Zoo,3,Mon Mar 16 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Please, sleep on us. Forget that we're dangerous. How long did it take them to catch on in 2009? Some people never believed it.  I Believe."
Saints,2z8ojx,Salamanderfs,2,Mon Mar 16 20:42:14 2015 UTC,maybe it's better this way... last year in the offseason we were totally hyped and analysts ranked us as SB-Contenders... and yeah you know what happend

Saints,2z8e63,Losalou52,3,Mon Mar 16 20:37:19 2015 UTC,He is one of the more exciting young players in the league.  Excited to see him grow into his role.  I expect big things in 15' from Cooks.
Saints,2z8e63,Salamanderfs,2,Mon Mar 16 16:55:39 2015 UTC,"It means that Cooks will still have a big role and can still be that surprise playmaker that he was last season when he was healthy and his game was ON.   Cooks/Colston/Saunders can be a very good WR corps as long as Brees is protected and Benjamin Watson and Josh Hill prove themselves to be capable of showing up here and there to make catches. Our receiving corps has declined a bit yes, but I see a lot of potential to turn things around."
Saints,2z8e63,jackmuhswag,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"Don't forget toon, he played well given the amount of snaps he played. Hopefully we draft Jaelen Strong, he looks like he could replace colston when he decides to retire."

Saints,2z6nxu,harveyfjord,4,Mon Mar 16 01:41:21 2015 UTC,I don't expect to see him at 13 unless we're mocking on fanspeak.
Saints,2z6nxu,sart0rial,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"I think Fowler is and will be the best pass rusher in the draft class (Beasley is second in my opinion too), and I don't think Fowler has any chance of falling to 13. Beasley might fall to 13, and I hope he does, but we'll have to see how it plays out."

Saints,2z6nxu,sfzen,4,Mon Mar 16 05:19:01 2015 UTC,Not SJB!  I was looking forward to seeing him develop this year behind Lewis and Browner.  Give him time.
Saints,2z6nxu,sart0rial,5,Mon Mar 16 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"He was a healthy scratch last year. We got Breaux and ""drafted"" Rollins. SJB was expendable at that point IMO, especially for a guy that could somewhat possibly replace Graham."

The first two rounds are exceptional and pretty much perfectly fills what we lack.  Devin Funchess though? Oh dear go, no. Please. We do not need someone like him especially with his stone hands and awful speed. Other than that, very good in my opinion."
Saints,2z6nxu,cfiggis,2,Mon Mar 16 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not extremely high on Funchess either, but it was at the end of the 3rd round and he was our 5th player taken in the draft. All we had to do to get him was give up SJB. Had he been picked at 2.12 or 3.11/3.14, then yeah I could understand frustration. But at where we got him, it was worth the shot to see if he pans out."

Saints,2z58a4,Mastered_Baiting,-6,Sun Mar 15 21:14:27 2015 UTC,Meacham will never be a saint again. Sean cut him midseason for locker room issues and lack of caring. U can make the argument that he was the first to go. Bringing him back would be a complete contradiction of what Sean and Mickey are trying to do. Also he lost that track speed and ability to catch.

Saints,2z58a4,VegasSaint9,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:29:09 2015 UTC,Sad to say but he'd likely be an upgrade over Colston. Only problem id have with him is he seems to be injury prone and streaky.

If you read his book, Drew was in such pain from the shoulder that he couldn't lift his right arm when he was announced. And looking at the picture, he's holding the jersey with his left hand while his right is just sort of dangling."

Saints,2z2hcf,smilefortony,4,Sun Mar 15 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"Well, he isn't that terribly in coverage. He's usually right there. He just has a complete inability to find the ball while its in the air. I suppose that coach able. Either way, he had time to fix that with us. Sometimes a change of scenery is the kick in the butt someone needs. That doesn't mean they would've progressed the same if they would've stayed. And Jenkins was the same in philly as he was with us; make a big play, give up a big play.

Saints,2z16cv,Yeti100,5,Sat Mar 14 19:29:40 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm happy to have him as a player. Kinda bummed that he's taken out of somewhere he was settled and happy though.

Saints,2z16cv,MOONGOONER,2,Sun Mar 15 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"People seem to think trading Jimmy for him was like trading gold for gravel, but the truth is we've had a hole at center for a while and it's finally filled. We'll miss Jimmy's raw talent plus his offensive presence and ability to draw double/triple coverage almost every play.

I think you're right that, given the appropriate amount of attention, he could fill Graham's role in those outside TE formations.   I've maintained my pretty high opinion of him since last offseason. So I'm kind of rooting for him to get a shot at this point."
Saints,2z1za7,Atheismo15,3,Sat Mar 14 22:05:17 2015 UTC,Hands are an issue but if he works on that he'd be good for jump balls and red zone.
Saints,2z1za7,IAteTheFridge,5,Sat Mar 14 23:09:16 2015 UTC,At this point I'm fine not knowing what Payloo have in mind for Coleman and indeed the rest of the receiving core. Unfortunately the same quality that enables them to be unpredictable to opposing teams also prevents us loyal fans from having much of a clue as to what they have in mind most of the time. Many guys and gals on here do a great job predicting WR and RB usage stats but it is still a hard code to break.
Saints,2z1za7,jowenw,5,Sat Mar 14 23:12:51 2015 UTC,No. We need to draft a receiver.  The only one that can be counted on at this point is Cooks.
Saints,2z1za7,Duff_Beer,2,Sun Mar 15 00:02:50 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, an impact receiver to go along with Cooks, Colston, and Toon will go a long way. It will be interesting to see though if Coleman can be our WR5, he always seem to have a good camp competition for that last spot and I'm hoping Coleman can produce when he gets his chances."
Saints,2z1za7,aimerj,1 point,Sun Mar 15 01:24:06 2015 UTC,"I was commenting the other day on/r/nfl  how much I want him to get more comfortable in the offense.  Graham: 6'7, 265, 4.6 40 time.  Coleman: 6'6, 225, 4.6 40 time.  He could beef up and be a very comparable matchup nightmare.  I realize his hands need work, but it's not like Graham caught everything thrown his way anyway."

Saints,2z2art,upvotegordy,3,Sat Mar 14 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"As a fan of both bama and the saints, i would love for that to happen, but it's just not gonna happen unless we trade up. And we're not gonna trade up because we have 8+ untested receivers on the roster as is to back up cooks."
Saints,2z2art,flordeliest,4,Sun Mar 15 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"As far as the draft goes, we are probably going to use the late round picks on WR and OL depth, and use the early picks, 75 and under, on defense. Our drafting record for finding late round OLs and WRs is pretty good so I don't mind this strategy. Plus we have a lot of young ??? at those positions who ma turn out to be starters.  White > Cooper."
Saints,2z2art,flordeliest,3,Sat Mar 14 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed,  we may very well take that route,  but we also take the best player we can sometimes and I think Cooper is a game changer."

Saints,2z2art,Darryl_Strawberry,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:45:09 2015 UTC,"You think white is better than cooper? I understand he had an amazing combine, but white doesn't play as fast as he ran at TE combine, and cooper is a proven stud. I'd rather cooper, especially for our offense. He's a precise route runner with great hands and pretty good speed. Drew would light it up with him. Route running is absolutely essential when it comes to a timing/distributing qb like Drew, and cooper is the best route runner in this draft."
Saints,2z2art,PhoSho86,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Not to mention his attitude. Cooper is quiet, an incredibly hard worker, a champion, and is on the record saying he does not care for Bourbon Street. The guy just wants to ball.   I feel like with the overhaul in the attitude department that we're undergoing this offseason, Coop would fit in perfectly. Drew would freaking love this guy."

Saints,2z2art,quantumhed,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:52:19 2015 UTC,"We don't need a WR that early in the draft. We can pick receivers up in the later rounds because DB9 makes it work. When you have a quarterback as good as ours, you don't need stud receivers to use as a crutch. I liken it to the Patriots -- sans Gronkowski, no receiver is particularly a ""stud"" but they win because Tom Brady puts it on the money, time after time.  Also, we have much bigger things to worry about in this draft, particularly a line on both sides of the ball and a more well-rounded, less-banged-up secondary."
Saints,2z2art,lordbyronxiv,1 point,Sun Mar 15 21:05:52 2015 UTC,"We'd have to trade up to get him, and I don't see us doing that (or want us to). I think our top picks (first 2 rounds, part of round 3) are going to players that can contribute immediately on defense at a position of best availability. I could see us picking up someone on offense via one of our 3rd round picks. Maybe a new TE like we got Jimmy Graham in the 3rd. Then best availability overall for rounds 5-7.  The only way I see us taking an offensive player in the first is possibly someone for the O-line if he grades significantly higher than any of the defense in positions of need."
Saints,2z2art,BootsBean,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:48:12 2015 UTC,That would be a huge mistake. We've offloaded so much receiving talent for a reason. We need an O-Lineman and several defenders.

Saints,2z2art,BootsBean,6,Sun Mar 15 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"I've watched a ton of him.  I think he's absolutely insane and has the potential to blossom into a top 10 WR in the next 2-3 years.  He was the best WR in the country this year and 2nd place was a whole tier below him.  If he's at 13, I hope we grab him.  If not, I hope we use our early pics for defense.  We really need a WR from this draft though."
Saints,2z2art,Darryl_Strawberry,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the 2nd WR being a whole tier below him, but there is no denying that he is one of the most technically refined WRs to come out as a prospect in quite some time. I think this will allow him to have am immediate impact."

So while the site says we are ~4.2 million over the cap, we are currently under the cap.  We have more moves and deals to make before we can sign our draft picks as we aren't allowed over the the cap at any point in time or we face a $5 million fine, loss of draft picks and canceled contracts.

Saints,2z141t,ThickWaffles,9,Sat Mar 14 16:25:19 2015 UTC,Ellerbe isn't a horrible player he's just not all that great either. He had a couple nice games in 2012 and stepped up in the playoffs that year but aside from that he's always been just a guy.  He's the kind of starter where you're not in a rush to replace him but you're always open to the possibility of doing so if one comes along.  The Dolphins screwed up by being him like he was about to become an elite player but assuming his cap number is brought down to a more reasonable level he should be a solid option for the Saints while they fill other needs.
Saints,2z141t,PomfAndCircvmstance,9,Sat Mar 14 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"""Just a guy"" is better than our current lb corps so ill take it."

Saints,2z141t,TheAwes0meFish,5,Sat Mar 14 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"I like that he's a LB, and with releasing Lofton we need those players. So I'm optimistic. He's not a superstar, though. But they can't all be."
Saints,2z141t,cfiggis,5,Sat Mar 14 16:42:42 2015 UTC,I know he did well in Baltimores 3-4 and not the greatest in Miami's 4-3. So im expecting the 3-4 to be a breath of fresh air and he will be a serviceable player.

Saints,2z141t,dean815,2,Sat Mar 14 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"i dont really like Ellerbe as a player.. he was decent in Baltimore behind Ray Lewis, so it should be interesting how Rob Ryan uses him."

Saints,2z141t,platypuspracticus,2,Sat Mar 14 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no I really like the move. Depending on final terms of restructure we may have gotten a steal. Guy learned LB under Ray Lewis, was good in Miami. His injury  doesn't appear to be the type of systemic  chornic thing and he seems excited as fuck. A true 3-4 MLB who knows how to play that position. And given he was to be cut and coming off IR I am extremely  hopeful we will get him for either favorable short term amounts or  a long term guy who can be a fixture. Vilma was a loud mouth ra ra guy, Lofton wasn't. Vaccaro, Galette, Byrd, Browner are all talkers. I don't  know about this guy but I  would be shocked if the understudy  to Ray Lewis was a silent mute. Ryan's  like to be brash and nasty, we are building a D in that image."

Saints,2z1yfj,bobbyblack,7,Sat Mar 14 20:44:57 2015 UTC,Corey White just because he's a good tackler
Saints,2z1yfj,jackmuhswag,4,Sat Mar 14 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"White easy. Both are less than desirable, and have a habit of taking their eyes of the WR. White's main problems was knowing when to turn his head and locating the ball, he either doesn't at all or does just in time to get snagged on. He is usually in position to make a play on the ball, but he never really does actually make a play. Best case scenario the ball pops out when he tackles them.  Robinson on the other hand bit on every curl, stutter step, hook, fake, and every other move on the book when in man. He just never got better with experience, he just used his athleticism to make up for his constant mistakes. The worst part is he has all the traits of great corner.  Also White is a really good tackler for cornerbacks standards, I don't think I have ever seen Robinson make a solo open field tackle and White is 24 and could still improve, Robinson is 28 and I personally have given up on him.  I'd be fine with re-signing White for league minimum, I don't want Robinson.   Best case is for Robinson to go to a primary zone defense like the Bucs, he might actually do well there. They won't ask for man coverage. He is athletic enough to cover a lot of ground, and he can stare at the QB all he wants."
Saints,2z1yfj,flordeliest,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:14:08 2015 UTC,That was well said.
Saints,2z1yfj,bobbyblack,3,Sun Mar 15 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Neither are good players, but I would choose Corey White only because he is 24 and can potentially improve while PRob is 28 and doesn't have a lot of years left IMO."

Saints,2z0ib9,krazy9000,10,Sat Mar 14 14:35:51 2015 UTC,One mistake is acting like trading Stills is the same as trading a 5th rounder.  Stills obviously outperformed his draft position and has proven to be a better player than anything anyone will likely get in the 5th round.  The Dolphins needed cap relief and wanted to rid themselves of Ellerbe's contract anyway they could.  Ended up working out for both sides because of the fact that Ellerbe was willing to restructure
Saints,2z0ib9,yrogreg,10,Sat Mar 14 16:38:34 2015 UTC,Look at their contracts to see why.
Saints,2z0ib9,Saints2Death,2,Sat Mar 14 13:45:28 2015 UTC,I think Stills is going to have himself a good career and I always liked him a lot as a receiver and his attitude in the field. If his attitude off the field is a problem I suppose it needed to be addressed but I'll miss having the kid in New Orleans.
Saints,2z0ib9,dean815,2,Sat Mar 14 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Great trade for us, although I think Stills kept us in a lot of games last year (even ones we lost, but still gave us a chance.)"
Saints,2z0ib9,aimerj,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:20:51 2015 UTC,If Stills  was truly turning the page to becoming  a Diva Receiver  we made out like bandits.
Saints,2z0ib9,pottersquash,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:43:59 2015 UTC,Stills is much cheaper to have on the roster and he's much younger than Marshall or Wallace
Saints,2z0ib9,neovenator250,1 point,Sat Mar 14 18:24:45 2015 UTC,"Being young and on the uptick is a huge plus as well. Stills is more likely to be a long term installment into the WR group, whereas Marshall and Wallace might not be. In fact it sounds like Wallace might just be a 1 year rental for the Vikings for now.  Marshall and Wallace are certainly quality veterans but they've both been pegged as having diva-like attitudes in some capacity, and it seems clear that since the Bears traded Marshall away that he was likely a big part of locker room 'issues' reported over the season.  Being a big name might mean something to fans and fantasy football (rather, newer FF participants are often drawn to bigger names and tend to overvalue them), but it most often means shit to the teams."
Saints,2z0ib9,KoalaExpress,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:53:51 2015 UTC,I think everyone here already has it covered with the whole contracts thing... The saints didn't magically just rip off the Dolphins by trading a worse receiver for a better pick. The Bears and the Dolphins took much less just to get a contract off the books. And with the Stills trade I would bet the Dolphins were willing to give the third because of the Saints willingness to take on Ellerbe when they were originally planning to cut him and take on his dead money. It was all about the money in each of those trades.

Saints,2z2aar,ImShadier,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"We have quite a few young (but mostly unproven) talents at wideout on our roster now:  Seantavius Jones, Jalen Saunders, Brandon Coleman, and obviously Cooks.  I also think Toon has been gradually improving and can compete.  We're in decent shape, especially when you throw in a late rookie/UDFA or two."

Saints,2z12yq,LegionPeep,7,Sat Mar 14 16:15:59 2015 UTC,I want linebackers! If we had a good LB corps it would help us tremendously.
Saints,2z12yq,VegasSaint9,3,Sat Mar 14 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"Draft needs to me are:  Guard  Edge rushing OLB  ILB  Cornerback  Wide Receiver  Tight End  Personally, I'd love to snag any of Brandon Scherff, La'el Collins, Shane Ray, DeVante Parker, or Vic Beasley with #13"
Saints,2z12yq,neovenator250,2,Sat Mar 14 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"OG should  be a concern if we are wanting to go to a run heavy offense, so we should draft one no later than the 4th.  I think were good with josh hill and watson at TE , but it would make sense to grab on in the later rounds.  But we should defiantly grab a pass rusher high, along with Ilb and corner . Even though we brought in Ellerbe, and Browner, It'd be nice to have some quality depth there."
Saints,2z12yq,jackmuhswag,2,Sat Mar 14 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"We are probably going to use the late round picks on WR and OL depth, and use the early picks, 75 and under, on defense. Our drafting record for finding OLs and WRs is pretty good so I don't mind this strategy, and we really need to focus on that D."
Saints,2z12yq,flordeliest,2,Sat Mar 14 20:34:38 2015 UTC,"NT is our biggest hole, regardless what anyone thinks, Danny Shelton should be our #1 target, let's hope he falls (Extreme pass rush need, coupled with two elite qb prospects) he should. Then ILB, Thompson or Kendricks  at the end of the first. Then straight up BPA"
Saints,2z12yq,aimerj,2,Sun Mar 15 03:42:38 2015 UTC,"I hope we take OG in the 1st or 2nd. We saw what happened last season when we didn't replace our starting C, so we can't just leave the RG spot un-addressed.  We have a lot of holes to fill."
Saints,2z12yq,sfzen,3,Sat Mar 14 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"Don't you think lelito will be the default starting G for now, unless we draft some stud who beats him out?"
Saints,2z12yq,brokenearth02,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. But he wasn't great starting at Center, so I don't want to hand him the starting job at RG. So I'd rather draft someone to compete with him."
Saints,2z12yq,sfzen,4,Sat Mar 14 22:38:46 2015 UTC,"Lelito played Guard in college, and was drafted to play guard. He just happened to end up being the backup center."
Saints,2z12yq,brokenearth02,-1,Sat Mar 14 22:46:09 2015 UTC,Last season we had the #1 offense.
Saints,2z12yq,flordeliest,3,Sat Mar 14 20:24:59 2015 UTC,But Brees threw a lot of interceptions because he barely ever had time in the pocket. We lost a lot of close games by turning the ball over in the 4th quarter.
Saints,2z12yq,sfzen,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:37:30 2015 UTC,"We lost more games off of missed field goals, and I blame the defense way more than Brees for those loses. Only the second Falcons and Panthers game was the line a problem."
Saints,2z12yq,flordeliest,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"We will trade a first and a third to move up to take the WR we really want. We might not do this depending on how the first 6 picks go. We are sitting at a position where one of the WRs might fall to use and one might not.   SEA's pick will be used on defense, best available.  We will draft a guard in the 2nd-3rd range. We have a history of getting steals on the o line late in the draft, so I doubt we draft OL in the first.   Defense the rest of the way."
Saints,2z12yq,ThePuckeringBrown,1 point,Sat Mar 14 20:27:46 2015 UTC,"I think we'll get a wide receiver in the 3rd, but I bet at least 2 of our first 3 picks will be o line and d line.

Saints,2z12yq,haledann,3,Sat Mar 14 16:50:50 2015 UTC,Devantee Parker will be there but I would be more intrigued by Dorial Green Beckham or Breshad Perriman (sp?). Both may fall to the end of round 1 or beginning of round two and arguably have a higher ceiling than White.
Saints,2z12yq,cloud9formations,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"I would enjoy DGB. Mainly because we're from the same city. Springfield, Mo represent."
Saints,2z12yq,hopefulhusband,3,Sat Mar 14 18:29:34 2015 UTC,unless we trade up I don't see him falling to us.
Saints,2z12yq,Charizard_Targaryen,0,Sat Mar 14 16:51:51 2015 UTC,I'd love Scheriff with our first and Dorial Green Beckham with our other first. I really think we need a WR with one of our first 2. We could probably get a guard in the second of Scheriff isn't available.
Saints,2yzorc,bootscallahan,9,Sat Mar 14 04:44:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I love about this team. 7-9 is just not good enough and we are making moves to improve it. You don't see the other teams in our division making big moves like this. Whether it will pan out, we have yet to see."
Saints,2yzorc,SteakWay,19,Sat Mar 14 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"I do like that 7-9 is treated as ""rock bottom."""
Saints,2yzorc,Goingawol,7,Sat Mar 14 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"For the talent and the coaching I would have thought 7-9 was an utter disaster, and it was. This was a team with too much promise that didn't follow through."
Saints,2yzorc,IAteTheFridge,7,Sat Mar 14 08:21:08 2015 UTC,We were Super Bowl favorites going into the season so it was definitely a disaster of a season. Same record as the 2012 debacle despite the better talent on both sides of the ball.
Saints,2yzorc,aimerj,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:06:35 2015 UTC,"I still feel like our drafting will be dumb, like solidified CB but we draft Trae Waynes or Kevin White or Amari Drops to us and we draft them, while our top needs our on the board still. I like those moves to a degree, but not when we are preaching revamping defense and draft those guys. 2nd round we'll draft a guard.3rds will finally be NT and ILB.5th a qb, 6-7 OLBs. I just have no faith in our ability to draft right now."
Saints,2yzorc,Megawatts19,6,Sat Mar 14 06:55:16 2015 UTC,"If Kevin White or Amari drop to us, we better fuckin draft them!!"
Saints,2yzorc,aimerj,2,Sat Mar 14 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's just totally hypocritical to get rid of Jimmy this year because he's a luxury, and Brees can make more when given less, but then they don't draft top end defensive NEED  talent, like I said I like it to a degree, but still would piss me off."
Saints,2yzorc,serenity_suppository,1 point,Sat Mar 14 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"Seriously, can't pass that up"
Saints,2yzorc,pottersquash,1 point,Sat Mar 14 11:05:32 2015 UTC,If Amari drops out of Top 5 I think  you go get him. Frankly if he id there when Falcons pick wouldn't be surprised  if one of the most talked about trades in history is made.
Saints,2yzorc,Jaul18,7,Sat Mar 14 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"Why are you even talking as if that's how the draft is going to go? You have literally no idea how the draft will end up turning out.  It's fine to take a guess/do a mock draft as a representation of how the draft MIGHT end up, but it's so unbelievably hilarious to me when fans actually get mad or complain about how THEY think our draft is going to go when literally the only people on planet earth that have any leverage/decision-making over this sort of thing are the respective GM's and coaches/coordinators of each team (And in some occasions the owners).  It's completely different AND justified to say ""I hope we don't target X or Z in the draft"" than it is to say ""I feel our drafting will be dumb WHEN WE draft X, Y, or Z."""
Saints,2yzorc,aimerj,-2,Sat Mar 14 07:28:39 2015 UTC,"How is it not fine? The article talks about how we are shaking things up and I'm giving examples, given our poor drafting recently, how we are making these moves and we will still fuck it all up on draft day. If anything my hypothetical is a fans honest distrust in our FO to do the right thing. And also, I have no idea, yes, but neither do you. And trust me I'm the last person who would want what I posted to happen, but what if everything I said did come true. Then what, if I'm completely right, your going to come apologize and bring me cookies, Idc about your idiotic reasoning on why I shouldn't post what I may think will happen. Don't agree, say I don't think we will, SP is a genius and we will draft needs, not a 5 minute long paragraph on why we should only be posting mock drafts."
Saints,2yzorc,KingManlet,5,Sat Mar 14 13:13:16 2015 UTC,Our drafting has been decent the last few years. Every team misses. This year it will swing either way after vaccarros third year and when we see what sjb has.
Saints,2yzorc,aimerj,-1,Sat Mar 14 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that we have to develop them before we can rly judge but honestly I don't see many great picks. 2014 Sunseri & Cooks (although I think given the chance and targets Stills could have just been our possession/deep threat guy and we could have found a shifty RB for our ""sproles replacement"". I love the 2013 class. 2012 we were screwed yeah, Toon has been okay at best. 2011 first rounders, but after that nothing.2010 our 3rd rounder Jimmy Graham, but no one else. Since we won the SB only have one good draft class, being 2013, others decent or okay."

Saints,2yzorc,aimerj,1 point,Sat Mar 14 11:09:50 2015 UTC,"Well now that we got rid of them all maybe, but I still think NT is a bigger hole than ILB, getting a guy like Haloti Ngata in a 3-4 would do wonders for run defense, coverage, second level tackling, you don't usually draft coverage linebackers, they develop into being better at coverage."

Saints,2yz6lc,fireinthesky7,10,Sat Mar 14 03:37:53 2015 UTC,I don't know shit about schemes but I would assume since Keenan and Browner can play man it will allow Vacarro to roam free which was the role he loved and played well during his first season.
Saints,2yz6lc,IHaveNoFiya,5,Sat Mar 14 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"I really hope so. He was incredible in zone coverage his rookie year, and then we abandoned that entire scheme in 2014 and he fell on his face."

Saints,2yxcmo,Paythesnucka,3,Fri Mar 13 21:48:17 2015 UTC,Fair enough but one of them was a FA acquisition 14 m/4 years the other was the Second Overall draft pick.
Saints,2yxcmo,donvito7335,4,Fri Mar 13 23:06:12 2015 UTC,Crowded backfield again. I kind of hoped they would push Ingram to 20 carries a game. Doesn't seem like that now unless they plan on only using him and Spiller
Saints,2yxcmo,brandonie187,10,Fri Mar 13 17:00:22 2015 UTC,Ingram should still get the bulk of carries.  Spiller has shown for a few years that he is explosive but can't be a workhorse.

I really think Payton's obsession with rb depth stems to the beast quake year.  Our backfield was running on fumes and I don't think he ever wants that to happen again"
Saints,2yxcmo,brokenearth02,2,Sun Mar 15 03:25:42 2015 UTC,Great Move!!! Spiller is a great in special teams too!! Now we can keep Cooks out of punt return. He looks so uncomfortable doing it.

For the right money, and in the right role he'd be a good possession receiver to balance the speed of Cooks and the other parts of the offense. Another thing to consider: he's a good run blocker.   Decent hands, not much speed, possession guy/ role player with good run blocking skills? Sounds like a good player for your receiver rotation. Not an alpha male type out there, but a good tool for the tool box."

We can prolly find a few decent receivers in the 3rd/5th that Brees will make look like 1st round talent.

Saints,2yxk36,pottersquash,0,Fri Mar 13 20:56:59 2015 UTC,"Cowboys, heck yeah! I feel like Payton and Loomis were watching what Romo was able to do last season, then looked at how we shit the bed, and realized what needed to be done.   They probably also looked at Brady. Remember when it was all about Brady not having any good targets? Turns out that doesn't matter if you're one of the best ever and your O-line keeps you alive. Who knew?"
Saints,2yxk36,phargle,-2,Fri Mar 13 21:46:14 2015 UTC,Exec of year... Cowboys have been a laughing stock for 3 years for not making the playoffs... If the saints make the playoffs next year. The 31 other teams would laugh at the notion of Loomis for ex of the year...
Saints,2yxk36,megapunt,2,Fri Mar 13 22:44:23 2015 UTC,If this many moves pan out? We shall see.
Saints,2yxk36,pottersquash,-1,Fri Mar 13 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, I get it if everyone out performs their contract then yes. So would every gm."
Saints,2yxk36,megapunt,3,Fri Mar 13 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"People say this every single year, honestly at this point we've learned to accept that he's not playing kick the can, it's a long term deal for a long term plan.  It's naive to think that we know more about the team's future than him, which is why ""In Loomis We Trust"" is a thing.  Graham didn't fit into the new Saints as well as you suggest.  He was a superstar, and I don't think he was soft as many overrationalizing fans may try to have you believe, but he doesn't block and the Saints are trying to be run first.  Look at who they got in the Graham deal.  Unger, a bonafide superstar in the run game, and another first rounder.  5 of the first 80 picks belong to New Orleans.  Ingram was the first priority in free agency, and signing Spiller only serves to reinforce the idea.  He's a scat guy, the Sean Payton offense doesn't run without them.  They're building the team differently than they have in the past.  That isn't burning it all down.  It's an important distinction.  You can come over and ask us what the Saints are doing in the offseason, but we don't know the whole picture and only have inkling of what exactly we're trying to do.  Just don't come here expecting confirmation bias, because we've seen this team go several different directions."
Saints,2yxk36,SkivK,-2,Fri Mar 13 20:52:42 2015 UTC,"25 lines describing why he's great, having a vision, and getting rid of players that don't fit.  Jimmy fit.  In fact with out Jimmy your offense didn't fit.  I came over to see wtf was happening in nola to this...?  That's great you got browner, but again just another average starter being paid high end dollar.  How does that help you. Spiller and browner bring in more cap problems down the road.  Why is this good.  Please can another saint fan explain. Why Loomis should be praised for signing more bad contracts when your team is drowning in bad contracts.   Also op Loomis moved the cap hit to next year like every year with saints. Youre more screwed next year. Even more screwed the year after and so on"
Saints,2yxk36,megapunt,8,Fri Mar 13 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"Actually our cap situation in the next couple years is much better than it was originally. You're a Bears fan though, so I can understand why you'd be so pessimistic."
Saints,2yxk36,megapunt,-3,Fri Mar 13 20:53:33 2015 UTC,No it is not...
Saints,2yxk36,theDOC7OR,2,Fri Mar 13 22:56:05 2015 UTC,"You're an idiot, we will be 20-30mil UNDER next year unless there are more signings."
Saints,2yxk36,MOONGOONER,2,Sat Mar 14 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"See the thing is, we looked screwed going into this offseason, and somehow we've already made huge strides towards fixing our major problems from last year without having used our bazillion draft picks yet. If we're going to be screwed like this next year... then I'll probably end up looking forward to it.  If you don't see why the Jimmy trade made sense, you should check out one of the bunch of other posts about it. It's still a shocker, and it's definitely a high-risk move, but what didn't fit about our offense more than anything was a weak offensive line. Meanwhile Jimmy went entire games without being targeted this last season."
Saints,2yxk36,absorbing_downvotes,-3,Fri Mar 13 20:46:55 2015 UTC,"Underrated?  Are you kidding me?  This sub worships the ground Loomis walks on.  He is literally called a genius in every post he is mentioned in.  A ""Cap God"" doesn't put his team in a position where they are $7 mil over the cap space.  What 1-2 running punch are you talking about?  We were 13th last year in running with Ingram who for once avoided injuries, and Spiller only ran for 300 yards, so exactly how much pressure do you think they've really taken off of Drew Brees?  This is an offensive team with no offensive power right now.  But ALL HAIL LOOMIS, IN LOOMIS WE TRUST, 6- 10 HERE WE COME"
Saints,2yywv2,volstedgridban,21,Sat Mar 14 00:14:33 2015 UTC,Rob can't make the players tackle. They decided to not do that on their own last year.
Saints,2yywv2,Diesel46,9,Sat Mar 14 00:20:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've been saying Rob wasn't the problem. More than that, a coach needs long term stability to fix mid season problems. Rob can't expect to get anything out of players if they feel he's outta here anyway. I think Payton sent a strong message. If u don't perform or take this serious. Its your job on the line, not Robs, not Sean's, and not Drew's lol... He sorta sent this message when he benched everyone end of the yr who wasn't playing hard. I'm hoping gallete got the message . becuz he's next if he doesn't get his on field and off the field act together."
Saints,2yywv2,mes8007,4,Sat Mar 14 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"You said it perfectly, everyone outside of our fan base is saying we are panicking with all of these trades. I see it as our management's way of saying there's no way we are letting that kind of attitude/effort slide any longer."
Saints,2yywv2,jfox210,7,Sat Mar 14 01:02:42 2015 UTC,Yea guys literally didn't care. Were losing games. And jimmy Graham is posting pics on Twitter flying planes in middle of a losing streak. Got guys like gallete this defense more successful and better off without guys like will smith and Vilma. And so on. I'm so glad Bradin Cooks is a very high character guy. Rest of these clowns who wasn't here for the Superbowl and think they can just tear Down what Sean has built need to go.
Saints,2yywv2,mes8007,2,Sat Mar 14 01:29:42 2015 UTC,"I am sooo ready for a full season of Cooks, can't wait for his sophomore season! We'll see after the draft, but I'm feeling pretty positive about our chances of having a complete turnaround next season. April 30th can't come soon enough"
Saints,2yywv2,jfox210,3,Sat Mar 14 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yea Jimmy was highest paid player on team outside of drew and showed no leadership. Never once have I seen or heard stories of him trying to accept his role as a multi year vet now and set a tone. Jimmy was in training camp and preseason dunking the ball on the goal post still and getting preseason flags. And what kind of message does that send to the other guys. The young guys or guys trying to get paid like him.. Just sets the wrong tone entirely. Its cute and fun when ur young acting like that. But when u sign a franchise contract like the one his signed. Accountability and a sense of ownership is supposed to come with that. I never saw that from him on the field. Nor did I read stories from reporters about him exhibiting that. Those guys in Seattle are pretty tough and don't BS around. Maybe he'll learn to be a leader there. Becuz 5 yrs under Drew and guys like Vilma, and its like he learned nothing."
Saints,2yywv2,mes8007,2,Sat Mar 14 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, JG was one of my favorite players on the team and initially I was pissed about the trade. After some time to think about it, I started to see the reasoning behind the deal though. We need leaders on this team. Browner, Unger, and a full season of Byrd should bring more leadership."
Saints,2yywv2,jfox210,2,Sat Mar 14 02:28:29 2015 UTC,I don't think Ryan was ever at risk
Saints,2yywv2,saints_fan504,2,Sat Mar 14 00:45:49 2015 UTC,Which players are/were Rob's players?
Saints,2yywv2,sophandros,2,Sat Mar 14 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"I think anyone would be foolish to see Ryan as the problem after last season. We lost all our leaders and replaced them with inexperienced players or just plain bad players. Lost Greer, Harper, Jenkins, Byrd and our pass rush was shit. Tackling was definitely a big issue as well."
Saints,2yywv2,IHaveNoFiya,2,Sat Mar 14 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's kind of a cool dynamic that Rob is the ""good cop"" coach whereas Loomis is the ruthlessly pragmatic enforcer."

Saints,2yxtf8,cfiggis,8,Fri Mar 13 19:27:39 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub!  I agree that these moves are being done for a variety of reasons. Not only are we trying to bring up our D by getting rid of some surplus O, not only are we generating extra picks, not only are we shedding cap, but we are also trying to redefine our locker room attitude and culture. That's something that I don't think a lot of reporters are taking into account when grading our trades and moves. To really catalyze change, you've got to achieve critical mass. An influx of new people with good attitudes, combined with the departure of some others has a real chance at achieving that change. I really hope it works out for us!"
Saints,2yxtf8,Briguy_fieri,3,Fri Mar 13 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, you just cant fall into the trap of grading trades at this point. These same experts had us in the Super Bowl or NFC championship last year. Clearly something was wrong in that locker room and the guys who have the best read on it are making changes. In the long run I love the fact that when the Saints underachieve, the organization doesn't just hope things change. They are making the changes and making tough decisions."
Saints,2yxtf8,apecool,3,Fri Mar 13 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the sub  I'll say this about the lockerroom attitude. We've heard rumors but we don't actually know what happened. We can only speculate. There was something severely wrong with our team last year. If it was attitude based get rid of the problems. If they partied nights before games, find the resolution. If the players aren't believing in coaches we need to fix that. But we struck 0 fear in anyone last year. Whether it was no heart or other behind the scene issues. But it needed to be addressed."

Saints,2yxcr0,DeepWelshVoice,47,Fri Mar 13 16:51:12 2015 UTC,We traded our 3rd best WR for a starting LB and a 3rd round pick. I will gladly take that.
Saints,2yxcr0,Twistify804,16,Fri Mar 13 16:54:48 2015 UTC,Me too. I'm not convinced Stills will be that great of a receiver outside of our offense with Brees.
Saints,2yxcr0,Cpt_Sum_Ting_Wong,14,Fri Mar 13 17:02:56 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, Ellerbe SUCKED in Miami (from a Dolphin fan) and he was injured for the entire 2014 season. Every Dolphins fan wanted him cut for nothing, so we are all doing the jig for getting a young fast WR in return for him and a 3rd."
Saints,2yxcr0,Skape7,5,Fri Mar 13 17:38:02 2015 UTC,GOD DAMN IT WHY ARE WE TRADING EVERYBODY FOR INJURY PRONE PLAYERS
Saints,2yxcr0,docfelt,2,Fri Mar 13 19:50:37 2015 UTC,Because he went from an undrafted free agent to getting decent playing time and occasionally starting for the Ravens. He also helped the Ravens beat the Pats and to win the Super Bowl and was third on the team (Dolphins) in tackles in 2013. Next highest were 107 and 118. So he has shown solid production and has only had one major injury in college and the pros (iirc)

Saints,2yxcr0,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"Supposedly Stills had a habit of drinking before practices and possibly home games, and I think Brees got fed up with Stills's trend of just plain giving up on plays from the moment the ball was snapped."

Saints,2yxcr0,asmodeus01,2,Fri Mar 13 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"He can be renegotiated - and it would make sense for him to do so. Right now he can be cut from the Saints with zero cap hit, so there's no insurance for him that he'll be on the roster. Taking a new deal with guaranteed money on it will mean the team has to think a little harder if they want to get rid of him."

Saints,2yxcr0,stillcasey,6,Fri Mar 13 18:50:34 2015 UTC,I feel the same way. Mostly I'm just surprised that stills had that much market value. But it looks like the dolphins wanted to unload ellerbe anyways so maybe it was more of a convenience thing.
Saints,2yxcr0,Jsizzles93,3,Fri Mar 13 17:07:09 2015 UTC,So much for Saints slashing salaries. Ellerbe has 3 years and $20.95 million left on his deal. Stills has 2 years and $1.26 million on his.
Saints,2yxcr0,pouwi,2,Fri Mar 13 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm a little confused here. Unless he's going to take a pay cut, why wouldn't we just hang with Lofton?"
Saints,2yxcr0,GreenVisorOfJustice,5,Fri Mar 13 17:44:50 2015 UTC,He will take a cap friendly paycut or he will simply be cut.  Since the Saints are on the hook for none of the guaranteed they can cut him and pay him $0.   So worse case we got a 3rd round pick. Best case he takes a massive paycut on a team friendly contract and we get a 3rd and much needed linebacker.
Saints,2yxcr0,Bunnyhat,2,Fri Mar 13 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"Plus, this means one of the depth LBs can be cut which will save a minute bit of cap as well."
Saints,2yxcr0,Naly_D,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"None of Ellerbe's remaining contract is guaranteed. We'll either restructure him, or just cut him if he tries to hold out for a boatload."
Saints,2yxcr0,fireinthesky7,10,Sat Mar 14 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"From a Ravens fan's perspective hoping Stills would be traded to the Ravens, I think the Dolphins way overpaid. Stills is a great WR, but he isn't worth a LB and a 3rd round pick. Good job on that trade"
Saints,2yxcr0,nickgriffith,4,Fri Mar 13 17:01:56 2015 UTC,If we could have cut ellerbe this year for nothing we would have. Losing ellerbe was a plus for miami.
Saints,2yxcr0,Badmoodsbear,0,Fri Mar 13 17:40:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, but losing your third round pick for him is a little pricy by my standards"
Saints,2yxcr0,nickgriffith,5,Fri Mar 13 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how Stills performs over the next couple of years. From Miami's perspective, this was essentially a third rounder for Stills. It's stupid to say whether one side or the other won the trade before either player has played a snap for their teams. There's positives and negatives for both. Dolphins really did need another WR after releasing Gibson and Hartline."
Saints,2yxcr0,waffuls1,12,Fri Mar 13 18:05:25 2015 UTC,As a Ravens fan I strongly disagree. Ellerbe is a horrible LB on an even more horrible contract. He can never stay healthy either. The fact the Fins could get him off their books in return for anything of value is a huge win for them.
Saints,2yxcr0,hattmarrington,11,Fri Mar 13 17:11:42 2015 UTC,I agree with this much more as a Dolphins fan watching him play the past two years. We were just going to cut him. He was pretty much good for 5 missed tackles a game and was eating up too much of our cap space.
Saints,2yxcr0,concussed_cowboy,2,Fri Mar 13 17:28:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying Ellerbe is a great LB, but a 3rd rounder for a 3rd string WR is horrible."
Saints,2yxcr0,nickgriffith,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:50:28 2015 UTC,Not at all. Stills is a proven commodity and is better than a 3rd stringer in most offenses. Over 900 yards last year. You'd be very lucky to duplicate that kind of production with a draft pick -- a lot don't pan out.
Saints,2yxcr0,hattmarrington,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:55:40 2015 UTC,"There's been more than few ""proven"" WR's that have left the Saints and gone on to do nothing."
Saints,2yxcr0,Bunnyhat,0,Fri Mar 13 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, this is exactly correct. Ellerbe was no where near productive for his salary, and his injuries. The Dolphins hosed the Saints on this."
Saints,2yxcr0,raxel82,12,Fri Mar 13 17:29:27 2015 UTC,"""Hosed the Saints""? What a complete exaggeration. Ellerbe is okay.. the contract sucks but it's still a mediocre LB but a 3rd for Stills is fantastic. Time and again Brees has made extremely average receivers look fantastic on the stats sheet. Tannehill isn't Brees and in my opinion, Stills will be just like Meachem and Moore who both had huge drop offs with QBs who are even better than Tannehill. We will be able to replace Stills with either a drafted WR or even Morgan is he fixes his off the field problems.  I'm even willing to say the Saints won the trade although I feel both teams walked away from it happy, no ""hosing""."
Saints,2yxcr0,ashsky,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:40:49 2015 UTC,"Tannehill isn't Brees by any means, you're right. He still threw for 4000 yards and 27 TD's, with a 67% completion rating to no name receivers besides Wallace, and they didn't get along.  He's a lot better than most people realize."

Saints,2yxcr0,saints_fan504,3,Fri Mar 13 16:56:37 2015 UTC,Fins fan here. I was excited when we signed Ellerbe initially. He has not lived up to his contract. At times he seemed slow and would miss tackles. Never really stood out. He fought off injuries during his time here so I am hoping that he will do better (coming off IR).  We were going to cut him so I'm glad we were able to put something together to obtain some talent. Here is hoping that Ellerbe does well for you guys so this trade is a win-win for both teams.

One now for Rex . and I'm guessing in May will be for Sean as will probably be going heavy on the offensive side. Also getting all these draft picks means nothing if u don't turn them into solid players. Outside of Cooks, last yrs draft was a failure so far (still waiting on Baptiste). So to have gotten Kenny in 3rd two yrs ago and to have turned him into simply another draft pick? Idk.. Seems like a pointless circle?"
Saints,2yxcr0,PABLOricardo,3,Fri Mar 13 17:02:30 2015 UTC,"Stills was a 5th round pick, not 3rd."
Saints,2yxcr0,mes8007,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:17:15 2015 UTC,Sorry made a mistake. Thanks .. But Same concept. If we take a WR it better be late. Makes no sense to use these new picks on a receiver. Whos going to take two yrs to get to where Kenny was anyway.
Saints,2yxcr0,hopefulhusband,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:25:55 2015 UTC,Agreed. Must have been more to it than just a need for a LB. Kenny was still on a rookie contract being paid next to nothing.
Saints,2yxcr0,mes8007,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:27:41 2015 UTC,Well they're reports already the line backer will be cut. He's bad for the cap. And not that great. Stills might have had some locker room issues we didn't know of. Perhaps he wasnt a workaholic. I felt the same way about jimmy tbh. I hated seeing him putting so much time into a time consuming mentally draining hobby like flying planes. And he did it through the season.
Saints,2yxcr0,pottersquash,3,Fri Mar 13 17:38:10 2015 UTC,Rex?  Don't insult the silver flowing locks of Rob with that foot loving name...
Saints,2yxaot,african_violent,14,Fri Mar 13 16:34:57 2015 UTC,So hear me out....what if loomis is trying to get enough pics to trade up and grab Amari Cooper. This might make sense seeing as we got rid of jimmy and now are shopping stills...
Saints,2yxaot,Diesel46,5,Fri Mar 13 16:37:36 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Loomis just has a lot of faith in Cooks and Toon to step up. Doubt they get rid of most of these picks to trade up and draft Cooper.
Saints,2yxaot,DaggersKnuckles,18,Fri Mar 13 16:44:22 2015 UTC,I...don't think I've seen too much from Toon to be convinced of that. :/
Saints,2yxaot,Lokipokie504,3,Fri Mar 13 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"He looked really good at the end of the year, and they've been saying he looked great in camp for at least 2 years now. I have faith in Toon. He had one really bad game against the Jets, and everyone jumped on the hate train. If you're going to jump on someone when they suck, you have to give them props when they do well. He looked like a viable starter last year, and I have faith he will do well. Don't count out Saunders either. Dudes shifty and can fly. Idk about his hands so much as I only saw him as a returner for the most part, but he could definitely bring another dimension to the team."

Saints,2yxaot,pottersquash,11,Fri Mar 13 18:17:33 2015 UTC,"If we don't get a young starter out of this, its a horrible, horrible trade.  Yes flipping a two year old 5th rounder for anything is great but Stills was productive.   Yes, with Cooks we need a bigger WR, but Stills stepped up to challenge in first year.  Yes, we need a LB and more pass rush, but our WR package is now lead by an aging Colston and Cooks who had a truncated season.  Yes, there is talent in the draft, there is ZERO guarantee you will get any of it. Theres 31 other teams out there.  You either tell me Stills had a drinking/drug problem who kept causing Joe Morgan to relapse or you admit this is a dumb move."
Saints,2yxaot,VegasSaint9,3,Fri Mar 13 16:50:56 2015 UTC,I heard it was maturity issues/ hard to get him to be focused at times. Probably wasn't living up to expectations. Also heard Brees was unhappy with both Grubbs and Stills. Might as well get something for them if they don't fit the mold.

We have limited cap space, just signed a good RB to a 4 year deal and he's proved himself last year. We have 2 decent RB's behind him (Cadet for screens, Robinson for 3rd down/backup).   I feel like this money would be better invested in defense.   Another good pass rusher maybe? I'm not one to diagnose defensive problems. But it looks like we now have some good CB's so our secondary should be good now."
Saints,2ywyhr,Mudkipz137,14,Fri Mar 13 15:15:21 2015 UTC,"They're going to let Cadet walk, and Khiry is there to spell Ingram. We need a good pass catching RB who can spread the field.

With Graham gone, surrounding Brees with weapons is one of our top priorities and Spiller will bring a dynamic that we haven't had since we traded Sproles.

Saints,2yymtb,mes8007,6,Fri Mar 13 22:58:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. U can't hop on social media and say things like ""guarantee my three yrs now or I'm going to be a problem come camp"". Especially not on a Sean Payton team.. Maybe on a Rex Ryan or Jason Garrett team."
Saints,2yymtb,TheBigO48,0,Fri Mar 13 23:09:50 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I wish he would've kept his mouth shut, really was feeling good about our CB situation."
Saints,2yymtb,mes8007,0,Fri Mar 13 23:13:01 2015 UTC,Yea he should have kept it shut. We were in middle of signing talks with Tramon Williams and Browner.. And our best cb and captain on defense hop on Instagram talking bout he want out and there's no loyalty here. Not the kind of thing u want out there in the middle of free agency signings.

Saints,2yxk6n,dean815,2,Sat Mar 14 00:26:22 2015 UTC,I would say Stills to Toon is a more significant downgrade than you'd think

Saints,2yy83q,ImShadier,5,Fri Mar 13 21:15:37 2015 UTC,"I think he'll dominate in the RZ for them. But I think if he plays most downs as a TE next to the OT, he wont be as good as Seattle fans think. He'll be good, just not in the run blocking aspect which is what fuels their offense."

Saints,2yy83q,Original_Woody,2,Fri Mar 13 21:43:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but teams stack the box when they anticipate a run to stop lynch, if they seem graham they may ease up on that giving ample room for lynch to do his thing. The hawks are solid at the read-option and play action. So I don't think it's gonna be such an easy read as you suggest."
Saints,2yy83q,ImShadier,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"The thing is, whether Jimmy or a more proficient blocker is on the end of the line, there will be an extra man in the box since the guy defending JG will frequently be on/near the line to disrupt his route within 5 yards.  The main difference is how well that extra defender gets blocked.  It's not advantageous for the Hawks to use Jimmy as misdirection on a run play most of the time."

Especially when you beat the niners down in 2013. It's a part of why I'm excited about grah coming to seattle.
Saints,2yy83q,whiskeynrye,2,Sat Mar 14 05:16:29 2015 UTC,"It's tough. I love the style of football the Hawks play, I think Russell Wilson is one of the most exciting players to watch in the NFL right now, and I live in WA state so I'm surrounded by their fans, but I can't help but be resentful over the huge losses.  I mean, the Beastquake, the 2013 blowout, then that grueling playoff loss later that year... http://i.imgur.com/EVmJc4N.gif"
Saints,2yy83q,DarkSquareBishop,2,Sat Mar 14 05:32:02 2015 UTC,"Carroll has already said he'll move him all around. He isn't just going to play one spot.  And lets be real, even when you know how Wilson and Lynch attack you, it's been hard for NFL defenses to stop when the Seahawks best 2 weapons in the air were a pair of undrafted receivers (Baldwin and Kearse). Just having Jimmy Graham out there means your LB is going to follow him leaving 1 less guy for Lynch or Jimmy is gonna be running down the seam with just a safety in between him and a 30 yard play."
Saints,2yy83q,IAteTheFridge,2,Sat Mar 14 10:12:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely too soon to tell but if the past is any indicator, a lot of out players returned to New Orleans after their failed ventures.

Saints,2yzbw1,brokenearth02,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:22:08 2015 UTC,They didn't take best player on board last yr. They took a receiver they were eyeing. He was the 3 receiver taken in first 20'ish picks
Saints,2yzbw1,mes8007,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:27:10 2015 UTC,"Just because I'm not confident in our receiver core? Brees is great at elevating his receivers but we thought guys like Toon and Coleman were going to break out and they struggled. Colston is getting older. There were plenty of games where our receivers just couldn't catch the ball. Now we've gotten rid of Graham and Stills.  Drew is a wizard, but he still needs help."
Saints,2yzbw1,AgaliareptX,1 point,Sat Mar 14 04:35:54 2015 UTC,No I mentioned that becuz I don't think its smart to use 1st round picks in back to back yrs on a receiver. We've done the 5k passing yard thing and it got us no where. Time to return to what won USA Superbowl.. Defense and well balanced offense behind a spectacular Oline. We didn't have 1st rd pick elite receivers when we won it. Don't need them now. Just need to spread the ball around. Which is probably easily done by just giving drew a bunch of guys who can catch but no one too too spectacular becuz then he gets tunnel vision. Like what we've seen as of late. We struggled to move the ball at home too much last yr depending on elite a receivers/TE (JG).
Saints,2yzbw1,mes8007,4,Sat Mar 14 06:49:26 2015 UTC,I'd feel defensive
Saints,2yzbw1,blueboybob,5,Sat Mar 14 02:41:09 2015 UTC,Would be a huge mistake. One draft class won't fix the defense and there's several spots on offense we could use some depth and get younger.
Saints,2yzbw1,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:20:06 2015 UTC,Fine I guess. I'd rather they looked to free agency for most of the defensive needs.

Saints,2yzbw1,flordeliest,2,Sat Mar 14 03:41:58 2015 UTC,Just cause you don't like a guy doesn't mean that killed their draft stock. Combine means very little. It's all about game tape. Those two are still in the top 5 of every analysts positional rankings.
Saints,2yzbw1,Saints2Death,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:48:41 2015 UTC,"I like Perryman a lot, but he came in small and ran slow at the combine. I did never really like Dawson, though. I watched their film(Dawson's after the combine), they are tackling machines."
Saints,2yzbw1,flordeliest,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:51:11 2015 UTC,"Regardless of your analysis of them, one or both are in everyone's top 5 positional rankings and Perryman is in most people's Top 50 prospects.

Saints,2yxskj,NOLAblonde,3,Fri Mar 13 18:54:35 2015 UTC,That'd be nice but it'd be hard to trade 1.31 for more than one second-round pick because most teams only have one pick in the second round (unless future year's draft picks were included).
Saints,2yxskj,bootscallahan,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:57:14 2015 UTC,Sorry. I had a brain fart. I meant a 2nd and another higher round. I'm sure some teams would be willing to give up 2 and 4. Maybe even 2 and 3 depending on who is there at the 31 spot.
Saints,2yxskj,bootscallahan,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"A second and a third would be nice (especially if it was a high second), but a team would have to be desperate for a particular player to make that deal."

If Cooper or White are available at 13, which I doubt, I wouldn't mind picking one up.  But there is alot of talent that will be around in the 2nd or 3rd at WR, and Stills was someone we picked up in the 5th, so if we get someone in the 3rd I'd say it's a suitable replacement"
Saints,2yxr38,sfzen,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:41:14 2015 UTC,"I think we're in a perfect position to take a top pass rusher at #13 (assuming one of the ""big 7"" is available), package #31 and a 3rd rounder to move up in the 1st and take a WR like Strong, or maybe a guy like Eric Kendricks or Cameron Erving, and still have the 2nd and 3rd round picks to grab a CB and other needs."

Saints,2yxf0t,saints_fan504,9,Fri Mar 13 17:08:58 2015 UTC,Yea we basically traded Stills for a 3rd and first dibs at Ellerbe.  It's not a bad trade.  Just remember that Brees makes everyone look better.

Saints,2yxf0t,Smash_Brothers,5,Fri Mar 13 17:31:17 2015 UTC,Ellerbe will either re structure or get cut.  We won't take a  big hit from cutting him because the Dolphins pay his signing bonus.  Also I've heard rumors that renegotiating was part of the trade.

Saints,2ywts7,baconlovr,4,Fri Mar 13 14:36:24 2015 UTC,"I think Mariotta available at 13 would be awesome for us. On one hand Loomis could trade down to a team like the Eagles, Cardinals or Browns at 19. That would give us an even larger bevy of picks to replenish the young and cheaper talent on our roster. Which in turn helps keep us out of cap problems on 2016 and 2017. Or we draft mariotta, keep Brees. Brees gets to win the super bowl this year and next year and retires on top just like Elway. Its a win-win for everyone."
Saints,2ywts7,nixonator1,2,Fri Mar 13 19:33:47 2015 UTC,Picks should go towards the defensive side. We have to find a franchise LB.

Saints,2ywts7,evtine,3,Fri Mar 13 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want Mariota at 13 we have way bigger needs to address than to take a project Quarterback, if he's there at 31 than sure but I highly doubt he'll fall that deep in the first round."
Saints,2ywts7,ohhgod,3,Fri Mar 13 14:48:37 2015 UTC,I just don't know when we'll get an opportunity to get a quarterback of his caliber without being like the colts and basically tanking the season after Brees goes. This would solidify our future at the most important position. We have 3 picks in the top 45. We can address defense at every other pick and with additional FA signings.

Saints,2ywts7,ohhgod,7,Fri Mar 13 14:31:21 2015 UTC,I hate this thought process. You don't think Sean Payton could build an offense around an athletic quarterback? Mariota would have 2 years of understudy with Brees. Who's the young quarterback who's most compared to Brees? Russell Wilson. You don't think Sean Payton could turn Mariota into a Russell Wilson type player with 2 full years to work with him?
Saints,2ywts7,evtine,4,Fri Mar 13 14:33:22 2015 UTC,Bigger more athletic Wilson? Yes please.
Saints,2ywts7,undress15,-4,Fri Mar 13 16:53:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting, i pleaded for us to draft RW and Saints fans on twitter called me stupid and i didnt know what i was talking about. I said hes a more athletic, stronger and faster Brees. Nope, Im stupid. He's nothing like Brees....  But seriously, i just dont see sean going after Mariota. If he does I'll be shocked, kinda mad. We need a defense. ASAP."
Saints,2ywts7,makeplayz,6,Fri Mar 13 14:41:59 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt we'll take Mariota, like you said we have needs to address and holes to plug. But to say Mariota doesn't fit the scheme makes you sound like you don't know what you're talking about."
Saints,2ywts7,ohhgod,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"We're a vertical passing offense, mariota struggles with vertical passing.."
Saints,2ywts7,makeplayz,3,Fri Mar 13 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"The Saints use a Air Croyell system. This system primarily relies a lot on receivers confusing defenders by changing routes consistently and changing their motion, creating huge windows which the QBs exploit (which is something Mariota has relied on in Oregon).   But the fact that Ingram pounded the rock for over 800 yards last year and Sean Payton really starting to rely on the run game has me convinced were moving towards a more Spread offensive scheme."
Saints,2ywts7,ohhgod,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I could see that because our offensive line transitioned to more of a zone blocking scheme to suit Ingram's one cut nature. I just really dont want Mariota. I dont like the hype of guys that play ""rockstar"" position. We're New Orleans, they never work out for us. We get by with ""unsung heroes."" If we got Mariota I'd expect a franchise QB in 2 seasons, cause I really would be ok with having Brees' heir in place. I wanted that to be RW3, but we didnt take him. But i just see that crashing and burning."
Saints,2ywts7,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:18:02 2015 UTC,"With this offseason, our offensive scheme is definitely changing. Especially with personnel we now have. Our top receivers are smaller and faster. Our o line is improved. Ingram got paid. Probably going to be more west coast than vertical. But I could be very wrong on that.   As far as the 13th pick. If Mariota is there, that probably means the top pass rushers and def tackles are gone. We can get nearly the same value from picking a corner at 13 or at 31 so I think we'd be reaching for a corner there now that we have the extra first rounder. There's no inside LB worth taking at 13 so what do you suggest we take? A receiver? I wouldn't be mad at Parker, but there's a good chance he's gone too. I like Bud Dupree but he scares me as just a workout warrior. So if we don't take Mariota, I would hope we trade back. I don't see us taking OL in the first. In this scenario, Mariota would be the best player available. Picking BPA is how you win drafts. Not reaching for needs."
Saints,2ywts7,evtine,0,Fri Mar 13 15:26:43 2015 UTC,"With Brees's diminishing arm we need to transition to a west coast offense, let brees get the ball out there quick and let cooks and stills use their speed and space to get YAC.  I agree with the BPA. We'll see."
Saints,2ywts7,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:32:22 2015 UTC,Yeah. Exactly what Mariota would be a great fit for.
Saints,2ywts7,evtine,0,Fri Mar 13 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"I could see it happening. With the 31st pick, Saints don't have to necessarily fill that LB need with the 13th. If the top tier guys are gone and Maroita falls, take him and get a playmaker with 13th.  This of course means Brees won't be extended and will likely be traded to Raiders/Browns next year (I don't believe in Derek Carr)."
Saints,2ywts7,pottersquash,5,Fri Mar 13 15:53:23 2015 UTC,You shut your whore mouth. J/k but living in Mo w/my second team being KC thinking about Brees in Oakland makes me feel sick. Almost as sick as thinking about him on any other nfcs team.

Saints,2yzbqy,scottynola,3,Sat Mar 14 02:47:52 2015 UTC,"Ben Grubbs isn't elite, and arguably is barely even above average at this point. He's old and overpriced on top of that.  Browner draws a lot of penalties but he will be our best #2 corner in years anyways, and he has the size, strength and attitude to go up against some of the big athletic WR's our division is loaded with.  The dead cap space was money already spent anyways, and we lowered our total cap number this year while clearing the books for future years. This year the cap doesn't look much better but next 2 years look  vastly improved.  We also picked up an elite O-Line player in Unger and 3 extra picks in the first 5 rounds. Losing Graham is rough (I suspect they feel they can replace him from within and that's what really made him expendable) but outside of that we are actually a little better off now and have a lot more breathing room down the line.   Did we hit a home run here? No, not really (unless those draft picks turn into a monster class and that's not a very realistic hope). But we didn't do all that bad playing small ball, and you can win that way too."

So don't get ahead of ourselves guys. 9picks don't mean anything if we have another draft like last yr. BTW.. When's last time we drafted a solid linebacker/cb or Oline player? Also we have a lot more higher round picks this year, but we need guys who can at least show promise in their rookie yr like Kenny two yrs ago. Can't go for another Baptiste (taken high but never to be seen).   1st: Cooks - Great 1st round value  2nd: Baptiste (CB)- who knows, so far a bust/disappointment. Practice squad cb Federick even beat him out late in yr when we were desperate at the position. (I still hope to see something this yr or he'll probably be cut by mid season or after training camp)  4th: Khari Fortt (LB) - cut before start of season 5th: Vinnie Sunseri (SS) - injured in Nov, but had 5 tackles before that. All special teams. Less than 5 snaps on defense.  5th: Ronald Powell (LB)- 2 tackles in 10 games. Only 3snaps on defense.

And I expect we will draft an interior linemen with our first four picks. The Unger trade has given us options.  And we are trying to sign Spiller because he brings a dynamic to the offense that we lost when we traded Sproles. Would people stop shitting on moves that will help our team? We don't have Graham any more, so giving Brees weapons to make up for that is pretty damn important."

The most questionable move to me was actually the Galette restructure, but only because of the reports that he is a locker room cancer. Other than that, every move has been even better than what I was expecting us to do. I thought we'd just cut Grubbs, but we got a pick out of it. I wanted us to get a decent center, but we got a young all-pro and a first rounder. We needed a CB2, and we got a top 5 one, with multiple Super Bowl experiences (and wins). Now we're trying to get spiller and people don't like it, after everyone crying about how well Sproles was doing in philly? It's just weird."

Saints,2yx1la,Megawatts19,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:24:24 2015 UTC,It makes perfect sense. You will never satisfy everyone. People will always find a problem with something if they want to.
Saints,2yx1la,Arcturus_,4,Fri Mar 13 19:56:54 2015 UTC,We have a proven history of drafting great lineman in later rounds of the draft. I think we should trust that and pick up a guard in rounds 3-5.
Saints,2yx1la,ThePuckeringBrown,3,Fri Mar 13 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"What hole on offensive line are you talking about? LG? I believe that Lelito or Kelemente would be more than capable of filling in for Grubbs, who was nothing more than average for us last year. We upgraded at center, Armstead is healthy, and we have Evans and Streif. Evans was reportedly hurt last year, so I'm sure that affected his performance. I'm starting to think we either grab Scherff or Collins with the 13 pick, since the pass rushing depth in this draft is pretty good."
Saints,2yx1la,Lokipokie504,2,Fri Mar 13 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think Lelito is the replacement at OG as of now. We'll see how the draft goes, but I don't think we pick up a free agent OG.   I think we definitely need to draft O-line regardless. Not only do we need a replacement for Evans (probably in the next season or two), but we also need depth. Our backup O-linemen aren't reliable, especially if Lelito will be starting."
Saints,2yx1la,sfzen,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"There also Kelemete who can backup, but I agree we should start cultivating now for next year or two. I don't think we should spend an early pick on Oline. They should be for defense, but we've been able to find good talent in later rounds before."
Saints,2yx1la,cfiggis,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"If Evans says, I say no. I LIKE Lelito and think he proved 2 years ago he could start for this team. I was glad Goodwin became center so Lelito could stay on to take over for Evans. But last year showed (against all reason) Evans is still better than Grubbs. If Evans can go one or two more years, let Lelito play other side and draft a nice mid-round small school OLine prospect (the only kind of prospect Saints seemingly always click on), OL is done."
Saints,2yx1la,pottersquash,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. I like Lelito, but as a G not a C. We now have our C, so Lelito may get his start at G opposite Evans. I can deal with Evans for another season, and like you said draft another G, maybe 3rd or 4th round (unless at 31 or 40 theres a really good G available). We need at least one more pass rusher that can get 10 sacks to give Junior and Cam some solid help.  Our 13th and 31st picks better be used on a OLB edge rusher and either the best offensive lineman on the board like i said previously or a MLB to lead our defense, like McKinney. Im hoping he's there at 31 so we can have our defensive captain of the future set with a strong edge rush and d-line to let him roam. I also feel with one of our mid round picks, we need to acquire a DT to be the 3-4 anchor. We need to stop getting lazy DTs and get someone with a high motor that just plays nasty and sets the tone. rant over, sorry lol"
Saints,2yx1la,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"Lelito played well as a Guard in 2013, hopefully he gets a chance to redeem himself after the debacle at Center last year. Anyway, we'll probably draft in interior lineman before the 5th round."
Saints,2yxhdc,pottersquash,11,Fri Mar 13 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"Staff probably told them to shut the fuck up. Or maybe since they see the team wheeling and dealing, they don't want to be the straw that breaks the camel's back and wind up being traded to the raiders."

Saints,2yx5o8,TimVicious,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"I'm excited as hell, personally. Payton's big thing this offseason was cleaning up the locker room. Jimmy, Grubbs, Stills, there was speculation that they were all locker room problems. Now, we'll never know that for certain because this organization won't drag someone through the mud like that.  So we're getting rid of guys that either half assed, were a locker room problem, or just didn't want to be here. Now. Not only are we doing all that, but we're filling other positions of need through trades and hoarding draft picks.  You people need to chill out. We're not in ""fire sale"" mode. We're not shopping Drew, just relax and enjoy the convoluted ride. We'll be just fine next year."

Saints,2yxkl4,evan466,12,Fri Mar 13 17:54:51 2015 UTC,Brees can make any receiver a deep threat.  We have no LB's.
Saints,2yxkl4,moralesupport,2,Fri Mar 13 17:58:04 2015 UTC,"True about Brees, and Tanny doesn't exactly throw the greatest deep ball.  Then again people thought Wallace was a one trick pony and he's done alright with out a ton of deep catches."
Saints,2yxkl4,saints_fan504,2,Fri Mar 13 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"It was a trick, Stills is an average 5th round wr that Brees and Payton made look good so that we could trade him."

Saints,2yxkl4,Lokipokie504,5,Sat Mar 14 13:36:38 2015 UTC,"Were not in salary cap hell. Ellerbe is going to restructure, so there's no real damage there. Stills is good, one of my favorite saints actually, but he's replaceable. Our system is predicated on spreading the ball around, so individual stars are not as important as team players who fill a role. Apparently Drew didn't like that he ""took plays offl"", so that would explain extra motive for the move. We have huge holes at LB now, and Ellerbe could help fix that. The fact that we got a 3rd is really the deal. We basically traded Stills for a 3rd and first dibs at Ellerbe."
Saints,2yxkl4,scottynola,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:08:11 2015 UTC,Are you guys not like 23 million over anymore?

Saints,2yxkl4,ThorBarnes,4,Fri Mar 13 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"Stills is a great receiver. He is just like Jarvis Landry, just a little quicker. He'll be good for years to come. You got a good pick up. He's young.   I think we got the better end though. A 3rd rounder and a starting LB is a lot."
Saints,2yxkl4,scottynola,2,Fri Mar 13 18:14:51 2015 UTC,Ellerbe gets paid starter money. But whether he deserves it is a different question. He's needs to restructure for you guys because at the moment he's way overpaid.
Saints,2yxkl4,Zynac,5,Fri Mar 13 18:19:41 2015 UTC,He will be a starter for us. I don't see anyone better on our roster as of right now. That may change the way things are going.
Saints,2yxkl4,mes8007,2,Fri Mar 13 18:24:13 2015 UTC,A 3rd option at best I can't see stills as serious 2nd option without a great qb on a contending team.
Saints,2yxkl4,sfzen,2,Fri Mar 13 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"My feelings exactly. Great speed, good hands, not much size. He's Cooks with less talent, that's why he's gone. Still, as a third option you couldn't do much better, he catches enough big passes each season to make him really worth his keep."
Saints,2yxkl4,ToddNew,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:26:08 2015 UTC,Nope nothing wrong with him as a third option. Especially on a rookie contract.  Not trying to make him seem like a bad player he just isn't going to come in and change the whole dynamic of your team.  He was still my 3rd favorite player though :(
Saints,2yxkl4,aimerj,2,Fri Mar 13 18:42:28 2015 UTC,You guys got one heck of a player on and off the field.  He was one of my favs in only a couple of seasons.  He reminds me of a bigger faster version of Lance Moore.  He should flourish with you guys. I wish him the best.

Saints,2yxfmz,TraceDAT,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:29:26 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think you guys get Dorial Green-Beckham with 31.  Graham is gone and Colston is aging.  You guys need a big body.  With Drew Brees throwing the balls, who better than to coach up than DGB?  I can see you guys drafting defense in rounds 1-4, except WR and an o-linemen.  Then another WR in the later rounds."
Saints,2yxfmz,cfiggis,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:32:02 2015 UTC,"We still have Cooks, Colston, Toon, Saunders and Coleman, as far as I know barring practice squad players. Which, we brought Brandon Coleman up from the practice squad late last season. Coleman is 6'6"" 225, basically a mold of Colston except faster more athletic and actually runs after the catch. We dont need DGB but Toon has yet to live up to the hype we had for him, he's barely touched the field and has a serious case of the drops. So having a guy ready to take his place if he doesn't ever reach potential isn't a bad thing. Im just not sure I want to spend a 1st on a project. We already did that with our 2nd round pick last year, Stanley Jean-Baptiste. If DGB is there for us at 40 I'd love it."
Saints,2yxfmz,mes8007,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:38:27 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind grabbing Nelson Agholor with one of our 3rd rd picks. He has Stills speed and does special teams.
Saints,2yxfmz,mes8007,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"I see no sense in trading away Stills only to take a 1st round WR. That's equivalent to trading a 1st round pick to the Dolphins for a 3rd round and Ellerbe, which I don't think anyone would want us to do.  No, I think we do defense defense for our 1st round picks.  Payton apparently thinks highly of our WR prospects - Seantavius Jones and Brandon Coleman. More likely we take a flyer on a later round WR to beef up our offense. Perhaps one of our 3rds or 5ths."

Already replaced Pierre's with Grahams. But going to take 2-3 guys to replace Jimmy's/Stills. And we have Toon. So I'd say we need two more guys. Probably draft someone in 4th and sign crabtree or someone else. Then we'll be OK.
Saints,2yypdz,mes8007,2,Fri Mar 13 23:19:30 2015 UTC,"I'm still psyched for Coleman.  He can make up at least 80% of jimmy if he gets comfortable.  If he puts on some weight it'd be awesome.  Graham: 6'7, 265; Coleman 6'6, 225, both having ~4.6 40 times"

Saints,2ytm9z,YOUNG_SANTA,125,Thu Mar 12 18:55:51 2015 UTC,WE WILL IN THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP
Saints,2ytm9z,Bouzal,19,Thu Mar 12 18:57:00 2015 UTC,I love the way you think!
Saints,2ytm9z,saoXcore,6,Thu Mar 12 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"In New Orleans too, tired of going out to Seattle and getting our butts kicked."
Saints,2ytm9z,WhoDat504,18,Thu Mar 12 19:34:08 2015 UTC,That's pretty strong to suggest they'll make the NFC championship a third straight year. I don't see that happening.
Saints,2ytm9z,YOUNG_SANTA,11,Thu Mar 12 19:26:35 2015 UTC,I hope losing Unger will turn their offense to shit again.
Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,16,Thu Mar 12 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Since they had him only 6 games last season and they still made the super bowl, I'm sure they'll be fine."
Saints,2ytm9z,SteakWay,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:33:00 2015 UTC,"Look at the stats man, Russel was worse and the Run game was worse too without Unger holding it down. That late season push was due a lot to having him back in the line-up."
Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,2,Thu Mar 12 20:34:23 2015 UTC,without Unger we had our Franchise-BEST total offensive yards against AZ
Saints,2ytm9z,Amerikaner83,1 point,Fri Mar 13 04:57:23 2015 UTC,Bobby wagner came back too which was equally important imo

Saints,2ytm9z,Hierospliff,1 point,Fri Mar 13 08:35:33 2015 UTC,Do you know when they got him back? I'm not sure exactly but if it was at the end then I'm excited to see Seahawks crash and burn without him. Did they have him for the playoffs too?
Saints,2ytm9z,SteakWay,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:54:47 2015 UTC,Around week 10 I think - He was present for playoffs yes. Guy is the reason that run game works so well. I mean I doubt they'll be a dumpster fire but they're pretty good.
Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,10,Thu Mar 12 20:58:14 2015 UTC,He played 6 games last years not including playoffs. Absent from week 6-9 and 12-17. Back up center Patrick Lewis played well in his stead. It's gonna be fine for the Hawks.
Saints,2ytm9z,DocHobbes_,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:04:15 2015 UTC,Well now I'm even more excited! Thanks.
Saints,2ytm9z,SteakWay,-1,Thu Mar 12 21:08:04 2015 UTC,You're only focusing on what we lost... and not what we just gained.
Saints,2ytm9z,caalroWORK,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:45:02 2015 UTC,Right...because I'm talking about Unger and his impact on the Seattle O-line. Not what Seattle lost or gained. They gained one of the best receiving TE's in recent history and gives Russel a legit receiving threat that Defenses have to honor.
Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,-1,Thu Mar 12 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"When you make comments like this. you are talking about what Seattles O-Line lost. Then you talk about Russell Wilsons performance with and without Unger, then say you're not talking about what Seattle lost or gained, and then talk about what we gained.  Sigh"
Saints,2ytm9z,caalroWORK,4,Thu Mar 12 22:32:34 2015 UTC,"The seahawks were never shit, in terms of yards yes, but if you look at their points per drive they have been top 3 in the league for the past 3 years."
Saints,2ytm9z,ry3guy09,2,Thu Mar 12 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"After the first half of the season last year no one saw them making it a second time, but they clawed back into the race."

May not always be the best corner on earth, racks up penalties too, but hes the definition of a tone-setter and someone who really gives your defense a nasty fucking attitude. (Which no offense, after last year you guys could use) Good luck."
Saints,2ytm9z,mborn,23,Thu Mar 12 18:47:51 2015 UTC,"None taken, we were fucking embarrassing last season. No one gave a shit. Hopefully Browner brings the attitude of 2013 back."
Saints,2ytm9z,TacoExcellence,18,Thu Mar 12 19:34:27 2015 UTC,None taken. Can't really argue against that point lol.
Saints,2ytm9z,Guyote_,4,Thu Mar 12 18:54:39 2015 UTC,That's why I'm most excited we got him. I'll take the 15 yarders if he brings a little swagger to this D and toughens them up. We need a guy with a little shit in his neck. Browner is exactly that.
Saints,2ytm9z,Megawatts19,25,Thu Mar 12 20:48:43 2015 UTC,Dont know how every year we sign a big name but I love it.. Keenan & browner backed up by Byrd and vaccaro should be fun
Saints,2ytm9z,rafael23,16,Thu Mar 12 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"I hear ya. Lets hope this one pays off. At least it isn't an aging big name. Ahem, Champ."
Saints,2ytm9z,pottersquash,11,Thu Mar 12 18:47:23 2015 UTC,"""Dont know how every year we sign a big name""  Cause every year we jettison 4 big names!!"
Saints,2ytm9z,chichaslocas,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:08:57 2015 UTC,That would mean we get 3 big names a year in the draft!! Wahoo!
Saints,2ytm9z,Random452,4,Fri Mar 13 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"We will need it, because we still have no MLB"
Saints,2ytm9z,pottersquash,3,Thu Mar 12 19:20:26 2015 UTC,"ILB, remember technically we are a 3-4 defense. Technically, Lofton was playing out of position (much like Vilma played out of position with Jets before coming to Saints and excelling). Thats good cause its technically easier to find a good enough to good 2nd ILB than a good enough to good MLB. Plus we still have 3 starter level safeties so you could substitute an ILB with a SS in a formation and achieve similar results.   I honestly think DT is a bigger issue now. Jenkins/Hicks/Bunkley while I am fine with either, I want better production (really thought Hicks would get there)."
Saints,2ytm9z,Random452,3,Thu Mar 12 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"yes you are right, though I remember when Rob Ryan came to town and we switched to 3-4 everyone HATED the idea I had of making Harper a LB."
Saints,2ytm9z,Marco_de_Pollo,2,Thu Mar 12 19:45:20 2015 UTC,If we don't lose Keenan.
Saints,2ytm9z,YOUNG_SANTA,23,Thu Mar 12 19:50:24 2015 UTC,That takes care of CB. Now we can draft 5 linebackers...
Saints,2ytm9z,typical0,-12,Thu Mar 12 18:55:06 2015 UTC,We're gonna do some dumb shit and draft a lb in the 5th who we'll cut halfway through the season. And trade our 2 first rounders for a bag of chips. Over this offseason.
Saints,2ytm9z,Chovinson,16,Thu Mar 12 19:41:08 2015 UTC,Browner > Robinson

Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,12,Fri Mar 13 06:07:21 2015 UTC,Time to bring the wood. Hopefully Vaccaro takes a page out of BB's book and starts hitting like a beast instead of whiffing.
Saints,2ytm9z,YOUNG_SANTA,13,Thu Mar 12 18:49:38 2015 UTC,Him trying to hit like a beast is why he whiffs so often. Sometimes he just needs to wrap up and secure the tackle. Especially if he's the last line of defense.
Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,2,Thu Mar 12 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean like blowing people up, in his first year his beastly hits were form tackles that still knocked people off their ass. See Olsen getting lit up."
Saints,2ytm9z,YOUNG_SANTA,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:30:14 2015 UTC,"He definitely wasn't the same player last year and that's why he got benched. His speed to the ball is insane though. I think he'll bounce back this year and we'll have a SOLID secondary, barring injuries."
Saints,2ytm9z,Emleaux,11,Thu Mar 12 19:35:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, Keenan Lewis - they singed a fellow Beav for the defensive backfield. Time to knock it off and settle down."
Saints,2ytm9z,LA420,13,Thu Mar 12 18:54:01 2015 UTC,Looks like browner's gonna win 3 superbowls in a row with 3 different teams!

Saints,2ytm9z,didntevenwarmupdho,6,Thu Mar 12 19:06:44 2015 UTC,Thank god you didn't say domeland security level type shit. Decent is the best we can hope for after last year!

Really glad my only jersey is a Breesus one right about now, though.)"
Saints,2yudw0,african_violent,0,Thu Mar 12 22:07:08 2015 UTC,Well. Part of the reason we're having to shop a few people is because of Brees contract. Just keep that in mind.

Saints,2yvk8e,SoundAGiraffeMakes,6,Fri Mar 13 13:19:34 2015 UTC,"My response to the Peter King comment:  And that statement has been taken out of context. Sure, Loomis will listen to anyone for any player at any time. However, that doesn't mean he's going to give you a deal on them. You want Brees? OK. Give me three firsts, your starting QB, a couple linebackers, etc.   Everyone on every team can be had at all times, but the price is too steep for many of them.  I've compared this off season to soccer's silly season. Every transfer window, someone posts a ""rumor"" that Christiano Ronaldo or Leo Messi can be bought. And they can. Problem is, no one has the funds to pay the outrageous price it would take to buy them. The same applies to elite players in the NFL. Everyone is ""available"", but at what price?"
Saints,2yvk8e,sophandros,5,Fri Mar 13 09:35:53 2015 UTC,That's exactly what people need to be thinking. A good GM is always LISTENING to offers on everyone
Saints,2yvk8e,mbluhm36420,6,Fri Mar 13 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"Ya I won't believe y'all are rebuilding in any way until Brees is gone via trade or retirement. The moves made so far actually seem to be smart, helping yall with cap issues and giving u players at positions of need. Getting a good possibly pro bowl center in unger while getting a late first rounder is a great deal to give up graham with. Signing browner now means yall can go anyway with ur picks wether it be oline(tackle or guard) or maybe another pass rusher or solid linebacker."

Cons: Be ready for the other side of the coin of his physicality; he is the most penalized CB in the NFL lol. The occasional unsportsmanlike/personal foul (at least in Seattle not sure if he did in New England) and lots and lots of DPI/Holding/etc. For us it didnt seem to cost us any games per-se or anything like that...but obviously flags aren't fun.   Overall, you just got a damn good CB in general but also one that might make some highlight reel hits & tackles.   PS- Thanks for Jimmy! He said this today: ""It put a grin on my face.. I realized I was going to the best team in Football."" so hes officially our favorite new player lol."
Saints,2ytp0t,bigevil80,2,Thu Mar 12 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"I concur with the penalties. He does get called a lot for DPI/D-Holding/Hands to the Face. However, those penalties are worth it because of the toughness he Brings to the defense. I remember after he hid Ladarius Green of the Chargers, no Chargers went across the middle.   The positive thing about the penalties is that they stopped in the playoffs. Not a lot of them were called (except for 1 bad DPI against Torrey Smith).   BB is worth it for the tenacity and the toughness he brings. He will make other guys around him tougher and bring a more physical mindset. Good Luck and treat him well Saints fan."

Saints,2ytp0t,Colosussbaine,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:33:43 2015 UTC,Man. The last two really showcase his ability to form tackle.  Here's to hoping he can teach the rest of the defensive backfield the same skillset.
Saints,2ytp0t,sart0rial,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:43:17 2015 UTC,"Pats fan here. Sad to see Browner go. I praised his play this past season and without him, Butler doesn't get the game winning interception. Unfortunately, he's a casualty of Revis heading to the Jets. Now, Belichick is going to implore a more of a ""bend don't break"" defense which I'm not a fan of, and will go heavy on the pass rush. Browner is insanely talented and will easily elevate your defense. I'm gonna miss that guy :("

Saints,2yx8uh,mes8007,7,Fri Mar 13 16:20:44 2015 UTC,I don't want him. Not at all. CJ Spiller is a much better fit and didn't(that we know of) knock out his girlfriend via punch.
Saints,2yx8uh,xbaited,2,Fri Mar 13 16:23:02 2015 UTC,I respect that opinion. I personally believe he's paid his retribution and deserves a second chance. His family has forgiven him and wants to move on. So I'd be willing to welcome him to Who DAT Nation.. But I was one of the few calling for Junior Galette to be cut after his domestic violence incident this off season. That and his just overall lack of humility and on field production has really turned me off.
Saints,2yx8uh,xbaited,0,Fri Mar 13 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"Ray Rice was really known for some charity and stuff before his whole incident, but I'm really very hesitant to give him a second chance. Violence like that, especially against someone you love, is unforgivable in my opinion."
Saints,2yx8uh,baconlovr,2,Fri Mar 13 16:35:27 2015 UTC,I would be surprised if any team touches Ray Rice this season or beyond that. I think he's seen the last of NFL play time.
Saints,2yx8uh,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"He'll be back, and I can see Bill Belichick bringing him in when one of his RBs gets hurt. A playoff contender will bring him in when they start getting thin in the backfield."
Saints,2yx8uh,Lokipokie504,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"The only way any team will take a chance on ray rice is for the league minimum, which might take some time before he's willing to take that deal. If we can't agree to terms with Spiller, I guess it could be a possibility. But, I really doubt it."
Saints,2yx8uh,bootscallahan,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:27:13 2015 UTC,Rice was on the decline before his suspension. He wouldn't be worth the money or the media frenzy.
Saints,2yx8uh,makeplayz,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:27:15 2015 UTC,"All i know is, all these Saints fans were hating him last year because of the assault. I believe everyone deserves a second chance, but ""we"" (not me) hated his guts. It would be crazy if we signed him. I wouldnt be mad if we did, had we not been able to resign Ingram. Ingram has proven he can carry the load and SP is high on Cadet, and we're likely to land Bush or Spiller (and im really hoping for a Bush return), signing RR isn't happening. I dont think any team signs RR until midseason, when a contender loses a RB to injury.  Another ""irk"" of mine in regards to fan-player relationships is Junya. Saints fans want him gone, now he ""abuses and rapes women."" Yet, (and i forget which one it is) Culliver or Cox has a rape charge on their track record, yet we as fans wanted one or the other, we didnt care, we just wanted an upgrade.  So, we'd get rid of our own to bring in someone else thats just as guilty for the same infractions. I just cant grasp my mind around that......."
Saints,2yx8uh,makeplayz,2,Fri Mar 13 16:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree. I do hope though the NFL or sports in general starts holding these guys more accountable in future. Like what we saw last yr with ray rice, Greg hardy, and AP. Although I did have mixed feelings for AP. Growing up in new Orleans, my entire family would be unemployed under the AP guidelines. Heck I went to a public elementary school in new Orleans where ur parents could sign a consent form for the principal to whip u. And this was only like 15-20 yrs ago. I'm only 27.  But its a new day and age. And I guess parents need to be more educated and informed about the effects of capital punishment."
Saints,2yx8uh,Chovinson,2,Fri Mar 13 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"Im 28, from SW MS, and my parents beat my ass with a belt and whipped my legs with a switch. I congratulate AP (in a sense) for at least disciplining his child. maybe the extent at which he did so was a tad too much. But something tells me these middle class white people losing their shit over AP, that their kids disrespect them and walk all over them, ive seen it with my aunt and her two sons, 8 and 10. If she did what AP did, my two cousins wouldnt be little shits that I want to slap every time Im around.  Everyone has their way of parenting, and I think people overreacted too much to the AP thing. In America, we overreact a lot. We like to make everything seem more important than it really is, which is basically attention seeking. So it is what it is. AP seems like a good man and i give him the benefit of the doubt."

Saints,2yu6nm,Beardycitrus,7,Fri Mar 13 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"I'm warming up to the idea of signing Spiller.  Our CB signing was more affordable than I expected, and if we use a draft pick or a guy on the roster to plug in at guard I feel like the money is there for a 3mil/year, incentive heavy contract. It's important that Payton get his offense where he wants it to be so that all remaining resources can go to the Defense... and Payton loves his receiving backs.   Edit: Spiller's 2014 KR stats-     Ret Yds Avg TD Long    10 306 30.6 1 102    Not too shabby for a position where we have a huge need."

Saints,2yuz6f,KTDL,3,Fri Mar 13 02:28:10 2015 UTC,He is a bigger guy that can play at any position on the defensive line and get pressure pretty consistently. Plays the run fairly well and has a good nose for getting to the football. Probably our best non starting defender.

Saints,2ytlzc,sfzen,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"But that #31 overall pick is the perfect place to pick up an ILB. #13 would have been a big reach for the best ILB, and our 2nd rounder would probably have left us with the 3rd or 4th guy. We might get lucky and have Kendricks fall."
Saints,2ytlzc,whodat951,9,Fri Mar 13 13:53:47 2015 UTC,....i was being sarcastic.
Saints,2ytlzc,Megawatts19,2,Thu Mar 12 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"Is expect defense with 2 of the first 3 picks. Maybe ILB at 13, OG at 31 then OLB at 44. Should be fun to see who we get. Even though the FO moves haven't been popular with the fans, they are definitely smart moves. Off loading Lofton, Graham, and Grubbs is Huuuge cap relief."
Saints,2ytlzc,blackngold14,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but am tired of hearing about Mickey Loomis being a God. Yes he is a capable GM and I think has done a good job, but ultimately he scooped and tossed salaries down the line to put the team in win-now mode and now he's scaling back and trying to convert us from offensively balanced Goliath to a ground pounding offense with solid defense. Maybe it will work, I don't know. I definitely don't like the idea of taking weapons away from our highest paid player to work with and sure hope we don't dump Stills.  Not that you said Loomis is all that but tons of others mindlessly imply that because Loomis made these moves they will magically pan out and it's annoying"
Saints,2ytlzc,MrTQ,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I hear what you saying...but at this point, its pretty much fact defense wins games. In 06, nobody knew who a 7th round pick out of Hofstra was in Colston. He became a God. Brees makes the guys around him better, and with an improved o line and a more balanced rushing attack with superstar Mark Ingram, we should see Brees improve. And remember 09, we had playmakers on defense putting Brees on a short field. Don't ever underestimate that. These were absolutely the right moves. The past few years, I have been frustrated with our continuing to draft offensive skill players and neglect grooming defense electing to rely on free agency for that aspect completely. I will be happy to see us be a more balanced football team. We should have never signed graham to that huge deal, but the good thing is we got some return from it. As always Go Saints and Who DAT!!!!!"
Saints,2ytc42,elbuzzard,11,Thu Mar 12 17:25:49 2015 UTC,21.5M in dead money this year. We might be out of cap hell next year.
Saints,2ytc42,myxanders,10,Thu Mar 12 17:33:40 2015 UTC,We were out of cap hell in 2016 with Graham and Lofton.
Saints,2ytc42,Saints2Death,10,Thu Mar 12 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"Damn. I like saying something about players in other team's subreddits when they sign or trade for a former Chief but I can't here.   What I can say though is that a 5th round pick is probably the best possible deal for Grubbs considering the situation the Chiefs are in. The Chiefs desperately need guards and are almost certainly going to have the maximum of 4 compensatory picks to make it safer to trade one of our actual picks. If there's any team that would overpay for Grubbs, it would be the Chiefs so I'm pretty certain that this is either going to be an even trade or one that ends up favoring the Saints."
Saints,2ytc42,BusinessCashew,11,Thu Mar 12 17:58:50 2015 UTC,That seems like a pretty low price to me.
Saints,2ytc42,ImShadier,12,Thu Mar 12 17:26:55 2015 UTC,It's not.  The Chiefs are taking on his ridiculously bloated contract.  We're lucky we didn't have to give them picks to take him.

Saints,2ytc42,Trayl,3,Thu Mar 12 18:32:01 2015 UTC,You say that. But he wasn't exactly great last year. Has been getting worse with age and was likely going to get even worse beyond that this year.

Saints,2ytc42,ImShadier,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:55:26 2015 UTC,"Wait, I'm not seeing a signing bonus in 2015, so wouldn't we be saving all 6.5 million?  Not to mention 7.2 million next year."
Saints,2ytc42,flordeliest,3,Thu Mar 12 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"We payed the signing bonus and guaranteed money already, for the Chiefs the contract is hardly an issue, at about 6.5mill and his hit next year was only 7 mil. It was to late too cut him, what we did absorbed is now dead money.   This was a bad trade we already took the hit and his cost was only 7 mil next year."
Saints,2ytc42,ImShadier,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:53:24 2015 UTC,"I'm understanding it better now, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong.    We've given him a total of 16 million in signing bonuses on his 5 year deal which comes to 3.2 million per year we are responsible for.  His base this year is 6.5, so we free up (6.5-3.2) 3.3 million.  Next year, his base is 7.2, we're still on the hook for 3.2 of that, so we free up 4 million next year.  Am I doing it right?"
Saints,2ytc42,flordeliest,3,Thu Mar 12 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I personally don't think the hole is worth the dead money,  if his play had declined we could have just asked for a pay-cut or cut him next year.   If cap space is what we needed why didn't we cut him before the 8th?"
Saints,2ytc42,IAMBATMAN29,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:04:29 2015 UTC,hole?  It won't be that hard to replace him because he wasn't that great.  Pretty average.
Saints,2ytc42,flordeliest,0,Thu Mar 12 19:54:38 2015 UTC,Grubbs was one of the better guards in the league.

Saints,2ytc42,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 21:20:50 2015 UTC,We are not on the hook for anything in 2016. Dead money only affects the current year unless they are a designated June 10 cut.

Saints,2ytc42,Lokipokie504,2,Thu Mar 12 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"I guess I am more worried about who will replace him.  If we were going to cut him, then yes it is good to get something."
Saints,2ytc42,backgrinder,2,Thu Mar 12 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"I think Grubbs is just an average guard at this point of his career, and Lelito or Kelemente could easily replace him. If not, maybe we grab Scherff or Collins with the 13th pick and possibly upgrade over him."
Saints,2ytc42,IAMBATMAN29,2,Thu Mar 12 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"When they picked up Unger one of my first thoughts was ""does this mean Lelito is a bust, or are they planning on making him a guard?"""
Saints,2ytc42,flordeliest,2,Thu Mar 12 17:45:09 2015 UTC,I agree.  He was pretty average.  He won't be hard to replace.
Saints,2ytc42,ImShadier,2,Thu Mar 12 19:55:12 2015 UTC,We created another hole for a fifth round pick and 3mil in cap space.
Saints,2ytc42,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:39:38 2015 UTC,We created another hole in order to fill 2 or 3 other holes in FA.
Saints,2ytc42,ImShadier,6,Thu Mar 12 17:51:45 2015 UTC,What hole do you think we can fill with an extra 3 mil avid a fifth round pick?  At best this is a huge hole for a hole and a half filled.  My expectations for a fifth round pick are very low.
Saints,2ytc42,whiskeynrye,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:57:39 2015 UTC,I think that 3 million will help sign a CB and a Receiving Back in the coming days.  The 5th rounder is just gravy and who knows maybe we get lucky.

Saints,2ytc42,ThatBoiiBryan,2,Thu Mar 12 17:32:29 2015 UTC,I think Lelito will make a fine guard he is quick and can  Handel most DT .. I think i would need a change of pants if we could get Brandon Scherff at 31 though
Saints,2ytc42,mystik3309,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:10:19 2015 UTC,Expect one of the two to take his spot and honestly it'll be really hard for them to play quite as bad as Grubbs last year.
Saints,2ytc42,YOUNG_SANTA,6,Fri Mar 13 01:14:21 2015 UTC,We were gunna cut him anyways so at least we got compensation and cleared a good chunk of space off the books

Saints,2ytc42,lossaysswag,2,Thu Mar 12 18:01:47 2015 UTC,Well Grubbs is a guard & La'el Collins plays tackle and is not the right  built to slide over  ... However i like for us to take Brandon Scherff and convert him to Guard
Saints,2ytc42,pottersquash,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:56:04 2015 UTC,It's not about size it's about his speed  and Collins is near  the bottom of the tackels. I think he is a second round pick

Nice young player, just not worth worth tying up our entire cap for a TE who cant block and seems more and more to only be in games on special packages when u have a elite qb like Brees. Let's get back to putting talent around Bree's on the defensive side and on the O line. Also let's give credit to Loomis!!! He played it very nicely when u look at Dallas. They lost demarco for nothing today!! So it was great he had the vision to lock him up and pay him elite bucks, give it a yr to see the results, and then get something in return."

Cam Jordan was worked out at least one year now, was still slightly above average last year imo. M. Jenkins was also good.

He is a press only corner we don't need to be paying 7+ mil for. We could have signed a younger more complete corner for less and been just fine.   Thurmond signed a one year contract for 3.5 mil with 2 mil guaranteed with the Eagles. Cox is going to get maybe a little more than that from the Titans.
Saints,2ythrn,jwyzzle,6,Thu Mar 12 18:16:25 2015 UTC,jesus christ man chill. The people making these moves know more about football and the team than you can begin to understand.
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,-1,Thu Mar 12 18:19:02 2015 UTC,Why do you think Browner is a free agent and the Pats didn't pick up his 7 mil option? He simply isn't worth that.  Browner isn't exactly a shutdown corner.
Saints,2ythrn,jwyzzle,2,Thu Mar 12 18:27:40 2015 UTC,They also didn't resign Revis...
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:37:04 2015 UTC,Yeah and look at Revis' new contract. The definitely couldn't match that let alone value.
Saints,2ythrn,jwyzzle,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:44:14 2015 UTC,If they wanted him bad enough they would have kept him. My point was that you can't judge every player just bc a team won't resign them. Cowboys let Murray go. Hell the Saints themselves traded Graham. Browner was a solid corner at Seattle and rob Ryans defensive sheme is closer to that than the Patriots. He will do fine here. Besides ANYBODY is better than Patrick Robinson.
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,0,Thu Mar 12 19:05:59 2015 UTC,We aren't paying Browner seven mil but his signing doesn't solve the problems we had on defense. We will still get beat on deep balls constantly.
Saints,2ythrn,wbro322,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:11:02 2015 UTC,Wether I agree with that or not....Deep threat was FAR from the biggest problem on defense. Our secondary couldn't tackle. Browner is a hard hitter. Patrick Robinson couldn't cover his own ass with both hands. Browner is a solid corner even IF I did agree that he loses his man deep. What you're asking for is a player that is an all star at every aspect of the position and those are rare and/or expensive.
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,0,Thu Mar 12 19:19:23 2015 UTC,I just hoped we signed a guy with more consistent in deep situations. Is going to be just as difficult to keep leads as last year IMO.
Saints,2ythrn,wbro322,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:25:00 2015 UTC,He's a voice and fire we need. He's got a lot of presence. He's physical. He may not be the best but you damn sure know when you get hit by him.
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,0,Thu Mar 12 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"But he is beat on the deep ball just as much as the guys we have now. He doesn't help us run man, all he brings is some good press coverage, but he will need constant safety help. It's not fixing our problems."
Saints,2ythrn,wbro322,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:32:17 2015 UTC,He's an improvement from anything we have at secondary besides keenan. Also leadership goes a long way with what we don't have right now in that department besides drew. Personally I think this will be a complete secondary for us and I'm the draft we can focus on the holes in the front 7. No secondary is perfect but we will have a strong one this year barring injury.
Saints,2ythrn,flordeliest,0,Thu Mar 12 18:38:48 2015 UTC,Is not a complete secondary of we only have one guy who isn't beat deep. The team is not that much improved since we traded a probowler for a fifth round pick to sign him.
Saints,2ythrn,saints_fan504,2,Thu Mar 12 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Ok well you can live in the Robinson and white world we were in them and I'll be celebrating our new tone setter. We're not paying for the best cornerback. We're paying for leadership, physicality, and attitude. He's a cb2 on top of that."

Saints,2ytmb5,itsaghost,2,Thu Mar 12 19:20:39 2015 UTC,We're trying out the new 3-0-8 defense with no linebackers and 8 defensive backs

Saints,2ytmb5,moralesupport,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:39:47 2015 UTC,Think he will play well for Saints Liked his play in the SuperBowl  Sean Payton had specific players he targeted to attain.  Deal worth $18 m which is reasonable
Saints,2ytmb5,Diesel46,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:49:54 2015 UTC,18 mil. Not sure how much garunteed not terrible..not great. But getting a good corner in the draft is basically a crap shoot and we desperately needed a cb2
Saints,2ytmb5,watchout4mikem,0,Thu Mar 12 19:38:25 2015 UTC,"Soo uh...to early to bring back the whole ""dome land defense"" moniker?"
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,4,Thu Mar 12 18:52:52 2015 UTC,NO NO NO NO NO! They have to earn it!
Saints,2ytmb5,Lokipokie504,-2,Thu Mar 12 19:15:36 2015 UTC,The hole point of signing an extra corner was to get a guy who isn't beat deep as much as the guys we have now. I'm not sure Browner helps with that. He is 31 and we signed him to a 3 year deal. The team is reasonably worse from trying to clear cap space for him.
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:42:53 2015 UTC,"I disagree, especially if we get a great passrusher in the draft. His press will make it hard for the QB to get the ball out quickly. Not to mention that he matches up perfectly against Benjamin, Evans, and Roddy white. You must not be a big believer in Byrd either. He will be a true FS and cover those deep balls ."
Saints,2ytmb5,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Mar 12 18:45:25 2015 UTC,Just like how Byrd covered up Robinson and White getting beat deep. This doesn't solve our problems. We still need to get an ILB to cover the middle of the field and is unlikely we will be able to sign one after this. Now we have a hole in the line and relay on untested back up or draft a replacement. The team is reasonably worse.
Saints,2ytmb5,Lokipokie504,3,Thu Mar 12 18:55:45 2015 UTC,"dammit man, did someone piss in your cheerios this morning?"
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Well you're just a negative Nancy, aren't you? If you think we can't replace Grubbs with just any decent guard, then I don't know what to say to you. He was average, nothing more nothing less. Byrd was less than 100% before last season, and had to learn an entirely new DEFENSE, not just a scheme. He was the second best FS in the game after ET3 in Buffalo. All he needs to be is a top 5-10 FS and we'll be perfectly capable. An improved pass rush will also make it easier on them. His attitude and toughness will also help this team. Guys listen to a 2 time Super Bowl winner."
Saints,2ytmb5,Saints2Death,-1,Thu Mar 12 19:00:49 2015 UTC,"I value Browner but he doesn't solve our problems on defense.  We are still going to be beat deep constantly, we still don't have a ILB who can cover. BPA in the draft is almost impossible at this point."
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"You realize the last two teams Browner played on won a Super Bowl and were two of the best defenses in the NFL. Why are you acting like he's a liability getting beat all the time? If he was beat deep all the time, do you think the Patriots and the Seahawks would have been as good as they were with him starting for them?"
Saints,2ytmb5,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:14:23 2015 UTC,His press is best in the league. His press won the Pats the Superbowl.  If he didn't jam Kearse that rub route would have been a touchdown and Butler wouldn't have had a chance to pick it off.
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:28:04 2015 UTC,And that won't benefit us?
Saints,2ytmb5,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:28:48 2015 UTC,It will but it won't solve our problem with blown coverages. After five yards Browner is a less than average corner.
Saints,2ytmb5,Lokipokie504,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:31:32 2015 UTC,So blown coverage was a big deal for the Pats last year and LOB? Because that would be news to me.
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"Like I said, if you think that then you have no faith in Byrd and Vacarro or our pass rush. There are at least 3 LB's in the draft we could fill that hole and be able to cover, my favorite being Kendricks. I'm more of the mind that what we suffered from last year was a lack of leadership combined with injuries. Browner comes in and is an immediate upgrade at our CB2, and brings the leadership we need. You act like Browner constantly gets beat deep. CB2 was 1 out of 3 of our biggest needs, and we got the 3rd best one in FA, for 3 million less than Flowers and 5 million less than Maxwell. You're being extremely pessimistic, and it's unwarranted IMO."
Saints,2ytmb5,ohhgod,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:16:00 2015 UTC,That's another thing that bugs me there are literally only 3 or 4 worth wild ILBs in this draft class. What if we don't get one?
Saints,2ytmb5,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:26:41 2015 UTC,did you even see the free agent ILB 's this year? slim pickens my friend
Saints,2yvn2p,jordanwidrig,11,Fri Mar 13 04:33:50 2015 UTC,And? We're going to utilize the fuck out of Drew Brees and any new toys we get him.
Saints,2yvn2p,Megawatts19,2,Fri Mar 13 05:22:00 2015 UTC,"i posted this in another thread, but it's already buried and most likely won't see any input.  new toys...  what are our best options?  can crabtree live up to his potential if he accepts breesus into his life?  is bowe a valid stop-gap worth pursuing for the same reason (at least for his run blocking)?  do we target someone in the 2nd and hope for the best?"

Saints,2yvn2p,ThePuckeringBrown,1 point,Fri Mar 13 11:51:20 2015 UTC,"I don't want either of them, really. Bowe has been meh for most of his career. Crabtree just seems like a headcase to me. And I may be the wrong person to talk to about the draft because I haven't been keeping up with projections or anything."
Saints,2yvn2p,Megawatts19,2,Fri Mar 13 09:40:18 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like a joke for obvious reasons, but Crabtree is honestly super mediocre, and so is Bowe...  Maybe they could be better with Brees passing to them, but I wouldn't be too excited about getting either of those guys"
Saints,2yvn2p,Wolverigne,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:08:57 2015 UTC,No I agree. If I had to choose I'd choose Crabtree but I'd really like have have neither.
Saints,2yvn2p,Megawatts19,3,Fri Mar 13 18:46:13 2015 UTC,if he  had trouble holding onto balls thrown by brees i doubt wilson will be much better.
Saints,2yvn2p,chezizzle,4,Fri Mar 13 05:43:00 2015 UTC,"I promise you that Jimmy is way more a product of Brees than the other way around. Our offense is predicated around ball distribution. We don't need a single amazing target, just a bunch of good ones, which we have. I doubt Colston has another year like last year, Stills, Cooks, and Toon are still here. Josh Hill and Ben Watson are more than capable, and are probably better for our offense from a balance standpoint. They aren't as good of receivers, but are head and shoulders above Jimmy at blocking. This will allow us to run better, and utilize the PA better. I loved Jimmy, but our offense will e absolutely fine without him."
Saints,2yvn2p,Lokipokie504,3,Fri Mar 13 13:49:28 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying but look at this past SB. Wilson threw to this nobody WR and made him amazing. He also had a height advantage like Jimmy, so if Wilson has two targets this year and the LOB, the Seahawks are going to rack up some points"
Saints,2yvn2p,Lokipokie504,2,Fri Mar 13 18:21:22 2015 UTC,"What does that have to do with the Saints? I don't care about the Seahawks. And if we play them, browner will shut him down. It's a win win for us."
Saints,2yvn2p,SputnikSauce,2,Fri Mar 13 18:22:52 2015 UTC,"You really think Browner can shut down Graham? Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge browner fan but he's no Chancellor."
Saints,2yvn2p,Lokipokie504,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:08:12 2015 UTC,"Talib did it, and browner is better and more physical IMO."
Saints,2yvn2p,SputnikSauce,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:22:54 2015 UTC,I agree he's more physical but coverage wise I think talib takes it. This has made me really curious now
Saints,2yvn2p,Lokipokie504,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"Jimmy doesn't struggle with good coverage. Jimmy struggles against physicality. Get in his face and rough him up, and you can take him out of a game."
Saints,2yvn2p,SluggSlackjaw,2,Sun Mar 15 15:24:23 2015 UTC,Wilson also threw to a nobody corner as well
Saints,2yvn2p,CajunBmbr,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Remember this though.  Each second that goes by, Lynch is getting older. He is the true key to the offense. The more their offense leans on Wilson and the passing game the better it will be for us and anyone that wants the Seahawks to fail.  Then also remember Wilson is about to go from basically an unpaid intern to one of the highest paid players in the NFL. That is when the little dream world the Seahawks have been living in will end.  It's coming soon.  Payton and Loomis seem to be ready to throw down and remake our team into a champion again as well."
Saints,2ytpbb,atn420,3,Thu Mar 12 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"We have an LB! Wooohooo. Seriously, Ill take anything at this point."

Saints,2ytpbb,saints_fan504,2,Thu Mar 12 19:32:40 2015 UTC,Humber brought the lumber when he had his chance. Solid signing.
Saints,2ywqjf,mpd31,8,Fri Mar 13 13:46:36 2015 UTC,Idk why everyone thinks we need another TE. I really believe Hill is a stud in the making.
Saints,2ywqjf,Lokipokie504,3,Fri Mar 13 13:50:50 2015 UTC,It's a depth issue above all. Watson's older. Hill hasn't played full duty of snaps. Just another guy as a security blanket. Plus for jumbo packages we want to be able to run fake on and have plenty of solid targets.
Saints,2ywqjf,GreenVisorOfJustice,2,Fri Mar 13 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"The only reason Hill didn't play was because of Jimmy. I think Hill is akin to a young Witten. He doesn't have the big play ability of Jimmy, but I think he's more sure-handed and a much better blocker. Plus, he actually breaks tackles and fights for the ball, unlike Jimmy. The fact that he is a much better blocker will actually open up our offense because PA will be much more effective. When Jimmy was in, they didn't have to respect the run as much."
Saints,2ywqjf,Lokipokie504,3,Fri Mar 13 14:08:32 2015 UTC,I'm really excited to see Josh Hill get more play time.
Saints,2ywqjf,baconlovr,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:35:13 2015 UTC,I don't think he's an obvious upgrade over Hill and Watson. I think we should pick up another atletic project player like Graham. Those first 2 picks are going to be OG and defense. I highly doubt they draft a TE high.

Saints,2yxvzu,flordeliest,-4,Fri Mar 13 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"It better be for Winston, I don't want a system QB who hasn't even huddled since highschool.  It will take at least a year for Mariota to be ready to start in our offense.  The whole idea with Winston is pretty stupid, not to mention Mariota."
Saints,2yxvzu,xbaited,2,Fri Mar 13 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"You realize in Mariota's pro day he took every single snap from under center and huddled for every play, right?

The system very obviously played to his strengths, but he can absolutely play. He can and will play under center. He isn't a one-trick read option pony. Mark my words on that."

Saints,2ysqbs,Lokipokie504,5,Thu Mar 12 14:44:24 2015 UTC,I don't think any team is looking at him as a CB1. Saints are an awesome fit. Browner w/ safety help against Julio might be the answer to our prayers.
Saints,2ysqbs,dean815,6,Thu Mar 12 14:59:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, I want him. I just don't think 5 mil is a ""major"" push. Seems like a low figure to me is all I'm saying."
Saints,2ysqbs,Lokipokie504,6,Thu Mar 12 15:10:33 2015 UTC,It does say more than $5 million.  $7 million is still more than $5 million.   Just saying.
Saints,2ysqbs,smokeajay,2,Thu Mar 12 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"true. the 5mil number could be in reference to the 5.5 mil extension NE declined, rather than saying it is between 5 and 6 mil."

Thurmond got a 3.25 mil deal, and he was just a depth signing. Maxwell got 11 mil a year (way too much for him IMO), and flowers got 9 mil a year. Browner is on the tier just below them, so I would expect him to be able to get about 7 a year."

Saints,2ysqbs,CxHxUxBxBxS,6,Thu Mar 12 15:34:17 2015 UTC,And hopefully Vaccaro can return to the form he was showing in his rookie year. I think a healthy Byrd alongside him will allow him the freedom to do what he does best.

Saints,2ytbs4,GreenVisorOfJustice,0,Thu Mar 12 18:16:31 2015 UTC,I'm sorry have you seen them play. Kelemete was terrible when he filled in for Grubbs last year and Lelito couldn't beat out 35 year old Goodwin for the starting job. Practice squad players Becton or Miller might be better than those two.
Saints,2ytbs4,flordeliest,3,Thu Mar 12 17:41:41 2015 UTC,"Lelito was a shitty center, chief.  He is actually a fairly serviceable guard when he filled in for Evans a few years back (must have been in '13).  That other kid looked okay in preseason.    Also keep in mind, our center sucked last year.  A guard's job is WAAAAY harder when the Center is doing nothing but snap the ball.  Evans and Grubbs struggled all year to protect the interior (hence our move to get Unger).  So, yes, I stand by my opinion based on what I've seen when they were given a fair opportunity."
Saints,2ytbs4,GreenVisorOfJustice,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:15:17 2015 UTC,"But seriously though, the Chiefs can Only offer a 5th? That is kind of a steal, don't you think?"

Saints,2yozym,PABLOricardo,10,Wed Mar 11 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"Does that make Aqib Talib a top 5 corner? It's not shutdown corners that control him, it's any corner over 6'. All any team has to do is put a tall corner and bump him at the line and he throws the play away."

Peterson is 6'1"" 230, one of the most gifted corners in the game and couldn't stop him.    I don't know why people sell him short, there's a reason he is a matchup nightmare.

Saints,2yozym,Dabeston,2,Wed Mar 11 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"You're right, they covered him for goal line and some plays that it fit the defense.   He wasn't shadowed the entire game.     That also speaks to the point that every team can't line someone up against him."
Saints,2yozym,diablosinmusica,6,Wed Mar 11 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"actually they only covered him when he was spread out wide, which was around 40% of his pass plays.

Saints,2yozym,kajunkennyg,5,Wed Mar 11 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"I saw an article earlier showing a graphic of pressures on Brees in '12, '13, and '14.  I believe '12 and '13 were somewhere in the 40's or 50's whereas '14 shot up over 100.  Moreover, my personal observations were that Grubbs and Evans are still VERY effective and, hopefully, Unger can enable them to get back to doing their job.  all in all, I think I feel better about this situation the more I read substantial pieces on what our problems are and what we're getting instead of focusing on what we lost.  That said, I wonder if there's any TE's on the market we're looking at that we can snag at a reasonable price and perform a similar role.."
Saints,2yozym,Ratsofftoyo,7,Wed Mar 11 17:50:59 2015 UTC,When don't necessarily need a TE. Graham didn't do any tight end things other than run routes within 5 yards of a tackle.
Saints,2yozym,sfzen,2,Wed Mar 11 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"But as a matter of depth, I think we need a third guy (as well as, if we are going for a power run, for jumbo packages, especially where we want to fake the run and have a worthwhile target)."
Saints,2yozym,DaveThe_blank_,0,Wed Mar 11 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"Colston, Cooks, and Stills. Hill has also been really good in limited snaps, especially around the goal line. Out of 20 catches, 5 were TDs.   Edit: I'm dumb, you meant 3 TEs. We do have a third under contract, but I think it's a future's contract."
Saints,2yozym,mankstar,2,Wed Mar 11 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"we still have Benjamin Watson right? He's a solid TE as well. I think it's a battle between Watson and Hill for the start, and we can draft a 3rd TE late in the draft."

I'm not sold that we need another TE, maybe we should sign RB to come in to return kicks, catch the ball out of the back field.   After looking at the stats, I think RB can get us 800+ yards total offense with rushing and catching the ball out of the back field. Which is roughly what he and DS averaged as a Saint."
Saints,2yozym,wolfbrother180,7,Thu Mar 12 10:28:32 2015 UTC,"Max Unger is a very talented player, when he wasn't on the field there was a noticeable weakness in the Seahawks offense."

Saints,2yozym,thegr8vabwavo,8,Wed Mar 11 21:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think that after the initial shock wears off, you can't see it as a bad move for you guys. You needed a center way more than a TE, and Graham was a great bargaining chip to land a great center. Good list."
Saints,2yozym,Megawatts19,6,Wed Mar 11 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"Graham is a luxury and a damn good one. There's only a hand full of pass catchers in NFL history on his level in the red zone. But this is a luxury we can't afford.   I want to be sure to convey that our offense is better with Jimmy Graham than without. But that doesn't mean we're going to go first to worst because he's not there. We can take a hit on Brees' weapons, which are still plentiful, and spend the money we save in 2016 and 2017 on improving areas where we struggle.  And the upgrade at line with Unger, keeping Ingram for 4 more seasons on a relatively small contract and having the flexibility of having three picks in the Top 43 (I think) to bring in quality rookies on rookie contracts."
Saints,2yozym,djmcintyre,4,Wed Mar 11 22:42:22 2015 UTC,"I always feel like the Saints try to emulate NE. As much as I hate the Pats, this never feels like a bad thing to me. We used what we had to get something we need. Graham is irreplaceable, but this is a team sport. I still have faith in Brees, Ingram, Colston, Hill, and Cooks on my offense at the same time behind an improved o-line, as we all should. If our defense sees ANY improvement, I will actually be quite pleased with our offseason."

Saints,2yozym,KTDL,5,Wed Mar 11 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"Guess I could have worded that better. We are successful (minus last season) for the same reasons they are: good owner, hc, and QB. The moves we are making now seem more like making the kinds of moves that NE would make. I understand people who actually make these decisions FOR A LIVING are doing it, and not me, but these moves seem very calculated and built on a vision of overall success i.e. the goddamn Patriots."
Saints,2yozym,brandonie187,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:47:18 2015 UTC,Well minus the whole draft aspect where we have a habit of trading up for players where the Patriots build massive depth by trading back each draft.
Saints,2yozym,aimerj,2,Wed Mar 11 19:52:27 2015 UTC,"Well, everyone knows we can't draft our way out of our paper bags. At least it's beginning to look like our most recently drafted heisman-winning RB (who we, of course, traded up for lol) might actually be utilized fully."
Saints,2yozym,brandonie187,5,Wed Mar 11 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"Why do people like Graham?  It is largely because of his physical stature, being 6'7"" and +260lbs. That implies that this guy is a physical beast. Most of the time he doesn't play like it. For a monster of a body, this guy offers nothing in the run game and is only effective in the pass game against linebackers and safeties. Say what you will about his predecessor, Jeremy Shockey, at least Shockey was a major contributor to the run game. The whole point of having a monster tight end (like Gates, Gronk, Gonzalez, et al) is that you will get a 21/11 defensive personnel package. With Graham, a guy who is NOT a factor in the run game, they can just say ""F it...its 4 WR set"" and sub in a dime package against him, neutralizing the offensive advantage in the passing game.  Last year, we were told he was hurt near the last part of last season (plantar fascia) which was his excuse for disappearing in the final games of 2013. This year, we're told that his shoulder injury is what is responsible for his erratic performances. However, even before the shoulder injury, Jimmy routinely loafed on plays (even routes) and had an issue with drops. As a result, the offense sputtered. Compounding issues even further is Brees' reliance on Graham since 2013 where he gets tunnel vision on passes and isn't looking to distribute the ball to the other targets.   Payton (or whoever is calling the plays) is dead-set on relying on 5-step/7-step passes with 5-man protection....meaning every route (besides flare release) is going to be >12 yards. This has lead to a lot of sputtered drives (drops, pressures, sacks) when it doesn't pan out. This isn't the 2006-2009 deliberate offense of aggressive tempo, quick game, slow screens, inside zone, and hit big with vertical shots, now its all-or-nothing drives right out of the gate. We've seen its more often ""not"" than anything else.  In 2014, we paid for a $70M offense, yet struggled to consistently to convert downs and put up >30 ppg (knowing it doesn't have a lights out defense). I'd say fans have a right to feel frustrated that Brees and Graham aren't producing up to their compensation. To be fair, this isn't the New Orleans Jimmy Grahams......it is the Saints, we all shouldn't be held hostage based on if #80 feels like showing up or not.   I don't think anyone would be making these silly excuses for any other player in the league for 4 years  I'm not saying he's hot garbage, everyone here is saying he is 1) WAY overpaid and 2) not showing any desire to be the best in the league, let alone trying to win the Saints games single-handedly. I think what most fans see is a guy interested in growing his brand by racking up statistics. We can't do anything about #1, but the fact that #2 is a reality, he should be considered a Martellus Bennett, not a Gronkowski.  I like how Julio Jones has a major injury yet finds a way to gut it out in a pivotal game to dominate.  Funny how Cam Newton, 2 weeks removed from a serious car wreck, comes back to fight for his team's playoff chances.  Yet, Graham has a shoulder sprain and juat can't grit through it to make meaningful catches and cannot be relied on to block anyone."
Saints,2yozym,aimerj,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that was very well thought out. He just hasn't been the same since part of 2012 and since the Patriots game in 2013. After that he lost a significant amount of passion. In 2011, THAT Jimmy Graham deserved the money he got. He single handedly one games for us at times, although that whole offense was on fire, but much to his credit. This was a good trade, and I hope we use that 31st pick wisely."
Saints,2yozym,bank77666,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:33:02 2015 UTC,"yeah you rite. in 2011 and 2012 he way overplayed his rookie contract. It really sucks in the NFL of today you can't really reward players relative to their production until you restructure, and then you're making an investment on what they've done in the past (not really what they will be worth the next 3 seasons).  It is just unfortunate that once players do get the contract that rewards them, they lose all motivation for raising the bar for their personal legacy. Once Graham got paid, he had ""arrived"" and there was no point in him continuing to work hard because it came so easy for him."
Saints,2yozym,WhoDat504,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah he used to shed defenders and go for those ""whoa"" catches. He really just stopped going full speed like he used to."

Saints,2yozym,Wadzilla2000,3,Wed Mar 11 17:31:13 2015 UTC,I never entertained the thought of pickin a receiver in the first. I just assumed we would go defense with those first two picks.
Saints,2yozym,aimerj,6,Wed Mar 11 18:13:29 2015 UTC,Me either until we lost our No. 1 weapon. Receiver could be a very high value BPA pick. Could you imagine if White dropped to us? Three receivers running sub 4.4 and one of them being 6'3?
Saints,2yozym,I_Like_The_Seahawks,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"I like that idea, but even though we lost such a good offensive weapon I feel like we have more than enough options for Brees to throw to. I'd still like to see us get one of the top 4 edge rushers then if we feel like we need another weapon, pick up someone like Sammie Coates at 31  I'm hoping we get Williams or Browner so that we have more flexibility come draft day. Without either of em signing, I'd still like to maybe see Waynes at 13 or Peters/Collins at 31  Either way tho, I agree with your reasons. It stings a bit but this could work out well for us"
Saints,2yozym,I_Like_The_Seahawks,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"I look at it this way. With the 13th pick, we can get the 13th best player regardless of position outside of safety. Really the 11th best player since Winston is a lock to go ahead of us, and Mariota is about a 90% lock. That leaves one of the 4 best edge rushers, 3 best WR, 3 best tackles, 2 best DT, and best CB available to us. If the 4 best pass rushers are drafted ahead of us, it means we have a better shot at the other positions."
Saints,2yozym,whiskeynrye,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, I do like having 3 of the top 45 picks now. I guess that in itself gives us the opportunity to just go best available at 13, and worry about other positions at 31 and in the second"
Saints,2yozym,Saints4Life_,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:29:09 2015 UTC,It gives us a lot of flexibility. I'm actually not opposed to trading the 13th pick if need be if there isn't a game-changing type player available. We've done the super star thing and it got us to 7-9. Let's try the Patriots thing and build depth around the stars we already have.
Saints,2yozym,whiskeynrye,2,Wed Mar 11 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"Like the trade  Think Jimmy came back too soon in 2014 because Josh Hill was showing him out He is a good kid but doesn't deserve the contract because he is not playing at the same level.  He can be denied and I wouldn't say that about Dez or Gronk.  Unger has huge upside and will be an asset.  Like the trade Not as crazy about letting Lofton go because he ran the interior of the defense even if he struggled in coverage and was very dependable.  Hopefully, they find an ILB who can QB the defensive interior"

Saints,2yozym,djmcintyre,2,Thu Mar 12 14:29:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was a ""winner,"" I think this was much more of a ""win-win"" for both teams. We got rid of a guy we basically weren't using (he played like a third of the games last year) and who had a high cap hit for a TRUE red zone and receiving threat - something we've desperately needed for a long time. There's no way we could get a guy who can make such an impact as Graham with our #31 and we do well in the middle of the draft with the 4th rounder we got.  There's also a MASSIVE graded skill gap between the top #15 and the #16-32. There is little difference in the grades of the the end of the first and the middle/end of the second. So the first rounder isn't as valuable as it has been in previous years.  Now, all that said, lets go through some of your points for fun and explain why the Seahawks got the better of the deal ;-)   He hasn't played at all-pro level for a few years and has been battling injuries. IF he's healthy and IF he plays the best game he's capable of, he will be great, but it's by no means assured he'll manage to do that. It's a gamble, you'll be assuming some amount of risk and if it works out in your favor great, if it doesn't, you might get burned. See our crappy deal with Harvin a few years back... It doesn't actually clear much of any cap space. I think I read he actually costs cap space next year and looking ahead to 2016/2017 doesn't really do much for you guys because you are all known for restructuring contracts. You also have to pick up the added costs for a first rounder, which is not an insignificant cost.    Brees was pretty damn good before Graham was there, and it's not like his targets suck now.   This is VERY true and why I assume you guys felt comfortable doing all this."
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:24:22 2015 UTC,"In No. 1, who is ""he"" Unger or Graham?  In No. 2, 9M in 2016 and 10M in 2017 is very little?"
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,4,Wed Mar 11 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"Oh Unger, the fact that he hasn't been a consistent starter for us has been a real issue. We were onto our 3rd string center at some point and it really hurt us.  Re #2, Certainly trading him off saves you some money. However, I always kind of assume that when you guys get in trouble you would just restructure the contract and push the cap hit down the line (and keep doing this until Brees retires). You all do that better than almost anyone else IMO. My point was more that actually hurting the cap this year is a fairly big deal."
Saints,2yozym,neovenator250,0,Wed Mar 11 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"2.5m in a cap hit isn't a bit deal, also why are people assuming Graham will have the same production when someone not named Drew Brees is throwing him the ball. Did Wilson become an elite passing threat overnight or something?   Unger has allowed 5 sacks in 4 seasons, that's way more useful to this team than a whiny TE that wants to be a WR and doesn't block. You'll see first hand just how much of a baby Graham can be when he realizes you wont pay him his WR money."
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,2,Wed Mar 11 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"also why are people assuming Graham will have the same production when someone not named Drew Brees is throwing him the ball. Did Wilson become an elite passing threat overnight or something?    Dude did you watch any Saints games? Graham is a match up nightmare. Literally all you have to do is throw the ball up and there's an 80% chance Graham will come down with it. He's 6' 7"", there probably 2 or 3 guys in the whole league that can actually guard him.  And, Yes Wilson is an elite passing threat. If you watched any Seahawks games you'd notice he's a lot like Brees in the pocket. He'll definitely be one of the best QBs in the league after a few years."
Saints,2yozym,whiskeynrye,0,Thu Mar 12 17:45:33 2015 UTC,"If you watched any saints games, especially the important ones, you'd know that It was very easy to take Graham out of his game by bumping him. Also since he did 0 blocking it was so easy to see when the saints were running a passing or running play just by seeing where jimmy lined up.  Not sure if you realize that Wilson can't stay in the pocket when the hawks have no offensive line anymore.  Lastly, for someone who has the name Saints4Life you seem to be lacking a flair the the saints subreddit, kind of odd."
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:56:52 2015 UTC,"you'd know that It was very easy to take Graham out of his game by bumping him.   Lol Graham gets pressed almost every time he lines up as a WR and yet he still one of the best TEs in the league. Pressing Graham does nothing, there's no CB in the NFL that can overpower Graham. The only reason Graham disappeared the last three games of the season was because he had a CB and FS/SS on him majority of the time. Even when he was double teamed Brees would still throw the ball up for him, because he knows there's a good chance he'll come down with the ball.  Now as far as Seattle's OL, I have no idea who they lost besides Unger. So you could be right there, but Wilson has no problems throwing outside the pocket.  Some people like flair others don't, it's my choice. Why does that matter? I think my name speaks for itself, I don't need a flair to represent my team, but lets not turn this into an 'Office Space' debate lol.  Edit: Going to be busy for a couple hours so, if you respond, I'll reply when I get the chance."
Saints,2yozym,Saints4Life_,3,Thu Mar 12 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"lol, so many things wrong with this:   why are people assuming Graham will have the same production when someone not named Drew Brees is throwing him the ball.   Because what makes him great is his size and strength. As long as Wilson can throw a ball within his armspan, he's going to get the ball; that's how he was used in NO and that's how we'll use him. Here's the more important question, what separates Brees from Wilson such that will make it that Wilson can't utilize Graham in the same way?    Did Wilson become an elite passing threat overnight or something?   Wilson has the ability to create time for guys to get open and has one of the best deep balls in the league. He's also one of the best QBs by objective statistical measurements in the NFL. The only reason he doesn't get brought up as ""elite"" by people who don't watch him is that he doesn't put up Luck/Brees-esque volume numbers.   Ps. when comparing whether Brees vs Wilson: In 2014 their passer rating differed by 2 points (95 vs 97), in 2013, it was 3 points (101 vs 104), in 2012 Wilson was higher by 4 (100 vs 96). And again, this doesn't include the fact that Wilson is a top 3 rushing QB every year (and #16 rusher OVERALL last year). The Seahawks were also the #5 offense according to DVOA last year. Wilson's also done all this with a bunch of receivers that everyone in the country agrees aren't that good (remember, our #1 receiver this year was our #4 receiver last year).  So while Graham may put up worse volume numbers here in Seattle, there is no statistical evidence to suggest that he will drop off in terms of quality of a player.   Unger has allowed 5 sacks in 4 seasons, that's way more useful to this team than...   Which is super impressive. However, if he played more than half the snaps, it would seem way more impressive. My point isn't to disparage Unger, but to note that he's not been able to be a consistent starter for our team. A guy who is one of the highest paid centers who doesn't actually play is not at all useful (to the Seahawks)   You'll see first hand just how much of a baby Graham can be when he realizes you wont pay him his WR money.   In 3 years, maybe... But for now he's under contract and, like all rational people, he gets that. Maybe the Saints would have had suck a fucking problem with him if they just paid him a few extra million dollars. No wonder he wanted to get the fuck out of there, everyone in the Saints FO were complete dicks to him. I remember this debacle and it's no surprise Graham's relationship soured with the Saints... Edit: Let me just put this less harshly. He was only ""whiny"" because he's designated as a TE but performs the role of a WR and was annoyed to be given the franchise tag at all, let alone for an amount several million dollars less than he felt his job on the team entailed.  Again though, I'm not trying to say the Hawks ""won"" I just think both teams got what they wanted out of the trade and that it was a win-win."
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,0,Wed Mar 11 22:12:30 2015 UTC,"he's designated as a TE but performs the role of a WR and was annoyed to be given the franchise tag at all, let alone for an amount several million dollars less than he felt his job on the team entailed.

Saints,2yozym,Saints4Life_,2,Thu Mar 12 02:27:09 2015 UTC,"And when we renegotiate his contract in 3 years, assuming he lives up to expectations, we may well give him that pay increase.

It would help the short-term memory fans to remember what these two are capable of."
Saints,2yozym,swamptech,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:10:14 2015 UTC,100% agree. The only thing I'm worried about is red zone production might plummet because Graham was freaky good at catching passes in the end zone. Brees TD totals skyrocketed starting in 2011 when Graham became the full-time starter.
Saints,2yozym,oballistikz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:13:41 2015 UTC,"Not to mention you give a heavily back loaded contract to a team that has about 9 big name free agents the seahawks have to sign next year or lose.

This doesnt sound like much but according to spotrac.  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/seattle-seahawks/cap/2016/!

Saints,2yozym,bewareoftraps,2,Wed Mar 11 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"It doesnt look bad but then you notice that the seahawks haven't signed Russel Wilson, Russel Okung, Bobby wagner, Bruce Irvin, and Brandon mebane to their roster for next season yet it gets alot tighter than it used to be with jimmy taking up 4th highest for this year and the 3rd for next. The saints limited the seahwaks growth by giving them graham while the saints got one of the best centers in football to guard brees for a lot less than we were paying graham to put training wheels on the offense."
Saints,2yozym,maloner,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"The addition of Unger can help our O-line make it back to one of the elite o-line's of the NFL.  Our interior lineman can arguably be best in the league, atleast top 5. Could still use some help at OT but the fact of the matter is, when we were consistently good, and when Brees was breaking records all over the place, we had one of, if not THE best O-line in the league. I think that this is pretty smart cuz even if we lose a big weapon like Graham, we have seen what Brees can do with time, and it's not like he used Graham WAAAAY more than all the other receivers. He is a QB who is really good at not relying on a single receiver too much. Plus this obviously helps out Ingram a bunch.  We still have Stills, Cooks, Colston, Josh Hill, Watson, Meachem, Nick Toon. I think we will be okay"
Saints,2yozym,tygerbrees,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:51:33 2015 UTC,I agree with a lot of your points. But how do you see under transitioning to your blocking scheme. At the same time you guys pass more the Seahawks aren't exactly known for pass blocking.

Even putting aside the fact that you're more likely to get a bust than an all star when dealing with QBs drafted in the first round, a QB (no matter how talented and intelligent) needs time to learn, adapt, and ""grow into"" a NFL team's system and style. Drafting a number 1 QB ""prospect"" and then putting him on the field and saying ""ok now do football and save us"" is never the answer."

Saints,2yofut,akc121783,17,Wed Mar 11 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"I just don't see the truth behind these rumors.  Why would Tampa of all teams want to take on Brees and his huge contract to pass up on drafting a potential young/cheaper franchise QB when they are by all means in the process of rebuilding?  It just doesn't make sense.  Also, you don't trade him to someone in our division so we can regret the trade twice a year when he lights up our terrible defense.  And personally I'm not sold on Winston, so I don't think it would be worth it to make the trade."
Saints,2yofut,hubristichumor,5,Wed Mar 11 15:13:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. I really would think Tampa wouldn't be trying to rebuild that fast. Add in Brees they still aren't a SB caliber team. It doesn't make sense to trade 2 years of Brees for at least 10 of Winston/Mariota.
Saints,2yofut,Where_is_Wallace,6,Wed Mar 11 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"As a Saints fan living in Tampa and holding season tickets here. I can't see why the Bucs would do this. My Saints fandom doesn't want to see Brees as anything but a Saint. As a Bucs season ticket holder looking to gain any type of equity I can for my tickets, I don't know if I want Brees here, it will make my tickets desirable for a moment, but I think it's still the same at the end of the year. I'm trying to beg people to take them and hope business associates aren't insulted when I offer them up. Same thing with Winston/Mariota only maybe they build value, or become a star, Brees is big contract who still a great QB but is going into the end of his career, why would Bucs do that?

I don't cheer for the Bucs, the only thing I hope is they at least put out a decent product so the tickets have marketing value to me.   I actually only attend the Saints games every year(on my own tickets), I cheer for the Saints so much in the middle of the club section, I was thrown out of the 2011 game for being unruly after Mark Ingram scored to make it a 3 point game in the 4th. I almost lost my tickets over that, the formal complaints against me by fellow fans were mostly that I rooted too loudly for the Saints, and I may have also said some dirty words."

Saints,2yr2xc,ImShadier,3,Thu Mar 12 03:19:38 2015 UTC,A late round pick is not going to have the same skill set as Spiller. Did you not see the 40 times of the running backs?

Saints,2yr2xc,ImShadier,2,Thu Mar 12 03:36:03 2015 UTC,"Only 3 players ran a sub 4.5.   This is the closest to a scat back in the draft, but most people say his only value is as a punt returner. http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/trey-williams?id=2552649"
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:34:26 2015 UTC,Now that's the kind of guy I'm talking about.    It really just comes down to spending and being safe or saving and taking a gamble.  I don't feel like the position is critical enough to our offensive success on this team we're building to warrant the cost.
Saints,2yr2xc,ImShadier,2,Thu Mar 12 03:37:30 2015 UTC,I do. Brees didn't have a major piece in his arsenal that he had with Bush and Sproles. Both Bush and Sproles were masters at chipping blitzers and having the elite speed to get a couple steps open in the flat and turn it into a gain. Most of their catches were not on designed passes.   This year did you notice a large number of times Brees threw passes to a RB's feet when under pressure?
Saints,2yr2xc,ImShadier,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:43:28 2015 UTC,Good point.  Though I am optimistic about our run game keeping us in more 3rd and short situations which would minimize the impact of not having a top guy at that position.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm researching it a bit, Dee Hart out of Colorado State looks like a potentially promising option too."
Saints,2yr2xc,ImShadier,2,Thu Mar 12 04:31:15 2015 UTC,He caught 20 passes in three season.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:32:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, he went 18-189-2 receiving this past year. Also, did not =/= can not. He's got the base skill set to fill the role."
Saints,2yr2xc,moralesupport,2,Thu Mar 12 04:37:41 2015 UTC,"True, gun to head I haven't seen a Colorado State game in my life, so I'm not the best judge of whether or not he can fit the role."
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 04:40:04 2015 UTC,I remember Dee Hart from when he played at Alabama. He could never get over the injury bug. I believe he tore both ACLs. That's a lot of baggage to bring to the NFL.
Saints,2yr2xc,moralesupport,2,Thu Mar 12 05:57:54 2015 UTC,How much would you feel comfortable paying him though? I like him but I think he's going to ask for more than we should pay.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 03:41:25 2015 UTC,I'd love to know what our cap figure is so I could answer that.   I still see Loomis signing people with roster bonuses so they can stay under the cap and have an escalation that hits in 2016 when we have cap space.
Saints,2yr2xc,moralesupport,2,Thu Mar 12 03:48:56 2015 UTC,That's true. I just don't feel comfortable spending > 3m on spiller.  I guess it depends on what Reggie is asking for too.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,4,Thu Mar 12 03:50:53 2015 UTC,"What ever we spend on Reggie is a waste. He's on the wrong side of 30, has played 9 years and was absolutely terrible last season. When have you seen a RB turn it around in their 10th season?"
Saints,2yr2xc,moralesupport,2,Thu Mar 12 03:54:23 2015 UTC,I mean that contracts are based on what others get. Reggie is the most similar RB to him this FA.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 03:58:45 2015 UTC,Reggie is on the death throws of his career and isn't worth any contract.
Saints,2yr2xc,Lokipokie504,2,Thu Mar 12 04:00:40 2015 UTC,He's visiting the 49ers and if they sign him his contract would impact what we offer.  That's all I meant.  Wasn't talking about us signing him or if he was good.
Saints,2yr2xc,IHaveNoFiya,2,Thu Mar 12 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"ah, gotcha"
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 04:04:45 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I'd rather him over Bush for sure. He's been seriously underutilized in Buffalo, and I think his skill set is perfect for our offense."
Saints,2yr2xc,haledann,3,Thu Mar 12 03:19:40 2015 UTC,How has no one mentioned the fact that we should take Pierre back before we consider this guy?
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,2,Thu Mar 12 04:13:06 2015 UTC,because they provide different things to the offense and Spiller is three years younger.
Saints,2yr2xc,djmcintyre,5,Thu Mar 12 04:21:02 2015 UTC,I dislike this move. we need to be focusing on wr's and our defense not on an over priced reggie bush.
Saints,2yr2xc,Saints2Death,7,Thu Mar 12 03:51:07 2015 UTC,"Colston, Still and Cooks are pretty good, and we won a Super Bowl with a Reggie Bush type running back, not with a Jimmy Graham type TE."
Saints,2yr2xc,djmcintyre,2,Thu Mar 12 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"Well we did have Shockey who was still a good receiving TE. Not Jimmy level but he wasn't bad.   I do like the prospect of getting a scat back, similar to Bush or Sproles but I kinda thought we would pick up a Duke Johnson or something in the 5th  I'm more concerned about the contract that would come with CJ, he's a great player and all, I just hope if we land him, he's not overpayed"
Saints,2yr2xc,ikel123,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:48:32 2015 UTC,He was a good receiving TE in New Orleans? Define good.  http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/ShocJe00.htm

Saints,2yq4w1,Saints2Death,3,Wed Mar 11 22:09:37 2015 UTC,We aren't in the market for a young RB who wants carries. We want someone to play a support role as the flexback. Bush knows the system. We don't need either but I'm taking the cheap option.
Saints,2yq4w1,flordeliest,2,Wed Mar 11 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"We want someone to play a support role as the flexback.    That is exactly what Spiller is.   Bush knows the system.    He hasn't been with the Saints since 2010. And not to many he was terrible last year. Running backs over 30 don't typically get better.   We don't need either but I'm taking the cheap option.   We just traded our best option and have saved a ton of cap on the 2016 season getting out of Lofton's and Graham's contract. We don't need cheap options, we need good options. An over the hill running back is not a good option. Bush would be terrible outside of nostalgia."

Saints,2ypsel,sophandros,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:43:21 2015 UTC,I could definitely see this. He would fit in the Shockey role pretty well. Not quite JG in the pass game but a better blocker

Saints,2ysvdy,ESPNnut,3,Thu Mar 12 15:21:06 2015 UTC,"Good article. However...   Unger seems to be getting a lot of hate from fans, unintentionally.   Really? Because I'm not hearing any of this from fans, maybe I'm just around different fans. Unger is by far one of the best centers out there. Maybe it's because the position is not a glamorous as a tight end, but it is exponentially more important. People who are complaining are probably the causal fans who only focus on the playmakers and not the ones in the trenches. I wouldn't pay much attention to people who don't know how important a center is."
Saints,2ysvdy,baconlovr,2,Thu Mar 12 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I put that in there as a flaw on my part, and kind of how I viewed Unger at first. I came home that day after the trade not knowing anything about Unger and already bashing him because the Saints traded Graham for a center. I guess this wasn't the typical viewpoint from fans who have a lot of football knowledge.   I think your comment, ""Maybe it's because the position is not a glamorous as a tight end,"" is exactly why people aren't appreciating getting Unger, yet."
Saints,2ysvdy,african_violent,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"My fear is both Graham and Unger are apparently injury prone. If Graham gets injured, it's got to have less of an impact for the Seahawks now than if Unger gets injured for us. Do we have a back up center plan?"
Saints,2ysvdy,Compromissionary,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I'm actually really psyched about Unger joining the team.  Our run game has suffered as a result of our mediocre offensive line, and this addition will definitely give us more options than ""Brees throw far."""

I agree Unger will be a great addition to the team if he is able to stay healthy. What are your thoughts about the Drew Brees to Tampa Bay rumors? They seem pretty ridiculous to me, but I thought the Jimmy trade was too. Also do you think Lewis is justified in demanding more job security?"
Saints,2yorby,sophandros,3,Wed Mar 11 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between a rumor and rampant speculation/wishful thinking. The former has some sort of basis in truth, while the latter is pulled out of some idiot's ass.  The Brees to Tampa/Buffalo talk is the latter."

There's good players here. Sammie Coates, DGB an several others 4) ILB at 45 (hopefully perryman)  That's my ideal situation here but I mean I'm no head office guru.

Saints,2yoqs8,cajungator3,2,Thu Mar 12 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be alright at TE without Graham. Obviously it hurts to lose a star like Jimmy, but Hill has done pretty well as a receiving TE, Watson is an experienced leader and competent backup, and we have Orson Charles who is sort of a David Thomas versatile types that can catch and block as a TE and also play FB.  I wouldn't be all that upset if we go after Maxx Williams with #31, but I'd rather add to the defense in the 1st, especially since this puts us in position to possibly land a top front 7 guy at #13 and take a top CB or LB at #31, or package another pick with #31 to move up to the middle of the 1st."

Saints,2yo3qt,Where_is_Wallace,2,Wed Mar 11 14:43:17 2015 UTC,I know he was stellar with the Seahawks. And I also know he had the best safeties in the game backing him up.   How did he do in NE without Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor?
Saints,2yo3qt,didntevenwarmupdho,2,Wed Mar 11 17:11:17 2015 UTC,I'm gonna get hated on for this but I don't think he will be a good addition. He is slow and because of that draws a lot of pass interference penalties. I think playing opposite Revis/McCourty and Sherman/Thomas made him look a lot better than he is.
Saints,2yo3qt,Where_is_Wallace,6,Wed Mar 11 15:35:56 2015 UTC,"And in NOLA he'll be opposite Byrd and Lewis, so he'll look good. And he'll bring the wood."

Saints,2yo3qt,VegasSaint9,3,Wed Mar 11 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, He did make some good plays though, but it's hard when you're lined up 30+ yards away and they keep passing under you."
Saints,2yo3qt,VegasSaint9,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:03:21 2015 UTC,Scheme appeared to be an issue last year as well. trouble started with lack of pass rush and lack of a second cover corner. Byrd was out of position in most instances. Thats why we got picked apart because we played so far off. I think if we use the man scheme like in '13 with a good 2nd corner he will play exponentially better.
Saints,2yo3qt,Lokipokie504,2,Wed Mar 11 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"Give him time, nothing on that team looked right last year except the running game at times and run blocking. Drew was good, but was very un-clutch."

The real ones will hang around for the rebuilding years keeping up with everything like normal. The brees-era fans will come back once we find our franchise QB, if we find our franchise QB, and the asinine bullshit will kick back up.   Jimmy getting traded was a sign we're going to run the ball which is what I've been hoping for. I loved this trade the moment I saw it.

Saints,2ylevn,stonecoldgrits,43,Wed Mar 11 01:26:16 2015 UTC,"You guys are failing to see the big picture here.  Not only was Max Unger a Pro Bowler, he was also an Oregon Duck.  We can probably get all of the Eagles draft picks for him."
Saints,2ylevn,Byle,6,Tue Mar 10 23:56:24 2015 UTC,First Team All-Pro in 2012 aswell
Saints,2ylevn,guga31bb,11,Wed Mar 11 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"That was also the last time he played a full season. The trade is pretty risky for both teams - both players are health question marks. Unger is a good dude though, you'll all like him."

For that not to come true, I'm glad its like this rather than a serious injury or him retiring or something. (Didn't he say he was going to reture when Brees retires once?)  At least now I can admire him without also fearing him.  Also our goal posts are safe."
Saints,2ylevn,apawcolypsemeow,2,Tue Mar 10 23:56:57 2015 UTC,"For a few years there, pundits would compare Russell Wilson to Brees. Though, I wouldn't say Russ is the same caliber of passer, yet."

Saints,2ylevn,ttnorac,6,Wed Mar 11 05:39:30 2015 UTC,I was hurt when Lofton and PT were gone.  I was ALMOST able to rationalize losing them and Graham.  Then you had to put that picture up....WHY!?!?

Yes let's not just judge the trade from a player/player pick/pick basis. Let's completely speculate on a coach's career for no other reason than he traded a big player.

Saints,2yldl4,bernardrfrederic,84,Tue Mar 10 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ what is going on....  Breath deep, Breath deep.   Graham is incredibly overpaid and Unger is one of the top centers in the NFL and addresses the biggest need on the line. This frees up a lot of space for a splash free agent signing and we can get 80% of Grahams production for half the price.   Also White, Cooper or Parker will be available at No. 13 or Maxx Williams could be available at No. 31.  That's all I got man. I'm in shock."
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,19,Tue Mar 10 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you so much.  Center was a big disappointment and was a true cause of a lot of our turnovers last year.  Drew needs to be able to set up in the pocket, which is also why I think the deep ball was missing so much last year.  Plus Graham would disappear during games, and usually would play hurt, but was noticeable.  I think this move, as well as cutting PT and Cadet, are a move to a run first offense, or play action, with Brees having enough time to do his thing, with a blocking TE."
Saints,2yldl4,Random452,12,Tue Mar 10 20:10:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know about a change to a running first offense, but this definitely means we're about to see a gigantic change. We didn't have a great pass catching TE when we won a Super Bowl. We had a crippled Shockey."
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,4,Tue Mar 10 20:13:34 2015 UTC,What about Unger's injury history?
Saints,2yldl4,whodat951,6,Tue Mar 10 20:22:53 2015 UTC,Missed 13 games over the last 2 seasons. Only played 6 games in 2014. Ankle was the issue in 2014. Knee I think in 2013.
Saints,2yldl4,Chez_Moose,5,Tue Mar 10 21:33:46 2015 UTC,....awesome.
Saints,2yldl4,whodat951,2,Tue Mar 10 21:39:31 2015 UTC,"Seems to me this is a classic ""rebuild"" type move. 1st day draft pick and a lot of salary off the books for a decent OL with maybe a couple decent years left in some injured legs. Not what you want to see as a fan of a team that still has Drew Brees, but maybe the more pragmatic move."
Saints,2yldl4,Chez_Moose,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:51:18 2015 UTC,wow FML
Saints,2yldl4,trees4mybeard,9,Tue Mar 10 22:00:12 2015 UTC,I don't know man. Players get hurt. Every year Graham is battling either an ankle or a shoulder injury. I'm not saying this was a great trade. I'm trying to rationalize it the best I can.
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,2,Tue Mar 10 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"Maxx Williams should be there at 31 and I'd love to have him. I was hoping he might somehow be there for us in the second (even before the Graham trade), but that's unlikely.  He's not the playmaker Graham is, but he's a solid, young, do-it-all TE. He's a good pass catcher, can run over defenders, and was a great blocker for Minnesota's run game. He and RB David Cobb were basically that offense's only weapons. I really like Cobb too, in fact, and was hoping we'd take him in the mid rounds if Ingram left."
Saints,2yldl4,InappropriateHandle,25,Tue Mar 10 20:45:17 2015 UTC,I'm sad about losing Unger. He's the perfect center for you guys though. Especially now that Ingram shows he can be a feature back. He'd fit like a glove in your scheme.
Saints,2yldl4,BigFishMcNish,2,Tue Mar 10 20:07:16 2015 UTC,He's also a great person and locker room leader and he makes everyone on the O-line better.
Saints,2yldl4,Colin_Kaepnodick,95,Tue Mar 10 23:12:25 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with this. Yeah losing Jimmy sucks, but we're getting one of the best Centers right now and another 1st draft pick. I think we'll be okay without Jimmy. He disappeared a lot in games where we needed him."
Saints,2yldl4,Zakimus,25,Tue Mar 10 19:59:03 2015 UTC,Yeah honestly with our other TE's performance I think our offense is gonna work just fine. Really need to protect Brees more than anything.
Saints,2yldl4,cheetah_kibbles,16,Tue Mar 10 20:02:01 2015 UTC,Protected Brees = Superbowl level passing
Saints,2yldl4,ttnorac,13,Tue Mar 10 20:40:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. Hill looked great in the pass plays he was in. Plus we could be making a move for Gresham or J Cameron.
Saints,2yldl4,Zakimus,8,Tue Mar 10 20:03:49 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Jimmy don't block, and with all the drops he's had, I'd rather have Hill, Watson, or some future TE in there. Remember Colston was a ""nobody"" prior to coming to the Saints. Protect our elite QB, and he'll make elite receivers of whoever he's throwing to."
Saints,2yldl4,B504,48,Tue Mar 10 20:46:57 2015 UTC,"You guys are going to love Unger. It is really, really hard to swallow losing him.  Also, hope you guys do well with the 1st round pick. It's only ever worked for us once in the past decade with Earl.  We always seem to do better in later rounds."
Saints,2yldl4,Hotdog_Skin,11,Tue Mar 10 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing how he's really injury prone. Were they freak accidents? Or is it a trend? If he can stay healthy, I'm ok with this trade. I just worry we traded away our top recieving threat for a guy that'll end up on IR in week 3"
Saints,2yldl4,Hotdog_Skin,13,Tue Mar 10 20:29:23 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't say he's any more injury-prone than Jimmy.  Just had some issues below the knees with ankle sprains and 'foot injury' but it doesn't seem like he's overly prone to tearing an ACL or anything like that.  I hope he produces well for you guys, especially since you lost a huge playmaker for him."
Saints,2yldl4,guga31bb,7,Tue Mar 10 21:08:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, bud. Enjoy Jimmy :("
Saints,2yldl4,cheetah_kibbles,6,Tue Mar 10 21:14:27 2015 UTC,For sure. And thanks...now I'm just hoping we can patch together an o-line so Russell gets the opportunity to pass to him lol.
Saints,2yldl4,cacksman,11,Tue Mar 10 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"He missed 4 games with a ""foot injury"" (I don't think more specifics were released), came back for a few games, and then suffered a high ankle sprain, causing him to miss 6 more games. Honestly it's hard to know if they're two fluke incidents or if he's injury prone."
Saints,2yldl4,IAMARomanGodAMA,7,Tue Mar 10 20:42:42 2015 UTC,Its a risk on both sides. Jimmy has been injured too there's really no telling how it's gonna play out. I hope the off season is enough time for Unger to get healthy. Oh and to answer your question it's been his ankle. It was an ankle sprain but it was lingering and has affected him for quite a bit of time.
Saints,2yldl4,JonWalshAmericasMost,4,Tue Mar 10 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"He's very injury prone. Missed 13 games in the last 2 years. When healthy, he is a difference maker though. Add a 1st round pick, and NO gets a good haul.  Seattle gets a true mismatch maker they wanted and still gets a mid-round pick in return, while also getting Graham at a lower cap # than expected (3 years, $27M, $7M GTD)"
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,4,Tue Mar 10 20:53:48 2015 UTC,"His high ankle sprain this year was from a roll-up if IIRC. He's had a couple of OLineman-type wear-and-tear injuries, but that ankle sprain that put him out for 6 weeks was a crappy sequence of events."
Saints,2yldl4,Hotdog_Skin,2,Tue Mar 10 23:57:35 2015 UTC,He has only played 1 season of 16 games since 2009
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:57:24 2015 UTC,Is Graham not injury prone?
Saints,2yldl4,Hotdog_Skin,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:22:55 2015 UTC,Absolutely. At least he can decoy for us when he's hobbled
Saints,2yldl4,Duckerr,2,Tue Mar 10 21:23:38 2015 UTC,I'd still take a broken Unger over a fully healthy Goodwin.
Saints,2yldl4,bamyo,3,Tue Mar 10 21:26:45 2015 UTC,I'd take Carl from ATHF over Goodwin again
Saints,2yldl4,aksoileau,7,Tue Mar 10 21:33:35 2015 UTC,Bruce Irvin was a first round pick as well
Saints,2yldl4,cfiggis,2,Tue Mar 10 20:35:52 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't say he really panned out though, considering he was picked at #15 or so. He's had flashes but never really been a consistent positive contributor."
Saints,2yldl4,WinstontheBT,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that's true. Forgot about Bruce."
Saints,2yldl4,cfiggis,8,Tue Mar 10 21:05:56 2015 UTC,Unger has missed 13 games the past two seasons.  Makes me really nervous.
Saints,2yldl4,mrcelophane,11,Tue Mar 10 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"A first round draft pick that's basically a second round draft pick. Seattle would have been picking 31st, right?"
Saints,2yldl4,WinstontheBT,25,Tue Mar 10 20:09:55 2015 UTC,This is a stupid way to look at it. Having two picks in the top 31 is HUGE
Saints,2yldl4,cfiggis,10,Tue Mar 10 20:12:25 2015 UTC,"There's a significant difference between who's available at 13 and who's available at 31.  I mean, 31 is still going to be a good player, but we're giving up Jimmy Graham."
Saints,2yldl4,Zakimus,8,Tue Mar 10 20:26:49 2015 UTC,We got a great Center too.
Saints,2yldl4,cfiggis,3,Tue Mar 10 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"We had no cap room, Jimmy was not performing to his contract, and we got a 1st round pick and one of the best centers in the league(a position we have struggled with). Jimmy Graham was picked in the second round, who says we can't get a great player at 31? There are 256 picks, we now have 2 picks in the top 12% of the draft. To blow off a first round pick, like you're doing, is asinine."
Saints,2yldl4,johall,10,Tue Mar 10 20:34:34 2015 UTC,I'm not blowing off the first round pick. I'm just valuing it less than I'd value our own first round pick. And I'm valuing Jimmy Graham higher than you. No reason to call it asinine. Let's keep it civil.
Saints,2yldl4,mystikalghost,2,Tue Mar 10 20:45:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. which it's funny, When people talk about the 1st pick of the 2nd round, it's ""basically a first round pick"" however on the flip, it's ""basically a second round pick"" It's 31st overall. So we'll have 13 and 31 to pick at."
Saints,2yldl4,unlisted_user,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thinking of them in ""rounds"" is bound to either over-value or under-value any pick. Better to look at the exact pick position."
Saints,2yldl4,mystikalghost,2,Tue Mar 10 20:54:09 2015 UTC,"I think I'm with you on this. We need consistency more than highlight reels and Jimmy lately was 100% the latter.   After the playoff game against San Fran where he and Gronk were battling for the record in different games, he just had not been worth the money we were giving him."

Saints,2yldl4,asmodeus01,2,Tue Mar 10 20:38:59 2015 UTC,I don't like this either. We traded Unger to you guys for Graham. Unger is our anchor for the run game.
Saints,2yldl4,Saints2Death,40,Tue Mar 10 20:32:43 2015 UTC,"Pierre, Lofton, and now Graham. I know we had cap issues but fuck this offseason."
Saints,2yldl4,asmodeus01,8,Tue Mar 10 19:53:05 2015 UTC,Graham only saves 4 mil?? What do we need cap for if we aren't going to get big names.
Saints,2yldl4,hibbert0604,26,Tue Mar 10 20:14:21 2015 UTC,2.5M loss this season (edited per Woodbery's tweet below thanks to /u/Saints2Death) 4.5 next season 8 mil in 2017 Trade a 4th for a 1st Gain a Pro Bowl C    We won this trade
Saints,2yldl4,DiNovi,3,Tue Mar 10 20:41:57 2015 UTC,4.5 next season? Try $9M in 2016 and $10M in 2017 unless I'm missing something.
Saints,2yldl4,hibbert0604,7,Tue Mar 10 21:25:32 2015 UTC,I subtracted Unger's pay and guaranteed money.
Saints,2yldl4,YesWeCannabis32,2,Tue Mar 10 22:10:30 2015 UTC,Had to happen eventually :)
Saints,2yldl4,cedrich45,7,Tue Mar 10 20:12:22 2015 UTC,"this kind've insures it won't happen, actually."
Saints,2yldl4,OGMoose,15,Tue Mar 10 20:13:51 2015 UTC,It was beneficial to do this now. I agree. Each year it was strung out was going to make it that much more painful. I personally think Graham is an overrated crybaby but I could just be biased. Lol. I think you guys will be fine.

Saints,2yldl4,phargle,18,Tue Mar 10 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we better not waste the pick and Unger better play well, but seriously? 15 mil a season for Graham was too much. He can't stay healthy for 16 games, and won't play well through injuries. Our offense devolved into chucking it to Graham last season. It was good while it lasted. Then he got hurt.   Plus, this trade means we can actually sign players to the offensive line and the defense. He's the best TE, that's true, but do we really want to sacrifice the overall team to have him?"

Saints,2yldl4,trees4mybeard,11,Tue Mar 10 19:57:52 2015 UTC,Seahawks fan here.   It seems to me like we are trading two very competent players each with huge question marks about their ability to make continued success and injuries. Hopefully we all benefit from this one!
Saints,2yldl4,beer_jew,10,Tue Mar 10 21:08:59 2015 UTC,Why won't Seattle leave us aloooooone. :(
Saints,2yldl4,ben630,20,Tue Mar 10 20:06:22 2015 UTC,I LOVE IT. We should have dealt Graham for a first round pick instead of franchise tagging him. We just essentially got TWO first round picks for him. Great fucking trade Loomis! Let's get that run game and pass protection going again baby! WHO DAT!!

Saints,2yldl4,Saints72,7,Tue Mar 10 20:57:18 2015 UTC,How good is Unger? The pick is clearly a waste since Payton has no idea what to do with those things.
Saints,2yldl4,TacoExcellence,6,Tue Mar 10 19:52:23 2015 UTC,He's a Pro Bowl type center when he's healthy but he's injury prone. Saints also get Seattle 1st round pick but also give up a 4th. I think Saints will draft TE Max Williams
Saints,2yldl4,Saints72,8,Tue Mar 10 20:00:14 2015 UTC,"We still have Watson, Charles, and Hill. Hill has been pretty solid for us lately, and Charles is the type of TE/FB that makes a good #2, and Watson is the veteran leader."

Saints,2yldl4,wyschnei,7,Tue Mar 10 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"Our drafting history in general is pretty shit, but our first rounders are a total crap shoot. In any case, if he thought for a second Graham would have been as good as he is, he wouldn't have risked taking him in the 3rd."

Saints,2yldl4,Williamis1,8,Tue Mar 10 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Ok... so maybe this isn't as bad as it seems... Unger is a probowl caliber center.   Maybe this will give Brees more time to throw.    Drew Brees makes recievers. We've seen WRs who were good with us, leave the team, and become mediocre.    Don't get me wrong, Graham is good, really really good, but it's possible that what we need more than a good receiver is a better center to give DB more time to throw."
Saints,2yldl4,sunstersun,3,Tue Mar 10 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"As my roommate always says, you can put a ham sandwich in wide-out with Drew Brees under center and it'll get 80 yards and a touchdown"

Let's be honest, Graham was still good, but he wasn't the player he was two years ago. Not sure what was the problem but he wasn't the same. Also at times Graham (not by choice) hurt the offense because Brees would get so focused on him that he forgot about the rest of the offense.   I do think Graham will flourish in Seattle but this is good for us as well. Top 5 lineman to help block for Brees and give us a better run game. Not to mention we get a second first rounder, which who knows we may trade for something else.   Things can't get much worse than last year so I say we give this a shot and see what happens. An offense is only as good as it's offensive line. Dallas showed us all that fact last year."
Saints,2yldl4,ozarka83,5,Tue Mar 10 20:05:35 2015 UTC,I'm sure we could have found an AFC trade. Trading him to Seattle seems foolish

Saints,2yldl4,QuickLightning,3,Tue Mar 10 20:04:31 2015 UTC,I'm devastated. Especially since the Seahawks always seem to have our number. Jimmy was one of my favorite Saints too. Brees also lost his top red zone target and probably his favorite target in general right up with Colston.

Saints,2yldl4,Smash_Brothers,2,Tue Mar 10 21:26:11 2015 UTC,It's really a weird trade.  I don't understand how it can be seen as a positive from the Saints point of view unless they are planning on Brees retiring and the team entering rebuilding over the next few years.
Saints,2yldl4,ksolomon,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:29:00 2015 UTC,It probably depends on who we draft with that extra pick.  If Payton/Loomis drop the ball on the pick then things will get nasty.
Saints,2yldl4,jvalentine83,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:58:17 2015 UTC,Do they typically do BPA? Or do you guys seeing yourself trade up?
Saints,2yldl4,GoDoobieGo,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:22:14 2015 UTC,Traded up for Mark Ingram a few years ago and Brandin Cooks last year.  Its usually need over BPA from what I can remember recently.

Saints,2yldl4,crawfish2013,4,Tue Mar 10 19:58:47 2015 UTC,WHYYYYYYYYY!!!  Why the hell would you give up a weapon like Jimmy Graham?!
Saints,2yldl4,DarkSquareBishop,3,Tue Mar 10 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"To get a top 3 center in the league + draft picks. Oh and clear up much needed cap space. Jimmy wasn't gonna win a championship by himself. Brees needs protection and we need defensive help, this trade accomplishes both (assuming you use both first rounders on D). Plus, I am not sure if you watched last season, but dude disappeared after getting his big pay day."
Saints,2yldl4,JoeyJihad,2,Tue Mar 10 20:16:01 2015 UTC,I guess they think one superbowl was enough.
Saints,2yldl4,Megawatts19,4,Tue Mar 10 20:07:57 2015 UTC,I think this trade hurts the Saints more than it helps the Seahawks. And by that I mean I do not believe Jimmy Graham will be as great of a receiver in Seattle than he was in New Orleans. Last season proved that the Saints need more than just Jimmy and Drew. It's the smart move in the long run. Just a huge shock. HUGE.
Saints,2yldl4,pagan457,4,Tue Mar 10 20:15:41 2015 UTC,Why to Seattle? Why make their team THAT much better? This blows.

Saints,2yldl4,Spirit0fRadi0,3,Tue Mar 10 20:29:37 2015 UTC,Not going to lie here. I don't mind. Jimmy Graham was great but he became easy to defend against once teams started targeting him. Our best offensive performances come from Brees being able to spread the ball around to many different receivers. Getting a strong center will help Brees maintain a clear pocket allowing us to spread the ball more easily. I believe having no name receivers with a clear pocket for Brees is better than having big name talent receiving while Brees gets hammered.
Saints,2yldl4,WinstontheBT,2,Tue Mar 10 20:23:38 2015 UTC,Ain't that the truth. I don't think the defensive backs of the league realise just how effective Kenny Stills can be. And Cooks is still largely unknown. Even Colston has been underplayed heavily in favour of Jimmy. I'm really excited about this.

Saints,2yn2st,bennibobiboo,21,Wed Mar 11 20:43:11 2015 UTC,"I think this trade can safely be called a win/win.    For us, center was a real weakness, and Jimmy was basically an offensive luxury.  Now we have more resources with which to address the defense both in a little extra cap space and an extra first rounder.  For them, they get a big, talented red-zone threat that they've been lacking, while the guys who backed up Unger last year did a pretty solid job for them.  Also, they've got a decent track record with drafting outside of the first round."
Saints,2yn2st,ImShadier,13,Wed Mar 11 03:57:20 2015 UTC,Hawks fan here. I wanted to see how the Saints fans were reacting and I have to agree with you. It's a BIG win/win for the both of us.  Unger will make your running game better by a lot. Which just makes Brees even more of a threat. Adding the extra time he will have to throw and Saints should easily be back on top in their division.   The Hawks get a tall jump ball player that we haven't had since Rice retired. The O-line problem is less of a problem than people are making it out to be. Wilson loves to scramble and some of his best plays are made when the pocket breaks. If Jimmy can get open when the play breaks down Wilson will find him ever time.  As long as Unger and Jimmy stay healthy this is a great trade for both teams. It may be too early to call but this could be the makings of an insane NFC Championship Game.
Saints,2yn2st,jaron_b,6,Wed Mar 11 11:21:13 2015 UTC,I ran Green Lake with a Saints shirt on yesterday afternoon. I had many people yell Jimmy Graham at me. It was awesome!
Saints,2yn2st,thedumbdown,3,Wed Mar 11 16:05:06 2015 UTC,It's still going to be so weird to see Graham in Seahawks blue. I don't know if I'll be able to stomach it.
Saints,2yn2st,Megawatts19,29,Wed Mar 11 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"We didn't win the trade, but we didn't lose it either. We got what we were looking for, same with Seattle."
Saints,2yn2st,OGMoose,8,Wed Mar 11 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly.  I really tire of people saying x won the trade.  The point of a trade is because both teams feel they get what they want, and thus both sides win the trade."
Saints,2yn2st,rybob1,11,Wed Mar 11 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"As an outsider to both teams, I think this trade makes a ton of sense, especially with their decision to re-sign Ingram. Seems to me the team is trying to move into a more run-dependent offense than in the past, probably a product of the numerous poorly-timed turnovers that the passing offense had (Colston's fumble in OT against the Falcons, Brees' pick against the Lions, etc.). Ingram also showed he could be a featured back in the new zone scheme, and could excel.  Plus in my opinion, I have had a growing disdain for the team trying to bottleneck its passing offense through Graham. I felt like Brees had tunnel vision when Graham was on the field, seemingly not trusting the other receivers to make a play. When I think back to the most dominant offensive years that the Saints have had with Brees, I remember him spreading the ball around much, much more.  When it comes to the actual trade, I think the Seahawks honestly overpaid by including a 1st round pick especially considering Graham's health issues as of late. I think that's where the Saints could make out like bandits with this trade - in this loaded draft, that 31st selection could produce a difference maker on either side of the ball."
Saints,2yn2st,mrhashbrown,3,Wed Mar 11 06:56:04 2015 UTC,"Mostly true. But the most dominate offense we've had was in 2011 when Drew threw 5,500 yards and 46 TDs. Graham had the most catches of his career that season. So I'd say the most dominate the Saints ever were, statistically, was a season where they featured Graham the most."
Saints,2yn2st,quantumhed,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:47:36 2015 UTC,"That is true, but the most balanced offense we had was in 09. The year we ran the ball the most was the year we won the super bowl."

Saints,2yn2st,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:08:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it is safe to say that Brees will spread the ball around regardless.  Having Jimmy can create tunnel vision I'm sure, but I don't think it ever creates a problem for Brees.  Now without Graham, I'm looking forward to seeing Cooks and Stills step up.  Also, I think Colston becomes as sure handed as he has been in the past and sees and uptick in TD's by getting some of the looks Graham normally would have gotten in the Redzone."
Saints,2yn2st,hubristichumor,2,Wed Mar 11 15:35:35 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said 100%
Saints,2yn2st,makeplayz,5,Wed Mar 11 08:24:58 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna go ahead and say it-- I'm totally fine with the trade.  Emotionally, Jimmy was great for us.  We had some great moments with him and he was very good for us overall.  THAT BEING SAID, the guy was fucking lazy.  He also did not show up for big games the last 2 seasons with us. All in all, thanks for the memories, Jimmy.  But personal feelings aside, I'm super content with this trade."
Saints,2yn2st,Mississippster,6,Wed Mar 11 04:47:05 2015 UTC,"He's not the best center in the league, he's a good center who missed 10 games last year due to injury, and someone ELSE was protecting Russell for 10 games they played in 2014 on their way to the Super Bowl.  And you don't get Jimmy Graham to be a blocker, you get him to line him up against a CB or linebacker and destroy slots, or force the other team to overload coverage on him and open it up elsewhere on the field.  I don't see the upside."
Saints,2yn2st,ThreeOneFive,2,Wed Mar 11 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was going to say, y'all are going to be pretty disappointed if you're expecting ""Best center in the league"". As long as he stays healthy he'll give you a great 16 games, unfortunately that's only happened twice in his career. We didn't have our blocking tight end for 3/4 of last year so Graham is obviously going to be a huge step up. I think it's a pretty fair trade for both sides, obviously dependent on how you guys spend #31"
Saints,2yn2st,WSUGrizzHawk,7,Wed Mar 11 18:10:30 2015 UTC,I think the best part about this trade is the fact that Brees wont be forcing throws to Jimmy in double coverage and throwing ints anymore.

Saints,2yn2st,watchout4mikem,3,Wed Mar 11 04:54:44 2015 UTC,To be honest this is a great fit for both teams. Brees can pretty much get solid production out of any player but his downfall this season was having too much pressure on him. Unger will help sure up that line and give Brees more time that he desperately needs. Now russell Wilson has a reliable guy to throw to that can lineup as a wideout or tight end and has good size to make an impact in blocking although it's widely known he's not the best blocker. Plus now you also get a 1st rounder which could be used at the LB position as now I believe yall will draft trae Waynes with the 13.
Saints,2yn2st,agarret83,2,Wed Mar 11 06:20:10 2015 UTC,We addressed a need at center and also a second need with the first round pick. We lost Graham who was over paid before the injuries and dip in production.   As much as I hate it we didn't do that badly on the trade. We definitely didn't win.
Saints,2yn2st,Andy_Gator,2,Wed Mar 11 03:40:13 2015 UTC,"I didn't necessarily want to lose Graham, but I think we addressed some needs while making a long term cap-friendly move. Drew Brees is at his best when he has time to throw and he did not have that last year. Graham was able to be completely taken out of games, most notably when we played NE & Seattle in 2013. I think Graham is a really good TE but I also think Brees made him better. The thing going for him now is that Lynch & Wilson will demand a lot of defensive attention."
Saints,2yn2st,sophandros,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:01:40 2015 UTC,I think we won by a small margin but it still hurts really badly to lose Jimmy
Saints,2yn2st,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:50:22 2015 UTC,"No, I love the trade. I am on cloud nine."
Saints,2yn2st,trees4mybeard,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"Trade a good player and a 4th round pick for a good player and a 1st round pick.  Having two first round picks gives us a lot of versatility, and we no longer have to fill the center position in the draft or FA.  Graham's production doesn't have to be 100% replaced for our offense to be effective, and if we can get someone in the Bush/Sproles mold, we'll be fine."
Saints,2yn2st,smasho1,1 point,Wed Mar 11 06:36:28 2015 UTC,"Both teams won but I think the value of Unger to our offensive line and the devalue of Jimmy being a shit run blocker gives us the advantage on just the player to player part, they're both 28. But we got a pick too. We won this trade. And now I can stop bitching, after 3 seasons, of being a pass heavy offense. For we are finally converting into a run first, play action team to help Brees' geriatric ass. Thank you football gods."
Saints,2yn2st,makeplayz,1 point,Wed Mar 11 08:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yes you are because even if they were unhappy with his performance, COACH HIM UP...don't give him to the team where he's all they need to dominate."
Saints,2yn2st,smasho1,1 point,Wed Mar 11 11:30:28 2015 UTC,I don't think Unger's a great center-- I think his stats are inflated because of Lynch.
Saints,2yn2st,wjray,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"Centers dont get graded by stats, they get graded by their dominance at the LOS and whether or not they're getting to the second level, beating guys off the line and getting leverage. Unger is an upgrade, one of the best centers in the league, same age as Jimmy, and he's now the anchor on our line. Plus we got a first."
Saints,2yn2st,bubbamolls,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:06:33 2015 UTC,"I may be interpreting too much, but I see the trade's logic as this: A stronger center will help our ground game at the same time it improves protection for the drop-snap.  (The overall offense was at its best this season when Ingram was running at his best (like vs. GB)).  This keeps the opp. team honest up front, which helps the passing game... better passing game opens up more space for runs, which helps the pass, etc etc.  I am concerned that a 'star' center isn't going to have that kind of impact for the OL overall, whereas Jimmy's reach and reliability (in years past) made the secondary commit to covering him tight on most every play."
Saints,2yn2st,hawbbes,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"My first reaction to the trade news was stunned silence because it seemed like the cherry on top of the shit sundae that has been my week.  After having a little time to think about it, I think it's going to work out well for the Saints. Don't get me wrong; I'm a JG fan. I had to order his jersey because none were available in stores here. I just changed my flair. But thinking about it more objectively, he's sort of disappeared the past couple of years especially in big games. He's a bit injury prone. Drew did seem to lock in on him when the pocket collapsed.   And the collapsing pocket may have been solved with the trade. Armstead, Evans, Unger, Grubbs, Streif. Based on past performance, that's not a bad O line. Especially if Unger can stay healthy, which is my only concern about him.   Add to that, the Saints picked up another first round pick. Of course, time will tell if that pick is used wisely or not.  The thing that pushed me over the edge, though, was reading (sorry I don't have the link handy) that in the four years before JG came to the Saints, the offense was ranked 1st, 4th, 4th, and 1st. JG didn't make the Saints or Drew. The Saints and Drew made JG."
Saints,2yn2st,batmanisfiya,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"People in NOLA got attached to Graham really fast. And the women LOVE him...but we won a Super Bowl with one legged Jeremy Shockey. Jimmy was good, but he wasn't our entire offense, despite what Chris Collinsworth always wanted you to believe. Plus, Brandin Cooks is sooo good."
Saints,2yn2st,akboy42,1 point,Wed Mar 11 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"We are very glad you think so. Unger is a great player, with a great beard, who will be missed in Seattle.  EDIT: from a Seahawk fan"
Saints,2yn2st,Mudkipz137,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I've been hoping we would get rid of him since before last season with his ""I want wide receiver money"" bullshit. The dude is constantly hurt. But has great hands. As long as nobody is there to contest the pass or breathe on him otherwise it's a drop. Plus the fact that he has no consistency in his play. He always starts lights out and then just falls off by the end of the season. We DEFINITELY got the better end of this trade."
Saints,2yn2st,Dabeston,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:11:37 2015 UTC,So unger was out quite a bit last year for the seahawks we had our back up center in for a while he started like 6 games i believe also unger likes to snap the ball low also JG was out for a while as well.
Saints,2yocf3,Buddy813,23,Wed Mar 11 13:36:35 2015 UTC,Why would we get rid of our top TE for a center if not to protect our bread 'n butter HOF franchise QB?
Saints,2yocf3,african_violent,3,Wed Mar 11 14:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well, it could be to run block for the RB we just signed. But, I think this is all made up speculation. Just playing devils advocate."
Saints,2yocf3,Lokipokie504,2,Wed Mar 11 14:08:31 2015 UTC,This is true; however I just don't see us going as far with just this RB as we would with this particular QB/RB combo. It would be silly.
Saints,2yocf3,african_violent,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:12:20 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree. I was just answering the question you asked. It's certainly a possibility, even if it's a dumb one."
Saints,2yocf3,Lokipokie504,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:22:22 2015 UTC,I appreciate it! :)
Saints,2yocf3,african_violent,10,Wed Mar 11 16:02:12 2015 UTC,From Tampa's perspective this doesn't even make sense.  Even if we traded Drew + our 2 1st rounders for the pick to grab Winston (which would be us getting fleeced).  Tampa has a chance to draft a franchise QB for the future.  And to pay him beans for a few years allowing them to build a team around him (a team that is pretty much good QB play from contending for the division already).  In exchange for this they'd get an aging vet QB that they'd get 3 or so years out of and have to pay the back end of a contract to keep him that even Loomis was terrified of restructuring.  I have a hard time finding a situation where this makes sense for either team.  Especially after the Seattle trade.
Saints,2yocf3,Freshnukix,8,Wed Mar 11 14:10:52 2015 UTC,Agreed - this makes no sense for us.  Although I'd love to see you guys trade Brees somewhere outside the division...
Saints,2yocf3,Invisible_Griffin,4,Wed Mar 11 14:55:41 2015 UTC,"jameis winston will go crazy in nola supermarkets, think of all the crablegs amongst other crustaceans he can steal!   in all seriousness this guy will be a PR nightmare for a team that is unfortunate enough to draft him."
Saints,2yocf3,LSUMiner,6,Wed Mar 11 15:22:06 2015 UTC,I have absolutely 100% no doubt in my mind that these rumors are completely false.
Saints,2yocf3,jwyzzle,8,Wed Mar 11 14:15:14 2015 UTC,"I'll take ""'Things I would have said about trading Jimmy Graham' for 800"""
Saints,2yocf3,Jsizzles93,3,Wed Mar 11 15:47:39 2015 UTC,Graham hasn't been the key instrument in our offense like Brees has. Alot of Grahams success can be credited to Brees. There is no way the Saints will trade their super bowl QB.
Saints,2yocf3,jwyzzle,2,Wed Mar 11 16:04:20 2015 UTC,51 of Brees' TDs had a lot to do with Graham.
Saints,2yocf3,Dj_Nussdog,1 point,Wed Mar 11 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, but the Graham trade still came out of nowhere. I just have a hard time shrugging of the rumors because I would have done the exact same thing with rumors about trading Graham."
Saints,2yocf3,Jsizzles93,2,Wed Mar 11 16:08:50 2015 UTC,Well I agree with that. It was a huge shocker and it's sad to see him go. He is one of my favorite players and to add insult to injury he is going to the Seahawks.
Saints,2yocf3,jwyzzle,5,Wed Mar 11 17:04:35 2015 UTC,Trading him to the bucs would be stupid; we will still have to see him twice a year.  He is still good and plenty of teams would kill to have him.
Saints,2yocf3,LucasJLeCompte,5,Wed Mar 11 13:59:22 2015 UTC,and Tampa has a couple really good receivers I wouldn't want to see Brees twice a year...nope

Saints,2yocf3,theDOC7OR,8,Wed Mar 11 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"If the Saints trade Brees I am done with them. After what he did for the City and what he has meant to the Community, only a selfish garbage organization would trade him away.  That said, I really doubt that they would do this."
Saints,2yocf3,Where_is_Wallace,4,Wed Mar 11 14:27:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately for the team from a business standpoint, Drew Brees has basically immortalized himself with the city. They're kinda damned if they do damned if the don't."
Saints,2yocf3,Jsizzles93,2,Wed Mar 11 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"Well honestly, all they really need is someone else to step in and be the face of the franchise, as long as that happens, and the team wins, fans tend to forget the bad kind of quickly. If they are actually shopping Brees, the thing that is truly unfortunate is that the guy who was arguably the best runner up is now in Seattle."
Saints,2yocf3,Megawatts19,1 point,Wed Mar 11 15:56:50 2015 UTC,Pretty much how I feel about it. It angers me to even think about.
Saints,2yocf3,BootsBean,3,Wed Mar 11 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I can't say I'd give up on the Saints, but it would push me about as close as it could get."

The last ten 10 years the first round has produced these qbs:  Luck, Rg3, Tannehill, Cam, Stafford, Flacco, Ryan, Cutler, Alex Smith, Rodgers, Eli, Rivers, and Big Ben.

Alex smith would actually be pretty good in our system I think. He's good at distributing the ball around and mitigating risk."
