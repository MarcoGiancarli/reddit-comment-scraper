justiceleague,3dqrue,flashfan123,2,Sat Jul 18 15:33:33 2015 UTC,"Justice League Origins [New 52] is a fun read. You get to learn about how the JL meet, and there is no ongoing story arcs. [since the whole book takes place five years in the past] Since you're getting into comics this is a great place to start. The Flash comics [New 52] are good but, I myself did not like vol 1, only at vol 2 did the spices get put in. Batman zero year was also good since Scott Snyder writes it. The good part about the zero year arc is that it takes place in the past so you don't have to know what's going on in order to know what's happening. I also heard the Red Lanterns are good also, as well as GL New Guardians. In conclusion pick up any New 52 title and slowly collect [thats what I do] because most of the vol 1's are like only 10 or so dollars, so you can pick up random comics and experiment for cheap."

When Carter touched the Absorbocron it brought forth his memories of his former life, including how to operate Thanagarian technology.  Hawkman's ""wings"" are made of Nth metal, which has a host of properties including anti-gravity.

Seeing eyeballs makes the character more expressive. It's that basic movie-production myth that Hollywood won't stop doing at the cost of making a better movie.  Like, we know what it looks like when a stuntman is thrown through breakaway glass. We know it doesn't look the same as when a regular person crashes through a window. You might as well not do the stunt if it's going to look fake, or overly-produced."

Although that Batman thing does sound like it's from New World Order, which is JLA 1-4, in which the bad guys lose because they underestimated Batman and he figured out their origin and weakness.

justiceleague,38r4q7,brightreddan,5,Sun Jun 7 00:16:02 2015 UTC,It would have to be someone big enough to justify forming the league and Darkside definitely fits that bill but I think  Brainiac would be a better choice for the first film. Something I'm actually more excited about is getting a big screen Legion of Doom together someday.
justiceleague,38r4q7,Ntayeh,2,Sat Jun 6 03:42:46 2015 UTC,Most likely Darkseid or Brainiac.

justiceleague,380hbr,ryanson209,8,Sun May 31 23:05:50 2015 UTC,"What, you're talkin' about the Squadron Supreme? Those are characters from Marvel's comics. Yeah, they're an evil version of the Justice League, but I dunno that I'd call 'em parody.    But no, the DCAU in general didn't touch Marvel pretty much ever. The one instance I can think of is seeing some of the Fantastic Four at Dan Turpin's funeral in Superman: The Animated Series, but that's because Turpin was based on Jack Kirby and they dedicated the episode to his memory.    Aside from that, the only other DC cartoon I can think of that ever referenced Marvel was some villain who was basically an evil Spider-Man that Artemis took down in Season 1 of Young Justice.    Oh shit, wait, I almost forgot about Batman Beyond. That show was chock full of Marvel references. There are a lot of parodies not necessarily between Terry and Peter, but definitely between some enemies. Stalker is similar to Kraven, Spellbinder was like Mysterio (though Spellbinder was in fact a character who's existed in DC since the Silver Age, though Marvel created Mysterio first), and I've seen folks compare Inque to Venom, but beyond being black blobs I don't really see it. Those two are pretty different. There may be others I'm forgetting.    The big one was season 1, episode 8 of Batman Beyond, ""heroes"". That entire episode was basically a story about the Fantastic Four if everything immediately went wrong. It was not a happy story."

justiceleague,380hbr,tidal49,2,Mon Jun 1 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"Another one from the DCAU was a Justice League episode that paid homage to the Defenders.  The most recognizable parallel was Solomon Grundy. Grundy's character was expanded to make him more like the Hulk. He had already had the Hulk-style speaking, but this episode had him being chased by the military and wanting to be left alone. He also got his own version of ""Hulk Smash"".  The episode has a gut-punch of an ending.  With Black Spider in Young Justice, they really went all-out. Greg Weisman recruited Josh Keaton to do the same voice that he used to play Spider-Man in The Spectacular Spider-Man series (which Weisman also ran)."

(I point to the wonderful speech from Kill Bill pt 2 re: Superman perceiving the human race as weak).   What IS important is she decides she is a strong and powerful woman and decides to use the gifts she has to do the right thing.   The big problem the trailer has is the music track that some schmo producer told his editor to slap in there to make it seem young and hip."

Hell, if it were a Timmverse production I'd expect better continuity.  But it's a superhero TV show, and it's not even intended to be a gritty realistic one like Heroes or Batman:TAS or even Arrow. The main character got his powers from a yellow lightning bolt and a weird particle accelerator. We've seen a guy turn into gas and back into a person, we've see a guy turn into metal and back again.

In the first episode of JL Unlimited, Green Lantern is trying to recruit Green Arrow. Batman approaches Green Arrow and pretty much asks him why he hasn't accepted his offer. Green Arrow says ""with all of you fighting the big guys there's nobody left to protect the little guys."" To which Batman replies, ""Those big guys tend to step on the little guys.""  So with that logic, join full time, Batman. I get that you want to protect Gotham, but through out the series you have various heroes who are absent during fights, which leads you to believe that they're protecting their respected city (i.e. Central City, Metropolis), so why can't you do the same? Which he does but considers himself part-time to be cooler"

Morrison didn't write the event, but has to include the outcome in his title to fit into continuity. The Wonder Woman you see later is actually Hippolyta IIRC. On yo the story itself. This volume is the Rock of Ages storyline, right? People like it because it's a perfect example of Batgod, and everyone lives Batgod. He always has the answer, and Morrison is part of the reason Batman is so unbelievably unbeatable. Now, I love Morrison, but I do agree that Rock of Ages isn't the best story. I do encourage you to keep going with JLA because it really does have some good stuff in it, and Waids run directly after Morrisons is spectacular."

It's also a little off-putting that he chooses to gloss over interpersonal relationships amongst the team in favor of action.  BUT, his JLA is one that only tackles world-threatening problems (there's a real grand scale to each of his stories), and he uses the Leaguers' powers in awesome and sometimes unique ways. Plus, it really accomplished its goal of moving away from the sometimes obscure, 2nd/3rd tier members and restoring it's place to the top of the sales charts."

Also, the recent Legion of Superheroes arch was a great read, but when the characters in the book acknowledge it's hard to keep the Legion straight, you've got a problem. I'd still recommend picking it up, especially if you're in Canada."

justiceleague,2vlqqo,Calypto52,2,Fri Feb 13 04:41:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, forgot about Hawkman. He's there too. I hope they get the legion sorted as well, but I don't know if this story was the way to do it. Either way, two good opening archs. Let me know what you think!"

justiceleague,2v85np,Adekis,2,Fri Feb 27 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"The New Frontier is my favorite, personally. Doom and Crisis on Two Earths are good, serviceable Justice League movies. Flashpoint isn't really a JL movie, it's a Flash movie.  JL:War is okay but lacking in plot. JL: Throne of Atlantis is significantly better on the story front but for my money just a bit anti-climactic.  But you cannot go wrong with Justice League / Unlimited. They nerf more than half the characters more than half the time but the plot and characterization are consistently phenomenal.  Young Justice is great but don't go in for it if you want to see Superman and Batman kicking ass all the time. They won't be, it's about the kids first and foremost, to the occasional detriment of the League's characterization and action."
justiceleague,2uzw2l,JimboJimboSlicee,2,Fri Feb 6 16:25:44 2015 UTC,Really excited for Constantine Hellblazer and Martian Manhunter specifically. I hope they go a little darker with Constantine compared to the two volumes out now...
justiceleague,2uzw2l,jaysusTHC,1 point,Sat Feb 7 05:02:03 2015 UTC,The current arc has been surprisingly good for being an Earth 2: World's End tie-in.
justiceleague,2uuhu8,crazy_brown_guy,5,Thu Feb 5 06:21:48 2015 UTC,"I figured this was going to happen since that newspaper from the future in The Flash stated ""The Flash missing after crisis."""
justiceleague,2uuhu8,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,2,Thu Feb 5 07:46:56 2015 UTC,"Except flash, green arrow, atom aren't apart of the movie universe  Teens Titans could be separate from the Arrow/Flash Verse and Vixen if I'm not mistaken is going to be animated."
justiceleague,2uuhu8,GentleGiant21,1 point,Thu Feb 5 09:08:29 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. Didn't realize it.
justiceleague,2uuhu8,GentleGiant21,1 point,Thu Feb 5 09:15:00 2015 UTC,It's cool dude That would be awesome as shit :)
justiceleague,2uuhu8,NoahJAustin,2,Thu Feb 5 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"I would say it's entirely possible. I don't think we'll ever see a true COIE happen on screen (unless they animate it, like DKR), but some sort of earth-hopping thing is likely to happen at some point. IMO it's far more likely for something like this to happen if Marvel's Dr. Strange movie turns out as reported. Supposedly, that film will deal with universe-hopping, reality bending subject material. If the audience can countenance that, DC/WB is more likely to feel free to also move in that direction."
justiceleague,2uuhu8,ninjartist,2,Thu Feb 5 14:17:33 2015 UTC,"Yes COIE would be too large-scale to turn to a live action movie, but I'm hoping Justice league is just the tip of the iceberg."
