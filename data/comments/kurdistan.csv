From my perspective the situation seems kind of like a spoiled kid that expects to eat the cookie and keep it at the same time. Then again many in the riots probably aren't PKK or supporters, but those aren't who I'm referring to."
kurdistan,3dxp3a,beyw,2,Mon Jul 20 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, to be honest, I have never agreed with those wanting the Turkish state to help Kurds out in situations like Kobanê. But that opinion of mine is solely based on which group it is that's asking for help. I personally don't think the PKK nor the PYD/YPG, as organisations, want Turkey to aid them, but when its supporters ask for help, all while viewing the Turkish state as a terrorist entity that ought to be fought in some way or another, it feels hypocritical. That's just what I think and the feeling I get from people wanting help from Turkey. Yes, it appears they want to keep the cookie whilst wanting to eat it as well.  However, I think that if Turkey on a regional level was a responsible and mature country, it would have aided Kobanê before its fall just for the cause of keeping stability and not letting true terrorists gain any land in the vicinity of its border (literally next to the border), but it's of course a complex situation.   But on another note, if the people asking Turkey to intervene have some justification for their demands (which they to a certain degree), it is that Turkey is the nation that has allowed (on purpose) these entities to become such relevant threats to the region, and in this case the Kurds' situation. Without the funding/benefit of passivity from Turkey, the islamists would not be as large and dangerous as they are today."

Many docters will work in the morning at a public hospital and later at a private one.   In the private industrie it's a lot different. Western companies do the normal 9-5.

kurdistan,3dyi14,ipconfider,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:08 2015 UTC,But it differs quite a lot depending on the season right (siesta's in the summer)? And on the sector. So my uncle who is self-employed works in the summer from 8/9 to 13 and then 17 to 19 approximately (he comes home to eat and sleep during the heat). It's pointless to stay open then because everybody is at home. In other seasons this is not the case. My cousin who works in a factory (Western company) always does regular 8 hour shifts. In the summer there is of course also more tourism so don't be surprised to see many random stores open at midnight.

kurdistan,3dk8jz,Znertu,3,Thu Jul 16 23:05:06 2015 UTC,"A total coincidence that I found this. I was just looking for more information on the amount of Kurds in Iran, and one of the hard parts thereof is that of Kurds in West Azerbaijan province, since it's so mixed.   I don't know how serious of a discussion this was, but I'd say it's an interesting idea. The Kurdish presence in historical Azerbaijan used to be far greater, and is as old as the first attestations of Kurds, but that toponym has now taken a different connotation. I know Iranian Kurds often aren't the most Kurdocentric, but I can understand if they'd feel marginalized in a province with 'Azerbaijan' as name.  If any 'North Kordestan/Kurdistan' province were to be created, that should only encompass the Kurdish areas of West Azerbaijan. And this is the difficult thing to determine, I was hoping any of you could help me out with that. Maps differ quite a bit:  Map 1 I'm pretty sure this one is not correct. As I understand, Urumiyah city has a clear Azeri majority. On a side note, I believe Ilam has a Kurdish majority.  Map 2 This one is made by Izady. Although his writings are not trustworthy, his maps tend to be pretty good.  Map 3 This one quite similar to Izady's map, but Kurds seem to have a little less land here.  Edit: I just saw the article's from last year, my bad."
kurdistan,3dk8jz,CitizenSnipsReturned,4,Thu Jul 16 23:32:56 2015 UTC,"It's not happening, this article making news over regular trivial banter within Iran. Iran has a lot of major problems to solve and the government isn't concerned on redrawing provincial borders, especially when it isn't really being a thorn in their side. The article gets a little misleading at times;   Last year, Iranian lawmakers discussed annexing Azerbaijan. Iran ceded much of the Caucasus, including Azerbaijan, during the 19th century to the Russian Empire, and Iranian legislators have argued that several treaties signed at that time should be revoked.  The suggestion of annexation provoked uproar in Baku, and came after Iranian lawmakers called for a public referendum in Azerbaijan to decide whether the country should join the Islamic republic.   This was after Azerbaijan made claims to Azeri populated areas in Northern Iran and said they were ready to take control if/when Tehran collapsed. Iran did a f.u and returned the favour and certain media outlets starting spewing that Iran was going to invade their neighbours etc. This was all big news in Iran a the time.  Then the article references stupid facebook comments;   Another Facebook user, Mohammad Jahane, commented on January 7: ""Kurds were in Iran when [Azeris] didn't even know where Iran was. The first Turkic migration to Iran came after the invasion of the Seljuk Turks [Turkic tribes from Central Asia]. Kurds, however, migrated to Iran thousands of years ago.""   Azeris are ethnically Iranian as much as Kurds and Persians. They were linguistically Turkified during the occupation of Orghuz Turks and certainly aren't a new people to the region. It's a bad article to reference bunk like this."

Azeris are 60% while kurds are 40% of the population.
kurdistan,3dk8jz,revengineering,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:40 2015 UTC,"u know this is a difficult thing 2 do, the government has already drawned the provincial borders, and it doesnt care about ethnicity that much to make sure ppl fit within certain provnices. it also fits their agenda because more integration reduces ethnic conflict. But if u wanted to redraw those provincial lines, u could just put them into the pre-existing kordestan province, u dont have 2 make a new one. iran is seperated into 5-ish regions, (like kordestan, khorasan, fars, etc)    I believe Ilam has a Kurdish majority.   i think u are correct here, although it might also be a near 50% split. its hard 2 tell in iran given how everyones ethnic traits are simmilar, the topic of ethnicicty kind of falls in the background and ppl just start to care less and less about it."

Even though it makes sense; Saudi Arabia is not friendly with Iran, Iraq and Syria (still friendly with Turkey) and you are right about SA's economic power and their control of media (they own so much Middle Eastern media), I think it's mostly because of Saudi Arabia being a somewhat pariah state in international politics. Many countries deal with them economically but people generally despise them because of their strict laws, oppression of opponents, and support of terrorism. Besides, SA supports groups that have threatened Kurds in Syria right now. The Kurds look to the West generally and want to be like that, not like Saudi Arabia. Kurds can and maybe even should establish ties with SA but just loose political and economic ties and demand something for the Kurds in Syria. We should definitely refrain from choosing sides in the Iran vs. Saudi Arabia conflict."

Saudi Arabia has actively supported the same groups within Kurdistan that have now joined Da3esh, I don't trust funding or money coming from a primarily Salafi/Wahabist background as it has ruined every country it's invested in.

Anyways 30% in Yemen and just Yemen which what 24 million out of 400 million Arabs (I love how you have to focus so much on just yemenis to paint the entire region.)  Keep in mind Yemeni and Saudis are 99% Muslim unlike Kurds yet even then Kurdish percentages are still higher. If it was from Muslim culture a population that percentage wise is more Muslim that resides in the breadbasket of islam of all places should in fact be much higher. it is not.   Nearly every Middle Eastern country has the problem and they're all islamic, it's a clear obvious tread.   This discussion is fruitless. Pointing the blame on the system or others is moronic. 60% of Kurds do it yet you argue it is not a part of Kurdish culture? keep your head in the sand buddy. I'm out  Did I also forget to mention FGM was banned just last year in Yemen whereas it has been banned in the KRG for over a decade. There is no ban at all in KSA. Still Kurds are higher  http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/may/06/yemen-child-brides-fgm-rights-act-law  Upon further research apparently much of the FGM in Yemen and KSA is also due to immigrants, from Africa and South Asia. This is not the case in for Kurdistan  https://hivos.org/sites/default/files/stop_fgm_-_also_in_the_middle_east_0.pdf  http://www.stopfgmmideast.org/countries/saudi-arabia/  Pic of the girl in the above does not look to Arab now does she? The above proves my point that certain cultures have a higher prevalence- South Asians, Kurds and Nile Valley peoples who all engaged in the practice before Islam. Look at Eriteria and Ethiopia and S Sudan. They are Christian. These ethnic groups that are now Muslim lived the same way  you irl   However, there are hints that FGM even though traditionally not know in most parts of the country may be even spreading for religious reasons. This is the opinion of Sheikh Yussif al-Badri, a rather notorious Egyptian cleric who considers the practice demanded by Islam. In an interview with the BBC, he is proud to announce that this view is now taking root in Saudi Arabia and Libya and more and more people are obeying by it. Certainly the wish could be father to the thought here."

kurdistan,3d1ffm,kamran79,3,Sun Jul 12 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"namenof the game should be economical cooperation between,Turkey,Arabs,Kurds,persians and not seperation. War doesnot payoff. Cultural exchange,economical cooperation and respect for one another culture and belief will bring peace and prosperity to the region and that what we need.   i have to agree, i dont see why this would be bad for us, infact this would be great for us. to make an enemy with iran is to make an artificial enemy just for a ego.    Iran comes second as a major trading partner for Iraqi Kurds after Turkey. In 2013, the year before ISIL expanded its presence in Iraq and plunged the country into a full-fledged war, the volume of trade exchange between Iraq's KRG and Iran exceeded $4bn, according to KRG officials.  As a deal on Iran's nuclear programme is expected to prompt the removal of some of the economic sanctions on Iran, Kurds might be poised to reap the fruits of an Iranian economic boom. ""Iranian economic influence will bring with it increased prospects for economic growth and investments,"" said Farhan Hanif Siddiqi, a research fellow at the Middle East Research Institute, a largely KRG-funded think-tank in Erbil.   ""The KRG, for example, is interested in importing gas from Iran in order to produce cheap electricity,"" Siddiqi told Al Jazeera. ""Iran is interested in oil and gas pipeline deals with the KRG and vice versa, and one expects such deals to go through after the nuclear agreement.""  Not all are concerned that a nuclear deal means a larger Iranian role in Iraq. Some, in fact, predict the opposite may happen.  ""So far, because there has been no deal and there are sanctions, Iran wants to show it is strong and does what it wants, hence its interventions in places like Iraq, its autonomous Kurdistan region, Syria and elsewhere,"" said Abdulsalam Barwari, a former member of Kurdish parliament from the KDP.  ""I think in the event of a deal, Iran is likely to be more bound by certain conditions and restrictions [from the rest of the world].""    i think that makes my point good enough, i think its important to also add that we share a lot with iranians culturally, religiously, traditionally, and even ethnicly. while i have problems with the regime (soft discrimination against sunnis, very little freedom of speech) , ideology shouldnt come in the way of concrete ethnic and cultural bonds that span thousands of years.   also iran doesnt order bashar al-babykiller or the iraqi government on how 2 run their country, why would they ever do that to us?? if iran did anything in both of those countries significantly assad woulnt be loosing the war and maliki would have been longone before 2014. as someone from rojhelat i might be bias, but i think this is a good deal for all of us, both kurds and iranians.  we need a strong regional ally with power, israel isnt that, and neither is europe who isnt even regional. and iran treats us better than the arabs or torks. y would be put ourselves on the opposite side?"

You just have to listen closely because back then he probably didn't just speak Sorani but also some dialect. The differences in vocabulary between Kurmanci and Sorani aren't that huge actually, it's just that we often find the others to be speaking too fast and with a dialect it becomes hard to understand.

It will create temporary jobs but those dams and roads only take a few years to finish and then those jobs are gone. This is not a long term investment in Kurdistan. Besides, for that small benefit other Kurds (and also Arabs) in the south will have less water like with all the other dams Turkey has built. Add that to the destruction of Kurdish heritage and I can only conclude that this is another selfish act by Ankara."

kurdistan,3cx7o3,Znertu,8,Sun Jul 12 07:31:36 2015 UTC,"The dams obviously serve another purpose than simply to provide the Kurdish population of Turkey with benefits and all that. Controll of water flow has always been very important, and establishing dams in northern Kurdistan gives the Turkish government the upper hand in controll of the land. They can literally flood villages and other cultural heritages, as well as have an effect on Syria. They can stop access to water, etc, there are obvious advantages for the Turkish government in creating dams both domestically and regionally.   It's not all black and white, yknow: ""jeez Kurds don't want dams in their country, do they want to continue to be poor or what!?!?""  Whether you think so or not, KCK consists of intelligent people and organizations, there are reasons for these interjections.

kurdistan,3cx7o3,Ashihna,5,Sat Jul 11 23:02:50 2015 UTC,Shit like this is the reason why South Eastern Anatolia is such a backwarded shithole.   Not necessarily. The dams are as much a tool of control as they are one of economic development
kurdistan,3cx7o3,beyw,6,Sat Jul 11 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed, as beyw pointed out, the dams are not as benevolent as they may sound.   For one, Hasankeyf and other historically rich regions are to be drowned. The dams do not provide that much electricity, and if these places had been properly excavated and restored, they would've had great touristic potential. These are of great historical value in general, not just for the locals. In Dêrsim too, dams are planned, which will drown much of the natural and cultural beauty of the area. The inhabitants of these areas have protested many, many times.    Secondly, many people will have to move. In the case of Hasankeyf, they are to be housed in New Hasankeyf, but most of these people are poor, are offered little money, and subsequently cannot afford the new housing.  Thirdly, there's indications that the dams are, at least in part, built simply to combat the PKK. From link or link, take your pick:  ""From the outset, the South-east Anatolia Project has had profound security implications. It is no coincidence that the project is situated in the Kurdish region of Turkey - where a bitter civil war rages between the Kurds and the Turkish military. The expected security benefits are twofold, by increasing the income of hitherto impoverished Kurds the government in Ankara hopes the new wealth will induce the people to support the government. More pragmatically, the project will transform the geography of Turkish Kurdistan. Improved communications, combined with new industries and farms, will shepherd the Kurds out of their traditional mountain fastness into planned urban areas where the government can keep greater control over them. An underlying motive of the project is to deny the Kurdish guerrillas the environment in which they operate.""  Turkey could be building solar farms or wind farms aplenty, and that would impact the enviroment and its people much less, instead, it sees no problem in drowning human heritage for the purpose of greater control over Kurds."

It's doubtful there are many if at all in the regimes royal guard since they are quite regime supportive, but in their army, in their towns yes plenty. The issue is merging the various and multiple ethnic militias under one cause.  Personally it's only a matter of time before the regime cracks down to hard on protesters or political parties and a boil over effect will happen like it has been seen elsewhere in the ME. And iran has a less of a chance at ending up like syris due to the quite high ethnic group minorities (between the kurds, baluchs, jurs theres around 20+million)If the sanctions stay in place and iran continues to support assad and in iraq both monetarily to arm their groups and with manpower it'll continue to weaken their grasp.  And for the record, I am not anti-iranian. The persian suffer under the regime too. I am anti regime.

The Turks are trying to label YPG as terrorists, so when will the lies stop? When will the accusations stop? If the PKK disbands, they will focus on the YPG, do you want that? Better to fight it head on and refute it so it has no strength.

Devlet Bahçeli(leader of MHP) acted like an idiot in the past 2 weeks. Some MHP voters will vote for CHP if early elections happen I'd say.

Since you guys were Iranian and now are Turkic. I don't have much to say about Azeri people since I haven't met many haha.   But my dad had some Azeri friends in Soviet and he always told me that they were humble and proud of their culture.

Azeris and Turks now come together at nationalist rallies with the same hate chants against minorities. Azeri news channels against Kurds is very similar to the Turkish nowadays. Azeris also copy and believe the pan-Turkic BS spread from Turkey.  I am very skeptical of Azeri-Kurd relationship. As long as you get closer to Turks, you'll get farther away from Kurds."

kurdistan,3cgwjz,revengineering,5,Wed Jul 8 09:37:45 2015 UTC,"Excellent question. So the answer would be kind of. The KRG (Kurdish Regional Government) has been autonomous for a long time now. We have our own political powers that are able to make local decisions, we have our own military (Peshmerga), our own police (Asayish) and do pretty much everything we want. Now the last link that we have to the Iraqi government is the oil. The KRG is supposed to get 17% of the profits from selling oil, but Baghdad are being complete assholes and are not giving us our money.  The second thing that is missing is international recognition. Mainly because of Turkey and their strategic geopolitical position and their adherence to NATO (they have control of the Black Sea and therefore they are able to block Russia), the Western countries are willing to forget about KRG. But things are starting to change a bit as we are pretty much the only ones that are able to deal with Daesh savages. This is why we are getting direct weapon deliveries from Germany and increasing support from the UK, France etc... However, the US is not directly giving us the weapons, they are delivering them through Baghdad, and as you could imagine, we don't receive them. SO I would say we are getting more and more recognition but we are not still there yet.   If Iraq collapses (which I believe will happen sooner or later), we can get our independence in a peaceful way, and we would get international recognition and the money from oil. The other way would be through war, but that would not grant us enough support and could turn out bad.. So we'll see!"

Iran is already feasting on the Shiites of Iraq by now, so in my opinion, just let the natural borders play out and the situation will eventually settle down. At least I hope so!

It's small (more like a village than a city), but it's on top of a hill and I remember an old gate. And it's close to Silav (touristic area in the mountain) which is very nice and the area is also beautiful. If you can combine it with your visit to Zakho then you can get the other road through the mountains from Zakho (via Batifa) instead of going from Duhok, but this is not a must see or anything, just an idea. By the way, Amedi is known for its tahin and harir :P  So you are willing to go all the way to Suli? Then yes you should visit that city and the Zagros mountains and Dokan Lake. But closer to Duhok and if you're visiting Akre: Rawanduz. Lalish (Ezidi city) is also close to Duhok.  If it's nature you're interested in, you can get to mountains from any city. Just don't head into mountains randomly because of possible land mines and snakes."

There are tons of places to visit around the region but you have to know somebody around here who knows where to go. Halgord-Sakran national park is incredible, it contains Halgord, the highest mountain in Iraq at 3605 meters, and also Sakran village which is at the base of Hasar mountain, which is around 3500 meters and is absolutely stunning. This area can have snow well into April and May, high up on the mountains of course. For some cultural tourism do a day trip out to Mar Matti (ancient monestary close to a city called Bardarash), Khenis (2300 year old Assyrian rock relief), Akre (an ancient city which has houses cascading up the mountain), Lalish (Azdi's most important temple), Jerwan (part of the oldest aqueduct in the world which brought water from close to Sheikhan down to the Nineveh plains, new theories suggest that the Gardens of Babylon could have actually been in Nineveh and not Babylon due to this aqueduct), then head over to Al Qosh, another ancient monestary, and the town itself has a ruined synagogue as there were relatively large Jewish communities in Kurdistan. Then spend the night in Duhok. Next day head out to the mountains above Duhok, head to Gara mountain where the ruins of Saddams old palace are, then down to the ancient city of Amediya which lies on a natural citadel. You can then drive through the Barzan region, obviously where the Barzani's are from. In that area you're surrounded by huge gorgeous mountains. You can visit Shanidar cave where archeologists in the 1950's found Neaderthal skeletons which date back to over 60,000 years ago. Then head up to Gali Ali Beg, Bekhal, Korek Mountain, Rawanduz Gorge. Head over to Sulai to get some culture and less of a deserty city. Tons of things to do around that area, like take a visit at Dukan Lake where you can take boat rides to some great swimming spots. You can head south to Halabja, hit up Hawraman area, maybe Darbandikhan Lake. Lots of things to do around here you just need to know someone who knows how to get around and its completely safe."

kurdistan,3c71hr,Bionemker,4,Sun Jul 5 13:48:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, it was Syrian Kurds who had been victims of ethnic cleansings at the hands of the Syrian regime, through which the demographic character of the region was changed. [2]   According to the Peace in Kurdistan Campaign, other policies of ethnic cleansing and cultural devastation of the Syrian regime included:   The conversion of all fertile lands in the Kurdish region into public property under the name of a 'land reform policy', and housing the Arab tribes in those areas after forcing the Kurds to migrate, by depriving them of property ownership, especially agricultural property. Changing the names of all Kurdish cities and villages and replacing them with names that are not historically related to the region. The main objective of this policy is to Arabize and change the demographic features of the region. The settlement of Arab tribes, whose lands were affected by flooding, in Kurdish areas. Preventing the Kurdish people from celebrating their own festivals, such as Newroz. Preventing the Kurds from supporting and communicating with their brethren in other parts of Kurdistan.   The historian Dr. Jordi Tejel also wrote about the human rights violations against Syrian Kurds in his book Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society. [3] Some of them include:   After the Baath party in 1958 led Syria to integrate itself with Egypt in the United Arab Republic (UAR), under Gamal Nasser, ""recordings of Kurdish music were smashed in cafes. The publication and even the possession of books written in Kurdish language were offences punishable by imprisonment. Egyptian teachers were sent into Kurdish regions."" ""[T]he authorities were accused in November 1960 by the inhabitants of Amuda [a Kurdish town] of causing a fire in a movie house that caused the death of 283 Kurdish children. Those responsible for this act were presumably motivated by anti-Kurdish sentiments, the fruits of official propaganda in opposition to Kurdish nationalism associated with Zionism and American imperialism."" ""[B]etween 1946 and 1957, the Syrian Kurds had no political organization to defend their rights. (e.g. cultural rights.)"" Finally, the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Syria (KDPS) was founded in 1957. ""[O]n August 5, 1960, the leaders of the executive committee of Aleppo were arrested and tortured. The party organization was discovered and within a few days more than 5000 people were arrested and interrogated. The leaders of the KDPS were accused of separatism and finally condemned to prison."" One of the most serious violations against Kurds was the census of 1962, in which about 120,000 Kurds lost their citizenship in their own homeland and were registered as ""aliens.""[4] Syrian Kurds were also exposed to the racist propaganda of the Arab media. A campaign launched by the Arab media sported slogans such as 'Save Arabism from Jazira' or 'Fight the Kurdish Menace'."" The teaching of the Kurdish language remained prohibited during the time of Hafez al-Assad, as well. In 1970s, the public school became, for the Kurds, not only a place of Baathist indoctrination, as it was for other Syrians, but also a place of Arabization. ""With the increase in literate children in the Kurdish regions, a tight surveillance system was established there, following the example of the Turks, by means of 'spies,' to stop the children from speaking Kurdish among themselves. Children discovered in flagrant 'defiance' could be physically punished."" ""Though the ban on Kurdish publications had already begun with Adib al-Shiskali's presidency (1951-54), under the Baathist regime measures of legal coercion were reinforced, obliging Kurdish authors and editors to have their publications printed in Lebanon, and afterwards they could be illegally brought back to Syria."" ""Two decrees from the 1980s forbade the use of Kurdish in the workplace, as well as during marriage ceremonies and festivities."" ""In the province of Al-Hasakah, in 1992, officers of the civil state began to more strictly apply the restriction against registering children with Kurdish names, in accordance with decree no. 122."" ""In May 2000, a little before the death of Hafiz al-Asad, resolution 768 ordained the closing of all stores selling cassettes, videos, and disks in the Kurdish language and re-emphasized the prohibition of using this language during meetings and festivities."""

kurdistan,3c7061,FatedLeague,11,Sun Jul 5 13:30:47 2015 UTC,"Incoming wall of text!   Half Kurdish and half Scandinavian here. I've been in Kurdistan (Iraq) several times for varying periods of time; the longest was the year right after Saddam's fall.  I understand pretty much everything people say in Sorani, and can read the alphabet. I'm interested in politics and follow Kurdistan especially closely. However, I don't have good active grasp of the language. Expressing anything on a slightly complicated topic is difficult.  As a kid I was very proud of my kurdish half, and would never claim one cultural attachment was stronger than the other. The two parts were inseparable, and even when people asked I would never be anything but both nationalities.  I'm a woman in my early twenties now. I'm raised in a culture where I'm now an adult free to do what I want with my own means. My family has never restricted me in any way. Visiting Kurdistan, the role and freedom I take for granted where I live, is suddenly questioned and often removed. Basically, being an adult has made my experience as a ""half"" complicated.  On the one hand, I've lived in Kurdistan and experienced how I have a constant status as a ""foreigner"". The Kurds I meet thinks I'm American or European. They stare, talk about me behind my back, whistle and beep their cars if I'm out walking by myself (or with only female relatives).  On the other hand, I feel that Kurds often try to ""claim"" me when they learn I'm half kurdish. ""Why do you not speak kurdish?"" (in kurdish...). ""Your father is kurdish, you should be muslim; dress in a certain way etc."" This is very tiresome and invasive (and always comes from strangers). But I always have a cultural free-card in my foreigness and can pretty much do what I want within reasonable limits.  At this point, I consider myself more Scandinavian than Kurdish. I feel like I've gone out of my way and made an impressive effort to embrace my kurdish roots, but my ventures has not paid out. I could never again live in Kurdistan because I'm a secular, independent, working woman with western ideals and because I'm lacking language and cultural keys. I've sadly discovered that I can't become fully Kurdish even if I tried.   However, I'm still ""half"". I don't look Scandinavian and I don't look Kurdish. Even in my home country my nationality is questioned, and I'm asked where ""I'm really from"". I've developed a pretty ambigous relationship to my own nationality and cultural background, where I don't fully belong anywhere.  While not universal, I think the things I've mentioned above are things many bi-cultural people will recognize.  Hope this help shed some light on your question. I may seem negative, but I still am both kurdish and Scandinavian, and have strong feelings for both.   Edit: added a """
kurdistan,3c7061,Kurdishhybrid,5,Mon Jul 6 00:40:27 2015 UTC,"I'm Full Kurdish and still get stared at, talked behind my back and whatever else comes with being slightly different in Kurdistan.   It's not that big of a deal, it's just people aren't use to something different. It only affects you as much as you let it affect you."
kurdistan,3c7061,viglen,3,Mon Jul 6 05:58:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true. Even if you are fully kurdish simple things like clothing and your bearing would alert people to the fact that you're ""different"".  Actually, my intentions are not to complain. Most of the reactions I get are far from malicious, however, OP asked about how people with my cultural background view themselves and are treated by others; the reactions I get from Kurdish strangers when walking about in Kurdistan is part of my experience of the ""cultural ambiguity"" of being both inside and outside a culture.  While everyone slightly different encounter reactions, I think there's a difference in the way their curiosity manifest. Because when they stare at me -- a person that has a sense of cultural belonging, but who looks like I don't -- it amplifies my sense of foreignness. People will shout english greetings, they'll wonder why the ajnabi is there, excited kids have followed my family around yelling ""ameriki! ameriki!"", if someone comments on my looks they might say stuff like ""foreigners are so pretty"" or ""Kurdish girls are the most beautifull after all"" etc. These kinds of reactions can feel like rejections, because, after all, I'm Kurdish too.  If you look like a Kurdish person who's visiting from the West, I imagine the curiosity -- stares and comments -- manifest in a different way."

What I'm trying to say is People tend to react weirdly to things they're not used to. A half kurdish girl who doesn't wear like locals is probably one of them."

It will only be that way if you let it bother you, or you let it take over your thought process. I remember initially it was quite annoying, but then i realized it's their way of getting used to something they haven't seen before. I mean, them trying to talk to you in English isn't them being dicks, it's them trying to say something they think you'll appreciate.   I have had a terrific time in Kurdistan once I let go of this assumption that those who stare or those who immediately assume I'm foreign are just nice people with an odd way of showing it.   I've found the friendliest of people come from those that are least exposed, and I've also found that we as Expats have quite abit of a complex when it comes to how we look at locals. Whether we like it or not, we look at them in an odd way, and create some distance, and this distance only makes those who've lived all their lives in Kurdistan feel that we're being arrogant.   Once we're not afraid to immerse ourselves properly do you realise it's not such a big deal, and to be honest...the fun and friendships I've had with people who have never ever seen more then even Hawler, is far higher then those who like me lived abroad for sometime and came back. I too started to believe that Expat Kurds are quite arroagant because of how I saw they saw themselves."
kurdistan,3c7061,viglen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm answering OP's question about my own subjective experience of how Kurds view and treat me. It doesn't really bother me, and I never insinuated they were ""dicks"", but it do affects the way I experience my Kurdish half. I don't think anyone without my actual experience - being half European and half Kurdish and looking it - can wave away my experience as me being too sensitive which is what I gather that you and some others seem to think.   I'm not an expat. I'm born in Scandinavia and have a Scandinavian family (just as I have a Kurdish family).   This immersion you talk of is something I won't ever be able to achieve in the same way as someone fully Kurdish. It may be hard for you to believe that, but I believe I have written enough for that point to be clear. This has nothing to do with arrogance or lack of effort."

kurdistan,3c7061,Kurdishhybrid,2,Mon Jul 6 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah this was the type of response I was looking for. For me it's a bit easier being half Kurdish and half Persian, but even every once and a while I may get/view something that makes me feel like I'm a foreigner (probably more because I was raised in Australia). I've always wanted to know how a half Kurd and half something else that was more distant may feel or is treated. Man I can't imagine the trouble you might have faced when you passed the checkpoints in Iraqi Kurdistan or even the airport. I remember one time I was at a checkpoint and they took both me and my dad's passport's for sometime (my dads Persian) and they started speaking english to us as it stated our nationality was Australian. It was so F**** retarded because me and my dad were clearly speaking Kurdish to them beforehand for like 10 mintues (both of our Kurdish is pretty good since he was a Peshmerga and I speak Kurdish at home) yet they insisted on speaking English like this:  ""Ah zer do u com afrom?""  It wasn't that they couldn't understand us either, we were speaking perfectly fine for 10 minutes, but all of the sudden they see a white country in our passport and try to speak English.  Other than that when I usually go around Iraqi Kurdistan myself they view me as Kurdish, and due to my slight foreign accent, they just think I was a Kurd raised in 'Beritania'."
kurdistan,3c7061,Kurdishhybrid,2,Mon Jul 6 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"Haha, funny how they'd rather speak broken English to you and your father. Maybe he just wanted to show off his skillzzz xD  The first couple of times I travelled to Kurdistan with my family, we had to fly to Ankara and drive over the border. The Turkish border control could be pretty nasty. But I think the Scandinavian passports made them much more cooperative.   I've never had much trouble at checkpoints (never gone through a checkpoint alone) or at the airport (travelled alone several times). They'll ask some questions, but I've never been held up. The worst thing is the Asaish visit to get the visa or whatever. That's always a bureaucratic affair with blood tests and stuff.   But then again, I haven't been back for a couple of years now.

kurdistan,3c7061,Kurdishhybrid,2,Mon Jul 6 04:36:00 2015 UTC,I think any Kurdish woman (full or half) raised in the West would say the same. It's not because you're a half Kurd. Even I as a male recognize a lot of what you are saying. I realise now that I will always be seen as an outsider here in The Netherlands and in Kurdistan.   This is very tiresome and invasive (and always comes from strangers).   People LOVE to interfere.
kurdistan,3c7061,FeyliXan,3,Mon Jul 6 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"As I said, the feeling of truly not belonging anywhere is probably very recognizable to anyone bi-cultural. I'm not surprised that any Kurdish person raised in the West have the same experiences, after all, you are bi-cultural too.  And as you said, any woman raised in the West would react negatively to the less gender equal Kurdish society. I fully agree that that has nothing to do with being full or half.  But I do think there are nuances and subtle differences in the sense of cultural belonging that someone ""full"" and someone ""half"" has. I think exactly how big or small those differences are depends on very individual factors of how you were socialized and how your everyday life unfolds.  Maybe what I wrote above about the feeling of belonging/not belonging is too universal to anyone bi-cultural. But trying to capture those nuances would make my examples less about me and more about my family. Most of them don't really answer OP's questions neither.  Here are two examples, I think one has to be half to experience. Make of them what you want.   Firstly, my name: I have two surnames. I don't use the Kurdish one on my CV here, and in Kurdistan they're only interested in the Kurdish one. Having two surnames is a cultural luxury and important for my cultural identity; while the fact that I feel the need to switch them out based on where I am kinda amplifies the feeling on not being fully accepted by either.  And, secondly my parents: They are not a cultural entity that comes home, switch back to a shared language, turn on their satelite TV and live in a micro-nation inside the nation. I've seen them fight and challenge and misunderstand each other because of different cultural background. I'm very much the result of their labour which is why I get especially frustrated when people try to label me as one above the other."
kurdistan,3c7061,che899,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"That feeling of not truly belonging anywhere, that's a feeling I've struggled with. I now realize I was overly protective of my Kurdish roots for that precise reason, kind of to make up for the fact that I don't look like a European and will be seen as ""the Kurd"" no matter what. But when I went to KRG after all these years, I learned the hard way that I'm not the same. The positive about this, is that we can take the best out of both worlds (strong family, but more freedom, for example). Another great thing is to hang out with people who have been through the same. I find that more often than not, they are much more open minded and interesting people! So I embrace my Kurdish roots, and I plan on marrying a Kurdish woman, but most definitely a woman who has been through the same. We can create out own community :)"

kurdistan,3c4av6,zerdasht,3,Tue Jul 7 22:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think a more accurate translation would be ""blessed"". That's why you use it at birthdays. Something like ""may it bring you blessings."" When somebody has bought a car: piroz bet."

kurdistan,3c4zp5,AmstelLight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:15:50 2015 UTC,"Almost all Kurdish politicians are nationalistic and for an independent Kurdistan, but when they actually get a position they tend to change their language because they know they will have to work with outsiders. Even the US would back off if the KRG suddenly talked about an uprising in Turkey or even in Iran."
kurdistan,3c4zp5,Jeffplz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:54:10 2015 UTC,Right now no one is really publicly voicing anything independence wise. Mainly due to all the things going on at the moment with ISIS and iraq being somewhat fractured. I wouldn't even say the PKK are nationalist st the moment. But most if not all the groups have their nationalist ideations. Just can't up and declare anything in the current situation with everything else going on.  Although the KDPI (kdp iranian) is starting to recruit again and is being more open on things.   I think once the tide turns more on ISIS and things settle you will see the parties start pushing for independence.(atleast in Iraq) it would be dumb of them not to with all the support nationally on the kurds now. Unsure of syria due to turkey but possibly see a semi autonomy in the ypg areas if and when the fighting dies down and depending on the victors.  Another issue with fucking with turkey iran and iraq is the issue of where you will send the oil. If kurdistsn (iraq) declares independence they won't be able to push oil through iraqi owned land. So that leaves you with turkey and iran and picking the lesser of two evils.  But really almost all of the parties are nationalistic just right now is not the time.
kurdistan,3c0cmn,superislam,3,Fri Jul 3 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Such inflammatory comments don't help the situation.  Granted the central government has completely and totally neglected the Kurdish regional government by tying their hands, crying foul on attempts to arm the Kurds directly and then not supplying them with their fair share of arms, I don't think public drama is called for.  It might be, but at the moment a strong and unified Kurdish voice is nowhere to be seen, so such calls for Independence are doomed to fall flat on their face."
kurdistan,3c0cmn,ihsw,2,Fri Jul 3 17:59:35 2015 UTC,I'm saying the KRG will not be free from the get go because no one in the leadership is calling for it. It's like the Occupy movement in the US -- leaderless yet vocal.
kurdistan,3c0cmn,ihsw,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"Wait a second, how is it inflammatory to say ""yes"" to this answer? Or stutter in anyway when asked if Kurds will be better off fighting ISIS when independent rather than not independent..   Al-Monitor:  Would you be more effective fighting them if you were independent?   He answers this question and the interview in general is quite fair and relaxed.  Quite simply of course the Kurds being independent will mean they will fight better against ISIS, it's not as if there's any examples of being one nation, Iraq is already split up in 3 pieces."

kurdistan,3bumd4,Axa2000,5,Thu Jul 2 07:47:59 2015 UTC,To do what exactly? Can you expand further on this article?
kurdistan,3bumd4,Llanganati,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:15:46 2015 UTC,It states recent ISIS activity around Kobanê area has caused great concern. President Barzani notified Peshmerga commanders to be prepared to deploy if situation escalates.   There isn't much other new information. It just repeats what occurred during Kobanê attack last week.
kurdistan,3bumd4,Axa2000,-1,Thu Jul 2 20:20:02 2015 UTC,If I had to guess it would be to crush the Revolution for their masters in Ankara.
kurdistan,3bumd4,viglen,4,Fri Jul 3 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"Why is it that everything KRG does, people assume it's for bad intentions?  South Kurdistan citizens actually want to see rojava succeed. Problem is PYD/PKK wants things done their way even when it comes to KRG related matters. For instance, shangal liberation, forming local militia and border security.   When KRG offered to send Peshmerga to Kobanê few months ago, PYD/PKK wanted Peshmerga to wear their flags and be under their control.  As for Ankara relationship, KRG has five million people to feed so it cannot depend only on central government for revenue. We have seen Baghdad use KRG finance against, provide low amount of military equipment, interfere with natural resources sale. If KRG bend over to all Baghdad regulations, South Kurdistan would be decades behind and possibly be under ISIS control.  Why is it a problem when KRG puts south kurdistan interests first instead of supporting PKK?"
kurdistan,3bumd4,Axa2000,3,Fri Jul 3 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"They are ignorant to how reality works and fall victim to very weak propaganda that convinces them that Kurds vs. Kurds is actually a thing.. They see articles suggesting Barzani shaking hands with Iraq, Iran, Turkey and other such nations and instantly believe that KRG are working against Kurds when in fact that they they must do these things for Kurdistan in Iraq to be able to stand up to them in the future..  Of course there is more needed to bring Kurds together, but you don't make that happen with attacks and insults, but with logical arguments to bring Kurds closer."

kurdistan,3btpgz,ghostofpennwast,4,Thu Jul 2 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"In US politics, I have always preferred Democrats and rooted for them. But they are so disappointing regarding the issue with arming the Peshmerga. Obama is being a dick, and so will be Hilary Clinton (if she gets elected). The Republicans seem to support us though, so if Republicans win next elections, there is a possibility that they will finally give us the means to destroy those goatfuckers. I don't know why they are so in love with the idea of keeping Iraq together, it's utterly shit. Iraq is imploding and they are forcing people who don't want to live together to do so."
kurdistan,3btpgz,FeyliXan,7,Thu Jul 2 02:19:44 2015 UTC,"It's highly questionable if either the Republicans or the Democrats give a damn about stabilizing the middle east, you all know very well what games they play."

But as it is today there seems to be no chance to get the weapons with Democrats, while there is a chance  that Republicans will directly give them to us instead of trying to work with the failed State that is Iraq. I'm not saying Republicans will give us the weapons because they think we are nice, but nevertheless, they tend to want to give them to us, whereas Democrats don't."
kurdistan,3btpgz,FeyliXan,0,Thu Jul 2 03:08:00 2015 UTC,"The weapons that the Republicans supply you with are the weapons that will keep you in firefights and your young dying for a long, long time. Keep that in mind."
kurdistan,3btpgz,Lucifer_L,4,Thu Jul 2 03:14:43 2015 UTC,"Actually no, the weapons that the current government is supplying the Iraqi government gets captured by ISIS and used against us. We have then to fight them with shitty ass Soviet AKs that we've been using for decades against a series of bloodthirsty dictators, including but not limited to Saddam Hussein. So it would be nice if we could have proper guns to fight terrorists that are indirectly being supplied by the US government."

kurdistan,3btpgz,FeyliXan,3,Fri Jul 3 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, I feel like us kurds need to become more and more independent and at one point be able to produce our own weapons and be able to go on our own, and become less dependent on other nations, might be very far away, but we need a beginning somewhere, the more you get from others, the more you need to give to others"

kurdistan,3btpgz,alxm3,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:09:29 2015 UTC,You do know that Democrats and Republicans supported the Iraq invasion of course?
kurdistan,3btpgz,RevengeoftheHittites,2,Thu Jul 2 07:41:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it was a Republican president who demanded the invasion. I was thinking Republicans would follow his steps by supporting unified iraq."
kurdistan,3btpgz,Axa2000,2,Thu Jul 2 08:05:42 2015 UTC,"Democrats are very much behind a unified Iraq to. Allowing Iraq to balkanize into three states would essentially put Baghdad directly into Iran's influence and would leave no serious opposition to ISIS, I think it should be obvious why this isn't in US interests. They want Kurdistan to be strong but not stronger than Baghdad."
kurdistan,3btpgz,natsidruk,8,Thu Jul 2 19:19:39 2015 UTC,"First of all, WHO is these ""Arab allies""? I want to hear it directly from them, rather than these half arsed quotes.. But I definitely agree, Obama is completely fucking the Kurds over with his policy and Cameron as usual is playing US puppy and following the same policy the US sets, doing what the UK does best and being pussies, not standing strong, not stopping the tons of fucking extremists within the UK, not actually showing that the UK can think for itself and what annoys me the most is the UK is such a coward against Turkey.  Someone said here, (and I think it makes sense a lot why Iraqi army has been failing so badly on the battlefields against isis) that simply because the iraqis are very divided that they simply do not want to stand and fight against isis if it's not their own lands they are fighting for, specifically the sunni and shia agenda and the many groups and factions that basically Iraq is already divided, they are not willing to die for the other groups. saddam's government was proof he was just oppressing the other groups and making sure his own were more dominant.. Whoever is in charge of Iraq will just end up stepping on the other factions, it's their nature.  Turkey and Iraq are selling themselves to the Americans to keep the U.S. from backing the Kurds and the U.S. is probably getting things from them in return.. The horrible truth is the U.S. is hurting themselves more by allowing the Turks to get what they want."
kurdistan,3btpgz,ihsw,2,Thu Jul 2 06:42:22 2015 UTC,"The reason he is doing this is not because he wants the Kurds unarmed, it is, as stated in the article, that they want the weapons to go through Baghdad.  After all why shouldn't the weapons going to Iraq be channeled through the capital of Iraq first"
kurdistan,3btpgz,thecake_is_a_lie1,4,Thu Jul 2 06:30:35 2015 UTC,Because Iraq is run by corrupt dickbags that attach conditions/concessions to every interaction?
kurdistan,3btley,ksmcqueen,10,Thu Jul 2 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"Currently in Erbil. There are tons of places to visit around the region but you have to know somebody around here who knows where to go. Halgord-Sakran national park is incredible, it contains Halgord, the highest mountain in Iraq at 3605 meters, and also Sakran village which is at the base of Hasar mountain, which is around 3500 meters and is absolutely stunning. This area can have snow well into April and May, high up on the mountains of course. For some cultural tourism do a day trip out to Mar Matti (ancient monestary close to a city called Bardarash), Khenis (2300 year old Assyrian rock relief), Akre (an ancient city which has houses cascading up the mountain), Lalish (Azdi's most important temple), Jerwan (part of the oldest aqueduct in the world which brought water from close to Sheikhan down to the Nineveh plains, new theories suggest that the Gardens of Babylon could have actually been in Nineveh and not Babylon due to this aqueduct), then head over to Al Qosh, another ancient monestary, and the town itself has a ruined synagogue as there were relatively large Jewish communities in Kurdistan. Then spend the night in Duhok. Next day head out to the mountains above Duhok, head to Gara mountain where the ruins of Saddams old palace are, then down to the ancient city of Amediya which lies on a natural citadel. You can then drive through the Barzan region, obviously where the Barzani's are from. In that area you're surrounded by huge gorgeous mountains. You can visit Shanidar cave where archeologists in the 1950's found Neaderthal skeletons which date back to over 60,000 years ago. Then head up to Gali Ali Beg, Bekhal, Korek Mountain, Rawanduz Gorge. Head over to Sulai to get some culture and less of a deserty city. Tons of things to do around that area, like take a visit at Dukan Lake where you can take boat rides to some great swimming spots. You can head south to Halabja, hit up Hawraman area, maybe Darbandikhan Lake. Lots of things to do around here you just need to know someone who knows how to get around and its completely safe."

If you head west you can get into Amediya, Gara Mountain, Meteen Mountain range, Chelke villages.

There are bars that serve alcohol (I've been in a couple). In some restaurants you can get Uzi (which is alcohol). I would say it depends where you go, as some cities are more conservative than others. Some people also say they don't drink, but will secretly have a drink or a couple of beers with you if you tell them straight up you don't give a fuck and drink alcohol. However, I've never personally seen anyone get shit faced and vomit all over the place or being publicly drunk. I would say drinking is more of a private thing you do with close friends. Or Christians. Or sometimes at a restaurant."

I would say drinking is more of a private thing you do with close friends. Or Christians. Or sometimes at a restaurant.   Ironically really, because that is the other end of the spectrum, being extreme in the opposite way, as we have those who do not tolerate a drop of alcohol and prevent others from drinking too, then those who get drunk that they are vomiting in the streets, being anti social, abusive and violent which affects others in that process.  It's like this in almost everything.. If only Humans could actually be good at finding a balance in everything. Religion, politics, it's either one end of the extreme."

kurdistan,3bpymv,IAssassinII,3,Wed Jul 1 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"PKK was created as a reaction to Turkish oppression: massacres, forced assimilation by separating kurdish children from their families, banning of Kurdish language and culture and much more.   I do not condone the killings of civilians, and sadly this did happen with the PKK. However, when you look at all the shit the Turkish government put Kurds through, it's difficult to judge. Who knows what you would've done if your children were kidnapped from you and half of your family massacred?   Kurds don't like to be fucked with, and they will not hesitate to pick up arms and fuck your shit up if you rub them the wrong way. As it should be. Nevertheless, PKK went too far. Especially at the beginning in the 80's and early 90's. You also shouldn't forget that every time something happened, the Turkish media would blow it out of proportion and push it on the PKK, even if they didn't do it. So it's difficult to know exactly what they did or not, but generally speaking they did some fucked up shit regardless. Some consider them heroes because they defended the Kurdish cause, others (the Turks) consider them terrorists because they blew shit up and were ultra left wing. Generally speaking, they are pegged as a terrorist organization by the West to please Turkey, and also because PKK used to be Marxist Leninist.   Edit: Peshmarga are Kurdish warriors. It's a term that is specifically used to designate the ones defending the KRG (at least in Western media, but you can hear that term being used other places). They are not considered terrorists and are highly regarded and respected by everyone, even the Turks."

This whole situation sucks because the US needs to prevent Russia from gaining access to warm water ports and so we need Turkey as an ally, but at the same time, people are being slaughtered by ISIS and coming under threat from the Turkish government. Honestly, I say we hang up our concerns about global politics, at least for a while, because balance of power shouldn't be more important than people's lives."
kurdistan,3bpymv,FeyliXan,3,Thu Jul 2 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"You're most welcome. With the Turkish people, it really depends who you are talking to. Some recognize the shit that happened and are really sorry for it. Usually those are leftists, or more open minded or educated people, for example they travelled or live in a big city. Others are complete motherfuckers who would still call us ""Turks from the mountains"" as Ataturk put it. Usually those are rednecks, less educated, more conservative people or nationalists.   I couldn't agree more with the geopolitical situation. But it also stems from an interior political situation also. Obama is being a complete asshole regarding the Kurdish issue, he absolutely wants the weapons to transit through Baghdad. He is so hung up on trying to keep Iraq united as a country, when it is just impossible to do so. But you know what happens with weapons in the Iraqi army... Those fucks keep all the weapons instead of giving them to us, shit their pants, run away and the equipment ends up in the hands of the goatfuckers ISIS. Basically, the US is currently indirectly giving weapons to the assfucked sons of bitches, and preventing us from exterminating them because we have old ass AKs from the Soviet era. Republicans are generally speaking more supportive. So we'll see how it plays out in next elections, maybe we can get the appropriate weaponry to erase those fucks from the face of the Earth once and for all."

I actually wrote a letter to Obama when is was 12 years old (which was of course directed to someone way down on the chain of command to read (or throw away)), urging him not to pull out of Iraq so soon.

Sort of.  Barely.  Not really.  More PKK cooperating with PUK Peshmerga, while KDP trying to figure out how it can use its offer of cooperation to get influence in Rojava for its affiliated parties in the KNC.  Meanwhile the Rojava Peshmerga (KDP affiliated) guard the Mosul dam in Iraq.   KDP did send some Peshmerga with heavy weapons late in the ISIS-seige of Kobane, but those folks are no longer fighting with the YPG.    The best option for collaboration is in Sinjar/Sengal where there are: Rojavan YPG/YPJ, Bakur PKK, Yezidi YBS/YPG-Sinjar, PUK Peshmerga and KDP Peshmerga... there was also an independent Yezidi militia--the HPS--that the KDP forced to dissolve into the Peshmerga through threats, arrests and probably bribery.  Right now, the liberation of Sengal seems to be waiting some kind of agreement/decision by KRG to proceed.   Throughout Bashur, there are Bakur PKK, PUK Peshmerga, KDP Peshmerga.  Particularly there are Bakur PKK at Kirkuk and Mexmur (which has a large Bakur Kurdish refugee camp).

kurdistan,3bpymv,AmstelLight,2,Fri Jul 3 21:34:10 2015 UTC,"Thats a complex question.  The PKK isn't allowed by law to legally participate in electoral politics.  However, the PKK is quite popular among folks in southeastern Turkey.  There have been several electoral parties with similar politics to the PKK.  The Turkish state typically bans them after a few years with accusations that the party in question is tied to the PKK.    The HDP was formed from a coalition of parties including the Barış ve Demokrasi Partisi (BDP).  The BDP succeeded the Demokratik Toplum Partisiy (DTP) in 2008, following the closure of the latter party for its alleged connections with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).  DTP came out of the Demokratik Halk Partisi (DEHAP).  DEHAP came out of Halkın Demokrasi Partisi(HADEP). HADEP was banned in 2003 on the grounds that it allegedly supported the PKK.  HDP is a secular, democratic socialist, anti-capitalist, feminist, multi-ethnic, pro-Kurd, pro-LGBT electoral party that advoates a peace process where the PKK will disarm in Turkey.  Its politics are very similar to that of the PKK if the PKK had an electoral party.  HDP is supportive of Rojava.  Abdullah Öcalan is the ideological leader of the PKK (and the KCK and all related parties like the PYD in Syria).  Abdullah Öcalan's niece--Dilek Öcalan--just took a seat in Turkish parliament as a member of the HDP.  When Turkey allows Abdullah Öcalan to speak, he usually does so through a meeting with HDP representatives.   When Abdullah Öcalan is publishing a book, he is handing the manuscript to folks in the HDP.   While the HDP doesn't officially identify as Öcalanist, they are very involved in the process which Öcalan transmits his ideas.  If the PKK was legally allowed to have an electoral party, it would probably look very much like the HDP.  The HDP might have broader support and appeal than the PKK would have.    While individual members of the HDP may or may not be sympathizers with the PKK, none of them could legally be actual members of the PKK.  Some of the voters for the HDP in the last election probably are PKK sympathizers and/or members.  There are also probably HDP members/voters who are opposed to the armed struggle the PKK/HPG has waged as a matter of principle--and who would never join the PKK or support its armed struggle."

kurdistan,3bpppn,che899,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:11 2015 UTC,"I don't see the point of looking at genes when talking about identity. Any Kurd can have Kurdish genes while his/her neighbour can have other genes (because his family migrated hundreds of years ago) and you both can still view yourselves as Kurds. For me identity works in a different way: do you view yourself as Kurdish, do you identify yourself with Kurdish culture and the Kurdish people, etc. I think most Zaza's consider themselves Kurdish (and on Wikipedia there are many sources for this).  And I think what others are saying is correct, Zazaki is related to Gorani."

I think feeling Kurdish is more important than having Kurdish ancestors you never knew. It's like Americans saying I'm part Polish and part Italian, while they consider themselves American. The last part is much more important.  But since it's important to you, like others here already said, Zaza's and Zazaki are definitely closely related to Kurds and Gorani.

Zazaki and Gorani are linguistically not Kurdish, allthough pretty much everyone who speaks either language considers him/herself a Kurd. Anthropologists are still not sure whether racially/ethnically Zazaki and Gorani speakers are Kurds or not. Some suggest that they're just Kurds who have picked up a different language, others suggest they're not Kurds at all, some suggest that they're Dailamites, but also assert that Dailamites are a Median tribe, making them Kurdish too, and then you have those who suggest that they're Dailamites but not Kurdish or Median.

Zazas have historically been designated as Kurds, and are culturally and genetically nearly identitical.   Zazas are thought to descend from Daylamites, but that theory is not without its discrepancies. First, one reason for their supposed connection is between 'Dimli' and 'Daylam', but historically, most Zaza groups didn't even know the term Dimli. Depending on the region, they called themselves Kirmanc, Dimli, Zaza... Second, though Daylamites did settle in small numbers in different places, I do not know of any large-scale immigration to the prominent Zaza regions (Dêrsim and neighbouring areas). Third, Zazas do not cluster with North Iranians. That does not preclude an outside elite having imposed its language on locals, of course."

Dêrsimis are probably the Kurds with the most genetically tested so far, and the Armenian ancestry, although present in a few, is not at all as extensive as some believe.   I once heard of an Armenian priest who alleged that 80% of Dêrsim was Armenian-descended, which is ridiculous of course. Some Turkish researchers seem to think that Kurdish Alevis are either Turkmen-descended, or Armenian-descended, both are wrong."

kurdistan,3bpppn,Znertu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:33:14 2015 UTC,"Sure.   In a paper on Y-DNA and MtDNA (respectively father and mother lines) in different Kurdish groups, the following conclusion was made:  ""Genetically, it turned out that Zazaki speakers overall group quite closely with other Kurdish groups, and with their geographic neighbours from the South Caucasus for mtDNA, and with Kurmanji-T for the Y-SNP haplogroups. The previous hypothesis of a close relationship of the Zaza people to populations from northern Iran (MacKenzie, 1962) therefore does not gain genetic support, although the genetic evidence of course does not preclude a northern Iranian origin for the Zazaki language itself.""

kurdistan,3bfwir,iwillruletheuniverse,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any problem taking a bus from Istanbul through Ankara to Diyarbakır, and then another bus to Silopi, on the Iraqi Kurdistan border. I then took a taxi across the border (that was helpful, as my Kurdish taxi driver knew the ins and outs of the Turkish border procedure) and then ended up on the other side in Zakho. From there, it was easy to find a bus to Dohuk and then to Arbil. And being that Arbil is the capital, there are lots of buses going all over the country.   The only thing I'd be weary of is that when I took the Arbil-Suleymaniah bus, it went through Kirkuk, which at the time (2006) was kind of a warzone. Apparently there are also direct buses from Arbil to Suleymaniah, but then again, with Kirkuk in Kurdish hands, it's also probably quite safe."

Rojava, like Kurdistan must increase development 50x faster than normal and compared to its neighbours. A good term used, I actually read here was going warp speed compared to others... That's how fast Kurdistan must develop.. You shouldn't be blocking ""big corporations"" but creating a system that allows for a balance of very fast development and at the same time regulation to prevent them from taking advantage or corruption, that's the failure of why ""big corporations"" always get the bad rep, because they (the hosts) fail to keep a grip on the actions of the ""investors"".  For example if a corporation wants to come in and build a water supply infrastructure - going for the cheapest offer or one with rather a silly unrelated ""gift"" than the most reliable option and future prepared one is a good example. Or another example is when a company bid on building a highway/long road, or any other project, the idea is to go with a reliable, good reputation one that you know will build a good road, rather than the most cheapest option or one with a catch or condition that later creates a problem in the future.

Minor Turkic groups include the Turkmen and the Qashqai peoples.

kurdistan,3awqs5,FeyliXan,7,Wed Jun 24 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"my mother told me everybody became way more religious than they used to be when she grew up in Iraq (she is 60 years old, if that helps). For example, she told me that before, if Muslims didn't do Ramadan, it wasn't seen too negatively, but now it is.   Maybe not that extreme as in Iraq, but the same happened in Turkey. My father once told me that the people in Turkey weren't that religious back in the days (60s,70s) as today. I can't tell you the exact reasons for that, but I guess, it has something to do with the rise of Islamism in general (Islamic Revolution in Iran, Spread of Saudi Wahhabism, The founding of multiple Islamist Organizations, etc.). These things certainly influenced the entire Middle East.    Kurds are as a majority secular   Why do so many people here keep repeating this nonsense? Most Kurds, including everyone else in the Middle East, aren't secular. Maybe it seems to you, because you don't even live there, but saying most Kurds are secular is simply not true, and is just repressing/ignoring the real problems the Kurds have (Tribalism, Religious Conservatism, etc)"

Kurds did face discrimination but Iraq was much more stable.   My theory: As Iraq plummeted into conflict after conflict the country became less stable. People face uncertainty, anxiety and disorder. This leads many to look beyond governments and turn to religion for order and certainty. Of course there's is always someone taking in to the extreme and making it their job to tell everyone else how to live (ignoring that judging other people is also a sin). This isn't the majority so don't be fooled by a vocal minority, gossiping is a Kurdish national hobby it seems.   Men being disrespectful towards women is the result of failed education and heavy urbanization, not religion (women are often more religious than men).   I don't see people becoming more devout as a problem. They just need to stop meddling in each others affairs."
kurdistan,3awqs5,Chocksnopp,2,Wed Jun 24 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"In Iraq, the Ba'athists deliberately emphasized secularism, women's rights, etc... but after the Iraq-Iran war, Saddam Hussein reversed those positions and tried to bolster support for the regime through increasing religiosity.    I'm not saying its the only factor of the growth of religiosity and decline of feminism Iraq (and Bashur) but that likely was a factor.  ""The Ba'ath formed the General Federation of Iraqi Women in 1969. The GFIW, through its control of 250 rural and urban communities, offered job training, education, and other social programs to women. The GFIW was also the only legal channel through which women could lobby for reforms in regard to their status under the law and personal status code. By 1997, 47% of all Iraqi women were members of the GFIW. Many women still criticized the GFIW as a propaganda arm of the state.  Advances in women's rights continued under the Ba'ath regime into the 1980s, with women gaining the right to stand for election in parliament and local government. Education became mandatory for girls, and literacy programs became available for adults—by 1987, 75% of Iraqi women were literate. Women could join the large civil service workforce, where laws were established for equal pay for equal work, maternity benefits, and freedom from harassment.  During the Iraq-Iran war, the participation of women in the civil service workforce soared to 70%. Yet, the government also banned contraception. With the end of the Iraq-Iran war and the failure to hold Kuwait with the Gulf War, women were displaced from employment by the demobilization of male Iraqi soldiers. Saddam Hussein's adoption of Islamization further eroded gains made by women. In 1990, men were exempted from prosecution for ""honor killings"". Hussein's ""Campaign for Faithfulness"", supposedly against prostitution, was used to behead political opponents and doctors.  By 1998, all women working as secretaries for government agencies were dismissed; by 2000, restrictions were placed on women working outside the home; travel abroad by women became restricted, co-ed education was eliminated, and the female literacy dropped to 25%. In the nominally independent Kurdish area to the north, where the ICP and WCPI could operate openly, there was still a deterioration of women's rights, with increasing honor killings and women being driven out of workplaces and universities.  Women also suffered greatly from increasing mortality and malnutrition under the difficulties resulting from the U.S.-supported economic sanctions against Iraq. The U.S. Occupation policy of de-Ba'athification abolished the GFIW."" http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/peopleaposs-history-iraq"

kurdistan,3atcj8,ihsw,3,Tue Jun 23 15:31:11 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean ""cede Kerkuk"", not Mosul? Gaining Mosul would not be advantageous for the KRG, or Kurds in general. Why would the KRG even want Mosul?"
kurdistan,3atcj8,beyw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:45:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, it should be assumed that Kirkuk will belong to the KRG, however the fate of Mosul is up in the air.  It will be so large and it will be such a protracted operation that the KRG has no choice but to be involved in the siege and liberation of Mosul, and they will not be involved unless they can administer it independently of Iraqi oversight/meddling."
kurdistan,3atcj8,ihsw,2,Tue Jun 23 16:18:10 2015 UTC,"Why would the KRG even want Mosul? Sure, the KRG will be involved in the liberation of Mosul, but there are no motives for them to want to administer it. Isn't it significantly populated by Arabs? There can't be many Kurds at all living there."
kurdistan,3atcj8,beyw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:46 2015 UTC,"There used to be a lot, 1/3 of it at least. People can slowly return and those displaced arabs in KRG can have a place to go and still be protected by the KRG, where they fled to.. And tell us why Kurds can't administrate a majority arab city?"
kurdistan,3atcj8,Axa2000,2,Tue Jun 23 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"1/3 is a small amount, not enough to justify Mosul being under Kurdish jurisdiction. It should be over 50% in my opinion, if we don't plan on deporting people (not that it would happen).   Secondly, it's not a question of capability, but rather a question of rights. Should the KRG have a right to govern Mosul? IMO, no. It is an Arab city, and has always been. Mosul is no way shape or form related to Kurdistan or Kurdish anything. We could just as well be speaking about Aleppo, because it's the same scenario. YPG wanting to control Aleppo would be ridiculous to say the least.  And controlling Mosul would be like controlling Kerkuk times 5 or something. A lot more instability, more resistance. Believe it or not, Arabs don't want to live under non-Arabic rule. Unnecessarily expanding will only make us more hated, we should learn from Israel."
kurdistan,3atcj8,beyw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:47:44 2015 UTC,"Well 1/3 of a city with a population of about a million is a large amount actually and that doesn't mean the other 2/3 of it is/was arabs - rather 1/3 of it is other ethnicities other than arabs so it's a fairly balanced mix.. If it means a well governed and administrated place that respects all ethnicities and creeds, then what's your problem exactly with that? Kurds don't want to live under arabs, but has that stopped arabs from forcing that on them?  I understand one of your concerns is that the Kurds might have difficulty with it, but I'm imagining that it's done right and the people there are happy with the Kurds running it..  Just like for example that hasn't stopped arabs fleeing from ISIS into KRG, I guess they don't mind it then do they, as long as they get the safety? So if Mosul is in KRG control, what's the difference?  Also think about what you're saying.. Kurds have been living and being governed by arabs, turks etc for many years and it's been miserable, yet they have no issues with that so if they're fine with it, they are fine with it being the opposite. They object to ANY place the Kurds declare as being their own to administrate themselves, and when Kurds seek independence they strongly oppose it they don't care about ""rights"" and the massive difference is Kurds will actually do it right. - that's my belief.  In return we get a city that gives Kurdistan a little more protection, rather than the current stretch of defences we have to have around Mosul because of not controlling it.. It's not really a big deal, but I think makes things easier."

kurdistan,3atcj8,viglen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:31:42 2015 UTC,"Well actually I disagree, look at Tal Abyad / Gire Spi, it was held by ISIS for years and they've had enough of the way ISIS treated them when the YPG entered along with FSA it seems to be fine, the same I think will be the case in Mosul, they are probably regretting it a lot. If the Kurds go in, respect and give equal rights to the arabs, repopulate with Kurds and such, allow people to live in peace and most importantly kick out any ISIS supporters, the place will be secure.. If they are happy to run into KRG than live with ISIS, then there is hope they will do the same in Mosul.  Secondly, if you look at the front lines to Mosul, all directions Peshmerga must defend, that's a lot of front lines to hold, if you take the shorter distance, defending Mosul from outside threat is probably the easer option than around the entire Mosul outside.  Anyway, this is just us talking, the Peshmerga and KRG know what's best and hopefully they do what's best and what's right."

Kurdistan has many eyes watching and they're all eager to push their influences inside Kurdistan with funding their own political parties or setting up news media pushing their agendas for example.. The Saudi cables shows that they funded some Kurdish parties for their own agendas.. A president system will ensure the president can make critical decisions and move them quickly when needed. If the Kurdish people can judge correctly who they give this sort of power, then it's the best thing possible.   The President shall be elected in parliament through secret ballots and requiring two-third of the votes.   That's nice.. Why and who does it benefit for it to be secret..  These guys need to stop writing in a tone that desperately tries to act like Kurdistan is dictatorship run by a mafia boss, just because they dislike Masoud Barzani... I know these are opinion pieces, but seriously it just looks unprofessional.. And it's hurting Kurdistan.. People like Michael Rubin go and lobby this bullshit and convince people that the KRG shouldn't be supported. There was a parliament vote and he won it.. That is democracy... All those people in the parliament represent Kurds inside Kurdistan.. If it was legit, which they claim wasn't but provide no sources or evidence of it, then they honestly are talking shit and have an agenda.. This is the same website that constantly pushes Michael Rubin articles, I honestly don't trust these guys have positive interests for Kurdistan, but rather they focus on their own political agendas, and the way they constantly bash the parliament vote which was to extend Masoud Barzani post is kind of pathetic. In reality the parliament was desperate to find someone with the kind of work Barzani did while he was in position and they found nobody..   Churchill was never voted into office, for example.. He was chosen by a secret committee just after the prime minster resigned.. The prime minster was within this committee, I believe. After the war was over Churchill failed to win the elections even though he was part of winning the war.. When Tony Blair stepped down, Gordon Brown automatically took Prime Minster position without any vote from the people, but rather a vote within the party..

But I think it's something about:   In August 2011, it was alleged that he had been captured by Iranian forces, a claim denied by both Iran and the PKK. Nevertheless this led to many conspiracy theories about how Karayılan was released by Iranian forces, proving his alleged links to Iran.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_cross-border_raids#Alleged_Capture_of_Murat_Karay.C4.B1lan   Turkish interior minister İdris Naim Şahin said the news confused Murat Karayılan with PJAK commander Murat Karasac,[26][34] who had been killed by Iranian forces in West Azerbaijan on August 2.[35]   Nonetheless this has led to many conspiracy theories in the media, for instance by Today's Zaman columnist Markar Esayan, that Iran was trying to help Cemil Bayik execute an internal coup in the PKK by capturing Karayılan, so that Iran can gain influence over the organisation.

Would the US just let that happen? Fuck no! The U.S. is actively helping bomb ISIS targets with YPG/J ground forces.. To imagine that while that's happening, the Americans hear that their ground force is busy fighting the Turks and can't take on ISIS anymore, and then because of that ISIS take more Kurdish areas and mass amounts of civilians die, the news would be showing how the U.S. is losing against ISIS .. If there's also U.S. troops on the ground helping with the targeting that also means those troops are at risk.. You just right there fucked massively with U.S. interests.. You think the U.S. is going to even remotely let this happen? It would be insane to think that without a deal with the U.S. turkey would be allowed to encroach on U.S. Simply not going to happen any time soon at least, but if you see the U.S. moving away from the YPG, then you can be worried..  Also what about Kurds in Turkey, it reached a point where every Kurdish city/town was in riots because Kobane was at risk of falling.. The Kurds in Turkey got super pissed.. Now think about their reactions to an invasion of Turkish forces into Rojava, it would be out-right civil war, lets say 15 million Kurds, 50% of them are male, 50% of that is fighting age, lets say 3 million Kurds revolting..

Early on the in the conflict, before Erbil was threatened by Isil, the Kurds maintained a position of neutrality. That backfired badly as it resulted in Isil marching full-speed towards Erbil after capturing Kirkuk.

Kurds have no interest in ruling over huge Arab lands (except maybe for what's in between so Rojava is connected). They are no threat to him. If not, he will have to defeat the YPG because they will definitely not leave. Assad (Sr. and Jr.) have always treated Kurds very badly in Syria and nobody has forgotten that.  If Al Nusra wins it will be war probably. Nusra and the Kurds have fought multiple times these last few years and they have completely different goals. Nusra sees the YPG as non-religious Western puppets while it wants sharia law for entire Syria.  FSA is too hard to tell. It's a weird mixture of a lot of groups. There are already FSA units fighting with the Kurds against ISIS but there are also units fighting with Al Nusra I believe. Don't think they have one command to be honest. It depends on which side of them will get the leadership."

It depends where you're from and that will determine how hard it will be to learn the dialect. A Iranian would be better off learning Sorani, as the alphabet and language is similar to eachother.   I'd personally recommend Kurmanji if you're not from the middle east which uses the latin alphabet with some additions but most important because, it doesn't require you to read Kurdî/Sorani alphabet (Which by the way looks like this).  Here you can see that the majority of the Kurdish population speaks Kurmanji. Read through this to get an overview understanding & here is a useful lexicon if you'd need it.   what literature do you recommend as a good introduction to Kurdish history?   As for this, I love to visit the library in Slemani and read, and there are quite a few books that I'd like to share, but since you don't read Kurdî, you'd have little use of it. Here is a recently written article about our war situation, which I really liked because of it's in-depth explanation & fancy CGI. Maybe you could check out Stephen Mansfield's ""The Miracle of the Kurds, here. I haven't read it but it's apparently a good read.  Good luck. It really isn't that hard to learn Kurdish, no matter which dialect if you put some time into it."
kurdistan,39qoux,Schweinii,2,Sat Jun 13 21:31:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering.  I actually am from the ME, but I assume Sorani would still be difficult since, being Israeli, I'm not too familiar with reading and writing Arabic and Arabized alphabets.   Are Kurmanji and Sorani intelligible to each other?   From my limited understanding, since Kurmanji is spoken in the North, in the area abutting Turkey and Syria, the PKK and YPG probably speak it.  Likewise , the KRG and  the Peshmerga forces currently fighting Daesh in Northern Iraq probably speak Sorani.   Are these assumptions correct? Knowing would help me decide which direction to take my studies."

Other schools of anarchist thought are too anti-organisation to ever have a chance at succeeding at revolution.

The YPG let's you know right away they will not pay you during the time you volunteer with them.

Then the YPG can bring their Euphrates Volcano and other FSA allies to the east.  They'll also pressure SAA in the area to defect.  The artillery and position Hasakah is a strong one.  Daesh haven't has much luck cracking it.  Further, the YPG wants the support of the local Arab community there, so ideally they'd have that support before trying to dislodge the SAA/NDF.    Also, if the YPG directly attacks the SAA, Sheikh Maqsood in Aleppo could expect SAA airforce attacks.   Since the SAA isn't attacking the YPG I earnest right now, Tev-Dem will probably stick with a diplomatic approach.  That might change after YPG takes Tel Abyad, Sinjar and Azaz."
kurdistan,39n6aj,flintsparc,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"The bullshit reasons the PYD gives for not getting rid of the regime forces left in Rojava is because they don't want to be barrel bombed in retaliation and because they have ""no need"" for the airport since they have no nationalist/nation-state aspirations. I don't think the Assadists barrel bombing Kurdish areas is realistically ever going to happen even if the YPG leadership finally manned up and kicked the regime to curb with force since that would lead to enormous international condemnation and a probable no-fly zone that would be very damaging for Assad. The real reasons why they let the regime control vast swathes of both Hasakah/Hasakah countryside and Qamishli/Qamishli countryside is because they have extensive behind the scenes ties with the regime since 2011, and to continue using the airport so Kurds can fly from Rojava to Demascus and Aleppo and vice versa.  Regardless it is humiliating that those Ba'athist enclaves still exist in Rojava, as they represent decades of severe oppression against Kurds. That is the problem with TEV-DEM and the YPG. They are both run by out of touch Turkish Kurds who have no problem kissing Ba'athist ass and being subservient to the Assad family as they did it for years before Ocalan was captured. Until the YPG takes the fight to the regime they will never have the support of most Kurds in Syria. They are still hated by large sections of the Syrian Kurdish population who still consider them Kurdish Shabiha for very rarely fighting the regime and oppressing anti-regime Kurds heavily especially in 2011 and 2012. It is disgusting and deeply shameful how the PYD flag is often positioned next to the Syrian Ba'ath flag and Assad posters in Rojava (in particular in Cizire canton)."

If HDP voters were really secular they wouldn't vote AKP in the first place. A party like HDP could've come into parlament years ago, especially if kurds make up around 20 million in turkey then getting 15-20%, let alone 10% would be no problem at all.

I work in an office in London so this isn't a Kurdish thing, I think this is just common sense..   3) people here can be very sensitive to criticism (even constructive)   Just like every other random people.

Also, this one isn't that important but, if you ever realize you're in this situation, be aware of it: If you ever get invited to a house and you're the guest, there are USUALLY several rounds of eating/drinking and it's set up like this:  1) Something to drink (Usually pepsi/juice/water)  2) Sweets serving (Usually Baklawa)  3) Tea serving (Sometimes served at the same time as the sweets)  4) Fruit serving"

kurdistan,38bs6p,squidwurd,4,Wed Jun 3 04:59:10 2015 UTC,Arabic is only spoken by the older generation in South (Iraqi) Kurdistan. So it's the least useful language when traveling through the region.   Farsi is spoken by most people in Eastern (Iranian) Kurdistan and Turkish  by most in North (Turkish) Kurdistan. So I'd choose depending on which one you're likely to visit more.   The bigger cities are more likely to have English speaking residents.
kurdistan,38bs6p,Chamarazan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:37:05 2015 UTC,"It depends where you are going.   If you're going to South Eastern Turkey, learn Turkish. Because most Kurds there do speak Turkish.   Farsi if you go to Iran, and Arabic if you go to Iraq or Syria (but I wouldn't recommend that tho lol)   For all I know they might still speak French.   What? Where did you get this? Generally, Kurds don't speak french, except if they live in France. Nobody in the Middle East speaks french. You're confusing it with North Africa (Algeria, Morocco & Tunisia)"

kurdistan,38707w,che899,2,Tue Jun 2 11:29:54 2015 UTC,"This doesn't only serve AKP's interests, but Turkey's. They're mostly doing it for economic reasons and the economy is Turkey's. not AKP's. And this also has benefits for the Kurds involved. CHP and the KRG would want to continue this. I don't think anything will change. Also, the KRG invited Turkey to dominate the Kurdish economy, Ankara didn't force anything. If stupid politicians were capable of stupid policy once, they can do it another time."

kurdistan,38707w,che899,3,Tue Jun 2 14:23:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I meant 'coalition'. Fucked up the title.  Basically, what he is saying is, that HDP will never make a coalition with AKP, but they can talk about such a thing with CHP. 'The entire Nation wants peace, and even MHP knows and wants this', he also adds.   Question to you Kurds here: What do you guys think about a possible CHP-HDP coalition? Would you support such a thing? It would be stupid, not to support it IMO. A new Centre Left - Social Democratic Turkey, instead of a Right Conservative - Authocratic Turkey."
kurdistan,38707w,modada,3,Tue Jun 2 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"Is that even possible? Just some basic questions: AKP will ask everyone to enter in a coalition with them right? And if nobody agrees (I really doubt it) then the 2nd biggest party gets to try? Do CHP and HDP have enough seats in the polls to form a coalition?   A new Centre Left - Social Democratic Turkey, instead of a Right Conservative - Authocratic Turkey.   I don't think most of us are worried about which turn Turkey will take; liberal, socialist, conservative, whatever. For Turkey it will be probably better if AKP disappears but you came here and asked for the Kurdish view. We're worried about what will happen to Kurdish rights.. whether the HDP gets in (Erdogan's wrath) or not (no political voice)."
kurdistan,38707w,Deadinthehead,4,Tue Jun 2 13:21:19 2015 UTC,All of the parties that have the chance to get into parliment told that they were not going to form a coalition with AKP. We'll wait and see if it is true though.

""It is nobody's business what was inside the trucks. Yes there were serious clashes in Syria and we helped the Turkmens,"" Davutoglu said Sunday in a Haberturk television interview.   Just like how they were trying to ""help"" the Turkmens in Iraq just after the Kurds/Americans cleared northern Iraq, the Turks sent in the same bullshit aid trucks filled with weapons, the American's knew they were coming and bagged them up like terrorists and sent them packing after. Again, just as they tried to do now, these were attempts to tip the balance their way.

kurdistan,37yf9q,Znertu,5,Sun May 31 13:25:15 2015 UTC,I'm on my phone with low battery. Could you give an example out of the poem with such a sentence. I think you mean object instead of subject. I is still the subject. But the correct one is with Min. If you say Ez it sounds like you were eaten. What are you trying to say here? What is the English sentence?
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,4,Sun May 31 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate.   The title itself. 'Kî ne em', shoudn't it be: 'Em kî ne?' Okay, so 'Min xwariye', that's clear. There's a movie called 'Min dît', which coincides with that. I don't know where his book is."
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,6,Sun May 31 14:34:33 2015 UTC,"1- You are right. 9 out 10 ten times it would be Em kî ne. But I can see how Kî ne em could be used. Instead of ""who are we"", I would say this comes over like ""don't you know who we are!?"". Same with em nizanin and nizanin em!? This also fits the poem better.  3- Both of them don't make much sense. The construct his book is missing from your sentences. Ez nizanim kû pirtûk ye wî is right --> I don't know where book of him."
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,3,Sun May 31 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"Alright, didn't know that, thanks.  I see, that makes sense. Can't you say 'pirtûkê wî' for 'his book'? That'd make 'Ez nizanim kû pirtûkê wî ye.'"
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,3,Sun May 31 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"Combining pirtûk and ye to pirtûke is correct. Maybe not in formal writing but people will say this more often on the streets. But don't put ye then again at the end, you already have that word in your sentence then attached to pirtûk.  To make it more difficult: ye wî is correct and means of him, the other way around (wî ye) is incorrect in this context. You could however use it in another way ye wî ye --> it is of him. It (wî ye) is possible here and not in your example because here the first ye is a subject and in yours it isn't.  Or in another context: Ew li nêzik wî ye --> He is close to him.  Ask if you don't understand this :)"
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,3,Sun May 31 15:28:42 2015 UTC,"I see that, but the 'ye' in my sentence denotes 'is', not 'of', and the 'ê' of 'pirtûkê wî' is simply the ezafe. Surely 'pirtûkê wî' means 'his book'?"
kurdistan,37yf9q,che899,3,Sun May 31 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"So if I understand correctly, your question now is: pirtûke wî means his book and you are wondering where the ""is"" is in the sentence?"

kurdistan,37jce8,Messicus,5,Thu May 28 06:33:37 2015 UTC,"Here is a translation by /u/cevvalkoala -  Here is the original statement by the Prime Minister. AA is Pravda of Turkey, so it's official. However, the prime minister did not suggest invading Jerusalem at all. Either the shoebat fella is very creative with translation, or Erdogan's crony translation agency which translated the original article to Arabic for AA did have some fun. Anyway, let me help. First the original text:   ""O zaman, biraz önce Sayın Cumhurbaşkanımızla istişare ettik: Birlik ve kardeşlik deyince akla kim gelir? 'Yüksekova Havalimanı'na öyle bir ad verelim ki Kürtler de Türkler de Araplar da 'işte bizim liderimiz, birlik sembolümüz' desin ve 'Kudüs Yahudilerin kutsal mekanıdır' diyenler de bir kez daha utansın. Yiğit Kürt kardeşlerim, bu toprakların yiğit bacıları, inşallah havalimanına bu mesajı vermek için, birlik ve kardeşlik mesajını vermek için ve 'Kudüs ebediyyen Kürtlerindir, Türklerindir, Araplarındır, Müslümanlarındır' demek için bu havalimanına Selahaddin Eyyubi adını veriyoruz. Eminim o büyük komutan o büyük alim, ordusunda bütün Ortadoğu halklarını bir araya getirerek Haçlıları dize getiren o büyük alim, manen şu anda bize şahitlik ediyordur. Ben onun manevi huzurunda, ona hitaben diyorum ki 'Hakkarili, Yüksekovalı, Çukurcalı, Şemdinlili yiğitler, Doğulu, Güneydoğulu yiğitler, Anadolulu yiğitler bütün Türkiye sana söz veriyor ey Selahaddin Eyyubi... Sen nasıl Ortadoğu coğrafyasını kardeş kılmışsan biz de kardeş kılacağız. Sen nasıl 'Kudüs Haçlıların değildir' dediysen biz de sen şahit ol, Allah şahit olsun, 'Kudüs İsrail'in değil, Müslümanlarındır' demeye devam edeceğiz. Mescid-i Aksa'ya postallarla girenlerle dost olmadık, olmayacağız. 'Kudüs Yahudilerin mekanıdır' diyenlerle dost olmadık, olmayacağız.""   And here's my (albeit not official) translation:   ""Then we consulted with Mr. President, and asked ourselves who would represent unity and fraternity best? Let us name 'Yuksekova Airport' after such a person, that Kurds, Turks, and Arabs think of as 'our leader, our symbol of unity', and who would put those who claim 'Jerusalem is the holy land of Jews' in shame once again. My brave Kurdish brothers, the brave sisters of these lands; We hereby name this airport after Saladin, in order to convey this message, this message of unity and fraternity, and to state once again 'for eternity, Jerusalem will belong to Kurds, Turks, Arabs, Muslims.' I'm sure that great commander, that great scholar, the great scholar who brought together all the peoples of the Middle East and brought the Crusaders down, is here with us, in spirit. In his spiritual presence, I address him: 'The brave people of Hakkari, Yuksekova, Cukurca, Semdinli; the brave people of the Eastern and Southeastern Turkey; the brave people of Anatolia; the whole Turkey promises this before you great Saladin... Just like you made the Middle East a land of fraternity, we will also bring that fraternity. Just like you said 'Jerusalem does not belong to the Crusaders', be my witness, let God be my witness, we will continue to say 'Jerusalem does not belong to Israel; it belongs to Muslims'. We have never befriended and we will never befriend those who violated Al Aqsa with their boots. We have never befriended and we will never befriend those who said 'Jerusalem is the land of Jews'.   So no invading jerusalem and no global islamic empire. In my personal opinion, it's a slightly feverish denouncement of the annexation of Jerusalem, and a call for harmony between Kurds and Turks, and not much more.  *edit - Thanks /u/cevvalkoala for this!  Credit where credit is due."
kurdistan,37jce8,ParevArev,2,Thu May 28 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"He literally said ""jerusalem belongs to muslims only, not jews. Then he proceeded to bring up Saladin, the head of a caliphate which conquered jerusalem, and blatantly said he wishes for this to happen again? Even from your translation it was clear what he was talking about."

Almost all the Arabs and Kurds you'll meet also speak Turkish fluently, so Turkish will be the biggest bang for your buck (and few good resources exist for kurmanci)  This is a very good program, I'd recommend completing it before you go: http://kat.cr/pimsleur-turkish-i-30-lessons-t4320893.html  Duolingo now also has a Turkish for English speakers module.

As a foreigner you have nothing to be afraid of.  And it will be the hottest times of the year. Like 40+ C degrees.  Also when you are in border cities try to stay in the city centers.  I will ask my friends in the region and add more information! :)

At least the heat will not be a big problem since here in my town in the summer face temperature up to 42 degrees (and in the winter  we have snow sometimes).  In the border region the only place I want to get away from the center is Harran. It seems to me that much worth the risk :)

kurdistan,37g4kq,Rostamy-Zal,3,Wed May 27 12:40:22 2015 UTC,Having a separate Kurdistan is way more realistic than living in a peaceful Turkey
kurdistan,37g4kq,Sruda,9,Sat May 30 10:06:50 2015 UTC,"Turkey hasn't given us equal rights since the country was created and I don't expect them to do it any time soon. So no, ""live in peace"" is only in the advantage of the oppressor."
kurdistan,37g4kq,che899,2,Wed May 27 16:36:05 2015 UTC,"Well, education in Kurdish language would be one thing. From primary school to secondary school to university. Education in one's language is a basic human right."
kurdistan,37g4kq,che899,2,Thu May 28 21:29:11 2015 UTC,"What kind of comparison is that? Kurds in Turkey are not migrants. And yes it actually is a right to be educated in one's language. Even if the state doesn't want to do it, it should not block it.  Edit: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_rights#Assimilation-oriented_vs._maintenance-oriented.5B1.5D"
kurdistan,37g4kq,che899,2,Thu May 28 21:36:57 2015 UTC,"You know that the ban on speaking Kurdish is long gone.   In theory yes. But just look how long it took to come with a Kurdish Qur'an. And still, I'm not talking about a ban. I'm talking about providing or at least allowing education in the mother tongue.   It's not a matter of migrants vs locals, it's a matter of official state languages.   Just the fact that Kurdish, which is spoken by millions, is not even recognized as a minority language says it all.   If you tried to instutionally defy the state language on the same scale in the Netherlands, for example, you would see just how understanding they are of that 'right.'   And I did! I had Frisian in my secondary school, a language that is barely spoken but the Netherlands protects it."

kurdistan,37g4kq,beyw,6,Thu May 28 21:59:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not Kurdish, but I've always thought that the quickest way to a borderless world is to first establish our borders. The middle east, including Turkey, wasn't divided by the people living there. It was divided by France and Britain. The kurds need their own country. From there we can build to a better, stronger, Middle East."
kurdistan,37g4kq,greydalf_the_gan,4,Thu May 28 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"The middle east, including Turkey, wasn't divided by the people living there. It was divided by France and Britain.   Not quite true. Yes they play a part in the history, but people there held onto it and also changed it slightly to suit themselves. For example the allies drew what was meant to be Kurdistan, but the Turks wrote that off completely and the allies were not in a position to disagree as the ones who came out on top were the ones influencing the treaties. WW1 and WW2 were the causes of treaties being rewritten. Just after WW2 nobody wanted to start wars, at least the Europeans.  But forget all that. In no way are they [the allies] responsible now. That way of thinking is agenda driven and excuses the actions after. The greed, the hatred of others is the root cause of why those borders still exist to this day. You can not blame another person for your own stubbornness and greed to not give away what you very well know is other peoples home-land. The Kurds do not want to be Turkish, Syrian, Iraqi or Iranian.. This question about living in peace with Turks or getting a Kurdistan and not being in peace with Turks????? Why the fuck can't Turks simply live in peace without forcing their shit on other people."

Middle and upper class, predominately white, and usually pre-occupied with inane pop culture garbage, and the social media protest of the day. They're mostly selfish and focused on their own little rich white people problems like how video games oppress them. Very little understanding of international issues or solidarity with women. It's not a serious movement."
kurdistan,37cljq,NovaObscura,2,Wed May 27 03:36:04 2015 UTC,feminism and women's liberation   I think it is a good thing that Kurdistan is a beacon of light here and maybe influence it's neighbors in social equality. Just wish Middle East can get back on it's feet without wars.
kurdistan,37dlsr,DrRustle,6,Tue May 26 21:19:18 2015 UTC,"Is there no chance of a coalition with HDP?  I ask as an outsider, I've never been to Turkey and only know what I've read."
kurdistan,37dlsr,xian16,1 point,Wed May 27 02:36:33 2015 UTC,Almost none.
kurdistan,37dlsr,modada,5,Wed May 27 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the AKP getting just enough to govern alone.    Why? This can't end well.   Also, Bahceli clearly stated that he won't make a coalition with AKP. Nobody wants a coalition with AKP these days. The only party that would be willing to form a coalition with AKP is HDP. This is what most people are afraid of.    I hope CHP gets ~30%, MHP close to 20% and HDP passes the threshold.   I really don't understand why so many Kurds here still want AKP to govern and are so much afraid of CHP. We can't get rid of Erdogan if we still have the same old mentality."
kurdistan,37dlsr,Ashihna,6,Wed May 27 10:03:58 2015 UTC,"Well, Demirtas also stated he won't get into a coalition with AKP. Thing is, after the election these words from him and Bahceli mean little and if opportunity arises things could change. And if you then look at ideologies and programmes, you'll see that MHP is the closest to AKP. Erdogan team tagging with HDP would piss of his nationalist voter base. So I see two things happen if AKP can't govern alone; coalition with MHP or new elections.  For a lot of Kurds Erdogan is bad, but not the worst. It wasn't the Islamists that oppressed the Kurds since 1923, it were the Kemalists. And tho the latter have changed, trust is easily lost and difficult to (re)gain. However, Kilicdaroglu style of leadership does give some hope for the future and I hope he stays the leader of the CHP and continues to modernize it."
kurdistan,37dlsr,idontIikecats,7,Wed May 27 10:39:44 2015 UTC,"As a Turk. Hopefully, the CHP gets 30%, MHP 10% and the HDP gets over 10%. That way Erdogan can't turn Turkey into a Presidential/Dictatorship. I wanted to vote HDP but I worried they won't get past 10% and I would feel like I wasted my vote."
kurdistan,37dlsr,Lebensunwertesleben,-5,Wed May 27 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"I hope HDP gets 9,99999999999 but not 10. This way they'll get financing since they'll be above 7%.   CHP/MHP (same shit, chp is as nationalist as mhp if not more) aren't any better for democracy in Turkey than AKP.  Same shit different color.   I hate that there'll be a lot Kurd hating chauvinist assholes voting for HDP. It disgusts me.  let me show my point from an actual CHP supporter who will be voting for HDP, and I quote;  ""If HDP can't pass the threshold, AKP will get enough MPs to do whatever they want. That's not the future I want for Turkey. That's why I'm voting for HDP, not because they are a minority.  HDP doesn't want have peaceful intentions. I realize that.  HDP can't conquer Southeastern Turkey (he is referring to Northern Kurdistan) with a 10% vote. They can't empower PKK with a 10% vote. They can't damage Turkey's future and prosperity with a 10% vote.  But they can lower AKP's votes and this could result in a CHP+MHP coalition.  I'd rather fight a terrorist organization (he is referring to HDP and Kurds) than a government in the end. ""  make no mistake, these guys are worse than AKP."
kurdistan,37dlsr,idontIikecats,5,Wed May 27 02:54:01 2015 UTC,"Mate your using comments from reddit as gauging of Turkish politics, which is not a good idea. And why does it matter what type of people are voting for the HDP, the more votes they get the better is it not? By having them in parliament they actually have a voice. I see no reason why a supporter of Kurds and the HDP wouldn't want them last the 10% threshold."
kurdistan,37dlsr,Lebensunwertesleben,0,Wed May 27 07:49:45 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why a supporter of Kurds and the HDP wouldn't want them last the 10% threshold.    Because it can result in MHP/AKP or MHP/CHP coalition. No one wanna hear their voice, to them Kurds who support HDP are still terrorist. They wanna use Kurds.   CHP and MHP despise Kurd political movement and Kurds more than AKP does. When it comes to Kurd problem, AKP is more progressive than CHP. Don't act like you have no idea about it. Average CHP/MHP politician hate HDP with a passion.   Everyone is entitled to his opinion tho.   I think HDP should go into coalition with AKP, but it seems highly unlikely."
kurdistan,37dlsr,idontIikecats,5,Wed May 27 08:02:26 2015 UTC,"The AKP doesn't give a rats ass about the Kurds though, Erdogan uses them for political gain. Just look at all the fishy shit happening in Syria. The HDP not being in parliament means the Kurds have no voice in Turkish politics."
kurdistan,37dlsr,cbt13,3,Wed May 27 08:16:32 2015 UTC,So you are saying you don't want HDP to take 10% for Kurds own sake?   How come the whole party doesn't think like that than? You think they don't know what you know?
kurdistan,37dlsr,Lebensunwertesleben,1 point,Wed May 27 08:23:44 2015 UTC,"So you are saying you don't want HDP to take 10% for Kurds own sake?    pretty much, I don't think Kurds can accomplish anything via current political system anyways. What idontliekcats said is also true, AKP doesnt care about Kurds neither.   We'll see on 7th of june. I don't think anything will change in Turkey tho. Same ole turkey.."
kurdistan,37dlsr,cbt13,3,Wed May 27 08:32:07 2015 UTC,What about the new constitution that all parties promised to prepare? Don't you think it would be much better if HDP goes >10%?

The PKK has never showed tolerance for other parties and ideologies when in a position of power.  Just look at rojava.  This author is talking about barzani's decreasing influence in rojava.  I wonder if ypg arresting and harassing barzani supporters has something to do with that.  Even human rights watch published a report harshly criticizing ypg for their intolerance towards civilian activists who weren't with them.  And most recently they killed rojhelati peshmergas over a turf war? In an area that the kdpi has been operating in for decades? These guys aren't nationalistic or patriotic, they just want power.

Something we recently saw that they did while cooperating with PKK (Party of Kurd Killers) .  And for your record PDKI also engaged in battles with the IRGC today and actually manage to kill three of them in Ourmye unlike PKK.

Even now in rojava they don't allow any other Kurdish factions to fight, with the exception of kobane which was an extremely desperate and unique situation.  Their thinking is that if they prevent others from taking part in the revolution, then no one else will have a say in the aftermath.

What I'm really talking about is the nature of belief systems and how opinions are formed.  I am trying to avoid forming an opinion on the matter, since I can't read most news sources with information on it, and also because I recognize that my bias is towards the PKK. Perhaps your bias is the other way, if so it doesn't mean you're wrong, just that you should keep an open mind and try to understand opposing viewpoints, in this situation as in all others."

I've discussed it with people who have opinions on both sides of the spectrum. This is what has led me to come to my opinion that the PKK are strongly in the wrong here.   I've heavily criticized Rudaw in the past, and even in this thread, which shows again how there is no ""bias"" involved. Just 20 minutes ago I was having a discussion with friends, presenting PKK's viewpoint from a reasonable stance and what their explanation for the incident was. I could easily come in here and defend the PKK because I know what has happened as much as possible, but I won't because they are clearly in the wrong."

The PKK through PJAK has fought the Iranians for the last decade while the PDK-I spends most of their time in KRG hotels, has a head office in Erbil and are extremely influenced by Barzini.  What does PDK-I expect when they roll into a PKK controlled town, especially since PDKI leaders can not go a single day without talking shit about the PKK/PJAK to the media? It is asking for hostile provocation. And really Iran backs the PKK? What? The PKK are not under the control or take any direction from the Iranian regime like PUK does, or in the way the KDP-I is extremely influenced by Barzini and the KDP/KRG. The only one in the last decade fighting for maximum Kurdish rights and full autonomy in Iran is the PKK/PJAK. There has been many countless intense fights between Iran and PJAK, which is the Iranian branch of the PKK basically. Many PKK and PJAK fighters have died from clashes with Iranian forces, and have taken many Pasdaran and Basij members with them. It is disingenuous to say PKK is cooperating with Iran, that is simply Rudaw and Barzini clan propoganda and misinformation that makes no sense. In fact it is PDK-I of Iran who is cooperating with Iran and they have direct dialogue with each other. The PDK-I of Iran is a legal party in Iranian parliement. On the other hand Iran considers the PKK and PJAK as terorist organizations and they are banned and the Iranian regime refuses to have any public direct dialogue with PJAK/KODAR. Iran are the ones who have cooperated with the fascist Turkish state to share intel and attack the PKK/PJAK bases in the Qandil Mountains. How does it make any sense to say the Mullah regime directs and controls the PKK whe the Iranian military literally shells their bases every other day? How can you consider the Ayatollah led sectarian Islamist regime to be backing the PKK when they shell there bases constantly and have been fighting their affiliated branch in Iran for the last decade? It makes no logical sense and is an absurd ridiculous conclusion! The KCK, PKK, PYD and PJAK simply have absolutely no state sponser and do not take orders from other countries unlike certain other parties."

Btw why wasn't ocalan with his guerrillas in bakur? Instead he was in the comfort and safety of Assad the kurd oppressor.  And when that ended he was going from country to country begging for asylum.  Why not just go to bakur with his troops? Countless young men and women dying for the cause but he was too good to get his own hands dirty? Don't get me wrong I love and have the utmost respect for the guerrillas, but ocalan is nothing.

kurdistan,36kdy1,FeyliXan,1 point,Wed May 20 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"Repeated human rights violations are terrible, but it is a mistake to call it Genocide. It minimizes what actual genocide looks like which in turn makes countries less likely to step in when there are bonafied massive death squads massacring hundreds of thousands of people in a matter of months. Genocide happens fast, the international community has very strict guidelines for what constitutes genocide and ethnic cleansing for that reason. They are good standards and ought be respected.   Does that make the Israeli war crimes, murders, jailings and systematic disenfrachment of Palestinians excusable? No, far far from it. They are major, terrible crimes. But if you call it genocide the international community will not listen because you sound misinformed and alarmist. War crimes and ethnic discrimination do not equal whole scale slaughter of a population. It's just another breed of shitty ethnic conflict.   The best that the Palestinians and Israelis can hope for is a situation like Ireland, where the Palestinians get some but not all of their land back and both countries are pressured into engaging with each other economically and there's still ethnic violence for decades at a lower intensity. It's not going to end up like South Africa, and BDS is kidding themselves if they think it is. South Africa was a radically different situation with different dynamics. In some ways it was almost easier to solve. The Palestianins and Israelis don't want to live in the same country, they don't want to share power, and they have extremely opposing views on what Israel/Palestine should look like. They aren't looking for a unified congress, they're looking for separate nation states at best.  Also fuck BDS, because they use a bunch of leftist rhetoric but are run by shills for a shitty religious and conservative crowd with sympathies for Hamas, who are also awful. White college students with no family or relationship to the conflict do a bunch of screaming and think that they're involved with the next Nelson Mandela when it's waaaay muddier and more fucked up than South Africa."
kurdistan,36kdy1,CynicalCommunist,2,Thu May 21 16:57:51 2015 UTC,"I think this is pretty much 100% true.  But when you say human rights violations it hasn't been just Israel, I will admit my country has done bad things, like pretty much almost every other country has. But Palestinians are certainly not godly, or at least their government isn't. Harboring Hamas is a bad thing, shaking hands with Hamas is also a bad thing. Hamas is a TO, recognized by many as bad. They have targeted civilians and have done bad things, if Palestine didn't side with Hamas than I wouldn't mind them but their leadership foundation is built on killing Israelis and ousting them, it will never happen and like you said they need to find a solution like Ireland-UK. Israel is here for good, its military power is unquestioned in the region the most we can do is to just sit down and accept the fact that this happened and figure out ways to live where we don't shoot at each other. It sucks for some Palestinians but the world isn't just some fair place I mean Israel is nothing compared to what other nations and former empires have done. It's geopolitical politics, stuff happens and you just got to adapt once it reaches the point where the other side is vastly more powerful."

Blatant feelings of racial superiority. Total hatred for Kurdish national aspirations.  Can someone please explain this?

kurdistan,36hcyn,idontIikecats,4,Tue May 19 15:15:44 2015 UTC,"Well, the Kurdish southeast is underdeveloped, only recently has it seen more investment. Education and economic development for the periphery has historically been shoved to the background.   Even though the great majority of people was ignorant 100 years back, the rest of Turkey saw considerable development, and a large ideological overhaul. Nationalism and ethnocentrism is deeply entrenched in Turkey, which is very different from the multiethnic empire that the Ottoman Empire was for a large part of its history (until, you know, massacres and genocides and whatnot), where the term 'Turk' was even shunned by the higher classes.  This nationalism did of course mean a break with the past, and, like many places in the Middle East, criticism and empathy aren't very much present in Turkey. Kurds were the biggest minority, and it would have been beneficial for Turkey had the Kurds been completely assimilated. Instead, the Kurds (or at least, those who want autonomy, more rights, etc.) are seen as unwelcome elements, undermining the 'Turkey for Turks' thought, and are seen as traitors and whatnot, planning on 'destroying Turkey'.   Those bent on exposing some of the falsehoods and dark pages of the past and the present, are largely resented and casted off as being liars, frauds, shills etc. This is because education and the media are very manipulated, little accurate knowledge of minorities and their woes seem to be possessed by the general populace.   You wouldn't believe the amount of times I read of people believing that ""there has never been a Kurdistan"" (while it was an administrative/autonomous region in the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere), ""Kurds have no history"", ""Kurdish isn't really a language, it's just a mix of Turkish, Arabic and Persian"", ""Alevi Kurds are actually Turkmen"", ""Kurds didn't exist as an ethnicity until the 20th century"" and so on."
kurdistan,36hcyn,SnowGN,0,Tue May 19 15:24:25 2015 UTC,It seems like the Middle East is very unkind to its minorities in general...  But why do the Turks and the Arabs specifically hate your people?
kurdistan,36hcyn,idontIikecats,4,Tue May 19 15:26:40 2015 UTC,"Same reason, Kurds want autonomy or independence, which would mean a loss of land.  I have to add some nuance, they don't all hate Kurds, some seem to like us, but they have very little understanding for a Kurdistan. For Turkey, this would mean as loss of lands for which the ancestors shed their blood. From Arabs I've frequently heard that they view it as 'racist', despite their regimes repression of minorities."
kurdistan,36hcyn,SnowGN,2,Tue May 19 17:12:31 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, of course, there are always going to be exceptions, even massive exceptions to racial level generalizations. But the collective and concerted actions of Turkish and Arab governments have always and generally been inimical to your people.   As far as I can tell Arabs are legitimately some of the most racist people on the planet. I don't exactly care to know why. They are the enemies of the Jews, that's not going to change anytime soon.   Most racism seems to be rooted in insecurity, manifesting as hatred. The Arabs have much to be insecure about as a people. The Turks on the other hand confuse me, since they have a cultural legacy to be proud of."

kurdistan,35uv0h,iSqueezeAutists,2,Wed May 13 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"They are for the most part, but the middle eastern countries tend to have porous borders(as in shitty border patrol) and to assume the kurds in Iran haven't kept or maintained weapons incase of need would be wrong. With as much persecution on thier culture and heritage that both iran and turkey have inflicted it wouldn't suprise me if the kurds in both areas have a somewhat decent but limited arsenal."
kurdistan,35uv0h,Rostamy-Zal,2,Thu May 14 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"actually Turkey and iran have one of the few competent and decent armed forces in the area. Turkey's purpousfully keeping the border porous to fund ISIS against the Kurds. But Iran isn't doing so and after the war PJAK apparently withdrew in 2011  so I think these guys are indeed PJAK but aren't officially staying so. (it's amazing what Wikipedia can teach you!)   I think these guys are PJAK remnants, as in they were some of the few who slipped under the radar. Also groups like PJAK tend to be pretty handy with their equipment, low maintainence equipment is  used  to a great degree (like the AK, RPK, and SVD hardly requires maintainence). I don't know why the peshmerga began using M4's . AK's are better in my opinion :D   From what my Persian friend tells me the Iranian regime treats all of its people like crap, but isn't Kurdish taught in schools? From what I've seen Kurds haven't faced anywhere near the same amount of repression in Iran as they do in Turkey."
kurdistan,35uv0h,boziud,5,Thu May 14 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"Firstly this video is a few years old, I have seen it before & doesn't have any relation to what's been going on recently. Secondly, these guys are just a group of kurd's, no affiliation to any party, if they did there would be immense consequences, as for the weapons, they are still available to buy & illegally import from Iraq or other neighbouring countries. Also Kurdish isn't taught in schools, its illegal, however recently the Iranian regime has started to change its mind & will possibly begin to teach kurdish. Although everyone is  oppressed in Iran, Kurds & other ethnic minorities are treated alot worse than Persians, although the Islamic regime tries to repress nationalist identities, Iran is fairly Persian--centric. Kurds in Iran got it just as bad as everywhere else, we dont particularly like competing for 'who is oppressed the most'"
kurdistan,35uv0h,literarycanteven,1 point,Thu May 14 12:23:06 2015 UTC,"As far as I know iran has made it illegal to educate with thd kurdish language, continously imprisoned kurdish activists (and executed), the destruction/prohibition of thier mosques (sunni), the blatant under industrialization/funding of the kurdish majority regions.  While turkey takes the cake for being the biggest jackass, Iran is a close second."

It is very difficult to take this seriously, particularly if you have any knowledge of Iran or Iranian Kurds. Kermanshah does have significant Kurdish population, but it also has ethnic Persians and a significant amount of ethnic Azeris. Kermanshahi Kurds are almost all Shia, not Sunni, and fairly well integrated into Iran.   Most of the separatist Kurdish activity in Iran is in the West Azerbaijan Province, not Kermanshah. There might be people taking arms in Mahabad, but not here. This kind of video is made to impress foreigners who don't have a clue about regional dynamics, otherwise its very insignificant and nothing new. Like I said, look at non-Shia, more rural Kurdish areas if you want to see separatism, not urban Shia centers."

Basically two of the weakest ways you can counter someone are namecalling and and ad-hominem . . . they basically show you have no point to make and cannot refute the person's argument.  Instead, an effective method is countering the actual points raised. I raised 3 primary points:   There is a significant population of ethnic Azeris and ethnic Persians in Kermanshah.  The majority of Kermanshahi Kurds are Shia There is not a significant level of Kurdish separatist activity in Kermanshah, as opposed to other places like Mahabad.    Which claim do you disagree with?

Apart from that, you regime supporters keep using the word ""seperatist"" as if you have any understanding of the scope of anti-regime sentiment in Kermashah. You absolutely don't.   Basically two of the weakest ways you can counter someone are namecalling and and ad-hominem . . . they basically show you have no point to make and cannot refute the person's argument.   This is not debate class, you have no points or arguments. You keep spouting propaganda. Why would I ever take you serious?

To clarify I did not say that Kermanshah is not majority Kurdish, but rather that it is not exclusively Kurdish. There's a difference.  Also the while many Kermanshahis may have antiregime sentiments, they are not necessarily aiming towards leaving the state and joining a Kurdish state. Hence the word seperatist. If there's a better word for such a group Id be glad to use it.  So to go back to the point, do you dispute any of the three claims I made?"

I've heard it said before, from you as well, but I've never really seen the source of this claim.   How about just the nepotism?   Welcome to fucking reality. It is like that in every country.. You think Bush junior got to where he was because he was good at what he does? You don't think his father got him to places? You think every country which has a royal family (pretty much nearly every country without a revolution), because God came down and chose a family to be treated specially? Or it's basically nepotism! Be realistic. For example, the labour leaders in the UK were two brothers fighting over the labour leadership.. The reality is even on the smaller level it is said 80% of jobs are landed through networking, whether friends, family or just connections! We do it on every fucking level, we put in people we think we trust.  KRG is barely 10 years old, there are enemies in every single direction and the fictional attitude you have is just naive. These countries are now sending in puppets, with funds to gather support, and with the internet they don't need to send any journalists inside, all can be done via the internet to convince people like you to just start complaining about the most idiotic things.. When Kurdistan has settled and we aren't risking destroying everything by attacking ourselves, we can risk cleaning up, that day will come. Right now, we can only push for the best options peacefully. Naturally Kurds will be seeking to to take positions higher up, natural selection will take place as well as time goes by.  If countries start to think this guy steals billions, like you, they will stop meeting him, agreeing to support Kurdistan in independence, well fucking done genius. And what are you doing for Kurdistan, apart from talking shit?  EDIT: So looking at your posts, you seem to not be Kurdish, so your comments are not really views coming from Kurds, just you think coming here making these comments means people will believe it blindly."

Ibn Taymiyyah FATHER-OF-SALAFI CHECK, probably has a Kurdish in him, born in Harran (Turkish Kurdistan), lived during 14th century when Muslim world was facing Mongols (obvious Jihad)), modern Saudi were like let me use that anger of ibn Taymiyyah and bring it back again.

To throw away democracy because the government is slow and the bureaucracy is inefficient does NOT mean it is the fault of democracy. These problems are even worse in dictatorships.   It is slow and inefficient because it requires disagreeing factions to consult and agree with one another.

Northern Iraq is ten fold better than the rest of Iraq which was under Malaki's authoritarian rule.   Everything that happens in Kurdistan is under time pressure from a potential invasion.   As was Israel for decades, and yet they have a functioning democracy, and have the strongest economy and military in the region.    What Kurdistan needs is a Federal government. Give strong regional representation which can decide their own regional needs, with a singular Federal government deciding country wide issues and protects the entirety of the state. Use Germany as an example."
kurdistan,35iwyr,hensomm,-1,Mon May 11 09:05:41 2015 UTC,"South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore are also near completely unified as a people with very strong unity.   Singapore is a multi-ethnic society and was at its inception further away from unity than Kurdistan ever could be. Yet, an authoritarian government succeeded in unifying the heterogenous population. Why should we not emulate that instead of having a system that accomodates and perpetuates our disunity? Besides, our disunity isn't caused by cultural or religious differences, or even tribes, but stupid political parties that grow on our society like a cancer. Disarming and outlawing all political parties (except the ruling one) and sending their members to labour camps can solve that overnight. If that doesn't suit our Western 'allies', no problem - China will be keen to buy our oil, and unlike the West they set no political and cultural demands on their allies.   They are three exceptions to the rule   They are not - there is China, the entire former USSR and Eastern Europe. These countries did most certainly not end in destruction and have a dignified existence today, one that would satisfy Kurds. There is no ""rule"" of authoritarian governments leading to eventual destruction statistically or causally, of which the latter you have not even explained. Your generalization of authoritarian regimes is a caricature of third-world hellholes ruled by deranged men like Saddam Hussein, Idi Amin and Pol Pot. Our leaders are not like that, they might be imbeciles or cowards but they are never crazy.    But even if you were right, why should we forsake the certain advantages of a dictatorship because of the contingency of eventual ruin? The way democratic Kurdistan is going, it will be functionally equal to a destroyed nation: our economy is developing to be ""integrated"" in global markets, meaning it will not produce to sustain our country but instead specialize in some products to be exported and with the revenue generated import our daily necessities. This is totally contrary to our interests. And all because the government is too weak and inert to direct the economy and pass laws & policies that would enable them to. With an authoritarian government we have better chances, and we need one to abort this disastrous trend before it is too late.    And it is a high quality and reliable service, that paid its workers well, and has a lower upkeep. Where as China has hundreds of these build a year but fall apart within the same year. Fast =/= Good   Straw man. My criticism wasn't aimed at the time it took to construct the railway but the previous 10+ years spent gaining the political, legal and financial support for this project, which are indeed unneeded under a system such as China's.   And yes, there is a certain pressure to do things fast in Kurdistan because as I have said our neighbours are looking to invade us, in particular the vermin that exists to our north. The only reason that country hasn't tried to invade yet is because they see that Kurdistan is ruled by spineless fools who can be coerced to piss on Kurdish sovereignty at their whim - manifestations of which being Turkish military bases (!) in Kurdistan, Gulen schools in Kurdistan, Turkish soaps appearing on Kurdish television, markets for Turkish goods in Kurdistan, KDP attacking PKK, etcetera.    The Turks, Arabs, and Iranians which the Kurds left because the Kurds were repressed by their authoritarian rulers... You are leaving one evil for another evil but this one speaks Kurdish.   This is the most insidious pro-democracy argument there is, and it's rubbish. The Turks, Iranians and previously Arabs repress us because we are a different ethnicity with a different language & culture that undermines the coveted unity and uniformity of their countries. Our repression at the hands of their governments is a consequence of conflicting interests between Kurds and the ethnic groups they represent. Turkey, Iran and previously Iraq and Syria all have/had varying degrees of authoritarianism but their repression of Kurds is all the same.   But what is more important to dispel here is the underlying logic (or illogic) of your argument. It assumes that because we suffered under something attributed to our enemies, it would harm us again if it became attributed to us. I have seen this reasoning come in many variations: ""Oh Kurds don't be racist, racism hasn't helped Kurds in Turkey"", ""don't be secular, Kemalists and Baathists are secular"", ""don't have the death penalty, Iranians are hanging your people in public"", and so on, as though we should shun everything associated with our enemies. I don't think like that. When Kurds are dying under Iraqi planes dropping chemical bombs I am not weeping and sulking in a corner or consoling myself with the thought that Kurds are more ""humane"", I am thinking how Kurds got to being so weak and Iraqis to being so strong, and how we might learn from the enemy to enhance our chances of survival in the future. Anyone who categorically shuns what the enemy represents is afflicted with slave morality.    Democracy has had 0 years in Kurdistan, since Kurdistan is yet to be a country. It has had since 2005 in Northern Iraq...   This is a case of no-true-scotsman, nothing more. The KRG governs South Kurdistan, its formal status as a non-state makes no difference. It was established in 1991 and held its first elections one year later, so 23 years."
kurdistan,35iwyr,thecake_is_a_lie1,1 point,Wed May 13 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"I had a massive response and hit back... so here is a short response.    Ethnicity - There have been no studies or findings that the more ethnically diverse a country is the worse off it is or vice versa in any combination. There are dozens of examples for all situations of a country's ethnic makeup and how well off it is.  The factor it always boils down to is a strong civil society and political involvement.    All former Communist states went through eras of decades long mass poverty, starvation, and famine. The Soviets, Chinese, Vietnamese, Cubans, Warsaw Pact, ext. had millions die due to failed attempts at central planning, because of the law of diminishing returns shows that centralized manpower manipulation as was the key of authoritarian rulers for hundreds of years has always failed.  Other non-communist rulers such as Mobutu, Saddam, Idi Amin (and then Museveni), The Kims, Mugabe, Assad, Qaddafi, Than Shwe, Chavez, Putin, Ali Kha, and dozens more ALL failed to create any semblance of what could even imagine to be a functioning economy or political structure. Those of which that which are no longer in office left either another authoritarian in their place, or their country collapsed into Civil War.     certain advantages of a dictatorship   Which would be, and provide sources that back up that dictatorships actually provide these advantages.     The Turks, Iranians and previously Arabs repress us because we are a different ethnicity with a different language & culture that undermines the coveted unity and uniformity of their countries.   And guess what the past literal hundred years of dictators have used as an excuse for political mishaps... minorities and those different from them.   Hitler, the Jews - Mao, The Religious - Stalin, Muslims - Saddam, Shias and Kurds - Rwanda and Burundi, the Hutu and Tutsi - All of Somalia is based around a single ethnicity fighting because they blame each other - Yugoslavia started by Serbians blaming Croats - Leopoldo Galtieri, The British - and hundreds more.  So if and when the dictators of Kurdistan are in a pinch do you expect them not to do what is the near 100% common trend of dictators? Who would you prefer the Kurdish dictator wipe out? A specific tribe, the Yazidi, Assyrians, or someone else?  Tell me, how is it possible that when Saddam did what did in in Halabja as a dictator, in a political crisis, using a minority as a scapegoat that you would EVER put Kurdistan in that same circumstance again?     ""Oh Kurds don't be racist, racism hasn't helped Kurds in Turkey"", ""don't be secular, Kemalists and Baathists are secular"", ""don't have the death penalty, Iranians are hanging your people in public""   These are things that don't happen 100%. To say YOU can have a dictator and that YOU won't make the same mistake as nearly 2 billion people have made in the past 100 years... is foolish... it is beyond foolish... it is pure stupidity.      This is a case of no-true-scotsman, nothing more. The KRG governs South Kurdistan, its formal status as a non-state makes no difference. It was established in 1991 and held its first elections one year later, so 23 years.   So Kurdistan was a free and democratic country during the Reign of Saddam? Quick someone tell the Kurds."

Wherever this has been done before, it was under a 'dictatorship': the USSR in the 1930s, South Korea, Singapore & Taiwan in the Cold War, Communist China - examples abound. Feats of rapid industrialisation have never been accomplished under a democracy, because it is incapable of delivering that.    KRG does not need to get rid of democracy   Try to refute my arguments then, I wrote a full text here arguing that it should.

The biggest problem is nepotism, once they start to promote people based on their accomplishments and not their family names the KRG will start to improve.    Well, why do you suppose the KRG has been unable to crack down on corruption and nepotism? Could it be because power in a democratic system is shared with the practitioners and beneficiaries of said corruption?

China while a much better example still has abyssmal ratings for corruption, as well as terrible oversight for the working class. With any government thier will be issues. And PS the US as well as France and other countries have experienced rapid industrialization at one time or another. I think what needs to be done first is garnering enough support from the international community to have kurdistan removed from semiautonomy to being a fully recognized country so that trade can be established unabatted by the current iraq issues, as well as having allies to buy/trade militarily without having restraints on lethal aid etc. While I'm not kurdish (I'm american) the last 6 months I've been studying the kurdish political history and history in general.

kurdistan,35e6c6,Rostamy-Zal,3,Sun May 10 08:23:40 2015 UTC,"It seems that some writers are content in claiming descendance from any ancient people if they inhabited the regions Kurds inhabit now, or if their ethnonym sounds alike.   This is faulty, of course. You must know that the ancient Assyrians were probably the first who employed deportations and assimilations on a large scale. When the Iranic tribes had entered the Iranian Plateau, and thereafter Mesopotamia, the Hurrians had already long been conquered and assimilated.   Pockets of them may have survived, and it's theorized that Urarteans were successors to these Hurrians. I'm not terribly knowledgeable on this period, but apparently, the Urarteans were defeated by the Medes, aided by an Armenian family who were then to become the elite of that population, thereby forcing their language on them. Of course, the Kurds likely do have some Hurrian DNA (West Asian populations are all a mixed bag), but to consider them 'proto-Kurds' is pushing it.  Izady's maps are pretty cool, but his writings display an obvious bias."

He jumps to assumptions in some of his articles, then uses those articles as reference points and even evidence for the claims he makes himself when he talks about it later in another one of his agenda driven articles..  Nobody should trust this guy as he has links to the Iraqi central government and he's basically a lobbyist for them in Washington. Notice he never talks anything bad about Baghdad and downplays corruption in Iraq in positive ways like:   While the Iraq government has replaced generals (and its prime minister) and sought to regroup after the Iraqi Army’s disastrous showing against the backdrop of ISIS’ seizure of Mosul and its rapid advance across the heart of Iraq, there has been no similar soul-searching in the KRG.   Yeah, yeah, I'm sure Iraq has changed.. He claims about Sinjar falling, when ultimately if you want to put blame somewhere, why not blame the central government for completely failing to defend their own stockpiles of weapons? He has never once said this.. Just constantly blaming the Kurds for something that isn't the same as Kobani.. Sinjar fell, the whole place got overrun with ISIS that was carrying FRESH, unused weapons and military equipment with moral so high, as they were practically going around in Iraq unchallenged that they got so cocky they were even willing to push into Kurdish areas.. The Kurds are expected to fight off armor that was never given to them BECAUSE of this whole point that he's so trying to argue against - arming the Kurds properly, directly.   If the goal is to defeat ISIS, the Kurds should receive weaponry and support, but it should be the right Kurds. If Barzani is going to put family and tribal considerations ahead of Kurdistan’s security or the fight against ISIS, then the United States should supervision distribution of that weaponry to ensure that Baghdad and Erbil send it where it is most needed.   The whole point of Kurdistan requesting the right to receive weapons directly is to prevent Baghdad delaying it as much as possible and even not providing the Kurdish share. Claiming Kirkuk never received those weapons is pretty much like claiming he knows more about the distribution and defence of Kurdistan than Kurds themselves..  He's a hypocrite with an agenda and he's basically just constantly writing stuff about which Kurds to side with.. If fighting ISIS is his supposed to be the number one goal here, he should never so against this.. Simply put, he has an agenda and that's making sure Kurds are weak enough to be controlled by Iraq."

Not only is that just wrong, but isn't that a bit too convenient for him as either you disagree with what he says or you find yourself supporting what he says about the KRG and believing the shit that he's suggesting like Barzani wants Kirkuk to fall..  He quite clearly does not want an independent Kurdistan and he's going as far as not wanting the KRG to be armed directly because of it, using silly arguments like Baghdad needs to control the arms so other Kurds get arms too!!

Their style of government is mostly authoritarian, the cult they have produced for their leader ""no life without Ocalan"" etc is a bit weird however also effective in propaganda/ support , their constantly changing ideology (are they Marxist Leninsts? Socialists? Nationalists? Democratic Socialist?) and the fact that they still hail Ocalan from prison who has literally become a Turkish puppet (his recent papers on Kurdistan not even being a country but a federal, autonomous system???) are probably their only downside for me. Everything else about them is great, and it's a lot of things they have as well, and they're probably the only Kurdish party I can feel pride for.

""Back in the day can"" span a large period of time. Sources on the origins of these religions are also lacking, so for the early periods speculation and comparative method are our primary tools. From what I recall, Yazdanism was influenced by Zoroastrianism and other Mesopotamian religions. Zoroastrianism was also practiced by very renowned and powerful figures, most notably the Achaemenid and Sassanian kings. During those periods, I think Zoroastrianism would be the more popular of the two. During the rule of the Medes, I believe people practiced some form of early or proto-Zoroastrianism and/or Mithraism. That being said, Yazdanism, where it was centrally rooted, was likely the more common religion. A quick search shows that the Zagros mountains were one of these former locations.   I'd say that Zoroastrianism was always the bigger and more widely practiced religion of the two.

Both Zoroastrianism & the Yazdani faiths ( i.e Ezidi's, Yarsani's, Alevi's) have roots in the same ancient faith, which was our (kurds) original faith, Mithraisim. Zardasht reformed mithraism, tye yazdani faiths each took a different path, but because zoroastrianism sprouted in Eastern Iran earlier than it did in Western Iran, it has alot of components that where adapted with non-kurdish cultures, whereas the Yazdani faiths, although having been influenced heavily by abrahamic faiths, remains mainly oreinted around Kurdish culture. As for the article, the writer focuses on a different hypothesis of Zardasht's origins than we (Kurdish zoroastrians) do, but nonetheless alot of points made are not really disputable. Yazdani faiths was much more widley spread amongst kurds than Zoroastrianism was, you can think of the two as the different sides of the iranic faiths, with yazdanism always being linked with Kurds, however the Yazdani's of today have radically changed their beliefs & although the faith is linked with kurdish culture, it loosly represents what it once was. The teachings of Zardasht have had a large impact on Yazdani faiths, but one main difference is that whilst zoroastrianism is dualist, yazdani faiths are monotheist."

kurdistan,357kn6,che899,2,Fri May 8 11:18:07 2015 UTC,"I have a problem with solely focusing on the linguistic link to prove whether Kurds are descendants of Medians or not. Does language determine ethnicity? If so, then many people in the Middle East and North Africa are suddenly descendants of Arabs, even though we know many of them are (descendants of) Berbers, Egyptians, and others. People lose languages, especially after thousands of years. We can say from a logical point of view that many Kurds probably are the descendants of Medians considering the lands correspond to a great degree. It will likely always be impossible to prove this relation.   Since the earlies Kurdish literary work extant is the Diwan of Malaê Jizrî, who probably died c. 1480, these few words, for what they are worth, may constitute the earliest record of Kurdish.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurmizgan  ?  P.S. I like these logs :)"
kurdistan,357kn6,che899,2,Fri May 8 10:11:00 2015 UTC,"The Hurmizgan poem is, in all likeliness, a fake.  Focusing solely on a linguistic link is indeed faulty. We must then ask ourselves what does connect us specifically to the Medians? They indeed settled near Kermanshah, and probably near Sulaymaniyah (judging by Qyzqapan), but so they did near the Caspian Sea, in Hamadan, in Central Iran etc.  I'm not saying we don't have Median ancestry though. Our direct ancestors probably derived in some way or another of a Median tribe. I'm guessing the Southern Kurds descend from certain Parthian tribes, who themselves had mixed with Medians."

The published “early Kurdish” text of this fictional document is completely spurious.""  Prolegomena to the Study of Kurds  ""One of the most interesting products of Kurdish identity-makers in constructing an ancient historical and cultural background for the Kurds is the famous “Suleimaniye Parchment of the 7th Century in Old Kurdish”... Mackenzie (1963b) had shown that this is a typical fake evoked by the discovery of the Avroman documents (see Nyberg 1923; Edmonds 1925; idem 1952; Henning 1958: 28-30), still the “Suleimaniye Parchment” remains a living artefact of “Kurdish antiquity”, a permanent point of return for all Kurdish authors trying to widen the recorded time-span of Kurdish history and culture (see, e.g., Xamoyan 1972).""  As I said before, Asatrian talks a lot of shit, but this seems very plausible. An eight century gap between the first and subsequent attestation of a written language itself is hard to believe. But let's say it's possible that a lone wolf decided to write down a short text in his own vernacular for just once, even then it's hard to consider it authentic, because, apparently, the text does not significantly deviate from modern Hewrami. I only wish I could access Mackenzie's article 'Pseudoprotokurdica' wherein it's discussed."

Now 30+ years later Kurds have more rights in Turkey than ever before thanks to Ocalan and as a consequence of the PKK launching an uprising against Turkey, Kurds in Syria are emancipated after years of repression and live in de-facto autonomy/independence in the Rojava cantons that are controlled by the PYD/YPG who are members of the KCK, an organization controlled and run by the PKK with it's headquarters in the Qandil Mountains.  It is never a good time to start an uprising many will say, but fortune favors the bold and if the Kurds in Iran want to be free from the Mullah regime then they will have to fight for their rights like the Kurds in Iraq, Syria and Turkey have done. PJAK can't so it all NY themselves since they where the only ones actually fighting the Ayatollah controlled regime while other Kurds got co-opted and have become Jash in Iran."

Tensions are on edge in the ethnically Kurdish city of Mahabad, Iran, where protesters earlier torched a hotel over the unexplained death one of its female employees.  Police on Thursday used tear gas to remove hundreds of demonstrators from the area in front of the damaged Tara Hotel, leading to near riot conditions in the city some 200km from the border with Iraq's Kurdistan region.   At least one protester has been reported injured in the incident that began after the death of Farinaz Khosrawani, 25, who was killed by a fall from the 4th floor of the hotel.  The death was denounced by local demonstrators who suspected foul play. Despite the arrest of a suspect, protesters set fire to part of the hotel.   These protestors are fucking stupid, police already have a suspect in custody, but again it's only a suspect and she could have died from falling off on her own. the owner of the Hotel is Kurdish and so are its employees, what are they trying to achieve here!?"
