ems,3e0u7r,SDAdam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:12 2015 UTC,The only time it would be an issue is if you were just being lazy. There are plenty of cases where I could not get a manual BP. Even in ideal quiet conditions. Some people are just like that. That's not counting people that are 70 systolic and you just can't get it.   Generally though for the ambulance ride after I have a manual BP if I don't use the auto cuff doing a palpated spot check is fine as well.

ems,3e0u7r,SDAdam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:03:48 2015 UTC,"I Don't ever palpate a blood pressure clinically. Palpated blood pressures have an accuracy of +/- 30mmHg. This means that if you say ""90/p"" it could be 60 or it could be 120. Absolutely meaningless.  Palpated blood pressures are not clinical tools. I hate to say it, but it's one of the quickest ways that I know I need to take other responders information wit ha grain of salt. It's one thing for a completely healthy BLS PT, but on any other call it's much more clinically significant to say you can't get a Bp. There is nothing wrong with that at all. Sometimes peoplse anatomy make it tough in the field.  Document UTO and why if there is a reason and then document other indications of perfusion status.

ems,3dzag0,RiverRunnerVDB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"The less trucks you run the less likely you are to get fucked, but then some services still do it.  For example, one service I used to work at used a next up system at their main station.  They ran 5 trucks out of four stations.  (2 in the main station, 1 at each substation).  The 2 trucks ran on a next up system for YEARS while I worked there, the year after I left dispatch came out with a dispatching system where in at clock in one truck was xx1 and the other was xx2.  xx1 would run first out on EVERY call and xx2 would run second out.  If xx2 volunteered to go out dispatch would say no, keep the run on xx1 and if xx2 persisted then the dispatch supervisor was given the authority to write them up.  It was fucked.  It was changed after a few months but still you could get a lazy tech on xx2 who wouldn't volunteer and xx1 would be run fucked for an entire 24 and sometimes xx2 wouldn't make a run all shift.  This is from the brilliant minds in dispatch, in a system that ran 8-9k runs a year on a 5 truck 2 response car system.  (Really they needed a 6th 24/7 and a dedicated transfer truck 12 to midnight with new hire EMT's staffing it, but you know, budget.    On the flip side of that, another county I worked for ran the EXACT same system but less run volume (about 6k-ish runs a year) and we ran like a fucking team.  If we were closer, we came up for the run, if we knew another truck was getting run fucked with transfers we'd volunteer to take the transfer and have them come to our station to cover our sector while we made that run (if we were in the adjacent sector, we couldn't do it if we were cross county from them), etc.  Just depends on your co-workers too."

ems,3dzag0,fireinthesky7,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"Power.  The logic was that ONE of the captains was an EMT and needed to be available, even though the shifts LT was a paramedic and was in a car and available.  So they decided to put the shifts CAptain and LT on the second truck at all times (so if the Captain was a medic in a car, they'd be in the car, but if the captain or LT was an EMT on a truck they'd be on the second out truck).  That way they'd be available at all times, but the system is dumb, it run fucks the other crew, makes the other crew resentful.  On top of that the whole truck numbering system was screwed the fuck up.  Before the rework trucks were numbered as such, 1-9 was the truck and the second number was the shift.  So frist shift would be squad 11 and second shift would be squad 12.    They changed it so each sector had a number 1-4 and the truck was assigned a number based on shift, and then the ifnal number was the number of trucks assigned to the base.  So lets assumed you were stationed at the south substation on first shift as a Basic truck.  You'd be squad 411.  4 for the station, 1 for the shift, 1 for the number of trucks stationed there (remember this system only have 5 trucks period. and only 1 at each station except the main station which has 2).     Now your partner is working a 12 hour shift and you're on a 24, so you go back for shift change in 411, your partner leaves and you're reassigned to the north station for second shift with an ALS partner.  Now for the second half of your shift you're 221-Alpha.  2 for the station, 2 for the shift, 1 for the truck number, and alpha because you're ALS.      Lets say your 24 ends and someone calls in, so you volunteer to work another 12 and 36 out, your ALS partner goes home and you get reassigned to the main station with an intermediate LT.  Now your truck is 112-Ida and you might also get called out as Med 042 because that's your LT's call sign.  So in a span of 36 hours you've not left your truck, your truck still has the painted #5 on the side for squad 5 for inventory purposes, but your call signs have been    411 221-Alpha 112-Ida and sometimes Med-042"
ems,3dzag0,Praetor80,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:29 2015 UTC,My brain simply can not comprehend such stupidity. I have a book of logic problems sitting next to me that is easier to undetstand than this nonsense.
ems,3dzag0,norunningwater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:51 2015 UTC,"Right.  Their reasoning was that the new CAD required trucks be numbered with a three digit number and this was the best they could come up with and to solve the issue with a captain being an EMT.  I get the captain part, find a solution to JUST that, but the numbering thing literally everyone in the entire EMS company was saying ""Why don't we just number our trucks with the first one or two digits the same and then just leave the last number the number of the truck.  IE we had 9 trucks, why not do like:  101-109.  And if they still wanted to do the first shift and second shift stuff we could do 101-109 and 201-209.  OMG. So hard.  Nope, dispatch director said that was too simple and didn't leave room for expansion..........................................  I get it, you need expansion room, but you run FIVE trucks.  THIS ISN'T CHICAGO OR NYC.  We aren't tracking 25-40 trucks in a major metro city of 1 million people, we're talking a small county of maybe 50k people.  It was stupid, it was one of the reasons I left.  The place was the worst managed EMS agency I've ever worked for.  Couldn't tell you the times I ran out of supplies because they refused to let a street crew, captain, or anyone who actually interacted with crews do supply orders.    When we needed supplies this is how it went.  The crew stationed at main HQ would do a nightly quick inventory, if we were getting low it would be mentioned on the shift log.  Go write it on the shift log ""Low on 20g IV needles.""  Then on Fridays the crews would do a full inventory and see what we had and what we needed and submit the order requests to the captain.  The Captain would then go in, look it over, then look at our out of service trucks and see what we had on those trucks and see if we could fill the low stock with that.  Then we would finalize the weekly inventory, put it together on this really awesome excel sheet I put together, print it out (it automatically highlighted low inventory in yellow and out of stock in orange and urgent overnight orders in red).  Then it would go to our supply manager in the front office.  She would look at it, and send it back to the captain and say that we needed to pull x, y, or z off the trucks that weren't going out.  We'd argue that those trucks had to be ready incase a truck wrecked, broke down, etc.  But we'd have to do it anyways.  Then resubmit the orders with product numbers we needed EXACTLY and how many.  Supply would get it, then send it back and say they were too expensive.  Resubmit it with less items.  Get it back with a note asking if we really needed so many bags of EKG electrodes. Meanwhile we're running without electrodes and having to ask the local services for bags of electrodes (this is when I got permission from my part time job to grab 3 bags of electrodes and a bunch of other items for my personal kit so when we ran out, I still had supplies).  We're on rations, only do x, y, or z if a patient NEEDS it.  Finally after arguing with supply for a week, supply orders it.  Gets here, they ordered the wrong item, or the wrong quantity, or the wrong type.  For example, at one point we ran out of atropine and we went back and forth with them ovrthe cost of the atropine order, finally after ordering I went to give a patient atropine and when I opened the box I was greeted with a 4"" needle and a luer lock system (as we had made teh decision, against the protest of supply manager to go needle-less).  So that was fun.  Was a terrible service with some GREAT and AMAZING EMT's and Medics I had the privileged to work with."

My partner at the time felt this was a great affront to our afternoon trips to China town for dinner or trips to Harlem for soul food or out to Brooklyn to a great fried chicken joint. So he removed the unit and walked it down the block and placed it on the local bus at the Pathmark. He gave the driver a 20 to give the box a good tour of the city then toss it off when he gets to City Island park in the Bronx.   We all thought this was really funny except the one dispatcher who was watching our signal and calling us on the radio. We told her the truth about where we were and it had nothing at all to do with what information she was seeing. We drove her insane for about 3 hours telling her we were at Columbia Presbyterian on the radio while the GPS unit was passing Shea stadium. I think she took up drinking because of us. We were at Bronx Lebanon and the GPS was going to the Battery for the 2nd ave run. I feel bad but it was really funny. Im sorry.

I wore a tie and baseball hat and a Sears button down shirt. We had polyester windbreakers in spring and Carhartt type jackets in winter. NO sunglasses and no items on your belt.   I came back from Vietnam in 1970 and kicked around a few small police agency's for a few years. I was driving a meat truck for my dad out of the first Hunts point market and took an ad out of the NY post around 1974. I got my EMT and then floated around looking for a permanent job. I think my first full time tour was 1978. We knew the lessons of combat medicine years before it was fully accepted stateside. Begging to start IVs on the radio for adults was common at first it all took time. I wasn't even allowed to say what I saw on a scope till 1980. We had to prove this stuff could be done on scene and we had to make believers out of the old guard MD's who didn't even trust nurses.

He could have just told me ""get me this....grab me that""....but every time he was on our rig......he turned into my field instructor.  I really learned a lot from him.  It made me a better EMT.  It taught me how to treat patients better.....AND....how to prepare a useful report for ALS.  Even though I'm a fire-based EMT and I don't ride the ambulance much anymore because of seniority...I still try to pass that onto the guys under me.  I tell them ""Treat ALS with respect...and learn everything you can from them....especially when they want to teach you.""  Without getting all sappy......thanks for blazing the trail, man.  We owe you.  Edit:  That was really worth a downvote?"

You do yours and I will do mine and we can work together and all have a good tour. I keep getting asked to join a volunteer agency near my home and I just know I could never deal with the crap and politics. I did my time and went on my jobs my time is over.

Additionally, my dept theoretically will reimburse me for education costs of this nature if they are relevant and can enhance my career, altho they have a rep for being a little tight fisted when giving that out. Finally, if and when I decide to rise even further than captain, it is my hope that my dept will have changed to one which puts a lot more emphasis on ems leadership than they currently do, and I will be amongst an elite minority who has more to offer than time on the job, Ill have education to back it up.

I told the charge RN my struggles during an ER clinical and asked her if I could shadow a Resp therapist instead of yet another shift in the ER. It was the best decision I made in school.   I just followed him around while he did rounds. It was ALL resp. Giving kids racemic epi in the ER. Bagging vent pt's while we moved them around. Seeing all the different  CPAP and BIPAP.    I told them that I was struggling with lung sounds and they just made special stops to see pt's in the hospital that had those conditions. I got to hear them all.   You will have to have a good rapport with the ER so they will vouch for you. I just thought of the ER as my portal to the rest of the hospital.   I did the same thing during L&D. They had a C-section and I went up and watched. The Neo natal NP was my in and she walked me through the new born exam.   Seeing all that stuff in real life when the pucker factor wasn't at 11 really made a difference."

Do you guys have any way to memorize crackles, rales, rhonchi, wheezing   watch youtube videos of what they sound like.   APE   sudden onset severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Perhaps a relevant history of recent surgery, air travel, or immobility.   COPD   it's in the name, chronic, they'll have a known history. Research emphesema vs chronic bronchitis, two different presentations.   Asthma   wheeze, usually a history and their own meds, air is trapping, they'll become barrel chested if severe, expiratory assistance sometimes used. Research the difference between mild/moderate/severe   Epiglotittis vs Croup in Peds   I'm rusty on this, very similar conditions, croup has a characteristic 'seal like barking cough'. Epiglottitis is more acute and severe, croup is a bit more gradual. Hotter fever in epiglottitis. The epiglottis is very red and swollen in epiglottitis, but never attempt to inspect the throat. Croup can be treated with nebulised adrenaline, epiglottitis is a life-threatening emergency."

ems,3e2a4g,Screamin_STEMI,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. The airway closes fast. And trying to tube them irritates the epiglottis which makes it swell more.   In my system, if the airway is still open we treat it with nebulized saline before jumping to advanced airway placement."

ems,3e2a4g,adenocard,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Top comment was well explained. I'll just also add that EVERY question I got about APE it stated how the patient was immobilized for long periods of time.  Long flights, truck drivers, long surgeries, etc."
ems,3e2a4g,m2inla,3,Tue Jul 21 13:18:01 2015 UTC,"With lung sounds, don't get your hopes up too high that you'll be able to tell the difference between rhonchi and rales.  It's an impossible standard.  Even as a physician, 90% of the time we will just call those sounds ""crackles"" because it's so difficult to hang your hat on one or the other based on just the sounds.  A lot of the time they'll actually have both.  As far a differentiating the diseases for a test scenario, you just need to study.  On written tests there will be certain buzz words that they always use, or classic findings that you're supposed to recognize.  Differentiating these conditions is way easier on the test than it is in real life, but at least real life patients aren't multiple-choice, and you'll have experiences to rely on that will help guide your practice moving forward."
ems,3e2a4g,m2inla,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:48 2015 UTC,"There should be some helpful videos on You Tube to train your ear to the different adventitious lung sounds. This well help you before you hit the field. You will master these in the field with time and effort. Outside of that, there is no trick.    You identified a weakness in your studies, which means you need to review the respiratory unit. It is best for you, in the long run, if you understand the underlying pathophysiology in the upper and lower airway that causes wheezing, rales, rhonchi, and stridor."

Everyone here will probably show you different methods, but go with what you find easy. I usually wrap it in a position of function, above the ankle, wrapping downwards, then cross it over the foot a couple times. That's what works for me. Some people just grab a pillow, bundle the ankle up, and use a ton of tape to keep it in place. Just remember PMS, and do what works for you."

ems,3dybsm,Patriots517,8,Mon Jul 20 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I can shed some light on this as someone with a hospital perspective:  Firstly, and most importantly: EMR. I have access to the complete medical record of every one of my patients, immediately. And it includes everything from what their Potassium was 10 years ago, to what their EKG looked like 30 seconds ago. And it's very easy as a hospital worker to forget that IFT doesn't necessarily have that luxury. Within the hospital we give each other reports, sure, but there is also a lot of just looking over chart/history. You get very used to it. And you also get very dependent on it.  Secondly, if a hospital is transferring a lot of stuff out, means they're a small hospital or have no specialized care, which generally means less experienced staff, or lazier staff. Same is even more true for nursing homes or assisted living facilities.   If my hospital is transferring someone out, it's either because they are extremely sick, or need specialized surgery, which usually means they are also extremely sick. And if you tried to take one of my patients without getting a report, I'd be pissed.  Also, dispatch isn't doing you favors, especially if you work for a 911 service that also does IFT. Because 911 dispatch gives highly inaccurate ETA's for units. Which is generally why you can never find the staff for your patients. I can be responsible for 4-6 extremely sick people. Which means I'm just bouncing from room to room.  Regarding not wanting your report: For my hospital, if we are transferring someone out, a report is given staff to staff over the phone to the receiving facility. And we generally expect the same. On the occasions where it is an ER to ER transfer into my hospital, I get a report from the sending facility, so unfortunately, apart from anything that happened enroute, you reiterating the report is kind of redundant. Also, that goes back to electronic medical records. Ideally i'll have checked their records before you even arrive."
ems,3dybsm,WC_Dirk_Gently,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"As someone who worked as an EMT doing my fair share of IFT to working as a floor nurse in a busy hospital I echo a lot of the points you just made. The thing a lot of EMS, including myself at one point in time, lack is perspective.  As EMS you get a call for a IFT, you get some basic info such as a name, general condition, and receiving hospital. You show up as soon as you can generally or its scheduled and you have a little bit of time to make your way over. You arrive and immediately expect that the patient is ready, the nurse has everything ready to go, and that this should be relatively painless. Then when the nurse appears to be unprepared or the patient isn't ready you think ""unprofessional"", ""lazy"", and/or ""incompetent"", roll your eyes, give the nurses shit, then load your patient and go. You think to yourself ""its scheduled, how the hell did the nurse not get that patient ready?"". Then you come onto reddit and post things like this out of frustration or bewilderment.  Now from the nurses perspective things go a bit differently. Maybe the floor you're working on is the one you normally work on or maybe you floated up there and have no idea about the population of patients up there. At my hospital its not uncommon for nurses to float for 4 hours on one floor and 4 hours on another floor in the course of their shift. Each one of these floors can assign a nurse anywhere from two if they are pretty sick/needy to upwards of 4 or 5 patients. So if you get shafted as a nurse you can be responsible for receiving up to ten reports on patients in a single 8 hour shift. But lets say its a good day and you get assigned three patients for your 8-12 hour shift.   Then there is actually getting the report and sometimes nurses give some shit reports either because there are shitty nurses out there (just like there are shitty paramedics/EMTs) or because during their shift they ran around all day and didnt have time to go digging into charts to get every single medical condition or the full story on what's going on with them. It's just not practical to spend time on that if you're getting really busy. But let's say I got a good report on my three patients and I'm prepared that way.  Now to discharge or transfer someone there is usually a lot of hoops to jump through. If your lucky the nurse before you did some leg work if not you have to type or format discharge instructions, get doctors to sign prescriptions and input their discharge instructions, then you need to pack up their room, do patient education, and go over discharge medications. This all relies on other people doing their job otherwise the nurse has track down doctors, pharmacists, and other professions to make sure the patient has everything they need to go home. As you might imagine can be difficult to do in a busy hospital. But lets say the nurse from the shift hooked me up and all I really have to do is go over discharge education and medication because everything else is done.  Well now lets go back to those two patients who aren't discharging and are in the hospital. Depending on the floor/department you work in these two patients can have you running around all day long. Between medications (pain meds every hour, etc.), patient conditions (alcohol withdrawal, neurologically impaired patients who are impulsive and get out of bed, or needy patients that are anxious or think that their my only patient) and all the other small requests I get as a nurse all day long a 12 hour shift can fly by and by the time I sit down to chart its almost time to go. Unfortunately my other patients dont understand that EMS is going to be here at noon so please dont hit the call light, or ask for pain meds, or start to get agitated because I need to be ready and waiting for EMS.  I do everything I can to be ready for EMS if they are scheduled to come and pick up my patients but the patient has more say in my plan for the day then I do. Even if I have a plan of attack to have a patient ready by whatever scheduled time your supposed to be there it rarely makes it past the first hour of my shift.  So please, next time you come for an IFT at a hospital and the nurse seems in disarray or doesnt have the most complete report for you to just rattle off the top of their head try to have a little understanding into their job. We can get fucking busy and we constantly have to prioritize what patients we see first and which ones wait and sometimes the patient that waits is the one you are here to pick up. I never truly understood just how busy a nurse was until I went back to school to become a nurse. Before that I assumed they were just lazy or incompetent when I worked as EMT. So hopefully that gives you a little perspective and next time you run into this you have a little patience or understanding."

ems,3dybsm,kelvin_klein_bottle,0,Tue Jul 21 02:52:48 2015 UTC,I understand getting busy but it seems like most of the time they do nothing until we get there. We show up and get the oh great your here let me do the paperwork(for a pre scheduled call). You then sit for over an hour sometimes before you see a face sheet. It's the hospital that calls out the pre schedule call not us. They say be here at 1400. They act like their time is more valuable than ours. If you don't have anything ready call back up and push back the call. If we have to get taken off a call weve been waiting for a while the nurses will get upset.  I have no problem waiting a while for paperwork when its 1-2 things and understand getting busy but to take advantage of that and make us wait for extended periods bc you haven't done your paperwork yet or had someone call to change the call to a better time is pretty shitty. I've had to wait for a pt to get an NG tube that was supposed to get put in at 0800 once and it's now 1800 and the Dr didn't show up. While it's not the rns fault he hasn't been there yet they should have called up to cancel or push back the call.   That why I think there is that little bit of animosity. We don't feel respected and get jerked around.
ems,3dybsm,trapper2530,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah I understand that. Each floor operates differently even within a hospital so I can't speak for all but on mine they ask the nurse when they think they can discharge a patient and schedule around that. The thing is shit happens and I imagine a lot of nurses don't feel they can cancel transport once it's set. It's really tricky. Sometimes it's little bull shit that holds the show and sometimes it's something like the doctor hasn't been up yet to sign off on the discharge stuff.   The point I'm trying to make is that transferring or discharging out of a hospital, if done well, is not a simple task. Most nurses don't have a clue how EMS dispatch works and most of EMS doesn't understand how thin a nurse can be stretched."

ems,3dzbea,Johnathan_EMT,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:23 2015 UTC,Its a Ford E series problem.  The AC units aren't powerful enough to keep the ambulance cool and almost any time you et above 2500 RPM they AC switches from the passenger vents to the windshield vent for about 5 minutes.  Sounds like you work at the same location I do bc they don't seem to give a shit either… especially when its 105+ degrees out.

ems,3dysow,_Shawzuu_,11,Mon Jul 20 17:10:22 2015 UTC,Bit of a poor survey. As you can answer yes to almost all of the transport reasons apart from psych.

ems,3dysow,McKnight13,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah those reasons sound a lot more like EMD categories than transport criteria. Chest pain, for example, could be a STEMI or could be pleuritic with a normal EKG. Trauma could be spinal tenderness or multi-system with AMS. It all depends on the situation."
ems,3dysow,pedanticlobster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:38 2015 UTC,Yeah surprisingly though different jurisdictions have different protocols in terms of that. That's one of the things I actually wanted to find out.  Thank you for your feedback though!
ems,3dysow,cjgny,6,Mon Jul 20 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"I am curious as to the goal of this survey ...   its very badly worded in my opinion.    How much time do you feel you save by transporting lights and sirens?   You really need to know who is answering to get any actual meaning out of that question. Heck , even time of day plays a factor.   Even the rules of the agency come into play as many apply limits to how much you can exceed the speed limit.   Never mind the fact that use of sirens could vary during the transport. 3 am on a twisty rural road where I am staying within the speed limit ( following the law )  anyway , I might not make any noise. But decide to ( am required to here in NY ) make some noise to pass a red light.   There is no hard and fast rule of when you use them. It completely depends on the situation."
ems,3dysow,Sensual_Sandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"Since the point of the survey is the effects of lights and sirens, the questions makes sense because they want to know how lights and sirens affects response times"

The question I quoted was    How much time do you feel you save by transporting lights and sirens?    I read that as asking the driver about their perceptions not about actual facts.  Subtle but important difference.   Like I said , in my opinion ,  its a badly worded survey."
ems,3dysow,festizian,4,Tue Jul 21 12:55:03 2015 UTC,That first question is just...nonsensical. None of those except for cardiac or respiratory arrest are cut and dry L&S or no L&S.

ems,3dysow,festizian,2,Mon Jul 20 22:32:37 2015 UTC,"Chest pain can be a lot of stuff that isn't life threatening. Without a lot more information such as vitals, patient condition, a descriptor of the pain, etc., I can't make a determination as to whether the patient's outcome would be benefitted by the extra fraction of time lights and sirens gives us. I've transported GSWs non-emergency before. Everything is subjective, and I don't drive lights and sirens unless really necessary."
ems,3dysow,JshWright,5,Mon Jul 20 22:35:50 2015 UTC,"""Chest Pain"" should probably be ""STEMI"", and I would add ""Stroke"" to that list.  The time saved question is not terribly it. Saving 1-2 minutes off a 5 minute transport is a lot different than saving 1-2 minutes off a 30 minute transport. It would probably be better expressed as a percentage.  Two questions are combined into one with the ""Do you drive, and were you trained?"" question. A 'No' answer means two different things, therefore the question is useless."
ems,3dysow,climberslacker,3,Mon Jul 20 20:57:17 2015 UTC,I started the survey but couldn't figure out how to answer the questions. If I feel that the benefits of traveling L&S outweigh the risks both the the patient and others traveling on the road I will go with lights on. Otherwise no. Will I take all chest pain patients in with lights? HELL NO! Will I take some? Of course!
ems,3dysow,masterofcreases,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"Saving time running L&S can change drastically between services.  I work in a city and it saves a decent chunk of time, but I can imagine out on rural areas it doesn't make much of a difference."
ems,3dysow,zombiesammich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:32 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised. The service I work in is technically rural, and every legit call (stemi, stroke, gsw, stab, etc) has to be transported out. The trauma center is ~25 minutes going code 3, and closer to 35 without lights. We still have to go through a long stretch of traffic congestion, and using the lights early really does shave off a lot of time.  In the city though? Meh. Our hospital is centrally located, and you could realistically get to the hospital within 8 minutes from anywhere without lights."
ems,3dz5ks,Fattybitchtits,8,Mon Jul 20 18:39:21 2015 UTC,"The reason most bls folks dont use it is because they either don't know about it, or realize that it can be somewhat dangerous to do without a cardiac monitor.  The thing is, you have to consider why they're tachicardic. Dehydration? Fever? Just finished strenuous movement? Hemorraging? All of these are natural situations to be tachicardic.  Vagal manuvers are indicated if a pt is in SVT. And it's pretty hard/impossible to tell if someone is in SVT if you don't have a monitor."

ems,3dz5ks,Turborg,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"Interpretation of EKGs is considered an ALS skill in the US.  Placement and collection of a 4 or 12 lead is BLS though, and you're not really allowed to do anything with it.    I will connect and run a 4 lead regardless of whether or not I have a medic on the truck, and will hand it to the doc at the hospital; particularly on any patient with cardiac risk or signs/symptoms that may be indicative of something cardiac.  The doc's love getting handed a prehospital EKG, even if the provider doing so is BLS and can't give a diagnosis or a STEMI alert."

ems,3dz5ks,MacAndTheBoys,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"There's definitely some inherent risk. Depending on how you are attempting them. The carotid massage can kill someone, so I wouldn't recommend it. In my experience I've tried Vagal maneuvers on every svt patient I've had and never had it work once.   You are spot on. It's dependent on why they are in that rhythm. The septic patient is not likely going to convert even if you hit them with the juice. Why? Because it's not being caused by a conduction pathway malfunction. It's a reaction to the systemic infection. Until you fix that they will tach out.   I will say this though. My most recent svt patient was fucking textbook. Patient was taking a shit when she said her chest started hurting and she thought she was going to die. Call went out as chest pain. She's ao x 4. Walk in and immediately I assume it's a BLS call. Nope. Can't get a BP, can't get radial pulses. And her pulse was in the 170s. Still totally asymptomatic patient. I got next to no history from her. She knew she had a cardiac history but didn't know what it was. Later turned out she had a history of svt and had required cardioversion multiple times in the past. So she was the ideal candidate for vagal/adenosine. As the cause was readily identifiable (at least later when we got the proper history). Vagals did nothing. I had her blow on a syringe without the plunger. No good. 6 MG adenosine was all it took to convert. 500 ml fluid bolus got her pressures back up to normal. She was discharged from the hospital within a few hours.   I've never had it be more text book than that. Every other patient was completely unaffected by the adenosine or simply converted on their own. One patient stood up after being at the hospital for hours in afib with rvr. Right before they were getting ready to sedate and cardiovert.  Bam. Conversion."

Further reading: lifeinthefastlane.com/valsalva-manoeuvre-physiology-bscc/  In a nutshell I take pt from standing or sitting position to modified trendelenburg (supine with legs raised) and get them to blow HARD into a 10mL syringe with the goal of moving the plunger.

I believe that if you want to make a career of this, you absolutely must be able to talk to your partner about the details of your job. I am a combat wounded veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan. My wife, obviously, wasn't there. I can still talk to her about my experiences. She has not had the same experiences, but she can empathize with me and it allows her to understand what is going on in my world. The same thing goes for EMS. Your SO may very well never know what it is like to run a cardiac arrest on a child, but that doesn't mean that you can not talk to them about it. You must be able to relate such a large portion of your life to your partner. If your partner can not handle that part of your life, you either need a new career or a new partner, because its not going to go well.   Alcohol is a horrible coping mechanism. You think you feel down in the dumps after a bad call, you won't feel better after half a bottle of Jack, trust me. Find a healthy out let, for me its exercise. I find the best way to clear my head after a hard shift is a good run. Let the endorphins do their job.  Keep in mind that you are 19, and have seen exactly 0% of the world. You WILL see things that are going to shock you and change your outlook on life. This is not a bad thing. Don't be ashamed of any of your emotions, and don't think that you aren't cut out for this  if find yourself overwhelmed. My advice to you is to find someone that you can confide in and a healthy outlet for stress. That someone to confide in does not have to be in EMS, it can be anyone that you can have open and honest communication with."

It makes you so fucking mad that people can be this way to other people. That there's someone walking around right now that can say he killed a 3 year old and riddled his mother with bullets.   Personally I don't share stuff like that with family or friends. I keep that between me and other Healthcare providers. But you do need to share it. Because it's fucked up. And you can't sit on stuff like that. It will rip you apart in no time.   But you know what. Even though we couldn't save that boy. Knowing that we did what we could.

It shows that you anticipate placing yourself in situations where stabbings or shootings are a foreseeable risk. Thats not our job, thats what police are for. Nothing in my duty to act is more important than my and my crew's personal safety. De-escaltion, avoidance, and retreat should be far above body armor. Now, I do understand that we may find ourselves in danger despite these efforts. I do not believe personally that the risk warrants purchase of and wearing of body armor. I have worn that stuff enough, and it sucks. Try working a class one in the summer while wearing a vest. Inevitably, all the medics I know that have bought their own vest do not wear it every day, and on every call. If you are concerned that any scene may turn dangerous, then you have to wear it every shift, all shift long. I just don't see it as practical. I think more than anything, it gives a false sense of security and causes people to push a bad situation further than they should because in their mind they are thinking ""its ok, I'm wearing a vest""."
ems,3dy0p6,Medic7816,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"The only way I would wear it is if it is free. And not for safety purposes either, just to hide my dad bod from the nurses.

The lead medic is standing approx 6ft from an obviously aggressive psych pt that his coworkers are maceing... Stop trying to be a hero and get back in your fucking truck.  There are two types of danger in ems, danger that is observable on scene and enables the ability to use proper precautions ( protective equipment, staging, police etc )  And unforeseable danger that kicks off in the moment. In most of cases you will not have the time or ability to get the resources required to deal with the situation in a timely manner and the best solution is to remove yourself from the scene. Otherwise you just become another patient.  It becomes a grey area when you arrive first and civilians are on-scene. But the best way to deal with that is to encourage them to self evacuate, not to try and deal with the threat yourself."

Having a band-aid bag isn't a bad idea, but in any area with decent service is largely useless. If you do have one (and I'm not discouraging you from it) keep it simple. Tape, gauze, ice packs and ace wraps. Anything beyond that and you're either carrying too much or risking your cert over some bs.

ems,3dvrs2,forkandbowl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:28:30 2015 UTC,Yeah we typically have one on the stretcher and one on the airway bag (where are two bottle are).   I used to work at AMR which had all tabs which was great.
ems,3dukx9,IHSigV,9,Sun Jul 19 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Medic student. Remember these folks are still finding their groove and getting to the skills they need to write off on. They are not lead and certainly not ultimately responsible for this patient.  For me, if my partner was lead and was doing one thing I feel it's up to me to play off of him and do the other things. If they are getting a line ready then I am on the Os, secondary assessment, vitals..whichever."
ems,3dukx9,zombieron,19,Sun Jul 19 19:11:45 2015 UTC,"Preceptor. I know every system is different, but shouldn't an intern universally be leading the calls? That's the hard part about becoming a medic.  The point of the post (which I love) is to do a good assessment. Every patient. Every time. Yes, you'll know early in some calls you'll need to put an IV in, but what you learn assessing the patient should lead you to the decision to put in a line, etc."
ems,3dukx9,WellThatTickles,6,Sun Jul 19 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, and I think it's also important not to just learn how to take a good assessment every time, but also one that is appropriate targeted towards your patient's presentation and complaints.  The skill-sheet mentality of ""every patient gets X assessment"" isn't accurate. When I was in medic school, and even for some time when I started work, I found both sides of the spectrum difficult to grasp at first.  On one hand, learning how to take a proper ALS assessment was tricky; lot's more tools at our disposal and a lot more knowledge to which it goes along. Using that knowledge to ask the questions and put together the information to get a diagnosis took a long time to get good at.   At the same time, the opposite of overassessing and prioritizing is also an adjustment. Not every tool and trick up our sleeves is needed for every call. Does your 95 year old chest pain patient with a fever, wheezing with some rhonchi, tachycardia, mild hypotension, difficulty breathing, and a productive cough need a 12-lead? Maybe at some point, but the information given should be used to prioritize treatments (in this example, septic pneumonia is likely and my priorities are an IV, fluid bolus, and neb treatment). A 12-lead really isn't something I'm concerned about.  Good assessments go both ways, you can under-assess and you can over-assess. It's important to learn that balance."

Yes, yes they do. Doesn't mean I don't primarily suspect pneumonia, but CHF, MI, and others are still on my differential.    But I agree it's priority based, which is why I have a partner and firefighters to do the BLS stuff."
ems,3dukx9,linussy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not really sure I agree 100%. There is a fine line between medically indicated tests and defensive medicine / CYA. If the patient's entire presentation points to pneumonia and not a cardiac etiology, why are you focusing on cardiac tests?  To me, tests should be ran because your history and physical makes you suspect to find something in the results. Chest pain is not an indication to do a 12-lead; chest pain suspected of having a cardiac etiology is. Or take your patient who sprained his ankle walking and has pain in the area in the absence of any other complaints. Will checking lung sounds and pupils really tell you anything? Not really, no. So why are you doing it?  It's always taught ""every patient gets a full physical exam and assessment,"" while it should really be ""every patient gets an exam and assessment consistent with their presentation and complaints."" The question should always be ""what am I expecting to find using this tool or technique?"""
ems,3dukx9,MuffinMedic,2,Tue Jul 21 02:51:28 2015 UTC,"Confirmation bias is a dangerous thing.  There is no reason why a 95yo with chest pain, SOB, hypotension, and tachycardia should not get a 12lead, and that's exactly what they're going to get the minute you get them in to the ED.  (Barring a knife or GSW to the chest, that is)  Doing a 12lead doesn't mean you have to also pop ASA and NTG."
ems,3dukx9,linussy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"It's not confirmation bias, it's using a good hands on physical exam and history to determine what tests are needed and figure out the path you are going to take. Confirmation bias would be saying ""oh, old and SOB, must be PNA"" without completing your physical and history.  The 95 YO CP, HoTN, tacychardia, and SOB. Is a 12-lead needed? Maybe! That certainly sounds like it has the potential to be, but your physical isn't done. Add on the fever, productive cough w/ yellow sputum, and rhonchi for 3 days, and it starts to sound a lot more like an infection (PNA) and very little like a cardiac etiology.  If everything points to diagnosis A, why are you chasing B? Other than ""just to be safe,"" what are you expecting to find that a good history and physical clearly suggests otherwise?"
ems,3dukx9,MuffinMedic,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"It's not confirmation bias   It's exactly confirmation bias.  ""Oh, all this is present, so it can't be anything else, so further tests are not needed"".   Add on the fever, productive cough w/ yellow sputum, and rhonchi for 3 days,   Because sick people can't have an MI?   If everything points to diagnosis A, why are you chasing B?      That's the beauty of medicine:  The majority of symptoms described could be anything from an MI, to CHF, to pneumonia, to ARDS, to the flu. Again, just because you do a 12lead doesn't mean you believe it's cardiac, nor that you have to treat cardiac for doing the 12.  It's just getting one more puzzle piece to help make your determination.  This isn't a ""backboard everyone"" type of thing, it fits clinically."
ems,3dukx9,linussy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"Always do a good physical exam and follow your instincts, but you need to know your own limitations too:    A physician's clinical exam (that is, assessment without a chest x-ray) is only 50% sensitive for pneumonia.  ...That's an assessment  in a quiet office or hospital, by a physician, with the benefit of time and experience, and it's still a coin flip to make this diagnosis without imaging.  Pneumonia is hard, and I promise you that you are not doing better than 50% as a medic in the back of an ambulance.  Cost versus benefit.  It costs you nothing to do a 12 lead, but picking up a STEMI when you thought it was pneumonia is potentially worth someone's life.  Granted the 12 lead is not a screening tool, but nonetheless your threshold for taking one should be very, very low simply by virtue of the cost/benefit ratio.   Who says your septic/hypotensive patient can't also be having an acute cardiac event?  Hypotension and the circulating toxins found in sepsis don't exactly do the heart good, and sometimes it's a precipitating event like sepsis where underlying heart disease is revealed.  Respect for surprises.  How many times have you sworn a patient had X and they really turned out to have Y?  If you've been doing this for any time at all, you know that this kind of thing happens all the time.  ""Defensive medicine"" is a dirty word these days, but there is definite value in respecting the fact that an undifferentiated patient can truly have anything.  Don't ever fall into the trap of thinking that you don't have to look for the dangerous things.  You do."
ems,3dukx9,adenocard,7,Tue Jul 21 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"They are not lead and certainly not ultimately responsible for this patient.   As a preceptor, my ""ultimate responsibility"" is twofold:    The patient's well-being (you most certainly don't have to remind me that patient care is my responsibility, not my student's).  Teaching my student to do a proper assessment. You can get your IV sticks in the ER. The field is not the place to worry about those types of skills. The most valuable thing I can teach is assessment and assessment-based interventions (that is to say, when it's appropriate to start prepping for an IV, or any other intervention). If you've said five sentences to the patient and start to go for an IV, I am going to have to drop some remediation on you. Simple as that."

Some of the introversion will dissipate a bit once you start to gain some confidence. Don't feel like you're in the way, because you're not. Getting straight A's requires a particular skill set. Actually working in the field requires a completely different one, so don't be too hard on yourself if your talents don't transfer over right away. Just put those to brains to use and work on developing some new talents.  And as far as the driving goes, just focus on being safe. Lots of people have difficulty learning to drive the big boxes, and driving code 3 without taking an EVOC class is particularly tough. Just focus on getting from point A to point B without getting in a wreck. The lights and sirens and altered driving rules are just window dressing - you still need to drive carefully. Don't throw in the towel after a few weeks. If you're still having this much difficulty after six months then I'd reevaluate.

And every time they hit the same wall, they get flustered and go back to that same starting point to only go down the same road and then need hand-holding the the rest of the call. I hate it, I see a confident, happy student kick the shit out of themselves for this.   What you need to recognise is similar situations where you may have messed up previously. Then recall back to what you did last time and ask yourself ""Did this work?"" If not, then remember what your mentor or crewmate did that was different.   Tell your crewmate/s or mentor that you feel you're struggling in this regard. Assuming they aren't a salty-as-fuck old hand who couldn't care less, they will make an effort for you. I have all the time in the world for a student or newbie who says ""I'm really finding XYZ difficult, how can I improve?"" They should recognise when you're heading down an unfruitful line of questioning or when its time to advance the scene, go to the truck, perform an intervention etc and make it obvious. Make them differentiate it for you so you're aware of where you're going wrong. There is no point being mollycoddled and if mistakes are made they need to be pointed out and corrected. Not demeaningly, but constructively.   And things will get better with time. Experience is ultimately the best teacher.

I was in your same boat when I started. Hang in there, it took me a couple of years before I truly realized I could make it through any call."
ems,3dv316,d3jake,4,Sun Jul 19 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who's struggled with a lot of the stuff you wrote myself, let me offer some advice:  First: Take two deep breaths.  If you get inside your own head, you'll only make things worse for yourself.  Second: If you feel like you're having trouble driving the truck, there are a couple of tricks that can help you.  First of all, when backing a box truck, focus on lining up in ONE of the side mirrors, and use the other only to ensure that you're not about to hit something.  That way you can keep yourself going straight back.  Second, since you're on a Volunteer Department, talk to your Chief or other officers and see if there's training available for an EVOC or CEVO class.  It's unfair of them to hold you to a standard if you've never been trained.  Finally, the big one.  If you're driving Code 3 (responding lights and sirens), there's no reason to drive like a lunatic.  The lights and sirens are just to help clear traffic, not to give you permission to drive too fast or too recklessly.  Just focus on getting where you're trying to go.  On your Third point I'll point out something that was pointed out to me when I was training.  Having the book smarts gives you a leg up.  It really does.  Then, when you're actually interviewing a patient, consider the symptoms you're getting and start ruling out things you know could be causing them in order of most life threatening to least.  Knowing the book stuff helps to do that.  Treat the ABCs, then start investigating the complaint and get the story of what happened to them.  Any information is better than no information, and even little things could turn out to be useful at the hospital.  As far as being extroverted vs. introverted, don't forget the old adage -- Fake It till You Make It.  I didn't used to like talking to people.  But I pretended that I did until it didn't bother me any more, and now I rather enjoy making small talk with strangers.  Hope any of that was helpful.  Yeah, EMS might not be for everyone, but if you enjoy the work and it's what you want to do, you can do it."

This is something that reconates with me as well: I spent the first semester and a half of ride-alongs wishing desparately to hide in the little corner between the captain's chair, and the front wall/shelf of the box. Exposure is what's needed."
ems,3dv316,Sensual_Sandwich,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"Exposure, and understanding from your partners/ preceptors/ FTOs/ Officers.  EVERYONE's been there at some point or another.  No provider EVER came into the job at 100% efficiency or without things that needed to be worked on.  So having your coworkers understand that and not give you shit for it, but actually try to help you get better is invaluable."

ems,3dv316,thraway128,4,Tue Jul 21 05:23:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are working on an ALS rig out of school.   This is why I always argue to people that no matter what, you should start off working BLS IFT. IT doesn't matter if you were top of the class or bottom of the class, BLS IFT is a prime first step that every EMT should take for the following reasons:   You get to learn the layout of the city/county that you are working in. You'll get to know the ins and out of many of the streets, alleys, roads, different neighborhoods, etc...  You get to learn how to speak with your co-workers, nurses, and most importantly your patients! IFT you spend a lot of time doing a whole lot of nothing while you're teching (besides taking VS every 15 min). So why not use that time to talk with your patient, get to understand their medical condition and how their history, meds, and allergies are making them the way they are. As well as get to know them on a more personal level instead of treating them just like everyone else! I myself try to relate to all my patients as best as I can, I give kids stickers and talk about cool video games, I talk to people my age about colleges, outdoors stuff, and night life. If I am with the elderly I talk about what they did for fun in the past, places to go, and they always love giving that sweet life advice. Learn to talk with people and develop your own personal flavor besides salty! Find something that works for you. Just because one EMT/Medic does something specifically doesn't mean you have too. This is why I love working with different partners all the time. I pick out things I like that work for them and kind of combine them into my own way of how I work!   Once you get the idea of how to work effectively in BLS IFT and you feel you have plateaued, you'll begin to crave the idea of learning more and becoming a better EMT. Move up to ALS IFT and learn how to do a proper 12 lead, understand what drugs medics give, how they are given, and why they are given, begin working a bit more fast paced. ""Oh what we have a Code 3 Chest Pain call at that SNF at Grove/Baker? Thank god I know the in's and out's of the cities layout from my time in BLS because I know the fastest way to get there!""   Once you do ALS IFT you will probably want to bump up to ALS 911 and transfer all your previous BLS/ALS IFT knowledge and apply it there! By then you'll already know all the cardiac, stroke, trauma, and children receiving hospitals (dependig on your county this will vary), you'll know what meds to assist your medic with, fastest routes, etc....  The biggest thing to take from what I am saying is to build a good foundation and grow off of that! You wouldn't build a house without a foundation right? Yea maybe if your an expert like Tim the Tool Man Taylor from Home Improvement. But if your like most other people, building that solid foundation will last you throughout your career.  Everyone makes mistakes, even the 20 year veteran medic at your company had to start somewhere. If some salty dude is giving you a hard time for a mistake you made or you're not living up to his/her standards, then learn from it and improve yourself, don't become salty just learn to improve yourself.  I feel like I butchered the hell out of this comment but I hope you understand where I am coming from. And if anyone else would like to add onto or critique please do!"
ems,3dv316,kreigan29,2,Sun Jul 19 20:43:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. But in my area there are no solely BLS/ALS IFT jobs/rigs. It's all ALS rigs that take both 911s and BLS/ALS IFTs....
ems,3dv316,beerpls,2,Sun Jul 19 21:57:01 2015 UTC,Wow. That's a well-funded area.
ems,3dv316,reggae_muffin,4,Sun Jul 19 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"As someone who has been both the brand new EMT introvert and a field training I will try and give you some advise.  First and most important imho getting past the introvertness.  I don't mean completely change your personality but start small.  Start striking up conversations in places where you normally would be silent, grocery store, in line for food.  Places were your interaction can be brief and the chances you will see the person again are small.  With patients talk to them has you would talk to a family member minus vulgarities.  For me first questions I always ask is how they are doing today.  Yeah it seems like a dumb question, but how they answer gives you a lot of answers.  Don't worry about messing up you can get better.  If they are not a frequent flier the chances of you seeing them again are remote so if you mess up no biggy, in terms of talking.  Don't let it get to you it takes practice and time like anything else that's why we have training periods. To be more assertive, be the first in the room and start asking question before hour partners.  Just ask them to help if you get stuck on a line of questioning.  Don't wordy about getting in the way, I would rather a trainee get in the way in a attempt to get better and me have to stop or correct them than the stand back and not do anything.  Next practice with your equipment ask your trainers if you can practice putting stuff together during down time.  Remember fast is slow and slow is fast.  Until you get comfortable doing something if you try to speed through it you will mess up then try to go faster since you messed up and then you are done for.  Take you time to set things up right the first time.  We all have stories of putting equipment together wrong.  Second you are new on the streets so I am glad you have no idea what you are doing.  That gives something to work with, would rather have someone who admits they don't know than someone who thinks they do.  Study your protocols for basic level when you have those study the protocols for paramedics.  Your job as a basic is to make the medic look good.  I work with strong basics who know every protocol so when I need something they are already getting it out.  That will take time but don't worry.  Ask your partners how they come to their treatment or diagnosis.  I have yet to meet a medic who isnt willing to show you how they did something. If you are stuck just start talking to the patient ask them anything you can thing of about what is wrong, then just talk try and put them at ease, joke with them, and get to know them if they are willing.  There are a lot of interesting people out there. Being great in class has almost no bearing on being good on the street.  I have know more than a few people who were great students and super smart who could do the job.  Get use to the bumps in the road when listening pressures.  Learn what a faint pressure sounds like in a noiseless environment so you can learn to separate it in a noisy one.  Ask coworkers for tips and tricks.    Third quick find a way to take EVOC or CEVO.  They will build your confidence."
ems,3dv316,skyraseal,5,Sun Jul 19 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"I tell every student the same thing: fake it till you make it.   As for driving, EVOC won't do diddly. Adjust your mirrors, adjust your seat. Practice backing your personal vehicle.   Now, in 6 months, if you still aren't getting it, maybe reconsider. Get into the suck of IFT."
ems,3dv316,mcpaddy,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, a lot of this stuff just comes with a bit of practice that will help you gain some confidence. Everyone feels nervous and like they're floundering at some point when they start out. Is there anyone in your service that you feel like you could go to for extra practice (like taking BPs, or even going through scenarios)? Try and focus in on a couple things to work on at a time and eventually they turn into habit - make things more manageable for yourself so you don't feel like you're drowning.   In terms of the driving, take the EVOC course. Its not going to magically turn you into some ace driver but at least you'll have a better idea of what it means to drive an emergency vehicle. Otherwise, it just comes with practice. Volunteer to drive as much as possible in non-emergent situations so that when it is finally lights & sirens you have extra hours behind the wheel."
ems,3dv316,AlaskanEMT,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"Hey man. Thanks for posting this. I feel like I'm in the exact same situation (people also ask me why I don't talk, and I'm not proactive enough with questions because I can never think of any). I do well in class, but in my ride alongs I blank out a lot when trying to deal with patients. Heck I struggle to put on a BP cuff while my preceptor does it in one swift move.  People here have given a lot of good advice, keep working on it!"
ems,3dv316,VortexMagus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:12 2015 UTC,"As far as emergency driving goes, just pretend like you're driving normally (non-emergent). Going code doesn't even save a huge amount of time, so take the extra 30 second response time, slow down, yield to all other traffic, and just pretend like you're in your own car, but the traffic gets out of your way. Red lights are still stop signs."
ems,3dv316,jinkazetsukai,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:02 2015 UTC,"Alright, if you don't think your good enough in the real world, but your book smart. Then become an instructor. I know some awesome instructors, but not so great EMTs.   Also, you're new. You're going to make mistakes. Talk with your crew. Tell them you think you need to practice more, or ask them if you can take lead next call.   As an ambulance driver, safety if top priority. And remember, an ambulance is not like a car. Its top heavy, turn corners slowly. They start slow and stop slow. Above all, relax. Sounds like your anxiety is shooting through the roof. Take some deep breath. Get your heart down, and your head clear. You'll get better with experience."
ems,3dv316,jerm088,2,Mon Jul 20 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"I had (or still have) all these problems at one point or another.  1) On Blood Pressure: Blood pressure is actually one of the more difficult to acquire skills, in my opinion. It's fucking mindlessly easy in EMT schools/programs because you're doing other students, who tend to be young and healthy, with vigorous hearts, in a relatively quiet classroom. You're not trying to dig through six or seven layers of flabby fat/muscle to get a bead on the pulse, or an 86 year old with the quietest heart north america, while in the back of an ambulance bumping around every pothole and vibrating with the thrum of the diesel engine.   Accuracy and surety in taking difficult blood pressures in the worst situations come after months and months of work, and thousands of patients, not weeks. Until then, do the best you can and double check it via palp if you're not sure.  2) On Expectations: If you're bouncing around partners and instructors, then you're probably going to have all sorts of adaptation issues, since each set of partners has their own expectations and their own rhythm. Once you get a single partner (or group of partners on a regular shift), they will make it very clear what their expectations are, and you will eventually adapt to fulfilling them. I had a lot of problems when I first started because some partners were super fast and rushed the shit out of me, and some partners were super slow and got pissy when I rushed them in the same way, for example. When you're only with yourself and one other guy in the ambulance, there's only one set of expectations to adapt to and it is much easier, especially after a few weeks of it.  3) Wtf, Driving? Also, doesn't your company require you to work for a few months before you start driving? Our company keeps us on paperwork/back of the rig for several months before we start on supervised driving - it gives you time to settle in to all the intricacies of the call before you take the lead in the driver's seat. They're just dropping you off the deep end in both roles on an ambulance, before you've even really settled into one?  4) Confidence and taking charge comes with familiarity. You don't magically get confident in a few days, you get confident after you've worked for a few months and can recite the particulars of most calls in your sleep.     What really helped me was when my partner took me aside and wrote a template for what he expected me to do in emergency calls. It went something like, upon arrival, get X information from nurse or family, get signatures, find driver and inform him of any contact isolations and patient quirks, help assess patient afterwards, check if patient needs oxygen by looking at pulse oximeter, prepare stretcher, move patient onto stretcher, secure patient in rig, give courtesy call + report to hospital en route, make sure patient vitals remain stable, etc and so forth. It was a lot more detailed than that, but you get the gist of it.  If you're having difficulty, I suggest making a checklist or a template for yourself of how a call should go, and then consulting it whenever you're stuck. Even if you've missed something and are not doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing at that exact moment, you're doing something useful, which is much, much better than nothing at all."

This may not help you, but it's been helping me, so I'll post it here: write.   I've been writing out conversations, descrptions of procedures, basically just giving myself a script to follow in various situations. I feel really awkward talking to new people if I'm not sure what to say, so to counteract it I started doing this. It makes me feel more prepared and confident, so even if the situation changes or is different than I thought it would be, I feel like I can handle it.

Now, I can bullshit most anyone. Like someone else said, it will take a good year to get comfortable...maybe two if you're not that busy. Knowing what questions to ask and what direction you should be heading with treatment is kind of like muscle memory. I used to put my gloves on and write SAMPLE and OPQRST on them to remind myself what to ask on certain runs but after a while, questions will come naturally, and you won't ask the unnecessary ones like asking a diabetic pt when her LMP was.   It gets easier. Driving will get better with experience. Just don't rush. This isn't the movies. Unless it's a pediatric arrest, or maybe a shooting/cutting...I pretty much drive normal speed with my lights and sirens on. Backing up will get easier with experience. Any good FTO knows you're not gonna be perfect fresh out of school. We were all there at one point. There is an occasional fuckface that thinks they were born with a stethoscope around their neck and expects you to be as awesome as them on your first shift. You'll find out that they are usually the most worthless medics out there.  99% of your runs are gonna be non life threatening runs. Use those to practice with. Take your time to get things right and eventually, it will come naturally in the most stressful of situations. I think we have all been at the spot you're at right now...I know I was...but it will pass and you'll grow to love it...and then hate it.....and then love it again. Good luck."

He's a very timid driver and his patient assessment is not great. However, this is the case with any brand new employee in EMS, even if they have been trained to the Paramedic level before being hired. There is SO much to learn, it takes a while to get the hang of things. Keep a positive mental attitude and your ""rookie mistakes"" will eventually disappear because it takes experience to get comfortable with things. Things like SAMPLE and OPQRST seem simple but can be quite awkward if they aren't done effortlessly. Check out some videos on how to obtain a blood pressure just to refresh yourself. There's a good chance you're not placing your stethoscope in the right place. Find the brachial artery before you start inflating the cuff. Don't give up. Show up to work everyday with a smile on your face. Know where everything is in your truck. Ask questions when you don't know what to do. We were all in your shoes at one time, whether people admit it or not. Being new in EMS is hard. Keep up the good work."
ems,3dv316,Raincoats_George,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:52:11 2015 UTC,"I usually need to be told to do something like put someone on Oxygen or set up an IV or take a blood glucose reading. I know what my skills are that I'm supposed to do but I'm not at all proactive when it comes to doing them.   Honestly, imo that's a pretty big red flag.  I might catch flak for this, but I feel like it's not fair for EMT-B's that run in BLS/BLS ALS/ALS tiered systems to be given so much responsibility with so little education. Especially so little clinicals. As one of the other responses said, it usually takes a year for Basics in a busy 911 setting to find their feet. Because you need patient contacts, and you need to build your internal catalog of patient encounters and presentations.  Also sounds like you have technical difficulty with basic skills, which is a red flag as well.  That said, the red flags aren't insurmountable. 15 days is not a lot of time. That's maybe 200 patients? Assuming you work in a very busy system, and of those you probably only transported a fraction. I had literally thousands of patient contacts before things started going smoothly for me.  Identifying you have a problem is a good first step. Learn more medicine. Buy a paramedic book and start reading it, even if you have no ambition to go medic. Memorizing protocols is for chumps. Knowing the medical reasons why x protocol is for y condition is how you provide good patient care. Debrief your calls with your sup/partner. Or even just with yourself. Go over what you did well, and what you did poorly and what you need to do to improve. And give it at least a couple months."

I don't really have access to a reliable thermometer on the units (the temporal gun in a joke), so I'm pretty much forced to rely on my symptomatic assessment for suspected fevers/hypothermia/hyperthermia.   Unfortunately I cannot feel fine temperature differences, so I've missed some pretty impressive temperatures.  95 (rectal at hospital) was my low as he was nearly asymptomatic (otherwise unexplained shortness of breath, slightly altered, ETOH intoxication, but had been indoors in own apartment in fall weather).   My highs are 103 (adult) and 104 (child).  I'm a little fuzzy on the adult, but I don't remember anything standing out but general weakness.  The child had brief seizure-like activity(reported by mother) and respiratory difficulty that resolved on its own, and I wasn't able to connect the dots till we got a temperature at the hospital.

The splint applies traction helping to keep anatomical alignment. One of the major causes of pain and secondary injury is muscle spam around the area of the break. The traction helps to limit the frequency and severity of these spasms. Believe it or not, the pain of these fractures is greatly reduced by simply applying traction.   Once the pt arrives at the hospital they will be placed into a Thomas Half-Ring splint until they either get skeletal traction or go to the OR for a nail.   P.S. While the Femur may be one of the strongest bones in the body, that is meant in a compression angle of force. A lateral angle will snap it like a twig."

The problem is, you still need the capability to provide fire protection services...  Whether you're fighting a fire a day, or a fire a month, you still need the ability to respond to a fire 24/7/365..."
ems,3dnt4r,JshWright,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly. 24 / 7 yes, but in relation to the actual demand.  The problem isn't that anyone want's to get rid of the fire service completely. It's that you have to have a sustainable model. Everything is a risk assessment, there is always a chance that a fire comes along that local resource can't handle. The trick is finding the right balance. Right now, over 80% of public safety calls are police and EMS. Therefore the distribution of public safety money should reflect that. If fire service can't be provided with what's left, volunteerism comes in. (But also the question of WHY, why can't they do the job with a share of the money that reflects the actual use of the service?) This is because we have to deal with actual demand and not ""what if's"".  This IS a zero sum game. There is only so much money, and there just isn't an argument any more for a majority of it to go to fire departments. You can take a look at the plummeting fire rates at FEMA.gov. They aren't plummeting because FD's are putting them out, this is fires that never start. Some of that is public education, fire inspections, and lots of other great stuff that FD's do. But most of it is due to new building materials, regulations, health and safety regulations, etc.  I want the FD around. And ideal I don't want any FF's to lose their jobs. But if the choice is between paying more EMS professionals, and paying those here already more or FD budgets and salaries, the choice is clear based on the actuality of demand. Not the fear that demand may arise in the future that we can't meet."
ems,3dnt4r,JshWright,2,Sat Jul 18 02:28:43 2015 UTC,"The relative frequency of calls isn't especially relevant. Just because there are fewer fires doesn't mean it requires less manpower to deal with them. Going from one fire a week to one fire a month is a 75% reduction in fire frequency, but that doesn't mean you can go from four guys on a truck to one.  Structure fires are low frequency, high impact events, that require a prompt response. Additionally fire departments typically provide various technical rescue services (MVAs, confined space, HazMat, etc). Again, all low frequency, high impact events that you can't really short staff, despite their relative infrequency."
ems,3dnt4r,JshWright,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"But that's just it, they aren't.  In addition to the prevelance the severety has greatly decreased. Fire doors, construction materials, sprinkler and early warning systems have all made it so that it's much easier than it was 30 years ago.  The future developments of things like inert gas grenades, portable imaging systems that can detect the presence and location of people from outside a building, etc. are changing things.  There is no industry in the world where what you are saying is true. Times change, you change with them or you get left behind. This article is one example of that happening. It's going to continue. If what you are saying is true, that wouldn't have happened. But it's not true."
ems,3dnt4r,kelvin_klein_bottle,3,Sat Jul 18 23:21:30 2015 UTC,"Just so we're on the same page, do you have any experience with structural firefighting?  Residential structure fires have, if anything, become more intense over the past 30 years. Lightweight construction materials lead to faster fire spread and earlier collapse. The amount of petroleum in a normal house (in the form of plastics in couch cushions, rugs, etc) has only increased, resulting in much higher amounts of energy being released (the difference in BTUs released between an 'old fashioned' coil-spring/cotton mattress and a fancy new all foam mattress is absolutely staggering).  You are absolutely correct that technology and improved tactics are improving fireground productivity. However, we are still a long way from making a meaningful impact on how many firefighters you need to safely extinguish a fire (and effect a rescue, and protect exposures, and do the myriad of other things that fire departments do).  I don't think this is the trendsetting example you think it is... We're talking about an agency that runs fewer than 1,000 calls per year... This is not a model that would work in a 'real' city.  Personally, I'm a fan of the model used by my primary agency. We're a combination career/volunteer, fire/EMS department. We provide both fire protection (+ tech resuce, etc), as well as ALS transport. All of our career members are paramedic/firefighters, and we have volunteer members who are just fire, just EMS, or both. I think it's a model that works well in a suburban (or even semi-rural) area.  Our EMS service effectively subsidizes staffing for the fire side, which would otherwise be financially out of reach for a community like ours."
ems,3dnt4r,JshWright,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do, only volunteer though.  I don't disagree with what you're saying entirely and I support mixed departments as long as Paramedics are paid equally in every way to firefighting. The point isn't to destroy the Fire Department, but your argument that call volume is not a key factor holds no weight.  You contradict yourself by blowing off the closing of this department as not important... because of low call volume. That doesn't make sense with the other things you're saying.  I agree that the FD isn't going anywhere, but it is going to change, and it is going to shrink. And rightfully so. That money is needed elsewhere, and what you're saying about needing people is directly related to call volume. The fewer fires in an area the fewer personnel required to send enough people to a single incident at one time.   So what we will likely see is there being a flip. Rather than cities having many more engines than ambulances, cities will need many fewer engines to respond with the same strength to the fewer fires. That money will go to EMS agencies, or the EMS side of combined departments.  No one is saying that FD's are going to close and fire everyone (although as we see here that will happen in some places) but as people retire they will not be replaced. Non-Firefighting specific tasks will be turned over to EMS like extrication (see New Orleans EMS, and many places in Texas, plus many more), high angle rescue, etc.  I don't think many people that have jobs now have anything to worry about, but the future is a decline in the size, and financing of the FD. I don't know why people respond so harshly to this. Places in CA just closed down and contracted to Rural Metro basically saying if there isn't demand and people won't pay for it, we don't need firefighting. (Obviously voulnteer would come in where there just isn't demand.)  I don't know how anyone can imagine that FF (baring a social collapse) will stay the same or grow, it's been declining, what will turn that around?"
ems,3dnt4r,kelvin_klein_bottle,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"You contradict yourself by blowing off the closing of this department as not important... because of low call volume. That doesn't make sense with the other things you're saying.   My point about call volume is that this has likely always been an extremely low call volume department. Even in the 'heyday' of fire, this departments call volume likely looked about the same.   I don't know how anyone can imagine that FF (baring a social collapse) will stay the same or grow, it's been declining, what will turn that around?   I'm not saying that. I'm saying that at some point we will hit 'minimum fire' and no matter how infrequent fires become, you must have the staffing to fight the occasional fires that do occur.  I often refer to my agency as ""An EMS service that provides fire coverage"". I think that is a model that will grow in the future."
ems,3dnt4r,JshWright,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with all that. That's exactly what I imagine as well.  I think they won't even be EMS agencies I think they will be Public Safety Agencies with people cross trained in basic EMT, Law Enforcement, and Fire Fighting. Then people who like one area can specialize further. I think the public is starting to demand a more dynamic model and we will see things like Public Safety degrees popping up.  The way I see it, and this is all conjecture (not that everything else I wrote wasn't, it's all just my opinion), the public are demanding more medical and mental health competency from police, more medical competency from fire departments, and increased ability and professionalism (we suck at that) in EMS. I think the way to go about it is to combine them.  At the end of the day police academy, fire academy, and paramedic school combined would make just about the education required for a bachelors. Obviously not everyone would practice all three. I mean we would still need detectives that only do that, and HAZMAT that only does (or specializes due to the massive amount of knowledge you need) that. But the entry level should be competency and experience in all three.  Sunnyvale, CA has a system somewhat like this with the exception of ALS being separate. Which I could see working fine, if adding Paramedic school in is too much. EMT, Fire, and Police Academy would make a strong base.  Don't get me wrong, that's just the direction I think we should all go. But I know that it's a long shot to get everyone on board and that it would be a generational change.  Would be cool though, and I think cheaper and more efficient for the public."

Especially since I have had patients wake up just from bagging them for a minute or two with the plus being that they usually aren't violent like you get from pushing Narcan. Ventilating breaks the cycle of depressed respiration, CO build up, increased depression, more CO, etc. The patient lost consciousness from lack of oxygen, not the drug. Narcan is nice to use after you've given bagging a try/don't have the hands to manage it properly/when you are in a messed up situation when ya need to get out of there."

ems,3doe7j,firelion227,3,Fri Jul 17 22:42:19 2015 UTC,My recommendation is to learn dimensional analysis. Eliminating and cancelling units and putting them in the proper place is the easiest and most fool proof way of doing doses. The only thing you'll ever want to know after that (just to speed up your work) is desired dose over concentration.  .2mg/kg/min is your desired dose....lets say the person weighs 75 kg. Thats 15 mg/min.  Lets say you have 400 mg in 500 ml bag. Your Concentration is 400mg/500ml. Thats .8mg/ml.  Desired dose/concentration= 15mg/min / .8mg/ml = 18.75 ml/min  Pumps usually go by ml/hr. Theres 60 minutes in an hour. So 19/ml/min is 1140 ml/hr.  This is important. Start learning a method that works for you now. The last thing you want to be stuck on is numbers when doing a tough ped call.

ems,3doe7j,mintygood,2,Sat Jul 18 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"I would argue that you should check the formula and resultant calculations every single time, ideally with a colleague of equivalent skill.   It reduces drug / dose errors and if one does occur, you have another person to find out why and confirm your calculations or thought process.   I don't know why it is expected of medics or doctors or anyone to memories a big list of dosages. It's just asking for a drug error to happen, particularly in the high acuity scenario.   In my own experience, there are a large number of drugs I rarely use from the drugs pack and I wouldn't feel comfortable reciting the doses or volume off the top of my head. I know across the pond you guys get a lot more to play with so it'd be even worse in my opinion.  Check and test is what is expected in my service;    1) ""I want to give 0.5mg 1:10 Adrenaline IM""  hands over ampule to colleague after checking date, dose, drug etc   2) ""This is Adrenaline 1:10, in date etc"".

In order to do this the nailgun must allow itself to only fire when pressed firmly against a surface. To go full-auto just hold it lightly against the surface, but enough that it does depress the safety mechanism. Hold down the trigger and the gun will bounce up, when it hits the surface again, it will fire a second shot. This will kick the nailgun back up in the air, and when it comes back down a third shot will be fired. Rinse, wash, repeat.    http://www.spudfiles.com/spudtech_archive/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3649"

Engine requests a truck for extrication, and they spend at least 5 to 10 trying the pry and cut off the door. Finally, the captain asks the homeowner if the van is his and if he can move it.

So the truck was blocked from moving forward down the street by a pickup that didn't follow alternate side parking. They called for another ambulance to take their patient and bring her to the hospital.  I know how bad city streets can be. But at the same time, from the head-on photo shown, it looks like there's plenty of room on both sides for the truck to pass. Also, I'm assuming cars started backing up behind them, otherwise they could have reversed out of there.   I'm just curious as how they got stuck when a second ambulance made it to them fine and this truck eventually got to move too. It seems like either a case of truly stuck in a rut, or a bad driver."

ems,3dmog3,-iSqueezeAutists-,2,Fri Jul 17 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"1.Course is about 250 hours. Rutgers probably offers a class especially if they have a collegiate EMS like my school does I took mine over the summer at boston university about 8 weeks maybe less.   Yes if you take a summer class like i did. Check boston university Probably if Rutgers offers the class or somewhere else near. New Jersey and Mass are both National Registry curriculum states. You can take the class in mass or new Jersey and assuming you pass your practical and national registry written you will be a nationally registered EMT and will get direct reciprocity in all 50 states. Once you are nationally registered you can apply for a lisence in MA and or NJ. Ny and Minnesota are the only non NREMT states so their classes follow a slightly different curriculum but as a NREMT you still get reciprocity in these states. I'm in NY and nationally registered, had no problems getting my lisence.   Edit:  rutgers has its own ambulance but I don't know if it's student run like my school's. If it is student run I would highly reccomend joining. Collegiate ems is awesome even though you get so many intox calls.  Edit2: if you apply for a lisence in NJ shortly after you take your practical and written. You should have no problems. Do you plan on riding in Mass? If not you don't actually need a mass lisence at all."
ems,3dmog3,ghansie10,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"I actually am a student at Rutgers and work for Rutgers EMS. Its a paid job so you need at least a year of experience to work for Rutgers EMS. However, there are plenty of towns in the surrounding area that you can be a volunteer at. Theses towns would pay for the EMT class.  Rutgers does not teach the EMT class anymore but the local hospital (Robert Wood Johnson) does. There is also other places within driving distance of Rutgers that teach EMT classes."

NY isn't a national registry state and I got reciprocity no problem, but that might be because I had a recent practical and written. Mass just became a national registry state recently i.e. all new EMTs have to go through the national registry but old mass EMTs are still valid."

ems,3dl9sg,TrauMedic,7,Fri Jul 17 04:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yes! This has happened to me with the large 10G needles before too.  I use a scalpel to make a small cut to break the skin, then poke the needle through the cut. Much easier after that.  [My Theories] It's because the catheter is larger than the cutting surface of the needle. You'll see the flare of the catheter is quite large and balloons out from the needle. Or maybe the skin is too tough or elastic?"
ems,3dl9sg,slamchop,2,Fri Jul 17 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, great advice!"
ems,3dl9sg,SDAdam,4,Fri Jul 17 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, no I haven't heard of that.  It's possible that you inadvertently chose a site where the needle impacted a fatty or fibrous (benign) tumor that held things up. But those are cutting needles and I wouldn't expect THAT much resistance. I've never seen a catheter bunch up on a needle.  did you stabalize the needle and leave it in place? Where you able to inspect the cutting tip? My other thought and what seems more likely is that the needle was faulty and the there was an un-noticed defect in the tip resulting in a dull edge. Pretty crazy though!"
ems,3dl9sg,SDAdam,4,Fri Jul 17 05:38:14 2015 UTC,"So stabilized it in place and reassessed from there. Had some improvement in LS but still diminished with crap O2 sat.   Here's the thing... We figured ""well that didn't go perfect and it's not placed 100% correctly so let's do it again"". Located our second site midaxillary this time annnnnd... Same exact thing happened!! Same resistance, same needle bunching, same hulk amount of force to get it placed, and same questionable catheter advancement!   Completely different needle, location, and even a different medic. I mean it was like this kid had a bulletproof vest under his ribs."
ems,3dl9sg,SDAdam,2,Fri Jul 17 05:51:09 2015 UTC,"What. The. Heck.  That's just some damn craziness.  Any chance of follow up to see radiology? I'd love to know what the hell was going on. I tried to see if there are some kinds of diffuse fibrous diseases that effect the intercostals or thorax as a whole, but came up blank.  This is super interesting though. If you can follow up this would be publishable as a case study. I can't find anything even like it!"
ems,3dl9sg,SDAdam,2,Fri Jul 17 06:10:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll look into a follow up for sure just haven't gotten around to it yet. Seemed like a young healthy guy so I was expecting it to go in like butter. Looking back I'm wondering if the best course of action for the second attempt could have been pull the 10g out and insert a 14g? Same hole and it should drop right in to the hub since there was a larger diameter hole prior. We only carry 1 10g and the rest are 14g for decompression so I couldn't grab another for a second shot.
ems,3dl9sg,WC_Dirk_Gently,2,Fri Jul 17 06:26:07 2015 UTC,"Man, that's a great idea and a really tough call. On the one hand I feel like that would work, but on the other you risk losing it all together and not being able to re-establish. That really has to come down to your judgement in the moment. It's the kind of thing that if it worked, you're a genius, and if not, you're in trouble... hahaha!"
ems,3dl9sg,MedicUp,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"I have not personally encountered this, but I have heard of somewhat similar things happening with the 10ga's.  I think for the second attempt it would have been advisable to try it with a 14ga.  Also, was the second attempt midclavicular or axillary? It is entirely possible he had a lymphoma or similar in that area."

ems,3dndej,Brandwins,2,Fri Jul 17 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes. What do you do differently?  There is a logic behind the order in which things happen. Learning and practicing these 'scripts' is the bulk of what you learn in an EMT-B course. And once a provider is proficient, he should be able to fly through them in a 3-5 minutes."
ems,3dndej,GoldenBeaRR6,2,Fri Jul 17 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"Typically once most get the hang of it they deviate from it in a personalized way.   Plus, a lot of what's gathered from the Scene Size Up to the end of Primary Assessment is done just from observation without saying a word.   We're not robots, everyone does things at least a little differently, OP is asking what little deviations from the script work better or worse for some people.  If scriptreading was what we liked to do we'd be actors, not EMS personnel.   Plus, how things are taught in the book are very different from how they happen in reality, which would inspire people to develop their own ways of doing things."
ems,3dndej,Brandwins,2,Fri Jul 17 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too during my ride with veteran medics. I mentioned it to one particular medic when I noticed he didn't ask certain questions, and he chuckled while admitting most of the things he needs to know is done from observation.   People with certain conditions (trauma or medical) show patterns. Some signs and symptoms occur more than others, and after 10+ years, you automatically take notice. of course other questions must be asked so they can be written in the report. It comes with time."

ems,3dndej,RemoteProvider,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:00:11 2015 UTC,"I would respectfully disagree that all traumas show up naked.  Someone who is conscious and breaks an arm or a leg doesn't need to be stripped completely - I'm definitely going to palpate the rest of their body through their clothing and cut off that pant leg, but there's no reason to strip them if there's no indications for someone who never lost consciousness in that kind of situation."

ems,3dndej,climberslacker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Trauma I basically do:  ABCs/life threats  Detailed Physical Exam (expose, palpate, etc)  Vitals (can have partner do concurrent to PE)  Sample  Medical calls are the opposite order after ABCs.   The logic for that is that knowing what mess their on LIKELY won't have any effect on my immediate course of care for the trauma patient. I still want the info, sure, but right now I need to know what's bleeding and what's broken NOW. Similarly, a physical exam won't change that much of my course of treatment for my medical patient, but OPQRST/SAMPLE will give me TONS of relevant information to start working a differential diagnosis.   And your partner is right, having a routine is really really good for making sure you're not forgetting anything. It shouldn't be so concrete as to not be adaptable to the variety of patients but I will frequently catch myself reviewing my routine in my head to make sure I didn't forget to do/exam/ask anything. You can write it down even if that helps. Make a typical trauma patient and write down the order you want to do things. Same for medical. Maybe it won't help but I think it might.   Good luck, you'll do just fine out there with critical self reflection and an understanding of where to improve. Don't lose the heart of the learner. It'll serve you well."
ems,3dm4dd,WC_Dirk_Gently,8,Fri Jul 17 11:27:38 2015 UTC,"There are various aspects of an answer to this question.  Firstly, and probably most importantly; not all penetrating trauma to the chest will require decompression. A lot of it can be managed with a simple occlusive dressing with a valve.  However, this is complicated by the fact that a properly sealing and valving dressing can be difficult to apply/manage based on blood, sweat, equipment etc. But in theory a lot of chest wounds can be managed with proper burping alone.  But not all.   By nature, some traumatic wounds more readily allow air into the chest cavity than out. They will create somewhat of a one way valve. This is generally the situation in which a tension pneumo will occur. And typically are the ones that do so before your arrival as it can happen fast when the lumen is large enough to more readily allow air in than the trachea, but doesn't allow the same volume out. The other being a smaller caliber gsw, or knife injury can spontaneously seal from either clotting or edema, but if there is underlying damage to the lung air is still leaking internally to the chest cavity, but burping no longer is effective. These are generally the slower ones, as there won't be must progression to tension prior to your arrival, and depending on where the injury is on the lung, the internal leak may be small and slow.  Darting, in theory, creates a perfect lumen that will have no one way bias and allow the chest cavity to equalize in pressure with the atmosphere, which for some wounds may not be achievable with burping alone. And a lot of chest darting equipment includes features like Murphy's Eye's and collapse/bending resistant catheters to ensure the continued patency of the lumen. From which you can then to continue to burp and relieve the pressure if there is underlying injury to the lung.  TL;DR: darting only becomes necessary when there is underlying injury to the lung, and the lumen of the injury in the chest wall stops allowing air out, or you have a failure to properly apply a valved occlusive dressing.  The other situation being, of course, a non-open pneumo developing into a tension pneumo secondary to flail chest, rib fracture, Marfan's syndrome etc."

ems,3dm4dd,OurLadyofLourdes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't this be classified as an open pneumonthorax? I can understand doing a needle decompression for a tension pneumo, but if the pt receives a GSW to the chest and you use an occlusive dressing taped on 3 sides to bandage the wound, than you could essentially just burp it with out having to do a Needle Thoracostomy.   So I can see what OP means regarding putting another hole in the pt's chest.   Edit: WE_Dirk_Gently explains it better."

If you got in a crash and the kid wasn't in a car seat, you would be held liable- or the company would for telling you not to use the proper safety equipment. I don't understand the amount of times I've seen unsafe methods of transporting peds on non-emergency runs. If the patient truly cannot tolerate it, then you might need to look into alternatives, but I haven't run into that yet.

ems,3dl6lw,beerpls,5,Fri Jul 17 11:41:47 2015 UTC,"EMS is slowly evolving, but we do not have a strong national union to help push us to the tier that Fire and Police are on. FD have the IAFF and PD has the NAPO as well as a much more public relation with the public (Public addresses, award ceremonies, meeting the public while out and about. Whereas when EMS usually show up, whisk patients away to protect their privacy and I, for one, would be terrified to find myself in front of a camera.  That being said, I feel that EMS has changed since the days of Emergency!, in which a lot of culture is still the same (Radio straps, Tones, Button up uniform shirt etc.) but the care rendered by modern providers is miles ahead.  In almost every episode, they have to call Rampart for orders for their particular patient. Today, a paramedic can start an IV, Give Epinephrine, Diphenhydramine, and Solu-medrol through said IV. And if that doesn't work, they can give Etomidate and Succinylcholine and intubate a living albeit paralyzed patient. All without picking up a cell phone or tackle box radio (Depending on your regional protocols.)  We are providing better care for our patients than the days of Emergency!, even if it looks like we are doing the same song and dance."

The two career departments in my county always have their bunker pants on when they come out with us. With volunteers it's because they will show up in regular clothes so it's protection or something to identify them as firefighters.
ems,3dhorr,SteveBeev,21,Thu Jul 16 11:35:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I wear them on medical runs because I was hanging out in my most comfy shorts and boat shoes at the station.

ems,3dhorr,LordEyebrow,11,Thu Jul 16 11:51:34 2015 UTC,In my department we are allowed to wear shorts in the summer but have to but on our bunker pants when we leave the station. I tend to wear mine so I don't get bodily fluids on my station clothes.
ems,3dhorr,chewydive,8,Thu Jul 16 12:22:13 2015 UTC,"They were probably chilling in the station wearing gym shorts and taking a nap or something when the call got toned out. Put on your turn out pants to keep the fleas, bedbugs, and other filth you find in the lovely establishment we frequent from coming home with you. As for me pants are not enough, stripy tube socks that come to the knees (even in summer) are a must."
ems,3dhorr,sixdownandsixtogo,23,Thu Jul 16 13:00:01 2015 UTC,"I occasionally end up wearing turnouts on EMS calls, for a few different reasons:   The call requires it (wrecks, etc) I just walked in the door and haven't changed yet (throw on my bunkers and a job shirt to relieve someone) I was wearing them for some other reason when the call came in (training, just got back from a fire call, etc)   However, I'm on the rig, not 'first responding' to a medical call, so that's not 100% relevant to your question.  Why do 'first responders' do it? Two reasons:   There's not enough room in the back of the truck to carry everyone's bunkers, so it's easier to just wear them. If there is a call that requires bunker gear while you're out on the medical call, you don't want to have to pull over and change by the side of the road."

Other than that extra safety for car wrecks.  Usually it's only the new guys I see who wear them in on medicals or if the department has a mandate saying if you wear shorts or civilian bottoms (or are volunteer and wearing civilian bottoms) you must wear bunker pants.

And given that mentality does things that make for substandard care and care providers. An example being how the local counties all got together and decided that all firefighters must become emt intermediates. Which results in an influx of firefighters performing als skills with little to no interest in how or why it's done. And no attempts to keep current on research or best practices. Or how it's my understanding that firefighter associations are actively fighting the field ems bill.   That shit is obnoxious. But no. No hate.

Thus, I can't help but view the fire department as a threat to my livelihood.

ems,3dhorr,lonewolf13313,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"I only have experience with 2 stations.  At one station I have rarely even seen a fire fighter.  The only staff ever there are EMT's and medics.  We have had the occasional fire guy come in to ride with us, they are not trained as EMT's but they are an extra set of hands, know what to grab for the medic to set up and IV and are generally all cool guys I enjoy relaxing and chatting with.  The second station however has about 15 fire guys, 1 medic and 1 emt on shift.  Most of the fire guys have EMT training but its hard to get them to admit it and even harder to get them to help with anything more than a lift on scene.  If its not on fire its not worth the time.  Mind you they still respond on calls with you because they have to make it look like they are busy.  At the station it is made very clear that if you are not one of the fire guys this space isn't for you.  The last time I was there they were actually talking about selling one of the two ambulances they have and parking the other one outside so that they could get room for a fifth engine.  The bedrooms are also only for fire guys.  EMT and medics can crash on the couch when they work a 24.  There is also a lot of political fall out in some ares because fire is needed less and less but they dont want to lose funding to the medical side so some departments consider us the enemy.  These are some of the reasons there is some aggression in some areas."

Your inability to do what I do does not mean it isn't worth doing.  Interior firefighting saves lives and property every single day.  I'm guessing you've never even seen it done, let alone been inside a burning building.  Your statement is so utterly moronic that I'll end my response right there.

If you see her again, enjoy the time you have with a patient that is a nice, kind individual, and remember that when you have patients who kick and spit. If you are the type to be professional (Which should be everyone, but I digress), than every patient that you have, you will have had a relatively pleasant encounter.

ems,3dkozw,Brandwins,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:31:05 2015 UTC,What works for me is I try not and get attached to anyone. I do my best so they enjoy their ride with me but not dwell on what's going to happen to them. I do alot of dialysis so I see the same people each week. I know all their stories but I do my best to forget that they are all dying and each time I see them could be their last.   I do have my favorites though. Everyone has their favorite regulars.
ems,3dkozw,MrsKristyLynn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:24:47 2015 UTC,"This sounds fucked up to anyone who hasn't experienced it but you either drop out of the field early in your career or learn to stop caring.  I don't mean that you stop caring about your patients, but you learn to do it for the hour or so you are with them and then essentially forget about them.  In the beginning when you have only had a few patients each one of them is memorable and you will tend to think about them after the job is over the same as you would anyone else you become acquainted with.  But after a while they just kind of become faces in the crowd, a lot of jobs and patients you will forget completely by the following week.  The sad stories stop being actually sad, and as you are exposed to more fucked up jobs your standard for what you consider true pain and suffering climbs higher and higher.  After a while the guy with the broken ankle that you felt really bad for your first few months on the job becomes the annoying cry baby compared to the last three traumas you were on, and the nice old lady who has to go to dialysis has it made compared to the homeless alcoholic guy whose feet are rotting off.  Outside of EMS someone who thinks like that is a cold asshole, but if you are going to run thousands of calls in a career it's essential for preserving your mental health.  You never let your patients know that you plan on forgetting about them or that their suffering doesn't really bother you, and you treat them with every bit of care and compassion that they deserve from the people they depend on to help them when things go bad, but at the end of the day it just isn't possible to let yourself emotionally connect with people and still make it through a career without the baggage tearing you up.  You either stick it out long enough that you get used to it and get over it, or you let it get to you early and realize you're in the wrong place."

ems,3didcs,Meverseyou,6,Thu Jul 16 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"To me, this says ""Book Medicine"" should be revised which will follow up into ""Street Medicine"".  Street medicine exists separately because there's a lot of impracticality that goes into Book Medicine, which makes discounting it too easy.   Just look at the NREMT test for an example of that, the test is a joke, it's inconsistent across the board, ranging from impractical questions, to practical, to practical but unrealistically difficult, to impractical and ridiculously easy.   The version of the NREMT test I got was scarily easy, the fact that the person who even barely passes that could be my partner is terrifying.  Book teaching is too idealistic, it only teaches you how to be effective when everything works, your equipment is fine, your partner is capable, and your patient is coherent. When it's common for one of those things to be the opposite at any time.   It doesn't take actually working as an EMS provider to realize that either, when I was in school, during my ride along BP cuffs broke, we had very thick nitrile gloves that made it difficult or impossible to get a weak pulse, and that's just the beginning.  All before you even start working you realize the class isn't even teaching you half of what you really need to know."
ems,3didcs,Brandwins,4,Thu Jul 16 20:13:19 2015 UTC,"The responsible preceptor in me agrees with the article. We should be there to assist them in their journey from the classroom to practitioner. Promoting regular deviation from what they learned in class is not appropriate for a preceptor.   The crusty old medic in me however, agrees with you. The skill sheets sometimes make students focus on the wrong thing.  Obtaining a complete SAMPLE/OPQRST from a patient who is in respiratory failure is just pain dumb. (I don't give a shit about the last thing this person ate- if we don't act now, it will be the last thing this person ever eats.)"
ems,3didcs,m2inla,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:05 2015 UTC,"Great point. New Paramedics are making a journey from student to practitioner.

ems,3didcs,slamchop,3,Thu Jul 16 22:25:31 2015 UTC,"I feel that this is a huge problem in EMS and a reason why I don't have a lot of confidence in many of my peers despite being in the profession. It's the idea of using experience as the reason for a lack of diagnostic care. I've heard of many patients who received a shocking lack of an assessment because the provider believed they had seen it before (which then bit them in the ass). Those same people look at other providers (which in my view do the proper assessment for the situation) and use those type of providers for when the patient had nothing serious as justification for their habits. I could go into a whole discussion about this but the one of the big reasons I think this is so prevalent is because of the rapid development of medicine in EMS. I can personally vouch for a rapid change in scope and direction over the past 5 years in EMS in my area. What this rapid change does is create an inferiority complex for some that came before it. New students are coming out with more information and more skills which wasn't available when these providers first graduated. So these ""older"" providers have 2 choices to either continue to learn and study (constantly) or to not. And if they don't, I guarantee you even with con-ed they will begin to forget. And when they do, experience will be the thing that many will fall back on. And this doesn't exclude new students if they have the same tendencies as those that are being mentioned in a couple years they too will be in the exact same situation. I agree with the author of this article 100% regarding experience. I think it is invaluable and will make everyone a better provider however, that cannot be a providers only source of growth."
ems,3didcs,tridead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the article, I think a big problem with the street/book disconnect is that we're taught a bunch of things that aren't really medicine at all, with the understanding that we'll jump through the hoops to appease the state/NREMT testing requirements and then do it ""the street way"" when we get our cards.   ""All patients get high flow O2."" Everyone, even the most old school EMT instructor knows that not all patients get high flow oxygen in real life. Most state protocols very clearly state when high flow is appropriate. And yet, you better be putting it on all your patients when you do your practical testing, whether they have a broken leg or anaphylaxis. How can we blame people for creating a disconnect between street and book medicine when we actively tell people that it exists? How are new (or old) EMS providers supposed to differentiate between real medicine and stuff only important for testing?  And if the answer is ""do your own research"", yes you should, but then why don't we teach the correct technique in the first place??"

I still remember the paralyzed young lady living in a SNF whose family abandoned her, and she begged my partner and I to let her look at the Christmas tree in the lobby for a while and her smile as she looked at the community Christmas tree. Or the space engineer who talked and joked the whole time and was so pleased with our service that I didn't give 2 fucks that he was a bariatric pt and out lift assist dipped out.   I'll never forget the time after a crazy night transfer my partner and I sat on the roof of our truck and plowed through a half a pack of Camel Crushesafter going LnS through a few cities, or the multiple times I got stuck, broken down in the ghetto.   I'll never forget the man whose family left him after a terrible accident, and his decision to take his own life through non compliance of dialysis.

I noticed that his satellite box wasn't connected, so I fixed it for him. When I asked which channel he wanted, he replied, ""the one with the girls, although I doubt you'd know about it"" (I'm female).

ems,3dbv4o,ShaunaOfTheDead,9,Wed Jul 15 07:53:02 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm the author  Like most people who work in NJ EMS, I've bounced around quite a bit, and have several different jobs. I got started in EMS volunteering (in NJ most municipal EMS is still volunteer and the town level) in a medium sized suburban city (~2500 calls / year) when I was 17. We cover 3 major highways, and a fairly dense downtown area. I also volunteer at school, which is mostly ETOH/ drugs. I recently got hired as Per-Diem at a 911 Company which covers Urban/ Suburban areas, which means I'm going to scale back my other commitments and hopefully be working much less IFT.   My IFT is my ""day job"" since there's always hours if I want it. I work for a fairly large company which covers the entire state and runs ~25 BLS trucks on a typical day. We have contracts to cover ""emergencies"" for a lot of SNFs, which are with rare exceptions just unscheduled transports to the ER. Rarely we'll get flagged down for MVAs, or have a standard transport turn into emergencies. We also do standbys for large event / concerts around the state, and do overflow 911 for the municipalities our bases are located in. Recently we've picked up some actual municipal 911 contracts as volunteer agencies are folding across the state, which has caused some issues internally.  That's where most of my experience comes from. All of the stories in my post were from my days at IFT, but my ""good"" stories that non-EMS people like to hear (truama, MVA, hazmats, ETOH, etc) mostly come from 911 / volly. However I would say that I've had way more impactful experiences working IFT, but maybe that will change as I do more 911. Should also clarify, I was 19 when i took that specific patient which was a year ago, but as of writing this I'm 20. Hope I answered your question."

My 17 year old brother is doing a similar thing at the moment through a Junior EMT program run by my squad, and I work with a bunch of minor 3rds who are in various stages of getting their EMT card.

Since non-licensed squads aren't regulated (yet), you can roll a rig with the mailman and a pizza guy if you wanted too. Not saying it's best-practice though.   And expanding on the OP's question, when I was certified in NJ, I was 16 when I tested. Everyone else in the class got both an NREMT cert and a NJ Cert, and I just got an NJ card."

We are a national registry state, however depending on what state you live in, you can take a national registry assessment which basically means you pass the NR but you don't get certified. The state will certify you if you pass and that is enough to practice in your state. Then when you turn 18 you can pay $50 bucks and get your NR card.

Without even glancing at the patients. He goes up to the car driver to start exchanging insurance. Then a minivan masquerading as an ambulance pulls up and the driver casually walks the stretcher over to the dude with the broken leg and just rolls him on. The doctor gets out of the van and slowly mianders to the scene. Looks at both patients and he told the driver they had to take the entrapped one first.

Got 2 18s in her and started pumping fluids and morphine, and 3 minutes later mercy air came in and took her from us (transport would have been long). Last BP was 104/64.   Overall great call, just had to share because it was my first time ever treating a propeller accident and it was one of those calls where everything went smoothly and legitimately felt like I helped a lot as an AEMT with my medic."

Getting used to being 1-on-1 with a patient; practicing doing assessments and monitoring vital signs; practicing asking all your questions and writing reports: all vital skills for an EMT. Especially if you're planning on going to P school. I'm an ED tech and work with a tech who's never worked as an EMT outside the hospital. She's a great tech, she would have no idea what to do without nurses and doctors around to help. Experience being in the back of the rig with a patient all on your own is invaluable for an EMT."

ems,3dbvfd,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"It's not a provider problem, it's a system problem, as you stated.  My service is the only one in the province to be certified in NRP.  Given what we deal with, it's mind blowing that we can consider a ""back to basics review"" CME rather than actually learn new things and have interactions with patients, especially those we deal with on a semi-frequent basis."
ems,3dbvfd,Doc-Potson,2,Wed Jul 15 02:37:16 2015 UTC,"To not put some blame on providers is a little unfair.  When I worked full time in EMS I was the only medic with PALS for almost a year.  Even though the company paid for it none of the medics thought it was worth their time to find a program (my company would pay for, but did not teach PALS) and take a class on their day off.  Same with NRP.  To me those are minimum standards, so I took the time to get them as just a baseline knowledge.  Even though those classes have become less rigorous than they were back than it's far better than what's included in many paramedic programs."
ems,3dbvfd,justatouchcrazy,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:43 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's mind-blowing to me! It's unheard of around here for a service not to require PALS for medics. A service I used to work also required PEARS and pedi ITLS, for EMTs and medics.  That is lazy to not keep up your PALS or any other pediatric cert. Negligent, really. The same people who get bent out of shape on pedi calls, I'd bet. As mintygood said, getting emotional is a factor as well, and the general lack of pediatric call volume. But that's what makes continuing education so important in this area. You need to know how to treat a kid just as well as an adult. It's your job. Put aside your fears and do it."
ems,3dbvfd,Doc-Potson,2,Wed Jul 15 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  There is not reason to not have at the very least PALS on a 911 truck, and I personally think NRP should also be mandatory.    This was the same agency where I was in the tiny minority that had a trauma certification, and I was one of only 2 paramedics at the entire place with a degree, including the supervisors.  And I don't make any claims to being even close to the best prepared or brightest medic out there, but putting in just what should be the minimum shouldn't make me a top performer."
ems,3dbvfd,justatouchcrazy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:25:41 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's not even the bare bones. Insane that they don't require a trauma cert, I've never worked at an IFT that didn't require PHTLS or ITLS for medics, much less 911. Though degrees are also the exception, not the rule, here. Mine hasn't done much for me, though that may change in the future, so no regrets.  I'll have to look for a NRP course around. I don't have it myself, but it definitely sounds like it could be helpful."
ems,3dbvfd,Doc-Potson,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sadly that wan't necessarily unusual in the area at the time.  I've been out of EMS (at least full time) and moved away, so I hope it's improved, but I'm forever a pessimist and doubt it has.  I love NRP, and not just because I use to be an instructor.  You won't learn a lot necessarily, but it really cements what you already know and makes you more comfortable and systematic when doing a neonatal resuscitation.  Plus if you take it at a hospital most of the students will likely be L&D or NICU nurses and OB-GYNs or anesthesia providers, so there is the potential to learn a lot from the other students."
ems,3dbvfd,waydee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look into it, thanks. I'm actually off the truck at the moment, but it would definitely be beneficial once I'm back on the road or working in the ER again. Most calls, peds included, became second nature, but I've never done enough patient care with neonates for that to be. I have to recall, so some extra practice and education would do me well."
ems,3dbvfd,TrauMedic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"Gotta say I'm yet to work a paeds arrest but from what I've heard there's this willingness to throw our usual stay-and-play policy away just because its a child.  I'll have to dig deeper into specific cases but it definitely seems that people are generally okay with ceasing CPR if it's obviously not working for an adult (as per guidelines of course) but that doesn't happen with kids.  I'm guessing nobody is defaulting to rapid bolus diesel and shitty CPR en route though, or at least I hope not."
ems,3dbvfd,mintygood,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:05 2015 UTC,My protocols allow me to very clearly and easily determine death on scene for adults in a code.

If someone hasn't come back after 35 minutes they aren't going to.  But those that we actually work the way the evidence suggests we should? They have the best chance of survival.  Still a cool study (if small), and I think their finding about the resuscitation drugs would be cool to look further into as well."
ems,3dbvfd,dfein,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"In this observational study, a scene time of 10 to 35min was associated with the highest survival, especially among adolescents. Access for fluid resuscitation was associated with increased survival but advanced airway and resuscitation drugs were not.   Is it simply the degradation of compressions during rushed transport that causes the lower survival rates then? If intubation and resuscitation drugs aren't making a difference, could this be making case for Lucas devices or similar things rather than actually staying on scene longer."

At the time, I flushed it out with a little saline, and put it to the back of my mind through the rest of the call. At the ER, I washed it out with soap and water. The puncture hadn't bled much, and didn't seem that deep. Then I made the dreaded call to the shift captain.  I had blood drawn that morning to test for HBV, HCV, and HIV. They all came back negative. I was told that it can take weeks or even months to get a positive result if I was infected, so I'd have to be tested again in six weeks, and again at six months after the incident. When I repeated the process six weeks later, HBV and HIV were still negative, but my blood was positive for HCV antibodies. I got a PCR test after that, which confirmed detectable HCV RNA.  I got referred to a gastroenterologist, who recommended interferon to try to prevent chronic infection. After six months of interferon injections three times a week, the PCR tests were unfortunately still showing a detectable viral load.  Thankfully, aside from one episode during the interferon treatment, my ALT and AST levels have been within normal limits, I haven't had any jaundice or severe symptoms, and I still have no liver fibrosis.

Had been sick for two to three weeks. Her bed was literally covered in body fluids, there was nothing we could do but get dirty. Stabilized and got the BP up but she passed away in the ICU the next day.   Three days later we get a call (partner and I) form AMR that the hospital contacted them and let them know it was a confirmed H1N1 case.  I got sick a few days after that. It was THE Fing sickest I've ever been. I was literally too weak to get out of bed. It was horrible.  Nothing really came of it, I got passed it and didn't need any hospital care or anything, but it was like the regular flu times a thousand.  The big takeaway that I had is you really don't know. We judge and take precautions as we run calls. But you can't do that, by the time you know you need some kind of PPE it's too late. She was just sick, just like every other PT, H1N1 is more virulent than regular flue (r0 of ~1.5) and transmissibility is therefore substantially higher than that of seasonal flu. It's comparable with lower estimates of R0 obtained from previous influenza pandemics. But it looked just like any other sickness. If she had the flu I would have been fine.  Now, I wear clear glasses on every call, have a mask at least around my neck on almost any infections disease, and in general take precautions much more seriously.

An unstable pelvic fracture is caused by a break in two or more places on a pelvic ring. Splinting the pelvis by providing compression is helpful to reduce sheer and compress bleeding vessels, reducing hemorrhage.  A hip fracture involves the femur. Most commonly the ""neck"" of the femur. The mechanism for a majority of these fractures are simple falls in the elderly.  Treatment should be directed at reducing pain. Hip fractures are absolutely an indication for calling ALS for pain management. I typically place a soft pillow under the patient's knee, this seems to help some, but opiates help the most.   Placing a compression device over the fractured femur causes more pain and could dislocate the fractured neck medially, causing more harm."

The term ""hip fracture"" is commonly used to refer to four different fracture patterns and is often due to osteoporosis; in the vast majority of cases, a hip fracture is a fragility fracture due to a fall or minor trauma in someone with weakened osteoporotic bone. Most hip fractures in people with normal bone are the result of high-energy trauma such as car accidents, falling from heights, or sports injuries.

ems,3dajml,_T_J_L_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:22:46 2015 UTC,I have always done it and seen it taught as wrapping the folded sheet around the pt and then rolling the edges of the sheet together tightly all around their hips/tighs/lower stomach and duct taping it. I feel like it is probably easier to get it tighter this way and there's less movement in their legs.  Does it work this way with tying a knot too?
ems,3dajml,Hams42,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:18 2015 UTC,"Sheet splint, no split"
ems,3dajml,Bones_MD,3,Wed Jul 15 03:52:10 2015 UTC,Its the one thing a KED is useful for if you can get it under the patient. If not I use a sheet and get it nice and tight. We have new splints that look like a weightlifters belt to use but I haven't run a hip injury since we got them on the units.
ems,3dajml,JaySin777,2,Wed Jul 15 03:25:19 2015 UTC,"Just came from this very call earlier today. Just remember that every patient is different. The actual trauma caused, the pain tolerance, environment etc.  In most cases, I prefer the sheet wrap/splint around the hip area prior to movement. This keeps the motion to a minimum and adds support for relief. Then lift with a scoop stretcher. If there leg is angulation, keep in the found position which is most likely the most comfortable for that patient. Pad to comfort and make sure your driver takes it easy around corners. Bumps can't be helped, but taking a turn too fast can be. Always advocate for your patient."
ems,3dajml,zombieron,2,Tue Jul 14 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Sheet splint, scoop stretcher.  Definitely try to get analgesia onboard, though."
ems,3dajml,Kibaken,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:38 2015 UTC,"I tend to use a couple of frac-straps to bind the thighs together to minimise movement during the lift.  I've seen people use a t-pod down there too (i.e not at the pelvis) but seems like an expensive waste of kit when frac-straps are available.  edit: on reading below I'm perhaps going wrong with the frac-straps, I'll have to read more into this.  Scoop stretcher if there's the room for it but otherwise the only choice is often chair which is less than ideal but short of the ideal scenario of getting the trolley very close to the patient who's fallen and broken their hip in a nice open area it's often the only option.  Strapping the leg to the uninjured one goes some way to making this better for the patient, typically they'll get morphine or entonox before we start moving though.  If you haven't got analgesia available to you I'd say it'd be a bit cruel to try moving the average hip fx pt without it.  IV paracetamol if available, they're dragging their heels on this one where I work for some reason.  Minimal movement of the affected leg of course, supporting it as much as possible.  If it's the typical tiny old lady then blankets either side of the patient in the trolly to minimise movement and one under the knee if necessary.  Aside from that it's just your average fracture, check your distal pulse, manage pain and specific to hips confirm any shortening and/or rotation."
ems,3dajml,waydee,4,Tue Jul 14 21:59:44 2015 UTC,Your not wrong with frac straps. Many Americans here are thinking hip=pelvic where as in the UK its two distinct presentations.
ems,3dajml,cyber_andyy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:59:47 2015 UTC,"KED works well if you can slide it under and tighten to comfort level. Slide the KED with a sheet underneath it under the patient as carefully as possible and then lift as one, having someone control/lift the hips secured with the KED if possible. Hip fractures are the only thing I've ever used a KED for and it works well to stabilize the pelvis and prevent unnecessary pain/movement. I've also lifted just with a sheet -- it just depends on the severity of the pain/injury and the patient's positioning/environment.  as a paramedic I try to provide narcotic analgesia if I think it's going to cause the patient a lot of pain to move -- which most hip fractures do."
ems,3dajml,NCEMTP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:09:09 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer sheet splint and a scoop stretcher.   The medic I work with almost always uses a reeves and a scoop and a lot of fentanyl and it works pretty good.

ems,3db0e5,MikeZ80,6,Tue Jul 14 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"Palpate the brachial pulse. If you can't feel it, have them straighten out their elbow all the way, thus making the brachial arterie more anterior (protip: have them rest their elbow on your knee with their palm up, letting gravity do the work of straightening their arm all the way).  If you still can't feel it (and it isn't an emergent situation), then take your time palpating different locations in the AC until you do feel the brachial pulse. Place bell of steth over pulse and go to town.  If it IS an emergent situation and you can't auscultate a bp first try, skip straight to palpating a bp at the radial.  Edit: elbow on knee really only works if they're on the gurney in the ambulance and you're sitting on the bench seat beside them. If they're on the ground or in bed or something, have them rest their arm flat out on the ground, palm up, along their side."
ems,3db0e5,MacAndTheBoys,2,Tue Jul 14 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Don't ever palpate a blood pressure clinically. Palpated blood pressures have an accuracy of +/- 30mmHg. This means that if you say ""90/p"" it could be 60 or it could be 120. Absolutely meaningless.  Palpated blood pressures are not clinical tools. I hate to say it, but it's one of the quickest ways that I know I need to take other responders information wit ha grain of salt. It's one thing for a completely healthy BLS PT, but on any other call it's much more clinically significant to say you can't get a Bp. There is nothing wrong with that at all. Sometimes peoplse anatomy make it tough in the field.  Document UTO and why if there is a reason and then document other indications of perfusion status.

ems,3db0e5,NCEMTP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"I have 3 littmanns and an ultrascope and the ultrascope works the best for me. The big head also forces me to put the cuff higher up on the arm, which reduces any rubbing/background noises.   If you are in the back of the ambulance moving, pick up your heels so only your toes are touching the ground. This reduces the vibrations/road noise traveling up your leg bones. Might be placebo, but I've been doing that for years."

ems,3db0e5,placenta_jerky,3,Thu Jul 16 02:30:19 2015 UTC,"Practice. Seriously, auscultations a bp is something that everyone pretends is easy, but it really does take a lot of practice to develop the skill (especially in a moving ambulance, but even in a quiet environment). I also find that palpating a radial pulse while auscultating helps improve confidence that what you heard is in fact the pulse restoring. Get your partner to let you practice on them, or if you don't like your partner, then your family, friends, etc."
ems,3db0e5,medic26,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:02:25 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter at all.  Focus on your studies. Don't lose sleep over the fact that you can't auscultate a human gourd.
ems,3db0e5,kelvin_klein_bottle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"Don't stress it too much.  BP is a puzzle piece that sometimes doesn't give a whole lot of insight as to what's happening.  Yes it's important but don't loose sleep over it.  Honestly I think that pulserate, EKG reading, SpO2, and cap refil are more useful diagnostic tools prehospital.    Yes hypotension is a bitch but you're going to loose your cap refill and be tachycardic which is obvious.   Yes hypertension is a bitch but, outside of headinjury, stroke, and hypertensive crisis it is rarely a huge prehospital issue.  Even if it were the previous conditions that I mentioned there would be other signs that would point you where you need to go.  TL;DR: Don't stress, keep on trying and you're fine"
ems,3db0e5,mintygood,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:17:48 2015 UTC,"Place your fingers across the crook of the elbow, palpate the brachial.

They normally treat the nursing staff no better and end up alienated by staff and EMS.  As for the sedation order, document the shit out of it on the pcr and report him. Denying orders to you is one thing, hanging up on a crew is dangerous to you and the patient.   If you honestly feel he acts this way to your crews on purpose, you all need to start documenting the events and mass reporting them to the hospital until he changes his attitude towards you or leaves the EC.

People that dropped out either weren't doing any work, had personal problems or missed a mandatory day, otherwise it's been a great class.  It's reasonably priced too.

ems,3d8ohs,edragon20,2,Tue Jul 14 18:36:03 2015 UTC,How does one determine what size ETtube to use on a pt?  I.e what pt would need a 6.0 vs a 7.0 size tube?
ems,3d8ohs,WC_Dirk_Gently,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"what pt would need a 6.0 vs a 7.0 size tube?   A patient that I don't think I can get a 7 into first try.  It really is that simple. You can just look at a patients face/neck/throat externally and make some inferences of what the internal anatomy is going to be like and plan accordingly. Or for trauma, or especially airway edema I'm immediately reaching for smaller ET's.  TL;DR: You can get adequate tidal volume for pretty much any adult lung volumes through a 6.0 or even a 5.0 with no real problem. Peak and mid-inspiratory flows in humans are approximately 0.5 L/kg/min. And resistance doesn't really start exponentially increasing until 4.5, and really not until 3.5 do you really start getting crazy exponential resistance gains.  However: The really important thing to remember when settling on a smaller ID tube is that they're generally shorter. And if you're putting a 5.0 into Gregor Clegane it may not be long enough. And the cuff may be on the loose side.  It may be less than ideal, and if your bringing in your patient to a Trauma 1 where an anesthesiologist will probably be present and taking report from you about the airway, you may catch a little attitude if you put a 5.0 into Gregor Clegane. But I'd say if your patient needs to be tubed, having a 6.0, or even a 5.0 that is done and working is infinitely more useful than a 7.0 you're on a second or third attempt with.  Things you would need to consider though are for any sort of primary respiratory complaint where you expect them to need suctioning, using a small tube will make that a major pain in the ass. Also if you get a small tube, it may mean the patient has to be extubated and re-intubated in the hospital, which creates a risk. Even if for no other reason than fulfilling a meaningless checkbox on the paperwork.   Lastly, Don't forget the bougie. Can turn a what would other-wise be a 5.0 into a 7.5 with ease."

Remember, our job (especially as EMTs) is not big, bad, badass lifesavers; we are there to ease suffering in every way we can.

ems,3d7px5,unittwelve,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:26:03 2015 UTC,Our medical director completely removed activated charcoal from our protocols. Not even the ALS ambulance carry it in my county.  How often do you use the hemostatic dressings?
