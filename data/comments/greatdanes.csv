greatdanes,3e55jb,TyrionHalfDwarf,3,Wed Jul 22 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"Look up BARF coops online.  You will want to feed 2 to 3% of ideal weight daily... This should be roughly between 4 and 5 lbs a day.  You're going to pay at least $1 / lb... You need find the right mix of organ meat, green tripe, bones, and meat for your dogs.    Another option is to get very friendly with local butchers and collect their scrap... You will want to be very careful if you do this so as not to feed too much fat.  There are a gazzillion things to know and learn... A BARF coop will eliminate the need to learn about 1/2 the things (like recipes and mixes and what is OK to feed)."
greatdanes,3e55jb,scottley,2,Wed Jul 22 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"We have been feeding our dogs raw for 7 years.  There aren't any recipes per say.  You just want to make sure they are getting the right percentage of meat, tripe, organ meat and bone.  We feed ours a variety of beef, venison, elk, wild boar, goat and chicken.  We get our food from a Co-Op on Yahoo groups (Rocky Mountain Raw Feeders).  We spend $80 a month to feed our 45lb Border Collie mix and our 75lb Golden.  We are expecting our food bill to double with our new Dane at home once he's fully grown, so $160 total.  There are some great perks to going raw for the dogs and you.  They absorb so much more of their food which means smaller poops!  They typically don't need to be bathed as often.  It has been 2 years since our Border Collie mix got a bath and you'd never know.  Our Golden rolls in everything and he gets a bath every 6-9 months.  The dogs don't produce as much ear wax.  They are far healthier than kibble fed dogs.  Our Golden's allergies went away completely within 3 months of switching to raw.  Most raw fed dogs have less gas.  The downsides of raw are the amount of space it takes up.  We have 2 freezers that are stuffed (3-4 months of food).  It takes more time to feed the dogs.  My wife preps all the bags each Sunday for the next week.  The smell can put a lot of people off, particularly the tripe.  There was a great article in ""Dogs Naturally"" about a guy who grew up with raw fed Great Danes in Scandinavia and his Danes averaged 14 years old. We are crossing our fingers with our little guy.  Right now we are feeding our Dane pup 8-10% of his body weight each day (2-2.5lbs).  We will continue to do that until it is the same as 2-3% of his ideal fully grown weight (3.5-5lbs assuming he is a very big boy at 175lbs).  If you want further info let me know.  It can be a bit daunting at first, but it gets very easy as you get into it and get your percentages of all the different meats and bone."

I bought a tub of the treats from Amazon. They're a little pricey but that tub will last forever, especially because you can (and should) break the cubes into smaller pieces for training. Stewart Freeze Dried Liver Treats"
greatdanes,3dyax7,Embeast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:15 2015 UTC,"You can take a couple of different approaches- just general treats, and ""high interest"" treats.  For just general training & rewards, I'd head to the petstore and pick up a bag of any treat that fits what you want to give your dog (soft, crunchy, grain-free, whatever.) Preferably get a back with lots of pieces, or larger treats that can easily be broken down. Grabbing a bag of something like this can be a really good starting point- they're small, there's a ton of them in the bag, and they're cheap! If your puppy ends up not liking them, you're not at a huge loss. I would use something like this for just general training.  If your puppy is being exceptionally stubborn about something, or if you're working on a more difficult task, you can use a high reward/interest treat- something that your puppy is really crazy about, but doesn't get very often. When we were in training classes they used chunks of cooked chicken as an example. The thought process is that like a person, the puppy will work harder and pay better attention to a difficult task when there is a greater reward at stake.  We never really had a problem with our girl being picky about treats, but if that's something you're concerned about, I would pick up a small variety of treats (in the small bag sizes!) so you can experiment and see what really catches your puppy's attention :)"
greatdanes,3dyax7,murryblue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"We use ground beef. It's cheaper in large quantities than a lot of training treats, and it's easy on his sensitive stomach.

greatdanes,3du9uc,Melflorez,4,Sun Jul 19 15:15:28 2015 UTC,"Hi! Researching dog food is a pretty frustrating experience, and it's worse for Danes because there's a lot of, er, differing viewpoints I guess I'd say. When I got my guy many years ago he had extremely loose stools, so I decided to drop the breeder's recommended diet and spent a few months researching other options. We tried Chicken Soup, the specs look good but I had an unexpected problem - none of my three dogs liked it! They just wouldn't eat it. I eventually settled on Eukanuba Large Breed, which firmed up his stools, and seems to do real well for him. He's nine years old and acts like he's three. Never had any health problems."
greatdanes,3du9uc,joeomar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the advice! I'll look more into Eukanuba. You're right, it is definitely frustrating trying to figure out what to feed them as everyone seems to have different suggestions. On a side note, what a handsome pup you have there! Do you have any more advice for me simply on what to expect and how to get the best experience possible out of our new family member?"
greatdanes,3du9uc,joeomar,4,Sun Jul 19 16:18:27 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... socializing him is important, taking him places where he meets lots of people and other dogs. I've seen recommendations to not have Dane puppies jump from high places or run too hard from fear it may cause microfractures that in later life could lead to bone cancer. Good luck with that - it's a puppy!  Otherwise, I've had two other dogs and the Dane's puppy behavior wasn't really any different. Which means it's a lot of work.  Harlan ate like a pig as a puppy, he gained 5 lbs per week for a while. As an adult he's not a particularly avid eater; he doesn't gobble his meal (sometimes ignores it when I put it down) and is pretty choosy about treats, he doesn't like dry dog biscuits at all. I guess I don't know how normal that is for a Dane.  One thing I regret is not having had a gastropexy done on him. This is an operation to prevent bloat (gastric dilatation and volvulus, or GDV) which is very life threatening. Great Danes are the breed most susceptible to it. Many owners I know have a gastropexy done at the same time the dog is spayed or neutered. I asked my vet at the time, but he was old-school and recommended against it. I wish I'd overridden him. Harlan is 9 years old and never had a problem, but I believe susceptibility grows with age.  Speaking of which, if you can find other Dane owners in your area try and get a good recommendation for a vet who knows Great Danes. My first vet didn't. Harlan was an adult when I had him neutered. The morning I dropped him off they told me they would keep him overnight (standard procedure), but that afternoon when I called to check on him they asked me to come get him. Turns out they didn't have a kennel big enough and had just laid him on the bathroom floor to recuperate. I'm like, why did you tell me this morning you were keeping him overnight? Did you not notice he's too big for your kennels until after surgery? It's dangerous to put a big dog on the floor after surgery, their body temperature's harder to manage and a big drop in temp can be fatal after surgery.  As to what to expect:  My Dane rarely counter-surfs. However, when I'm preparing dinner (cutting up a chicken or whatever) he will rest his chin on the counter and watch, which is a little disconcerting. I always wash and put away butcher knives after using, for fear he may think it smells good and grab it. Even if they don't snatch things off the counter, they have awareness of what's happening at counter-height. Once I put a stick of butter in the center of my very large kitchen island, where he couldn't reach it. No problem, he just squatted down slightly, jumped up onto the island, walked over and got it.  Danes of course get attention in public. When you're walking him it'll be stop and go, you'll spend lots of time talking to people. Anyway my point is, once we were walking in a park and an elderly couple were coming up some hillside stairs. Harlan distracted them so much the woman tripped and fell on the stairs! And her husband, who was in front of her, didn't notice! So now I tend to avoid walking him along busy streets from fear a distracted driver might have an accident. I know, that sounds weird but I felt really bad about that elderly lady.  Personality wise, Great Danes do not think they are a lapdog, they simply are a lapdog, with some ergonomic issues. They love to get physical with their human. When I sit on a couch to watch TV, Harlan jumps up beside me and flops his upper body across my lap. If I'm in the recliner he tries to figure out a way to crawl in on top of me. Right now as I'm typing he pushed his head under my arms to rest it in my lap. He sleeps in bed with me, and lies against me all night long often with his head on top of my chest or at least somewhere in contact.   Fortunately Harlan doesn't jump on visitors (well, rarely). He's fairly tentative when meeting someone new, but often will decide immediately that he likes them. When he accepts someone he will stand in front of them and lean sideways against them; this is the Great Dane ""lean"", and I'm in the habit of shouting out ""brace yourself"" when it's imminent. Otherwise Harlan's weight pushes the person backward, which doesn't bother Harl, he simply steps sideways to make up the lost space and then leans on them again. I've seen people moved three or four feet before finally digging in.  And Danes get extremely devoted to their human (which is why it's very sad for them if they need to be re-homed). After 9 years Harlan still follows me around, or when we're outside (we live on an acreage) and he's running around he always keeps looking back at me to maintain awareness of where I am. I once went out of town for about 10 days and had a housesitter; the housesitter told me Harlan spent much of the time lying in the hallway outside the door to the garage, waiting for me to come through it. His loyalty and devotion is incredible, it's so extreme it's practically a superpower.  You will be the absolute center of his existence. It's a bit intimidating. But it may be why every Dane owner I know has said they will never be without one.  Sorry I'm rambling... Just things that came to mind..."

My first one was a rescue and we never crated, and I got him at about 6 months and he was easily able to sleep all the way through the night on his dog bed in our room. My younger Dane we got as a pup. As we were working through crate training I would say around the 14-15 week mark I tried getting him to go through the night. The funny thing was, he just didn't want to be in his crate. So we just brought the crate into our bedroom, left the door open and boom - he slept all the way through the night, happy as a clam. Danes are notorious for wanting to be close to their owners. I would say that once they are only getting let out 1x per night, you can try transitioning their crate to your sleeping area and see if that helps. I hope this was helpful!"

greatdanes,3cyifg,cuntycucumber,2,Sun Jul 12 20:26:10 2015 UTC,Good luck Eva!! You can do this :D May I ask what symptoms lead you to discovering the cancer in her leg?
greatdanes,3cyifg,Aryada,2,Sun Jul 12 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"I noticed her leg was a little larger above her ankle joint on her right leg a couple of weeks ago.  It looked swollen but upon touching it, it felt hard and bone like. We found out at her first vet appointment, with xrays, that there is an osteosarcoma tumor in her bone.  Her body started causing some calcification around that particular area that contributed to the swollen look of her ankle."

greatdanes,3cufym,dave42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"When Wallace is hungry, very little chewing occurs. If he is feeling peckish, he will deliberately take one piece at a time and chew it.    But, as a puppy he inhaled his kibble!   As long as he wasn't choking I didn't worry, but we did spread his kibble out on a tray to slow him down.    You want to encourage him to eat more slowly so he doesn't ingest too much air (a cause of bloat).  Wallace has slowed down as he has gotten older and learned no other puppies were coming to eat it all!"

Our Golden had similar issues with kibble and my wife switched the dogs to raw and everything was cleared up pretty quick.  Raw feeding isn't that difficult to get into.  My guess your pup would love it.  We immediately put our dane on it the first day he was home and has had zero issues and goes nuts over it.  What did your vet say about what is going on?
greatdanes,3ct64i,xacmitch19,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"By raw diet you mean feeding them just raw meet instead of any pre-made dog foods? Do you ever use the rolls of raw dog meat, meaning like the rolls of food that look like a Jimmy dean sausage roll? Our vets have just told us about feeding them adult foods and have made a couple of suggestions on what foods to try but not much after that. She is gradually doing better on the different foods,  but we would rather have her passing solid bowel movements. >All our dogs are on a raw diet.

greatdanes,3ct64i,xacmitch19,2,Fri Jul 10 17:55:17 2015 UTC,"Raw meat they come in rolls/chubs of 1-2lbs each.  Our dogs get venison, beef, elk, wild boar, green tripe, organ meat tripe, goat and chicken.  Some of those will have ground up bone in them.  We jokingly say that our dogs eat better than most people do!  We get all of our stuff from Texas Tripe Company.  My wife is part of Rocky Mountain Raw Feeders on Yahoo groups.  There are a lot of companies that supply raw dog food.  We spend about $80 a month to feed raw with our two older dogs.  We expect to be at $160 a month with our Great Dane in the mix."
greatdanes,3ct64i,xacmitch19,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"I gotcha, I'm not sure if you do any hunting but have you fed them any wild game that you have killed yourself or do you just order it all? I'm not sure if they treat it specially or if they can eat any type of wild game"
greatdanes,3ct64i,BullTerrierMom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"I did hunt, but I haven't for quite a few years now.  So we just order everything.  I wouldn't see why they couldn't eat wild game.  It's all about giving them a balanced diet, the right combo of organ meat, bone, tripe and regular meat.  Fully grown dogs eat 2-3% of their ideal body weight in a raw diet each day."
greatdanes,3ct64i,murryblue,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"You can ask if you know hunters for the organs that they usually throw away. Very nutritive, just freeze it a 3-4 weeks before feeding it."
greatdanes,3ct64i,murryblue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"I see that your vet has recommended that you feed her adult food- have you been back to see your vet since the problems have worsened/continued?   People in this sub have some wonderful food recommendations (and some have experience with problems like this) but if your puppy is constantly leaking feces as you described it, I would 100% recommend getting some second opinions from vets and possibly getting her tested for food allergies if you haven't already. I don't mean to imply that you aren't giving your dog the proper care or anything! It's just that based on your descriptions this sounds pretty serious, and if your current vet isn't really giving you any assistance/advice (and it's hard to tell since you haven't really mentioned much about their involvement) I would seriously go get a second opinion from another vet.  iirc feeding them foods with a higher protein % can cause softer poops, and while it sounds like this goes beyond that, it might be good to keep in mind and bring up with a vet. Good luck!"
greatdanes,3ct64i,BullTerrierMom,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"We have been back and have been in contact with them and they have mostly just been giving us recommendations for which foods are best. She isn't constantly leaking feces,  I may have described it in a misleading way,  it's more like she will very solemnly have a diarrhea attack. It's happened twice now on two different foods.  Like I said our vet has given us recommendations but never has seemed overly concerned with her feces being soft or runny. The blood they were very worried about, but the soft stool they aren't."
greatdanes,3ct64i,quincess,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to hear that it's not quite as severe as I thought, then, and that your vet has been communicating with you! I would still look into getting some tests done to see if she has a food allergy if it continues- I've seen other redditers post in the past about how that was the culprit of the overly runny poops!"

greatdanes,3cqr67,Krackeness,4,Fri Jul 10 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"Old danes becoming incontinent is not uncommon.   It's not a behavioral problem, it's a medical issue.  If your dog is having solid poops, but is having accidents, you just may need to spend more time outside before letting him back in.  You probably know his bowel movement schedule as well as he does...  If you go outside and he doesn't poop, but it is time to go, hang out for a munute or two.  Good luck!"

greatdanes,3ckx5i,DecoyDrone,2,Wed Jul 8 18:36:31 2015 UTC,Could you sit him in the back seat?
greatdanes,3ckx5i,dabisnit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:13:00 2015 UTC,He gets too stressed out there because it just isn't big enough for him. In the cargo area he just lays down and is a much happier dog when he jumps out than if he has rear seat access.
greatdanes,3ckx5i,scottley,2,Wed Jul 8 20:15:31 2015 UTC,"I have a mini clubman... Seats fold down, two danes lay in the back.  If i have my wife and daughter with me, there's still enough room for us all."
greatdanes,3ckx5i,scottley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:45:31 2015 UTC,What do you do for safety though?
greatdanes,3ckx5i,silverphobos,2,Thu Jul 9 01:46:41 2015 UTC,They lay in the back and I drive a little slower than normal.
greatdanes,3ckx5i,silverphobos,2,Thu Jul 9 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"OP - We own a Toyota 4Runner. Similar to your outback, our Dane is nice and comfortable in the cargo area. We put down a memory foam bed that fits perfectly in the cargo area and our girl really loves it there. Our windows are also tinted and we crack the rear window for air circulation but otherwise we haven't taken any additional safety measures. When we first got our girl, I had given this exact question some serious thought and I'm still considering options. For now though, I'm not just concerned about her if we crash but also my family and me. If we crash, she's likely to fly around in the truck. She's the size of a small adult. That's a lot of weight to be flying around without some barrier or seatbelt harness and I'm worried that she could hurt us (and her) in the event of an accident. I had considered a wire mesh car barrier or something similar to help compensate this but haven't pulled the trigger on that idea yet. Hope you get the answers you're looking for. Keep us posted on what works as I and other Dane owners may need to consider similar safety options. :)"
greatdanes,3ckx5i,rockpimpcess,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"So far in my own research I have found this harness. I think I may try it out but I am not sure what it would do exactly in a crash? Would it save him, or just save us from him? I honestly hope I never have to test it's abilities but from personal non dog related experience I know optional safety does pay off.  Subaru apparently makes a very sturdy divider, but it seems that is more for dogs that wander around the car than crash safety. Maybe in a crash it would make the cargo area more like a crate (contained area), which is a pretty safe place for them to be? Reviews on it say it reduces the size of the cargo area, which may not be ideal. My Dane doesn't even try to wander, he just gets comfy and sometimes slobbers up the rear seat heads. Otherwise he is just snoring it up in the back.  Lets hope that someone else in this subreddit has some experience with this stuff and comments over the next few days. Otherwise I may just grab the harness and make my own review of it for here."
greatdanes,3ckx5i,rockpimpcess,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"That harness looks like it could do the trick. Thanks for sharing the link. I may actually pick this up myself. I live in western Washington where a lot of drivers like to slam on the breaks suddenly, causing me to do the same. Luckily I haven't had our dane with us when it's happened but, I know she would have been thrown forward, even from a resting position. If you decide to get it, let us know what you think about it."
greatdanes,3ckx5i,rockpimpcess,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:28:50 2015 UTC,We usually put the seats down for our dog and she lays on top with the ac. Do the seats go down in an outback?
greatdanes,3ckx5i,ElCaballoGigante,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yes they go down, but I don't think it would be great for him to have that much room. He gets stressed out from being moved around. I think he likes having something sturdy to get his back against like when he is in the cargo area and the seats are up. Makes all of this tricky."
greatdanes,3ckx5i,ArtofStu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well the only other suggestion I can come up with would be a cool bed. They come in all sizes. Basically you would fill it with cold water and it would give him a place to lay that would be cooler than just the cargo bed. Maybe combine that with those infant sun shades in the back windows?  That wouldn't do much for safety unfortunately.  I haven't seen any kind of safety harness for a cargo area."
greatdanes,3ck6qc,thr33beggars,2,Wed Jul 8 15:31:40 2015 UTC,My wife and i will just sterilize our little boy without taking anything out.  We have read about a lot of issues regarding danes having their parts removed due to the lack of hormones.  We likely won't do that until at least 18 months.
greatdanes,3ck6qc,xacmitch19,2,Wed Jul 8 16:10:49 2015 UTC,My dane was spayed without issue at 9 months. She is nine now!
greatdanes,3ck6qc,tuffyt,2,Wed Jul 8 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"I neutered my male at about 20 months, after I decided for sure not to breed him. No problems, he's nine years old.  Another thought - while the dog is under anesthesia, many people will also have a gastropexy performed on the GD. Grastropexy prevents gastric torsion (""bloat"") which is a leading cause of death in Great Danes."

greatdanes,3ck6qc,scottley,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"If you've found a good vet, you should be fine. Actually, if you've gone through a breeder, ask who their vet is! When we got our girl, our breeder offered (as she offers all her new pup-parents) for us to use her vet for her spay and gastropexy. Our breeder offers to board the dog for a week so she can keep an eye on them post-surgery and make sure everything's alright, and that they're eating well. A vet that's dealt with Great Danes before won't have any issue.  Also, have you considered getting the gastropexy? If you are, get it all done at once. No need for two surgeries if you can get it all done in one go. My girl was done at 13 month (would have been at one year, but she went into heat days before her scheduled surgery.. oh well!)"
greatdanes,3ckak4,krazikanaidian,3,Wed Jul 8 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, mine usually only acts like that if it's raining outside. Do you live somewhere cold? I would just try using more force on the leash, but stop short of simply dragging him, then releasing pressure and praising him as soon as he starts moving on his own. You have to show him that he's going outside whether he likes it or not, but make it clear how happy you are with him once he's out there."
greatdanes,3ckak4,tylerthehun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"oddly enough, he seems ok in the rain. Its been super hot/humid though. we have AC. that might be part of it too."
greatdanes,3ckak4,vinny-is-a-cat,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"mine totally has this stubborn streak. while he's very young and NEEDS to go outside every couple of hours you could keep just carrying him in that late evening potty break. as he grows bigger he will also grow endurance and eventually won't need to go out at midnight. mine currently goes (normally) at 7 am, 4pm, and 10pm and that's it. as far as dealing with the stubborn behavior directly, mine is not super food motivated (the stubborn runs deep) but he loves LOVES dried beef liver. it comes in little squares and is super stinky. use that for coaxing purposes and make sure he can smell it as you go. little puppies and danes in particular are known for planting their butts when very young on leash, so just keep trying and it will get better."

greatdanes,3ckak4,janecollective,2,Thu Jul 9 00:31:37 2015 UTC,"What are you trying to get him to do? Just pee? He is very little so he bladder is really predictable and he is really sleepy when he is sleepy.  If he is drinking water he will need to go in probably 5-20 minute. I am assuming he isn't drinking water if he is asleep....so take him out after he has his last food and water and let him go to the bathroom, them crate him for the night. He isn't taking in any more food or water, so he should be okay, and he should be in a crate to prevent him from wanting to go to the bathroom in his bed.  If he is in asleep-for-the-night mode then waking him up will be hard and he should have had his last food and water quite a bit ago, so you shouldn't need to be taking him out additionally.  tldr: You puppy is little and is predictable and can't hold it, so he should be on a schedule. Take him out shortly after his last food and water and he should be good for the night. He shouldn't be eating and drinking before bed, in such as a way as to make him need to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night."

greatdanes,3ccyh9,xacmitch19,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:05:47 2015 UTC,"Something that isn't classical discipline that has worked for some of my dogs is yelping.  As soon as you feel teeth, yelp loudly.  Your pup doesn't want to hurt you and this typically should yield an ""I'm sorry"" response.  If the pup responds by licking your chin, you've made your point.  That said, the pup needs to chew... Get bones or whatever chew toys work.    Don't ever play with the pup with a toy in your hand.  It makes it hard for the pup to know where you stop and the toy ends.  Throwing toys is ok."

greatdanes,3catng,mr_brendo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:35:24 2015 UTC,"We were super diligent about housebreaking and got our 8-week old pretty sorted out in 2 weeks - with very few indoor accidents, but this did include middle of the night wake-ups and groggy sessions standing outside in dark to get him to pee..  We had one crate 'accident' but that was because I got caught up at work and got home 25 minutes later than i knew i should. We still have his Midwest Ginormous crate. We used a divider panel after he outgrew his starter crate.  Now he's got the whole thing and he still goes in it when he wants to be undisturbed to sleep, which is a lot of the time.  It has become a permanent fixture in my living room but I put a black sheet over it so it's as unobtrusive as possible.  We used treat training from the get-go and were pretty strict about training - puppy class, Good Canine Citizen training, etc.  He's going to get big, so the more well behaved you can get him, the happier everyone will be (including him).  Good luck, it's one of the most fun adventures.  Take a lot of pictures, he'll grow so fast you won't believe it."
greatdanes,3catng,TrashyRonin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:48:36 2015 UTC,About 2 weeks..We only crated our boys after crate training if they were destructive when we were away and only one of our boys was like that. That one grew out of it and the crate was no longer needed and we just let them run free in house which usually entailed just laying on couch..lol
greatdanes,3catng,brobradh77,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"We also have that giant Midwest crate, and continue to use it- it was super great for potty/crate training, but we crate trained our dog with the intent that it be a long-term practice, so to speak. Essentially, we kennel our dog at night and when we're out of the house- even though she's potty trained, she's still young, inquisitive, and energetic at a year old, and we live in an upstairs apartment. It's a courtesy to our neighbors and provides an extra level of peace of mind for me that she's not going to do something completely insane while I'm gone, even if she's generally very well behaved.  Plus I can sleep in my own bed unhindered, unless I decide I want a furry guest!  We're lucky enough that we have a spare/guest bedroom that we can keep the crate in; in our last home we had it in the living room because it was the only place it fit, and like someone else mentioned, we would just drape a sheet over the top, or do something like place a large board on top so that we could use it as like an awkwardly tall table/shelf.  Definitely want to second puppy classes and some kind of treat/clicker training! Our dane is super food-oriented, so treat training has been a god-send; we weren't as diligent with training as we would have liked when she was younger (we had an unexpectedly early move that threw things off for a while) but using treats and positive reinforcement have continued to help us work out some issues and bad habits even now!"
greatdanes,3catng,murryblue,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:43:10 2015 UTC,Having potty trained 4 dogs now I was honestly a little blown away with how easy it was for our Dane. I can count the number of accidents in the first couple weeks on one hand and 0 accidents since. I did have an alarm set for 1am and got up at 5am for the first 3 weeks so that might have helped quite a bit. I would plan on keeping it up if at all possible. Our puppy is only 6 months old but the amount of chaos he can cause even with me standing right next to him is mind blowing. There are mornings where it takes me 10 minutes to figure out where he hid one of my shoes... We have had our dog in training classes for about 3 months now and he responds great to treats. I couldn't recommend committing to once a week classes enough. It's more or less forced me to at least have an hour a week of working with him no matter how busy I get.

greatdanes,3catng,xacmitch19,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:02:20 2015 UTC,"We took him out right before bed at about 9:30-10:00 so the 1am break was about 3 hours. Then back in his crate until 5 with no issues. We got into this routine when he was about 9 weeks, the crate works wonders!"
greatdanes,3catng,tenaciousB123,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:48:44 2015 UTC,"We'll give it a try.  He seems to do better at night than during the day as far as being in his crate and not peeing.

greatdanes,3catng,xacmitch19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:29:46 2015 UTC,Our little guy is 10 weeks tomorrow.  He can make it 2 and 1/2 hours in his crate before he needs to be let out during the day.  At night he seems to make it 3+ hours now.  As we have gotten better at knowing when he needs to go out to go to the bathroom he has made very few mistakes in the house.

greatdanes,3c7d8u,girrrrrrr2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:44 2015 UTC,She is a blue merle. A harlequin would be much more white and black. :)

He barked and growled at the air stream for a minute,  until he realized he was no longer panting."
greatdanes,3bsp65,xacmitch19,2,Wed Jul 1 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"It sounds like it's less him not emptying his entire bladder, and more something to do with his age- a puppy his age can typically hold their bladder for maybe two hours. It will get better as time goes on and as he gets used to the potty routine! I think the general rule of thumb for puppies is something like their age in months + one hour is their absolute ""holding it"" limit? I can't remember exactly.  Typically a puppy isn't going to be reliably house trained until they're about 6 months old, and I've seen some people say that danes can take longer to have full bladder control (I know mine did!) But of course it will vary from dog to dog!"

greatdanes,3bkztk,Marchisio,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:33:05 2015 UTC,"Holy paws!!!  I need some advice on convincing my girlfriend (5'4"") to get one for our small apartment. She's worried that they won't be able to fit with us (I'm 6'4"") in bed, in the car, on the couch, at her parents house, etc. She's also worried about the cost of food and picking up poop that's ""bigger than her head""...  I have a lot to overcome here..."
greatdanes,3bkztk,minimed_18,2,Tue Jun 30 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"Haha i know! And she's only 4 weeks old! I definitely understand the struggle your gf is having. I was actually the one that needed the convincing in our situation. My fiance grew up with danes and has been trying to persuade me to get one for the last 8-12 months. Previously we had been in rentals - apartments, small houses etc. and when we got our home about 6 months ago i knew it was only a matter of time.   I think the main thing for me to get over was that I never had one before, so it was something new and relatively unknown. The size of the dog (and cost of food/toys/etc) can be intimidating as well and I think that kind of culminated into doubting a choice to go forward with getting one. Once we saw her though and especially when I saw how happy it made my soon to be wife, I was done for.   Just keep plugging away my friend. I'm 6'3"" and she's 5'7"" so we're roughly in the same boat. If you do some reading on them you'll find they're very loyal and affectionate dogs. They don't require tons of exercise and are generally pretty laid back. I can also send more pics if that will help lol."

greatdanes,3bk265,RPPUTC,3,Mon Jun 29 21:27:45 2015 UTC,"Hi! I found my rescue Dane last year, and he is the greatest dog. I'm not as much of an experienced owner as others here, but I'll help answer what I can.   Despite my and my apartment's size, could I be a good dane owner and is the apartment big enough?   I am similar in size to you at 5'4 and 120. I'll be honest - when my buddy first stepped out of his transport car to meet me, I panicked. I though there is NO way I could control a dog this size. But he has the sweetest deposition. He doesn't even hurt my chickens! Attending a training class will really help give you confidence on that.   As for your apartment size, I think it should be okay as long as the furniture layout allows him easy navigation. And of course make sure you get him outside to exercise. Maverick is super lazy. I can take him out for a half hour and he'll insist on snoozing for the rest of the afternoon, so I use the term ""exercise"" pretty loosely here.    As for food, I have seen that a dane needs premium and specific food but no site has given a recommendation for adult dane chow.   A lot of users here recommend Taste of the Wild. I use Diamond Large Breed because that's what he came to me on, and he has a really sensitive stomach. It's about $30 for a bag, and I think we go through one every 2-3 weeks.   Otherwise, what would a dane need?    You! He is going to love the shit out of you. And a dog bed, because he's going to sleep pretty much all the time.    I have read that an elevated food dish is necessary to prevent bloating (and that feeding needs to be structured a certain way)   Per our vet's rec, we feed once in the morning and once in the evening. Never allow your pup to exercise for up to an hour after eating due to the risk of bloat - not even a walk around the neighborhood.     Is a crate necessary?    How well behaved is he when no one is home? We continued with Maverick's previous crate training for a few months, but he is such a gentleman that he has free rein of the house all the time now.   A special leash recommended?    How good is he on the leash? A harness couldn't hurt while you learn about each other, but a standard leash is probably fine.   Certain extra tough toys?    Don't get attached to any toys. I just buy them new as the old ones wear out. Those giant braid rope toys are alright, but he swings them around and I'm pretty sure he's gonna break a window some day.    My final concern is monthly costs.   Is he coming to you UTD on shots? If so, it depends on what food you buy and how fast he wears through his toys, so this is hard to answer. I'd say we spend $50 per month on Mav excluding things like annual exams and surprise vet trips.   Good luck! He's going to love you!"
greatdanes,3bk265,elbowss,3,Mon Jun 29 22:48:52 2015 UTC,"Wow! What a fantastic, thorough response. You must be a wonderful owner for Maverick.   I'm glad to know that my size and the apartment don't count me out. As for the other questions you raised, those are definitely going to be some of the things I carry into the conversation with his foster mom when I go speak with her. Thanks so much!"
greatdanes,3bk265,elbowss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:28:03 2015 UTC,"The foster mom should be able to help you with food/treat recommendations and general behavioral issues, so you'll be well prepped when you meet your new best friend. :) They really are the greatest dogs! I wish I had room for more!"
greatdanes,3bk265,Cisco_jeep287,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:13:35 2015 UTC,"All solid questions, so you're on the right track.  ---When my wife & I adopted our deaf rescue, he was about 18 months. Danes are already velcro dogs, and once your rescue bonds to you, expect that to double. Loki is my 120lbs shadow.   ---In my experience, if you are not the dominant person in your pack, your dane will will assume that role. Every dane owner knows about the ""dane lean"". Our trainer actually recommended that I give him a little less attention because he was becoming possessive. He was starting to mouth & try to correct my wife. Once we re-established the pecking order in the household, he really blossomed into a great dog. He felt more secure, became more obedient, etc.  ---We have an apartment that is bigger than yours but we shared the same concerns. His tail does not knock everything over. We try to maximize floor space for him but he still tries to cram under the table when we're sitting. He will pout when we kick him off the couch, but he has to know that I'm going to sit next to my wife. There is no love like a giant dog that just wants his head in your lap. We got a HUGE crate for him. It gives us peace of mind when we're away, and it's a good place to put him when he's not being a good member of the pack and needs to reset for about 10 minutes (read as: tearing through the apartment on a running spree, instigating trouble with our other dog, barking to demand attention).  ---We have family nearby with a big fenced in yard. His current favorite toy is a football that I took some of the air out of. He can get it in his mouth better that way. He's peeled all the leather off of it so I need to get him another one. I like deer antlers better than bones. They last longer and I don't have to worry about his sensitive stomach. They're expensive, so find a good-ole-boy, or a red-neck friend, or someone who hunts and hit them up for an antler. Dogs love em.   ---We used to take him to the local dog park a lot. There are some good apps and YouTube videos about good and bad dog behavior at parks. If you are there to redirect borderline behavior and curb bad behavior before it starts, the park can be a great place to burn off your dane's energy. Not every dog owner is going to be on the same page though. Our trainer has this to say about dog parks: ""You wouldn't let you kid play with thugs and criminals, right? Then don't take your dog to the dog park."" That may be a bit extreme, but I do believe dogs can pick up bad behaviors there.  ---I use a large link choker chain with Loki. I picked one that was a little too long so that he feels the 'click-click' vibration of it getting tight. That technique has worked perfectly with him being deaf, for me. A harness may work well for you throughout training but I prefer the choker. I got a harness and a seat belt attachment for jeep rides. No cham e of jumping or falling out. You should see the stares when the top is down and his head is hanging out. And I try to keep in mind that the choker is going around the broadest part of his neck - which is as big as my thigh. That's a lot of muscle. I'm not hurting him.  ---We've tried Nutro (<sp?), and two others. We found a website that will ship one big bag of Blue Freedom grain free food, every two weeks. We add on a bag of Mother Hubbard treats (good for training) and the shipping was free. Not bad for 25lbs of food. His weight has been holding steady at 125lbs. He eats 3 cups, twice a day. Our other dog eats 2 cups, twice a day. NEVER people food. I'm not about to have a dog that big begging at the table. Blue Freedom is about $50/bag at PetsMart.  ---We tried other brands of higher end food. It made his poo soft, or gave him diarrhea. You'll have to experiment. We asked our vet about a raised dish. He did not recommend it. But Loki isn't very big for a dane.  ---One thing he does recommend however, is to wet his dry food. Loki was getting kinda picky for a while. He would leave a full bowl for 24 hours in protest. He would act hungry and stare at his food, but he wouldn't eat it. After we were sure he wasn't sick, we started to make a pass with his dish under some hot water. I stir it around for a while until it starts smelling strong and looks like it has some gravy going. He LOVES it, and it's better for his digestion.   ---If Loki eats fast, sometimes he'll throw up within 30 minutes. This is horrible - I make him sit after he eats and I scatch his neck and ears. It points his esophagus upward and helps him burp. No more throwing up. I burp my dog like a baby. Maybe he's spoiled, maybe I need a raised dish. Sometimes even an ice cube is too much shock on his stomach and he'll throw up.   ---Expect some diarrhea for the first week or so. The stress of moving and new everything will manifest itself through your dane's sensitive stomach. We use a probiotic with his morning meal when we can afford it. I think the probiotic is about $30/month.  ---Angels of Assis just micro-chipped him for $10. I think they run that special once a year around the 4th of July. I prefer the Scalibor flea & tick collar over the Frontline. It lasts 6 months and I've never seen one flea or tick on either dog. Even with the ticks as bad as they have been over the last 2 years. About $25 online.  ---Take all the pictures you can. Loki is only 3 now and I know he's gonna break my heart when he passes. His first owner in Ohio couldn't understand why he wouldn't listen to him and gave him to a pound. He was put on a short list to get put down. A rescue here in Virginia saved him and fostered him for 3 months or so. We adopted him Christmas eve 2013. I'm not gonna lie, the first 2 or 3 weeks were rough. But we stuck with each other and I wouldn't change a thing. He knows lots of sign language now and nothing but love."

greatdanes,3b8z75,RottingLegion,2,Fri Jun 26 23:06:47 2015 UTC,"How exciting, good luck! I'm very surprised that you guys haven't picked out a food yet.  If you're not sure where to start, ask your breeder what they've been feeding the puppy/what they recommend- no matter what you decide to feed your puppy long-term, you'll have to slowly transition them from what they're eating right now to what you want them to eat instead. If you don't, chances are high that they will get sick because of the sudden diet change.  If you do a quick google search about what to feed dane puppies, you'll see that most people recommend a food with %25 (or less) protein. We fed our puppy the Blue Buffalo Large Breed Puppy food, which has 28% and didn't have any issues.  People are going to come in and suggest a lot of brands, whether you should feed them a raw blend, skipping puppy food all together. Talk to your breeder, talk to your vet, do some research and decide what works for you."
greatdanes,3b8z75,murryblue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"Cool.    Next time do your research.  I don't say this like ""you're an idiot!"" because you didn't research getting a dane, because I did almost no research before getting mine.  But there is going to be a lot of things you need to look into.  Proper times to fix them, generally you want to wait a little longer to do the surgery than other dogs(if at all, according to some).  The different kinds of foods, knowing when they aren't liking the food.  You should definitely get their stomach tacked.  Before that keep them with minimal physical activity for like 30-45 minutes, so if you are crate training feed them in their crate and make them wait before you release them.  I don't think bloat is a huge problem in puppies, but with a puppy you will enjoy the extra time alone (like putting your toddler down for a nap).    You will also have to kind of ""dane proof"" your house.  Have low shelves with something breakable on it?  Well, it's not too low for a dane and they don't know how to be careful with their size when they are young.  Soon they will be able to put their head over the counter, so you can't keep stuff there that they might want.  Chopping food for dinner?  grow eyes in the back of your head for a stealthy dane.  See that corner in the living room with your statue you love so much?  pretty soon that's going to have a mattress on the ground covered in dog hair.    so, just stuff to be prepared for."
greatdanes,3b8z75,RNAPII,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:15:05 2015 UTC,Well we did our research its just that we were waiting for another breeder who wouldn't be ready until September. We ended up going with another breeder so we were not as ready as we would have been in September. Could you tell me more about why we should wait to neuter?
greatdanes,3b8z75,murryblue,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:07:23 2015 UTC,"It can negatively affect their grown and muscle development iirc.  EDIT: that's specifically in regards to neutering. Because they get so big, you want to wait as long as possible to do major surgeries like the stomach tacking because they grow so quickly and so large- you want them to have as little growing left as possible."
greatdanes,3b8z75,RNAPII,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"It's suggested to wait 12-18 months, closer to 18 months if you can deal with a horny dane.  I don't have a specific source, but it's suggested by a lot of people and by all of our vets.  It's because of the way they grow, they need to keep the hormones going or else there can be issues with proper bone growth as far as I can tell.  Some people suggest waiting until two years.    The thing about danes, and most dogs really, is there will be conflicting information everywhere.  So the appropriate thing would ask what other people have done and why with everything from food to basic care.    Do you have other dogs or have you before?  Most dogs it's like 9 months."

greatdanes,3b8z75,senorita_topaz,2,Sun Jun 28 02:33:46 2015 UTC,"Danes can be a bit of a handful as puppys.  Yes, they lay around a lot and are a little more docile than most, but they still get the zoomies and will jump around.

greatdanes,3b005o,ole-gregg,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:56:36 2015 UTC,It's the evolution lol. The inflatable e-collars are much more comfortable and practical than the traditional style. Usually more effective too. However I have had some clients who have told me that they didn't work for their dog and had to go with the cone.
greatdanes,3b005o,sidescrollin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"it really depends on the dog, a long necked dog or long bodied dog can get right past it. Great dane = long neck. Corgi =long body.   It is a good idea but they don't restrict movement enough, they either need to be bigger or come forward more. I'm a fan of the ""comfy cone"" which is a soft padded version of the traditional e-collar"
greatdanes,3b1orf,I_WIPE,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:40:10 2015 UTC,"Someone may come along with some local recommendations, but the best place to start would be looking up local breeders and rescues. Even a broad ""great dane breeders NY"" or ""NY great dane rescue"" google search will give you a good starting point.   Depending on what's available near you and how far you're willing to travel/what kind of arrangements you're willing to make to get a dog to you, you could also expand your search to the general New England area."
greatdanes,3b1orf,murryblue,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"Just google it.  You might have to drive a bit to get it but there should be a breeder close.    Also, getting a dane as a puppy around a 2 year old is not something I recommend.  They are still puppies, just really big and don't know how big they are.  My dane would never intentionally hurt anyone but he hurts me all the time on accident.  Running into me, stepping on my toes, trying to lean on me, whipping me with his tail.....  These things happen with danes, especially when they are puppies.  They grow much faster physically than mentally, so you will have a giant animal running around your house as fast as they can occasionally, imagine a deer getting stuck in your house and trying to run around breaking everything."

greatdanes,3ay9ef,BowmanTheShowman,3,Wed Jun 24 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"Will he be safe for my two small dogs (a chihuahua and a minpin mix)?   This depends on the small dogs.  I have a dane and two jack russells and it was hard for a while.  The Jacks really didn't like him, so I was more worried about the dane than them.  Danes are incredibly sensitive and small dogs like that can be assholes and think they are tough.  The dane will probably just stand and look at them as they bark at him and not know what to do.  Danes can have different personalities, but 99% of what I have seen with danes is they are pretty accepting of other dogs and just want to be friends, the problem is they want to be friends a little too much and it annoys other dogs because they are so big.  My dogs are all friends now, but the JRs will snap at him when he's getting too involved in them.     Is it possible to teach him hand signals since he cannot hear verbal commands?   Yes, My dane will sit and down stay with vocal and sign language just as well.  The only issue I can see is getting his attention without sound, but your dane will adapt.     What's the best way to provide him with the exercise he needs without running him around too much?   Just go on structured walks.  Running with a dane could be dangerous IMO.  Running he's going to be stronger than you and if he doesn't understand that you need to stop he will pull you into the street or something.  Walking is easier.  I have a fairly large back yard and he gets to run around there and we throw balls for him, then he sleeps.  He probably gets four 3 mile walks a week on average but still gets to play outside whenever he wants.    You want to minimize their exercise after meals.  I can't free feed him right now because my oldest JR is a jerk and will eat all of his food, so he usually eats in his crate, then stays in there for 30-40 minutes afterwards, once that JR returns to the hellfire and evil he was spawned from I will free feed him because the other JR can free feed as well.    One thing I didn't think about before getting my dane was he's going to have puppy moments.  Look at videos of dane's getting zoomies.  It's like a cute little puppy running around in your living room chasing his tail, but your house is shaking because it's not a cute little puppy, it's a giant 130 lbs beast bucking around.  I'm a 6 foot man and I could technically ride my dane (DO NOT TRY AND RIDE YOUR DANE).    Another thing about the small dogs is small dogs tend to not be trained as well because their bad behaviors just look cute.  A dane might mimmic some of these behaviors which can be bad with such a large dog.  You will have to be on top of training, but luckily danes are pretty easy to train in my experience, but as with any dog they will act out when they are young.  So, don't let your small dogs train your dane.    Make sure to look up dietary stuff, you need to feed them a bit differently than other dogs.    But they are really great dogs, and I will be getting another one when the Jack Russell Terrorist that was forged in Satan's hellfire passes.    Note:  I don't actually hate my JRs, I just threaten them with violent deaths frequently."
greatdanes,3ay9ef,RNAPII,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"So, don't let your small dogs train your dane.   I didn't consider this. Thank you for that advice! My chihuahua was previously owned by someone who clearly gave her no rules. Definitely going to work more on that."
greatdanes,3ay9ef,dougcornelius,3,Thu Jun 25 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"If you get him as a puppy, he should learn pack behavior with the other dogs on his own. I find little dogs are jerks my danes.  Dogs largely respond to visual signals. My deaf white dane responds to hand signals.  Danes are couch potatoes. They generally do not need much exercise. My white dane could be confused with a house plant.  It takes a lot of energy to move all that weight around."
greatdanes,3ay9ef,a_knows_best,2,Wed Jun 24 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"We've only had our puppy since February but from research i have done, dogs respond better to hand signals than verbal commands alone. We have a dachshund adult and have to watch that their play isn't too rough, but they get along. As for exercise, Great Dane puppies shouldn't be run for the first year or two until they are full grown so you don't damage their joints. So walking or fetch should be good if you spend enough time each day. Good luck and keep us updated!"
greatdanes,3ay9ef,SirHuckalot,2,Wed Jun 24 14:20:06 2015 UTC,"First off congrats and I hope this works out for you! Do you happen to know if the Dane has any other issues and what color is he? I only ask because sometimes a death Dane can mean it has other issues, and it can be caused from breeding Merle Danes together usually resulting in a mostly white Dane. I want you to make sure you know of all conditions before getting a surprise. We own 2 rescues, both white Danes and death, one is kinda blind (I equate her Vision to that of a T-rex, as long as you're moving she can track ya!) the other is pretty much fully blind, she can see some shadows that will spook her. Both are the best and sweetest dogs one could ask for. They share a home with a 11lb Chihuahua and the only problem we have is the Chihuahua being a jerk to them. The Danes will play but they always lay on the ground to interact with Pancho, the only times we have had issues is when he gets underfoot and they might step on him, he has learned to watch out for this! We have them both trained using sign language and touches for the completely blind Dane, it does take a little more practice and patience but they are a smart breed so ours picked it up quickly.  In the end you will find that owning a death dog is no different and you will learn that this breed is the best you will ever own imo! If you have any other questions feel free to PM me."

greatdanes,3ay9ef,Cisco_jeep287,2,Thu Jun 25 13:46:42 2015 UTC,"I've had deaf dane experience, and also experience with many other deaf dogs. I might even prefer deaf dogs to ones that can hear.  The thing to remember is that it's a dog first, a dane second and that it's deaf third.  A deaf dane will exhibit all the standard dane traits.  He'll lean on you, sit on your lap, be in your face and may even slobber all over the place!  My deaf dane, Drake, was the sweetest boy you'd ever meet.  He loved everyone.  He had some vision problems too, but we had zero problems taking him to dog parks and to dog beaches where he could roam, off leash, all he wanted.  He'd start by staying close to us, then as he learned the environment he'd venture farther off.  In some dog parks, he'd wander so far off that he'd be out of sight, but as long as we remained relatively close to where we were when he wandered off, he'd occasionally come running back, sometimes with a really worried look on his face until he got into a range where he could visually recognize us, to reconnect before taking off on another adventure. These dog parks were fenced so that was also a benefit.  When we had Drake, we also had several daschunds and they were fine together.  We also had a smallish deaf pitbull and they were fine together too. We got Drake as a puppy so he was used to the little dogs from day one and there were no issues.  Even with his vision problems, he learned hand signals and sometimes we'd have him wear a collar that would buzz so if we needed him back, we'd buzz him and he'd come find us.  The collars we used were pretty high end training collars and were often seen as being shock collars, but we only ever used the buzz part and he quickly learned that when it buzzed, he needed to come find us. It was a really handy tool that was a great asset to us at first.  We found that he didn't need a whole lot of exercise.  A daily walk and some free time in the back yard was plenty for him.  He had a hearing dane buddy, Raisin, at the same time and we never had issues with them having too much energy they needed to burn off.  Raisin could hear and see fine so he was a big help with Drake. If they were wandering off, we could call Raisin to have them return to us and Drake would always follow.  Thank you so much for thinking of adopting a deaf dog.  I really think you'll quickly realize how special they are and what a positive impact they will have on your life.  For everyone else, HI!! This is my first post here.  I'm going to be a dane owner again in a couple of weeks and will introduce you all to Walter when he arrives.  Imgur  Imgur"

I have taken her to the vet because of it and the best they could suggest would be a protein deficiency that cannot absorb what normal dogs can.

My Jack Russell doesn't like eating and isn't food motivated at all, which results in him being skinny as hell.  He free feeds as it's the only way he'll eat and he always has food around.  Dogs can just be weird sometimes.  You can see my dane's ribs, but every vet comments that he is one of the healthiest danes they have seen."
greatdanes,3ag3mx,vinny-is-a-cat,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:26:16 2015 UTC,"I posted a little bit of information about what I have done for our girl out of concern for her being underweight, and my experience has been the same as yours. We have tried everything we can to make her gain and she has never put on more than a few pounds. The vet we see is unconcerned at this point as she is healthy, energetic, eating fine, and doesn't have anything they've tested for. I wonder if she has trouble absorbing intestinally due to having tapeworms while she was developing, she had them for two years before we rescued her and nobody ever bothered to check her for them until we did. :/"
greatdanes,3aiucy,DJ-Tizzle,4,Sat Jun 20 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Not in the slightest. I work 9-5 and my boy couldn't give two shits. On the weekends he sleeps in longer than I do and on the weekdays he just sleeps in his crate until I'm home, at which point he switches to sleeping on the couch."
greatdanes,3aiucy,dannycalamity,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:31:02 2015 UTC,"Was it difficult when you first got him? I know someone who is in a similar situation to myself, but they have their parents (retired) go by the house to let the dog out. Also, she said she had to take him to the vet like 7 times in the first 5 months. Any health concerns?"
greatdanes,3aiucy,dannycalamity,2,Sat Jun 20 17:50:36 2015 UTC,"Health concerns depend on the breeder/puppy, but there are a ton of shots and surgeries in the first year no matter what. The puppy training itself can be problematic if you can't make it back for lunch so you might consider adopting a 1+ year old as /u/scottley suggested.   Also, be prepared to sacrifice whatever couch you currently own if you do get a puppy and you're not extremely careful. Between accidents and chewing, getting a replacement should be on your short list."
greatdanes,3aiucy,Gazooo,2,Sat Jun 20 18:10:54 2015 UTC,"I leave for work at 6:30 and get home around 7 most nights .... my parents do thankfully let my pooch out after they are finished work around 5:30 and it works well for us! We just hang out a lot on weekends and go for hikes, yadda yadda.   Also - they can be expensive, but I feed raw (4ish pounds a day in total) and I haven't been to the vet except for shots since I adopted (a year and a half ago).   They're giant, they're a little expensive, but so SO worth it if you can afford it and are committed to it"
greatdanes,3aiucy,scottley,3,Sat Jun 20 18:12:46 2015 UTC,"They are not cheap to own. Everything costs more.  They eat alot, require alot of medicine when they get sick, etc...   My general rule of thumb (which also applies to owning a german car) is that if you needing to spend $1000 to fix whatever they just broke (in them or in your home), then owning a Dane may not be right for you.  They are wonderful animals that will bring you great experiences, both good and bad.  Puppies do require more attention and should not be left alone for more than an hour on a regular basis.  If you have a full time job and nobody to help you raise a puppy, then consider a rescue... A yearling or older would probably be a better bet."
greatdanes,3aiucy,RNAPII,2,Sat Jun 20 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"I fed my dane 3x a day as a puppy, which was recommended.  If you aren't able to be home for lunch that might be an issue.  They are going to eat more and require a bit more financially.  I would feel really bad keeping my dane crated all day while I was at work, but if someone is around I wouldn't have an issue.    While yes, they are notorious for being lazy couch potatoes, they also act like any other puppy sometimes, so they will eat your couch and destroy things if left alone long enough (imagine a crazy 140 lbs puppy).  I won't leave mine alone for over an hour out of his crate, but my wife and I work from home so it's not a big deal.    I don't think there is anything really dane specific other than feeding that is different from other dogs.  You will need bigger everything for him, and vet bills will be larger, but day to day my dane gets treated the same as my other dogs.    You will also have to learn where you can leave food.  My dane can drink from the sink in the kitchen, which means anything on the kitchen counter is fair game for him.  He doesn't go after it, but if he was alone for a few hours I think he would."
greatdanes,3aiucy,ArtofStu,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"I just recently got a Dane puppy, about a month and a half ago. I work a rotating shift work schedule, and my SO is a teacher. So 2-3 days a week, the puppy has to be crated for 9-10 hours during the day. I took off 2 shifts the first 2 weeks just to ease him into it, but he really doesn't mind. No accidents, not exceptionally hyper when he comes out. It's not an every day thing, but he does it.  Edit: Oh, and we bought health insurance for him. It's around $55 a month. But when something goes wrong and costs several thousand, I'll feel much more comfortable knowing I have the insurance."
greatdanes,3aiucy,heykachow,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Working full-time and having a puppy (any breed puppy really) might be difficult but it CAN be done. You'd have to work your schedule around them...for example, walk in the morning before work, walk or some sort of playtime on your lunch break, and possibly a walk in the evening as well. Or doggie daycare once they are old enough. Plus obedience classes and other training.   Sounds like you'd be a good fit for an adult rescue Dane if you're set on the breed. Though health/genetic history is spotty at best when you rescue any animal so you could end up with a dog that does get sick often. Yes, vet bills are more expensive but it's really only when you have to do surgery. For routine stuff it's perfectly reasonable. The most I had to spend on my dog so far has been for her spay ($250).   They don't eat as much as you'd think, but it depends on their exercise level. Expect at least $100/mo for food though, $150+ for a giant Dane who is very active.   I feel like getting ONE Dane is not going to break the bank if you have a decent job and aren't hemorrhaging money every month on other things."
greatdanes,3aiucy,twobridges,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"I have a 7 m/o great dane puppy and wouldn't change him for the world! He is normally crated during the day. I leave at 630am and return at 6pm most days. I come home for lunch each day to let him out and feed him. He doesn't need that now as much as he did when he was younger, but I enjoy spending time with him. If I left for work later, around 8am, I wouldn't have any concerns with leaving him all day. Some times to break up the monotony, I take him to day care for the day. It's $17/day, but worth the money, knowing that he's active and socialized while I'm at work. I've watched him (through a puppy cam - I know) while at work and he mostly sleeps all day.   In terms of costs, the only costs we've experienced have been for his second and third rounds of shots (~$300 total) and a vet trip for a little rash ($100).   We feed him a mid-range adult food and spend $40-$50/month.   A puppy is a lot of work, especially when he weighs 80 pounds, but I wouldn't have it any other way! Owning a dane is the best decision I've made!"
greatdanes,3ahlay,sesifeh,2,Sat Jun 20 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"I have an 18 week old male merle, I feed him prairie puppy food and it works great, his coat is nice and he looks strong for his age.  I walk him with a training collar, not the pronged one the chain tightening one but since I do clicker training he picked up the walking pretty fast so I rarely have to correct him.  For training I bought this big tightly wrapped beef sausage looking thing at Petco and cut it in medium squares, he can chew them and swallow quickly as to not distract training and he seems to love them, its like $12 for one big one and they last a while.  I want to take him to a breeder to breed him once before I get him fixed so I couldnt tell you any information on that.    Also I walk him as much as I notice he can handle, I tend to forget he is just a puppy because he is already growing so quickly but just pay attention and he your pup will give you signs.    Good luck and congrats on your new Dane."

greatdanes,3ahlay,Gazooo,2,Sat Jun 20 17:47:17 2015 UTC,"Well I'm pretty positive that great dane puppies are not to be eating ANY brand of puppy food - they are too high in protein for this breed, and could cause serious health issues in the future.  I'd recommend reevaluating your food choice - I feed raw, but that's a personal preference (although very well backed up that it's the best for this breed) ... I'm in a group of over 20 danes in my area - we all feed raw.   I haven't had a vet visit, besides shots, in a year and a half.   Second, you need to find another vet - danes should not be fixed as soon as possible, and them trying to rush you seems like a money grab.   Treats / toys - hot dogs are yucky, and raw chicken is better than cooked.  Antlers are GREAT ... Nylabones not so much.   Gentle leader is great, and I think that's worth a go first.   The key to danes is investing is great food, treats and toys to avoid any sort of health issue. One vet visit with these big guys will cost you a fortune, so it's worth it to spend a little more consistently and have a happy healthy pooch.   Just my opinion, I guess"
greatdanes,3ahlay,Gazooo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:31:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much!  I knew I'd receive some contradicting opinions on food. Do you really think the 3% (25 vs 28) protein difference in foods (between adult and puppy chow) from this same company is really going to cause that much of an issue? Also, isn't feeding raw providing an enormous amount of protein? I've considered feeding raw, but I wasn't going to do that until later in her life, when I don't have to worry about the protein amounts as much. Thoughts?  Again, super duper thank you for your response and your time."
greatdanes,3ahlay,RNAPII,2,Sat Jun 20 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for being receptive!    The raw I feed (Mega Dog Raw) is a pre ground meat mixture that also has organs, all the bones, veggies and kelp and it's only 13% protein :) much better for a growing pup! If you have any raw stores in your area I'd suggest chatting with them more about it!"

greatdanes,3ahlay,ArtofStu,2,Sat Jun 20 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"For treats I generally use Stewart Pro-Treat Beef liver freeze dried.  My dogs love it.  Hot dogs/chicken are fine for the most part, but there is nothing worse than training with a bag full of sweating hot dogs.  freeze dried treats are my favorite.    For beds I have a double mattress, a large carpeted bed and a couch.  My dane uses all of them.    For the vet you should wait over a year to fix your dane.  There is conflicting information all over the place about this topic so you might have to make the decision yourself.  I'm waiting 18 months to fix mine.    Walking and training gear:  I've used all that you have talked about.  They all work fine.  If you use a prong collar, be sure to know how to use it, don't introduce your dog to other dogs/people with the prong collar.  The gentle leader probably works the best in my experience, but something else might work better for your dog.  My other dogs don't do well with it.    Toys are pretty easy.  I pretty much just get cheap stuff and tennis balls.  Kongs are good.  My dogs love basketballs.    For diet I supplement kibble with rice, pureed veggies and other proteins like salmon, chicken, beef, etc.  I use the same kibble for my dane that I use for my Jack Russells, which is high in protein, but the additional food cuts down on the carbs to protein ratio."

greatdanes,3ahlay,ArtofStu,2,Sat Jun 20 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"RE: the Midwest crate. I use it for my girl, and with a few minutes of work you can take it apart and move it; the thing is that it's almost impossible to put together by yourself. You NEED to have someone to help you because it involves juggling multiple pieces at once. If you have help, it's maybe 15 minutes of work to put together, though!  I wouldn't look at a prong/choke collar, as iirc they can damage your dog's throat. I use a combination of a normal collar (it basically just holds her tags/is for my husband because he has trouble with the GL) and a gentle leader. If you'd rather use a more traditional harness to help with pulling, I would look at an easy-walk harness.  As far as getting her fixed goes, it's honestly more of a personal choice if you want to get her fixed before her first heat cycle or later in life. We were advised to wait as long as possible before the first heat to get our girl fixed, because we were also having her pexy done at the same time, and the less growing there is to do, the better. We had her fixed around 7 months.  As far as protein % in food goes, I personally don't think the extra 3% is a huge deal so long as you don't overfeed her; we fed our girl a large breed puppy food that had 28% as well, and haven't had any ill effects on her growth.  Good luck with your puppy, she's a cutie!"

My boy did that frequently too, I was just very vigilant and cleaning up after him continuously. Do you crate train too?"
greatdanes,3a9xuj,damnit_blondemoment,3,Thu Jun 18 12:11:05 2015 UTC,Yes we are crate training him so far only a couple of accidents in the crate and he seems to be responding well to it
greatdanes,3a9xuj,damnit_blondemoment,2,Thu Jun 18 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Good deal! Crate training is absolutely for the best. I crate trained mine too. He's now six years old ( I can't believe how fast time flies.. ) and he has free roam of the house. He's had free roam for about 4.5 years.   If there is nothing going on with your pup aside from the sprinkles of pee when he comes in, it's just his lack of complete bladder control. The next time he goes in for a check up, or shots, or what have you, mention it to your vet just in case there is something else going on that would be more problematic, but my advice would be to just keep up with your training - be consistent, and you will watch his piddles become less frequent in time.   Good luck!"
greatdanes,3a9xuj,niccig,3,Thu Jun 18 15:25:20 2015 UTC,Have you asked your vet about this? It sounds more health-related than behavioral. You could also try just staying out a little longer.
greatdanes,3a9xuj,bernardmoss,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:52:35 2015 UTC,"As someone has already said, it's likely that his bladder has not matured enough. I remember bringing my boy into the vet around six months because I was sure he had a bladder infection. Most times he would make it outside, but quite often he would pee and walk around the house or up the stairs. Once a day we'd have to clean the stairs, he'd pee on the walls while running up or down the stairs. We went through a ton of paper towels and spray. It went on for a long, long time. It was arduous and we almost considered getting rid of him (not really). But then somewhere around 9-12 months, it just stopped. Since then he has not peed in the house once and can hold his pee for probably 10-12 hours if need be."

greatdanes,39t8l4,bader175,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:31:41 2015 UTC,"First night was rough. He willingly went in the crate when he was tired, and passed out. But every hour he woke up and started whining. So not much sleep, but I think we have been making progress with the crate training. How has your first few nights going?"
greatdanes,39t8l4,bader175,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:11:57 2015 UTC,They were a nightmare. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep max. Neighbors rang the bell at 4am to ask what the whining sound was.

greatdanes,38u30d,durturd110,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:59:32 2015 UTC,"We have a puppy Great Dane right now in a condo, and he's doing amazing! My husband works from home, so he keeps a very close eye on him. Great Danes actually make great condo dogs because they don't bark a lot and they don't need a lot of exercise (I walk ours 2 times a day 30 mins to 1 hr, we live next to a dog park). They are very chilled out dogs, so you don't have to worry much about that. So far our great dane gets a long with anything that comes to it (bird, rabbit, cats, other dogs, people).  Our dane learned to love his crate very very quickly...took about a week for him to get use to his crate. Potty training, he learned very quickly as well. But please don't think training your potential Great Dane would be the same, every dog is different...we just got lucky with ours. He is extremely calm for a puppy and doesn't really bark a lot. He now goes in his crate by himself to sleep at night. Great Danes are fairly easy to train, but you have to be consistent...just like with any other dog. Life expectancy- things that can potentially save your dog is doing a pexy surgery. This can save a great danes life....bloat is extremely common with great danes...so please please consider this surgery if you are getting him/her. Feeding your Great Dane high quality food, which you probably already know. Watch the protein and fat lvls for sure and calorie counts. Right now, our pup has almost gone through a 28lb bag  in a month. Costed us about $75 bucks. If you feed your dog high quality food...you could be spending $65-$100 a month on food. Also maybe consider a high rise food plate, watch how fast he/she eats and drinks water (these are all things that can help prevent bloat). Also ask where they bought their great dane....did she buy him/her at a puppy mill/BYB or a licensed breeder who actually knows what they are doing? Ask questions about the great danes parents? How old are they? These are things to look at as well. But this won't guarantee you that the great dane will live over 8+ years. I have heard some great danes that lived to 11 years but I don't think that is very common.  Any ways sorry if this doesn't make sense (typing through phone), everyone has different opinions on  how to take care of their danes. Great Dane lady website has wonderful information that can really help you. I suggest looking her up. Great Danes are wonderful wonderful dogs! Hope I helped a bit.  Also I'll like to add that I am not an expert...I am still learning and any advice from others is greatly appreciated."
greatdanes,38u30d,RNAPII,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:25:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice! I really appreciate it.
greatdanes,38u30d,scottley,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:00:50 2015 UTC,"You will need to prepare for their diet, but everyone has so many different opinions it's really hard to really decide.  I use a high quality kibble with higher protein than we should be using, but I supplement it with rice and pureed veggies so the total protein is lower.  My dane is considered to be in excellent health.    For age it depends.  I have heard of them getting to 12 pretty frequently but bloat and other issues probably lower the average.  I would say 10-11 is more what I would expect with my dane.    Dane's and shepherds are pretty similar in costs I would imagine.  Though grooming with shepherds is probably more time consuming, but danes might eat more.    My dane loves everything, I would be more worried about your cat not liking the dane.  My dane is very interested in other things that move around.  He's always gentle but gets a little invasive sometimes.  It could just be him, though.    All dogs are going to bark occasionally.  Mine barks primarily at the neighbors cat when he goes out onto the deck.  You could use a bark collar, but a lot of people don't suggest them for Dane's because they tend to be really sensitive.  I don't use one for my Dane because he's usually pretty quite, but the bark is very loud.  I use bark collars on my jack russells because they are annoying shits and they deserve it (not all the time).  I know people can sometimes be really against bark collars, but if you met my Jacks you would either take them to the farm or fold and give them a collar.    You should be able to teach and control the dane with training.  They are pretty easy to train as they tend to be pretty simple in mental capacity.  You should probably get an EZleader or some other training aid if you are worried about it, but depending on the size of the specific dane it probably wouldn't be too different from walking a GSD.  My dane is really clumsy on walks and will frequently run into me and knock me around, so that is the only thing.  He's like a giant wobbly noodle."

greatdanes,38u30d,joeomar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"My first dane, Blue, lived to 13, i have a 9 year old and a 2 year old currently.  Danes and shepherds are very similar.  Both are large, smart, and prone to hip/joint issues, etc.  If i had a shepherd, i would not treat it differently than my danes.  I feel like shepherds have a little more energy than Danes.  I think rescues are a noble cause, but especially with a Dane or a Shepherd, there is so much risk in veternarian care and, heaven forbid, a bite or other such accident, you have to be very careful and get to know the dog for a while before adopting.    Based on my 3 minutes of getting to know your situation, i assume you've spent some time with Harley... If so, I would lean that way."

However the rescue I am working with has all their dogs in foster homes with kids, cats and dogs. So the foster knows the dog very well in a ""home like"" setting. They stay there for at least a month before being put up for adoption. I am still unsure of what to do. I love both breeds but am kinda leaning towards the rescue. I love shepherds and danes but my active lifestyle makes me want a shepherd. Still not sure.."

He's never had any health problems at all. He turned 9 today and still acts like a three year old. Based on his longevity so far and his lack of health problems, I believe he has a very good chance of still being with me at least two or three years down the road."

greatdanes,38u30d,starliz,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Diet is a frustrating issue. When I first got Harlan, the breeder (a ""low-protein"" believer) recommended her diet of 1/2 Bil-Jac Adult and 1/2 el-cheapo Purina. However, he had really loose stools (almost continuous diarrhea), so I tried various products until I settled on Eukanuba, which solved the problem. Your situation may quite likely be different.  They're great dogs, astoundingly loyal and devoted, with a bizarre penchant for cuddling. Harl likes nothing more than us taking afternoon naps together, he'll flop over on top of me and just start snoring away... People try to joke that he thinks he's a lap dog. I tell them he really is a lap dog, we just have ergonomic issues."

It looks like the links got a little jumbled, though- they don't lead anywhere as-is :( Hope you don't mind me linking them here for clarity? I'd hate for someone to miss out on your handsome boy <3  one & two"
greatdanes,38ly59,murryblue,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:30:41 2015 UTC,Thank you!!  I was on mobile so that doesn't always work to well lol
greatdanes,38ly59,longjohntaller,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:13:07 2015 UTC,Congratulations. That's an awesome name by the way. Good Luck :)
greatdanes,38ium4,PettyOost,4,Thu Jun 4 14:39:38 2015 UTC,"My Dane is about a year and a half now. When he was that age, he was actually eating between 6-9 cups a day. It was a large breed puppy food. At about a year old, he stopped eating nearly as much. We feed him Merrick Grain Free now, and he eats about 5 cups a day, usually. They really do mellow out with their eating as they get older. Your puppy seems to be on the right track, don't worry about it!"
greatdanes,38ium4,VikingPrincessOG,2,Thu Jun 4 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This put me at ease. He is a bit skinny right now because he had to go on a special diet because of stomach issues/our first vet making bad decisions for him. The new vet put him on a weight loss diet for a few weeks and it solved the problem, but obviously made him loose weight."
greatdanes,38ium4,VikingPrincessOG,2,Thu Jun 4 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"It's my pleasure! Our Dane got Parvo around 6 months of age, even though he was vaccinated. So he had a special diet too.  He ate so much and it took him forever to gain back the weight. I was so scared that he would always eat that much and eat me out of house and home! Haha. But everything's wonderful now."
greatdanes,38ium4,Fortold,4,Thu Jun 4 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"my girl is on 3.5 twice a day, 8 mos.  if you pup is staying lean (last rib showing) than your doing just fine.    side note, i agree wiht Viking, they certainly mellow about the food as they age.  2 months ago our pup would rush through her food every time like there was no tomorrow.  just this morning i had to prod her off the couch to eat breakfast!"
greatdanes,38ium4,NickosaurousRex,3,Thu Jun 4 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks! He is probably too skinny right now as he just got off a weight loss diet that was used to fix a stomach issue he had going on. This diet wasnt meant for him to lose weight, but was a side effect to fixing the original problem. I am hoping he packs on a few pounds now that he is off the special food."
greatdanes,38ium4,NickosaurousRex,3,Thu Jun 4 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"Dane puppies will eat much more than their big brother and sisters. They grow rapidly and need the extra nutrients to help them along the way. Watch his weight and feed him accordingly. He also may need a more hearty food. Look for foods that don't have corn or wheat or some sort of grain filler as a main ingredient. Stray away from grain in general, but rice is OK.   With a heartier food, he'll require less and he'll eat a little slower. Also get a slow feeder bowl if you'd like. Some dogs just like to eat fast. My biggest like to eat fast because he thinks our little one wants his food.  Edit: spelling."
greatdanes,38ium4,Spark_of_Insanity,2,Thu Jun 4 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I actually just bought him a kong bowl. It helped a little, but i am hand feeding probably half of the food before putting the rest in it.  I am already looking for alternative foods. I had him on totw sierra mountain first, then he got sick and we arent sure if the food originally caused this or not so we are a little timid putting him back on it."
greatdanes,38ium4,Spark_of_Insanity,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:19:46 2015 UTC,"Glad I can help. Also watch protein percentage. For danes, low protein is best (21-23%).nothing over 24%. TOTW has a whopping 29%. Feeding a growing Dane high protein can cause Wobblers Disease and Panosteitis. It could have been hurting his stomach too.   We gave our oldest a slightly high protein food and his stomach didn't like it too much. Switched to a lower protein and he hasn't had problems since.   Some things are just hard on their stomachs."
greatdanes,38ium4,tylerthehun,2,Thu Jun 4 16:42:06 2015 UTC,That seems normal. We leave food out for our great dane and he eats when he wants and doesn't eat when he doesn't want to. When he was growing he was probably eating at least 6-9 cups a day. Great danes tend to be picky eaters from what I've heard so congrats on finding a food that they will eat a lot of.
greatdanes,38ium4,DonKnots,2,Thu Jun 4 17:55:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, ours is not picky yet. Havent found a single thing he wont try eat.  Weve tried a few different foods, and plan on switching him again once we are sure his stomach issues are done.."
greatdanes,38ium4,starliz,2,Thu Jun 4 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"We've been pretty lucky with the Purina Pro Plan. Our dane is weird and likes the small bits lamb and rice formula, but we tend to like Purina Pro Plan."
