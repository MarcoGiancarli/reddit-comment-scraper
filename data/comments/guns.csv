He took me around and did basically everything gun-related with me (first bb gun, first time shooting clays, first CCW class, etc.) at every stage of my life. I was over at my grandpa’s helping him clean some guns since his wrists aren’t what they used to be and he mentioned he had something for me since I had recently started to get into revolvers more heavily. I couldn’t believe it when he went and pulled this beauty out. I’d only seen it once before, on a shooting trip a long time ago.   It’s a Smith & Wesson Model 66-1 with the 2.5” barrel. Grandpa said he bought it sometime in the 70s. It’s amazing, feels great and everything is so incredibly smooth. He also gave me an extra set of larger grips, which are much more comfortable than the stock grips. I can’t wait to take it to the range this weekend."

I do not have a great picture that shows this, but basically there is a small slit in the top of the barrel. You can kind of see the little bump in the top image in this image.    That slit in the barrel only allows it to go in one direction because it is a pretty tight fit.    However, when trying to raise funding to manufacture this gun, Schubarth stated that:   For army use a ridge may be formed entirely around the cartridge and filled with fulminating powder, in place of the wire, and cap, so that the cartridge may be inserted in any position. But for sporting it is more economical to adopt the arrangement represented, as the same case may be refilled and used many times.     Basically he could've created a more expensive rimfire variation that could have been inserted any way."

guns,3e0wwi,bandon16,4,Tue Jul 21 17:03:34 2015 UTC,You would need to draw out the brass in a set of dies I would imagine.  This takes large specialized machines as far as I know.  I would love to even get a repro for my collection.

guns,3e0wwi,Domodude17,4,Tue Jul 21 16:21:06 2015 UTC,Interesting. So the inventor was trying to burn the available powder more efficiently by centering the primer? I guess he felt the pod shape would better redirect the power forward?
guns,3e0wwi,rafri,3,Tue Jul 21 16:27:12 2015 UTC,Very plausible. The idea of the shaped or hollow charge has been around since the late 1700s.
guns,3e0wwi,19Kilo,3,Tue Jul 21 16:49:18 2015 UTC,Yes. There were quite a few designs around this time period that played around with placing the primer in the middle or at the base of the bullet. Black powder did not burn as fast so they were trying to alleviate so much powder still burning as it traveled out the end of the barrel. By making the explosion travel backward first it helped.
guns,3e0wwi,19Kilo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:19 2015 UTC,in 1861 Mr. Schubarth said that “It will be seen that the powder is fired in the middle of the charge thus causing a rapid combustion [and] that this causes so great force be generated that 60 grains of powder has driven bullet through 15 one inch boards at a distance one hundred yards.   And this is talking 1800's lumber which usually was MUCH stronger than the crap we build houses with now.

guns,3e0wwi,Vanhugenstein,11,Tue Jul 21 10:48:47 2015 UTC,What were cartridge designers thinking in the mid 19th century? It would make a little more sense from a manufacturing stand point for it to have strait walls.

guns,3e0wwi,Vanhugenstein,9,Tue Jul 21 04:08:47 2015 UTC,I think patent laws have a lot to do with it as well.  When someone patents a metallic cartridge others have to come up with a design that they can market without infringing on patent laws.

guns,3dzf75,OmniaMors,76,Mon Jul 20 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"So I got to talking with /u/dotMJEG and /u/SpiveyArms about how far a 308 round could go if shot at a high angle. Well it escalated relatively quickly and I ended up making am FEM calculator for it.  First off let me explain what an FEM calculator is. When you shoot a round, from the time is leaves the barrel to hit the target, there are an infinite number of points in time. So to calculate this we use continuous equations, like F=ma or d=do+vo*t+0.5a*t2. But once you add complex equations like drag, its no longer easy (if possible) to do that. So instead we cheat by breaking it up into a finite number of points. We can use the velocity, angle etc. at a single point, and use it to calculate things like drag, which in turn can be usetp find the velocity of the next point. With tools like excel we can have thousands of points which makes this method of estimation super accurate.  That being said there are some flaws.   I used a constant drag, even though it changes with velocity I used constant air density even though it changes with altitude I only used 3000 points, which is relatively small I assumed the bullet always faced the direction of travel, which eliminates drag around the bullet (so its just along it) I did not separate and recombine x and y axis velocities when moving from drag to integration G1 instead of G7 other minor assumptions and roundings   Why? I'm fucking lazy so fuck you.  But really, this math is go estimate the distance a bullet could travel at most. So being off a couple hundred feet doesnt actually matter. Fun fact any ballistic calculator uses this exact same method, just without most of the sources of error I listed."

guns,3dzf75,PaurAmma,32,Mon Jul 20 19:56:34 2015 UTC,"Lol I mean the coefficient of drag changes with velocity. So in the function  Fdrag=1/2*pair densityAbullet areacdrag(vvelocity)2  I kept everything but v constant when in reality, p, c, and v all change."
guns,3dzf75,HueyCobra,5,Mon Jul 20 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, ok. How come? Seems like having a v2 drag term isn't really any less complicated than having a more general function of v. You're already outside the territory of linear differential equations."
guns,3dzf75,bob_smoosh,3,Mon Jul 20 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly because changes in v affect the results disproportionately, what with it being squared, and p and c only have a linear effect."
guns,3dzf75,HueyCobra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"Since they're all multiplied together though, it doesn't really matter whether those dependencies come from v or from the coefficient."
guns,3dzf75,PaurAmma,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll try to keep this fairly simple, even though you seem to have a scientific background.  The above equation describes the drag for an object traveling through a fluid. The drag coefficient, cdrag, is a unitless number that is mainly characterized by Reynold's number, Re. Re is the inertial forces divided by the viscous forces of the fluid through which the object is traveling. Long story short, Re is constant for high velocities. Since Re is essentially constant, cdrag will also be constant at these velocities.   Obviously, Abullet is constant. This leaves us with velocity and air density. As a general rule, we can assume that there will be no large temperature or elevation change between the firing point and the impact point. So, air density also stays the same for a given shot.  This leaves us with only the velocity of the bullet. This term dominates the equation (in this case) since muzzle velocities are high and the term is squared. Now, the drag force will change as the bullet proceeds along its path, as the force will affect the velocity with each delta t. This will affect the velocity significantly at longer distances. So, changing the velocity is what dominates the bullet distance in this theoretical situation.  I hope that helps explain the reasoning behind his choice and why, theoretically, his laziness is justified."
guns,3dzf75,count_chockula,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense mostly. Bullet area is of course constant, ρ is approximately constant. If you say cdrag is approximately constant, I'll take your word for it--I have no background in aerodynamics.  What I was really responding to was    Lol I mean the coefficient of drag changes with velocity   That struck me as odd, because if the coefficient of v2 is itself a function of v, well then it doesn't actually make much sense to call it a ""coefficient."" The whole thing (by ""whole thing,"" I mean cv2 ) could just be replaced with some other f(v). Since we're doing numerical simulation anyway and not looking for some closed-form expression, it doesn't seem like that really loses us much (as long as f(v) is something we actually know or can approximate).  But I get that the approximations he made were sensible, especially since all of this was abstracted out in the G1/G7 calculation, and he didn't want to mess with it."
guns,3dzf75,HueyCobra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:59:21 2015 UTC,"Assume that v, p and c change at the same rate. The changes in v will always have a higher effect than changes in p and c, and since they are less likely to change contrary to v at the same time, it is a more or less reasonable simplification to disregard changes in p and c.  p would probably vary in a fashion different from c, since p is a function not only of height, but also of local temperature, among other factors, and c should be mainly dependent on v, but not entirely, if I am not mistaken.  At least that's how I understand it. I stand to be corrected."

There are common load ranges that are known to be solid for certain guns which are at a major node, usually the shockwave will go to the muzzle, reflect backwards and when it returns to the receiver the bullet should exit fairly consistently.  Keep in mind there are other nodes to this shockwave but every gun is its own beast.  These differences in precision firearms are small so you only really see it if you are concerned about long range.  I am not an ABET accredited engineer but I'm well reed."

Extremely sophisticated finite element/finite difference/spherical particle dynamic methods exist to model not only many different types of explosions, but also very complicated contact/metal plasticity problems like a bullet being fired out of a gun. LS-DYNA is probably the best-developed software package that has these capabilities. Moreover, well-established methods exist for 'seeding' FE meshes with imperfections to try to determine whether the exact shape of the structure (in this case, machining defects, wear, etc) will influence vibration characteristics. At least in a statistical sense. The problem here lies not in the technical impossibility but that these types of analyses are extremely expensive and time consuming, at least currently.

He's not asking about any barrel of a certain shape but a specific barrel he wants to build. His question requires knowing the imperfections of that particular barrel.  He specified bullet path, so I'm fairly sure he's trying to use a design and a computer to predict his bullets path relative to the barrel. Like sighting in his barrel design without shooting it."

guns,3e34m0,elixerboi,3,Tue Jul 21 19:01:23 2015 UTC,I think 300 yards is kind of the extreme end for 300 BLK.  It's considered a pretty good round from an AR-15 for hogs and such at closer to mid-ranges.  6.5 and 6.8 are going to be better for your longer range shots.  I'd really consider an AR-10 in .308  just to have a more common ammo type rather than go with 6.5 and 6.8.

I ask because if you want an M4/AR-15 style rifle instead of a normal bolt action, an AR-10 in .308 would be a great compromise.  Yes it would be unethical to hunt deer/elk/big game with .223, especially if you ever get farther out in distances.   6.5/6.8 would be okay too, but they would not be as common as .308 for retail ammo, which you say you will be using.

guns,3e0def,JakesGunReviews,6,Tue Jul 21 00:02:23 2015 UTC,"Try putting some lithium grease and CLP on your muzzle and FSB threads.  You'll want to get into the habit of checking on them every once in a while since these types of muzzle brakes force some gases back through the threads.  Left unattended, even non-corrosive ammunition can start making the muzzle device and FSB threads want to rust into one another.  Don't want that to happen.  The grease and CLP should also help keep it pretty easy to remove/install.  My Russian friend mentioned that they did the same thing that I do while in the military, as well, which is something I've come to call the ""two-click rule.""  I only tighten my 24x1.5mmRH devices to two clicks.  First click is when the plunger first secures the device, then I depress it and tighten it until it clicks a second time.  That's where I leave it.  There's nothing wrong with tightening it further, of course, but two clicks is good enough.  Some day I wish to see if one click v. fully tightened makes a difference in regards to accuracy.  I don't think it will, though.  Also, mind cross-posting to /r/ak47?

guns,3e0rqn,Dismalhead,3,Tue Jul 21 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"The little bit of reading I've done mentioned Tula quite a bit and most owners saying they looked for them when shopping for an SKS.

guns,3e0rqn,bodie221,4,Tue Jul 21 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"The only thing to keep an eye on with an SKS is the firing pin.  If you let it get really dirty or let debris get inside the firing pin channel, it can get stuck in the forward position, which can cause slamfires (pull charging handle back, rifle fires all rounds in the magazine without you even touching the trigger).  To check on it, just remove the bolt from the carrier and shake the bolt.  The firing pin should move freely back and forth.  That's all you have to do:  make sure the firing pin can move freely back and forth.  If it doesn't, clean it (should be videos on YouTube on how to disassemble the SKS bolt).  Here is my album over the SKS (Type-56 in particular) in case you need to know more about the features of your rifle:  http://imgur.com/a/JUH8P  Most everything here is applicable to the Russian models."

guns,3dygd3,Africa_Whale,14,Mon Jul 20 17:51:56 2015 UTC,"When in fact, the way milliradians is supposed to be used is in meters not yards. Why you ask? Because at 100m one mrad is 10cm of distance, and therefore one click (or 0.1mrad) is 1cm. Fantastic, so what you say... Well the math stays easy as you move further, so 1mrad at 200m is 20cm, and at 500m 1mrad is 50cm, and 700m.... you guessed it, 1mrad is 70cm.   Long live the metric system  *Edited to correct the math"
guns,3dygd3,salahaddin,4,Mon Jul 20 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"It is entirely not relevant what unit is used for distance, we are talking about circles here. It works for any distance measuring unit.  At 1000 car-lengths, 1 mil is 1 car-length.  At 1000 inches, 1 mil is one inch. At 1000 football fields, 1 mil is 1 football field."
guns,3dygd3,GoodArrow,2,Tue Jul 21 05:12:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, my point was that using yards and inches with mrad is more difficult for no reason. One good example is at 150m 1 mrad is 15cm, well 150yds it's 3.6""*1.5=5.4"", so there's unnecessary math in my opinion, whereas in the metric system it can ask be done in your head quickly"

guns,3dygd3,qa2,5,Tue Jul 21 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"It is easy. The problem people have that are using imperial is when they start with yards but want a result in inches. E.g. someone is 500 yards away, how many inches is 1 milrad.  It's easier if you use the same unit everywhere. The only reason it's so simple with metric is because converting between units is easier since it's all about moving a decimal."

guns,3e2cki,djm87us_,5,Tue Jul 21 12:34:44 2015 UTC,"What is your intended use? I have both along with a P224. I tend to carry the P224 in warm weather and the P229 or P226 in colder. Very happy with all 3 of them.  The P229 is shorter but the slide and frame feel a bit thicker than the P226, the P226 while longer has a slightly slimmer profile. (Neither the P229 or P226 have the new E2 grips so not sure if that still holds true). Dimensions and barrel length are really the only differences between the P226 and P229.  If you are planning on carry they are both on the heavier side but can be carried with a good holster and belt."
guns,3e2cki,Seabass18,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, both have similar grip sizes, like the glock 17/glock 19. Amusingly, the sig p220, 226, & 229 can all technically interchange slides, the primary difference between them being the locking block (which is compatible between the 220/226), and the ejector.  All this just means the frames are effectively the same, though different grip panels tend to make one seem larger than the other."
guns,3e2cki,myfaceit,4,Tue Jul 21 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"If this is a carry gun, 229 or the M11-A1. Smaller profile and easier to hide. The 226 is a big honkin gun and you will have to dress around it.   Nightstand gun or range toy? 226 all day, everyday. They're incredible guns."

It doesn't have have a rail and its a little heavier than a modern P226 like the MK25 but it's a beauty.   You can't go wrong either way. Make sure you pick up some 18 round flush fitting mags.

guns,3e07io,frixionburne,9,Mon Jul 20 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"TLD;DR: New Rooty Tooty Point-N-Shooty goes bang after every click.  I picked up my P220 10mm Nitron last week off Gunbroker from Keely Arms in Ohio. Today was the first test at the range!  This version of the P220 is an SAO with an ambi thumb safety.  The gun comes with two 8rd mags from the factory (single stack), G-10 Hogue grips, a factory SRT, and I took advantage of the $200 Sig rebate on new P220 purchases for this month.  Tested ammunition was Blazer Aluminum 10mm 200gr and Remington UMC 10mm 180gr.  About 100 rounds through it today, and not a single FTF or FTE. The rear sight being an adjustable combat sight, favors a center hold, and it shoots far better than I can.  The first few slow shots on the first target were oddly accurate for standing around 30 feet away on a Shoot NC 6"" target. Standard 15 foot shots are almost impossible to miss. I have a tendency to push shots left with my P320, however this seemed to allow for a better grip, and I seemed to be off by far less than I am with my 9mm.  The gun is heavy, weighing close to 3.5lb's loaded if my scale is at all accurate, however all that mass makes shooting 10mm feel lighter than 9mm.  If you like 10mm's, and you don't want a 1911 or a Glock, get one of these."
