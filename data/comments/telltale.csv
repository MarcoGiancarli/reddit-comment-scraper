In the end, I chose to have Asher stay behind because I feel like he knew Rodrik needed to remain lord in order to save their house, and that if Asher was willing to go through all of his previous trouble for his family (as I was playing him), he would definitely be willing to go through with this one last sacrifice for them. Plus, I was definitely not about to let Rodrik die at the hands of Gryff, that bastard needs to be killed, by Rodrik.  I feel like it fit well from a story point of view, and the goodbye between Beskha and Asher was so heart wrenching it kind of solidified the choice for me."

telltale,3e34pw,IAMLukeBailey,15,Tue Jul 21 16:23:44 2015 UTC,"Why does everything have to be either a game or a movie? It's nice to see something in-between. The fact of the matter is that Telltale's stories would not work as movies, nor would they be well served by putting in traditional gameplay sections. It would just slow down the narrative.  I disagree with you about environmental interaction. In fact, I think they need more of it. It's a great way to take in your surroundings and allow you to talk to whichever character you want. But I'm totally with you when it comes to QTE's. It's completely immersion breaking to have a giant ""Q"" pop up on the screen. Either cut the action scenes entirely, or come up with a more immersive way of doing it."
telltale,3e34pw,QuizzicalButthead,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying. To me, the ""in between"" style just invites unflattering comparisons to movies and full-on games, because they can't quite measure up to the highs of either."
telltale,3e34pw,ReihEhcsaSlaSthcin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:11 2015 UTC,And that's a step backwards for video games how?
telltale,3e34pw,Fragmentalist,4,Wed Jul 22 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"I just wish they wouldn't just keep sticking to the same formula. Currently they're filling their plates with things such as Minecraft and running their beloved Walking Dead seriesinto the ground with the promise of a third season. I just wish every game they released was different from the next (think Life is Strange) instead of simply being another platform for existing media.  I also don't really care for the episodic format. This is what Netflix is trying to do away with. Instead of trying to rush out a new episode every 8 weeks (and failing) I just want Telltale to take their time before they run themselves into irrelevancy.  I love Telltale's new era of games, I really do; but without any kind of innovation I can't say that I will be able to continue doing so."
telltale,3e34pw,QuizzicalButthead,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:25 2015 UTC,"Keep your eye on Firewatch. Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman were the driving forces behind The Walking Dead Season 1, and they left Telltale mid-Season 2 to start their own studio. Firewatch is their first game. They showed it off at E3, and it looks really interesting."
telltale,3e34pw,Fragmentalist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Just watched some videos on it and it definately looks interesting! Imagine playing that in VR though.. I'll keep an eye out!
telltale,3e34pw,PastryChefSniper,2,Tue Jul 21 22:43:49 2015 UTC,"You have some well thought out points here and I can see where you're coming from (I'm upvoting for that reason), but I'm going to have to disagree.  The way you approach it is that these games which resemble interactive cinema are shackled to an old form of media - they are not using the new medium to its fullest extent. That's certainly true - Telltale style games are not great as games.  I look at them differently. These interactive stories are in fact an evolution of film and television. They use the language of those media, they immerse us in long-form visual storytelling in similar ways, but they use the tools of video games (interactivity) in purposefully limited ways to create greater emotional and intellectual investment in the story. The founders of Telltale apparently debated long and hard whether to include the ""Games"" in their company name, and only did so because of marketing necessity. To me, the idea of telling television-style stories using the tools of games was not at all lazy - it was in fact highly creative, just as the early film innovators who decided to tell complex, character driven stories were creative to move beyond simple static scenes, even if their works could be seen as derivative of novels. There is no ""forward"" for stories to go in any medium. There are just different directions, and ones which meld in elements of other media are just as legitimate as ones that focus on finding the ways to utilize their tools as differently as possible.  I'm moving a bit beyond what you said here, and this isn't meant to be a criticism of your point of view, but I thought I'd bring it up anyway since it's related. A broader frustration I often see surrounding Telltale is that the ""choices don't matter"". People point to things like how a character that you save will inevitably die some time after. My opinion is that: 1) The choices do matter - in that they help you invest yourself in the narrative, putting yourself into the head of the character making the choice and being a part of the evolving character relationships, and 2) The choices should not matter more than they do, at least with the resources currently available for writers and whatnot. In a story that's meant to be like an interactive television show, I am ""playing"" because I want to see the most satisfying story the writers can tell, not so I can do anything I want. The choices in Telltale games (that word again...) are a way for the writers to help bring you into their vision, to meet the player in the middle, rather than to fundamentally direct the story. They are there to help the player add an emotional texture to the storyline that suits them. In fact, allowing too much player freedom would undermine the point of these stories - that you often can't do everything right, that there are always bad consequences. If you could save two people rather than just one if you ""played the game right"", there would be a huge temptation to see that as the ""proper"" result rather than accepting the importance of death to the story.  Finally, I'll defend Telltale on one last point you bring up: Those admittedly totally unsubtle ""So and so will remember this"" pop-ups. You're right that those would be silly in an actual television show - and at least in some of the games (not sure about all) you can turn them off. But in interactive stories like this, I think they can be helpful in reminding the player that their choices have an emotional impact, adding to the investment in the relationships between the characters, etc. - things that are obviously inappropriate in a medium where you're not playing a particular character. Seeing ""Clementine will remember this"" a few times in my first experience with The Walking Dead helped me realize what this game (I guess I'm still calling it that) was doing, and that it was about the kind of relationship I would forge with this character moreso than what kind of big events would play out onscreen. Certainly it shouldn't be used in all ""interactive cinema"", but I don't think it was a bad choice.  Anyway, that was a lot of rambling. But playing through the first two seasons of The Walking Dead recently was one of the most powerful experiences with art that I've ever had, and I think a big part of that was Telltale's choice to balance televisual and game elements rather than pushing too far into interactivity."
telltale,3e34pw,tomdopeytom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:06 2015 UTC,"Some quick time events DO change things. It's true they are less interactive, but at the end what you have tailored is a different character or a different relationship with some of them. I watch gameplays and their main character is sometime WAY different than MY main character, all solely based on the decisions which, even if they don't change the story itself (And I agree it would be nice to have it changed in a bigger way thanks to our decisions), they decide if our character is going to be either a ruthless, ungrateful bitch or a nice and caring hero.  I do agree Telltale hasn't been doing super great lately. But if they decide to go with a main story and just let us have decision that will change the characters and relationships rather than the actual story, then they are free to do so.  I remember when I was younger and I was watching TV, I would grab the controller and pretend I was controlling what the characters would do and say (When I wasn't actually playing videogames). And now I think this is a nice, new way of storytelling. Why games SHOULDN'T try to be tv shows or movies?? There are different kind of games, some games are stylized to have that format and there is nothing wrong with that. Some other games have cutscenes playing that role, and when they are interactive, yes, they might be fully interactive (There are always limits though), what how about when you have to follow a mission or a task or something? If you fail, you restart and do it again. You kill who they tell you to, when they do. In some Telltale Games, if you say ""the wrong thing"", you can keep playing. If your character fucks up and gets someone killed, SOMETIMES you don't have to start over and you can carry on with what happened. Even if it's an illusion of choice as everyone calls it because of the fact that the story will remain the same no matter what you do, you have more choices than in lots of games. I agree with you that this is not as interactive as most games, but you shouldn't be so close-minded."

Echo Eye: Provides very funny descriptions of things, and can help fill in the lore for those who haven't played the main Borderlands games.

telltale,3dl7e0,BlazeCrowe,4,Fri Jul 17 12:28:56 2015 UTC,"My biased opinion is yes, get the game. My unbiased opinion is yes, get the game."
telltale,3dl7e0,kslatin,3,Fri Jul 17 15:31:13 2015 UTC,Hell yes!
telltale,3dl7e0,saucypanther,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:16 2015 UTC,Yes! It looks absolutely beautiful on the Xbox One. Not to mention the fantastic story line.

telltale,3dj2fm,TeddyPickNPin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:16 2015 UTC,I haven't even played episode 4 yet :(
telltale,3dj2fm,wolfej4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:07:21 2015 UTC,I finished it. If you want to know anything that happens then ask.
telltale,3dj2fm,liquidblue4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:47:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely out on Xbox One. I have it as well. I'm finishing up the Walking Dead season 1, then I will go play Nest of Vipers."
telltale,3dj2fm,hawngkawngfooey,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:15 2015 UTC,How about TFTB episode 4?
telltale,3deaop,youngflash,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:28:00 2015 UTC,Is it a DRM free copy similar to the one on the telltale game store?
telltale,3deaop,anagnost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:30:49 2015 UTC,Yes. It'll be a code you have to redeem on the TellTale store
telltale,3deaop,MoistBlankey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:43:11 2015 UTC,"Also, it's 50% off on GOG which ends up being cheaper than GMG and is also DRM free."
telltale,3dcmn6,hjwoolwine,4,Wed Jul 15 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"Got the first episode, didn't like it. Art style, music, characters were all uninteresting to me.  Might just be because Borderlands is exponentially better to me and this can't compare to it, or the fact that as a show watcher, I already know the future."
telltale,3dcmn6,Moorepork,2,Wed Jul 15 20:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'm really liking this one, like I said I've  only played the the TWD season one and two and I feel like those ones are more based on survival and making decisions to stay alive. I got the feeling from this one that it was more about manipulation for personal gain. I liked that. But I agree with you, the characters seemed a little flat. I was instantly drawn into lee and clem, Kenny, duck, kat, but these characters felt stale at first. As I played it and got to experience it from different characters points of view I really liked it. It seems like with this game your choices could influence the bigger picture and not as much the day to day survival as seen on the walking dead. But with telltale games your choices kind of revolve around a specific outlined story and you just get to control the ebb and flow but reach the same destination....all that being said I only played the first episode and I plan to pick up the season pass"
telltale,3dcmn6,svipy,-3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""its free"" ??? Personally I think GoT is weakest of all Telltale games (past WD Telltale games). Loved The Wolf Among Us and currently I am really hooked on Tales from the Borderlands."
telltale,3dcmn6,_pm-me_your-smile_,3,Wed Jul 15 08:31:21 2015 UTC,Free on Xbox live
telltale,3dcmn6,svipy,2,Wed Jul 15 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""its free""   Yeah, that was confusing. The phrase ""It's free"" could mean so many different things.  /s"
telltale,3d5bnl,MahvelIsKill,11,Mon Jul 13 17:21:31 2015 UTC,nest of vipers... holy shit I hope we'll see oberyn! :D

telltale,3d5bnl,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:31:32 2015 UTC,And so my watch begins
telltale,3d5bnl,4rkless,-6,Wed Jul 15 00:34:10 2015 UTC,I did not expect them to pump this out so fast. They usually take centuries to deliver a GOT episode
telltale,3d5bnl,Edadinasni,16,Mon Jul 13 17:32:23 2015 UTC,You srs? Game of Thrones has been the most consistent TT game (in terms of releasing episodes) ever.
telltale,3d5bnl,MoistBlankey,15,Mon Jul 13 18:34:52 2015 UTC,TFTB would kindly ask you to step down.
telltale,3d5bnl,SyriSolord,5,Mon Jul 13 21:26:59 2015 UTC,It's been about two months which is normal for the GOT game isn't it?  Calling it! Probably we'll get the trailer this Thursday and the game next week.
telltale,3d5bnl,populusqueromanus,2,Mon Jul 13 18:31:52 2015 UTC,Next week might be pushing it.  I'm predicting July 28.
telltale,3d5bnl,tehvolcanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:41 2015 UTC,I'm an optimist. It usually drops the week after the trailer does though IIRC.
telltale,3d5bnl,populusqueromanus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:17:35 2015 UTC,WOOOO called it
telltale,3d5bnl,populusqueromanus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:54:57 2015 UTC,GoT is super consistent and steady. TftB on the other hand... If I have to wait until October to get episode 4 I'm gonna be sad.
telltale,3d0fnk,4rkless,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:26:12 2015 UTC,This is too cool. Matching the voices with the faces of the actors is always such an awesome thing to experience.
