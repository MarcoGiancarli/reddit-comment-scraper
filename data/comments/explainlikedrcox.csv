Look, just because the patient on the second floor hits you with a question about binary search trees doesn't mean you have to get your panties in a knot and come crying to me. If he thinks the only way to feel good about himself is to quiz people who study medicine about things he studies in computers, he really has his own issues.  But since he just made Barbie cry her way into the supplies closet and lock the door about an hour ago, I'm a doctor short and I'll tell you how to solve this appropriately:  Java is for wusses who can't handle their shit. If they prefer automatic pointer handling and garbage collection, then of course they can use Java! It doesn't matter if the software stops for 45 milliseconds to dump its memory, the latency of which would make a grown man cry into his Android phone.  No, really, C++ is a man's programming language. It has the features of an Object-Oriented language but the ability to manage its own memory if it has to. That, and the average command in Java has an equivalent command in C++ that's at least 50% faster and optimized for every processor on the planet. It may not look pretty, but it will get the job done for you if you know how to write it.  And don't give me any of that crap about the Java Runtime Environment. Build a makefile or project builder using your favorite interface (XCode, GCC, Microsoft Visual Studio, whatever) and go to town building the game for whatever platform you need. Don't like the fact that batteries aren't included? Go onto the internet and download whatever graphics, audio, web development, or any other library you need. And it will work, faster than Java could do it.  If you're making a program to do relatively simple stuff like counting from 1 to 10, handling web queries, or making a fun experiment in college, then yeah I'd go with Java. But if you want to program with the big boys, you use C++.  Please take a picture of the patient after you tell him this, because I need something to put on my wall in the office. It'll be fine, Abella, it's not like a little crying will hurt his recovery.  ::grabs the test results from next to his door::  looks at the second sheet  guitar chords play  Well goddammit, newbie.

Not because of the pain but because no matter what pain we feel, we can always overcome it. Sure there's physical pain, like your patient's. Although, if I suffered that much pain when I was fifteen, I know I'd never forgive whatever creator put me on this planet. But there's also that ethereal, soul-crushing, can't see the light at the end of the tunnel pain. And even if you feel that pain, by persevering through it, you become stronger. I'm proud of you, John. That may be the scotch talking but it doesn't make it any less true. You experienced awful things this week. Both at the hospital and with your family. But you're still here. Sitting on the couch with someone who wishes he had half the strength that you had. I always gave into my pain and it only gave me more pain, but you know what healed me? Someone like you who not only eases the burden, but shoulders it too. I'll always be grateful for that."

explainlikedrcox,3bg2l0,Sgeo,37,Sun Jun 28 22:26:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Britney, here's the thing: in computer science it's re-he-heally hard - impossible, in fact - to know whether any given computer program will stop (halt) or run forever - but you were too busy worrying about whether your push-up bra was really making those tiny nub-nubs pop to pay attention in com sci class, weren't you?  Now here's the thing: let's say we've got ourselves a magical little program called 'P' that can tell us whether any program will halt on a given input - sort of like that time you pretended the girls at prom weren't laughing at your awkward hairdo, we'll imagine it even though we both know it's not true. Now that we've got P, let's write a new program called Q: Q takes in as input (with me so far, Barbie?) some new program and tells us what P would tell us about the behaviour of the input program run with itself as input: for a sample program X, Q=P(X run with 'X' as input).  Finally, Janice, we're going to use Q to make a new program called R: if Q tells us that X halts on X, R loops forever; if Q tells us that X doesn't halt on input X, then R halts. Now we have R look at a copy of itself (sort of like when you look in the mirror in the morning and try to hide all those zits that we both know are still showing): if R would halt on input R, then R loops forever [see last sentence]; otherwise, if R would loop forever given itself as input, then it halts.  So now, Alicia, we've got ourselves a handy-dandy contradiction: if we imagine a program P that solves the Halting Problem, we'll end up with a contradiction: R halts when it loops and loops when it halts. Since we can't have a contradiction, we know 'P' can't actually exist, so we can't ever write a program that will tell us whether a given program will halt on a given input.  Got all that, Mary?  Edit: had the conditions in R backwards"

But here's the skinny, Judie, there is no mommy duckling. There's no daddy duckling either. Because we're alone. There's only one meeting for 'my wife destroys my life' and that's the bar after work with a prescription for a bottle of scotch.

I'm talking about acres and acres of server stacks and just in case the blood supply is completely cut off from that neck-top melon of yours, a server is a computer that uses something called Raid (no not the bug spray) that keeps and compares copies of whatever it is storing. You then put the video of Gandhi's drunken copulation with that stuffed dog into an interface on your computer and that interface sends (because you've never even seen a command line and giggle far too much at the word ping) your video off to these servers. Here's the really cool part, for the sake of space saving, general organization, redundancy and the fact quite a bit of our stuff is similar to other stuff people have stored, your video is normally broken into smaller pieces and copies of those pieces are kept on different servers potentially in different server farms. Oh wait, I see you've fallen asleep. <loud whistle> The cloud is where your stuff is broken into pieces and kept on different farms using bug spray. Or in other words Vanessa, magic.

As founder and leader of the mainstream Mouvement national congolais (MNC) party, Lumumba played an important role in campaigning for independence from Belgium.  Within twelve weeks of Congolese independence in 1960, Lumumba's government was deposed in a coup during the Congo Crisis following his attempt to solicit support from the Soviet Union against Katangan secessionists. This led to growing differences with President Joseph Kasa-Vubu and chief-of-staff Joseph-Désiré Mobutu as well as foreign opposition from the United States and Belgium. Lumumba was subsequently imprisoned by state authorities under Mobutu and executed by firing squad under the command of the Katangan authorities. The United Nations, which he had asked to come to the Congo, did not intervene to save him. Belgium, the United States, and the United Kingdom have all been accused of involvement in Lumumba's death.

Drawing on this great force, which we'll call... hmmm... the Annoying Force, gives people like you the power to drive people like me absolutely nuts.   Now, some people, through an accident of god or just sheer darn force a will, surpass the traditional human capability for being annoying. These people don't just tap into the Annoying Force, they channel it; they become a part of the Annoying Force. This becomes a symbiotic relationship: neither can exist without the other.  And this, Cheryl, is what ultimately stops me from killing you every single day; the thought that I would throw the very fabric of our universe out of whack if I were to remove such a huge part of the Annoying Force from reality.

The stack in Magic works just like the stack of teenbop magazines you hide in your desk drawer.  When you put this months issue in there, it goes on top of the others.  If you wanna go back to three months ago, you have to take out that one, and whatever else is on top first.  Now of course you being you, you are going to look at each one as you take it out, that's ""resolving"" each item on the stack.  Unlike you though, the game isn't gonna get distracted by a ""which Hannah Montana character are you"" quiz and it will keep plopping the things off the stack until it's done.  I mean seriously Newbie, this is so fundamental to Magic that even newbies understand it.

Is a turtle about to be released from the talons of a passing eagle, which has mistaken my head for a rock covered in gorgeous moss, striking me dead? Oh, Cindy, I wish it would. I really wish it would. But you're lucky, because just owing to my pity of your incalculable dunderheadedness, and to prove to you that I am in all ways your intellectual superior--a great peak of genius that can never be scaled in your female ant lifetime--I'm going to answer your stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid question.

That's someone who believes in Nihilism--is a person so devoid of any little eensie-weensie, teeny-tiny spec of testicular, or in your case ovarian, fortitude that they use the cop-out of ""what does anything matter, anyway?"" to explain and justify everything in life. For instance, BAP, a Nihilist would say it was neither wrong nor right for me to punch you in the face just now. Did it hurt? Yes, my advanced medical training assures me your pain receptors are firing on all cylinders, resisting the urge to cry out for mommy with your every fiber. It's okay, go ahead. Or don't. Nihilists don't think anything matters. Do you think it matters if I hit you some more, Judith? Wrong. Nihilism says it doesn't. I can just go steal one of the janitor's precious mop heads, attach it to my face, declare myself Space Santa, and launch myself ho'ho'ho-ingly right off the top of this building right now, and it won't mean a thing. Which, in fact, is exactly what most Nihilists end up doing with their lives, if they don't die of a myocardial infarction from sitting on the couch all day, sobbing into a soggy box of General Clucker's Extra Spicy Chicken.  In summary, since it's certain this summary is all your Fisher Price My First Brain is likely to retain: it's almost, if this were even possible, as crippled and useless a philosophy as you are an excuse for someone who pretends they're a female medical professional.

The problems of American educational system begin where many problems in the US begin, with our government. Now I'm not here blaming right wing or left wing or even the west wing even though i know a gal like you has got to love her some Martin Sheen despite the crippling age difference. But Janice as I said our educational problems stem from politicians and bureaucrats who spent 12-14 years in a school so they then think they know everything they could possibly know about how schools should run. But I'll let you in on a little secret, it takes more than a high-school diploma to determine nationwide education policy. So what happens is that there are a lot of federal and state mandates without any funding to coincide with what the schools are now required to do. The best example is the new PARCC tests. Although they are required by the government to be taken at all levels of school these tests are not paid funded directly by the people mandating the test. Now Denise as a side note I have said the word mandate twice now and I know when I said it that wondering mind of yours drifted off to a night filled with candle light and bald surgeons. But this isn't the dinner and a movie kind of man-date this is a requirement set down by our friends at the state house.  So to continue my previous example these PARCC tests are paid for by the individual schools who's shoestring budgets are a lot like the budget of this hospital. Now imagine instead of Bob Kelso cutting back the free clinic he had to cut back art PE and music. And Lisa just when you think it got bad just wait there's more. Because speaking of tests these kids get plenty of them. Because those oh so knowledgable politicians we talked about earlier want schools and teachers to be more and more accountable to them they had to find a way to make sure they can see how affective the schools are. This is what led us to the 6 weeks of testing that my son is taking in the third grade. Now just to make sure you understand this I'm not talking about tests used by the teacher to have an input on their learning and their grade, I'm talking about the periphery of tests that will be given then never seen by the teacher or school my son goes to.  No these things are shipped away to some grading center in Idaho to be graded by little old ladies and college dropouts who are apparently living their dream of telling kids they aren't good enough. Unfortunately these tests are robbing our kids of their education and putting so much pressure on teachers that all that is taught is the test. And if you wanna know the gods honest truth newbie, I worry for our kids."

You want to be told that Scrubs is flatlining because Netflix signs contracts with networks, and that it is actually the networks that are pulling the content. You want to hear that NBC is planning to have the old episodes on their own streaming platform in an attempt to stay relevant. Well rest assured that this simply isn't true.  After consulting with the good people of Netflix, they have assured me that the real reason is that they hate you. Duh-heee-eeeere god they hate you. And can you really blame them? The way you stare off thinking about how much you want Gandhi to hold you, that smug little laugh of yours... It's a miracle you are still here to complain about this, and that you haven't been removed from this Earth in the most justifiable murder suicide.   My point is Margaret, either Netflix weighed how much demand there was for the show to stay in their streaming service and decided it wasn't worth it, or they just really really hate you. I know which I think is more likely, and I think you don't have to dig too deep into your self-loathing to find the answer either."

I spent a good part of my residency at North Central Baptist and dated a geology grad student out at UTSA. Between margarita soaked runs to Taco Cabana, she taught me a little about that corner of the world.  South Texas used to be under the ocean millions of years ago. That sediment filled up with shells and fossilized. So under all those scrubby little Christmas trees they call cedars is the only thing that grows more plentiful in that part of the country, rocks. Rocks as big as your pumpkin head, as big as that stuffed dog, that motorized European bicycle of yours and some even as big as my child support payments to she who will remain nameless. Despite being a mecca for desperate un-documented workers, the amount of tamales it would take to have a piece of earth cleared makes unrealistic. While the bigger construction companies have the equipment to excavate a basement, those aren’t the companies that build houses. That good work is done by the aforementioned undocumented workers because paying people to do a job well in that area is inversely proportional to the amount of rocks in the ground."

explainlikedrcox,2qxkru,winssloow,4,Wed Jan 7 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"Alright kitten, here's your answer.  In the south we have a few conditions that preclude us from the added expenses or necessity of having a basement: * Frost lines are higher or nonexistent: since foundations must go below the frost line in order to avoid freezing pipes and other structural issues, it's an unnecessary expense for most homeowners. This should make you happy because now you can spend the money you would have otherwise spent for environmental reasons on expanding your Liberace costume collection. * Loose soil, limestone, other porous material: much of the south was covered up in salt water at some point in time in the same way you spend your Saturday nights covering yourself in Cheeto dust while ""hangin with your WoW clan"". Much of the soil is sediment that hasn't had the benefit of spending several million years being compacted like your bowels after one of your world-famous 80 buffalo wing feast-o-ramas and is otherwise the result of the chemical - let me say that slower: kem-eh-cull - reactions that create such sedimentary rock.   If your piddly little brain doesn't understand these concepts look at it like this: northern states need to stay away from the cold and can dig into the ground where you should be sticking your head because you ask such stupid questions, and southern states, like my brilliance, can shine on for the world to see."

Secondly, and I cannot, repeat, cannot tell you strongly enough - stay away from the pharmacy - you don't belong there and the drugs just don't do your brain cell any good.  Now, for most of Texas, they have this stuff called dirt that they build on, not down into.  They also have something in the ground called ""water"" and it sits in what they call a ""water table"".  You could, almost, say that the water takes up space in the soil where the soil just isn't.  Yeah, just like your little training diaper is most of the time.  Now that water sits high in the ground and soil, just like your diaper, still.  That water would, in fact, be Hell to keep out of your basement even if you installed a sump pump.  You see, Lorraine, that pump would have to work harder than you ever have ever combined in your IN-TIRE but completely meaningless life order to keep that basement dry and empty, much like your oversized head with your oversized hair.  But lastly, that place, you know, South Texas, has land that is so cheap, people can build side to side much easier than they can up and down.  They don't have to build tall, they build out.  Sometimes it amazes me that they do it, but then again, you decided to be a doctor, if you can call it that, and so I guess, what the Hell, they can decide to do what they want anyway.

explainlikedrcox,2qvk44,HankSpank,219,Wed Dec 31 01:54:33 2014 UTC,"This will be difficult for you to understand, princess, so pay close attention. You probably don't know what a group is, so let's start there. A group is a set along with an operation combining two members of that set. For example, the set ℤ of integers (you at least know what a integer is, right?) along with the addition operation + forms a group. I'm sure you think that's all there is to a group, but you're wrong. The operation on the group needs to follow some additional laws:   it must be associative, so that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c); there must be an identity element 0 such that 0 + a = a + 0 = a; and every element a must have an inverse -a satisfying a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0.   That will be a lot for you to wrap your head around, so come back when you figure it out.  The next thing you need to understand is the definition of a field. It's a simple concept, but I'll try to dumb it down a bit. A field is a set with two associative operations, + and *. The following laws apply:   The set along with the + operation forms a commutative group (I didn't define what I mean by commutative, but everyone learns that in middle school). The set (sans its additive identity) along with the * operation forms a commutative group. Multiplication distributes over addition: a(b+c)=ab+ac and (a+b)c=ac+bc.   This is probably too abstract for you to understand, so I'll give you an example: the real numbers ℝ and the operations + and *.  The most important thing for a newbie like you to understand is this: Galois theory is all about the relation between groups and fields. The first thing you need to understand is the definition of a K-automorphism. If F is an extension field of K (for the less gifted readers, that means F is a field that contains the field K), then a K-automorphism is a bijective field homomorphism f : F → F such that f(k) = k for all k in K. Oh, you don't know what a homomorphism is? I figured a newbie like you wouldn't. A field homomorphism is a function f : F → F where f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b) and f(ab)=f(a)f(b). It's called bijective if it pairs every element of its codomain (in this case, F) with a unique element of its domain (in this case, F again).  Now that you finally understand what a K-automorphism is, we can define the Galois group of a field extension. Again, let F be a field extension of K. Then the Galois group of F over K, denoted Aut(F/K), is the set of all K-automorphisms F → F, where the operation is function composition.  And now for the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. This theorem explicitly gives a one-to-one correspondence between the intermediate fields of a field extension (the fields contained in F which contain K) and the subgroups of the Galois group Aut(F/K):   The subgroup H of Aut(F/K) corresponds to the set of elements of F which are fixed by every K-automorphism in H. To spell if out for you, that's the set { x ϵ F : f(x) = x for all f ϵ H }. The intermediate field E (contained in F and containing K) corresponds to the group Aut(F/E).   While the proof is trivial, someone like you wouldn't be able to understand it. I'll omit it for your sake.  Congratulations, now you understand the very basics of algebra."

For anyone who doesn't know what closure is, it means that for any two elements (a and b) in your group, if you perform the group's binary operation on them (a+b), the new element, c, that comes out (say a+b=c) is also still in your original set."

explainlikedrcox,2qwtbc,makdesi,16,Wed Dec 31 11:02:35 2014 UTC,"Well you see, Marie, in order to even answer this question, you should probably define what it means to be strong, and what the potential stronger candidates are to compare to Arceus himself. (Some OR/AS spoilers ahead--you have been warned, Marie).  Since you have failed to do so (not smart, Marie! You should always think things through!!!), I will do some of the leg work for you and try and answer this as thoroughly as possible.  If you define strength as a statistical measure, say, a massive attack stat thanks to mega evolution, then of course there are  candidates that are ""stronger"" than Arceus. For example, Mega Rayquaza is an example of a ""stronger"" Pokemon, as its base Attack and Sp. Attack are larger than Arceus'. However, in order for Mega Rayquaza to be considered, you need to ask yourself if the Arceus you speak of exists within the events that occurred within the timeline of Pokemon X/Y/OR/AS. If it did, then the Mega Rayquaza is stronger simply because Mega Evolution allows it to be stronger. However, if you refer to the Arceus that exists in every other Pokemon game prior to X/Y/OR/AS, then Arceus is statistically the strongest Pokemon based on base statistics. Shame on you for thinking otherwise, Marie.  If you define strength based on abilities and raw power, then you fail to realize that Arceus, in and of itself, limits its power in the ""real world"". The Pokedex and ancient scriptures describe Arceus as having 1000 arms, yet pictures and real life accounts of Arceus depict him as having four legs. The lack of arms only legitimizes the fact that the real world, Arceus' creation, cannot even handle the amount of hidden power that Arceus has. You should know this, Marie. Come on, now.  If you define strength based on weaknesses, it's probably easy to assume that Arceus has many, since he can change his type depending on what plate he is holding. Yet, when he changes his plates, and his type, his resistances change as well. Since he has access to the greatest amount of resistances, he is technically the strongest Pokemon as he has the greatest amount of possible resistances of any Pokemon, beating out the likes of Spiritomb and Sableye (both of which are weak to fairy type) and cannot change their typings to resist the fairy type.  I have wasted too much time with this, Marie. Go back to reorganizing my mineral collection."

I really hate to break it to you, but the Übermensch isn't just some big hunky boytoy for you and the girls to giggle about. He's the solution to this mighty fine mess you, your boyfriend Kent, and all the other Last Men have created on this lil' blue ball of ours. You see noobie, Kent’s as square and boring as a Plymouth Acclaim and his square boring life is why life sucks. The Übermensch is going to save the world from sucking and amoral psychopaths like Kelso by teaching the human race the power of true love. Now doesn't that just pull at your heart strings?   Now sister, I know you’re thinking, “But isn’t the Übermensch the very best-est and strongest and most handsome-ist man ever?” NO.

However, you must have missed the point when you were reading whatever Wikipedia or Buzzfeed article about it. You see the Judeo-Christian system of morals is dead, and we are simply not satisfied to believe the universe doesn't give a daaaamn about us. The Übermensch represents the next step in mankind towards not only accepting their suffering and life but loving them.

explainlikedrcox,2mt7c3,FoxyBrownMcCloud,1 point,Thu Nov 20 18:57:11 2014 UTC,"Not really true at all. If it's your first playthrough, you're probably using your starter as a crutch and you only really half-know how all the type advantages work.   Bulbasaur first encounters a weakness on the 5th (or 6th) gym leader, Sabrina, so by that point, you either have had plenty of time to pick up some Dark or Ghost type Pokemon/moves or your Venusaur is so ridiculously overleveled it doesn't matter.   Squirtle first encounters a weakness at the 3rd gym leader, Lt. Surge, and at this point, if you're overleveling your Wartortle/Blastoise you may or may not have trouble, especially considering you're probably raising a Pidgeotto or a Butterfree or something as your second best Poke. But at the absolute worst, Surge has a Diglett cave in his backyard.  Charmander has it rough though. In the old games Brock didn't have any Rock moves, so it wasn't a big deal, but in FR/LG, Onix has Rock Tomb which rips through most of your more obvious team options at this point in the game (Butterfree, Beedrill, Pidgey, etc.) and he'll be resistant to several others. If you powerlevel Charmander, Onix's pathetic special defense still gets beaten by Ember, or Butterfree's Confusion or if you play a little smarter you can pick up a Nidoran with double kick or a Mankey. Misty's even more of a bitch if your Charmeleon is too overleveled at this point, but you can always grab an Oddish/Belsprout one route over Or a Beedrill with Twinneedle will get the job done against Starmie as well.  Overall, Pokemon's just not a hard game, but Charmander has the worst illusion of difficulty because he doesn't have advantage over Brock and if you don't take the time to explore the game, you'll probably miss Nidoran and Mankey or you may just not like them. But after Misty, the world is so open that there're really not any excuse to even need your starter against any gym leader."

(After 3rd gym you should have at least 4 pokemon to support your starter)   1st gym is rock/ground. Bulbasaur and Squirtle are super effective against these types. Charmander is not only weak against rock/ground but all of his attacks (scratch, ember etc) are not very effective against rock/ground.  2nd gym is water. Bulbasaur is super effective against water. Squirtle is water and water against water is not very effective only normal attacks do regular dammage. Charmander again is weak against this gym. Only normal attacks do regular damage.   3rd gym is electric. Its not very effective against Bulbasaur. It's super effective against Squirtle. It's normal against Charmander.  Advantages for Baulbasaur: SE against 2. 3 gyms not very effective against him.  Advantages for Squirtle: SE against 1. 2 Gyms not very effective against him.

If we want to actually play a game rather than letting one hold our hand, though, you speedrun using Squirtle. Beam/Blizzard/Surf/Fissure + X Accuracy gets you through damn fast.

A dependent is like you and I, if beyond answering your inane questions, wiping your butt after you go poopie and keeping you from running into the road, legally I was financially responsible for you.  Allowances change the amount of tax you pay, more allowances for more dependents and other things. Sadly though it doesn't mean dependents are even vaguely profitable. My bubbling bundle of baby boy helped me to the tune of six-hundred bucks this year, which is not quite the cost of a month of diapers. Luckily the she-beast breast feeds; the disheveled scattering of used breast pads and vaguely cheese aroma of my apartment saves us the car payment on a Porsche in formula. Now where was I? Oh yes, withholdings.  Withholdings is the amount of money taken from your paycheck based on what you probably will pay in taxes that year. You can have less withheld because you want more candy and movie money each week or more withheld because you like the government to gain interest on your money and want to have a big check come back in April for an American Girl shopping spree. Yay!  Deductions are money that you pay out; sometimes for business expenses, sometimes to charities and for various reasons this lowers the amount of taxes you pay. A W2 is the form your employer uses to tell the government how much money you make and a W4 is where they report your allowances. A 1040 is where it all comes together once a year, but you should stick to the 1040EZ because you don't want to ruin your mascara and give yourself crows feet over a nasty old complicated government form."

Now to find the information you actually require you should go to the library, you know that big building on your college campus filled with books that you always meant to visit until your boyfriend talked you into going to a drive-in where you saw the aforementioned terrible movies.  If you feel courageous enough you can try the Internet but that would require you to move out of your current interests in writing fiction about your life in search of validation from complete strangers.  Now get to Mr. Hopkins in Room 12 before he dies and I'm forced to take over your patients when you go search for Greek mythology.  Turns away for a second before turning around  Oh and Cynthia if I ever discover that you have written fiction involving me I will destroy it, tracking down every copy to destroy while I give the Janitor everything he needs to destroy your life through fiction.  Now you may be asking, why give the Janitor the information?  Well that's for two reeaaaallllllyyyyy simple reasons, the Janitor is just insane enough to not care about the consequences and frankly, there's no way for you to ruin the Janitor's name which no one actually knows in order to discredit the fiction and regain the people who you considered to be your fans."

explainlikedrcox,2k4ych,crawlerz2468,24,Fri Oct 24 00:38:20 2014 UTC,"Alight, Cheryl, listen up because I'm only going to indulge your need for story time this once.  Back when you were but a glimmer in your mommy's eye our nation faced threats that you cannot possibly conceive; an enigmatic, nuclear enemy that we didn't understand - kind of like you and medicine.  This was the Soviet Union; and much like nurse gabs-a-lot over there, the USSR had a whole bunch of friends who liked the US about as much I like my ex-wife.  Just like my marriage, we kept a paranoid distance from each other for our own good.  But like your bromance with Chocolate Love over there, we were curious and wanted to know what the cold bitch was up to.  So a guy named Kelly Johnson started to design a plane to shine a light into one of the deepest, darkest places in the world - well, second darkest, after my ex-wife's heart.    But here's the thing you don't get, kiddo; this was a major gamble on a plane that would fly on the edge of space, at over three times the speed of sound, into the most defended airspace the world had ever seen - and it was designed with a slide rule.  Not one computer model, not one calculator was used to make this titanium sled that was to challenge god himself with physics and the planet as a game board.  It was built out of titanium, which today you wear as a fashion accessory, but back then we bought the stuff from Russia through CIA front companies.  Men risked their lives to get the raw materials to the US so we could make it into a plane that we would fly into Soviet airspace to photograph them.  Probably not as big a risk as being your patient, but still a risk.  Nothing could fly as high or as fast.   Missiles ran out of fuel and fell back to earth trying to shoot it down, lesser planes had engines stall trying to climb as high, and we flew it over our enemies during their formal functions just because the sound of it passing would remind them that we are watching.   And just like the SR-71, I'm always watching you, right now I better watch you scurry over and do something resembling medicine for Mrs. Reynolds and try not to think about the fact that her IV drip contains more computing power than the entire division that built the SR-71 and you can't even notice that her bag needs to be replaced.

Now these all clumped together and formed the Solar system as we know it. why did this happen in a fairly flat pattern you ask? well the sun rotates.  So here is a little science experiment: Take a tennis ball, dunk it in water and then spin it reheeheeheally fast and watch how the water spreads from the ball. Congratulations you jsut learned science instead of learning something useful like how to do your job and not kill someone.

And when you do... I'll be right there to pounce on you with the real answer.

Pan to Turk stuffing his face with a donut, who looks up and waves with a smile behind his full cake hole  ugh, now, this primordial collection of junk had a certain average angular momentum, there was an average direction which stuff was spinning in. Now as all this crap started to clump together, kinda like you and Barbie always seem to wind up connected at the hip, that angular momentum didn't go away. So now eeeeeverything in the solar system has collected in a bunch of these little balls which are all spinning around just like that original nebula was, and just like the figure skaters you just love to watch on your Sunday nights.

This question is just foolish enough that I won't even tolerate it with a response, instead I will seal it in my mind behind a barrier of hatred just like any positive opinions I involuntarily acquired about Hugh Jackman where it will remain forever.  Now give me your chart since you just proved you are incapable of treating your patients I will keep them alive but make sure that they know I saved them so you don't get any accidental credit to keep your fake medical profession alive.  Now you may be asking what do I do now that Dr. Cox has taken all my patients, my answer is to go home, take some of Barbie's textbooks because we both know she still has them and learn what you should already know about ebola.  Begins to walk away, then turns around And no Tamera you do not have ebola otherwise I would have the Janitor lock you in a morgue drawer with your only human contact being the aforementioned janitor bringing what I deem necessary to you.  Also if by some horrible miracle you get ebola and give it to me, I will haunt you to the end of time by sheer force of will regardless of if you die or survive."

Just like every other celebrity that came before him, Unidan grew accustomed to seeing his posts succeed. To ensure he'd continue reaping in fake internet points, he made multiple accounts to upvote his own submissions, just like, you guess it, a jackass. Now, the jackasses over at Reddit caught wind of it and permanently banned him for being the jackass that he is. And to top it all of, Charlotte, he tried to justify it. He said the posts would've been successful by themselves, but he chose to upvote them so more people would see his posts and gain knowledge.  Any of this ringing a bell?

Luckily for you however Margaret, some wonderful people who, for whatever reason, seem to care about your future as a doctor, or more likely the future of the patients who will have the extre-hehe-mly unfortunate luck of having you as their caretaker, have developed a way in which people who actually give a damn about medicine enough to learn it properly can dumb it down and explain it in such a way that a five year old, and hopefully you as well, would be able to understand, on atleast a basic level, what the hell is actually going on.

I see why you do that so often.  (whistles to cut JD off as he starts to gush about daydreams)  Listen here Barbra.

That's what you've got. Sure they'll spice it up by throwing two of those kind of plots in together the same way as janitor over there makes inventions, but in the end, it's the same old tale in a slightly less embarrassing format than your game nights, which I again will stress I am noooot coming to no matter how many times you ask.

I call you girls names and Newbie because frankly I do think that there needs to be some time between each name if for the sole reason that they remain in your mind longer so that you would maaaaaaayyybe forget your real name and go by whatever name you picked; and if that actually happened I would track down everyone who has ever had contact with you just to make sure that no one ever used your real name again.  But back to my point: I call you girls names for the several reasons, one being that since your arrival in this dump you chose me to flee to whenever you needed the slightest bit of advice or help, which is in clear objection to the few rules that all men live by.  That rule you continually violate is that when most men require help they do not lose their dignity while they find whom they trust most to ask, and I know what you're thinking Newbie but what again I am the exception to this rule.  The other two reasons are your all-but in name marriage to Gandhi over there who I'm sure is just waiting for both of you to be off-shift so you can eat ice cream right out of the container while you gossip and how in the several years I have had the displeasure of knowing you that the amount of activities  qualified as manly that I know you actually have done can be counted on Rex's Four-fingered hand.
