CafeRacers,3dz15f,KungLa0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:54 2015 UTC,I know all about the time thing.  It really kind of pissed me off to know that I put the bike completely back together in about 8 hours.  But it took me 4 months to find 8 hours. haha.  I did a little rewiring myself 2 winters ago.  Basically completely revamped the stock wiring harness and eliminated everything that was not necessary.
CafeRacers,3dz15f,MotherOfPus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:33 2015 UTC,So I know basically nothing about wiring.  I'd like to have the area where the battery goes to be open but I have no idea what to do with the electronics/battery that currently reside there.  Are you kick only and don't have a battery now?
CafeRacers,3dz15f,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"I am currently 'kick only' because my solenoid is bad.  I pulled some of the starter wiring off, but I am still using the battery for ignition purposes.  I'm not sure you can simply eliminate the battery without upgrading the charging system.  With the stock system you still need some sort of capacitor in the line (battery) for everything to regulate correctly.  The battery powers the lights and to my knowledge keeps you spark hot enough to run the engine.  Once your battery dies, so does your bike. I speak from experience, I had a short in my charging wiring last summer (broken solder joint) and I could ride maybe 15 minutes before the bike would die on a full charge.  Hugh's Handbuilt has the best charging system on the market for these old XS650s.  I believe these systems are compatible with a battery-less set up.  There are a ton of good forums about this topic."
CafeRacers,3dz15f,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Nice build man, just did the same thing with the revamped stock wiring harness on my XS. What did you eliminate from the harness besides the electric start? Thinking about doing the same thing, already ditched a few wires that were unnecessary.   Also, any tips on polishing the side covers? Mine are looking a little rough."
CafeRacers,3e1c5g,graulas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:17 2015 UTC,"Could be fuel. Could be valve timing or ignition timing (I think these yamahas have some sort of electronic ignition board though, so you might not be able to set ignition timing with it).   Could have a bad ring or bad valve seat.   If you're getting spark, but the timing is off, it won't do a thing.   It's a single, this should be easy."

Not to mention you're talking about a California market, where everything seems inflated.   Having said that, if that's what you really like and want, it's worth it if you like it. He listed obo, so start low and see what he will haggle. (In person would probably be best, with cash in hand. You have more leverage then instead over the phone or whatever)  Personally I wouldn't spend 1500 on such a small bike. But that's me.

CafeRacers,3dyfn6,cafeallday850,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:53 2015 UTC,Great job!  I have a question about the tyres.  I've stuck with the old inch size tyres on my vintage Triumphs because I could never get a good answer on what metric sizes to use - just warnings about tank slappers if you pick the wrong size/pressure and the world will come to an end if you depart from the original.  So I'm curious what sizes you selected and how you determined what pressures to run. Did you base your decision on anything or is this your first go at it and you're exploring as you go?
CafeRacers,3dyfn6,ser_sheep_shagger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:27 2015 UTC,"I've never heard any such warning about tire sizes on these bike, and I have talked to a few old timers who know a lot more than I. I went with Conti Classic Attack tires but I also changed a few things about this bike.... nothing is stock. The stock rims are 18"" WM3 in the back and a 19"" WM2 in the front, I ditched the heavy steel rims for aluminum Excels and went with 18"" front and rear as well as up to WM4 in rear and WM3 in front. I selected tire sizes based on some comparisons to other bikes, some reading on geometry and personal preference. As for pressures, not sure yet. The aren't dialed in and I haven't ridden it so that is TBD.  Once it's on the road I can report back with how it handles!"

CafeRacers,3dyjz5,nasaldecongestant,5,Mon Jul 20 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's been a test of my hard-headness. I have them pretty well tuned in for an open header and cb900 cam. I've done the Honda RSC mod, shimmed the needles and ran them with about 6 different jet combos. Currently they are, 2 outer carbs 125/80, 2 inner are 120/80 on the jets. All of them are shimmed with one washer each. I'm eventually going to break down and get a set of FCR's or flat slides. But honestly, you can make CV's run well with pods. Everyone will down vote this and tell me I'm lying, but I've been running these cv's for 2 years now. There is no flat spots, it pulls clean and hard to 10k, and starts and idles perfectly. There is a small segment of people on cb1100f.net that dedicated themselves to getting the most out of CV's and have done a great job. Most of the people who tell you it won't work have never been inside a carb and are only parroting what someone else told them. Honestly though, I will eventually break down and get a set of FCR's or flatslides. I do believe they are  the best way to make the most HP easily."

CafeRacers,3dzf4z,sttaffy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:30 2015 UTC,"I tried a Bullitt on, along with a Shoei RF-1200, a Bell RS-1, and a Biltwell Gringo. Field of vision was totally clear except for the gringo, where it was minimally restricted at the very edges, not too bad.   Compared to the Shoei and the RS-1 the Bullitt seemed super flimsy. I'm sure it protects better than a brain pan, but side by side it felt like too much of a compromise on protection for the sake of style. And on the style, it had more of a lego-man look in real life than online - it was pretty large overall (the RF-1200 was smaller if I remember).   The Gringo is overall more cheaply made, but still OK. Compared to the other three helmets this one was in a class of its own concerning build quality, and not in a good way. Still seemed sturdy, and surprisingly light. The lack of vents was an issue.   RF-1200 didn't fit my skull, too wide. Nice, nice nice though.   The RS-1 fit great and didn't look like a spaceship pilot helmet. I wanted a white helmet for visibility, and it doesn't come in white, so I bought one with ugly ass graphics off of ebay for like $189 (brand new), disassembled, masked, stripped, primed and painted it myself. Looks great on my vintage-esque bike, and I'm the only person I see around with a flat white helmet. With the cost of paint it came out to be almost as cheap as the Gringo with the movable shield, around $210 (half price!!!).   You only get one brain, treat it as good as you possibly can. Limbs can be reconstructed, or even replaced with prostheses, skin can be grafted, bones screwed back together, but once your noodle gets scrambled that's it."

My bike, (as of late) has had what I diagnosed to be carburetor issues, because for the first while of riding, it would be just fine, but then, slowly the low Rpms would get groggier and more sluggish, as soon as I get out of low Rpms it would speed back up and be fine, as time goes on in riding it gets harder to get out of low Rpms, and eventually I can't, and the bike dwindles out and dies. The first time it happened took like 5 minutes, only starting after 20 kms, but now it starts nearly immediately."
CafeRacers,3dvwuh,kowalski71,4,Sun Jul 19 23:50:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a manual I found with some real quick googling. The fuel system includes the basic troubleshooting process for checking that all the little passages are clear, float height, pilot screw adjustment, etc. Go through all that and see if anything is amiss.  I just rebuild a set of 4 of these Keihin CVs for my CB750. They're a pretty simple carb but definitely have their tricks about them. Here's the guide for rebuilding the CB750 bank, which should give you some info on what's going on in there.  If you expect to do any significant work on Japanese motorcycles I highly recommend investing in some JIS screwdrivers. Most people don't know this but 'phillips' is a specific kind of cross head screwdrivers designed to 'cam out' if enough torque is applied (hence having to really push on the screwdriver to prevent this camming action). JIS is designed to put as much torque as you want on them and not cam out. Using Phillips on JIS screws strips and mangles the head, I bet you'll see more than a few wrecked screws on your bike. I have this set of Vessels but this set should be adequate if you want to save a few bucks. It will save you significant headache. Also replace any stripped JIS screws while you're in there, you can get them reasonably cheap from McMaster.  That being said, it sounds like it's a heat dependent issue. Maybe check out the ignition system? One of the components could not like the heat and be failing as it gets warm."

If you want a quick example, we had a customer who was ridding home when his header came off.... he kept ridding, well within about 1 mile his engine blew up. This header is obviously longer than no header... but I'd be impressed if the bike survives 1000 miles."

I'd take side shots and do overlays of how you want it to look and then ""do the math"" to see how to make it work. I think the hardest part would be getting the tank lower and the seat raised due to the front of the frame being so high. Then again, lower the front, raise the rear and go with a larger tire set and you could probably balance it out."

I wasn't sure if I would be able to level it out to pretty much flat by getting shorter stocks and doing something about the back end.  I like the idea of doing overlays. I may be able to find out somewhere the length of those shocks (or work it out myself) and then see what stocks fit and what difference it makes.   I am also not sure how easy it would be to find parts that fit this bike. But that is something research can tell me I am sure."

You're right, the bike was much better looking before and actually quite a bit more comfortable and practical as a motorcycle.  However, you're in luck, because you really don't want this to look good anyhow! When applying that new finish be sure to use a brush. One of those big ones for painting tar onto basement foundations would be perfect. Oh and paint everything you can reach.   I also wouldn't worry about having pod air cleaners. Your bike will run much better without them, and air's pretty clean already.   One thing that would really cleanup or actually in your case look really dumb...which is good I guess, is if you take off the front disk and caliper assembly. We all know it's the back brake that does all the braking anyhow right?   Oh and don't forget the tires designed in the 20's and 30s....you know the ones they still use on 80 year old cars and then decided they would be OK for bikes. Old tech like this can actually make your bike much faster and safer at the same time.   Whatever you do , do not clutter this thing up with a mirror or mirrors, they literally are the kiss of death anyhow. It's been proven that riders with them have such a false sense of security they are lulled to sleep while riding and often plunge off the road or drive head on into cars. Safety first right?

CafeRacers,3df98v,gemini86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:07:37 2015 UTC,"Not quite, but close. Here's a good explanation from this site:   In an ordinary neon lamp, the metal cathode is heated up to a relatively high temperature (sometimes well over 100°C—you can really feel the heat coming off a neon lamp if you stand nearby) so negatively charged electrons ""boil"" off it and race toward the positively charged anode, colliding with gas molecules in the process, exciting them, and making them give off colored light (as we explain fully in our article on neon lamps). In a nixie tube, the cathodes remain relatively cool (tubes like this are described as ""cold cathode,"" even though they're generally on the warm side—about human body temperature) but the gas mixture that surrounds them is at a very low pressure (perhaps 1/100th of normal atmospheric pressure or even less). When a voltage of about 170–180 volts is applied between the anode and one of the cathodes, the low-pressure gas becomes ionized (its atoms or molecules are turned into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons). When the ions and electrons collide with metal atoms ejected from the cathode, we get a glowing, fuzzy ""coating"" of light forming all around the cathode, very close to it, that follows its shape precisely—effectively making it appear as though one of the numbers 0–9 is illuminated. Applying a voltage to a different cathode makes a different digit ""light up."""

Any knowledge or tips about this bike are always appreciated. Cheers.

CafeRacers,3dfxig,weaselchew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:54:08 2015 UTC,"These are fun little bikes; I have a 1964 S90. If you take the tank off and follow the wiring harness inside the frame, there should be a label on the harness with the year printed on it. I'd guess that it's a 1965. It looks to have an aluminum cylinder, offset carb, painted fender (unless it's over top of the chrome) and these are all signs of an older bike. Does the clutch cover separately bolt on to the engine side cover and the muffler separately attach to the exhaust pipe? (instead of being all one piece) these are also signs of older years. There is an S90 yahoo group that has a serial number registry with some known years too, you can get an idea of what year yours is by the serial."

Also, I bought a Clymer manual that covers all the 50cc-110c bikes including the little trail bikes. Though it covers bikes from 65' onward (mine is a Frankenstein 1967) , it only covers 73'-75'... Are the engines pretty much the same? Is there a better manual that you know of and could suggest?"

CafeRacers,3d4rh8,I_jus_lurk_here,12,Mon Jul 13 14:51:52 2015 UTC,"My favorite online vendors: RevZilla (great product videos and customer service), BikeBandit, MotorcycleSuperstore, and CycleGear (their website sucks but their store here in San Diego is great).   As for the helmet, beyond the normal DOT safety cert what you are paying for is fit and finish. As a very general rule of thumb, you get what you pay for. Want more vents and a ""custom"" feel fit? It's going to cost more than your basic Scorpion EXO 410 helmet for $160. That was my first helmet, did the job ok but had little airflow. Now I have an Icon Airmada for $270 and the fit around my face and the airflow is much improved.   On the same note, you are also generally paying a higher price for more quality construction of the gear. Another example here: had a fairly cheap ($150) Speed And Strength jacket. Pretty basic, nothing spectacular as I didn't need every option under the sun. But, after about a year of normal everyday commuting it started to rip at the seams. I took it with me to compare with some other jackets in store and you see and just feel the difference. The fit and quality materials and construction of other brands was very obvious.   I would recommend a backpack for your bike setup. I have a tail bag made by Motocentric that uses four bungies with hooks on the ends to strap into my passenger seat, but a Thruxton doesn't have one. And I'd be worried about it scratching your paint. For a backpack, I was turned on to the Hazard4 line and will never use anything else. They are single strap sling backpacks and fit amazingly. The wide padded shoulder strap, combined with a small stabilizing strap under the opposite arm holds your bag close and comfortable to your body. Great feature too, just undo the stabilizing strap and you can swing the bag around to your front to access it without taking the whole bag off. This is what I currently use: http://www.hazard4.com/products/packs/slings/switchback  As far as your question about what SHOULD you drop extra cash on, I'm going to be a bit biased here. Full disclosure, I am an EMT and have treated motorcycle accident patients who had little to no gear on. It isn't pretty, and I'll spare the gory details because you don't want to hear it and I don't want to think about it. But, after seeing what happens with no gear, or cheap Walmart gear, to the human body at highway speeds I will always pay more for a quality helmet, decent jacket, jeans with Kevlar or aramid liner, and good leather gloves. Cheap helmet with no DOT rating? Better have saved up for reconstruction surgery, if you even know who you are after the brain bleed turns you into a bed bound stroke victim. Normal jeans with no abrasion resistant liner? The local icu burn center has scrub rooms to clean large burns with heavy doors and play loud music so you can't hear screaming from the hall.   So yeah, spend the money on quality helmet, jacket, gloves, pants, and boots. You don't need to go full Alpinestars $1,500 leather track suit.  But you shouldn't feel bad about dropping $200 each on pants and jacket, another $200 on a helmet, $70 for gloves, and $100 on boots. You want solid construction, rigid design, and comfort. You won't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Getting all those in one item is what costs extra.   Straight leather is a good option. Make sure it has perforation or textile mesh under the arms or something if you live in a warm climate. And is full grain, not some cheap crap. CE armor in the elbows/forearms, shoulders, and spine are good to have. Leather helps with abrasion, not broken bones.   As I said before, riding jeans are a good option if you get the right ones versus textile or leather. I had a pair of Sliders Kevlar lined jeans and they were okay, but nothing great. Fit was off, super baggy, and pretty hot. Now I have a pair of Icon Overlord jeans and they are much better. They fit in riding position very well. Have knee armor, breathe much better, and still have an abrasion resistant lining. Cost me $160. Well worth it.   This was long and rambling, and probably a few spelling and grammar errors but my head is pounding after last night so eat me. Let me know if you have any questions, and enjoy your Thruxton its a beautiful bike!"

CafeRacers,3d4rh8,Yayinternet,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:32 2015 UTC,"do you (or anyone really) have any experience with Rokker jeans?  I have had a couple people recommend them as being amazing and probably a good investment for a new rider, however, they are $500.  I am all for dropping the money if the tech is worth it but aside from just being a top of the line product, is that something thats worth the cost?"
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,Smoked_Bear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:24 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents, $500 for jeans sounds a bit ridiculous. Then again, I haven't tried them ;) $500 is something I'd spend on leather pants because they're the best protection. I'm not sure how much protection those jeans offer, but it's usually much lower than anything leather. Sounds like the pricetag is mostly paying for the name brand. I could be wrong though."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,missallij,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:21:01 2015 UTC,"http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/rokker-original-jeans  Take a look and see if anything in the video/product description sounds like it worth its weight.  Ive heard amazing things such as ""will stand up to the 150lb 11 second drag test""....what that means? I dont know, Im still new at this but numbers are cool."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,rocketusa,2,Tue Jul 14 02:39:38 2015 UTC,"First I've heard of that test, but you can find videos of guys putting weighted bags in jeans and dragging them at speed to see when the abrasion breaks through.   For these jeans, after watching the RevZilla video I'd say the price comes from a couple different factors. First, is that they are advertising these as designer jeans. They even compare them to Diesel brand jeans, which run about $200 a pair. So that's our starting point. Whether you buy into designer men's jeans or not, that's where they're coming from.   Second, these have a full length abrasion resistant layer within the jeans. Most riding jeans have panels of protective material like Kevlar or Aramid in specific at-risk areas like the seat, the hips, and knees.   They seems a bit overkill to me. I'd rather have a pair of good every day style jeans with protection than pay a premium for designer jeans. Because drop that designer tag and these suddenly become more reasonable at around $230."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,mykepagan,2,Tue Jul 14 05:57:03 2015 UTC,"Revzilla is AMAZING!! I love that site. Also I agree with everything OP has to say. I work at a Harley dealer in the Motorclothes dept (its my job to properly fit helmets and jackets). So spending a little extra on those items is a must. To add, for a full leather jacket also look for any sort of venting (perforated, zip sides, textile) and reflective as well. ALSO check the jackets for armor pockets, leather jackets have those too, they should have a pocket for AT LEAST the shoulders and elbows. Also with boots, they should be stitched soles, glued soles come un-glued (lol) from the heat over time.   Also if you're making it a daily rider, I do suggest rain gear to help keep the leather nice. It looks goofy but it'll keep you dry.   PM me if you have other questions, I also realized I'm behind on responding...I didn't know that this sub existed."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,sebwiers,4,Wed Jul 15 03:32:59 2015 UTC,"Looking good/convenience <------------> Safety  Everyone has their comfort level. The absolute safest would be a full-body one-piece racing suit, complete with spine, knee, shin and elbow guards, in florescent high-vis color. Are you going to suit up like that every time you get on the bike? Most people opt for a balance of convenience and safety into these four items: A helmet, a leather jacket, leather gloves, and riding boots."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,sebwiers,2,Mon Jul 13 18:50:10 2015 UTC,"The key thing is to wear your protective gear. Your set of old above-the-ankle workbooks will protect you almost as well as a $550 set of Sidi race boots. So just wear a helmet, gloves, boots, jacket, and pants.  The difference between a $180 catalog helmet and a $600 Arai or Shoei will be: * fit - the cheap helmets will not have as many options * weight - pricey helmets are light, can be worn longer without fatigue * noise - cheap helmets are LOUDER inside from wind noise * aerodynamics - pricey helmets usually buffet less * ventilation * liner material quality  Get what you can afford, but also what will not be so uncomfortable that you decide not to wear it.  Jackets: textile jackets (like Joe Rocket or Icon) are affordable and versatile. Get one with a waterproof she'll for rain. Buy it big enough to layer under for cold weather. Non motorcycle jackets tend to flap annoyingly at speed. A real motorcycle jacket will either be heavy enough not to flap or have elastic tabs to control wind flap.  Gloves: good heavy work gloves are fine.  Ones used for construction site or mechanics cut resistance work great in the summer. They are synthetic and don't absorb water much so they are ok in rain in a pinch.  Boots: anything over the ankle. Work boots are fine. You can get rainproof over boots for bad weather, or just use plastic baggies like he bikers of olde.  Now to proselytize my favorite but expensive brand: Aerostich. I had a Roadcrafter one-piece suit for 10 years that my brother continues to use (I got fat).  Since then I have used an Aerostich Darien suit for 10 more years. Crashed twice in it, and the suit is unharmed (and saved me from a broken elbow, but couldn't prevent broken ribs, flail chest, and hemothorax but that's another story). I have used the same pair of Combat Touring boots for the full 20 years.  Just google Riderwarehouse. They are amazing and the high cost is offset by extreme durability.  Their stuff literally lasts for decades of hard use."
CafeRacers,3d4rh8,SpooneyMean485,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:10 2015 UTC,"What am I really paying for in a helmet between a $200 and $500 option?   Usually lower weight (composite fiber vs plastic shell) and slightly better construction (not protection wise, but 'fit and finish' wise- which may reduce wind noise).    Are straight leather boots/jacket/gloves a poor option?    If properly made they are quite good for abrasion construction.  But you'll still take a hammering, which the additional padding and plates on modern (vs 'classic') gear helps prevent."

I also live in Texas where it's hot as shit, so I am concerned with venting I suppose."

CafeRacers,3cy8vn,CL-MotoTech,2,Sat Jul 11 21:32:30 2015 UTC,2-part foam and body filler are heavy and time consuming. You are way better off building a lightweight wooden pan and then working insulation or other cheap and light foams into a shape whereby you can do a layer of fiberglass to complete the pan. The skill set required to complete this method is slightly more in-depth but the end product will be much better.

The engine is the same but has no electric starter. Also it is a 5 speed not a six. They have a drum front brake not disk.

This bike wasn't a show room bike (as you can see!) as it was missing some parts, had old paint/gas and didn't run, but it was mostly complete and turned. Bought it for $550 and took her home, cleaned up the carbs, new fuses, battery and started her up. Now it's in my basement slowly being worked on haha.  Thankfully the seller knew what he had and understood the work that was needed to be done to get going and looking good. None of that ""potential café racer bike"" so that they can inflate the price. Just be patient and you'll find the right bike at the right price."
CafeRacers,3cncdy,rocketsnails,5,Thu Jul 9 07:24:42 2015 UTC,This is how you do it - stay away from opportunists; buy something honest and put aside by someone who will sell for what it's worth to them.

CafeRacers,3cm4f6,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:38:18 2015 UTC,"Just an option, and sort of a controversial one, but here goes:  Snag a Suzuki s40/savage off of craigslist.  Depending on your area, you should be able to find a decently aged (1998+) bike for close to a grand.  Use this bike to learn, ride, and get some real seat time.  After you have invested some time into learning how to ride and start to feel comfortable head over to www.rycamotors.com and see if you are interested in doing a conversion into a cafe racer/scrambler/etc with the bike you already have.  This is going to involve at least another $3200 bucks (kit + tools), however, the aesthetic change will breathe new life into the bike itself.  Ryca will provide all the parts and convert your old gas tank (keep this in mind - get a bike with a dent-free gas tank) and rear hub.  They also provide pretty decent instructional videos for each and every little step.  A couple things to consider (I JUST went through this deliberation with myself before buying my bike).  You buy a 1-1.2k bike off craigslist and dump money to make it pretty and to your taste.  This does not make the bike worth 4-5k now. Realistically you could still only sell the bike for close to what you paid for it unless you found someone with the same taste who was willing to, essentially, pay you for your work on it.  Secondly, the bike will be OOC while you work on it.  The site says the 'average rider' can have the bike fully converted in roughly 40 hours work time with a few tools and garage space - but the turnaround on the tank/rear hub is about a month.  Take that into consideration if this is your ONLY mode of transportation.  The kits will do NOTHING to the engine, and while the Suzuki's are renown for their durability, you want to consider the health of your engine before investing money to make her pretty.    One big plus to going this route is that you will have torn off and reassembled everything (sans engine) on the bike giving you a lot more experience and potentially a head-start to fixing any minor problems that may occur down the line (wiring, changing linkages, rearset adjustment, etc).  It is an option, especially if you never plan on getting rid of the bike, but in my opinion after a year or so you will want something that has a little more vroom.    The CS-1 will get you up to highway speed, will be great for commuting, and I think they are gorgeous.  So take a look and see if that's something that might interest you.  Even though I went the Triumph route, I will still shamelessly plug Ryca because they were great every time I contacted them (which was a lot) with another little question.  I have two friends that are in love with their Ryca's and I may still end up building one (at some point).  Cheers."

Try to get some wired wheels on it. Cafe seat, cafe tank.  That's if you're hell bent on the cafe vibe. I think it looks fine now but with some time and like 600$ you could build a fun head turner. Sure.  Edit- now that I look at it I think you're going to want to get rid of the entire subframe in order to level out the seat/gas tank ""line"". You can build one pretty easy with a simple mig welder and about $30 of metal from Home Depot."

CafeRacers,3c281d,_HagbardCeline,3,Sat Jul 4 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"Ariel ace is a very nicely done girder fork, yep.  But that is a design almost as old as motorcycles.  This design uses similar parts as a girder fork, but flips them around so that the pivoting arms do not get steered, but instead hold the 'steering head' while it moves up and down.  One benefit from doing so is its possible to keep trail constant while having a vertical wheel path.  A vertical wheel path means much less brake dive, but with a normal giddy you have to compromise between trail changes (usually a decrease when compressed) and optimal wheel path, because the steering head is fixed to the frame."

May grab a scale next time it's apart to weigh both, but optimizing for weight isn't really in my skill set.  Most of the aluminum bits are still just rough shaped and will get milled down similar to how the top bar is, which will shave off a pound or two.

CafeRacers,3c0jqk,hasansabbah,2,Fri Jul 3 21:03:41 2015 UTC,thats fiberglass. I used the foam block method to make a positive mold and then I laid up fiberglass mat on top. it didn't come out great and needed a lot of sanding and bond work
CafeRacers,3c0jqk,LunaLake,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"Would you recommend me to do that? I'm going to need to design a seat also, to replace last one that doesn't fit anymore(i cut the tail). I was thinking of cutting it and wrap it with leather."
CafeRacers,3c0jqk,LunaLake,2,Fri Jul 3 21:30:32 2015 UTC,"if I was to do it over I would do it one of two ways.  1) use the foam blocks to shape the seat. add an extra 2-3"" on the bottom of the seat (so the seat sits high on the sides). Use fiberglass cloth. This will ensure you have even layers and a relatively smooth finish. leaving it high will help make sure the cloth sits nice and flat (you will cut the 2-3 inches off when mounting). It will be tough using fiberglass cloth around the corners though. (2) the best way to do it is use foam to shape. lay up glass on top. remove the foam once the glass is cured and use that shell as a negative mold. Some thought needs to be put into this since your end product will be smaller than the foam mold you created on the inner surface. so to make sure it fits around your frame you will have to shape the foam to overhang the frame a bit. The benefit of using a negative mold is that (as long as your mold is good) your seat will have a nice finish right out of the mold and minimal sanding / bondo will be required.   IF youre going to wrap the whole thing in leather, you COULD make the seat out of wood. I would take some solid wood blocks and glue them together. make cut outs in each block to give you the rough seat shape (you can also cut out sections so that it is hollow in areas). Once the glue is dry you could shape it up with hand tools. I'd throw some poly on it to give it some water resistance before wrapping it in leather. it will have to be much thicker than using fiberglass so that it has adequate strength"

If you're like me you'll want to customize it too, in which case you'll hit 1k easy. I changed my headlight (50), handlebars (120+30 grips), speedo altimeter (225), new seat/re upholstery (can vary, around 100)...and so on. Not saying it's not worth it, but many times I've looked at my bike and wish I just dropped the 1300 on a fairly new decent working bike. Saw a Honda shadow for 1500, could easily get that price dropped and not have to worry about much save the registration, no hassles needed."

With no airbox in sight, the thing likely has an awful powerband. Hackjob straightpipe exhaust and WTF seat. That's just my initial impression of what's in the photos.

CafeRacers,3bwe6r,Adroite,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:09:40 2015 UTC,"Welcome.  Yea it all depends on where you live I realize, but basically have to try not to jump at the first few bikes you see.  Not implying you were here, but it took me a pretty long time to finally have a sale go through.  I sent e-mails to close to 20 sellers, had about 4-5 respond, and only a couple actually followed through with that one month.   With these types of bikes trending right now, prices are a tad inflated, but you can still find those cheap bikes out there if you look hard enough.  The big thing though is $600 is more then enough for a road ready bike that has a title.  You might start paying more if there is a very specific model you want though.    Beyond that, make sure you really read up on the bike you want.  As a for instance, I was also looking at cx-500's awhile back and read that some of them were recalled.  Some of the bikes were fixed, some not... So when you're out there looking, make sure your also not buying into a problem that wasn't fixed 30 years ago.  This can also give you leverage as a buyer as well."
CafeRacers,3bwe6r,verrukt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:57:38 2015 UTC,Yeah these kinds of details are why I'm always here. I'm living in an apartment at the moment and don't have a safe place to keep a motorcycle (I'd be worried about it getting stolen if its not in a garage) so I come here to learn as much as I can in the meantime.   Seems there are a lot of finer details that more experienced people wouldn't find significant enough to mention.   I was actually wondering if this style was trending too. The implications on price make it relevant so thank you for that.

If the engine sounds mechanically okay and the frame is straight (and it has a clean title) I'd offer him 500, won't be too hard to set it up the right way.

CafeRacers,3bfd49,NiceKicksGabe,2,Sun Jun 28 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"So the way I look at it, the quality of the project bike you pick up is a continuum. If I were you, I would favor something in the middle: it may not run, but it probably doesn't need a ton of work to get running. If you're going to strip it down and rebuild anyway, there's no real reason to get a mint condition classic or anything. Find something that runs (or did run) but is in bad shape cosmetically. That way, your project will consist more of customizing it to your liking than trying to rebuild an engine with chunks missing or broken."
CafeRacers,3bfd49,ZeroG,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:21:00 2015 UTC,I recently stumbled upon a CB500 with a locked up engine and a few missing cosmetic parts.

CafeRacers,3bfd49,ZeroG,2,Sun Jun 28 22:12:50 2015 UTC,"Depending on parts availability and your own skill, oy could be worth it. Just know any project is going to cost more than you think... Unless you know a welder/mechanic who's willing to help you out for free."

CafeRacers,3b6sv0,makanimike,3,Fri Jun 26 15:33:47 2015 UTC,Thanks. I didn't know that.
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:45:56 2015 UTC,Hey. This is a beautiful build. Can I ask why you went with the earlier SOHC? Was it just visual appeal? This is certainly one visually appealing bike.
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,1t_is_What_1t_is,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:51:46 2015 UTC,Generally SOHC models are much more desirable. They were very simple and were the forerunner for most of the 4cyl bikes that came out of Japan years later.
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,ludacity,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:28:29 2015 UTC,Spenzod's reply pretty much said it. But also the overall visual appeal. The straight lines in the frame and the tank.  I have to admit it was looks more than technique.
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,ludacity,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:15:07 2015 UTC,Looks great! I have a K7 myself waiting for a new rail and seat. I'm just stuck on if in going to keep the big wide k7/8 tank or move to a slimmer 550 or k5/6 tank.  Love to see some pictures of the hoop and seat build!
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,NiceKicksGabe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:27:05 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue. So now I'm starting out with the original k7 tank. Then I can always change it if I find another nice one. thought about having 2-3 tanks to experiment with and change around ones in a while.  Despite the narrow seat and the wide tank, I think it worked out ok.  http://i.imgur.com/5EVrt8F.jpg"
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,29palms,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:22:56 2015 UTC,Very very beautiful. Since you are from Europe and I am also currently building a CB750 (albeit a DOHC model) I am interested in hearing more about the legal side. Have you passed inspection already? Is everything street legal?
CafeRacers,3b6sv0,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:44:57 2015 UTC,"No inspection yet. But as far as I know, it is not street legal as shown in pictures. I need fenders both front and back. But besides that, it is OK.  The rear end has been cut off and replaced. But where in Denmark that is OK, as long as it's done behind the rear suspension."

CafeRacers,3b5wb8,356afan,2,Sat Jun 27 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"Post a pic of the bike and we can go from there. The Ryca conversion has a few different levels and if you went with the hardtail bobber, it cuts the whole rear of the frame off."

CafeRacers,3b4a3h,SlashFive,4,Thu Jun 25 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"if you follow Lossa Engineering, we put out a CL450 about 2 years ago with those tires on it. (its on bike EXIF, has ammo can saddlebags) they are flat track tires and not very good on the road.  when we got the bike above 55mph, it would slide all over the road, had almost no traction on the freeway. it was pretty scary.  I would avoid unless your legitimately going to go flat tracking your bike."
CafeRacers,3b4a3h,hondabuilder,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:58:48 2015 UTC,Never heard of the company before but they seem to be GoldenTyre some sort of flat-track model (so useless on the street). http://www.goldentyre.com/en/products/flat-track/#all/1/list
CafeRacers,3b4a3h,SophisticatedVagrant,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:57:58 2015 UTC,"Those are non-DOT tires, but there are flat track tires for the street such as the Dunlop K180."
CafeRacers,3b4a3h,T1978_sach,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:28:28 2015 UTC,Dunlop TT100s are an older design and what was being run by the high performance bikes and cafes prior to current day sport or superbikes. Exceptional road holding and capable of withstanding constant high speeds. Personal experience.
CafeRacers,3b4a3h,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"whatever the tires, but what a beautiful bike!"
CafeRacers,3b4a3h,bigBastardDude,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like the brand is Goldentyre and they are flat track tires. Flat track tires are usually softer and meant to stick to the track which is usually packed dirt/clay. They would probably unpredictable at best on the street and would probably not survive very long.   I've never ridden them myself but I can't image it being a good idea. I agree with you in that the tread is really cool looking, but imo they're just not suited for any type of riding other than flat track racing.  I'm not sure of anything similarly styled that's more street worthy but I'm sure someone else can point you in the right direction. Good Luck!"

CafeRacers,3b0x64,DrBerminverter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:02 2015 UTC,I bought a spare tank on ebay for 50 with a good cap and latch.
CafeRacers,3b0x64,NotSeriousAtAll,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:58:16 2015 UTC,Good idea that I hadn't tried yet but I just googl'd around and can't find a tank with a cap/latch for <$100. Maybe it's become a rare piece recently?
CafeRacers,3b0x64,NotSeriousAtAll,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:09:08 2015 UTC,How bad are yours? They clean up pretty well. I had one that was really rusted on the bottom and had been badly painted. I soaked it in Evapo-Rust. Then I baking soda blasted the paint off and used chrome polish. It looks almost new. It just needs a new seal.
CafeRacers,3b0x64,jaim1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:17:59 2015 UTC,Non existent. The tank is from a local boneyard and it didn't have the cap or latch. Maybe I can go back there and find one for a decent price. I expect the latch will be difficult to find but I don't mind paying $50 for the latch online if I can get the cap for $10 at the boneyard.

CafeRacers,3avizt,LockeClone,2,Tue Jun 23 22:50:56 2015 UTC,I'd think twice before putting clubmans on without rearsets. You'll be stuck in an awkward crouch and the bike won't handle any better.   Think about what you want your bike to do that it doesn't already. The function informs the form when it comes to motorcycles that you want to ride. Cafe racers are for short rides through the canyon. Is that what you want to do with your bike?
CafeRacers,3avizt,george_harrison_ford,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:26:28 2015 UTC,"Great, I wasn't even worried about rearsets till now.. But your right, I'll see how I feel with the clubmans and then if I need it, I'll get the universal rearsets from dime city cycles. As for what I'm using the bike for, it will be mainly for short commutes, and evening rides, but I wanted clubmans so that if I ever go on a longer trip I could flip them upside down and have them in a more comfortable position like the ones I have on now..."
CafeRacers,3avizt,visionofacheezburger,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"I'd move the headlight down (maybe flip the fork ears upside down), throw on some aftermarket signals that aren't so bulky, move/replace/eliminate the gauges. Maybe make some DIY side covers or just gut it out with a small battery/pod filter (if you wanna mess around with that). Like the guy above said, clubmans and a brat seat would look great (I'd recommend making you're own, it's not that hard and only takes one day if you've got the right materials).   Can't see the back end, but if there's a fender, remove it or shorten it. The front fender looks pretty good actually, large enough to serve it's purpose, but not an eyesore.  Edit: Also, I know this is /r/CafeRacers, but if you're interested in keeping those bars, I really love the look of cruiser bars like those with a brat seat (true Bratstyle)."

CafeRacers,3auuzm,AgnewsNews,2,Tue Jun 23 18:16:50 2015 UTC,I think the detail with which the seller talked about what is going on with the bike makes this very interesting. I mean it basically tells you that bike wasn't  completely disregarded. But with all those things that is not ok with it you would have to do a lot of work. If you think you really want to pick this up as a hobby go fot it but be prepared it is a lot of time. Look at this youtube channel this guy has a lot of experience and it took him about 2 years to get that sabre into the state he wanted: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8SLiVEQM9KNBccNx4p2W9W5ggKPFy30w
CafeRacers,3auuzm,Mateking,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"So I just spoke with the seller, very helpful guy. He says that the compression is most likely low in at least one cylinder as can be seen by oil blow by on the carburetor heat sinks. I asked if it was due to seals or gaskets since he mentions he has them in the description, it seemed like he was going to replace them, but he wasn't exactly sure the cause. What isn't mentioned in the ad though is that he has gotten it up to ""more than just posted highway speeds"" on flats, but it struggles to maintain speed going up hills. And that the bike was originally from the east coast and has not been tuned to being in Phoenix AZ.   As for the amount of work that can be expected, I'm not too terribly concerned. I've been wanting a motorcycle, and I've also been looking for something to spend my weekends more productively, so I figured why not combine those two. I've got a car as a daily driver, so I don't need it to be running 24/7. I'd really like to take the time to learn how to work on it and make sure the performance and reliability is there before worrying about custom fabricated tanks. But I'll definitely be checking out that video once I get out of work, thanks for the link!"
CafeRacers,3auuzm,loafyy,2,Tue Jun 23 21:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm in the same boat that you are in when it comes to getting a bike and wanting to work on it. From what I've read it seems like you should spend some more money on an already running and moving bike as working platform. do your modifications from there instead of starting with almost nothing and trying to build a nice working racer.
CafeRacers,3auuzm,loafyy,2,Thu Jun 25 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"I actually got the chance to see it in person last night. It runs, started up on the first try after sitting for a couple months. Would need a new battery and new tires to be actually rideable again. As far as that massive parts list, it's pretty much a whole other bike including original engine with 20k miles on it. Original bike is a CB750F, but the engine that is in it is from the second bike which was a CB750K. He said that the F is harder to get parts for since Honda made more annual tweaks to the engine while the K was more consistent from year to year. If I can get it for what I want I think I'll be happy. If not this one I'll probably wait until December for the Christmas bonus to bolster my budget."

Great gauges all around.   If you're really on a budget, check out Koso: http://kosonorthamerica.com They make some very decent stuff and I've only heard good things about them, although not the prettiest in my opinion.   Now if you're not under a tight budget and really want to retain that more classic look with excellent quality, go to SpeedHut: http://www.speedhut.com They marry classic styling with some very nice tech, like GPS speedo. Incredibly customizable and very high quality, but they are not weatherproof as they were orig intended for custom cars.   Finally, if money is no concern, Motogadget: http://motogadget.com/en/ Incredible German quality at a pant shitting price point.

CafeRacers,3aqxh8,ruckus666,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true, american vehicle laws are really wide in comparison with the Brazilian ones, here, if you don't have front turn signals the police officers will pull you down and fine you as soon as possible, and the fine here is really high, like what an average person earns in a month. So, check the vehicle laws of your state before you take off your front signals, because this can bring a lot of headaches."
CafeRacers,3aqxh8,superafim,2,Tue Jun 23 02:02:34 2015 UTC,It may seem crazy but in a lot of places they are not required by law.
CafeRacers,3aqxh8,NotSeriousAtAll,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"Most older bikes (which make up a lot of Cafe bikes) originally came with HUGE front turn signals. I'm struggling with the idea of putting some on now since I have the front-end dismantled but put some thought into it and realized that the turn signals I would get would put out very little light compared to the sun. And I don't ride a lot at night in the city because the street I'm next to has seen a lot of bike wrecks (one deadly just a week or two ago). I instead cross-wired my front signals into my back ones (which are really f'ing bright) so that they would stay on all the time unless I'm signaling. I'm MUCH more concerned about my visibility from behind at night/day rather than somebody seeing a tiny front-signal a street-width ahead of me so that was my reasoning behind this. I've found that pointing my wheel in the direction I want to go toward is signal enough as I never assume that a car is really caring what I'm doing anyway.   Not a great justification, I'm sure, but like other comments suggestion: they're not usually required. I live in Charlotte, NC though and nobody, regardless of vehicle, uses their signals anyway!"
CafeRacers,3aqxh8,the_candidate,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:34:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't put front signals on because it's not legally required to have any signals where I live.

There are a lot of half baked projects out there that you can pick up for a steal. Think about buying one of those for cheap and keeping this one as a point of reference and daily ride. Another benefit of getting someone's unfinished project is it often comes with a few common mods you can salvage and you won't be as scared to take a grinder or welder to the frame.  Second thing is having two bikes means you can have one which is single seat, impractical, with all your experimental mods done to it; then you have a second one with two seats, and a little more comfortable, for when you need to take a girl out.  Whatever your choice, enjoy. I'm envious."

More on the lines of that looks quite large maybe a smaller light :D  Maybe something like this https://www.pinterest.com/pin/265571709250962643/  Although I am not quite convinced with that form either.

CafeRacers,3al4xk,Was_that_the_joke,11,Sun Jun 21 07:09:10 2015 UTC,We were almost going to be a dealer for those bikes but when we saw how shitty they actually were we declined.  Sell it and get a Honda you'll be much happier in the long run.  Not trying to be rude. Just honest.
CafeRacers,3al4xk,luckydroidmetalwerks,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:48:27 2015 UTC,What kind of Honda would be comparable in size and price to this bike?
CafeRacers,3al4xk,phalanx94,2,Sun Jun 21 17:50:00 2015 UTC,As far as new bikes go. The Honda Grom.  Older bikes. You can get a reliable running 80s or 90s nighthawk for 1500-2500. Nighthawks are usually kept in better shape than the early CBs which are usually all clapped out and need a full restoration.
CafeRacers,3al4xk,luckydroidmetalwerks,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"+1 for the Nighthawk. The 250 is pretty mild, but a sprocket swap will push the torque a bit, and I've seen some really nice looking cafe jobs on them. It's a fantastic city bike to whip around at low speeds.  The 750, I've heard, is THE PERFECT touring bike for lightness, highway power, and gas mileage. That's only hearsay, though. I haven't had the pleasure of riding one yet."
CafeRacers,3al4xk,denkyuu,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"It aint that shitty. Don't get me wrong, the top speed sucks, and the acceleration sucks. but the gas mileage is great, runs reliably, and looks cool. General consensus seems to be sell and get a better bike. I'll end up doing just that"
CafeRacers,3al4xk,luckydroidmetalwerks,3,Sun Jun 21 23:51:10 2015 UTC,They are built with good intentions but the quality control isn't up there with the big Four. They are Chinese built bikes and you have to replace every fastener with high grade nuts and bolts or it will fall apart on the road after some time.  the engineering that went into the motor is fairly solid though
CafeRacers,3al4xk,RealDealRio,2,Mon Jun 22 00:12:52 2015 UTC,Making it better is pretty subjective here man. Looks like a sick bike overall and well designed. I wouldnt reccomend changing any of the lines regarding the seat/tank and the front fender/rear shocks. The reason so many cafes look not quite right is because they dont understand how those are the focus of the bike. Other than that it will be all preference for you. Have fun man.
CafeRacers,3al4xk,SixGunGorilla,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:43:43 2015 UTC,"Take off the rear fender and wire the lights so that they act as brake, turn, and running  or get 3 wire lights and connect it all to those. There are better explanations online."
CafeRacers,3al4xk,Imeatbag,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:00:12 2015 UTC,You probably can't make it faster so make it handle better. Not sure how good the stock parts are but usually it means better suspension and tires. Good looking bike though and they look like fun.
CafeRacers,3al4xk,liesthroughhisteeth,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:30:15 2015 UTC,"Just leave it be. It's a starter bike and a darned nice one and quite unique, so why screw with it.

Back in the 90s kids I knew in high school were pulling basket case hot rod projects out of people's barns and turning them back into working vehicles. But when you came across something stock or mostly stock in excellent condition you didn't chop it up. You gave it a bath and cheap restoration and sold it to a middle aged dude with fond memories. I love cafe bikes and rat bikes, I just don't like to see really good nearly pristine old vehicles torn up and half assed. We lose a lot of our motoring heritage to that. Just saying."
CafeRacers,3ae8j6,Mateking,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:58:23 2015 UTC,I think he was trying to say that he would leave it in exactly that state  in which it is possible to get it back to the original state.   But you can't seriously be against getting off that fairing and ugly backrest and maybe swapping out those handlebars. I think that would already improve the bike massively and it still would be possible to put everything back without much effort.

CafeRacers,3abvb2,ChamberlainRacing,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"My only concern is if the bike is in good shape. When people say ""rebuilt carb, forks,"" I get worried. 90% of people, even shop mechanics don't have a clue to what they are doing. First thing is to make sure that bike runs good. If they ""rebuilt"" the carb then it better run crisp. If it doesn't run crisp then they didn't rebuilt the car right. That is my advice. But the bike looks nice, and your inspiration looks dope. I haven't build yet, but I am about to start two projects. Make sure you just take your time and have fun building it."
CafeRacers,3abvb2,ChamberlainRacing,0,Thu Jun 18 22:23:39 2015 UTC,That's awesome advice. Thanks man. Any pointers on how to know if the bike is running okay? Anything I should be looking for if I go check it out or take a test drive?
CafeRacers,3abvb2,noeatnosleep,2,Thu Jun 18 22:59:22 2015 UTC,"This has some okay tips, like in the last section. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Revive-an-Old-Motorcycle/?ALLSTEPS   But make sure it sounds good. You don't want to hear the piston knocking. Make sure that once it is warmed up it runs on idle smoothly. If it sounds weird or isn't a smooth running bike something might be up. Make sure you ride it. I don't know how experienced you are so be careful. Make sure things like the gas hose from the gas tank are not all rotted up. Easy fix though. It is always a risk buying used. I would also say go with your gut, is the seller honest? That will be up to your gut. 28,000 miles isn't too bad. Also, I would try to get that price down as much as possible. Because you want to build it, you are still going to put money into it. Let us know if you get it. Do you have any knowledgeable friends that ride, bring them to see it too. Worst case, you could always tell him you would like to bring it to a mechanic and want a full refund if anything serious is wrong."

CafeRacers,3a70jv,FourthOf5,3,Wed Jun 17 20:53:58 2015 UTC,It's worth what you are willing to pay for it.
CafeRacers,3a70jv,NotSeriousAtAll,2,Thu Jun 18 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"So I have a CX500 that I'm about to finish, it's too small of a bike for me (size-wise, I'm 6'3 and it looks like a toy, but plenty of power for the displacement... in a city... dammit I need to move). Anyway it's like this: I want to sell mine way more than I paid for it ($900) because well I'm an idiot and it was my first build so I over-paid and over-replaced parts. But more so than that, I know the cafe-bike craze is a thing and people are willing to pay a premium.   Is it worth it: No. Why? 30k miles is where the electrical goes wrong on these bikes. The stator, specifically. It's a relatively cheap part, but the thing is: you have to take the engine out and apart to replace it. Shit will go wrong. You'll replace more parts or spend time repairing the existing ones. At that point, why not buy one that's less good-looking but more mechanically sound (I got mine with 9k miles) and put that time and effort into making it yours instead of somebody else's. The answer: because you don't want to deal with that shit. And for good cause. I took up bike-building to get my lame ass out from the computer and working on stuff with my hands so I could take out my frustration with a wrench instead of booze. It's been worth it. One hour on working on mine and I'm back to neutral, so to speak.  Seriously, TLDR: CX500's are amazingly-engineered bikes with the exception of their electrical system. Plus at that milage you're almost due for the triple bypass that these bikes need.  This is mine and I have less than your price built in, still with less than 10k miles. Don't be afraid to look elsewhere, I've had a few friends find awesome deals on eBay that the $500 shipping still made worthwhile  However, if you're able to talk this guy down and get this bike, there are a HUGE amount of resources online for maintenance. Treated right, the CX500 will run forever. Just commenting here because if you have no intention of wrenching this on your own nor have a local bike shop, you may come into some problems which will increase this pricetag by $1k."
CafeRacers,3a70jv,the_candidate,2,Thu Jun 18 04:12:44 2015 UTC,From where I am standing it seems extremely difficult to find a bike from 1978-1983 with under 10k miles. I am happy with my honda gb500 from 1989 with 22k miles. I am in Europe though so things may be different.  And by the way imho basically moding a completely new bike seems like a not very sensible thing to do.

CafeRacers,3a7hki,kickinit1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"I had a LTD454 for a little while, and it was an amazing bike and probably my favorite to ride. Don't be fooled by the look, this bike is a cruiser with the heart of a sports bike. It was the most comfortable bike I've ever ridden AND I once walked a corvette off the line, plus it made a sound like no other bike I had ever ridden.  Funny enough back when the LTD 454 was launched there was a marketing campaign ""454 vs 454"" which put the LTD against a big block corvette, the LTD won.   Here's what I know about the bike! That year has a 454 because they took a Ninja 900(909cc) engine and took off two cylinders in essence (909/2 = 454.5) so all the internals you could need like jugs, pistons etc. will all work from the same year 900 motor, cheap parts. This is also the first EN to get liquid cooling, it redlined at 10k, has DOHC with 4 valves per cylinders. This bike makes power I promise you that.   As far as weight goes?  CX500 weighs 530lbs wet and 50hp LTD454 weighs 445lbs wet again 50hp XS650 weighs 450 wet annnnnd again 50hp  The LTD is the lightest of the most common UJM bikes that make the same power and above all else early Japanese bikes are known as UJM's and that U stands for universal. All these bikes make 50hp but the way they're tuned is what makes the difference. The power to weight is the same but the Torque to RPM and all that varies.  Only downside to the bike? The carburetors. If maintained and kept well, they're good. But they're 34mm vacuum carbs, most other bikes from that time use gravity fed, and moving from gravity fed to vacuum fed is gonna be tricky to learn. It's how I lost my 454, I just rebuilt the carbs with my brother, it had a upfire and sent flames out of the carbs and caught the bike on fire mid ride.   My advice, get it, roll it into your back yard and then take off the tank, the seat, the air box covers and rear fender. Step back and take a look at it. It's a sporty frame, with a sports bike heart and a lot of potential."

As I've stated before in CX500 threads, these bikes have a very serious electrical/design flaw. The stator will go out, 100% of the time; and this will cause a lot of electrical issues with the ignition. You will need to invest $400-$500 on an ignitech ignition out of the ukraine or remove the stator have it rebuilt and put it back in (will run you about $1000-$1500) This one is listed as having a new stator which is good, but unless you know how well it was installed and what quality it is -- it might go out in 10k miles as well."

CafeRacers,39zuil,gigglemygaggle,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:04:31 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'm ready to start a new one.
CafeRacers,39zuil,CodySix,4,Wed Jun 17 03:58:19 2015 UTC,If you pay that much for that bike your nuts. I bought a mint and I mean mint condition cx500 deluxe for $1200 Canadian! And it had a safety so I had plates on it that day. I also found parts everywhere for upgrades. Also it's by far the easiest bike to work on.
CafeRacers,39zuil,YawnY86,3,Tue Jun 16 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the CX bikes, it's the first bike I ever bought. Maintaining it is incredibly easy and it's a pretty nice ride. That being said, I would not pay anything near that. I got a mint condition '78 standard with the same miles for less than half of that. Keep looking especially in smaller towns and rural areas, you may end up finding a great deal, just be sure to factor in the cost of transporting the bike."
CafeRacers,39zuil,cabooze94,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:58:23 2015 UTC,"i just bought a cx500c a few weeks ago.  I believe the cx500 is a good platform for a cafe.  They have a funky frame that takes some working around but when executed well they can have a lot of personality compared to some other cafes.  I would not buy from this seller.  Like others have said, you would be overpaying for parts that will end up in the dumpster at the end of the day.  I paid $400 for my cx running and in good condition.  These bikes have flown under the radar for the most part to the cafe craze avoiding the price inflation with it.  One can easily be snagged in running condition for under a grand.    Keep searching craigslist.  Look for something low price and running.  If you like the cx platform look into if you want a deluxe or a custom.  They feature minor differences, most notably the tank with the deluxe being the more commonly cafe'd and sought after style of the two."

CafeRacers,39zuil,badwhiskey63,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:45:09 2015 UTC,"As somone who appreciates ALL bikes. Id recommend finding a running beater and chopping/ modifying it. Bikes in this condition are getting more and more rare because people in the bike community start with a well preserved bike and hack it all up.  If your going to mod a bike, search out a 70s honda thats runs and start from the bottom. In the end youll feel better about the project.  BUT ofcourse its your decision and the CX 500 is a great bike (I built one myself last years!)  Cheers and good luck to you!!!!"
CafeRacers,39zuil,royboyblue,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:19:51 2015 UTC,I sold one last year for $500. It just had a ripped seat and needed new gauges. I've seen a few in good condition in my area sell for $1200.   Looks like this one is in pretty good condition but if you get it try to negotiate the price down a bit. The paint and seat condition don't matter as much when you're taking those things off anyway.
CafeRacers,39zuil,donkeyotee,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:26:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't make my first bike a project bike. it's going to be not running more than running and in the d you won't be riding.  you could easily have a two bike system for that kind of money. I bought a good vfr for a grand just so I will still have a bike to ride while I rebuild my sumo.
CafeRacers,39zuil,kickinit1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"Nice reliable bike, it's not going to be the most beautiful bike on the road but at least you can ride. As others have said it's a little on the expensive side. My buddy got a mint one with 4k miles for $1800."

CafeRacers,39zuil,356afan,0,Tue Jun 16 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, I'm considering buying my first bike this week which I intend to customize over time into a cafe racer/flat tracker. The bike is a 1982 CX 500 c I found on craigslist.  I went to see it last week in a garage in the Bronx. The guy had about 70 other bikes there, mostly hondas and yamahas, all between early 70's and late 80's. I am a bit concerned about the integrity of the business. I've heard that places like this specialize in throwing together bikes from salvaged parts and passing them for originals.  The posting says the bike has no issues, and it is indeed very clean except for a little tarnish on the head covers and chrome. I did notice what looked like a small oil leak coming from somewhere above and behind the starter motor, not sure what to make of this since I am new to motorcycles and not mechanically inclined (although eager to learn).  The actual owner of the bike (and all the bikes in the garage) was not there. So I was talking to one of the other auto body mechanics who claimed to know nothing about motorcycles and could not tell me anything more about the bike. Over the phone, the owner told me he bought the bike from the first owner who was an older guy who owned it for years and fixed it up for his daughter who, as it turned out, had no interest in it. The current owner claims that the only work he did to it was new tires and battery, and yet in the CL add it says ""serviced at the honda dealer"".  And then there is the price, the add says $2,750. He has come down to $2,500. I am offering $2,000 but would consider going up to $2,200, maybe $2,300. He agreed to sell the bike with a 90 day warranty, so if the thing falls apart in the first couple months I can get my money back.  So what do you think? Is this a good first bike? Viable base for cafe customization? Is the price fair considering the age and condition? What is a reasonable offer? Should I trust this seller?"
CafeRacers,39zuil,rawshanks,5,Tue Jun 16 03:09:16 2015 UTC,"I'd back off, but thats just me personally. The price leaves you with very little room to customize/repair future issues, if you put another $1,500 into it your at $4,500 bucks for a 30 year old honda... Love the cx500 but when I buy old bikes I always need buffer room for repairs. I bought a cb550 a few years back that looked brand new when i got it and I spent a lot of money fixing issues as they arose so keep that in mind. Either way go with your gut."
CafeRacers,39zuil,floatate,0,Tue Jun 16 03:41:20 2015 UTC,Go standard instead of custom. The seat pan is hard to work with.
CafeRacers,39xpwg,Radio_ron,2,Mon Jun 15 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"Go to xjbikes.com, get a service manual, and you should be good to go. Get your bike in good shape mechanically first and go from there.   I rebuilt the exact same bike a few summers ago- I wanted to chop it initially too but then fell in love with what she became and don't want to stop riding to chop it (maybe I will in the future when I pick up a second bike). I did a bunch of smaller mods though which I think cumulatively really made a difference, like lowering the front, lowered headlight and gauge cluster, raised rear with new shocks, shorter bars (clubman's without rearsets on this bike are super uncomfortable, so now I've got some euro bends), and redid the tail assy because it's gigantic and ugly. New paint to get rid of the faded paint and rusty chrome and rebuilt brakes/ carbs/ clutch/ front forks and this bike is a blast to ride."

CafeRacers,39xpwg,Alex_Sol,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:28:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks! With all the paint, the most important thing is prep. The engine has a layer of clear over the aluminum that i first removed with paint stripper and a dremel with wire wheels and then I used really thin layers of VHT engine paint. If you don't use thin layers it'll leave a texture that you dont want. After you strip the clear you can polish the metal instead  Edit: don't be put off not having wrenched on bikes before. I hadn't either, and it was an amazing learning experience. There are tons of resources out there to help you!"
CafeRacers,39xpwg,356afan,2,Mon Jun 15 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"I had an XJ650 a few years ago that I was slowly turning into a bobber. When I got to the seat part, I got a good offer on the bike so I just sold it. I did a few changes on the bike:   flipped the handlebars upside down changed mirrors painted the tank flat black added pods instead of airbox added 4-1 Mac exhaust  dynojet for the carbs so it works well with new exhaust and pods rear-to- front wheel conversion  ... and a few others things that I'm forgetting.   A few weeks ago I picked up a Canadian 1984 XJ750 (same as '83) and I had some thoughts of converting it into a cafe racer, however my biggest issue is that I like square'ish tanks on the cafe racers and the stock tank is too round. I've been looking for a more cafe-style tank to put on the bike but it seems really really hard because of the geometry of Maxim's frame...  However, the seat shouldn't be hard to find and to install.  Anyway, here is the shot of my old 650 before I sold it.  http://i.imgur.com/hg7zAfg.jpg"

CafeRacers,39s2nt,pexorx,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:16:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, I recently bought my first bike - an 82 Honda CM450c. The carbs started pouring fuel about a month ago, and rather than take it into the shop, I decided to try and fix it myself. I took those carbs off the bike probably 4 times, cleaning, rebuilding and running every possible test I could think of. After checking every possible carb issue and resealing my rusty tank, it ended up being that my petcock wasn't air-tight and was ruining the vacuum.  All that to say, I've just been through carb bootcamp (for this model of bike at least), and am happy to chat through what I've learned. I'm no mechanic, but it's very fresh in my mind. Message me if you want to talk carbs and pods.  P.S. I keep reading and hearing things not running pods and going back to the factory air box. I've switched from moxi pods to Uni pods, and I didn't have to change my jets or play with my mixture at all.   These bikes have character, and what doesn't work for someone else's CM450 may work beautifully for yours. A lot of alterations can happen over 30 years."

CafeRacers,39lnto,GagNasty,3,Fri Jun 12 16:55:02 2015 UTC,What a beauty!
CafeRacers,39lnto,bmo111,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:17:47 2015 UTC,Thanks!
CafeRacers,39lnto,356afan,3,Fri Jun 12 17:28:18 2015 UTC,nice and simple...
CafeRacers,39lnto,jdd32,2,Fri Jun 12 18:26:41 2015 UTC,Clean as hell!
CafeRacers,39lnto,I_jus_lurk_here,2,Fri Jun 12 21:59:44 2015 UTC,Now that is a damn good looking bike. Matte black for dayyyys.
CafeRacers,39lnto,februarysnake,2,Sat Jun 13 01:00:49 2015 UTC,you mind me asking how much you put into it in order to make it that great looking?

CafeRacers,39lnto,slickpuss,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:28:20 2015 UTC,Under the seat!
CafeRacers,39lnto,NateTender,2,Mon Jun 22 04:14:57 2015 UTC,"I've one my self, my questions for you are: wheres/whats the Oil tank? what kind of Rear Fender? whered you get that taillight, and any more pictures?  edit: and are those hagons on the rear? and whats your attachment method for the seat?  thanks"
CafeRacers,39lnto,liesthroughhisteeth,2,Sat Jun 13 08:49:01 2015 UTC,Out of all the cafés on ig reddit and other café forums this is my favorite.
CafeRacers,39od9b,I_jus_lurk_here,4,Sat Jun 13 05:30:32 2015 UTC,"If you want a newer bike, I'd go for the Triumph (whether you like the Bonnie, Thruxton, or Scrambler - they're all pretty much the same bike). I've heard more than once that Triumph doesn't have great customer support, but having a dealer nearby might alleviate that. Otherwise, they are solid bikes with great build quality and liveliness. I guarantee you the negative reviews you're seeing are by guys who are used to riding high-end modern bikes. As a beginner, the Triumph is going to be fantastic."
CafeRacers,39od9b,ZeroG,3,Sat Jun 13 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Buy something that runs. Bring a comp tester for the buy (cheap on Ali express). Ride it, switch handle bars, rearsets. Get a feel for it, then: angle grinder and welder.  All the know how  is on Google, all the stuff you need is on eBay, Craigslist or Ali express."
CafeRacers,39od9b,pexorx,3,Sat Jun 13 10:28:34 2015 UTC,"Look at the Kawasaki Vulcan S, it's based off their 650 twin so the motor is dead reliable, been around for 10 years. They have designed it to be modded for different riding styles and people sizes, I thought that was pretty neat and they look good in person.  The Triumph's are good bikes that you can mod for better brakes and suspension just look at you tube for other people mods or bike specific forums.  I would not buy a RE unless you want that authentic british bike ride from 50 years ago. You will bite your ass if you ride a modern bike then a RE.  What ever you get try to get ABS on the bike as low-siding the front end is a common mistake for new riders when they get surprised or over correct in the wet"
CafeRacers,39od9b,GrayMountainRider,3,Sat Jun 13 21:08:37 2015 UTC,"www.rycamotors.com  Check these guys out! I'm building a CS-1 right now and totally love it. As soon as I finish the gas tank, I'm on the road!"
CafeRacers,39od9b,356afan,2,Sun Jun 14 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Just did quite a bit of reading on this and it seems almost too good to be true!  How has your experience been so far?  Could you kinda walk me through the process you used to where you are now?  What bike did you source, was it easy to find? What are the good/bad/uglies of doing it this way?  How is the quality of the parts/how would you rate their turnaround on tanks/customer service?  The point I'm at now, I could probably barely identify most of the parts on a bike, however, I have done a decent amount of engine work on cars....do you think I'll be able to follow the instructions easy enough (without doing terrible un-reversible) frame damage that will kill the build?  The seat post cuts kind of make me nervous since a little too much and you basically are out a frame.  Honestly, for 4ish thousand this seems like a good fit, then jumping over to maybe a triumph or a bigger project bike."
CafeRacers,39od9b,356afan,2,Mon Jun 15 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest, you need to download the instructions they made, watch their build videos, talk to the guys over at www.suzukisavage.com then reread the instructions, rewatch the videos, buy the Clymer owner's manual and ask a lot of questions! The build is based around the Suzuki Savage, also known as the Boulevard S40. Finding a bike is as easy as Craigslist. Mine was a low miles one owner, 20 minutes from my house. The build is pretty straightforward. I suggest getting the best bike you can. Low milage is better or else you'll need to do some engine mods with the valve chain adjuster. The chain stretches after several thousand miles and the tensioner can extend too far and cause a ""little"" engine damage. I'm about done with my build; just have to finish the bondo and sealing of the tank. They do a nice job on the tanks but expect to do some bondo as the metal is 22ga and does warp a little. The frame cuts seem nerve wracking but are very easy to do. Just do what they say and it's all good. Just as long as you don't cut the rear seat mounts off, you're fine. One of the hardest things was getting the fork caps back on! The whole project can be as simple as bolting it together but if you want to make your own mods, then welding comes into play. The glue that holds the taillight and side covers on works, but many of the builders make custom brackets for them. The Suzuki isn't a screamer but is quite torquey. You could do the ton with a few engine mods and a decent tailwind, but it's much better as a spirited cafe racer. Watch the episode of Jay Leno's garage where he rides one; good insight."
CafeRacers,39n0k4,Kyu-Don,5,Fri Jun 12 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"Like this?  The blue part would ideally be fiberglass or similar and easy to snap on and off. You'll likely hide a battery back there, or tool kit or brass knuckles or a sandwich."
CafeRacers,39n0k4,domirillo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:35:00 2015 UTC,I like this mock-up. What kind of bike is this from?
CafeRacers,39n0k4,ZeroG,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:33:50 2015 UTC,The issue is to make the shape and then use fiberglass to create the seat.
CafeRacers,39n0k4,pexorx,3,Sat Jun 13 06:08:35 2015 UTC,It would be easier to give suggestions if the tank was in place.
CafeRacers,39n0k4,pexorx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:36:03 2015 UTC,http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iQGScyFPI-w/maxresdefault.jpg  the bike center is straight line only the tail section have a curve...
CafeRacers,39n0k4,pexorx,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:10:48 2015 UTC,Think i would raise the saddle position and/or lower the tank if it's possible.
CafeRacers,39n0k4,356afan,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:13:36 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/rr297qU  I had to raise and flatten mine a bit.

CafeRacers,39izrs,fancysauce18,6,Fri Jun 12 01:30:26 2015 UTC,"Please no hump. Brat style seat would look great with that benelli tank, or a very small hump"
CafeRacers,39izrs,Skyline7818,3,Fri Jun 12 01:40:14 2015 UTC,"Humps have their place. I feel that it is very difficult for the home-brew build to pull it off, but a Brat-style with a slight curl, like so, is a nice medium. I've seen steel, fiberglass, and even a freaking skateboard deck work perfectly for this. The real key is a good upholsterer using a suitable material. Looks aren't everything. A close color may wear and last better than the perfect color."
CafeRacers,39izrs,wrongwayislost77,2,Fri Jun 12 03:57:24 2015 UTC,Hump should echo rear curve of tank to look right.
CafeRacers,39izrs,JimmyHavok,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:43:26 2015 UTC,"Hump is fine, it just needs to echo the same graceful lines of the tank."
CafeRacers,39izrs,Madmusk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:25:50 2015 UTC,I agree
CafeRacers,39izrs,Skyline7818,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:06:02 2015 UTC,This hump was just an experiment. But I'm going upholstery a leather laced seat with no hump. I'll leave it to the end to consider for room and electronics.
CafeRacers,39izrs,Skyline7818,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:36:26 2015 UTC,You can make a small tray underneath. I did that with mine
CafeRacers,39izrs,Skyline7818,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:05:14 2015 UTC,The triangle you see is the location for the battery tray. It's mesh steel on both sides.

CafeRacers,39izrs,iamasandwhich,4,Fri Jun 12 01:32:57 2015 UTC,"That tank is begging for a seat with no hump, or with just a small hump."
CafeRacers,39izrs,iamasandwhich,3,Fri Jun 12 01:34:26 2015 UTC,Lift the front of that Benelli tank and level out that line. That'll solve a lot of aesthetic woes here.
CafeRacers,39izrs,LockeClone,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"The tank doesn't look level because the bikes on the center stand. It still has a small tilt, but pretty much levels out when its on the wheels."
