HunterXHunter,3e4yft,bleachx4,12,Wed Jul 22 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"He definitely loved her. I mean, he wanted to spend his last living moments with her alone. Now was that love romantic? That's a bit more open to interpretation - personally I think their bond was deeper than friendship but maybe not enough to be called romance.  Their story is extremely moving either way."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,lilapollo,10,Wed Jul 22 00:21:29 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, they were very obviously in love. A lot of people like to argue semantics and whatnot, but the way I see it is that they loved each other as would any everyday romantic couple would. By the time of their deaths, at least."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,ultibman5000,6,Wed Jul 22 00:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think he did love her romantically, but not sexually. One of Komugi's lines to Meruem is often used by Japanese brides, and she was willing to die with him so I personally believe that at least she saw it romantically to some degree."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,Gearfire,4,Wed Jul 22 01:06:59 2015 UTC,"I think he did love her romantically, but not sexually.   I just thought of a image I can not unseen. Thanks"

HunterXHunter,3e4yft,Gearfire,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:30:05 2015 UTC,I think it really depends on your definition of love and romance. Personally I don't think romance is needed to feel love.  Edit: words.
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,Brook420,2,Wed Jul 22 02:48:29 2015 UTC,"I don't either, but in their case I believe both were present."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,Gearfire,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:02:10 2015 UTC,"Of course we're both free to interpret it differently, but I personally saw nothing but a platonic love between them based on respect."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,Brook420,6,Wed Jul 22 03:06:08 2015 UTC,No. I think what they felt was stronger than romance.
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,KurapikaKurta,3,Wed Jul 22 01:30:52 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in love with them as a couple, though I'm aware that it's a pairing very much based on the old Beauty and the Beast trope found in a buttload of fairy tales."
HunterXHunter,3e4yft,wanderingscribe,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"I dont really think meruem loved komugi in that way . I think meruem just admires , respects and loves her sweet and humble character along her strong resolve"

HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,PrettyShittyUser,12,Tue Jul 21 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"what is hunter x hunter 1999?   There is another version of the Hunter x Hunter anime which was made in 1999, but only has 92 episodes (the anime ends at the end of the Greed Island Arc).   It's not as true to the manga like 2011 version is. It's filled with Filler and this sub is currently doing a rewatch of the 1999 version, so feel free to join us on that.    And also is hunter x hunter actually coming back.   we have no idea. Maybe in 10+ years. Togashi (creator of HxH) is in terrible health, so we must wait until he's 100% again in order to produce more content.     Want more HxH?   You could read the manga of HxH on KissManga, mangapark, or bato There's two HxH movies which are not canon to the storyline.     The Phantom Rouge Movie - Which can be watched at animeultima, animefreak, animerush, or animecenter The Last Mission - which can be watch at kissanime or watchanimemovie    You can join us in the rewatch of the 1999 version of HxH. Every Monday, a livestream will be up at 4P.M EST sharp to watch the episodes."
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,Di_Bello,8,Tue Jul 21 18:39:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome!... to the great wait!  We all want more HxH but unfortunately the series is on indefinite hiatus as far as I know.  If the hiatus ends tomorrow it will probably be some time until the anime continues, that is if Madhouse decides to continue the series.  You're in it for the long haul now, son. This thread holds a collection of interviews with Togashi which I think are worth a read.  The 1999 series is the first anime adaptation of the manga, and it is also very good!  It has a slightly different tone than the 2011 and it is great fun to see another representation of the story.  Some of us are currently participating in a rewatch of the 1999 version.  After watching the episodes for the week you can join the discussion!  More info here! And the first discussion thread here!  Eventually HxH will rise from the morgue of hiatus but nobody knows exactly when it will be.  Togashi takes his time with writing due to many reasons: health, family, monetary independence, etc.  He also created YuYu Hakasho which was a massive hit (and his wife created Sailor Moon), so he has already experienced the stressful lifestyle of weekly content creation, not to mention everything else that comes with writing a famous manga series.  I recently read a short excerpt that he wrote a while back in which he talked about all of this stuff, but regrettably I cannot find it.  If anybody knows what I am referring to could you please link it?  Mainly I suppose Togashi is just enjoying the little detours in life.  I just finished my second watch of the 2011 series and I am starting to read through the manga, as well as watching a few 1999 when I get the chance.  I love this series, and I find myself browsing this subreddit more and more.  Fortunately, even despite the hiatus, the fans on this sub continually support HxH by keeping the sub active, positive, and fun.  The series is so good new topics and conversations spring up all the time!  It's fantastic."
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,yespadrille,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:19 2015 UTC,His wife created Sailor Moon?!?!?!?!? WHATTTTTT  Are their children gods?
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,glasscalendar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:53:42 2015 UTC,"Not yet, he is in a quest to beat Akira Toriyama to be one of the gods. If you read the manga, you'd know his marriage announcement including his child."
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,ImpedingMadness,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think Togashi would be that comparable to Toriyama. I mean the difference between the two is way too big to compare them, Togashi is just many, many levels above on characterization and storytelling. Even YYH, being a completely inferior work to HxH was still better than DBZ. Toriyama was pretty good with the comedy at his peak, with Dragon Ball, but that's about it."
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,Kamyu03,4,Wed Jul 22 03:18:42 2015 UTC,"Hunter x Hunter 1999 is an earlier anime adaptation that only covered throughout the Greed Island Arc (if the OVAs count, I guess). There's more filler in it, but a lot of people say that it adapted the Hunter Exam arc better than the 2011 version. The Hunter x Hunter manga is currently on hiatus, but there are about ten more chapters worth of material that extend beyond where the anime finished, and it's currently on an entirely new arc."

It's different for sure, but it's been tying me over well. Previously I had no interest in the series, but after watching a few episodes I was hooked. Just a suggestion."
HunterXHunter,3e3lrw,the_long,3,Tue Jul 21 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"You should watch Togashi's other anime, Yu Yu Hakusho.  YYH is a great anime, with interesting characters and story and has a ton of episodes, so you'll be busy for a while.  There's a lot of similarities between the two animes as well, so if you loved HxH odds are you're going to like YYH as well."

HunterXHunter,3e26j9,ramfield,3,Tue Jul 21 19:25:54 2015 UTC,Don't be so hard on him. The latest chapters have all been top notch.
HunterXHunter,3e26j9,Kitegi,8,Tue Jul 21 19:54:43 2015 UTC,Apparently he doesn't even use assistants. Can't really imagine him doing something like that.  I just wish he would write the whole story as a novel and hand it to MadHouse to adapt.

Most people I've come across that dislike Melody also dislike Kurapika and their dislike for Melody stems from their dislike of Kurapika. Some people do not like Kurapika for being too ""angsty"" and they feel that Melody's character only accentuates that part of Kurapika and therefore they dislike her for that reason. I do not necessarily feel that way, but that is the most common complaint I've seen of Melody's character. However even this isn't based on too many examples, because the amount of times people talk about Melody in the first place are severely limited."

But it may be different for different ants. The king may only live for a short period because his primary purpose is for reproduction (I think at least, my memory is blurry on this).  As for being stronger than Mereum, I doubt it. Mereum came out of the womb like a beast. They barely found Kite since he was a tiny fetus."

I assumed that it was because Pitou's persona was always more apathetically animalistic while Pouf's was actually malevolent and cruel - as this explanation points out.    I hadn't thought about the fact that Pouf's hatred for Komugi was mixed into his En. That probably made it sooo much worse. All I can say is poor Knov!
HunterXHunter,3e0o59,lilapollo,4,Tue Jul 21 02:36:18 2015 UTC,I think him being using Zetsu was a bigger part than Pouf's hatred for Komugi showing in his En. But both probably made for a terrible mixture.
HunterXHunter,3e0o59,iKsaGAM3R,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:26 2015 UTC,But what about when Knuckle and Meleoron encounter the king's en when they try to hide amongst the crowd of people? They were also in Zetsu and I'm sure the king's en was much more powerful.
HunterXHunter,3e0o59,jedimasterclos,9,Tue Jul 21 05:08:45 2015 UTC,i don't think it has to do with power levels. More on texture and nature of the Nen. Pouf's nen is most likely more despicable and crueler to the human psyche.
HunterXHunter,3e0o59,IAmUnanimousInThat,3,Tue Jul 21 05:21:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, you can feel both the malice and the power. The King had no malice at all while Poufs emotions are always all over the place..."
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,KieferIrvine,7,Tue Jul 21 04:17:31 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. I personally believe he will remain an Enhancer. I do think with the time off with not being able to use Nen and being forced to study by Mito, he will end up being much more intelligent the next time we see him, like Ging, and most likely evolve his Jajanken if he gets his Nen back and it remains as Enhancement."
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,jikirga,2,Tue Jul 21 04:25:25 2015 UTC,He just needs to speed up his charge time for Jajanken and it becomes a really good power.
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,MoonMan75,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, that may be the last step to perfecting Jajanken; but in between that point and now, Gon can't even train his control over Nen to achieve that. So basically what I'm saying is that, when we see him finally get his Nen back, I'm hoping he will be much more intelligent and be capable of creating genius tactics on the spot to hit someone with Jajanken, even if it does take a long time to charge up."
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,jikirga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:52 2015 UTC,Emitter would be a good switch up
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,Natsu_Firefox,4,Wed Jul 22 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"It'd be interesting to see him become a Specialist, but it's hard to say."
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,Blade-X,5,Tue Jul 21 08:47:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's certainly reasonable for him to switch to specialist! He certainly had a unique life experience!  As for the Jajanken, he could keep it or invent something new.   Since he's basically starting over, it's all up in the air. Though if he doesn't become a specialist, he'll definitely still be an enhancer. I think the typing is set from... some time in development and stays that way(with the exception of specialist)."
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,Virilitaas,3,Tue Jul 21 10:28:18 2015 UTC,"Jajanken is pretty cool for him actually. The unpredictability and diversity it presents for the enemy; rock, paper, or scissors, suits his fighting style, that is to adapt mid - fight. When he develops it, rock can be like Uvo's, scissors like Nobunaga's  Quick Draw or paper like Ging's"
HunterXHunter,3e17pf,DlikeScottie,3,Tue Jul 21 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"Jajanken is a great ability which suits him perfectly, so I doubt he will ignore it. He also has the option of creating abilities based on his affinity for nature. I'll give a few examples.  • Wild Animal: (enhancer ability) Gon directs aura into his nose and ears to vastly improve his senses.  • Avian Allies: (emitter ability) Gon separated the aura from his body to form numerous birds which will do his bidding. The birds cannot be used to attack but will instead attempt to distract and annoy the opponent (they are capable of basic speech like APR) , allowing Gon to land a Jajanken rock. They can be used for other purposes such as delivering messages and keeping Gon company. The restriction is that the birds will dissolve after a while.  • Bark Shield: (transmuter abillity) Gon transmutes a sturdy shield of wood to block attacks. Letting go of the shield will cause it to dissolve into aura."
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,KamakaziJanabi,5,Tue Jul 21 06:50:54 2015 UTC,I figure I have a good 60 years left till I die; I'm sure I'll see it end someday.
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,jikirga,6,Tue Jul 21 08:16:31 2015 UTC,"yeah you do, but what about togashi? heh"
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,Rerenan,2,Tue Jul 21 09:17:28 2015 UTC,My family has a history of diseases so I probably only have 30-45 years left to live. I'll probably see Hunter X Hunter continue and maybe end but I might not be able to live to see Hunter X Hunter 2050.
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,ChuckBronze,4,Tue Jul 21 16:07:31 2015 UTC,I just wish he'd get other people to do the art.
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,DoubleHunter,5,Tue Jul 21 09:59:39 2015 UTC,if these breaks didnt happen there would be 800 chapters........
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,Gearfire,2,Tue Jul 21 11:28:54 2015 UTC,He'll never do it.
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,DoubleHunter,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much the thing I've given up hope on."
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,Gearfire,5,Tue Jul 21 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"Whether he's consistent at it or not, Togashi is a mangaka because he wants to be one. That includes both drawing and story writing. At this point he does Hunter x Hunter for himself more than anyone else. I think to him it's more along the lines of a hobby than a career."
HunterXHunter,3e1lyi,youkaime,4,Tue Jul 21 15:44:23 2015 UTC,"I think everyones like, if it appears, awesome; if not, ah well.  One day."

HunterXHunter,3dzkva,Zoro_threeswordstyle,47,Mon Jul 20 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's more realistic though. They all have different goals. It'll take too long to accomplish everyone's goals if they're always together in the same place because Kurapika for example wants to get his family's eyes and avenge his family. How is he going to do that if he spends his time trying to help Gon find his dad? Vise versa for Gon.  Of course they can still get together sometimes depending on the situation. Thus how they met up in York New, but not because they planned it that way. It just worked out like that."
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,KurapikaKurta,9,Mon Jul 20 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, plus i think if they had sticked together it would be too much of the shounen group clichè. HxH doesn't do clichès... most of the time."
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,smileistheway,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:06 2015 UTC,A bit hard for Leorio to study for med school while getting chased by chimera ants or being inside a virtual video game too
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,MoonMan75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:20:33 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to at least touch on them. We got that little bit where the Boss's daughter lost her powers, but that was it. I really wanna see Leorio and how far he has progressed in his work and training"
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,fuzzypyrocat,12,Tue Jul 21 00:39:14 2015 UTC,I kind of agree because I liked them better as a group rather than just Gon and Killua but both Leorio and Kurapika have their own goals while Killua doesn't really have any goals of his own (until the Election Arc where he separates from Gon and takes care of Alluka) which is why he sticks with Gon. They will probably be a group again in the Arc after the DC if Togashi comes back.
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,EyesThatStare,3,Mon Jul 20 20:39:45 2015 UTC,Dont hold your breathe
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,JoeyPantz,9,Mon Jul 20 22:42:25 2015 UTC,The story would become really generic if the author was forced to always keep them together.. I agree it would be nice to get them all in a room together to see their interaction though.  Kurapika's been a real douche lately & would probably fuck up the atmosphere brooding..
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,rewoplliw,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:33 2015 UTC,Whats up with kurapika at the end of the anime though why is he not picking up any phonecall? also it seems like hes still wearing tuxedo which means hes still working with the mafia? but we all know neon nostrade is already incapable of fortune telling meanwhile shes the only gold mine of the family.

HunterXHunter,3dzkva,ChuckBronze,5,Mon Jul 20 22:15:08 2015 UTC,Kurapika was the main focus for the first few episodes of the Yorkshin City Arc.
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,Real_Velour,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:01 2015 UTC,It was like 10 or 12 eps wasn't it?
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,ChuckBronze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:45 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely sure but that sounds about right.
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,lilapollo,5,Mon Jul 20 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"I like them better together too... but it is way more practical for them to part ways. Real life works the same way, you can't always be with the same group of friends all the time.   That said, I would love it if they all reunited at some point in the manga. When they spend so much time apart it really makes you enjoy and appreciate the time they spend together."
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,tehftw,8,Mon Jul 20 21:30:54 2015 UTC,That's because Kurapika is way too awesome.
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,IAmUnanimousInThat,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:21 2015 UTC,I feel like them not being together all the time makes one appreciate it when they are together.   Also it's more genuine and adds conflict.
HunterXHunter,3dzkva,AniMoney,2,Tue Jul 21 02:12:10 2015 UTC,"Togashi doesn't really follow a lot of shonen tropes or narratives. In a lot of other shows the main characters would always be together and have some big common goal, or atleast have goals that closely align and cause them to party up long-term.  But HxX doesn't follow the typical shonen chiches, it's one of the things I really like about it. I'm sure we'll see the gang all together again if/when Togashi continues the story."

HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,MystTale,17,Mon Jul 20 19:34:12 2015 UTC,The other option is that he truly is strong enough to take on the likes of Netero and isn't presumptuous when challenging all these extremely strong foes. I do think he will meet his end going up against Chrollo or Gon in the future though.
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,jikirga,13,Mon Jul 20 19:50:52 2015 UTC,And the other other option is that Togashi never finishes... :(
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,almightyjebus99,4,Mon Jul 20 20:09:38 2015 UTC,i honestly would hate if the series is done i really wanted to see how the manga arc would pan out

HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,Zoro_threeswordstyle,3,Mon Jul 20 20:20:53 2015 UTC,"The series continuation really depends on if Togashi can be bothered to make time for it. He really has no obligation to ever finish it, unfortunately."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,UnwiseSudai,4,Mon Jul 20 22:11:58 2015 UTC,Have we EVER seen Hisoka have any issues with any of his enemies?  I can't remember a time he wasn't toying around or just out right dominating his opponents.  He may really be that strong.
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,jyunga,3,Mon Jul 20 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, he showed some difficulty when catching Razor's ball in Greed Island."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,HellFireOmega,5,Mon Jul 20 22:08:32 2015 UTC,"But he had conditions put on him by the game they were playing. Had Razor and Hisoka fought a true battle, he likely would have completely avoided Razor's ball."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,Haste_The_Day_,3,Tue Jul 21 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"If it was a proper fight, Hisoka wouldn't be trying to catch it. It just proves that he doesn't want to get hit by a full power enhancer technique. Not many people do."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,PrimalPower,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:11:23 2015 UTC,Razor's ball is an emitter attack.
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,jikirga,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:31 2015 UTC,"The reason I like Hisoka, though he's a strong fighter and a strong nen user compared to the average hunter, is that I never thought he matched the strength of powerful nen users such as Netero.   Hisoka's power comes from his incredible creativity and adaptability with bungee gum. We get a taste of this creativity in his fight vs. Gon and Gotoh.   I imagine that Hisoka fighting at his peak is not a match of nen or strength, but rather a fight where he's put in an incredibly complex position with his bungee gum where his mind and reflexes are constantly are put to the brim."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,Zoro_threeswordstyle,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, being an ingenious fighter that reacts to different situations on the fly may very well be Hisoka's game even by the end, instead of just being an overpowering force like Netero or  Chrollo (assuming he has powerful abilities hidden away in his Bandit's Secret). When I said he may be ""strong enough to take on the likes of Netero,"" I mostly meant he may be a capable enough fighter to go toe to toe with him."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,lilapollo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:39:22 2015 UTC,Gon vs Hisoka has been hyped forever. If you count heavens arena when hisoka was clearly stronger than gon by quite a bit i guess you could say it happened. however down the road of this story we have seen how hisoka is itching to fight someone extremely strong. Enough of my blabbering though ill make a list of potential hisoka fights   Illumi  Gon Killua  Chrollo  Ging  Zeno or Silva  perhaps feitan if he cant fight chrollo
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,lilapollo,9,Mon Jul 20 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"I also think Hisoka will die in some sort of battle. For him, it would be the best way to go.  For some inexplicable reason I just cannot see Hisoka living until old age. (Old man Hisoka just doesn't have the same swag, you know?)"

Him dying against Gon or Chrollo seems too predictable imo.  I've always always thought he'd actually die protecting Gon in like a last stand against multiple people."
HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,LucasArsenal,3,Mon Jul 20 23:54:16 2015 UTC,"I like that last idea  Gon/phantom troupe/hiskoa/the rest of the crew head to DC, all of a sudden Gon and crew gets surrounded and threatened by some other force(s), hisoka goes HAM bc they are trying to take his toys from him, goes full on bloodlust basically defending them while the crew makes an escape, hisoka dies finally, but only after taking down a shit ton of enemies"

HunterXHunter,3dzd8b,TopGildedWiki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the point I'm making is that his power is irrelevant. In HxH All it takes is one careless mistake to cost you your life. This might happen to Hisoka if he gets a bit too excited during a fight, and loses his ability to think rationally."
HunterXHunter,3e0f65,rewoplliw,3,Tue Jul 21 00:16:10 2015 UTC,"I don't mind it as long as Togashi manages to handle it differently, which from the looks of it he already is. Mitsutoshi hasn't taken that much from Hunter x Hunter. The biggest thing was the concept of the Gourmet Hunters, but Togashi hardly did anything with it in the first place so it's not that bad. I still consider the Uchiha Clan the most blatant ripoff."
HunterXHunter,3e0f65,Gearfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:16 2015 UTC,I believe the first chapter of Toriko was a ripoff with the fishing & Toriko being in a port town to sell the fish. Also the gourmet towers is a carbon copy of heavens arena but that's all I can think of off top. As far as the DC goes I don't see what Togashi has handled different albeit we haven't gotten there yet.
HunterXHunter,3e0f65,Gearfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"Toriko was fishing in the first chapter, but for completely different reasons from Gon. At most I'd chalk it up to an homage, especially considering the events that take place right after are utterly different than what happens in Hunter x Hunter. I'd also agree with the Gourmet Towers, but again that's something pretty minor.  Togashi has brought in the danger of different kinds of lifeforms. Lifeforms made of gas, diseases, plant weapons, etc. It's plain to see that the types of dangers on the Dark Continent are different. The Dark Continent also seems to have less order. The Gourmet World's order is maintained by the 8 Kings, but so far there seems to be no such thing on the DC."
HunterXHunter,3e0f65,Gearfire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just being picky because I feel like the reason Togashi doesn't write alot, is because all the tropes he introduces are taken by different authors & packaged as a different deal.  An example is I tried to give Boku no Hero the other day & the powers system they introduced was a copy of nen I just think without the vows & limitatiions."
HunterXHunter,3e0f65,Gearfire,2,Tue Jul 21 03:09:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly  I doubt he cares to that extent. He's taken jabs at Mitsutoshi before in an interview, but I doubt he concerns himself with it all THAT much. Certainly not enough to do something like taking his hiatuses. Especially considering that he's not innocent of it himself. Anyone who's seen the Alien movies or Parasyte could tell you that quite a bit of inspiration for the Chimera Ant arc came from those two. As well Netero's ability is quite similar to a stand.  I think he's more bitter at Shounen Jump than other authors. Plus all the stuff that was taken was from the beginning of the story and not when he started to take hiatuses. I haven't seen someone do a blatant copy of any of the material in Greed Island or beyond."

HunterXHunter,3e0f65,ImpedingMadness,2,Tue Jul 21 03:22:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I guess I'm just don't generally see Togashi's hiatuses as complex as some people theorize them to be. To me Togashi is just a guy in a unique position that is well aware of the position he's in. He is a mangaka at heart and genuinely loves the work he does, but I feel he is now writing for himself more than either Shounen Jump or his fans. Therefore his content and the pace at which he provides it is happening in the way he wants it to be."

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Zoldyck666,23,Mon Jul 20 12:46:54 2015 UTC,"I want him to earn it this time, the meditation method. That would be a massive development for him, if he learned the patience needed to forge nen.   If the series ever continues, I 100% want to see Gon make his way to the forefront again. I mean, for sure he has to of changed somehow from the fight with Pitou, but this is his series, and he can't just watch from the sidelines, that would kill him."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,ntrotter11,7,Mon Jul 20 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I'd also like it if, because of his vow and how he re-obtains his nen, he got some new abilities instead of the Jajanken (or an ability based on the jajanken but taken in a new direction.)  And who knows? Maybe all the things he's been through will change which nen-type he has. (Though aside from specialist, I'm not sure which would make sense.)"
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,oddpotata,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"Jajanken is pretty cool for him actually. The unpredictability and diversity it presents for the enemy; rock, paper, or scissors, suits his fighting style, that is to adapt mid - fight. When he develops it, rock can be like Uvo's, scissors like Nobunaga's  Quick Draw or paper like Ging's"
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,DlikeScottie,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:39 2015 UTC,"Has he even ever used paper or scissors? I like the idea and simplicity of JaJanken, but if he's going to stay with ""punch hard with aura"" then the warmup time has got to go.  Unless whatever change he goes through (if any) is real deep, then I can't see him being anything but an enhancer."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,ntrotter11,4,Mon Jul 20 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah he used em, like once. Scissors is a sword, paper was a projectile I think... I am not sure."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,SwordPorygon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:24 2015 UTC,"I know their uses, I just can't recall him ever actually using them. I want to say he used paper on Greed Island, but I don't remember."

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,oddpotata,2,Mon Jul 20 23:38:38 2015 UTC,I want Gon to be out of the arc and that he needs an item from the dark continent in order to get his Nen back

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,ntrotter11,16,Tue Jul 21 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"Firstly, please spoiler tag it as Manga spoilers  These are extremely difficult questions to me. On the one hand, I want him to stay the protagonist as I can not imagine him staying it without nen. Also, I have never witnessed an anime/manga, in which the protagonist was degraded in to a spectator or something similar. I don´t know how to feel if Togashi really would decide him to stay powerless.   On the other hand, Gon should somewhat pay for his vow. Getting literally everything back after he ""gave up everything"", would be really cheap in terms of storytelling. Such a decision should have a significant impact to move the story forward. If he gets it back, no matter how, everything stays in the status quo and his fight with Pitou feels less epic/dramatic.   This is really a hard choice for Togashi. No matter what he does, he will certainly piss of a lot of people.   As for how, I don´t really care, since it most probably doesn´t matter, unless something major happens in return."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,BBallHunter,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:10 2015 UTC,I don't mind Gon become a spectator. Time for Kurapika and Leorio to shine since they absent in the last 2 arcs.
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Shiki_Ryougi,5,Mon Jul 20 15:09:47 2015 UTC,I dont think they have the potential for the level of appeal that Gon has tho. His blind innocence with his equally as blind loyalty made him really likable.
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,testreker,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:43 2015 UTC,you mean like how Uryu Ishida in Bleach regained his powers by getting shot?

Hopefully this isn't a spoiler for you, but FMAB  On the topic at hand, I completely agree with both of your points.  It would be difficult for Gon to be the protagonist without his nen, especially since I feel like his nen helped exacerbate the darker aspects of his personality.  However, I also don't want him to get his nen ""handed back to him.""   Such a decision should have a significant impact to move the story forward."

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,DoctorLeviathan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think he should have to re-learn use nen, like by doing it the first way wing explained, by opening the pores things yourself instead of the shock to your system that he gave to Gon and Killua."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,MrGommyBoy,8,Mon Jul 20 23:34:28 2015 UTC,I would love for Gon to get his Nen back. I think it would be cool if he went to Jappon and Hanzo helped him. It seemed like Hanzo was set up to have some importance at some point and we haven't seen much of him. He went to visit Gon in the hospital so I think he would be willing to help him out.
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,TenaciousPOD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:30 2015 UTC,He was also in Hisoka's toybox so the plot could also involve Hisoka :D
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,MonkeyDFreecs,3,Tue Jul 21 07:44:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't want Gon to suffer any ""too"" major consequences. (His critical-near-death conditions is enough), but mainly I want him to not be ""downgraded"", because I enjoy the series because of Gon and I genuinely want him to become powerful.   I wouldn't mind a short time skip, a year or two, and when Gon comes back perhaps he's back at his Chimera Ant Arc level.   I do think Togashi should use this time to focus other characters. The Dark Continent Arc seems to do this, where it completely shifts the focus onto Ging, the Zodiacs etc. And the break from the main cast is appreciated.   But ultimately, I got hooked onto Hunter x Hunter because I enjoyed Gon, Kurapika, Leorio, and Killua.   And although the Chimera Ant arc was well done, I'd rather have the series eventually return to being light-hearted with serious moments rather than serious with light-hearted moments.   Especially since the series is built like a shonen, I'd rather not be at a cliff-hanger of a serious moment at the end of every chapter/episode."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,PrimalPower,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"Its obvious, he will have to start learning fullbringer to replace his lost shiniga--- i mean, nen powers"

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,regready,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's a mental thing.  He's ashamed of what he did and became and he doesn't want to have Nen again, but he still has it he just ""can't see it"" and that's because he doesn't want to."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Virilitaas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"My assumption was this is where he was going to work in a timeskip.  Set up the dark continent, have others get into some stuff.

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,DoctorLeviathan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"Doubt Gon could save the day when it comes to the DC. The people going there are way stronger than Gon, so if they got in trouble there would be no way for Gon to help. He's probably going to just sit out during this arc."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Virilitaas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:02 2015 UTC,That's what the timeskip is for he could naturally age into his potential.

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Virilitaas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:22:57 2015 UTC,But wouldn't you prefer someone else taking the main role? If he got his Nen back it would probably the most predictable reason. (Someone he cares for dies) (He is fighting and losing and suddenly gets his nen back)
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Kamyu03,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:36 2015 UTC,Someone else? Have you not ever read a shonen manga? :D  The main char has to seem like all is lost so then when he eventually comes back it's even more impressive!

HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Kamyu03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"If the show switches to a different main character entirely that would seriously surprise me. It can easily focus on the side characters or multiple main characters easily, but Gon is the protagonist of the series. If he goes away, it'll only be so he can be brought back later."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Virilitaas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"We can't never know for sure. The series is already doing something no other shounen (or most series out there actually) has ever done before, with the main character being completely out of the picture for what's going to be the longest arc yet."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Kamyu03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:04 2015 UTC,It seems that way... I actually think the arc will just set up some big events and then fade out. Then it will timeskip and the four main heroes will assemble and head out to the DC and things will be drastically different for the people already in DC and the four main chars after a couple years of training.
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,Kamyu03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:30:35 2015 UTC,"That'd be very predictable and shounen-esque, thus i'm pretty sure it's not gonna happen. A time-skip again something that happens a lot in long running shounen just cause, so i don't see Togashi doing an actually significant timeskip in the series, he has never done one."
HunterXHunter,3dxuue,kirbin24,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's going to get his nen back, mainly because of his oath and restriction and cause i don't see Togashi bringing him back after his goal has already been achieved.  Gon was never a very interesting mc anyway, he felt too generic for a series like HxH in most arcs."
HunterXHunter,3dyuxi,lord_empty,12,Mon Jul 20 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"The fish actually came to him, because Ging had become friends with him and then just left. That's just the way Ging rolls."

HunterXHunter,3dyuxi,oetsuthebest,10,Tue Jul 21 00:34:02 2015 UTC,In the manga Gon just pulls up the Lord of the Lake with his own strength without all the theatrics done in the anime. I suppose you can explain what happened in the anime by saying his incredible leg drive when tossing himself off the branch and spinning himself around using the momentum pulled the Lord of the Lake out.  Ging probably just pulled it up normally like Gon did in the manga.
HunterXHunter,3dyuxi,jikirga,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:00 2015 UTC,"I was wondering if it was different in the manga. I liked the way they did it in the anime, adds a little realism to it and shows that Gon has amazing instincts."

HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,MystTale,7,Mon Jul 20 07:23:01 2015 UTC,I'd pay to see Kurapika's reaction if that happens.
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Pereeia,5,Mon Jul 20 12:42:32 2015 UTC,I could've see it happen during the Chimera Ant arc when Gon was totally mad but now it wouldn't make sense because he has learned from it and he's in a better mental state.
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Hieillua,2,Mon Jul 20 13:43:09 2015 UTC,"There's actually no indication that Gon has learnt from his near-death experience. He clearly regrets treating Killua like crap. However, if Killua were to be killed I doubt Gon would be able to stop himself from turning into a monster."
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,MystTale,4,Mon Jul 20 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"Togashi's pattern for HxH is that once a main character accomplishes their dreams (Leorio: Medicine, Kurapica: Revenge, Gon:Meet Father, Killua:Friend), they stop being main characters. In the anime, it's complete. I wished Togashi would focus on a completely new POV character outside of the four. Not Ging, just someone fresh and strange."
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Nez_Zai,4,Mon Jul 20 15:34:55 2015 UTC,But the thing is that gon and kilua both have new dreams and kurapica still has a long way to go before accomplishing theirs. So i rather like to stay with gon as the protagonist and put the focus back on the hunter part.
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Pomi12,4,Mon Jul 20 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"I see. For me, the one of the best things about HxH are the side characters."
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Nez_Zai,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"I think those are interesting but most of them (maybe except the Phantom troupe ,hisoka and maybe the zoldycks ) couldn't maintain a whole story maybe a small arc but nothing big. Thats what so great about hxh while we follow the main story we get the most of the side characters without overusing them."
HunterXHunter,3dx3o0,Pomi12,3,Mon Jul 20 16:32:53 2015 UTC,Gon will have a new goal soon. Remember when Ging told him to figure out what you want to do in life.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,KizaruTroll,76,Sun Jul 19 16:15:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Netero told the King that his subordinates probably already died fighting his Royal Guard. As you can tell, he probably didn't have much faith in them."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Miracle_man_,14,Sun Jul 19 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"maybe he just said that to make meruem fight . if his subordinates ""died"" , netero would be the only one that knows his name , that's how i took it"
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,oetsuthebest,18,Sun Jul 19 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he was telling the truth, however. I took it as a bluff."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,JohnSmiththeGamer,38,Sun Jul 19 17:43:31 2015 UTC,"Even if it was a bluff though, the sentiment was pretty accurate. The rest of the team was very close to being annihilated at several points. Hell most, if not all of them, would have ended up dead if Meleoron alone hadn't been there."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Gearfire,18,Sun Jul 19 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"It was probably both a bluff to make the King fight him and an honest guess. The job of Gon and the others was explicitly to keep the royal guards away from the King long enough for Netero to take care of him, not to kill them. They weren't expecting to defeat the guards from the beginning. Their survival wasn't really relevant to the plan, as evidenced by Knuckle's guilt towards saving Shoot.   Also, Netero was being excessively modest when he said he couldn't defeat Pitou. He couldn't match her aura and might not have been able to kill her before she decided to cut her losses and run, but she wouldn't have been able to touch him."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,WaldenX,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:53 2015 UTC,Netero even said there's going to be some sacrifices while he's inside NGO. The bomb would have gone off taking everybody with him but the situation turn out better.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,therealraptor,54,Sun Jul 19 19:55:33 2015 UTC,Netero must have figured out that Gon is the main character

HunterXHunter,3dug3j,TenaciousPOD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:05 2015 UTC,Or we can say that Netero saw Gon's Determination. Manga spoilers
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,hungryfood88,23,Tue Jul 21 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"I dont think netero cared that much about the royal guard. He just wanted the king alone. Once the king was dead the royal guard could be dealt with another bomb, netero could have sent a sub-par hunter with the bomb, but he just wanted to fight."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Texture_suprise,27,Sun Jul 19 16:43:03 2015 UTC,Another bomb wouldn't have even been required. If things got bad enough all the Zodiacs together could have probably killed one of the Royal Guards. The only reason the King needed to be dealt with so swiftly was because he was capable of mating and creating more and more queens which would overrun the world quite quickly.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Gearfire,8,Sun Jul 19 17:10:41 2015 UTC,I think the Zodiacs are stronger than that. Some of them like Ging could probably take a guard out alone.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,TxXxF,12,Sun Jul 19 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I'm just trying to hammer in the point that a leftover Royal Guard or two is not something that would require nuclear arms to alleviate. A group composed of highly skilled hunters and/or assassins could take out Youpi or Pitou without too many casualties. Ging might be able to handle one alone, but it'd be hard even on him and he most certainly wouldn't walk away without suffering some damage. A group would be more time and cost effective."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Gearfire,0,Sun Jul 19 18:50:14 2015 UTC,are u participing in the nen tournament
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Ddmaster123,3,Sun Jul 19 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"only one of the royal guard ? man , im pretty hyped about the zodiacs and i expect the to have been able to make it against all three of them . their nen ability is pretty dangerous and they seem to be able to keep calm in every possible danger . like for example the monkey one (dont remember the name) could take their sight and hear and the other ones finish the job . i see it quite possible , and i think that ging alone with someone else (like pariston) could kill a royal guard"
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,oetsuthebest,2,Sun Jul 19 18:56:02 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not saying they couldn't. My main point is that with people like the Zodiacs walking around, a lone Royal Guard is nothing to bother the World's militaries with or anything."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Gearfire,2,Sun Jul 19 18:59:58 2015 UTC,ah sorry man i didnt read your last comment
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,oetsuthebest,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:48 2015 UTC,The Royal Guard will lose all purpose and even the will to live if the King dies.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,therealraptor,25,Sun Jul 19 19:57:25 2015 UTC,Netero definitely could beat pitou. Did u see how far he knocked her back without even using his 100-type
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,dorkman75,31,Sun Jul 19 16:50:59 2015 UTC,and did zero damage to Pitou
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,yamobe,11,Sun Jul 19 16:57:30 2015 UTC,He literally bitch slapped her hundreds of feet and laughed at her.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,AngelComa,31,Sun Jul 19 23:29:16 2015 UTC,But his goal wasnt to damage pitou it was to get her out of the way
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,dorkman75,13,Sun Jul 19 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Zero damage because it was essentially one slap. If he could gradually cause dull sensations of pain in the king then IMO his hands alone could've killed her. Zero Palm for sure would've finished her. Youpi's shapeshifting and explosions might've caused Netero problems, but I imagine him to be slowest of all the guards."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,watchout4shredder,19,Sun Jul 19 20:12:38 2015 UTC,"From what is see, Netero can be pretty cruel. Like how he set up the Hunter exam final. He probably knows Gons character very well, and knew that if naive little Gon got really hurt emotionally, he could become a huge danger. We have had people say how much potential they have and even a person(Name forgotten, the guy who they learned Nen from.) mention that he might have created monsters. Netero might have known enough to foresee that happening, or maybe that a little buffed Gon and killia could handle it."

Netero taking him out to the wasteland served two purposes; the royal guards couldn't interfere with the fight, and should push come to shove, the bomb wouldn't kill the entire country's population gathered out front of the palace.  The other hunters were there in hopes of defeating the royal guard so that they would survive, but the essence of their role was purely distraction so that Netero could deal with the king.  Netero even mentions that the others likely died to the royal guards, which would be true if Youpi had continued to fight, Pouf did anything useful, or Pitou didn't comply with Gon / if Gon wasn't such a masochist. Though this was also partly a bluff in order to get the king to fight, as Netero would be the only one left that knows his name, so he couldn't learn it elsewhere."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,Nidies,5,Sun Jul 19 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"All netero wants is to fight the king. He's prepared to die, much like every other hunter there. Gon wants to kill pitou and is willing to risk death to do so. Netero would probably not be concerned about gons welfare, not because he doesn't care but because that would be considered condescending or an insult to gons resolve."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,tombrid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"on the other hand he may not care on a personal level at all and is just focused on isolating the king.  Netero probably had confidence in gons ability, or at least understood that he was capable of becoming as strong as he needed to be. He would also be aware that gon is gings son, whom netero considers one of the top 5 nen users in the world. As morel said i believe, the moment you start talking about who would win in a nen fight, you're wrong. I think he also said ""You must fight certain of victory, that is a nen fighters spirit"". I think this is kind of foreshadowing or at least a small insight into how netero must of felt."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,tombrid,4,Mon Jul 20 02:04:43 2015 UTC,He probably thought that all of the Royal Guards would come to the King and get poisoned.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,DoubleHunter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:26 2015 UTC,Maybe it was his way of offing Gon. He could have thought that Gon had to die because his immence potential had been corrupted by revenge. This is a long shot theory but if Gon were evil imagine the damage he could do as an adult. Netero probably knew that the outcome of their fight whould be Gon's death. He couldn't have predicted the existance Something though.
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,AmeriChris,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:30:17 2015 UTC,"YO! HEY LISTEN! Not sure which of the many relevant comments to put this on. But It seemed to me fairly clear that Netero could not beat pitou! Not at the moment he saw her. Hence why he stated so. In his old age he had not stored enough aura as he once would have had access to. But he definitely could beat pitou in a 1 v 1 fight, only he needed that preparation time. He went and meditated and prayed until the last minute AND called in a favour for a stealth lift, as he was storing energy to fight the king he would have surpassed her along the way. Evidence by how far he knocked her back without even using his 100-type and that the king eventually started to feel pain while using it. As for Gong's chances, Netero would know it wasn't impossible, at a terrible price (Fun to Netero). But mostly he was just as they all were, binds to stall and create alone time with the king... Most suicide.  They all were, which is ultimately why the Ants lost."
HunterXHunter,3dug3j,VanceRoland,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:36 2015 UTC,Does it matter?
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,dorkman75,2,Sun Jul 19 23:28:53 2015 UTC,I don't understand how people think that Ging is stronger than Pitou?
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,ChuckBronze,3,Mon Jul 20 01:07:05 2015 UTC,"I consider Pitou to be stronger than Ging, but I'd put my money on Ging in a fight between the two."
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,Gearfire,2,Mon Jul 20 05:10:42 2015 UTC,"People seem to misunderstand the top 5 nen users thing.  Ging is in the Top 5, but that's according to the Hunter Association. I'm sure this ranking doesn't have every Nen user in the HxH universe."
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,Di_Bello,3,Mon Jul 20 01:12:56 2015 UTC,It was according to Netero who is familiar with the elites outside the Hunter Association like the Zoldycks and Phantom Troupe.
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,jikirga,2,Mon Jul 20 01:15:11 2015 UTC,thanks for clearing it up.  But I still think Royal Guards and The King are the strongest people we've seen so far(excluding gon-san)
HunterXHunter,3dvuvw,Di_Bello,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:16 2015 UTC,Probably because of hype.
