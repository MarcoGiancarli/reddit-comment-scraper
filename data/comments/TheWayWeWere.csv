TheWayWeWere,3dtuld,ctyt,19,Sun Jul 19 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"Well, not the internet as you know it today, that's for sure. But the post didn't say there wasn't access to the internet until 1997.  It said ""by 1997"". I wrote that because of the date of the newspaper article and because he shut it down in 1997. He had an 800 number and 3 Gulf Coast dial-up phone numbers so people wouldn't have to pay long distance. He had a total of 13 lines running in that bedroom when he shut it down. The 13 lines were costing him $750 a month.   You could get internet before then if you had the know-how and money. But you had to dial long distance and wait forever to connect and tie up your phone line. It was very expensive. ATT&T and Bellsouth were selling internet before 1997, but back then it really wasn't the ""world wide web"" or the dot.com's you have today and  kids sure didn't want it.   There were other businesses selling the internet in 1995 in Mississippi and some got multiple dial-up numbers so you wouldn't have to pay long distance, but you could count them on one hand.  ""internet service provider"" was my modern term but it's not mentioned one time in the newspaper article. In the newspaper article, they had to explain what ""download"" meant.  And they still referred to his business as a ""board"".  But his business was up 24/7, there was never a busy signal, and he had to get a business license and pay taxes.   There were plenty of people running bulletin board systems before then. But they weren't selling and providing access to the internet like he was doing in the mid-90s and then later with the ""world wide web"".

There were still segregated units serving in the Korean War in 1950 (the all black 24th Infantry Reg, for example).  The 31st was a National Guard division from the South and although officially desegregated, I would think it would have taken a while for the division to be really desegregated.  That being said, prior to 1950, there were probably some smaller attached units that probably would have been all black, such as quartermaster or transportation companies.  This is a guess.  It is unfortunate that you weren't able to question him about this before his passing.  He lived through some interesting times in our nation's history."

After 2,300 Los Angeles Transit Lines streetcar and bus employees went on strike, the June 21, 1955, Los Angeles Times reported:   Traffic, thy name was jam yesterday, especially in the downtown area, as the Los Angeles Transit Lines were idled by strike.  Dep. Police Chief Harold Sullivan, in charge of the Traffic Bureau, estimated that an additional 100,000 automobiles were added to the normal downtown vehicular crush .…  Sullivan said traffic to downtown was up about 40%. With this increase in automobiles the usually grim parking problem became almost hopeless for thousands.  Entrances to downtown parking lots often were blocked by queues of motorists waiting their turns and these lines of idled cars disrupted traffic on most streets in the downtown area.  Almost choked by automobiles that are usually left home in garages by would-be riders, the lots were hard put to find room for the vehicles of later-arriving shoppers …."

Unless he's an usher at a wedding, how often does a teenage boy wear a dinner jacket? And proms today don't really seem to be taken seriously, but it was a VERY serious matter when they (and I) were that age. Your Senior Prom wasn't just another school dance, it was -- for most of us -- the first time you could act like an actual adult. Or how you thought an adult was supposed to act. It was a different time. Different things mattered."

Below is the transcript. I'm interested to find out how Isabel knew Madge. I knew neither.   Dear Madge ,  Did you know that I'm an old married woman? Whether such sensational news had leaked out or not I don't know- but I'll enclose a little memento or two which will prove it and show me to you in the before-and-after stages. Carter and I are very happy and are all settled down just as I'm sure you would expect us to be.   We went to Ohio to be married. Had intended to marry at home in Billings - but did you know too that I lost my dear father the last day of March? He died of a heart attack after a two-days illness. While we were all crushed and not at all ready to see him go we were glad that he did not have a protracted illness and was able to work and take care of his business practically to the end. He would have been 84 in June. Dick was in the army but was discharged and came home and took over the business immediately.   Well things were so changed at home that I couldn't bear the thought of marrying there. I had always wanted my uncle Ed (you've heard me talk doubtless of Aunt Jo and Uncle Ed) to marry me- so instead of having them (at the age of 75) come out here Carter and I decided to go there. Carol went with us and a cousin of mine from Chicago-and we found ourselves in the midst of my old college friends (I had gone to school only eleven miles from where Aunt Jo and Uncle Ed lives) and so we had a grand-time. Everybody was lovely to us gave us nice parties and we had quite a crowd at the wedding. The little church was really beautiful with (unknown) and Madonna lilies and we have only the happiest memories of everything connected with the wedding. We honey-mooned in Cincinnati, Lexington KY, and Nashville where I met hordes of Carter's relatives and we were royally entertained. We came back via Hot Springs- and while we looked back on a most delightful trip, it really seemed good to get back to Tulsa, get the wrinkles out of our clothes and sort of settle down. We kept my apartment because it is practically impossible to rent anything here and we consider ourselves lucky to be so conveniently located. It was beginning to get warm when we got home and has gradually increased in doing so and we are practically cooked now. You know this is my first summer in Tulsa and I didn't know the heat could be so terrific!   Enough about me- how about all your family? I so enjoyed the last news you sent -  Margaret James left about three weeks ago with her baby to join her husband in Peru. No news yet except of her arrival.   Drew(?) and I had dinner Tues night together and spent the evening (Carters Chamber of Commerce banquet). She is fine- hunting a place to live. Carter and I ran into Floy(?) in Hot Springs. She was there for the baths, has rather a bad case (I'm afraid) of arthritis. Card from her yesterday says she Is much improved and I'm so glad.   Haven't head from Anna Mae- stopped and said hello to Virginia in Bowling Green.   I'm going on with teaching- Have nice position and they urge me to keep it- think routine is better for me anyway-  And before we know it it will be time to begin!  Won't you ever come to Tulsa? If Carter and I ever drive to Dallas (we'd like to this fall) maybe we'll drop by. I'd love to see you all- John, MaryAnn and you. Can't imagine how you look! Drop me a line-   Lovingly, Isabel"

TheWayWeWere,3cwf89,sunset7766,11,Sat Jul 11 17:11:32 2015 UTC,"You may be interested in the history of ice houses.  Apparently the practice of getting ice from frozen bodies of water in the winter and storing them in ice houses to be delivered as needed throughout the year lasted until around the 1920s.  I knew that, which is why I searched for it in answer to your question. But I found an interesting fact near the end of that article I linked.   An employee of the Southland Ice company sold ice (of course) in his shops and supplemented the ice sales with milk, eggs, etc. His shops were open from 7AM to 11PM, and eventually when the market shifted completely from ice -- his shops were renamed 7-11!"

You pasted the stamps in these books they gave you and when you had enough, you took the books to a redemption center and picked out stuff like the chemistry sets, crappy guitars, lava lamps, all kinds of really low grade stuff, but as a kid I loved it.  I used to add pieces of Alka Seltzer to my chemistry experiments so they'd fizz like in the monster movies.  ""What's with all of these people being so nostalgic today?

That was more than enough room for them.  They sometimes would have visitors that would stay overnight or longer, so the kids would just give up their bedrooms and setup sleeping bags in the living room.    One couple I know always chooses to buy multi-story homes that are at least 2100 sq ft, even though they only have one child.  They rarely entertain or have visitors.  Two or more of their bedrooms are never even put to use.  In my case, a 1600 sq ft house, with a maximum of three bedrooms is all I require.  Big enough to entertain and have a guest sleep over.  Preferably a ranch style to make getting around easier, especially living with someone that is wheelchair dependent due to arthritis."

People could shop for fresh produce right there in the mall. Sounded like a fantastic idea but the land most malls occupy is too valuable to use as urban farms so it will never happen.

Sounded like a fantastic idea but the land most malls occupy is too valuable to use as urban farms so it will never happen.   Yeah, the land that urban malls are built on would be too valuable. After those buildings age they'll be torn down and replaced...not really an issue.  But there are some gnarly strip malls built out in the middle of nowhere (where I'm at). Those are the ones that will become ""ghost towns"" in a few decades. That would be awesome if they were converted into hydroponic farms (TIL) but the demand for fresh produce wouldn't be strong enough to draw consumers out there, especially since they're in a rural setting to begin with. Unfortunately the demand for Abercrombie is strong enough for these places to be built in the first place. :/"

TheWayWeWere,3buwzn,herhigh-ness,9,Thu Jul 2 18:27:48 2015 UTC,"Weird lighting from the old cameras. As u/gentlemandinosaur pointed out, MAKEUP. Why do women from the 20s always have deep-set eyes, long thin eyebrows, and small yet pouty lips? Because those were the makeup styles of the time.  Since those styles were popular, women who naturally had such features were considered attractive and therefore photographed more for magazines, films, ads, etc. In 50 years people will probably look back at photos from today and wonder why the women all have defined cheekbones, thick eyebrows, and big lips. Because Kim Kardashian, that's why."

And there are plenty of women who look beautiful without makeup (I would say that the women in your pictures are still fairly attractive without it), but if you are used to seeing them with a lot of makeup they will look a little weird.  I definitely agree with you about the clothing and hair styles, though. We see those outfits as extremely frumpy, but clearly people at the time found them to be attractive. It makes a big difference."

There is a great Chinese restaurant called Yummy House (and I am serious about how fantastic this place is) that does all family style meals. Monk's steamer bar if you feel like having some libations and shellfish. The Oaks open pit BBQ is a hole in the wall next to a gas station on 41 that is simply outrageous.

TheWayWeWere,3bmh23,dikmssl2,2,Tue Jun 30 15:48:43 2015 UTC,"The Oaks is seriously some of the best BBQ I have ever had, it is worth a stop. But for some tasty and fancy options. I forgot that summertime starts the Savor Sarasota event where some of the finer more expensive restaurants offer select 3 course menus for $30 a person. So you could get away with a steal at some of these places.  Downtown Sarasota has Salute for Italian, all their stuff is made from scratch in house. Same with Cafe Bijou for French, all from scratch and right Downtown. There's a great modern restaurant called MeLANge which is only open at night, super gourmet food and cocktails and Lan is probably the best chef in the city. Another great late night cocktail and hor dourves spot downtown is Classico. Kasey's Seafood is a great, very unassuming restaurant if you want Seafood.

I don't know what that comment used to say, but since you asked honestly, I'm happy to tell you--only as an offering to hopefully further your English journey. I hope you take this in the good spirit in which it is meant. :)  Your English is very good. It's impressive, especially considering your proficiency in other languages. I think your sentence is fine, and totally comprehensible, but there are very minor word choices that seem just a little bit off.  They aren't wrong, just different than what seems natural to a native speaker.  I would probably have written: ""You're right. But to be honest, I wouldn't want to have to wear as much as they did (used to) when I go tailgating.""  In the comment just above your sentence would better read: ""I'm Belgian. I learned to speak French and Dutch before English.""  I think both of your comments are totally fine the way they are. I only offer this critique as a former teacher of English to foreign speakers."

The emulsion in old photos was often not very good at picking up this colour).   Her hands don't seem particularly dark either if you compare them to the shadowy part of her face.

End Cambridge--------  ""So . . . as"" is used for negative comparatives (At least that is the way the old-fashioned writers used it).  It was reserved for formal writing. Then it became a matter of style. Today, I know it is archaic.  I quickly googled it and found only a handful of pages on which it was barely discussed.

Side note: I'm pretty sure tan started to became desirable in the 50s, when being outside became much more of a luxury.  The popular skin tone is usually whatever the very rich can afford (so being pale is desirable when manual labor takes you outside and being tan is in style when only the rich can afford the time off to hang out at the beach)."
TheWayWeWere,3b0g09,chovey,3,Thu Jun 25 04:23:27 2015 UTC,I've read a few times that tanning became popular in the 20's after Coco Chanel got a sunburn on a cruise.
TheWayWeWere,3b0g09,Constasius,5,Thu Jun 25 05:53:14 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia   Throughout history, tanning has gone in and out of fashion. In the United States before about the 1920s, tanned skin was associated with the lower classes, because they worked outdoors and were exposed to the sun. Women went to great lengths to preserve pallid skin, as a sign of their ""refinement"". (...) Shortly thereafter, in the 1920s, fashion-designer Coco Chanel accidentally got sunburnt while visiting the French Riviera. When she arrived home, she arrived with a suntan and her fans apparently liked the look and started to adopt darker skin tones themselves. Tanned skin became a trend partly because of Coco’s status and the longing for her lifestyle by other members of society. In addition, Parisians fell in love with Josephine Baker, a “caramel-skinned” singer in Paris, and idolised her dark skin. (...)   Love this part :   In China, darker skin is still considered by many to be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, ski masks were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer's face from the effects of the sun."

First of all, I just assumend this picture was taken around 1939, could have been 1935 or plus minus some years. Why do I mentioned that? Because my grandpa and his brother straight went to the war in 1939, my grandpa came back after ten years (5 years of war-prisoner after the war) and his brother, the youngest on the right died in Russia in 1942. My great-grandfather, the one who some of you claming is wearing a swastika-pin could have been a party-member of the NSDAP. Honestly I don't know but I still highly doubt it since im doing genealogy for a very long time and almost have all relevant documents regarding his life, I also collected all war-related documents of my grandpa from his life as a soldier in WWII and I even didn't find a hint that his family or father was associated with the NSDAP.

In all fairness, most of what Hitler had done to this point in the public eye was to bring the Germans back to their 'former glory' and to reclaim 'German land and peoples' back to the Fatherland.    Most of his more terrible stuff (And yes, many atrocities had already occurred, but not nearly as widely known at this point) had not ramped up to the death factory levels it did later.  What I am trying to say I guess is that it was probably pretty easy for the average citizen to think he was good for Germany.  For them, everything was still coming up roses.

You can argue that he might've only joined the party for the sake of the personal social/economic benefits he hoped to gain from it, but pretending he was too dumb to realize what the party stood for is ridiculous. It's just that it seems that even if he wasn't a true believer, he was willing to make the deal with the devil for his own benefit."

The fact is that the size, shape, and location of that pin are identical to where a Party Badge would have been worn. These guys also fit the demographics most likely to have been involved in the Party. Is it fair to assume that it is definitely a Party Badge? Probably not. But there are people in this thread that actual Party members weren't necessarily so bad or that they couldn't have known what was going on, which is really just bad history."
TheWayWeWere,3ayep4,sealblubber,12,Wed Jun 24 21:22:36 2015 UTC,I think it's a shame that OP's interest in showing his family has turned into a discussion of Nazism.

My great grandmother lived in that house until the 1980's when she passed away.  Sometime in the late 1940's she had a medical issue that made it hard for her to climb stairs, so her husband built this little, one bedroom cottage with a bay window and all of the amenities a ways back on the property where she could recuperate. He built that rose trellis, planted the climbing roses and planted a garden around it (unfortunately is not visible in the pictures)  After grans recuperation the 'little house' was used for everything from family members needing a resting place from troubles to honeymoon quarters.

TheWayWeWere,3apkmo,sciarrillo,15,Mon Jun 22 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a side effect of the movies.  Film technology was rather primitive during the 1920s. Most movies were made with ""orthochromatic"" film, which had reduced sensitivity to red color. To compensate for that, they used white make-up, which made faces in movies look very pale. That made it necessary to use heavy eye-lining, otherwise there would be no distinction between the skin and the white of the eye, and heavy dark lipstick.  Using a heavy whitish powder, eye-liner, and lipstick created a movie-like look, which flappers would consider attractive."

TheWayWeWere,3am85y,msweatherwax,7,Sun Jun 21 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"I have some ""manners for teens"" books from the late 40's and mid 50's that I found at goodwill. Apparently a teenage party back in the day involved lots of party platters and everyone was expected to bring something. Personal hygiene and grooming was out of this world too, and you better know how to dance appropriately because there WILL be a parent chaperon, in fact it suggests you call and ask if there will be a chaperon before accepting the invitation just in case. Different times."

The hipster adopted the lifestyle of the jazz musician, including some or all of the following: dress, slang, use of cannabis and other drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humor, self-imposed poverty and relaxed sexual codes.  In early 2000, the term hipster reappeared, but with other meanings. Now it means something closer to ‘bohemian’. Hipsters of 2015 are middle-upper class people who feign the homeless look and typically worship Apple products, yet think things from the 50's are cool."
