For metals - The hardware store Krylon Primer if the weather is cooperating, Vallejo primer through the airbrush if not.   GW plastics - GW Imperial Primer (the brush on stuff in the pot, love it) or Vallejo airbrushed if I have a lot to do or on bigger stuff.   Everything else - Usually defaults to Vallejo  I really prefer the Krylon on metals, but getting too thick of a coat can be a problem. Takes some practice with the spray can, but I can usually get a good coverage without losing too much detail."
minipainting,3e2e4i,JDdan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"While I use hardware store primer most of the time and find it 100% acceptable, I have noticed one major difference between the Hobby brands and the hardware brands of primer. The spray nozzle sprays much finer with most hobby brands. This can be incredibly helpful in getting a thinner more evenly spread primer layer. This is even more important when you are going for a zenith primer method."

Other then that its a matter of preference and what level you're painting at. Like a lot of people I really like airbrush primer but in a pinch I'll use p3s.  [edit] My love for airbrush primer has nothing to do with cost, I just like its finish and how it reacts to paint after it sets. Thats the problem I have with Krylon, I've never had a consistent finish and sometimes its too smooth and paint has a hard time spreading evenly on it."
minipainting,3e2e4i,BrownNote,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"Put simply, there's a difference between primer and spray paint. Spray paint is just aerosolized paint, while primer is actually used to prime a surface (or model in our case) for further painting. This difference isn't limited to model painting, if you go to paint walls you'll notice they sell primer as well as actual paint.   Primer is slightly sticky compared to normal paint (not enough to feel different when painting, but it's definitely noticeable to the touch) as it's meat to hold the first layer of paint on. It's also not as permanent as normal paint, so playing with primed only models (something I'm sure we've all done) will lead to much more chipping than playing with spray painted black only models.   That all said, depending on your level of painting, there will likely be little to no difference. This isn't an insult, I've been painting models for 10 years and only just started preferring actual primer. For most people into hobby gaming, the main purpose of the black undercoat is to get a base layer and shadow any spots they miss. Black spray paint will do that just as well as primer. And if you make sure to seal your models with a clearcoat of varnish (which you should either way), the paint will stay sturdy while playing.    When it comes to white, on the other hand, I've found the spray paint to be much worse to use than real primer. I always suggest to my friends, if they don't care about using just spray paint, to buy the $.99 black stuff but actually buy the white primer.   Also note that even many hobby ""primers"" are more akin to spray paint. I remember when I was using aerosol primer that... ArmyPainter, maybe? was $7, about half the price of Citadel, but seemed much more like just branded spray paint."

minipainting,3e2e4i,keye927,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:01:02 2015 UTC,I find it to be the complete opposite. Army painter white was the only way to go until I switched to my air gun. It might be the humidity where your at. I could never touch the gw primer. I hated it once I found army painter.
minipainting,3e2e4i,mrmace519,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:06:10 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the size of the 'tooth' that the primer has. Primer's job being to provide a secure and even painting surface to start from, it has the tooth to ensure the next layers of paint have something to grab on to. My understanding is generic primer is generally not meant for something so small as a mini but for larger surfaces. Some may work better than others and some experimentation (which is usually recommended anyway for learning what works best for you) will also help. I recently read through this which speaks to some of the different considerations. The most relevant being this:   Acrylic paint (including the high pigment content Base or foundation acrylic) doesn’t stick well to metal or plastic.  Primer does stick to the material well, gives a fine even coverage that doesn’t obscure the fine details of your mini.  It will also provide a “tooth“.  Tooth is the slight graininess that the primer has on the surface of your mini.  You want a tiny bit of grain, as this microscopic texture helps your acrylic paint take to the mini.  If you spray on too much primer, especially all at once, or use a non-mini-primer spray, or an enamel spray, gloss spray etc, you’ll end up with a shiny finish.  This has no tooth, and you’ll find your paint wants to ball up rather than stick where you put it."
minipainting,3e2e4i,redpiano,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"If you're using a matte primer, which you should be, then this isn't the case. I flood my miniatures with primer so that it all absorbs into itself and creates a nice smooth finish, when it dries, it's matte and if it's matte that means it has a porous surface great for painting. I get this finish regardless of whether I'm using rustoleum primer or miniature branded primers like Vallejo or Army Painter's awful shit."
minipainting,3e2e4i,CasualToast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to make sure of is that whatever you get is a light thin primer that isn't going to damage your miniature.  Anything that says PRIMER FILLER is just that...a primer designed to fill and build on gaps and therefore would completely destroy the details on your piece. Also ETCH PRIME are primers that are meant to grip into metal and surfaces that normal primers wont have enough bite for, those primers might destroy your minis.  I personally use Krylon's $3 primers and have had no problems at all, as long as I do very light coats from an appropriate distance."
minipainting,3e2e4i,MisterCrispy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"Take it with a grain of salt because it could still be salesperson BS: According to the dude at my local GW shop, the Citadel primer tends to shrink a bit when it dries so that if you accidentally put on a slightly thicker coat, it's still not going to completely clog detail.  I think if you just ""git gud"" with your priming technique it's a non-issue as far as which primer you use. Learn to apply/build up thin coats and you can get whatever cheap primer you want.  Personally, and I'm going to turn into ""that guy"" for a moment, I started using my airbrush to prime my models and I've never looked back."

After talking to a GW store manager, even the GW white primer had this problem to a lesser degree. He did say that they changed the formula to try to fix this. If this is the case, it is a big reason to go to GW primers."

I'm not a very good painter-I have shaky hands, so doing too much highlighting is very hard for me. I make up for this (I think) by trying to make good use of inks and washes. That is how I came up with the scheme I'm using-it's easy to apply, and looks good, despite looking like Necrons a bit...hehe.  So my question-I don't want my vehicles to be big silver ships. I'd like to paint them purple, the same purple as the cloth on these warriors, and the secondary being balthasar gold, the same color on the warriors guns/spiky armor bits. Do you think the army would look strange with purple vehicles? I want the army to look and feel cohesive, but I am worried since the warriors are mainly silver the vehicles would look out of place from the troops.  Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated! First time back into the hobby in many years, excited to get the army painted and going.

From what I can see it looks like you have a pretty solid color pallet.

But if you are going to basecoat each region anyway it shouldn't matter really as the basecoat will fill the gaps. If you have a particularly finicky model that will be hard to get a brush into all the crannies and nooks then i could see the value but tbh itd be better just going black with white drybrush or black and white basecoat before other basecoats for bright areas :)

I would recommend wetting your brush, dipping the brush in the paint, then smoothing it all out on a palette (anything non-porous will do) before applying it to the mini.  Others will probably mention a wet-palette, but I would say just mixing in a bit of water to your paint before brushing it on will help a lot and not require jumping through a lot of extra hoops."

This is a really good first try though, you have really good brush control already! The models are already up to low tabletop standard IMO.

That way you won't contaminate the pot by putting your brush into it a bunch, you'll be able to mix colors and water them down, and the paint will have a much longer life since you won't have it open the whole time you're using the color.

minipainting,3e0fdo,Kantas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"I recently painted a bunch of buildings with an airbrush. Black, green, grey, etc went through just fine.

minipainting,3dykuj,im_your_boyfriend,2,Mon Jul 20 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"Freelance work is tough, especially for the arts. Your work and pay is based on people being interested enough in your style and work. A number of people will go into it with a passion for painting very nice high level work, but it can get frustrating when you realize you may need to pay the bills sometimes with some low level army paintwork.  That being said, I've found if you maintain a level of professionalism, network around, friend other famous and better painters out there, it helps spread your name and helps you get noticed. The more visible you are the more work you'll find coming towards you. Granted not all of them will be worth it or won't end up as a commission, but it helps. Continually share your work on social networks, and take commissions. You could even contact companies and offer your services to paint for them.  Helping win competitions helps a lot too. Though GamesDay was a big one that doesn't seem to be around much, there's still things like the Crystal Brush and the up and growing Draconic Awards from WGC. It's one of the sure fire ways to get noticed and definitely get attention if you win. I've chatted with Jessica Rich, who works for Dark Sword miniatures, she's not a big fan of competitions, but she gave some advice that she does them anyway because it's one of the major ways to stay up to date, stay on your game, and get visibility.  As for making a living, it's possible. It's a lot of work, but it's doable. Meg Maples makes a living from commission work, James Wappel as well. Meg has an article somewhere about making a living from commission work, I'll have to find it somewhere. Anthony Wang makes a living off commission work as well, not as big of a name probably, may never heard of him. I didn't until I met him teaching some painting classes and Adepticon. That's one way to also grow and network.   Another thing is, as you mentioned you realize you're getting good locally, is that when you start posting on the internet, you may find the people be a bit harsh. You may have people tell you it's very basic, or wonder why your CMON score is low. You may look at other people's work and wonder if you'll even come close to that level of work. You may think you'll have to charge low or work for free to get any commissions. As long as you paint and be open to critiques, you'll always improve and try to have fun. Don't ever sell yourself short and don't ever work for a company for free.   Most of the above is for going at it on your own doing freelance commission work. As for apprenticeships and internships, I haven't heard of any that openly do that sort of stuff, but you can always look around and ask.   Follow some of the famous painters and see what kind of work they do. Check out CMON and Putty & Paint."
minipainting,3dykuj,itsacoyote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the well thought out, well worded I formation and advice. I appreciate the time and help. I am curious, since you seem to know, how one gets a painting ""rated"", as you mentioned with coolminiornot."
minipainting,3dykuj,itsacoyote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"If you haven't signed up on CoolMiniOrNot, you should check it out and do so. You can submit your photos of completed works to the CMON gallery and people will vote on a scale of 1 to 10. In general, anything above a 6 is decent, 7-8 is pretty good, and anything 9+ is phenomenal, usually Golden Demon level of work. Granted, that's not a hardfast rule of scoring and friends and trolls can skew the scoring a bit, but it's a basic means of seeing how your work can be taken by the community and even better, it's visibility for your work. Sadly, the scoring can also get skewed by the subject of work (space marines are always popular), but it's really only one of the biggest and popular mini gallery on the internet. WAMP may be another one to check out.  Also, both CoolMiniOrNot and WAMP have contests which are worth checking out, there are a bunch of contests floating around online for painting minis that can be good for practice and sharing work.  Putty and Paint is a similar gallery, but invite only and the level of quality is very high (in comparison to CMON, it's just 9+ quality of work there). To get an invite would be an indication of high quality and recognition of your work."
minipainting,3dykuj,jayadan,2,Mon Jul 20 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"All of the ""professional painting"" that I've ever done has all been based on the quality of my work and nothing more.  My first painted minis sales were done at conventions in the 1980's. My friends and I would get a table, bring painted minis, and sell them.  I did a little commission work in the 90's. This was just work that I got because people liked what I could do.  I got a job painting models for the movie Starship Troopers in 1996 based on my portfolio of miniatures and models that I'd built for myself.  I've been doing freelance miniature painting for the past few years, full time since January, because people like my stuff.  It's just one of those things that if you can do it well you can do it professionally. But don't expect to be able to necessarily find a ""real"" job doing it these days. You have to make your own work happen."

I'm more in the area of ""I like playing football, and I'm one of the best players at my high school. What are the steps from here to work towards getting in the NFL"" haha.     I'm one of the best in my area, but want to step up my game. Are there painters that will take on ""apprentices"" to teach better technique and whatnot?    My only real collection is older stuff. I may have some pictures sitting around somewhere on this new phone, let me check and I'll post back."
minipainting,3dykuj,ignisphaseone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:33:41 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that being a studio painter or getting a job at a company like blue table painting is no different than applying for any other job.  But then also I don't think most companies have in-house painters anymore, not even Reaper does now I don't think."
minipainting,3dykuj,SpecsaversGaza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Professional painting as a hobby? Go to some of the events around the country and submit your pieces there. If you look up the Crystal Brush award or the Golden Demon, they should have details on what events will qualify you. For example, the painting contest at KublaCon has a qualifier pass for the Crystal Brush as the Best In Show award. Can also submit into one of two brackets.  Professional painting as your job? I'd just apply to the company you'd be interested in studio painting for. I'd imagine it being like applying for an artist position: portfolio of pieces, demonstrate both ability to paint as well as the ability to properly light/photo your minis, etc.  I'm not anywhere near a good enough painter to do either of these, so I've never tried myself."

minipainting,3dxhst,smurphii,3,Mon Jul 20 10:10:51 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb - if your eyesight is okay for the most part, using a magnifier is pretty pointless. If you're having to ""zoom in"" to see details, there's a large chance those details will not be noticed without using magnification.  If you are deadset on glasses, have a look for something like these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Headband-Headset-Jeweler-Magnifier-Magnifying/dp/B009O5T3FU  They've got swappable lenses of different strengths + a lamp.   I've never liked painting under magnification, so have no idea if they're any good."
minipainting,3dxhst,randomisation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:08 2015 UTC,Ditto.  In addition you'll have to train your hand how to move under a magnifier which will also be a pain in the ass.
minipainting,3dxhst,my_mini_account,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:17 2015 UTC,I just recently started painting miniatures and I had a pair of reading glasses I hag bought that were too powerful for me to read with. I pulled them out and they have been a big help navigating my brush into the small areas. I stick my miniatures on a stand  though so I can hold them while I paint and get them right in my face if I have to. It can make focusing elsewhere difficult but if I am just focused on the miniature then its not a problem.
minipainting,3dxhst,ElsieSteam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with randomisation on the product to get if you want some magnification. Those things are a bit better for what you want to do and you can swap out magnifications for what you're comfortable with.  I disagree with his comment that a magnifier is pretty pointless though. Sure, if you've got good eyesight and you're not doing heavy minute detail work, you may not think you need a magnifying glass. I didn't for a time, I thought it was crazy to think one would need a magnifier for painting. I got lasik recently and during the recovery time I had crappy near vision and eyesight tired out very quickly. I picked up a jewelers magnifying set and it saved my eyes the strain. With the 2x to 3.5x you can hold the mini at a decent distance without the sharp focus at 6 inches from your face."
minipainting,3dxhst,itsacoyote,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"I'm shortsighted, -4.25 in both eyes so when I take my glasses off it's like wearing powerful reading glasses.  I almost never do this when painting, but if I do need to see something up close it's an easy way to do it.  I only ever do this if there is something specific I want to check or a really fine detail to paint like eyeballs.   The problem is they focus about 6 inches in front of my face,    That's the entire point of reading glasses.  You don't wear glasses to act as magnifying lenses, you wear glasses to change the distances you can focus at.  The benefit of those reading glasses is that you can hold something right in front of your eyes and focus on it, much closer than you could without them.  What benefit do you want to get from wearing glasses?  That's probably a better place to start this discussion than what happens when you do wear them."

If you use a mask and work quickly, you can prime in an air conditioned room, then leave the room.  You just need to let the minis dry enough to touch them, so depending on brand 5 to 15 minutes. Then open all windows to the room and run a fan on high to ventilate it.    Source: living in the rainy pacific northwest. I have to get creative if I want to aerosal prime in the winter.

The problem you are probably having is that most silver coloured paints are really greys with the metallic element mixed in, so when you mix your red in you're mixing red and grey and getting a bit of a mess.  The armour I did on this guy was done with metallic medium mixed with shades of red. Depends on how shiny you want it to how much medium you use, it can be a bit fiddly to get right."

When you mix red with silver, you're basically mixing it with shiny stuff and grey paint, hence the crappy colour.

You can see it literally all over the model, the sharp edges on the sword are round and fat on the Bones versions, the straps around his waist are all much more ballooned in size, the detail on his belt, the medallion, even his hair is all immediately recognizably bad in the bones models compared to the metal one. Even his arms are noticeably fatter and fluffy looking.  That's not to say bones are AWFUL, but they do not match up 100% to metal and I think we should stop pretending that they do.   It does vary from one model to the next, even the author of that post recognizes this and as he says some batches come out better than others.

minipainting,3dmku8,brianpi,5,Mon Jul 20 11:08:39 2015 UTC,Looking back at the last two bones kickstarters they finished over $3million. Is Bones III running slow or do they normally jump in the end? Just wondering.
minipainting,3dmku8,jestergoblin,7,Fri Jul 17 16:49:31 2015 UTC,"The ending usually jumps as they show more (usually bigger figure) teasers.  EDIT: Like the ""Dragons Don't Share"" set in Bones II."
minipainting,3dmku8,D1G1T4LM0NK3Y,6,Fri Jul 17 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"This one is running slower, but they are also only running it for 18 days instead of 30."
minipainting,3dmku8,stageseven,4,Fri Jul 17 17:44:46 2015 UTC,"People are still recovering after spending hundreds on the last one and most of us probably have only painted a few (because we're still working on the first Bones figures). Myself, I just don't see anything worthwhile. A lot of what's in Bones 3 is filler and crap I'll never use or paint.  I will however wait for the last day and see if anything big or worthwhile pops up in the add-ons and just get those."
minipainting,3dmku8,Ass_Masster,5,Fri Jul 17 17:08:08 2015 UTC,"I guess to each their own, I think the core set on this one is pretty killer so far.  Only things I can't see myself using are the Savage Worlds minis, and I'm very exited about the transparent heroes and the various monstrous creatures in this one.  Expansion 1 also looks pretty great, the patchwork golems are very nice.  I've been mostly disappointed by the add-on options this time, although I am planning on getting Kyra and Lavarath. And of course Tianot whenever she comes out."
minipainting,3dmku8,Orion_Pirate,2,Fri Jul 17 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"After spending all day every day on the campaign page since it started I can pretty confidently say that that observation is only half true. In Bones 2 I believe the broke 1 million, or close on day one, and unlocked a massive number of stretch goals, after that pledges dropped to almost nothing after that. Then the last day skyrocketed again. With Bone 3 they spaced out the stretch goals by 75k+ in the beginning, and now closed the gaps to 30k or so, which means cool stuff is getting revealed every day. Yes it only brought in 700k or so first day but theres been (albite a same massive drop off) a lot more steady day to day donation. Its sitting around 1.3mill right now, and gaining tens of thousands a day still, I think with the worst day still being better than most middle days of bones 2. This one will almost certainly spike at the end, as well as in the middle when cool stuff is released. Because who doesn't want a tiamat with the wingspan of a toddler for under $50?   TL;DR Bones 2 had massive 1st day pledges, abysmal though the last day, Bones 3 had a strong 1st day, and sustainable and constant through the rest."

minipainting,3dmku8,kmj2l,4,Fri Jul 17 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"you underestimate how much minis cost outside of the US. As an australian, it will cost me 200AUD to get the core set and ship it and convert my weak dollar to USD...  however, that many minis for 200AUD? plz. buying that much at a hobby store would cost me at least a thousand here."
minipainting,3dmku8,Lakus,3,Sun Jul 19 09:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I am over $100 shipping, which is about US$130 and I haven't even selected everything. However the overall cost is still better than it would be to purchase the minis that I would want from this retail.  Also it will allow me to share with friends."
minipainting,3dmku8,davekayaus,3,Mon Jul 20 00:58:06 2015 UTC,Can you buy the stuff cheaper retail after the fact?
minipainting,3dmku8,onlineFace,5,Fri Jul 17 22:22:03 2015 UTC,In Norway (where I live)? Fat chance. They'll be twice as expensive as the $ retail price when/if they get here. Which makes this awesome.
minipainting,3dmku8,unidentifiable,3,Fri Jul 17 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"Well assuming you want to spend $100, you immediately save $50 in postage. It would cost me $150 for the $100 Bones deal, yet I can buy $100 of Bones from the Reaper website and they will send that post free from the same location (their warehouse) to the same location (my house).   So my feeling with this, as with Bones 2, is that I'm better off buying exactly what I want after the fact than get all excited and pay an extra $50 upfront to ship models I don't want and will never paint."
minipainting,3dmku8,onlineFace,2,Sat Jul 18 09:19:48 2015 UTC,"Are there any Canadians who can share the current estimated cost of shipping the Core Set?   Shipping is such a wild card here and with the exchange rate really determines whether or not this is worth it.   The cost of a single regular sized mini at my FLGS is ~$3/ea, the same as on Reaper's site. When I factor in the free shipping on orders over $35, despite the awesome number of minis you'll get in Bones 3, it may just save me a lot of money to get what I want when they're available to the public."
minipainting,3dmku8,Lakus,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"If you use the pledge calculator it gives the exact figure.  I am a Canadian backer of both Bones 1 and 2.  <Naturally the Pledge Manager is down at the moment>  I think the going rate was ~$30 for shipping if all you bought was the Core.  USD.  Remember that $100 for the core set is also USD, and $130 USD is about $160 CAD.  They'll also tax you at the border.  I backed Bones 2 for ~$200, plus ~$50 for shipping, and they taxed me 5% (No PST: Alberta).  Total was around $280, can't recall exactly.  It honestly wasn't a bad deal, but the dollar was much stronger last year.  With the strong dollar it was approximately Pledge x 1.5.  Now with a weaker buck it's closer to Pledge x 2.0.  Your $100 core set will end up costing you around $200.  If you have a few friends or guys at the FLGS that will pool for a single shipment, you can split the costs much better.  I'm not backing Bones 3 for a few reasons:   Low Canuck Buck means I'm getting gouged 30% right from the start. Shipping is extra, and extra-brutal because of the low dollar. There's less that's interesting to me this time.  Having backed both 1 and 2, I really am only interested (so far) in Marthrangul, Kyra, and the Mouslings.  Mystic Circle honestly looks like something you could build at home with foam insulation. I have a huge backlog.  I've still got like 200 minis to paint."
minipainting,3dmku8,Krazed59,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:54:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the breakdown. This is exactly the kind of outline and experience I was hoping to see.   I figured the combination of low CDN and shipping would bring the $100 pledge close to $200 which is a bit much when the cost at my FLGS for Bones minis is pretty much what Reaper sells them for on the site.   The KS is an amazing deal if you're in the US but I may have to sit this one out.   Thanks again for the post! :)

minipainting,3dmku8,Ass_Masster,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem for me lies in that they switched over to digital sculpting for a lot of their new lines.  I read an interview with Bobby Jackson saying he had moved exclusively to using ZBrush.  It clearly shows in a lot of these new sculpts he did  as they are missing that organic feel and don't seem as detailed.  If you look at the Crusaders, Townsfolk, Corsairs, Mouslings, the Goblins, and a few of the items in the Stoneskull expansion, they just stand out due to the differences between hand sculpted and digitally sculpted.   Nothing wrong with that,  but it looks out of place with the greatly different final product when side by side.  Old mouslings were hand made from what I can tell looking at the ones I had from Bones 2 and just had that better feel."

I can't seem to figure out how to pledge the extra $50. On the Kickstarter/Bones3 page they only have $1 and $100 options, no $50. I can see them on the calculator though, but when I select them, my pledged amount of $100 doesn't increase. Do you simply select the rewards with the calculator and then pay when the project closes?"
minipainting,3dmku8,kmj2l,2,Fri Jul 17 17:34:47 2015 UTC,I've been using the pledge calculator and then changing my pledge amount in the kickstarter site itself. The calculator is how they know what to send you for the amount you paid.
minipainting,3dmku8,Lakus,2,Fri Jul 17 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"Use the blue ""manage"" button by your current pledge amount. You add up what you want in the pledge calculator and then just pledge that amount.   So, for a core and expansion 1 pledge for a core and put in 150.00 manually."

I think I saw on Amazon that you can get a used Nikon D60 (this is the camera that I have) for about $250. The standard 18-55mm lens that it comes with can be used for photographing minis, but I'd still recommend making sure you have a good lighting set up, which can be done fairly inexpensively (definitely check out the article /u/redpiano linked)."

Regarding the diffusion gel/paper, if not available anywhere in your area (again, a dedicated camera shop should have them if there's one in your area) there are a lot of options, like wax or parchment paper (I might suggest parchment paper because it can handle higher temperatures), fabric (nylon is popular), or you can purchase a light box like this."
minipainting,3dmfdo,mrselkies,5,Fri Jul 17 13:31:29 2015 UTC,Looks good for a first try. I would recommend trying less paint on the brush and watering it down a little more. It's better to have more layers in thinner coats.
minipainting,3dmfdo,silentphantom,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:34:38 2015 UTC,Definitely something I need to start consciously doing. I've found that when I tried I had a hard time balancing between not enough water and too much to the point where it's basically a wash. Any rules of thumb for thinning I should be using?
minipainting,3dmfdo,silentphantom,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"My method is to scoop out some paint using an old brush onto a palette, then use a small pipette to drop enough water for the consistency I'm going for, give or take a few drops. It takes a few goes to get a feel for it, but you'll get there :)  Often times some colours seem to be thicker than others, so there really is no set rule for it. When you've painted with your favourite paints a few time, you'll get used to how they feel. It's just practice!"

minipainting,3dmfdo,MrGraveRisen,2,Fri Jul 17 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"A consistency between whole milk and low fat milk.  Wipe excess off on the side of a palette well when loading the brush, or touch your brush for a moment to paper towel to suck out excess water.  The paint should be thin and flow like a wash; the trick is to not have so much of it in the brush so that it doesn't come out in a flood the moment it touches the model."
minipainting,3dmfdo,redpiano,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"There's a preeeeeeeeeeetty large gap between not enough and too much water. tip 1 would be have a bit more paint on there to ease your margin of errors a bit. Tip 2 would be to dip your brush in the water, give it a quick wipe on the edge of the cup, THEN mix the paint with your wet brush.   You're absolutely on the right track so far, the next step is applying the highlights in the right places. it looks like you just added a drop of a lighter color on each armor plate, but you want to blend it out towards the edges.   Here's a great video, along with their others   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M5hzXN8OlY"
minipainting,3dofuh,Shuliak,7,Fri Jul 17 22:56:04 2015 UTC,Pointed round is the commonly recommended type.
minipainting,3dofuh,redpiano,2,Sat Jul 18 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"IMO a 000 is a waste, you'd be better off getting a liner brush or an extra long lettering brush. That will hold plenty of paint, comes to a good point and is more versatile than the 000.  Personally most of my brushes are 0 or 1 round pointed.  I've got a couple of #2 bright for applying primer and a couple of fan brushes for wet blending and that is it.  As far as synthetic vs natural, I prefer the synthetic as they are more durable than natural. I think that is definitely personal preference and newer brushes vs 10 or more years ago when natural was better. Currently my favorite brushes are the Princeton Umbria series. That too has changed over time as new products come out."
minipainting,3dofuh,deltadave,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:12:22 2015 UTC,Honestly for mini painting those linear brushes are terrible. No fine control at all. I do own a 0000 that I use to detail the irises in eyes and that's about it... I'd say 90% of what I do is done with a #2 pointed round. Good quality kolinsky sables hold enough of a point to do eyes even with the #2.   I own synthetic brushes. they usually last a few days before they get so bad I turn them into glue brushes. Meanwhile one of my W&N 7 size 1's is currently 8 years old and still holds a tip :)
minipainting,3dofuh,MrGraveRisen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:36:38 2015 UTC,"I love my liner brush. Since I do quite a lot of knotwork and banners, it's the perfect tool. Control can be difficult, but the amount of paint loading and fine tip give great results. It's great for eyes as well, just add a bit of flow aid to the paint and making perfect iris' is if not easy at least straightforward. The trick is to use the brush while it still has a bit of stiffness left over from the last time it was cleaned.  I too have some really old natural sable brushes, but find myself working more with the synthetics over the past couple of years with good results. It stinks that yours went bad so fast, I hate wasting money on brushes that don't last. Time will tell about the latest synthetics, but I'm at 2 years and counting now."
minipainting,3dofuh,deltadave,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"A good quality kolinsky sable size 1 or 2 will have a point as fine as anything else and will last 10 times as long. Even the tiniest brushes can splay and fail to keep a point pretty quickly if they're cheap. Worse, the small brushes don't have a ""belly"" to keep the paint wet, so it dries very quickly.  Synthetic brushes have their uses (they're better for ""side brushing"" because they're firmer).  Brands like Windsor Newton (Series 7), Raphael, and Da Vinci are (I think) the gold standard, but you can find pretty good Kolinsky sable brushes that are less expensive, keep a fine point, and will last a long time."

I don't necessarily know all the specifics about what you're looking for but this model might be a good place to start:  http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/gallery/cryx/warcasters/master-necrotech-mortenebra-deryliss  However if I understand you correctly you want her to have 4 biological arms and 2 robotic along with 8 eyes? It sounds to me like that will be a ton of detail crammed onto one 30mm model and you might have trouble pulling it off without just pinning random arms everywhere or sculpting your own.  Oh also all those spider legs don't come attached. They're like the worst part of actually making this model so you wouldn't have to worry about removing them.

minipainting,3dmc9b,onlineFace,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:25:55 2015 UTC,Thank you — gave them back to my friend / pretty cool to see them come back to life [insert animated skeleton joke]
minipainting,3dmm3t,baudbard,7,Fri Jul 17 14:29:43 2015 UTC,I'm seeing at least 2 different coats of dry brushing. The first coat looks like a mid gray on a black base coat. The second looks to be a light gray on top of that and mostly focused on the hard edges.
minipainting,3dmm3t,dorpal_the_great,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:34 2015 UTC,Looks like grey drybrushing on top of a black basecoat to me.
minipainting,3dmm3t,Lakus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:30:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This is one of those solutions that was right in front of me, but I couldn't see it.  Back to the model!"
minipainting,3dmm3t,Tophat_Benny,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:57 2015 UTC,I see dark blue in there too.  Instead of just a black base coat try a deep blue to get that specific look.  But black works just fine too :)
minipainting,3dmm3t,DontHandleMeBro,3,Fri Jul 17 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"To me it looks like a black basecoat with a light grey drybrush, then a brighter grey lighter drybrush .Then washed with black then blue, then another very very light grey drybrush"
minipainting,3dmm3t,SpecsaversGaza,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:19:54 2015 UTC,It also looks as if the edges have been highlighted.
minipainting,3dmm3t,MGubser,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:49 2015 UTC,Blue basecoat and two layers of dry brushing with the lighter gray layer reserved for the edges.
minipainting,3dkwvs,KaiserBot,3,Fri Jul 17 02:36:34 2015 UTC,"It's not bad, but like any wash it could benefit from you going back over it with the base colour and a quick highlight (especially the green ribbon on his medal)."
minipainting,3dkwvs,AdmiralCrackbar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:38:01 2015 UTC,Just brushed it on?  Which tone did you use?
minipainting,3dkwvs,hillean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:07:03 2015 UTC,Yep!  Just brushed-on some Strong Tone.  No thinning or anything!
minipainting,3dlb7d,drpestilence,6,Fri Jul 17 04:53:59 2015 UTC,"I find it helps if you don't look at it as a whole, break your collection down into smaller, more manageable projects. Example, with warhammer 40k, I have about 100 models to paint (not joking here), but to keep motivated I don't look at all of it at once, instead I do smaller projects (a squad of troopers, a vehicle, a special character, etc). Helps make it feel like I'm achieving something. Normally I would do a squad of troopers and then a vehicle and then something else, each mini project is broken up by doing something different next."
minipainting,3dlb7d,NightLancer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:21:59 2015 UTC,"I get ya, and keep changing things up, I just did a gorkanaught and am working on some dreads but maybe I should do some troops after. Yes I like it!"
minipainting,3dlb7d,NightLancer,2,Fri Jul 17 05:32:52 2015 UTC,"yupp, but remember to try and keep the troops in a manageable number... i once made the mistake of trying to paint a whole imperial guard platoon in a single go... 40 Guardsmen.... god it was a nightmare..."
minipainting,3dlb7d,SocksOfDeath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:46:20 2015 UTC,Mental note Don't paint 100 boyz at once. Good call!
minipainting,3dlb7d,LorienWarden,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:33 2015 UTC,"Enter a local tournament that requires things to be painted. It always gets me motivated to paint. Just went through about 60 marines. And while theyre not jaw dropping, they are basecoated and ready for detail work!"
minipainting,3dlb7d,redpiano,2,Fri Jul 17 14:10:56 2015 UTC,This resulted in my first two painted armies. Nothing motivates like a deadline!
minipainting,3dlb7d,hillean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"I just did that with warmachine! Painted nearly 40 models, I need more tourneys!"
minipainting,3dlb7d,Greystorms,2,Fri Jul 17 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Just paint what you want to paint, I don't know about you buy I'll buy a model and then my interest in painting it will shift to a different model, so I put the previous model away on a shelf and don't even really bother with it."
minipainting,3dlb7d,Greystorms,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:27:24 2015 UTC,Having recently got into a buttload of different war games I think that's a great idea :D
minipainting,3dlb7d,DrStalker,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"Just take one thing at a time... I just finished painting all of my Imperial Assault set, and moved onto Descent.  I'll be on it for awhile, then will move onto BSG and Last Night on Earth"
minipainting,3dlb7d,my_mini_account,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:17 2015 UTC,"Keep everything manageable.  Meaning, don't have a dozen different projects out on your desk all at the same time.  Try to work on and finish one thing before moving on to the next.  Get that trukk painted, and then paint a small squad of boyz.  Then paint a Painboy.  And so on."
minipainting,3djbls,natorierk,5,Thu Jul 16 19:00:14 2015 UTC,"Looks like Tiamat, which I now want not knowing of its existence 20 minutes ago."
minipainting,3djbls,blither,6,Thu Jul 16 21:09:29 2015 UTC,It was showcased earlier in the year!  http://imgur.com/a/vofW6/noscript
minipainting,3djbls,Crepti,6,Thu Jul 16 21:15:13 2015 UTC,"I feel a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of wallets cried out in pain and were suddenly opened."
minipainting,3djbls,LaserPoweredDeviltry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:36:45 2015 UTC,Excellent. Was that from the annual Reaper con?
minipainting,3djbls,blither,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:27 2015 UTC,"I believe so. There are a load of the upcoming figures in those images, it seems."
minipainting,3djbls,Crepti,3,Thu Jul 16 21:34:09 2015 UTC,"The best part is, it'll probably cost $35-40, highly doubt it would be any more. Try finding a miniature the size of a toddler for that much anywhere else !"
minipainting,3djbls,Ass_Masster,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:59 2015 UTC,"It will probably be around $100 even after the kickstarter, based on some of the existing pricing like Dragons Don't Share and Kaladrax which is still insanely good for a ""miniature"" that size."
minipainting,3djbls,DrStalker,2,Fri Jul 17 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"On ebay Dragons Don't Share goes anywhere from the Kickstarter price of $35, to $75, and Kaladrax is around $50+, but I suspect Tiamat will cost $35 and be worth that $100, because its so over the top cool."
minipainting,3djbls,Ass_Masster,2,Fri Jul 17 04:37:21 2015 UTC,So about $800 from Games Workshop's Forge World?
minipainting,3djbls,DrStalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:18 2015 UTC,"I lucked out and picked up a Kaladrax in box for 13 bucks about a month ago from a ""garage sale"" at a local gaming shop. Really happy about that one. Got the clockwork dragon for $6 too."

minipainting,3djbls,Lakus,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:38 2015 UTC,"Fuck. Its not even August 2015, and I'm spending serious money for something that will be finished in September 2016. What is wrong with me. That cannon is sweet, though. And so is that other dude. And those dudes. And that chick. And those guys. And that one. And this. And, oooh look, one of those! That as well?! Oh, my!"
minipainting,3djbls,Bremic,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:31 2015 UTC,That cannon is worth waiting a year from spending the funds. I can't wait to make it into a warmachine objective and an Iron Kingdoms RPG plot device.
minipainting,3djbls,Leferikson,2,Thu Jul 16 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, the cannon is the first thing that I am not interested in, and I love WW2 games. Not sure why but I just don't think I would enjoy having this in my collection."
minipainting,3djbls,DrStalker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:03 2015 UTC,Double checked after reading your comment...fuck...it IS shipping in 2016 : (
minipainting,3djbls,Draeth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:04:38 2015 UTC,"On the plus side their shipping estimates are probably very accurate, given all their past experience."
minipainting,3dinab,redravon,3,Thu Jul 16 16:03:27 2015 UTC,The Blanchitsu is strong in this one.

minipainting,3djb2g,brianpi,4,Thu Jul 16 18:56:11 2015 UTC,150 Glass Beads on a string from Amazon. They fit in Vallejo droppers just fine.
minipainting,3djb2g,toqueville,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:03:46 2015 UTC,"Nice, and cheap too!"
minipainting,3djb2g,TheSheDM,3,Thu Jul 16 20:09:45 2015 UTC,"Here's something cheaper: $2.50 and free shipping    Ignore the pic showing huge 10mm beads. Pick the 4mm or 6mm, should fit just fine. 8mm is biggest I wouldn't go larger than that, some of my bottles have a pretty narrow opening."
minipainting,3djb2g,randomisation,2,Thu Jul 16 22:03:41 2015 UTC,"I use ceramic baking beads, which you can pick up fairly easily."
minipainting,3djb2g,SmallRealities,3,Thu Jul 16 20:19:06 2015 UTC,"As mentioned before, Ceramic or glass beads work well. As do Stainless steel ball bearings."
minipainting,3djb2g,Hunyock,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:17 2015 UTC,I bought a bag of tumbled glass bits from Walmart in the pet supplies section - I think they were for aquarium decoration.
minipainting,3djb2g,Mofiremofire,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:42 2015 UTC,6mm lava beads
minipainting,3djb2g,bluesman99999,2,Fri Jul 17 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"I use 5/16 inch, approximately 8mm, corrosion resistant grade stainless steel ball bearings. I bought a pack of 100 from amazon and loaded one per dropper bottle. I wanted heavy beads for shaking, so I looked into stainless steel instead of plastic. Glass would probably work well, too. I wouldn't go larger than 5/16 in or 8 mm, since the throat of my Vallejo bottles aren't much wider than that."
minipainting,3djb2g,Ass_Masster,2,Sat Jul 18 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"I use Metal BBs, work perfect inP3!"
minipainting,3djb2g,unidentifiable,6,Thu Jul 16 21:12:32 2015 UTC,iirc metal reacts funny to some paints. Rust and the like.
minipainting,3djb2g,AltansarSpiritseer,4,Thu Jul 16 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"I bet this isn't the first time /u/Ass_Masster thought, ""oh, shit...."""
minipainting,3djb2g,Ass_Masster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:25:03 2015 UTC,"In my experience it dose a tad, but its always at the bottom, and never interferes with the use or color of the paint. Plus the BBs are heavy and stir up very well."
minipainting,3djb2g,Ass_Masster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:41 2015 UTC,This might work well for me! You just throw one BB per bottle or more?
minipainting,3djb2g,laffatthemirror,2,Thu Jul 16 22:34:35 2015 UTC,"I usually do two just because. Sometimes the stick to the bottom, and get slight discoloration if they've been sitting for a few weeks, but I've never had it effect the color or texture of the pain and I've been doing it for a while."
