StrikeWitches,3db3u3,Blajous,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"Picture can be found here  Childhood friend of Lynette and attached to the 504th, that’s Patricia Shade. Based on the British flying ace Patrick Schade. Probs to Humikane for finding out about this ace, he’s a pretty unknown one. Born on the 15th July sometime before 1922 in Malaya, Schade joined the RAF in 1940. He started his career in a Hurricane in early 1941 but changed to a Spitfire Mk. V in July the same year. Without any luck over the Channel he transferred to Malta in early 1942 where he scored 14 kills. Leaving Malta in August as Malta’s then highest scoring ace. Back in the UK he served as a pilot trainer and test pilot but joined 91st Sqn. later on. From June 1944 he was tasked with destroying V1 flying bombs that targeted London. At the end of July he took of a last time in his Spitfire Mk. XIV to intercept a V1 flying bomb. In bad weather conditions he collided with a Tempest and died in the resulting crash. He died with 14 destroyed aircraft and 2 destroyed V1s written to his name.   Happy birthday!"

StrikeWitches,3bsy43,Blajous,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"Picture can be found on Pixiv  The best ground attack witch from Karlsland, Hanna U. Rudel, is celebrating her birthday on the 2nd of July. The most highly decorated ace of Germany during WWII, Hans Ulrich Rudel, is her ace archetype. Born on the same day in 1916 joined the Luftwaffe in December 1936 and finished his dive-bomber training on the Junker Ju 87 in 1938. Even though he was part of Fernaufklärungsgruppe 121 (germ. Range-Reconnaissance-Unit 121) at the beginning of the war in 1939, he transferred to StG168 on the 2nd March 1940 which was stationed in Caen, France. After a successful deployment with StG2 in Greece he took part in the invasion of the USSR. During the Siege of Leningrad he sunk the soviet battleship Marat on the twenty-third September 1941. He also was the first German pilot to fulfil 1000 sorties in Russia after he returned from an artillery raiding mission on the 2nd of February 1943. On the 14th April he was awarded with the Knight’s Cross with Oak Leaves after destroying 70 Russian landing craft in Kuban. On the 20th of March 1944 Rudel decided to fly 50km behind Russian lines to save a downed aircrew. His plane got stuck in the bog so he and his crew were forced to retreat on foot. While they were crossing the Dnieper River in Ukraine his radio operator which accompanied him for more than 1.400 missions drowned due to Soviet guard fire. On the 6th August 1944 he cracked his 300th tank. On New Year’s Day 1945 he got awarded the Goldenen Eichenlaub mit Schwertern und Brillanten zum Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes (germ. Knight's Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds) from Hitler himself. The highest Knight’s Cross which was ever awarded. On the 8th February his leg got severely injured by a 40mm Flak shell. He managed to land his aircraft safely on the runway before passing out where his gunner, Dr Ernst Gadermann, saved his life by strangulating his leg and rushing him to the field hospital. On the 8th of May he and his squadron flew to the American airfield at Kitzingen to surrender. After the war he escaped to multiple countries including, Argentina, Swiss and Italy. He died on the 18th December 1982 aged 66 in Rosenheim still as a supporter of the NSDAP and was buried on the 22nd. It came to a big dispute in German media because two Bundeswehr F-4 Phantom II’s flew over the burial ceremony. All due to the fact that the German government would love to forget about their WWII veterans.   Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!"

If anyone recalls the art style from somewhere, he drew some of the girls in Kancolle.  Fumika Kitagou, a witch from Fuso which was the teacher for many future aces including, Sakamoto, Takei and Wakamoto. It seems like her ace archetype is Nango Mochifumi who was born on the 1st July 1906. He joined the imperial Japanese air force and finished his naval flight training in 1932. Being the naval attaché in the Japanese embassy in London he returned to japan two years afterwards. In October 1937 he then was posted to 13th Air Group to fight in the Second Sino-Japanese War between China and Japan. In an engagement on the 2nd December 1937 he downed his first two Chinese aircraft and was stationed on the aircraft carrier Soryu later that month. In July 1938 Nango took over command of 15th Air Group in China where he, just like many other pilots from the 15th AG, became ill due to unsanitary conditions. On the 18th July 1938 he crashed into a Chinese I-15 biplane which was originating from the Soviet Union. With 8 destroyed hostile aircraft Lt. Nango died at the age of 32.  お誕生日おめでとうございます  This post isn't late at all."

The ace on whom she is based is the American pilot Carl J. Luksic. Born on the 20th June 1921 on Hawaii and joined the military in March 1942. In July 1943 he and his unit, the 487th Fighter Squadron moved from Massachusetts to England. There he attacked German logistical and strategic resources on the continental European, occupied continent with his P-47. He destroyed 7 German planes on the runway before he transitioned into the P-51 in April 1944. Between the 10th April and the 19th May he shot down 8 German aircraft by himself and shared one kill. On the 24th of May he then got shot down and became a POW. In March 1945 Lt. Luksic managed to escape the camp and made it back to the Allied lines on the 18th April. Shortly afterwards, in May 1945, he returned to the US to become a flight instructor. On the 1st of December 1969 he left the USAF with 15.5 destroyed aircraft in WWII. Colonel C. J. Luksic died on the 24th of May 2009 at the age of 87, 65 years to the day after he got captured by German troops.  Happy birthday!"

For instance, almost every character is based off of real aces from ww2 and the striker units (leg planes) are based off the fighters those aces used."

She is based on the Austrian ace Gordon Gollob which was born in on the 16th June 1912 in Vienna in former Austria-Hungary. In 1930 he joined the Austrian Bundesheer (germ. Federal Army) and after the Anschluss in 1938 he joined the Luftwaffe. In the spring of 1930 he was posted to ZG76 and took part in the invasion of Poland. On the 7th September 1940 he was posted to JG3 which saw night fights against the RAF over the channel. He and his unit were then posted to the eastern front to support the German invasion of the USSR. On the 26th October he got the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves for his 85 aerial victories. Later that year he was sent back to test new plane prototypes. Though his career didn’t stop there since he returned to the frontline in 1942. In August 1942 he was the first Luftwaffe pilot to get 150 kills. Soon later he took control of the German air force in the northwest of France. In January 1945 he then was appointed to General der Jagdflieger (germ. General of the fighter pilots) and stayed in that position until the surrender of Germany on the 8th of March 1945. He died on the 7th September 1987 aged 75.  Alles Gute zum Geburtstag!"

Tetsuko Wakamoto celebrates her birthday on the 14th of June which is a bit strange when it comes to the ace on whom she is based. The Japanese WWII ace Tetsuzo Iwamoto who supposedly is her ace archetype, not only has a different name but also a different date of birth. He was born one day later on the 15th June 1916 and joined the IJNAF in 1934 against the will of his parents. In late 1936 he then became a skilled pilot of the Zero fighter. In 1938 he then was sent to China, more specifically to the 13th Flying Group. On his first combat he shot down 4 soviet aircraft. His military career continued with the 13th FG through the Japanese occupied Chinese mainland. In September of 1938 he was sent back to Japan to become a flight teacher at the age of 22. At this point he had 82 confirmed destroyed aircraft* over China. He went on to survive the war and died 20th May 1955 at the age of 38 by the side of his wife after multiple operations. She later recalled that his last words were, ""When I get well, I want to fly again.""  お誕生日おめでとうございます  *His diary which was found after the war claimed 202 destroyed aircraft. This number was later corrected to the actual 82 kills."

StrikeWitches,38kz2n,Matt0218a,2,Thu Jun 4 22:02:03 2015 UTC,I try to think of the show as serious... Then I see the creator's super lewd drawings
StrikeWitches,38kz2n,itsRapeTime,2,Fri Jun 5 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"well, the show has serious implications. A lot of people die during it, although it's not explicitly shown. The movie is a prime example, where the neuroi wipe out an attacking force at the start of it. Ain't no way they're still alive, not to speak of the many times navy vessels have gotten full on hits from neuroi blasts.  but at the same time, ye, the creator does his lewd drawings. It's a bit in the middle. It's serious, but they make it a lot more lighthearted than you'd expect with what happens in the background of the series."

We are the Dead. Short days ago  We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  Loved and were loved, and now we lie  In Flanders fields.  Take up our quarrel with the foe:  To you from failing hands we throw  The torch; be yours to hold it high.  If ye break faith with us who die  We shall not sleep, though poppies grow  In Flanders fields."
