1200isplenty,3dwwik,TheAmbulatingFerret,5,Mon Jul 20 10:57:48 2015 UTC,"First off everything boils down to calories in, calories out. You could eat 1200 calories in butter and still lose weight. But I'm guessing your wondering more about how sugar in general is effecting your diet.  Sugar can be a bit difficult to work with in a diet partly because of how little people understand about it's roll in our diets. Too high of blood sugar and you can damage blood vessels, nerves, and increase your risk for heart disease. You can experience symptoms such as Fatigue, increased thirst, blurry vision, and frequent urination.   You do need some sugar in a diet, but the problem is you don't need a lot. Generally if you are eating fruits and veggies you are getting plenty of sugar which comes with a helping of fiber. The good news is that while sugar can cause your blood sugar to spike which will trigger insulin release from your body (which can cause irritability and hunger even if you just ate) fiber helps counteract high blood sugar.   The biggest culprit of going over on sugar goals commonly is; milk, (refined and unrefined)sugar, and fruit juice. The biggest issue with these three is that they don't come with any form of fiber to them and many times have little nutritional value for the amount of calories and sugar they pack into a portion.   Generally the way I count my sugar intake is similar to how many people count carbs. If my sugar comes with a helping of fiber I subtract that from my sugar totals for the day and as long as I don't go freakishly over my sugar goal don't worry about it because Type II Diabetes doesn't run in my family. So ask yourself if you are suffering from any of the symptoms of high blood sugar or have a family history of Diabetes. If you do, you might want to rethink your sugar goals and switch to sugar free items, more specifically sweeteners that are known to help balance out blood sugar such as stevia and xylitol."
1200isplenty,3dwwik,thebanditredpanda,2,Mon Jul 20 11:50:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for that info.

1200isplenty,3du54u,TheAngelErika,12,Sun Jul 19 14:51:52 2015 UTC,But I would assume the JIF has more air in it. Volume isn't as good a measurement as grams for serving sizes. The JIF is at 4.66 calories per gram and the PB2 is at 3.75 calories per gram. The PB2 though has sugar and salt in it and it looks like the JIF is more protein dense... hmm...  I think the JIF may be better all around due to the no added sugar/salt and higher protein density (which likely means more satiety)

Ever notice how Jif came out with ""almond butter"" and ""cashew butter"" a year or 2 ago and started selling them for $12 a pop? It might just be a personal choice, but I'd rather support Bell Plantation and their farms over a product under the umbrella of major industrialized farming that's not very good for our environment.

My family's business is in food packaging machinery so I guess I have a bit more insight as far as the differences between huge companies like Smuckers and their peanut suppliers vs others.

This is a version of how you should eat for the rest of your life. Is it sustainable never to have a reeses cup or a piece of birthday cake? I know I've read of people who do that, but I know I'm not that person. What I do instead is allow myself to be human. I have that cinnamon roll or whatever as long as it's in my calorie count. I don't beat myself up for it but I try to savor it and really make it something special not just absentmindedly stuffing my face. For me my main treat is ice cream. I usually have a half a cup to a whole cup of lite 120 cal ice cream every night. I save my calories for it and enjoy it really slowly. I eat lots of other healthy stuff and the majority of my calories are for healthy stuff but I do occasionally have a slice of pizza or a burger. I think it's all about learning moderation really.

My top five are baby spinach, romaine (I just buy the Andy Boy 3 pack and shred it up), spring mix, coleslaw (rainbow mix) or broccoli slaw mix and basic iceberg. So I swap around between all of those as my different salad bases, so that I don't get bored. I'll occasionally have kale or other lettuce blends if the price is good on them.   Topping ideas:  Berries/cheese/nuts - sound like you've already got that covered with the strawberry feta but have you tried mixing it up with different berries/cheeses.. I also like salads with blueberries, feta and slivered almonds. Walnuts or pecans taste great too with greens and fruits. Or goat cheese can be subbed in for a different flavour than the feta. Blue cheese is good with strawberries too in my opinion, the harder crumblier kind though not the really soft kind. (I know it's more of an acquired taste though). Blue cheese is also really good with pears and/or apples on top of a salad. Raspberries, strawberries and goat cheese. etc etc. Lots more combinations here if you introduce different fruits and cheeses.   Mexican/Tex-Mex: Black beans, cheddar, avocado, corn kernels, salsa, jalapenos, green onion, chopped peppers (like red bellpepper or orange pepper), chicken or leftover steak, mango. You don't have to do all of those ingredients, just pick a few based on what you have on hand and what fits into your calories. You can use salsa as your dressing, atlernatively Bolthouse Farms also has a ""salsa ranch"" yogurt dressing that is sold at Wal-Mart in my part of Canada, it's I think 20 or 25 cals per tbsp. President's Choice has these tortilla strip salad topping things, they're shelved with the croutons and they're really delish. Not like super-cal but if the rest of my salad is fairly low cal (lettuce, beans, veggies and salad), I'll throw a handful on because they make it feel more special like a restaurant salad.  Mediterranean Tuna - Tuna + greens + plus your standard greek salad type toppings - red onion, olives, feta, cucumber, cherry tomatoes or sundried tomatoes etc. Can obviously be done without the tuna for your basic greek salad.  Italian chickpea - Basically greens for the base, plus chickpeas and your fav Italian ingredients. I like sundried tomatoes, olives, mozzarella cheese (feta works fine too), jarred marinated artichokes (not the ones in oil though.. Unico brand is good and low-cal), jarred Italian peppers (Unico). Again, don't need all those ingredients, just pick the ones that fit into your calories. Kidney beans or white beans are fine if you don't have chickpeas. Season with Italian seasoning and dress with a basic vinagrette, super good!  Mandarin Chicken - Basically a copy-cat of the one sold at Wendy's or in restaurants as ""chinese chicken"" but without the crazy high calorie ramen noodles. You need greens (I like romaine best for this one), red onion, chicken, canned mandarin oranges (buy the ones packed in water NOT the ones packed in syrup), and nuts of choice (cashews, almonds, etc). Can add other veg if you wish, like cucumber, red pepper, onion, etc. I dress with one tablespoon of Renee's ""asian vinagrette,"" which is worth it IMO because you don't need a lot.   Thai style-salad - I like this one with a bag of those shredded carrot/cabbage blend as a base, or good with broccoli slaw as the base too. Add peanuts, mango, chicken or shrimp, cilantro, green onion, thinly sliced or chopped red pepper and cucumber. Good with any store bought dressing that is ""ginger/chili-soy/thai-style"" or just with a simple vinagrette made from a tiny bit of sesame oil, rice vinegar, soy and a pinch of honey or sugar. Add sirracha or other chili sauce if you like heat (I do!).   All the ones I've listed are obviously green salads but if think outside the box of lettuce there are also broccoli salads, beet salads, potato salads (sweet or white potatoes), egg salads, carrot salads, etc..."

Taco: salsa, light sour cream, jalapenos, grape tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, red onion, ground turkey & black beans cooked with taco seasoning, cheddar, and romaine (394 cal each jar)  Greek: garlic dressing, banana peppers, grape tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, kalamata olives, feta, grilled chicken, romaine (393 cal each jar)  I used MFP to plan up my recipes. You could easily tweak them to reduce the calories a bit by reducing or skipping the high cal things. I like my lunch to be about 400 cal so this is perfect for me.

Top with grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano before serving!  The kale holds up really well and makes good leftovers, which makes me think this salad would make a good make-ahead lunch. You can add toppings, but I prefer to keep the favors in this salad simple and bold.

Near the end of the cooking process, top two of the pieces with yogurt and sliced strawberries.  Take the other two pieces of toast and place on top of the yogurt and strawberries.  Top with more strawberry slices. Add maple syrup and enjoy!  *I used Vanilla but a lot of their flavors would work well (Toasted Coconut, Strawberry Cheesecake, etc.) Whipped cream cheese would also be good, but I wanted the added protein of the Greek yogurt.   This makes a super filling breakfast/brunch with 35g protein and ~17g fiber.

1200isplenty,3dr0ns,Penelope2124,5,Sat Jul 18 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"they're OK. expensive, convenience food (blah blah make it yourself; that's not what you're asking for) -- they taste decent, texture is fine. my issue with them is they don't keep well, even if totally sealed and fridged. I take it as a good indicator that they're not loaded down with preservatives but if you open the pack/box, expect to have to eat it all within a few days (like literally 2-3 days max). I personally loved the Caesar flavored chicken they used to have.  that said, if you want to experiment with your own again, I highly recommend brining the chicken breast in a salt solution (brine) before cooking. (just google it) -- salt water has a higher boiling/steam point so getting sodium into the meat keeps it juicier than cooking unbrined for the same length of time and temp. also, if you're grilling, do chicken thighs instead of breasts. the higher fat count gives you a way larger margin of error in terms of high heat, hard to spot control grilling."

Honestly, yeah, it's more expensive than doing it yourself, but I live alone and don't like to overbuy and subsequently have to throw out food (though I know you can freeze meat), and also am not much of a cook.

1200isplenty,3dr0ns,60g4496,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:47:13 2015 UTC,"Since I haven't tried the tjs chicken strips, I'll just offer a comment about the cooking problem. I make chicken breast a couple times a week, and it usually turns out great. The main things you can't skip with boneless skinless breast is either a simple salt brine for at least an hour, or marinating in some sort of acidic marinade for at least an hour, up to overnight.   If you like doing stir fries, check out the ""velveting"" technique. It involves adding some corn starch to a brine/ marinade (usually asian style for stir fry).  For example you would cut up the chicken, and mix it into a simple marinade of two tablespoons of corn starch, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, some mirin if you have some. This shouldn't add any calories and will make a huge difference in texture and juiciness.   Sometimes I'm lazy and just throw cubes chicken into a bowl and mix bbq sauce and some Worcestershire sauce and let it sit for an hour up to 24 hrs. Texture is more traditional and can get dry but it tastes good!"
1200isplenty,3dr0ns,eatingissometal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"It's a lot easier to cook chicken without overcooking it when you bake it instead of sauteeing it.  Just set the oven and set the timer.  Even easier (and more foolproof): get a meat thermometer with a probe on a cord.  You put the probe in the chicken, the oven door closes on the long cord, and at the end of the cord on your counter is the electric display.  Just set the display to 165 degrees F and it'll beep when it reaches that temp, and your chicken's done!  Not a second overcooked!  Slow cookers are also pretty foolproof for cooking chicken that isn't dry."

Load it up with protein and veggies, maybe even some cheese, a red sauce instead of white, and you can have a HUGE pasta dish for ~500 calories.

1200isplenty,3dktow,USB_everything,2,Fri Jul 17 12:36:24 2015 UTC,"here's a supplement free day with lots of protein: http://i.imgur.com/HjzBwIp.jpg   Dinner was homemade vietnamese lemongrass chicken bun salad then dessert was half a pear smeared in cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of brown sugar and roasted in the oven, served with a dollop of greek yogurt, and i logged 1/3 cup of almond milk for a coffee. breakfast was 2 coffees with almond milk and a wrap with 2 fried eggs with cheese and some green pepper. Lunch was 4 corn thin crackers (i like them so much more than rice crackers omg) with a can of tuna with mayonnaise, and then i had 1/2 a tblsp of peanut butter cause I was peckish before dinner.   and one with supplements http://i.imgur.com/rtfHMvi.jpg   Dinner was chicken breast grilled with parmesan cheese and garlic powder with steamed carrots and riced cauliflower with butter, then an almond milk protein shake, and then later on half a quest bar smeared with peanut butter and microwaved (so good). Breakfast I usually don't eat so it was just almond milk in my coffee Lunch was a wrap with 2 eggs, tomato and cheese. Then afternoon snack was another coffee with almond milk, some rice crackers and some peanut butter.   I love quest bars so I eat them as dessert a few times a week, and I do strength training 5- 6 times a week so I also like to have almond milk protein shakes most days. That's really the easiest way to get protein into a 1200 calorie diet, if you use almond milk you can get 24 grams of protein in like a 150 calorie shake. Also shakes are waaaay cheaper than protein bars.  BUT, you can totally do it with no supplements. All you need to do switch the focus of your meals so the main source of your calories is the thing you're getting the protein from. So for me I switch rice/noodles/sweet potato out from my dinners for low cal veges like zucchini and eat a bigger serve of whatever meat I'm having. Or if I make soup I'll have a bigger bowl instead of a small one with a bread rolls. Stir fry with extra veges and no rice. Those carby sides take up a lot of real estate!"
1200isplenty,3dktow,lespigeon,2,Fri Jul 17 16:37:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah before I got into calorie counting and knowing what macros are, I thought carbs meant starchy things like potatoes, pasta, bread, crackers, anything with flour really. It still kind of amazes me when I have a shit load of fruits and mfp tells me I went over my carbs limit, then I remember the natural sugars are also carbs. Ugh! Thanks for the meal ideas! I usually go for coconut milk instead of almond milk in coffee (unless I have the one with pre-added creamer) because... I don't know how to say this, but it seems to me like almond milk makes coffee taste rusty. Is it just me? I also got into eating salads almost every day but then again, quite a few of the veggies account for quite a few carbs, and I'm not yet used to having a lot of meat and fewer veggies (growing up the potatoes were always a bigger portion than the meat, haha). I keep hearing about quest bars but they're not available where I live, I should look for some replacement or local brand! Are they filling, do they satisfy a need for crunchy snacking? And those crackers sound good, are they like the round, expanded rice ones? (I assume those were the ones you were talking about when you said you liked the corn ones better but I'm not sure).

Deff have a look around and see if there's a version sold near you, they are great for snacks and lunches. I miss bread and crackers in general, but they make it bearable. (topped with ham and cottage cheese = low cal SUPER high protein snack)  And i don't think your alone in your almond milk hatred :P Maybe try one of the coconut/almond milk mixes? those seem really popular and might be a lower cal/carb option that doesn't taste like rusty nails?  As for quest bars, they are the best tasting protein bar around, (and they don't have any horrible... 'digestion' side effects if you eat more then one, like so many low carb/sugar free things). They're expensive, but I will happily eat one instead of like, a mars bar when I'm at the movies, or instead of cookies after dnner. They taste like they're bad for you, that's all i can say. There is no artificial sweet taste. Like, i've tried a LOOOOT of protein bars and low carb treat bars, and there is seriously no freaking comparison. And since they are so high protein, they are filling. I'm not sure where you live, but you can order them online from their website  and they deliver to australia, so they might ship elsewhere?  Buying a protein powder will be a lot cheaper than bars if you want an easy way to bump up your macros though. And you can shove powder in everything, like add some to overnight oats, or make protein pancakes or cookies."

That's only 1/2 the intake for a normal day, because I loved snacking. I thought grazing throughout the day was my best bet, especially because I'm a bored snacker. Even though I thought this worked for whatever reason, there was a lot of times I would end up going home at the end of the day (working afternoons) and eat all the food! Every time I would try a ""healthy lifestyle change"", this was my go-to plan and I would always fail in like.. A week.  This time I decided to try something different! Skip breakfast, big lunch, big dinner, and 2-3 small snacks. Wow. This made a huge difference! I don't eat anything until around 2-3pm (think of it like a small fasting period) and my lunches are ~400 calories, dinners around 500 calories, and 300 for whatever else. I feel full so much longer, and my mind isn't constantly on food. Believe it or not, it actually helped my craving for snacks. Sometimes in the morning I will feel a little hungry, but if I hold off for not even 5 minutes, it goes away. I'm not eating like a bird during my ""meals"". I don't feel like I'm depriving or restricting myself of anything like I used to. Small meals and snacks all day are not filling to me.. Constantly eating made sure I never felt actually hungry, but it never left me full, which is why I would end up bingeing.   If anyone else is the grazing type of person I used to be, and you're not sure how well it is working for you, try making your meals bigger for one day and see how you like it! I would slowly lose 2-3 lbs and fall off the wagon (gain it back), but with my new food schedule, I've already lost 6 lbs and still motivated :)"

Stevia is a plant native to Paraguay that’s been used to sweeten foods and beverages for more than 200 years. It’s really good. We use it as a sugar replacement. Erythritol has a funny name, but it’s another all-natural sweetener. It’s found in things like pears and grapes and has naturally been in our diet for a looooong time. It’s technically a sugar alcohol, but that’s kinda misleading because it’s in a class apart from the other sugar alcohols. For example, erythritol doesn’t affect blood glucose or cause bloating."

And get some prenatal vitamins if you haven't already.  The symptoms you've mentioned may well be due to the pregnancy. Your body has lots of fun hormones right now. I got very clumsy and couldn't word well and I got sciatica (boo). Maybe pick up a book or browse a site or two about early pregnancy symptoms (avoid scary things) and you'll see what I mean.

Cook covered for another 8 minutes then add spinach and recover. They're done when all veggies are soft and a small amount of sauce has been made on the bottom from the juices and tomato paste.

1200isplenty,3de7zt,sat52,12,Wed Jul 15 17:50:30 2015 UTC,Make your own taco seasoning!  Going to second lime and cilantro. Those are flavour gods for Mexican cooking. You may not even notice the lime but it does something special! I would mix it in with the rice after it's done cooking.  Definitely cook your meat with some sort of tomato sauce. Like you're making a ragu. It will keep it moist and yummy.
1200isplenty,3de7zt,craaackle,9,Wed Jul 15 16:36:03 2015 UTC,Whenever I make taco meat I add a can of low salt roasted diced tomatoes to the meat and let it cook down (simmer until much of the liquid is gone). This helps the flavor immensely.   Edit: I also might mix some lime/cilantro/salt into the corn

Brown one cup of rice in  a bit of oil/spray/butter stirring frequently. After its a bit toasted pour in 2 cups of water with a bouillon cube. Bring to a boil and cover. Turn the flame all the way down and cook for twenty minutes or until liquid seems to be gone. The trick is to turn off the flame and DO NOT open the lid for ten minutes after or at any point during the cooking process. Once Done, fluff rice with a fork and I swear it's heaven. Also for Spanish rice I add about 3 ounces of tomato sauce with seasonings to the liquid before cooking. It always turns out wonderful and fluffy."

I also highly recommend cooking your own cilantro-lime rice. I usually just add 2-4 limes worth of juice (depending on how much rice I'm cooking) to the water and then chop up some cilantro and add it in as soon as the rice is done cooking. Really easy and tastes awesome!

You don't have to add lots of sugar, and canned peaches or homemade apple sauce will have been cooked enough to get rid of the enzymes you can't handle.

You can ask, but since you say you want to avoid looking picky, it might be best to let that go.   I know a lot of restaurants have seafood teppan options like scallops, shrimp, ahi tuna and salmon, and there should be tofu as well. Since your work is paying for it, I'd spring for a scallop or tuna option since the portion size doesn't tend to be as large (it's pricy!). Assuming that most people will be getting beef/chicken, that means your scallop/tuna will probably be cooked separately so you can ask them to use less oil/butter pretty easily.  You can also usually get sushi/sashimi, but I feel like that might not be a good idea at a work function.

I whisked the full package with the milk first so the powder and the milk emulsifies first? not sure if I'm using that term properly sorry.  after the pudding started to take form and get thick, I poured in 1/2 cup of cold water slowly while whisking.   I weighed the pudding then divided evenly, by weight, into the individual Keebler mini graham cracker crusts which are 100 calories each.  turned out to be approx 150 each because I did a tiny dab of light whipped cream on each, though for anyone wanting to try this, I suggest NOT putting the whipped cream onto the pie until day of eating.

I'm sorry y'all, I'm sure it's a great sub if you're serious about low carb, but that cauliflower smell/taste just overpowers everything. Same goes for pizza crust. I can eat it broiled with curry powder or steamed and covered in my almond milk cheese sauce but as a carb sub? Nah, no way man."

Like.. if it's going to take me an hour to make a pizza crust between washing the cauliflower, chopping it, food procressing, pressing the water out of it, grating the cheese and stuff to mix into it, on and on just to make a pizza crust.. plus, it's creating dirty dishes which is more clean up time too! It's just so fussy and time-consuming just to make some mock pizza, and I say that as someone who actually enjoys cooking. But I'd rather just budget in the carbs from something like a tortilla and throw together a tortilla pizza (just take a whole wheat tortilla and add a bit of sauce, cheese, some veggies, bake in oven briefly and it's like a very thin crust pizza). Also when I tried the pizza crust it fell apart  even though I througly pressed the water out of the cauliflower and did all the proper pre-baking of the crust etc.   I actually like the cauliflower rice and don't find it overpowering at all but for me it's too fussy to make on a regular basis. When I make regular rice it's water and rice in a single pot, simple clean up and simple prep. Cauliflower rice is more stuff to wash, much more time, etc. We don't have Trader Joe's in Canada so stuck making it from scratch. Also cauliflower is also like 4-5$ per head where I shop unless it's on sale and that only makes a small amount of rice (I cook for several people right now and try to keep food budget somewhat reasonable) versus a massive bag of brown rice that will last months is like 10-12$ and has hundreds of servings in it."

If you are then you could easily make breakfast and lunch in your room without having a kitchen.  Examples: Overnight oats for breakfast, Bean salad for lunch. Sandwiches, salads, they all don't need a kitchen. Plus if you also have access to a microwave, you'll have even more options.   Plan your meals ahead of time and use common sense. Most schools will post the menu in the dinning hall online every day (mine always did). Also, you might start to notice trends. At my school Tuesday was Taco Tuesday, Thursday was Chicken Wrap Thursday, every other Wednesday they had pot stickers and rice, etc. Decide what your going to eat in the morning and stick with it! Also, use common sense. Buffalo Mac'n Cheese? Sounds delicious but not very low cal.  Look up the calories in a meal similar to what you're eating, if you can't find the nutrition facts on the food services website. Let's say you get an egg and cheese sandwich. Look up the calories in a typical egg and cheese sandwich and record that. The hardest part will be figuring out the portion size they give you. You'll just have to eyeball that I guess. You could try to look up pictures of the portion size you want to eat.  Does the dinning hall have a salad bar? That's going to be your best friend. The college I went to had one and you had to weigh your salad in order to determine how much it cost (we use the fake money system instead of getting x number of swipes and being able to eat as much as you want). That would make it a little easier to determine the number of calories   Finally, there may be lower calories options available that you won't know about, because your a freshmen. In the egg sandwich and omelet lines at my old school you could ask for egg whites but that option was never listed on the menu anywhere. You had to ask. And I had no idea that was something you could get until I was a sophomore. In the deli, you could order a low cal wrap but that wasn't listed as an option anywhere either. Ask around, and don't be afraid to ask the servers/chefs if there are other options."

It is good (and very motivational) that you don't let it hinder you, it would be an easy excuse aha!  Yep, (look at different macro splits. Some people say 40/40/20 is the best, but take that with a grain of salt. There is little scientific evidence of a 'best' split, so try out some and see how your body reacts. Try to get 0.6-8g of protein per lbs. So aim for around 100g if possible. Or go for 1g per kg and aim for 70+g. Probably about a third of your intake.) Protein is also very filling which helps stop snacking if that is a problem - for me, nuts, pb or Greek style yogurt are my go to high protein snacks which help me stay on track when I get other cravings.   I would suggest you don't give up on your results just yet, give it another week or so, and see if you look better (ignore the scale!). If there are inches off, great! If not be prepared to change up your cal and macro targets. Try high protein, which will help you retain muscle as fat burns off (this will disrupt the linear decrease of the scales however, but will leave you lean as you bf% drops). Perhaps using a (good) heart rate monitor would help figure out your true TDEE (please do not use gym monitors on the equipment, they can be very inaccurate). Time yourself on your cardio and set goals. Try to swim further or faster, it will help stop plateaus, and hopefully give motivation towards the target. As long as you have Cals in below Cals out, your bf% will drop, even if your scales deceive you (waterweight and general scale accuracy can also give the impression of no progress, when your mass has infact decreased).  You could also see about getting bf% and body scanning readings. That is up to you and can cost if there is nothing free nearby, but would help give a clearer indication on your progression.  It is all very hearsay, and I can only suggest as it is an exact science (or magic) and varies for everyone. Take some measurements and report back in a week? Or PM me if you have any specific questions and I can help out. 1lbs a week is a good drop for the scales, and that is at a 500cal cut under TDEE. Don't be scared if you lose weight slowly, it will only benefit you and hopefully make the journey less treacherous and unpredictable.  Lastly, trust in yourself and the science! Even if you do not drop on the scales, you will be fitter, stronger and all the better for getting out and doing something!"

Keep in mind that muscle weight is denser than fat, and it can sometimes seem like you haven't lost weight, when you've really been losing fat and building muscle.

1200isplenty,3d0gs3,tikislut,4,Sun Jul 12 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the scale is a unreliable friend. It definitely measures how much you and everything inside of you weighs in that moment, but 55-60% of you is water, and there's always an unknown/varying amount of food weight floating around in your guts, as well.  Water is not a part of scale weight that you can control. Tons of things affect how much water your cells hold onto. Some of these things include changes in diet, changes in exercise routine, your period, alcohol intake, carb intake, and much more. Take heart. The tide can mask real actual weight loss on even a week to week basis. If you're still losing inches, it's a good sign that all is still well.  For a helpful anecdote, in the past I have been multo-obsessive about calories and went too low for a time. Three weeks passed with no change in my weight in spite of my obsession, then suddenly, boom, a swoosh, and there it was on the scale at last. As long as you are diligent about weighing food and getting verified calorie counts from USDA's website and being super honest, you're golden. The scale, however, is often NOT golden. It is a mysterious, fickle beast."

I'm 5'4"", currently 128lbs, and I've been stuck here for almost 3 weeks, despite averaging just under 1200 each week. I've also been running a little, but nowhere near as much exercise as you. I log EVERYTHING and make sure it's super accurate, so it's not an error there on my part. I'm hoping that it's just some odd plateau and I shed a couple pounds at once soon, but it's discouraging for sure!"

I eat it over spinach or rice, and usually add some cheese. Pro tip for the spinach: steam it in the microwave for ~45 seconds, it makes it softer and easier to eat with the casserole.  Adapted from this recipe - I basically simplified it, added more chickpeas, and made it more tomatoey  Makes: 8 1-cup servings (225 cal/serving)   1 28oz can crushed tomatoes 2 15oz cans chickpeas, drained 1 large eggplant (mine was 22oz) 1 6oz can tomato paste 1 onion, chopped 4-6 cloves garlic, minced 3 tbs olive oil   Prepare the eggplant:   Preheat oven to 450 degrees Line baking sheet with foil Chop eggplant into 1/2in cubes and brush with 1tbs olive oil Bake in oven for 15 minutes Remove from oven once slightly browned; cover with another sheet of foil to allow eggplant to continue to steam.  Turn oven down to 350 degrees.   Meanwhile, prepare the tomato sauce:   Heat pot over medium heat, add 2tbs olive oil and sauté the onion and garlic.  Add the can of crushed tomatoes, can of tomato paste, and chickpeas.  Bring to a simmer and simmer it uncovered for 15-20 minutes, until it thickens up   Prepare the casserole:   In an oiled 2-quart baking dish, layer your ingredients. Begin with sauce on the bottom, then 1/2 the eggplant, more sauce, the other 1/2 of the eggplant, and top off with sauce.  Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes—it should be bubbling when you remove it.  Allow to cool for 15 minutes and then serve."

That won't ruin your pan but it will allow the iron to permeate the oil coating.   Also, side note, iron is much better absorbed by your body when taken with vitamin C, and it's absorption can be inhibited by things like calcium. But definitely talk to your doctor before taking extra supplements, since iron can also be toxic if you take too much!  Source of knowledge: I'm a vegan with low iron stores.

If you're considering trying animal products oysters (you can get them smoked and in a can, they're not gross I swear! and not super expensive) are 150ish cal. and high in iron. They also fill you up because of the protein.   If you can get red meat into your diet it would be a good idea to do so.

Give yourself as many veggies as you like, and pay attention to your macros (prioritize fiber, protein, fats, complex carbs over simple carbs and sugars).  Err on the side of slightly overestimating calories than underestimating.  If you do want to snack, it's in your favor to plan ahead. Bring popcorn, protein bars, sugar free jello cups, mixed nuts, whatever suits your fancy so you know you have safer options.  As for cafes and restaurants, do you like black coffee or tea? Those would be better options than smoothies/juices. And the usual tips, like try to choose veggies/lean meats over fried foods.

No I do not freeze any of these meals since I eat them all within 3-4 days. These aren't meant to portray everything I eat daily, but just serve to be quick meal options because of my busy schedule. Otherwise I wraps, salads, soups, parfaits, etc...  these are in order as they appear,  meal 1 - breakfast burritos - cook the turkey bacon on a pan. while that cooks I microwave the Banquet brand light breakfast sausages, each link equates to about 37 calories. dice up some red/green bell peppers and sautee in a pan a bit before adding one serving size of egg beaters. then I use Fiber One 80 calorie wraps and throw the whole mess together.  meal 2 - wild rice w/ shrimp - I thawed pre-cooked shrimp, it's faster to deal with, and seasoned with cayenne, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper. I cooked a box of the wild rice, I believe it was Uncle Ben's and let that sit to absorb every bit of water. I used another pan and slow boiled a bag of mixed veggies. I then steamed a bag of cauliflower in the microwave. Last step, I pan cooked the shrimp about 3-4 minutes on high heat, constant stirring, Pam spray in a pan.  meal 3 - light alfredo penne pasta w/ shrimp/chicken sausage - slow boil the penne pasta. while that is going, I crack open a jar of Prego light alfredo and simmer on low heat, covered. cook the Thin n Trim brand chicken sausage covered with a little water on medium heat in a pan. seasoned the shrimp with cayenne, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder and start cooking high heat in a pan. dice the green/red bell pepper and don't cook, I wanted crunchy peppers on the day I eat. the chicken sausage is 70 calories per link, I slice half a link for each of these cups. the shrimp came out to about 8 per container for 30 calories.   meal 4 - light alfredo cheese ravioli w/ spinach and chicken sausage - still having that light alfredo on a low simmer and half links left from the chicken sausage. I opened a pack of premade cheese ravioli and boiled for about 4 minutes, then portioned about 4 each, which equated to 60 calories. I threw spinach leaves in a pan with a little water and covered, cooked on medium for about 5 minutes while stirring every minute. after spinach is soft, I threw them in with alfredo sauce.   meal 5 - chili w/ meatless crumbles - I buy this box of Lightlife brand meatless soy crumbles, it's 60 calories per 2 ounce serving so I just do the math of total weight and divide. I start the chili with a big can of diced tomatoes on low heat. I then throw in 1 tablespoon chili powder, 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin, 1/2 tablespoon black pepper, 1/2 tablespoon salt, 1/2 tablespoon paprika, and 1/2 tablespoon cayenne. then a whole can of beans, your choice. then diced red/green bell peppers. I cook for 30 minutes on medium-low heat covered.   meal 6 - cheese tortellini w/ plain pasta sauce and chicken sausage - open a bag of premade cheese tortellini and boil for about 4 minutes. simmer the plain pasta sauce, I buy the supermarket brand that equates to 20 calories per 1/4 cup. also simmer a can of diced tomatoes with the pasta sauce. sautee the diced mushrooms and onions. the chicken sausage are half link portions I had left from the other meals.   meal 7 - beef stew - this was a pain in the ass, I only did it to see if I could and stay within my calorie limits. I looked for the leanest cut of beef I could find, I chose the eye of round steak not roast. according to nutrition sites, 4 ounces equates to around 190 calories so I tried to keep each serving at 2 ounces. the rest is just normal beef stew, minus flour, oil, corn starch, yada yada. beef stock, water, sliced carrots, white potatoes, and celery slow cooked for about 2 hours.   meal 8 - random soup is just random soup haha left over rice and squash in the fridge and whatever else was still on the counters after other meals."

1200isplenty,3crd6r,eatgeeksleeprepeat,6,Fri Jul 10 12:27:01 2015 UTC,"The app I use is called Lose It and I use a food scale to evenly measure portions. Easiest way for my to measure and portion it to take the numbers on the nutrition facts and do some quick math.   For example,  If a box of rice says each serving is 150 calories and there are 2 servings in a box, I add up the total calories (300) and cook the whole box. After the rice is finished, I weigh the rice and divide evenly into 6 portions, which would yeild around 50 calories per container. I'm not sure if this is the most accurate way, but it's worked out for me so far.  When it comes to more complicated items like the chili, I will measure all ingredients separately before combining in the pot, meat last. Then I weigh the chili after it's finished cooking, straining solids from liquids. I then evenly distribute the solids to each container and once at an even weight, I evenly distribute the liquid. The meat is added last to ensure I've properly portioned everything.  I have some extreme OCD tendencies when it comes to this stuff :P"

This is also a pound of food. It's all I've eaten so far today and Im not really sure what to do because I'm super full hours later.    The recipe is super simple.   Slice veggies into forkable bites and set aside.  Zoodle a zucchini and set aside.  Cut chicken breast into nice bite size pieces. Spread chicken out well-spaced in one layer across a largish pan over moderate heat. Sprinkle with choice of seasonings. (I used 1 TBS garlic powder, 2 tsp ginger, 1 tsp ground red pepper, 2 tsp salt) When chicken has begun to brown a bit on one side, turn each piece. Sprinkle the newly exposed chickens with your seasoning. When all chickens have been turned, spread your veggies in an even layer over the chicken. After ~5 minutes  pour almond milk into pan. (You can use coconut milk for more richness, but I didn't have any on hand.) Add 1 tsp fish sauce and ~ 1 TBS ponzu to pan. Stir the mixture together until evenly distributed. I make sure to scrape all the delicious bits up that  may have adhered to the bottom of the pan.  Spoon in your PB2 powder. I used 2 TBS, but you can adjust according to taste. The PB2 does thicken up the sauce considerably. At this point I crank the heat to high to get the sauce bubbling and thicken a bit then serve. The zoodles were literally just heated in a skillet with a TBS of soy sauce until hot."

I don't really do 'cheat days' or 'cheat meals' because I feel like I would get into the mentality that I'm depriving myself the rest of the time. I'm actually maintaining my weight now, but if I've got a meal out coming up, or family visiting with lots of yummy food planned I'll cut back on my calories for a few days beforehand and afterwards to compensate. For example, I cut back to 1400 calories last week as my parents were visiting. I ate A LOT of really calorific food (pizza, burgers, milkshakes, gelato, dim sum... I regret nothing) over the weekend and didn't bother counting any of it (it would have just made me feel guilty and I wanted to enjoy myself!). But it's Thursday now and after a few days at 1200 and LOTS of water I'm back at my usual weight. Most of it was water weight!  My cheat meal of choice varies. Tomorrow the huzbone and I are going for dim sum and I am planning on eating way too much and then sitting in the sun and tanning my pot belly. :)"

I mean, I still count them every day, but I mainly worry about whether I was over or under for the week rather than the day. So, I do have days where I eat more than others, and work to balance it out over the course of the week a little more. I also have days where I plan out a splurge (I know it's semantics, but I have the idea of ""cheating"") Sometimes, I just plan on having more than my usual calorie allotment. Other times, I will eat back my exercise calories to fit something in. Every once in awhile, I eat all the way up to my TDEE. But I never eat more than that. I see it kind of like budgeting. I'm okay with saving less than normal, or not saving at all on the occasional basis, but I'm not okay with going into debt."

1200isplenty,3coek5,technicolorparadise,7,Fri Jul 10 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"I let myself have cheat days, but under sort of special circumstances. For example, this weekend we're celebrating my SO's birthday, and we want to go out to eat. I don't want to try and stay under 1200 calories when we're having a fun day, so I'm just being really good all week. I did the same for the 4th last weekend. Other than that, on ONE day a week I'll be a little more lax, but not straight-up cheat (something like I'll let myself get an iced coffee with SUGAR from dunkin donuts, lol). If I go a little over, I just shrug it off as long as it's below my TDEE. Cheat days usually go above my TDEE."
1200isplenty,3coek5,craaackle,6,Thu Jul 9 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"Yes and no? I don't consider any food strictly off-limits. If I can fit it into my calorie goals for the day, great! If I can't, then am I sure I want to eat it? Often times the answer is ""Nah, I don't need it today. Maybe next time, oatmeal cookie."" Sometimes the answer is ""Hell yes!"", like splurging on dinner and dessert at my best friend's birthday without worrying about counting calories. However, those days that I do splurge are usually preceded and/or followed by days that I really watch what I eat and aim for slightly under my calorie goal. Over the week, it all balances out.    For some people, they would consider this ""cheat meals"" or ""cheat days"". I just consider it part of my ""everything in moderation"" healthy lifestyle. Personally, too much focus on ""cheating"" makes my brain think that a) Certain foods are ""bad"" and off limits. This just makes my brain want them more. b) This diet is temporary behavior that can change once I reach my goal weight, rather than permanent lifestyle changes."

So cheat meals in the sense that I'm not sticking to 1200 cals on those days, but they're not full out binges either and I still try to make healthy choices, be conscious of calories and watch everything that goes in my mouth. For me, my TDEE (ie. maintenance if I were to maintain my current weight) is like 1700 calories so I can eat up to 1700 calories or so without gaining any weight back.. that gives me 500 extra calories which is enough to do like a beer, and a burger at a family BBQ, or potentially a restaurant meal, or something else that's hard to fit in at 1200 cals. Additionally, I'll usually exercise the day before/after I do something like that to make sure I'm burning a bit extra with exercise too. So I do this occasionally but I'd rather call them ""maintenance calorie"" days then cheat days. I think cheat days can easily get out of control, if it's literally a eat anything you want day.

I logged the calories, ate lighter the next day and didn't worry about it! I guess I don't worry about it because I try to do it very rarely and know a few extra calories every now and again really don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.  Also, not sure if this counts but I always go over 1200 if I do heavy/strenuous exercise. For example, on days like yesterday where I did a half-day straight hike up a mountain I went way over my limit--I burned ~1500 calories on the hike and ate 2000 calories for the day and still felt like I could have eaten more.

This dish is highly customisable; feel free to add or remove ingredients as you need. I had red bell peppers and bean sprouts (I needed to use these up fast) and cilantro and scallions and I like the colour in my fried rice so I added them. But bean sprouts are completely optional.   Ingredients:   4 oz chicken breasts, cut into thin strips 1 Tbsp soy sauce 1 Tbsp oyster sauce 1/4 tsp sesame seed oil 1 tsp brown sugar 1/4 tsp red chilli flakes 2 Tbsp Vegetable/canola/Peanut oil 1 medium clove garlic, minced 25g yellow onion,chopped into medium dice 25g red bell pepper, sliced into thin 1"" strips 200g riced cauliflower 1 large brown egg, beaten slightly to mix white and yolk 2 Tbsp cilantro 2 Tbsp scallion, greens only, chopped fine 1 cup bean sprouts 20g unsalted roasted peanuts, chopped roughly   Method:  Mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, brown sugar, red chilli flakes together in a small bowl to combine. Marinate the chicken with half of this. Save the rest for later.   Heat pan on fairly high heat (a bit higher than medium high). When the pan is hot, add 0.5 Tbsp of oil and give it a few seconds to just start to release the first wisp of smoke.   Add the chicken and stir fry vigorously for 1 min so all sides are browned. Remove to a bowl for later.   Wipe the pan with a piece of paper towel and add 1 Tbsp of oil. When the oil is hot, add the garlic and stir for 5-10 seconds before adding the onions. Stir these for 30 seconds. Now toss in the red bell pepper and stir for another 30 seconds.   Add the riced cauliflower and stir for 1-2 minutes to fry everything. Push everything to the sides to make a well in the middle. Add the remaining 0.5 Tbsp of oil and add the egg. Give the egg 30-45 seconds so the bottom just starts to set before scrambling it up to mix with the vegetables.   Add the leftover marinade/sauce and the chicken and fry for a minute.

1200isplenty,3co50x,yomaster19,17,Thu Jul 9 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"What are your stats and do you know your TDEE? 1200 may be too low. This happened to me last time I tried to eat 1200/day, I had one really bad day at a buffet and fell off the wagon for 6 months. Now I'm back on and doing better. I allow for one ""cheat"" day where I eat up to my TDEE. But I would try maybe eating a little more if you're feeling insatiable but still under your TDEE. I plan my week ahead of time and aim for 1000 calories...this allows me to have a late-night snack, or if I don't have a snack, I just bank those calories for a later date during the same week.  It's never too late to hop back on the wagon. Just learn from this experience and leave it behind you. Don't give up all that weight that you've lost. You didn't lose it all in a day and likewise one day will not ruin you either. If you've been over 2000 calories for a while, just try reducing to maybe 1800 and go from there. Find a number you're comfortable with that's still below your TDEE. There's no rule that says you HAVE to lose 1-2lbs a week."

I too went to a ribfest a few weeks ago, and I just continued doing 1200 a day afterwards. It's best to just not buy snacks at all I find, and find an activity to take up your time that can not involve snacking.    I did lose a lot of weight, and am almost wondering if my body is just not comfortable at this level.   Your body is comfortable at whatever level you feed it. I'm sure my body used to be pretty comfortable when I would have a Baconater, frosty and fries for lunch 2-3 days a week, but now it's fine with having a 200~ calorie salad."

Or if you must have them individually portioned out before you start snacking..don't eat from the cookie box...take out 2-3 cookies and go somewhere else and put the cookies away before you even take your first bite. I love ziplock bags for this purpose. I'll even put shredded cheese in them so I know exactly what 1oz is instead of just pouring it from the bag.

Slowly work down to that level, but you will be able to lose while still eating more than that for awhile.   Slow and steady.  You have had success with this in the past, but perhaps because it was at such a deficit, it burnt your body out. Try slowly easing down to that point.   This isn't an all or nothing scenario. There is a huge lay of land between 2000 and 1200. Find a comfortable spot for yourself, and set up shop."

To put things into perspective, I'm 5'3"" and under 100 lbs, so theoretically, I'm an ideal candidate for 1200 cals right? Short and small.  Like you, I did great for about a few months. I think I lost weight/inches (didn't track, but noticed comments). I was very active physically and ate back my exercise calories, so averaged approx 1500 cals a day. Not too severe a restriction, right?  And then like you, suddenly it wasn't enough. Cheat days exploded into cheat freakshows, and the residual guilt would really screw with my head. Getting back was hard, and I'd fall off again, rinse repeat...ended up with full on BED, which is just such a joy.  I'm not saying that 1200 will give you an ED, but it sounds to me like your body is asking for more calories (IMO, intuitive eating is real and is a thing, and if you want more discipline, IIFYM sounds perfect).   If anything, maybe you could up your calories and watch the percentages - more fat, more protein, more complex carbs? As scary as it sounds, try upping it for a week or two, see what it does to your progress, and adjust accordingly.  That's my two cents, anyway. Hope it helps."

I personally dry it out constantly during my grating process, laying it on paper towels and pressing it down on a strainer, as well as microwaving it on the paper towel. I find those are pretty successful."
1200isplenty,3cjm29,jalapeno_jalopy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of cauliflower pizzas. The tea towel method works well, but it's fairly labor-intensive.  Another cauliflower crust recipe I read stressed the importance of squeezing as much moisture as possible.  Apparently, the less moisture remaining, the chewier the crust will be (vs. crumbly).  I also heard that a potato ricer works well.  I bought one and tried it out. My experience was that I could only use the ricer with small batches, so it took a long time.  Also, pulsing the cauliflower in a food processor works really well and will definitely be quicker than manually grating."
1200isplenty,3cjm29,HolgerBier,8,Sat Jul 11 01:20:59 2015 UTC,"Just made it, good recipe and less sensitive to messing up than you'd expect. I forgot to microwave the cauliflower and bake the crust before putting on toppings cause reading is hard, but it worked out nonetheless.   I also found that manually grating the cauliflower is a PITA, and a kitchen machine did the job just fine for both the cauliflower as well as the mozzarella.   For any Dutch people here, cauliflower and chorizo are in the Bonus at the Albert Heijn, no better time to try it out than now."

I know I didn't include instructions for the actual grating--I figured people have different methods they may prefer.

I let my fats and carbs fall where they may, but I DO avoid ketosis (I hate slipping in and out of it because keto flu always hits me hard), so I definitely shoot for at least 30g of carbs per day, which isn't difficult. (Accidents do happen though.)  For the most part I aim for 90% nutritious and 10% vice, so on weekdays my log tends to be 5-10 servings of veggies & fruit a day, lean meats & often fish, small amounts of nuts, dairy, and weekends tend to have a little more wiggle room and there's the occasional cookie or nachos (or whatever)--but it's still overall a far more nutritious day than past me would have had. I do limit fruits, but not in a draconian way, and not because they are unhealthy. Veggies just tend to be overall more beneficial, health-wise, so I shoot for 1-2 servings of fruit (I prefer berries and bananas, but tend to go for what's seasonal anyway).

I take a multivitamin and fiber supplements to make sure I'm getting the micronutrients I need.  I do three meals per day plus snacks. Breakfast is ~100-200 calories, lunch ~300, dinner ~400. Snacks are usually fruits and veggies. I do have a small hoard of low cal chocolatey snacks, though (sugar free pudding, greek yogurt pops, mini ice cream cones, etc.) that I'll dip into as a snack, too."

Overall my diet tends to veer moderate to high fat, moderate protein and then low-ish/low end of moderate for carbs (not like keto or paleo low because I eat fruit and other stuff but I would say low-ish compared to the standard American diet.. I've cut back on bread, bagels, etc a lot). Although I do have days where carbs are a lot higher because I still have some rice or pasta or a tortilla or whatever now and then, I just try to keep my portions reasonable with carbs and not make them the bulk of my diet or a daily thing. Fat I don't worry about either way because the fats I do eat are healthy things like avocado, nuts, natural peanut butter, olive oil, etc. So as long as the calories fit in, I don't freak out about having 50 g fat in a day or whatever. I look at sugar too to make sure foods I'm choosing don't have an excess of added sugar (like sauces, yogurts, stuff like that can have sneaky sugar!) but again, I don't stress that much about sugar.. MFP says to have 35 grams of sugar per day but it doesn't differentiate between added sugar versus natural sugar and if I have two servings of fruit in a day, plus a big serving of carrots and say some bell peppers or something that's often enough to go over my sugar for the day just from natural fruits and veg! I take a women's multi-vitamin and overall eat a pretty varied diet (meat, eggs, fish, lots of greens and other veggies, fruit, lentils and beans, dairy etc) so generally I don't worry about micronutrients too much.  I try to have three balanced meals without a lot of snacking, although I will do a snack if I really need it, or had a long work-out or anything like that. So snacking isn't off-limits per se.. but one of the reasons I'm overweight is that I snacked/grazed a lot on too much food, even often on healthy food and I don't have good control if snacks are around or in front of me. I'm not a person who can easily have 6 almonds as my snack and then cut myself off. If I do snack I go for small single-portioned type item usually under 70 calories, like a cheesestring, a small piece of fruit, a few carrots and a spoonful of hummus, stuff like that. Generally though I try not to snack and I try to do 250-300 cals at breakfast, 300-400 at lunch and that usually leaves around 500-600 for dinner. That kind of a breakdown works well for me feeling level and energized throughout most of the day, feeling like I""m able to have a nice big dinner but it doesn't really leave calorie room for a lot of snacks."

Those are for in case I get hungry for a snack or to bulk up a meal. If they're leftover at the end of the day, I get a treat, lol."

If I want to lose 1lb a week I need ~3500 deficit for the week. So eating 6 days a week @1000 calories let's me have a refeed day of 1600-2000 calories. However, I always try and make sure I'm eating quality calories and look at macros constantly.   I think people worry that if you eat under 1000 consistently you'll develop an eating disorder. While that is possible, you know your body more than anyone and I would just replenish yourself with a refeed day and focus on quality and well-balanced macros.

If you're stagnating, just keep trying, and stay there if you need to. Gains are generally made on surplus diets, not deficits. You're trying to maintain lean muscle--you can't really build it at the moment.  Meanwhile, like /u/toekneewitt said, get plenty of protein, and you can always try eating more calories on a lifting day and less calories on a non-lifting day, and go for a weekly average intake of 1200 vs a daily one."

I'm trying to lose some extra fat so I've been cutting out all starches and limiting my sugar intake. Do you track your macros? I set MFP to 1000 calories with a goal of about 100g of protein intake. It forces me to make a majority of my daily 1200 calories protein. I ask for your weight because your body can only absorb so much protein.   I work out at 5am, protein shake after (50g of protein for 180 calories), lunch after 12pm (20-30g of protein and veggies), dinner around 6pm (same macros as lunch), and a Quest bar in between if one of my meals was vegetarian. I intermittent fast and only eat between 12-8pm (except for my post-workout protein shake).   This method so far has helped me stick to my calorie limit without my lifts suffering.

1200isplenty,3chrnq,ChimeraThree,7,Wed Jul 8 00:30:15 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're not bingeing because of low nutrition throughout the day? Are you pre planning your meals or picking and choosing when you are hungry? Those two questions really helped me change my thinking.   I usually don't eat breakfast but in trying to get an adequate amount of protein throughout the day, I have to. Breakfast keeps me full until 3 pm, when I can eat a light lunch. My dinner is pre planned and is usually healthful. It's already logged so I can't really deviate (unless I need to).   Before I would not eat breakfast, eat a light lunch and then fall apart at dinner shoving as much into my face as possible. Which is not the worst if you're sticking to your calories but made me feel like utter shit.  Then all the other free calories are open to whatever I want, so long as I have gotten my protein in. If I haven't eaten the proper amount of protein, I will pick snacks that lead to that: eggs, edamame, peanut butter, Greek yogurt etc.  But really, if you like treats go for it as long as you are meeting all your other nutritional requirements.  I've noticed an improvement in my mental health since eating less junky foods and more nutritious foods. And if eating that delicious salad makes me happy and fills me up leaving 100 calories floating in the ether, then I'm sure I will make good use of it on a night out :D"
1200isplenty,3chrnq,craaackle,3,Wed Jul 8 01:55:23 2015 UTC,"This.    Restricting yourself to 1000 calories in order to cut out the chips seems like a rather odd approach.  If I eat 1000 calories and happen to be comfortable, and don't want anything else, I don't generally eat those extra 200, but I wouldn't make a goal out of the 1000.  I'd recommend just trying to limit the junk food in the house first (or at least put it out of sight if there are others who like it--that works too).    Also, it sounds like maybe your calorie dispersal throughout the day could use some work, if you're getting ravenous at noon and 2.  I'm normally not hungry when I first wake (5:30), but if I don't eat around 9 or so (when I'm moderately starting to desire something), I'll get hungry for lunch earlier than normal, which throws off my day.  I started bringing a small breakfast (yogurt) to eat at that time, and then I'm not ravenous at lunch.  That allows for a smaller lunch, and then I still have calories for a small snack in the afternoon plus my largest meal at dinner.  It all came down to listening to the cues from my body and planning around them.    Dinners are where things can go crazy for me as well, so I try to plan those in advance if possible.  Even if I don't have a full week planned out, I'll try to come up with the dinner idea  after I finish my lunch.  That way I'm not too hungry, and I can make better decisions.  Otherwise, when I get home and the couch tries to eat me for the night, it's harder to come up with something beyond convenience foods.  I don't generally have an after dinner snack other than my gummy multi-vitamins.  Knowing that I don't need to plan for that, I can split the rest of my calories more effectively throughout the day."

I tried drinking lots of water before and after my meals. I increased my fats and proteins which are really important for mental health and maintain muscle mass while you are missing weight and I have adequate healthy carbs. It seems like no one understand my problem, its rather impulsive and shameful. I once ate a whole costco pie to my self including the whip cream. So I have had to work with a psychiatrist through mine. Its helped, I still have moments of weakness but they don't last as long or happen as often.

I don't really eat legumes, and tend to stick to mostly carbs and vegetables. So the real problem must be protein intake. I'm assuming that's also what is making losing weight more difficult.  Thanks for your help - the meal spacing is working out well for me. This is how I've always eaten, but maybe bulking out my snacks and eating more protein overall will help to curb the issue."

All things I know way too well. (I put on roughly 15lbs during the final two quarters of my college life.)  Since switching to 1200, here's what I have discovered:   Eat Breakfast! Start simple, and build up. Maybe an orange, a handful of berries. Try a week with yogurt, with granola, and maybe some eggs and toast! It's a fantastic way to get your day going, and will keep you from being famished by lunch.  Prep grab and go snacks. I actually write the calorie count ON the bags. I always keep fruit veggies, chopped and ready, in a tupperware dish in my fridge. That way when I get the urge to snack, I have no excuses NOT to be healthy. (Worried about calories? Dip them in some hummus! Great source of protein. My favorite is garlic.) Still want chips? Check out what a serving actually is, pull it out, and put the bag away! Works great for me. And instead of eating the chip in one bite, I break them into smaller pieces. I feel like I am eating more, and more slowly - like SNACKING!  Really focus on splitting calories up throughout the day. If you wait until the end of the day to eat nearly your daily allowance, your body is going to go into starvation mode. Instead of burning fat and calories, it will try to store everything because it believes it won't get nutrients for another 24 hours!   Hope that helps!"

You can go to 1000 calories if you are meeting your macros. Make sure you're getting 100-130 grams of protein and half your body weight in fat. If you can do that at only 1000 calories then eat 1000 calories. If you can't meet at least those two things on that amount of calories then you need to eat more and do more cardio.

I drink only Jack and Diet Coke (no need to add calories from the chaser) I almost always go over my calorie limit, but considering I'm at a 1000 calorie deficient I try to only go over by 500 or less so I'm still at a decent deficient. the best tip I can give you is to track everything you drink.

I think that was the hardest thing to stop doing, it was kind of how my bf and I unwound after a day. Now we tend to drink only on weekends. A lot of times, the days we drink on are the same as the days we have a heavy workout early in the day. I end up changing very little about my diet for that day and then use the extra calories I earned from working out to drink. Most days I don't eat or drink back those calories, but about once or twice a week I do. Maybe when you have plans to go out go to the gym earlier in the day, or convince your friends to go for a hike, and then you guys hit the bar after."

I used to eat much more, probably 2500 a day and I used to do a lot of heavy weight lifting etc. By some miracle I had only put on a small amount of weight. I chose to start 1200 because I got injured and can only do light workouts. I'm really enjoying it now :) I notice that my stomach is a little flatter and I've lost 1kg. Which to me is an achievement I've never reached :)"
1200isplenty,3ce0w8,thatgirljane,2,Tue Jul 7 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"I started eating 1200 calories 46 days ago. I was hiking about 5 times a week until it got too hot, so now I go to the gym instead for some cardio. At first I would eat back about half the calories I burned, but now I'm trying to stick to around 1200 even on days I work out.   As of today I have lost 9 lbs. My starting weight was 145 lbs, I'm now 136 lbs, and my first goal is 125 lbs. From there I will see how I look/feel and decide if I want to go down to 120.   Right now my exercise regimen is primarily cardio, at least 20 min/day (usually with 1 day off a week). Before it got really hot out I was hiking with my dog for 30-60 min a day during the week and then longer on weekends. I can't wait for it to cool down so I can go back to hiking, I hate going to the gym, and would much rather get my exercise outside.  As far as motivation goes for working out, before it got hot out it was easy to remember to get out for exercise daily because my dog needed it too. Now it's just that I don't want to lose any progress, I'm trying to improve my lung functionality (I have asthma that I used to have under decent control, then I stopped exercising), and eating 1200 calories with out exercise will be very slow progress for me.  I think the hardest part for me so far has been cutting back on drinking. I used to have 1 drink almost every night and it's just a massive dump of empty calories. I've cut back and try to limit my drinking to once a week, although sometimes I cheat. As far as the actual diet, I have no issues. I actually fill fuller now because I'm eating better foods and I'm cooking almost all my meals.  Ooph, sorry that was probably a lot more than you were expecting, I'm just really excited that I'm so close to having lost 10 lbs (I'll have it by next week!). Anyways, I wish you luck on your weight loss journey, and I hope this was at least a little helpful!"

1200isplenty,3ce0w8,halleyscomet1214,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:17:47 2015 UTC,I started eating 1200cals back in March. Because I realized that although I eat healthy foods and lots of veggies and good stuff I had ZERO idea of portion control so I had a very good habit of over eating good things.  Since March I've lost 8 lbs which I never thought would happen. I work out (run/circuits/yoga) atleast 3 times a week but am always active more days since my SO and I hike and bike and what not over the weekends. It's been a slow journey but I keep surprising myself that the weight is just falling off since the only thing I've changed about my diet/lifestyle is just being more conscious of the amount of shit I put in my body.   I definitely still drink alcohol and indulge all of the times but now I'm just more conscious of it. I just love how I'm losing weight and feel at the end of the day like I'm not trying (since most other diets I've done have crashed and burned and left me starving!)

I'm usually a fairly healthy eater, but now that I'm just eating 1200 calories a day, I feel like I'm nitpicking everything I'm eating, which is a dramatic change for me. So it kind of bums me out when I haven't lost 20 pounds in a week. That's an exaggeration but you get the idea. Thanks for sharing your story!

I also had a lot of canned vegetarian chili and soup from Trader Joe's, that would work if you have a fridge (for the container once opened) and microwave.  Greek yogurt, fruit, hummus with veggies and whole grain chips, and salads would be great options if you just have a fridge.  I didn't really restrict my eating while recovering, though.  I knew I needed food to heal, especially protein.  I didn't know how many extra calories are needed for healing, so I just ate when I was hungry (which was probably more than necessary because I was just lying around a lot), choosing really healthy foods even more than usual.  Didn't gain a pound, so I guess it worked out!"
1200isplenty,3cdxmi,um00actually,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:17:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, depending on what kind of surgery you're having and the medications you're taking, you may have trouble eating enough calories per day. I had surgery in late May and for the first week I was too nauseous and sleepy to do much but eat microwavable soups. You are going to spend a lot longer than three weeks recovering because you will likely have a serious nutrient deficit once you start cooking again, especially given your limitations. That being said, here are some ideas from my experience.  Since you are talking about storing food on the shelf or in a mini fridge, I am assuming you don't have a microwave? If you have access to some other way of boiling water, then get ahold of some oatmeal and peanut butter. This is easy on your stomach and will give you something for breakfast every day as well as something to eat when you feel nauseous. I would prepare some mild foods ahead of time that can be eaten cold, will store for the 3-4 days or maybe the first week in the mini fridge, and portion them out in tupperware containers. Egg scrambles/quiches, mashed potatoes/cauliflower with veggies, etc. Just keep in mind these will probably keep 5 days max unless your mini fridge is seriously powerful, but the initial variety will keep you from going crazy.  Tortillas will only keep about a week in your minifridge, but if you can get someone to bring you more (and specify they get low calorie kind), deli meat will last ~2 weeks unopened, so you could buy two packages and save one for your second week. Spinach, if stored properly, could last all 3 weeks. With those 3 things, you have the pretty decent makings of a sandwich wrap.   Something I made today that required no cooking whatsoever (if you have access to a blender): Puree a can of cannellini beans and a clove of garlic in a blender, spread on a tortilla, layer with spinach. I also sprinkled goat cheese on top before rolling and dipped in red pepper hummus, but those will not last 3 weeks in a fridge. One wrap (with goat cheese) is ~250 calories, so you have some wiggle room to add something artificial for flavor if necessary --dry grated parmesan perhaps? The bean spread will last a few days, and you can just crack open a new can to make more if you run out or it starts to go bad.  I would also experiments with salads like this which can be prepared entirely with canned food and eaten cold if necessary. Omit fresh vegetables and season this a bit, and you have something palatable that will break up the crackers. Or, hell, you can eat the salad with the crackers if you're feeling dangerous."
1200isplenty,3cdxmi,almostwinter,0,Tue Jul 7 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"Cut up veggies, including carrots, celery, peppers of all colors, snap peas, green beans, broccoli, cherry tomatoes (leave uncut like grapes), and cucumber or anything else you like raw. If you want a dip use some greek yogurt with spices. You can buy plain greek yogurt and mix in different spices depending on your mood and how much you'll eat at a time. You can do the same with fruits and add honey to the yogurt for things like apples, grapes, pears, plums, pineapple, banana, peaches, cherries, etc. Make yourself a large bag of mixed nuts to snack on, or better yet make yourself individual serving bags of mixed nuts. If you can get an electric tea kettle you can do instant things like oatmeal, rice, and beans. If you have a microwave you can easily make potatoes/sweet potatoes with a wet paper towel. Do some searching on /r/eatcheapandhealthy, /r/fitmeals, or even /r/sundaymealprep for people who are in college dorms, you'll be able to get a lot of ideas from that because they usually have a limited amount of space and tools available to them like yourself."

I see someone below saying the ones sold in Canada are sweetened with a different sweetner so maybe that's part of it. They definitely tasted more like a healthy protein bar than some kind of amazing chocolate bar. I mean, not horrible tasting but rather chemical and nothing like a real brownie, or muffin, or cookie, or whatever. I find when people say, ""tastes better than a candy bar, I'm so satisified, I could only eat half and that was AMAZING"" or whatever it sounds a bit humble braggy... but maybe that's just me. A lot of posts in this subreddit can sound a bit humble braggy to me though at times so I just don't read here when I'm in a certain mood haha. Anyways.. don't love quest bars and don't see the point in spending my money on them/using up calories on them when I just buy protein powder and blend it up with some fruit and get a similar amount of protein without the chemical taste. But it's obviously personal preference. Tastewise I far prefer LaraBar but the macros of a LaraBar doesn't even compare to quest in terms of protein, sugar etc because the LaraBars are made with dates and actually have a fair amount of sugar."

Anything made with something other than sugar I think is going to have some kind of artificial sweetener taste but it's just something you deal with when every calorie matters so much (I'm 5'1 female so not a whole lot of room for extra calories). And see for me protein powders aren't really my thing, I don't own a blender and they always leave me feeling bloated and the good ones with less sugar have the same aftertaste. To each their own."

I do find the whole subreddit can be a touch humble braggy sometimes, not really directed at you so sorry I chose to comment on your thread but just in general.. it's just the constant comments like I was sooooooo stuffed by this 250 calorie dinner, it was sooooooooo amazing, it tasted exactly like decadent peanut butter frosting, I am SOOOOO full, etc.. I understand it's the nature of doing a 1200 calorie diet that most of us are restricting our calories/food choices somewhat so we are more inclined to sort of think something tastes amazing or is very satisfying if it has lots of veggies or whatever, and it totally is possible to be stuffed if a meal is high volume/low calorie, but I just find it all a bit hyperbolic sometimes. Sometimes it can come off a bit ""oh look at me, I'm soooo stuffed by this small meal.. aren't I good dieter?"" I'm probably gonna get some flack for this comment but whatever. I come and go from this sub because it's useful but sometimes it gets to me, I have a history of disordered eating so it's more on me than anyone esle. The humble brag thing is not all in my head but it's a sign for me to take a break from the sub generally because I notice it more when I'm in a certain sort of hate my diet kinda mood, so it's as much a reflection of me as anyone else."

It's like coming here and being accountable...that's kind of how I look at it. Sucks you have the back and forth with dieting. I think we all struggle with that. How I combat that is I'll have a ""refeed"" (read:cheat) day where I eat 1600-2k calories. So while I'm eating all this diet food, I get to be planning my next cheat day."

The refeed day sounds interesting, I'll definitely look into that a bit more. I have gone up to maintenance calories (so like 1800ish) a few times for special occasions and cheat meals out and what not so more or less the same thing but now that I've lost a good amount, my overall weight loss gets slower and slower (since I have less to lose.. and since I burn less calories now that I'm not so big) so it ends up seeming more imperative to stick to 1200 cals.

I also like making chicken thighs in bulk. I'm doing more calories than you guys because I'm a cyclist, but I'd say one thigh would be the perfect amount to tote around in a Tupperware container with all your tastey veggies!  My recipe is to lightly grease a pan that has a lip to it so that the juices don't runeth over and preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Lay the thighs in the pan smooth part facing up so that they aren't touching. Season liberally to your hearts desire. My base seasoning recipe is an even, light sprinkling of salt over every thigh, and then liberal amounts of garlic powder, pepper, and smoked paprika, and then maybe some italian seasoning depending on my mood. Cook the thighs for 30 minutes, and then turn the heat down to 350. Depending on your oven size they will be done in 15-30minutes. I usually check on them every ten minutes during this part. Your thighs will keep for 2 weeks in the fridge, but mine are usually gone within the week.  I like to eat these thighs for lunch every day when I'm in school. Sometimes I'll have them for dinner too, or make a few of them into a chicken salad kind of deal. This recipe has never failed me, and I hope it doesn't fail you either!"

If you want the fat to drain right off you can suspend them a little, like put them on one of these while they cook. Most of the fat will render off and you'll have crispy skin. Let cool and then shred by hand.   Thighs are probably the fattiest part of the chicken, so you'll always end up with relatively little meat per thigh."

1200isplenty,3c2zqu,littledazed,12,Sat Jul 4 07:17:04 2015 UTC,"Greek Yogurt - I eat this mixed with PB2, thawed frozen berries, and honey; mixed with protein powder; as a replacement for sour cream on sweet potatoes Hot Sauce - I generally switch between Cholula and Sriracha, depending on what I'm eating it with. Frozen Veggies - My two staples are a Peppers and Onions Mix and California Blend, which contains broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. I put these in everything - omelettes, zoodle (zucchini noodle) dishes, curries, stir fries, etc. Eggs and Egg Whites - I make eggs with, usually, one whole egg and the rest egg whites and frozen veggies. I top with hot sauce and, occasionally, cheese. If I top with something like avocado, I'll skip the whole egg and just use egg whites. Bananas - I work frozen 'banana ice cream' into my calorie budget probably 4 days out of the week. You can dress this up in a bunch of ways to make it like a sundae: mixed with cocoa powder and/or Chocolate PB2; mixed with Pumpkin Pie Spice and topped with a Sugar Free Caramel Sauce; Mixed with cocoa powder and blended with frozen berries; topped with Lite Kool Whip and Sugar Free Chocolate Sauce. Obviously, not the healthiest choice, but better than those (IMO) crappy 'Skinny Cow' ice creams and filling to boot! Zucchini - Great for zoodles or just chopped up in an omelette. Laughing Cow Cheese Wedges - I will cook up some california blend veggies with a pepper and onion mix, add a protein (low fat meat like chicken, a meat substitute, or tofu), and then mix these in at the end for a creamy, filling veg-heavy dish. I like to top it with green onion/scallions. Snacks - I like protein-heavy snacks, so I favor Lite String Cheese (Trader Joes ones are delicious and only 60 cals/stick) and Quest Bars.  Shredded Mozzarella - This is my go-to cheese right now. I make flatbread pizza with it about once a week, topped with jarred pizza sauce (because recording cals while I cook kind of saps my will to make my own sauce), chopped up peppers and onions (I use this in everything!), frozen meatballs (again, chopped), fresh basil (I grow this), and a mix of rosemary and oregano - sometimes thyme. Cauliflower - If I'm not buying it frozen, it's because I'm using it as a replacement for rice! There's an amazing 'fried rice recipe that I got from this sub that I frequently make a variation of'. You can mix the soy sauce and sweet chili sauce with PB2, for example, to make a lazy peanut sauce. Mmmm. Chicken Breast - I will pick some of these up and grill / smoke them in my Big Green Egg, then slice them up to throw into dishes pre-cooked. Tofu - What can I say? I like tofu. Use anywhere you'd use meat, though I mainly eat it as scrambled tofu, in stir fries, or in curries. Boca Burgers and Morningstar Patties - I rarely eat these in their original state. I usually crumble them up to put in something else. EVOL Burritos - We eat way too many of these, covered in Cholula. They are easy, low cal for a full meal, and delicious, so whatever. :D I think my SO would die a little inside if we stopped buying these. Sun-dried tomatoes, not in oil - Wonderful on top of flatbread pizza, in omelettes, in zoodle or pasta dishes. Just so much flavor. Dreamfields Low-Carb Pasta - Sometimes you just want pasta and have a ton of cals left over at the end of the day. I always mix in a lot of frozen veggies and, if I'm feeling super decadent, a Lite Alfredo Sauce and some frozen meatballs. Regular Marinara Sauce is also good here. Dried Shiitake Mushrooms - Soooo affordable when you buy in bulk online.. I put these in most of my asian-y dishes.  FUN veggies - See something a little different and unique at the store? Pick it up! I have tried purple sweet potatoes, which were gorgeous and fun to eat, and the multi-colored carrots at trader joes, which I like to julienne with zucchini and use as a base for the same sauce in the cauliflower fried rice recipe (sweet chili sauce + soy sauce + red pepper flakes + optional pb2).   So, yea... that's the stuff I just about always have in stock. I hope this list gives you some good ideas! I've been kind of meaning to make an effort-post like this to hopefully give back to a sub I love so much. :)"

Most cauliflower crusts call for you to wring out the moisture with a cheese cloth. This is a super important step in making that ""dough"" a little crispier, and making it stick together. Cauliflower has a TON of water.   I suggest getting a cheese cloth and trying it. You can usually find them online for <$5. Or you can use a tea towel, something like that. In the process of steps, you'd do it after you let it cool from the microwave. Take your cauliflower chunks and put them in the cheese cloth and wring them out, then make it as directed. It should come out crispy and more like this crust looks. Nice and thin and crispy!   If you prefer it the way you originally did it and want it crispier, I would say a couple minutes (carefully monitored) in the broiler before you put the toppings on could give it a nice head start."

1200isplenty,3by31d,Top4You,3,Fri Jul 3 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"I just made this for the first time yesterday. Twice baked potatoes are one of my favorite potato dishes so I was pumped it tasted so good even when I swapped out basically every ingredient for something healthier.  Spray the outside of a medium Russet potato w/ canola oil. Put in oven at 400 degrees for an hour. Meanwhile, chop up a bunch of white onion (like 1/4 cup) and a bunch of green onion (like 3-4 stalks worth). Put the onion in a bowl, add about 3 tablespoons greek yogurt and a splash of (like 2 tablespoons) of non-fat milk. Add as much garlic as you like. I buy the pre-minced garlic and added a good sized spoonful. Mix that all up.  Once your potato is done, cut it in half the long way. Make sure it is actually done. If not, throw it back in for a bit. Then scoop out the insides, not all the way up to the edges though. Leave a little bit stuck to the edges to help support your potato bowl. Put all the potato in your bowl and mix till is creamy-ish. Spoon it back into your potato bowls. Sprinkle on a little mozzarella cheese. Put back in the oven at 400 for 15 min.   I would consider this 2 servings because half a twice baked potato is a good amount! If you want, you can refrigerate the other half to eat within the next couple days (you actually can freeze it too). Just wait to add the cheese till you are going to cook it."

I live in South Korea, and have about 1/2 of the things you can get. What I found that helped quite a lot was just going with the flow of cuisine. What can I get a lot of? Cabbage, zuchinni, kale-like greens, huge mushrooms that are practically flavorless, rice, sweet potatoes, daikon radish, broccoli (but no caulliflower! so sad cause I want to try cauliflower rice and pizza crust). So what I do is just stir fry everything with water, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and a little bit of spice if I can find it (Korean spice paste is made almost entirely out of sugar so I avoid it). I can also get my hands on shiritake noodles and premade pasta sauce. That's super low calorie, but a coincidence cause I'm in Asia and that's where the 'no calorie' noodle came from. If in doubt, I buy premade sauces from other Asian countries that are imports to Korea but are still easy to find (like oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce, etc).  So I'll eat stir fried vegetables and pan-fried chicken most days. I can get eggs for seriously cheap so I eat egg salad or egg omelettes with veggies. No cheese, dairy is expensive and cheese here tastes like cardboard hahaha. Salads made of cabbage and peppers and tomatoes and such for lunch. Make my own dressing (had to invest in the ingredients like olive oil and red wine vinegar, but they'll last me til I leave probably). I can get fruit at specific times for a short window so I buy it, savor it, and freeze the rest. I use that for oatmeal (I gotta pay out the nose for it, but I really like oatmeal).  All the other cuts of meat are really fatty, as that's how Koreans prefer their meat, so I stick to chicken and eggs, frozen dumplings sometimes if I can find them at a low calorie range.  You just gotta go with the flow. How do Argentinians eat their vegetables? What spices do they use there? You have to live like a local to eat healthily and cheaply. Trying to recreate American classics (in Korea at least), is like an expensive hobby of its own.  Hope this helps at least a little. It really isn't easy on such a low calorie intake abroad. Don't even get me started on eating out and not knowing the calories in ANYTHING. But chin up - you can do it and if you just plan and prepare, you can make simple recipes like the ones other Argentinians might be making.  But please! Any recipe ideas to spice up my average stir fry would be great. The devil seems to be in the repetition for me. Easy to prep but oh so boring when I can go out and get a pastry ;)"
1200isplenty,3c0al9,ChimeraThree,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Seems like we're in the same boat :( Eating the same meals everyday gets boring and even disgusting. I envy the variety people in some other countries have!  I actually am a local - it's just complicated to eat cheaply and feel full with 1200 calories a day here, without eating the same damn things every day! I can eat healthily and cheaply but my calorie intake would be higher if I wanted to not feel constantly hungry during the day. I could go to organic markets hours away and get other veggies I can't get in my city but then I wouldn't be able to pay rent :( I don't have too much money to spend on food. I'm tired of eating the same things (usually lettuce or arugula salads, but now I might try stir-frys like you!) to stay under 1200. And I can't find recipes anywhere :("
1200isplenty,3c0al9,ChimeraThree,2,Mon Jul 6 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry! I wasn't sure if it was a year abroad that you were doing.  To be honest, having a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's isn't helping them feel fuller, it's helping them make more complicated dishes easier. Unfortunately, without access to stuff like that you just need to stick to what you can source. You don't have to eat fish or beef or what have you. You can do happily on chicken (change up the spices or how they're cooked). The foods you described that you can get a hold of are actually really great ones that you can make a bunch of things out of. Low fat cheese + broccoli + potatoes or yams sounds like a really nice cheesy casserole (search for potatoes dauphinoise or gratin or potatoes au gratin - these dishes are like the one above). Spinach, tomatoes, and low fat cheese make an exquisite omelette. You can add in some thinly sliced potatoes and more eggs and make it a thicker frittata style dish (especially if you have an oven you can throw the pan into). Squash can be used to make a mashed potato style dish (for variety as opposed to using potatoes all the time) and you can top that with a leek, onion, cabbage, milk sautee that would be delicious. You can make a fresh tomato sauce really quickly and top a portabello mushroom with it and some low fat cheese to make a 'pizza'. You can also use that tomato sauce with zucchini/squash noodles or yam noodles or put it in a dish with sauteed spinach (any kind of vegetables really) and crack an egg in it to make shakshuka.  Your biggest issue seems more that you can't source exotic spices. But most things dont really need the spice (you don't need north African/Israeli/Turkish spices for shakshuka - you don't need Italian spices for a frittata or French spices for a gratin.....they are just extras)  Unfortunately, I found that to get variety you need to add in the time. I just don't have it with the job I have so I use weekends to prep and eat a monotonous week. But I let myself go to a convenience store every now and then and skip my monotonous meal for something more appealing.   Also, finding a recipe name (like frittata, or broccoli cheese soup) and googling 'alternative to broccoli in broccoli cheese soup) gives great options. You might find a cauliflower version, or a sweet potato version. Then that gives you a recipe base but a different flavor profile each time.  Hope this helps.

I had to eat giant ants, beetles, all kinds of things. The best comparison for kelp noodles is that you're biting through slime that's like algea (well because, kelp) but then the middle has the texture of very, very, very slowly closing your teeth down on the carapace of a beetle, until its insides squish out in a torrent of goopy puss into your mouth.

The word ""shirataki"" means ""white waterfall"", describing the appearance of these noodles. Largely composed of water and glucomannan, a water-soluble dietary fiber, they are very low in carbohydrates and calories, and have little flavor of their own.  Shirataki noodles can be found both in dry and soft ""wet"" forms in Asian markets and some supermarkets. When purchased wet, they are packaged in liquid. They normally have a shelf life of up to one year. Some brands may require rinsing or par-boiling as the water they are packaged in has an odor that may be unpleasant to those not accustomed to it.  Alternatively, the noodles can be drained and dry roasted. This gets rid of the bitterness. It also makes the noodles have a more pasta-like consistency. Dry roasting is done by placing noodles in a non-stick skillet on high for a minute or until you hear a slight squeaking noise when moving them around. After that they are ready to be added to soup stock or have a sauce added to them.

I would maybe take a different test or get another opinion just to see, it's possible the test was just wrong. normally 175-180 would be a bit high for someone 5'5""..

More then men though for sure. Here's the link http://www.weighttraining.com/features/female-bodybuilders and they work Very hard putting on muscle for years AND eating the right foods, and those girls are on drugs also. I'm not sure if you can be THAT big boned. What kind of tests are you doing? If you're just stepping on a scale then they aren't accurate at all. You can go online and calculate your frame size by taking some measurements also. But according to some other charts even for large frame you should only weigh up to 150-155 (unless you were a body builder in the off season!) I used to think I had a large frame but turns out I am only medium but also I said that a lot when I was overweight and in denial about it. Turns out I honestly didn't have as much muscle as I thought I did but later in life I tried to gain muscle and could only manage gaining about 5lbs in a few months of heavy lifting. It's really difficult for a woman to gain muscle especially after the ""newbie"" phase. I am curious what test you used though and if you really want a more accurate answer look online for the best ones, or I would just forget about it for now and keep eating healthy and exercising and eventually you will notice when you lose weight how far you want to take it.. so maybe don't set a goal for now? Mini goals each month would be good. Anyway good luck to you hope I didn't make you upset but it's very common for people on the heavier side to think they have more muscle and bigger bone frame then they really do, I did it too!  edit: Also I just want to say if you DO have a good amount of muscle make sure you keep your protein intake high enough while you lose.. because you don't want to lose the muscle you have it will give your body a great shape that you will notice when you lose the fat"

Try using some salt instead of part or all of the butter, anywhere you would use butter. Another people think they like/want butter is just added moisture/creaminess.  You can get that from a lot of things that have around the same number of calories as butter, but are healthier (unsaturated ""good"" fats instead of the saturated ""bad"" fats that butter has).  Peanut butter (and almond butter and other nut butters), smashed avocado, olive oil (really any oil but coconut oil, which is saturated fat), fat-free or reduced-fat cottage cheese or ricotta, hummus, and Smart Balance are great picks. I've tried Smart Balance Light and Brummel & Brown, two healthy (that means trans-fat free) butter substitutes with half the calories.  I thought they tasted pretty much the same, and they didn't have much flavor.  But try one!  Maybe you'll be unimpressed, maybe you'll love it but only for certain things, maybe using that + salt will get you your butter fix. I haven't tried this, but... butter extract.  I've seen it used in breakfasts like oatmeal to get a pastry taste.  Allegedly, sugar and cinnamon oatmeal will taste more like a snickerdoodle with butter extract added, it just adds that ""cookie"" flavor.

1200isplenty,3bv4mf,WWHarleyRider,4,Thu Jul 2 12:07:15 2015 UTC,"Ok so here's my ballpark estimate.   Fair warning, I looked up the zen salad and it looks like the zen salad is actually served on a bed of rice! Check the menu when you get there.   If the salad has rice, I'd estimate that the sushi has the same amount of rice as the salad, so I'll ignore that.   The salad has what appears to be half of an avocado. The roll has about one slice per roll on top, so I'll say that's about half of an avocado as well. But, the roll also has a chunk of avocado inside which is another quarter of an avocado (based on the amount of avocado in plain avocado sushi), which brings my estimate for the roll to 1/4 of an avocado more than the salad. Roll +80 calories  Looking at the salad:  Baby greens are pretty much negligible but I'll say you have 1 cup. Salad +8 calories English cucumber: hard to see but based on the other ingredients I'll say half a cucumber. Salad +15 calories Mango: 1/2 mango. Salad +100 calories Portabello mushroom: looks like one mushroom grilled (so add extra for cooking oil). Salad +35 calories Cashews: 1/4 cup. Salad +160 calories Dressing: I'll use a peanut butter dressing as an estimation, at 1.5 tbsp dressing for the salad. Salad +75 calories Total for salad: ~393 calories (plus the ignored half avocado and rice)  Roll: Gobo: 1/2 cup. Roll +40 calories Carrot: 1/2 medium. Roll +13 calories Pickled daikon: at 1/2 slice per piece, 4 slices. Roll +10 calories Total for roll: ~133 calories (plus the ignored half avocado and rice)  Half of an avocado has 160 calories. 1 cup of six grain rice has 225 calories.   Final total for salad: 778 calories.  Final total for roll: 518 calories.  Final total for salad without rice: 553 calories.   If the salad is riceless they have similar calorie counts. But even if the salad has rice, it still fits into your calorie allowance!  Why is the salad so much more caloric than the roll? Besides the extra avocado, the roll is filled with vegetables with a low calorie content. The mango, cashews, and dressing are much more calorie dense."

At chipotle, I usually get the burrito bowl with sofritas or carnitas, rice and beans, guacamole, etc (all the tasty stuff). The bowl is so big I can eat half for one meal and save the rest. That cuts an approximately 800-900 calorie meal down to something manageable, and I don't have to skimp.

I just pulled up Subway's nutritional information and all the measurements listed are for a 6"" flatbread, so I halved it and individually added ingredients. Assuming just basic American cheese, and no veggies added in, that 3"" comes out to 270. Not a huge difference, but I think on 1200 those extra 60 calories could be a bummer. For other cheeses, add a few more calories.  EDIT: Now I look at it listed at 390 for the whole thing and I'm beaten by how they can have different calorie totals for the same ingredients.

I go to Subway once in a blue moon but I don't bother to get a salad there because I can get way better salads at other places/make a better one for way less at home.. and Subway salads are boring.. just lettuce and basic veggies like cucumber, tomato, olives, peppers, and then chicken, nothing that fun or unique to put on it. When I do go to Subway which is not very often I usually ""indulge"" in a 6-inch that's not too unreasonable in calories (like turkey or chicken) and then load it up with veggies and little or no sauce. I kind of don't see the point in getting a salad from Subway unless there's literally no where else to go.. Wendy's and McDonalds both make better salads actually in my opinion for 400-500 calories. The new McDonalds ones with kale and quinoa are actually reasonable in calories and very tasty (especially the harvest chicken one), and no, they don't have more calories than a Big Mac before anyone rushes in to point that out."

I would be fine for a few days then binge on the weirdest foods that were just lying around, I didn't even enjoy it, I just wanted to feel stuffed. I upped my calories to 1600 because I needed to get in the habit of logging everything for a week or two. This period wasn't specifically about losing weight, it was more to develop the habit of mindful eating and tracking. Then I lowered to 1500 for a week, then 1400 and now I'm eating at 1350 and it's been a lot easier than it used to be. I think that eventually I will decrease a bit more if I plateau but for now, this is a happy medium where I don't feel like I'm constantly on the verge of a huge binge. I definitely think that starting with a small deficit and slowly lowering my calories was the reason I am now able to stay on track!

You may need to up your calories by a couple hundred to make this happen, but I promise you it's worth it. Eat every two hours, roughly. Even if you aren't hungry, eat something small (like an apple or a few crackers with hummus). By not letting yourself get really hungry, you're less likely to binge. When you're only kinda hungry you're far more likely to put in effort to make something healthy than you are when you want it rightnow."

I am a little wary of going over the 1,200 calorie limit, but honestly, I think you're right.  At least for transitioning purposes (and like you said, sticking with it), I think I might just try to aim for 1,500 calories now.  Then maybe reduce it as I go?"
1200isplenty,3bt7j1,loseitbetty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"It depends on where you are starting at calorie wise. Estimate what you had been eating, and slowly lower it week by week. If you were at 2000 calories or so a day, try for 1800. Eat that for a week, staying strict on it. If you know you want to eat something calorie dense, eat less of it to stay in your calories. After a week, drop down to 1600 calories.   As for hitting the wall and binging, before you over eat take a few minutes. Really think about how this fits in with your goals. Maybe do this with a glass of water because dehydration is a bitch, and can make you cranky and ""hungry"". It will sound tough, but you have to tell yourself no. Yes, you want to eat the entire fridge. But if you do that you will for sure not progress the way you want to. So tell yourself no. If you are hungry, find something the appropriate size and calories to what you need. It is HARD but you need to not let food have a hold on you."

Gained pretty much everything back due to depression. But I'm coming back.   You definitely can reduce if you want to, but honestly, I think 1300-1500 is far more realistic for the majority of people. The weight just comes off a tiny, tiny bit slower, but it'll be easier to transition back into normal eating once you're done and it's easier to stick to 1500. I know for me on days I'm shooting for 1200, if I messed up, I'd often be like ""well the day is ruined"" and the rest of the day was just bad. If you have a little more wiggle room, it's easier to fit everything in, plus you actually get pretty much a full extra meal by adding 300 calories. You'll be full, without a doubt. It really is a great way, dare I say the best way, to avoid bingeing."

What I've done is instead of forcing myself to stick to 1200 calories on MFP I've ""allowed"" myself 1600. Just the visual of knowing I have more calories allows me to relax and not be so stressful about eating.   I've found that by allowing myself this possible wiggle room I still end up eating between 1100-1200 calories. It's just the mental side that I'm not killing myself over being under 1200. I'm just making myself aware of portion control and healthy eating habits.   It's been a lot easier to maintain proper eating habits when a little wiggle room is there (although I'll only take it on special occasions) it's a mental technique that has helped me a lot."

1200isplenty,3bsjma,im_a_good_noodle,2,Thu Jul 2 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"Calorie for calorie yes it's the same in the body, but there are different kinds of sugars; fructose, glucose, and sucrose which all do different things and get metabolized in different ways. You want more glucose because that's the primary source of energy for your muscles and brain, and less fructose because it is only metabolized in the liver and is more lipogenic, or fat-producing, than glucose. Coconut sugar has 70-79% sucrose and only 3-9% each of fructose and glucose and cane sugar is 50% fructose. When sucrose is consumed it separates into individual sugar units of glucose and fructose. Unlike glucose, fructose does not cause insulin to be released or stimulate production of leptin, a key hormone for regulating energy intake and expenditure. These factors mean it appears to behave more like fat in the body than like other carbohydrates such as glucose.  I know that not everyone here is trying to be super healthy and that I am more strict about certain things than other are. But I figured there might be some lurkers who would appreciate the find because while PB2 is talked about a good amount on the sub, alternatives for it are not.

Either Saturday or Sunday, I'll eat no more than 1500, So that's eating back 300 calories. But that's because I overestimate the calories that are on the menus when I eat out, if I eat out which is about twice a month.   Sounds a little complicated? but it has worked for me.

I figure it's smart to log the difference between calories burned during the exercise compared to calories I would've burned in that same time if I hadn't been exercising (whether that's sitting around or walking around the house, etc) so I rarely log the whole session.

First off, a friend of mine came over to take my mind off some stress I'd been having, and she brought me a small slice of vegan cheese cake from a restaurant. I ate the slice but then couldn't find that specific restaurant's cake anywhere in MyFitnessPal nor anywhere online.   I found a listing on MFP for ""Homemade Vegan Cheesecake"" which had the calories for one slice at something like 1,800 which I'm pretty sure was a typo and was meant to be for a whole pie, but it still played on my mind a bit...   Then, I had to bake a cake. While I didn't taste any of the ingredients, it just got my wheels turning.   Then I got some bad news about the rent going up in my apartment complex and I had to take stock of my career, compare rents in my city, consider my family planning time-line and contemplate moving...   Long story short I ate several servings of cashews covered in melted cheese, with table salt added... :(  Today is a new day, and while I know better than to over restrict myself the day after something like that, this is gonna be a ""count calories by the week, not by the day"" kind of week for me :P lol."

I had this moment where I wanted to push through all the stress and pain and still meet my goals. . . and then it just imploded.  it doesn't help that I live with my entire family, 8 people, and none of them have ""healthy"" eating habits.  I mean, I'm an adult and I can make my own choices.  But when you're PMSing, cramping, in a bad mood, and then someone puts pizza in front of you. . . well. . . I faltered.

There's no way that you can gain more weight than the actual weight of the food you ate.   Some of that weight is water, and some (if not most) of the rest your body will use for fuel. Depending on how much you weigh, and what your BMR is, you can probably just chalk yesterday up to a weight maintenance day rather than a weight loss day.   Take care of yourself. Eat healthily and don't punish yourself for it. Don't rush things. Be kind to your body and your body will be kind to you."

1200isplenty,3bp3pm,amelisha,2,Wed Jul 1 15:15:39 2015 UTC,I was feeling the same way a few days ago... Jumped on they scale and saw that I gained 8 pounds. I felt terrible and ate in excess (maybe 100-200 calories additional a day plus whatever I worked out...). It's okay. A day or two of this bad eating made me realize that it's not really satisfying me anyway so I stopped. I did some research and found that the weight gain was just water weight and I was more hungry because of hormones but also because you BMR increases. You are burning a little more.  Just don't let a bump in the road stop your ride.

That combined with the bloating from water retention makes me feel like an absolute walrus right before my period and it is the worst. The only thing that helps me is to drink as much water as I can and remind myself not to let one bad day turn into a bad week, because while a day of overeating isn't going to mean any real gain, getting stressed out about it and giving up for days on end certainly can."

You could also add a dash of salt and switch from 15g to 25g of gluten flour and remove 10g of the 20g alfredo mix.

Is this correct? Are all calories accounted for by these 3 categories?   Yup!   1g of carbs has around 4 calories, same for protein. 1g of fat has around 9 calories. Is this correct? Sounds like you'll be at 1200 cal if you eat 4 pounds of chicken breast and nothing else (disregarding the fact that don't only need protein in your life)   This is correct. The hard part comes in when we consider how a lot of the junk food we crave is mostly ""bad"" fats and sugary carbs. Carbs are debatably the least ""necessary"" macro.   you lose weight if you're eating at a calorie deficit, doesn't matter if it's all carbs or all fat or all protein. Is this so?   Yes. However, you still want to watch your macros when you diet and make sure you get a good amount of protein and healthy fats.   you want to up your protein intake if you want to develop muscle, or avoid being skinny-fat. Weight loss doesn't mean you only lose the fat on your body, your muscles might diminish as well.   Yup. There are online calculators that will estimate how many grams of protein you need a day. And if you're lifting or working out as well as cutting calories, you definitely need to up your protein.   your body uses and burns carbs, protein and fat differently, but you need all three. Correct? I know you need fat in order to assimilate vitamins and other micronutrients, I'm guessing carbs give you energy, and protein for muscle development. Is this correct? Is this all there is? It sounds like the macros should have a better role than my crass understanding :)   Correct. You can get really deep into macros and the science behind them, but overall, you've got it right.   Also - do we really need carbs?   Yes. Vegetables are carbs and you'd have an unhealthy diet if you didn't eat any vegetables. Now, how many carbs you need is subject to debate. Personally, as a non-keto dieter, I mostly worry about getting in my minimum of protein for the day.   Do keto diets still have carbs in them, or can you strive for 0 carbs and still be ok? (Assuming you can find food that has 0 carbs, that is)   There are 0 carb foods, but no, even on keto you don't need to 100% cut out carbs. I think they recommend staying below 40 g (or 20 g if you're hardcore), but please don't take my word for it. Research, research, research! /r/keto   what's the difference in having an intake of 50% carbs, 30% protein, 20% fat versus 50% protein, 30% carbs, 20% fat? (Or another percentage of fat, I'm interested in the difference between protein and carbs mostly). If you're still at deficit, you'll still lose weight, but more protein means less chances of getting skinny fat? Or? what would be a good macros breakdown for losing weight but not necessarily building muscle (yet)?   Start by figuring out how much protein you need. Then I would divide the remaining calories between carbs and fats evenly. Adjust your percentages as you go along until you reach something you're happy with.  50% protein is very difficult on a 1200 calorie diet. It pretty much guarantees you need to be on a protein-rich diet like eggs, chicken, turkey, and yogurt everyday, all day. Some people can do it, but if all you're trying to do is minimize muscle loss, then I think it's going a little overboard."

The bottom line is that weight loss is a calorie deficit. Eat less calories than you use in a day.  You could eat all those calories in chicken, white bread or chocolate cupcakes.  Doesn't matter.  Calories in, calories out.    Now, if you ate nothing but 1200 cals worth of chocolate cupcakes, you'd feel like shit.  That's why we talk about a balanced diet.  Cutting out one entire food group is not really needed or healthy.    I don't know what ""skinny fat"" means, so I can't really help you with that.  Think of it this way.  Hunger comes from 3 places.  Your stomach, your brain and your emotions.  Protein satisfies your brain hunger, fiber and volume of food satisfy your stomach hunger, and assorted other crap satisfies your emotional hunger.   So a balanced meal of a fat, protein and carbs that is high in fiber and has a lot of food on the plate will keep you happy and full.  If you're going for a calorie deficit, veggies are an amazing way to fill up your tummy for just a few calories."

As far as diet goes, I would suggest eating more protein, without knowing everything that you eat.   In terms of body composition, this is where exercise really comes in. Jogging is awesome, won't help you build muscle which is essentially what it boils down to you wanting to do. I'd suggest you start some form of lifting. Circuit training and standard lifting is popular. Personally I'm a big fan of body-weight fitness, which requires pretty much no equipment, largely lunges, squats, planks, burpees, that sort of stuff. I'd suggest you look into some lifting options and pick something that appeals to you!   Just as a note because this worked for me: When I became interested in bodyweight exercises, I paid a PT for 4 sessions, and she did up 4 workouts for me that I cycle through. So I didn't pay that much, and I have tons of stuff I can do, I know my form is good etc. It might be worth it to look into just a few sessions if you aren't familiar with whatever you decide to get into."

I started lifting and eating a lot more protein. In ~6 months, I had lost 12 pounds in total and had flex-able baby muscles to boot.  I think the main thing to realize is that things will take time, but it's okay. There's no rush, and a year's worth of work is a drop in the bucket compared to the vast expanse of life.  That being said, if you can get more protein and start lifting, that will 100% be the best thing for you. More muscle = more calories burnt, better health, increased strength, and eventually faster weight loss.   If you don't have access to a gym, look up HIIT workouts. Do sprints, circuits/plyometrics type workouts (jump squats, wall sits, jump lunges, planks, burpees). Even getting into some power yoga can help you as long as you're consistent."

If you're interested, I'd be happy to write up some recipes for you. Here is one of my favorites that is dead simple.  Broccoli, Lentil, and Coconut Curry  You will need: salt, turmeric, and red chili powder (these three make up the fundamental base of spices that are in basically every Indian dish) coconut powder/flakes, broccoli, yellow moong dal     Chop 2-3 stalks broccoli into ½ in. chunks. Place into a large bowl, add a few splashes of water, cover, and microwave for 2-3 minutes to par-cook. While broccoli is in microwave, bring a pot of water to boil. Place ¼ cup moong lentils into boiling water and let cook 8-10 minutes or until soft. Heat a large pan over medium flame and drizzle in a bit of oil (I use olive oil). When oil is hot, spread par-cooked broccoli evenly in pan. Do not pour in water. Add 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon turmeric, and red chili powder to taste. Stir. Reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and cook until broccoli is fork-tender. When lentils are finished cooking, strain out water and reserve lentils in a bowl.  When broccoli is fork-tender, add in lentils and stir. Increase heat to medium and cook uncovered for 2 minutes.  Add 1-2 tablespoons grated coconut and add salt to taste. Stir and cook over high for 1 to 2 minutes.   It's a super simple recipe -- it's basically just broccoli, lentils, and a little bit of coconut -- and so quite low-calorie but it tastes absolutely amazing."

I tend to season it like a steak--rub in the spices of choice a few minutes before hand and then let it sit. I also cook it similarly to a steak, but with medium-high heat instead of high. But like a steak, don't flip it over a whole bunch--I've found it's best if you only flip it once, usually about 3 minutes on each side. Depends on how thick it is. Also, if you like a thick cut, you can put on a lid while cooking it help it cook all the way through."

I'm still trying to figure it out myself, but I'm a lot better at making smart choices than I was when I started. Low calorie ready meals are a good option, I used to eat them a lot when I first started calorie counting because you know exactly how many calories are in them, and you don't need to worry about portion sizes. All UK supermarkets have their own ""healthy"" ranges; count on us, light choices, good for you... the list goes on! They're a great place to start.  I'm now trying to cut out processed foods as it gives me a bit more control over what I eat and the ingredients that I use. Now that it's summer I've started to eat a lot more salad and meat. So instead of coming in from a busy day at work and putting a ready meal in the microwave, I will come home, chop some salad, boil a couple of eggs and open a tin of tuna, it takes less than 10 minutes and is a lot better for me.   I have a lot of love for the Boots meal deals, and will usually go there for lunch if I'm out and about. They do a main, a snack and a drink for £3.29, and they have loads of healthy options. At the moment I am in love with their sushi! It's like 250 calories and really filling, if you team that with a pot of fruit at ~50 calories and a bottle of water or a diet coke you've got a filling lunch for ~300 calories. I also always carry fruit in my handbag for emergencies!  This is what works for me, it's taken a while to get here, so don't beat yourself up if you make a bad choice!

Stirred it continuously for about 10 minutes and added a little bit of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder just in case, but you can season however you like and continue adjusting. That's all! :)"

Once in a while I will have a nice little breakfast of eggs/bacon/hashbrowns but this is fairly rare.   Lunch- usually a salad with a piece of fruit, never anything heavy and I am prone to skipping this meal as well.   Dinner- Always, always my heaviest meal because towards nighttime is when I tend to get the most hungry. Meal will consist of a standard meat/vegetable/healthy fat combo. This meal will usually be 1/2-2/3 of my calories for the day.   Day typically ends with a snack before bed, I hate going to bed hungry.   Generally speaking I eat the bulk of my calories towards the evening.

I have dessert late at night so i am not hungry when i sleep, greek yoghurt is a good source of slow release protein overnight too. Once i hit my ptotein allowance for dinner, the rest of the days calories are made up with vegges and/or carbs.  I suppliment this diet with metamucil, a multi vitamin, fish oil and vitamin D.

This is the biggest one for me because the way I was raised was never waste food, but you know what, eat for yourself and not for others. If someone says something like ""oh you're not eating very much"" I say ""thank you, I'm full."" if they keep pressing just say ""thanks for your concern"". Try all the new foods but try it sample size! Don't serve yourself meal portions of something new or something you like. If you like it, maybe you can go back for some more but enjoy what's on your plate here and now.

Turn out onto a floured surface and knead for approx 5 mins. Leave to rise for approx 1 hour, covered by a damp tea towel. Put all the sauce ingredients in a saucepan or frying pan and simmer over a low heat for 20-30 minutes to reduce and thicken. Taste the sauce periodically and consider adding 3/4 teaspoon of brown sugar if the tomatoes taste too acidic. Put your beef, onion, garlic, cumin and coriander in a frying pan on a medium heat for about 5 or 6 minutes, until the onion is softening and the beef has browned a little. Add a little more salt and pepper if required. After your dough has roughly doubled in size, knock it back and divide it into 4 equal chunks (by weight). Roll these out into your bases. Spread a little tomato sauce on each base and then layer on some mozzarella, followed by your toppings. Cook on 200C (390F) for about 6 minutes.   Hope that helps!"

I also take a bag of broccoli slaw, add Walden's 0 cal coleslaw dressing, some lime juice, and dice up some pear and throw it in.

1200isplenty,3b15x9,Southern_Oak,5,Sat Jun 27 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"This takes a while to prepare, but SO worth it.   Roasted Veggie Burrito  1) Take as many vegetables as you want and chop them up. The ones I usually opt for are cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, squash, carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, etc. You can add what you want, but make sure you include a ""solid"" veggie that won't be too soft when it cooks. For example, cooked cauliflower has substance when cooked, but if you had only squash and zucchini, they become really soft.   2) Add some seasoning. There is no exact recipe for this, it all depends on how spicy you like your food. I add cumin, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and bit of lemon juice. Along with this, add a drizzle of olive oil. I usually go for a tbsp.  3) Line a small pan with aluminum foil and place your veggies on it so they make a nice single layer. This step is important! If you have too many veggies or not a big enough pan, they will stay soft and the ""crisp"" won't follow through. Make sure all the veggies are touching the pan.  4) Bake at 350 degrees for about an hour. Test for doneness by eating a potato piece. When that's cooked, the rest should be cooked as well. (Make sure your potato pieces are small). I like mine really roasted and take it out of the oven when the broccoli is slightly charred.  5) Grab your favorite low cal wrap and spread a layer of hummus, load up with your veggies, add sriracha, ketchup, a bit of ranch, some jalapenos, maybe sour cream, and some fresh lettuce.  6) Roll that baby up and toast on a fry pan with a smidge of oil.  SO GOOD.   *To speed up the process, I bought a ton of veggies one day and cut them up and put them in gallon ziplock bags in the freezer. As far as actual cooking time, if I'm planning on eating it more than once during the week, I roast the veggies ahead of time and put them in the fridge. They last about a week, but you have to ""crisp"" them up by putting them in the oven for about 5 min at 350 degrees."

This isn't rice, but it's great to have alongside chili and curries (or, I imagine, other meals with some liquid).

Fruit/veggies that are simple and don't require additional prep (ie. can be eaten whole and raw) and don't go bad right away like apples or pears, baby carrots, bananas. Simple stuff like string cheese, maybe a few yogurt cups, or cottage cheese, anything like that could go in the mini fridge and make a breakfast or lunch in a pinch with some fruit.. maybe some nuts for snacking such as almonds or cashews. Even a small town grocery store should have basic stuff like apples and yogurt.. just because it's a smaller town doesn't mean they have no normal food in their grocery store! I think you might be overthinking this a tad.. people in smaller towns have to eat healthy too. I agree though that almond butter packs and quest bars and nuts all sound good.. I would try to supplement with a few fruits/veg from the store (just go the first day and get enough for the three days) and you should be fine. Cottage cheese with some fruit is quite good for a ligher lunch!  As for the diner.. I agree with the person who said poached eggs as an option. Generally I would avoid anything that seems really carby and/or fried or greasy. Pancakes, sandwiches with a ton of bread, pasta, rice.. anything that comes with a huge portion of carbs will be high-calorie. Look more for protein items with veggies as your side. Like fish or chicken (assuming it's not deep fried). Sometimes asking for a burger patty with no bun can be surprisingly reasonable in calories! Ask for lettuce and then wrap the lettuce around the patty as your bun. Soups can be reasonable assuming they're not ""cream"" or ""chowder."" Salads can be okay but you want to watch for the type of dressing (ask for it on the side if possible) and the amount of high-cal toppings (croutons, cheese, bacon, etc.. as most of us known some salads can be more calorific than a burger with all the toppings restaurants put on them! You might be surprised though, a lot of diners these days (even ones in small towns) are doing a healthier option or low-carb plate or whatever. One of the last diners near me had a ""lite"" breakfast which was plain poached eggs, whole wheat english muffin (no added butter) and plain fruit. It was like 400-ish calories and very satisfying. Obviously not every diner will have healthy options but just saying you might be surprised."

You know the ones that say, ""a serving of cheese is as big as your thumb, a serving of protein is the size of your palm without the fingers, etc."" so you know how much of your food to eat at the restaurant.  A few weeks ago I ended up in a diner with my daughter, so I plugged in a reasonable portion of what I was thinking of getting into MFP and it wasn't too bad. I ordered green beans and lima beans as my sides, and gave my corn muffin to my daughter. I ate about half of everything because the portions were huge, and had a light dinner. If they have soup, you could get one with a clear broth for one of your meals. Doing something like that for three days won't be TOO bad, I wouldn't think."

It's a great way to track calories and macros. Finally you can track your progress in weight and other measurements, and easily set calorie and exercise goals.

I boil a large head of cauliflower for about 10 minutes then throw it in a blender with 3-4 ounces cream cheese (can be the low fat stuff), salt, pepper, minced garlic, and a couple tbsp of butter. Purée until smooth and then I add it to a pot of cut up red potatoes and carrots that I've cooked until soft. Then I just let it cook for a couple minutes to all meld together. Different spices and veggies can be added for different tastes as well as milk, chicken broth, or a can of northern beans (blended in until smooth) to change the thickness.  I served this to my mom and told her it was potato soup. She had no idea it was made with cauliflower.  I haven't made it in a while, so I don't know the calorie count off the top of my head and it ultimately depends on what you put in it, but the use of cauliflower instead of potato definitely cut down on the calories and carbs since 100g cauliflower is about 25 calories versus 100g of potato is closer to 100 calories."

Then I boiled them for two minutes and put them back in the strainer and washed them again. And then I stir-fried them with the rest of the ingredients. I read that the bad taste is mostly from the liquid that they are packaged in so I think cleaning them off is key.

Also, Costco has a pretty good butter chicken sauce that I like to use, and I end up using one can for like 4 large chicken breasts.

1200isplenty,3aqb1a,randi3423,6,Mon Jun 22 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"Everything I cook is high protein - you can check out some of the things I've posted, but here are some ideas to get you going:  Easiest way to make it low cal high protein is to concentrate on your meats for dinner - try and use more lean meats like chicken breast/thighs and turkey to make meatballs, baked chicken parmesan, even things like butter chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The key is to use little to no oil for cooking, make a little sauce go a long way (seriously, I found using half the sauce I used to still tastes just as delicious for most things), and use lots of herbs and spices for flavour. Even if your meat ends up taking up 200-400 calories of your dinner, that'll be quite filling so you can make an easy side salad to go along with it and be stuffed.   Alternatively, I spend about 100-300 cal on my meats for dinner, and my favourite pairings are with mini potatoes, butternut squash, spaghetti squash or steamed veggies. If I'm still hungry in the evenings I can easily make a spinach/tomato/balsamic vinegar salad (sometimes with goat cheese and/or pecans) and it's only 50 extra calories or less.   Hope those few tips help!"

There was very little time for slowly adjusting, and calorie counting right off the bat just made me wiser at picking food because I like having a lot of food to eat, especially throughout the day.   I think if I slowly cut down like some people prefer - things like 100cal less at first, then 200cal - I'd probably have a harder time motivating myself and not reverting back to my previous eating habits.   Of course, I have the added bonus of dealing with obsessive counting habits right now, but if you don't have perfectionistic tendencies that shouldn't be a problem :)"

You can increase the amount of sauce and pair it with cauliflower rice for a great low carb meal.  Also, my husband repeatedly requests this cheeseburger salad. http://www.emilybites.com/2015/04/cheeseburger-salad.html.

Super easy. Season the meat with fresh herbs and garlic, or any kind of simple spices. It's an easy meal to multiply to prep for lunches throughout the week.  As for low cal lunches, get some high-fiber, low-cal flatbreads. Fill with veggies, maybe chicken or tuna, and spread with mustard/laughing cow cheese/low-cal sauce of your choice.

Since most people remember when something tasted good, and not when it was too high in calories restaurants are going to add an obscene amount of oil and butter to their food to keep customers coming back.   So, my guideline that keeps me sane is this: assume every dish on the menu is 1,000 calories. Budget for a 500 calorie meal (I use my fitness pal, and a little notebook to keep track), and get a to go box for the rest.   Then, you still have 700 calories you can distribute over the rest of your day according to your preference. Maybe, a 300 calorie breakfast, a 300 calorie lunch, and a 100 calorie snack somewhere in there?   And don't worry too much. If you don't eat out often, your progress/maintenance isn't going to be ruined by a rare, slight under estimate of calories.   Oh!

If your diet isn't filling, just replace starches with vegetables until you reach a good equilibrium and make up the calories elsewhere.

You'd do better drinking a Grande Starbucks skinny vanilla latte, which is 120 calories. Or their skinny mocha, which is 100 calories. It's mostly milk and flavoured syrup, with two shots of espresso. It's probably your best introduction to artificial sweeteners.  Otherwise, I'd really recommend switching to Splenda and skim milk. I find Splenda to be sweeter than sugar, so 1/2 a packet = 1 generous teaspoon. I usually have 3-4 cups of coffee per day (about 15-20 calories altogether). I add 1/2 a Splenda to each, and to one I usually add coconut creamer (10 cal for 2 tbsp), which makes it REALLY sweet. You're going to have to experiment to see what you like."

The steps I took:   First, figure out your TDEE -- the calories you need every day to maintain your lifestyle. Then subtract either 500 or 1000 from it to lose weight. If you download an app like MyFitnessPal (MFP), it'll do this for you! Start with 1lbs a week, and then go lower if you want to. Then take pictures of yourself in your underwear: from the front, the side, and the back. THEN use a tape measurer to measure your bust, your waist, your hips, your thighs, etc. Take those photos! Be committed! It's hard to see weight loss on ourselves, and sometimes the scale just doesn't move, but you WILL see results in your pictures and your measurements! Plan your meals in advance! Don't let one food item ruin your day -- one rogue donut and suddenly you're skipping dinner to stay within your calorie limit, and that's no fun. So plan every meal at first. Either weigh every item on a food scale or measure it with a cup or spoon. I know that sounds tedious, but it'll only take you a week to get the hang of things. After that, you'll start instinctively knowing what a serving looks like, and it'll go much faster! Don't forget to log items like oil that you use in the pan, or milk in your coffee and tea! MFP will remember what you usually eat, for easy clicking the next time. Basically, be prepared. Take 10 minutes in the evening to do this, so you don't have to spend 30 minutes planning your meal when you just want to eat. You will be hungry at first. It takes time to adjust, but you WILL adjust! You may need to learn what natural hunger feels like. You might have to learn how to comfortably wait until dinner, instead of snacking at the first stomach growl. You need to learn to distinguish ""psychological"" eating from actually being hungry and needing to eat. You need to learn how to get the most out of your calories. It takes time, but you will eventually be comfortable. It took me about 7 days. Dieting SHOULD NOT be starvation, feeling sick, feeling dizzy, etc -- even in the beginning. You should up your calorie count if you feel that way! Go to the grocery store and find low-cal options of what you usually eat. Baby steps! Instead of your usual loaf of bread, buy the low calorie bread. Buy yogurt that's 50 cal per serving instead of 100 calories. Take your time, and figure out what kind of food IS low calorie! You don't need to buy mung beans, spinach, and tofu to lose weight if that's not what you usually eat. There's grocery lists floating around this sub that can help you.  Figure out what works for you. Some people like 3 large meals a day and nothing more. Some people prefer to snack throughout the day. Some like a small breakfast and a big dinner, and some like the opposite. Some people eat ""clean"" (no refined foods), and some don't. Some people plan their entire day, and some leave about 200 calories for unpredictable snacks. Some people like carbs, some prefer fats! It takes time, but you get there. If you like sugar and sweets, incorporate them into your day! Put them in your bag to avoid temptation when going out! I have a square of dark chocolate, 1/2 a granola bar, and a Diet Coke almost every day. Once a week I'll buy a skinny vanilla latte from Starbucks. It keeps me sane, and stops me from having cravings and binging on junk food. If you need a 1500 cal cheat day once a week, do it. Don't listen to people who say there's a ""superior"" way to diet (clean eating, no caffeine, no carbs, whatever). Do what works for you. At first, I ONLY paid attention to my calories. I didn't consider sugar, carbs, protein, fat, or healthy eating in general. I didn't exercise at first. Changing your diet is a BIG lifestyle change, so start small! After I was used to 1200 calories, I slowly began to adjust my macronutrients. I realized I was hungry if I didn't get enough fat or protein, so I started exchanging that slice of bread for a can of tuna, or that granola bar for a cheese string. You get more food volume if you eat healthy (compared to eating only low calorie junk food, for instance), so you'll adjust! You'll learn to get the most out of your day -- and again, this is done by planning your meals in advance! After I balanced my meals and got more bang for my buck, I started exercising.   I know it seems overwhelming, but most of this comes naturally after you take the first step. You have to change the way you think, and that takes time. Find things you like about your calorie counting while navigating those uncomfortable first steps (because any new experience is going to be awkward, at first). I love being organized, so I enjoy planning my meals for each day! I love watching the scale go down. I love finding low calorie options of my favourite high calorie meals. I stopped eating fast food and restaurant food, and I don't buy nearly as much junk in the grocery store, so I save that money for fun things -- cute workout clothes, expensive fresh fruits (like berries) and fish, and cute shoes!   Don't think of it as dieting. Try to make it a fun, rewarding experience."
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,TheHermitGirl,6,Sat Jun 20 05:47:20 2015 UTC,There's a lot of great advice in this comment.  I have had many rounds of attempting to lose weight and kind of told myself it was too hard or I couldn't eat that little. I have been doing well at 1200/cal a day. I promised myself I needed to stick with it for three weeks and it would get easier. It has. I can see myself sticking with this until I hit my goal.  My only disagreement with this comment is that you may find it easier by paying a little attention to your macros. I am finding myself better satisfied by adding more protein into my meals. Too many simple carbs just use up too many of my calories without keeping my hunger in check. I also find the fiber in fruits and vegetables helps satisfy me.
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,Jenjenmi,4,Sat Jun 20 18:21:37 2015 UTC,"Damn, what else is there to add when this is so thorough? :) I wish this was in a beginners FAQ or something!"
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,sunrisesunbloom,5,Sat Jun 20 19:48:28 2015 UTC,"a lot of people here actually don't stick to just 1200 calories. have you figured out your TDEE yet? there's a calculator in the sidebar on the right. you should try TDEE-250 or TDEE-500 in the beginning, or even just focus on staying at maintenance calories just to get accustomed to weighing, counting, and logging everything. if you do good with these numbers then you can slowly increase your deficit depending on how much you need to lose. 1200 may be too low for you. it's too low for a good portion of the general population, especially if you're active."
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,LevyWife,7,Sat Jun 20 04:04:56 2015 UTC,I don't do 1200 but come here for low calorie meal/snack ideas.
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,thepowerbaaaaallll,3,Sat Jun 20 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"Same. I workout a lot, so I'm at 1600. But this sub is still a lifesaver!"
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,PenisTrain,6,Sat Jun 20 15:06:52 2015 UTC,"Whenever you are trying to reduce your portion size/calorie intake/etc, you will feel hungry. Your body is used to getting a certain amount of food and now it's not getting it. When I first started a low calorie diet (Note that I eat around 1400 a day, 1200 is too low for me. Figure out what range is safe for you to eat every day) I was ravenous and lethargic for the first week. After the first week adjustment period, I felt fine. And when I do feel hunger it doesn't bother me nearly as much. Feeling hunger is natural, and if you ride it out you'll find hunger is much less frequent and bothersome then before."
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,ComelyChatoyant,4,Sat Jun 20 16:36:55 2015 UTC,"Most important: Calorie counting.  Meal tracking.  Cut back a little bit at a time, don't go from whatever you're eating right now to 1200 calories.   Longer version: I didn't change all at once. I went from not counting calories to counting.  (I'd done it before, just not for a few years.  I started again.) I saw I was eating about 1800-1900 a day.  Then I got my basal metabolic rate tested.  It's 1700, which means that if I didn't do -any- exercise at all and ate 1200 calories a day, I'd lose roughly a pound a week. I do a fair bit of exercise, mostly because it helps my mental health.    Once I figured out that I didn't actually NEED to eat 2000 calories to maintain, I could get my head into the game of eating less.  In the US, we're told that 2000 calories is what the average adult needs.  That's not actually true for everyone!  So, I went from 1800 to 1600 for a couple of weeks.  Then down to 1400 for a couple of weeks.  Then down to 1200 for six weeks.  At 1200 I could see the weight coming off, but I was RIDICULOUSLY hungry.  So, I went back up to 1300 - 1350  My weight keeps coming off, roughly four pounds a month if I don't cheat too much.   One other thing.  I work in restaurants.  Drinking a LOT of water and a fair bit of espresso helps with the hunger pangs.  I love coffee and it's not a hardship for me to drink it.  I also started taking extended release Adderall which, like coffee, will mildly suppress your appetite.  It's not that I'm never hungry, I'm just better able to ignore the hunger. (I need the Adderall for serious ADD that finally got diagnosed, but the ""ignore the hunger"" was a nice side effect.)"
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,matchy_blacks,3,Sat Jun 20 19:10:15 2015 UTC,One other thing that is very much a personal preference.  I eat Quest protein bars.  They fill me up and they're sweet.  Having them on hand helps me make 'better' choices.  They're not the 'best' choice -- meat and veg would be better for me -- but they're way better than 500 calories or more of fast food. Basically have a food item that is satisfying to you that you can eat in a pinch instead of higher-calorie choices.
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,matchy_blacks,2,Sat Jun 20 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"I'm actually on a net-1200-cal diet, which means I let myself eat back calories I spend working out, so I generally average more like 1300-1400 total calories on days where I get a decent workout (400-500 calories burned). As much as I like this sub, I don't find some of the meals people make here all that appetizing, just because they're so healthy or so small IMO. I don't love vegetables, and it's hard for me as an Asian to give up rice, so I say fuck it and pretty much eat what I want to eat, just with smaller portions. I want to let you know that it can be done! Just to give you some examples, these were my lunches last week: 2 slices of pizza, leftover Thai chicken curry, fried rice, and a chicken burger. The portions are smaller than what I'd usually eat, but over time, my stomach has shrunk and I don't feel as hungry, but I still get to eat what I want to eat so I don't really feel deprived."
1200isplenty,3ah7s4,drzoidburger,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:21:35 2015 UTC,"Figure out on average how many calories you usually consume, and reduce by 100. The next day, reduce again, continuing to track your calories (I use myfitnesspal personally). Take as long as you need to get down to the deficit you're aiming for. You'll be reducing anyway. This worked well for me, as it wasn't a shock to suddenly be eating so much less. It also helps you slowly learn self control, consistency as far as tracking goes, and to be more mindful of what you're eating.   Also, as you're doing that you can start figuring out your 'problem areas' with food. Mine are too many carbohydrates, which make me hungry, and mindless snacking.  I really think a day or two of tracking how you normally eat is important at the beginning, because it forces you to be really honest with yourself."

I've fit in a number of restaurant meals on 1200 calories.. it just involves careful planning and balancing out calories for the rest of the day. Kind of jealous though because I think I'd struggle to fit in 440 calories of ice cream with the way I've been splitting my meals unless it was literally a replacement for my dinner. I usually do 200-300 at breakfast (I'm not someone who can skip easily), 400ish at lunch and 500ish at dinner. I'd have to cut my other meals a lot to squeeze in 440 of ice cream.. but it seems like a worthwhile challenge!"

My salads generally go more like 300-400 calories because they are enormous with lots of bulky veggies and because I tend to put either a protein or fat element on top of them.. like nuts, avacado, chicken, chickpeas, cheese.. stuff like that. The veggies are low cal but I tend to put something more calorific with the salad  which takes what would be 100 calories of veggies up to more like a 300 calorie salad. I either don't do dressing or I go with a very low cal dressing (20 cals for a tablespoon). And then I'll have something like a yogurt or a piece of fruit like you do too sometimes! I don't really do crackers much because I try to watch my carbs. I'd rather have a small portion of something fatty/protein but that is very satisfying like 20 grams of cheese or half an avocado or whatever than crackers (I find crackers just make me hungrier?) But yeah.. I definitely could cut things down to smaller portions somewhat to fit in an occasional treat, I'm just not sure where I'd fit in 440 calories of ice cream without flat out skipping a meal/making the ice cream my dinner (since 450-500 ish is usually my entire dinner). But I'm sure it could be done.. I'd just have to go with a much ligher lunch/breakfast."

1200isplenty,3aegs2,stupidrobots,-4,Fri Jun 19 22:31:48 2015 UTC,"The point of this meal is the great nutritional value while staying under 1200 kcal. Apart from Vitamin B12 you get almost everything you would need from a day of food, even the essential fatty acids (see my recipe comment). What you miss out on B12 (which is stored in the liver) that day, you can easily catch up another day by eating some fish or meat.  Proper Nutrition on a 1200 kcal diet over a long period is almost impossible, as you don't have a lot of food items, that add up to get you all you need for the day. And you can't catch up the next day, because you have to have to get that days' worth as well.  So, it's important to also watch Vitamins and Minerals, too see you get at least most of it. At least for a healthy diet. If you only care to lose weight however (which is not a good idea), strictly calorie counting does that. Your Hamburger Hash looks very nice, and you surely get a very decent haul of nutrients out of this, but I don't see much Calcium, Potassium or Fiber in it.  The posted meal is nothing fancy, but it does a good job for nutrition (I can't say anything about taste, as that differs with every person, but personally, I like it a lot). It's low cost and low effort. And 1.3 kg is a lot of food, you don't have to eat it all at once. Compared to the Hamburger Hash (~0.94 kg), which again looks great, the bowl of potatoes, spinach and carrots has about 35% of food mass on top. All of it highly dense in nutrients per calorie, even the sunflower oil and the flax seeds."
1200isplenty,3aegs2,flyrobotfly,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, over 500 kcal from potatoes. It also has 40 g of flax seeds that bring over 200 kcal and a tablespoon of sunflower oil having almost 150 kcal.  But it's a great meal for a 1200 kcal diet, with almost all of the nutrients you so desperately need while eating that little food. And as 1.3 kg is a lot of food (The picture may not give it the credit it deserves). I'd have trouble eating it in one sitting, even while being hungry on an intermittent fasting day."

I stick to 1200 calories or slightly fewer, and jog 20 mins a day if I can be arsed (realistically 3x a week). In these 18 days I had 4 fuck-up days, where I ate Chinese takeout/crisps/ice cream, so really this is two weeks progress. But I noticed that even on the days I went over my limit, I didn't find myself frantically binging like I always have in the past. It was more like 'oh, here's some nice food. I'm gonna eat till I feel full'. I think it's really helped with my binge eating problems. I allow myself to eat whatever I want, but just less of it & I log everything in MFP and plan ahead. For example, last night I had a peach for breakfast, a salad for lunch and sushi for dinner which was obviously very low calorie, so I could drink in the evening without going over my calorie limit (and I also had a drunken ice cream on my way home and managed to stay at 1200!).

1200isplenty,3aa6hd,CaptainOfYourSoul,60,Thu Jun 18 13:19:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, so, as an ex-terrible, emotional binge eater that used to be 210lbs at 5'3"" (now 133lbs), here's me on my little soapbox. This may not be helpful for everyone, but I hope it's helpful to at least some:    The healthiest thing you can do for yourself is to find an alternative outlet for your stress. Using food as a comfort to suffocate negative emotions (stress, sadness, anger, boredom, etc) will always, eventually, cause you to 'fall off the wagon' and binge. Your attempts to lose weight and become healthy will always be sabotaged by this attitude towards food.    You are not helpless. You are not a victim of your emotions. Yes, you can find a way to stop yourself. You are in control, always. Please don't fall into the ""I can't help myself"" trap. You own yourself, your emotions do not own you.     Every time you eat, you are choosing to eat. Every time you eat to excess, you are consciously choosing obesity and poor health. It sounds cruel, but it's the truth. You are not helpless. YOU control you. Always.    Yes you feel stressed. Feeling stressed feels awful. Food feels good, the motions are soothing and the brain releases happy chemicals. It's an easy solution to use the latter to 'cure' the former. Food is your drug of choice, no more different than the smoker that reaches for the pack after a stressful shift. Both are unhealthy coping methods.    Try to make eating a conscious decision. Look at the food. Process what it is. Is it healthy? Do you NEED it, or do you WANT it to 'fix' your emotions? Will this food make you healthy, or will it make you sick? Will it help you achieve the body you want, or will it lead you to obesity? What are the consequences, good and bad, of eating this food? Visualize the consequences, then ask yourself - do I really need to eat this? Do I DESERVE to do this to myself, or do I deserve better?     I'll give you a hint: Yes, you do deserve better. You deserve more than that bag of chips, that pizza, that box of ice cream bars. You are worth so much more than what you're giving yourself. You are worth so much more than to suffocate yourself with food. You deserve health and happiness.     You are punishing your body by binging to sooth your emotions. You are the parent, and your emotions are the tantruming 2-year-old in the aisle of the grocery store, kicking and screaming and making grabby-hands at Little Debbie because ""it's not fair"" and ""I deserve it"" and ""I'm stressed"".     What's so bad about stress, anyway? Why do we run to the fridge to chase away a bad day at work or school? Why are we afraid to experience bad emotions and let them run their course? Unpleasant emotions are just a part of life, and we have to learn how to deal with them in productive ways - ways that can help us, not hurt us.     Why are you stressed? Write a list of everything that's stressing you out. Brainstorm solutions. Start with little changes. This process will give you a feeling of productivity and power and control. Exercise helps with stress, even walking will do, especially if being IN the house is a cause of your stress.     Don't use food as an opiate to cope because food honestly and truly won't help you. Food CAN'T help you - it's an inanimate substance not capable of caring about you or anything. Only you can help you. You CAN help you. Allow yourself to feel stressed, sad, angry - your body is telling you that something is wrong, don't shut it up with food. These emotions are opportunities for change and growth, don't run from them.        You control you. You are not helpless. You can do it."

It's kinda fun, because I've been progressively losing weight the last 6 months, but I've never felt deprived. According to My Fitness Pal, I need about 1200 cal per day to lose 1.5 pounds per week so I try to go below that, even if it's just 1 calorie under.  Of course, I also swim for my exercise and according to MFP, an hour can burn as much as 400 calories. I try to eat about 500 calories for breakfast and lunch (oatmeal or cereal), put in an hour of swimming in the afternoon (yeah community pool!) and then I'd have burned away most of my morning meals and so I'll go to McDonalds and have a cheeseburger (313 calories) or even to my local Japanese place and have a bowl of rice (200 cals) and some shrimp tempura (around 80 cals per pieces, I'd usually have 3). Then I can still have around 500 calories for dinner and stay under my goal.   Eating back your calories is the fun part of using MFP. I get to lose weight and eat at least one thing I want for dinner.  Of course, this works if you're not trying to lose a lot of weight quickly. I'm about 7 pounds away from my goal and once I reach it, I'll switch the settings of MFP to maintain and i can have an extra 100 cals per day :)"

There's tons of summer gourmet food markets, my company is currently only at one of them. I'd rather not give out my work location online, but pretty much anyone who makes lobster rolls will give your something that looks like this, on bread with a bit of melted butter. It's cheaper for them to give you only claw and knuckle meat, however, the price is often as much as an entire lobster including the tail, if you know where to look. There are a couple restaurants in NYC who can serve a 1.5 lb lobster, with sides, for as little as $20... A lobster roll can be as much as $25 and there's no tail and it's only 3 oz. It's convenience, though."

You're going overboard, and that will only cause you to fall of the wagon once more. Don't stress your weight loss--you'll get there! But only if you do it in a healthy, sustainable way. Your body needs calories, and it needs the nourishment you gain from food. If you cut that out, it won't take long for you to start feeling awful. Your energy will disappear, as will your mood and patience. Soon enough your malnourished body will start to scream for food, giving you strong, hard-to-fight cravings that will ultimately make it even harder for you to stay on track.  TL;DR: There are no shortcuts to a healthy body. You have to play the long game."

So technically, you should eat 1920 calories per day, and lose 2 pounds per week. PLUS the calories you burn during exercise/activity will only add to your rate of loss if you don't eat them back (which it sounds like you don't).  You shouldn't be eating more than a 1000 deficit from your TDEE to sustain a healthy rate of loss (1-2 pounds per week) and not put yourself at risk for health issues as you go.

For example, if I wanted to go to a Whole Foods, it's about an hour drive, which just isn't feasible unless I have business in town already. And we don't have a Trader Joes anywhere nearby.  So despite living right outside a large city, I'm still stuck with Walmart, which has a very limited selection in terms of health food.   Where I used to live, on the other hand, I could bike 10 minutes and get to a TJs or a WFs, because despite being in a much smaller city, it was full of health conscious people. It really depends on the culture of your city, as well as your location."

RCSS/Loblaws has a whole bunch of diet pops in their own line aka President's choice.. the diet cranberry pop and diet sparking lemonade are both decent tasting in my opinion.. I don't drink them super often but I actually like them on occasion as low-cal mixers for vodka.   Overall I agree though.. we have a decent selection of products compared to many countries I'm sure but  I would say the US seems to have way, way more.. it seems like they have an endless selection of products and brands and flavours compared to us, and also a wider variety of grocery store chains. Here we mostly have a few major companies that all own each other (Sobey's own Fresh Co, Loblaws own RCSS and NO Frills, etc) plus Wal Mart and Costco.   We do have some healthier places in my area (GTA).. there's a chain called Sprouts which has a few locations, that ""Fit for Life,""  chain which is in a lot of malls/shopping plazas, and where I am we have a local salad bar/juice bar which has really healthy salads.

That would cause their weight to go up without affecting the caloric content, so it's better to base your calorie count off the raw weight.  Similarly, meat will lose water when cooked, so again you'll get the most accurate estimate if you use the raw weight to determine calories."

I guess I was mainly taking issue with calling a bowl of refined carbs healthy, not with the processed cheese... I find 2 little wedges of the laughing cow done with lots of veggies and a small serving of whole wheat pasta and a source of lean protein.. I don't consider it as bad as white pasta and velveeta with little protein/fiber. Just my opinion though, I try not to eat white pasta because it has little nutritional value in my own opinion and based on my experiences with what satisfies my body's needs, but everyone has their own idea of healthy and their own bodily needs. It's definitely an option to use real cheese which would be much more natural, if that's what a person prefers.. the real cheese tends to contain a lot more calories though so you'll have to use less if you're a 1200-er and it's harder to get a proper cheese sauce type feel with very little cheese and without doing a roux (butter + flour = more calories). But definitely comes down to preference and what a person can fit into their daily calories."

Going to the gym for some exercise takes an hour or two.. sure, you have to put some effort but it's over in an hour, and you can pat yourself on the back and go gome. Counting calories and not over-eating literally requires constant vigilance and self-discipline.. you can't snack on extra calories, you can't have ""just a few bites,"" you can't drink sugary stuff and not count it. If you're someone who craves junk food or over-eating you constantly have to say no to yourself.

If I had to keep a paper diary and figure out portions and do all the math myself, I would definitely get discouraged. But with my fitness pal, I can track my calories in less than 10 minutes a day. Granted, I've been doing it for a while now, but even in the beginning, it's pretty easy, quick and self explanatory.   And, it's not that hard to just eat less. If someone was eating way more food than they should be, a little bit of mindfulness goes a long way. I mean, I still eat junk I'm not supposed to, but it'll be 2 cookies instead of 6. Two pieces of bacon instead of 5. It just needs to be stuck with. It's easy to get discouraged when the weight doesn't melt off immediately, but once it starts happening, it's  a great motivator."

My point was just that I think from a lot of people's perspectives (not saying this represents me.. personally I'm in the swing of counting calories so it goes fast like you say).. they think they can exercise a bit each day or a few times a week and that's a fairly small commitment/effort compared to literally watching what goes in your mouth 24/7.. exercise is seen more of an easy fix in a way since you just go, sweat for an hour and then you're done, it's much more temporary really.. not to say exercise is easy but in some ways its can be seen as easier than dramatically cutting portions down, giving up foods you love, etc etc. It depends on different people though.. definitely for people who have a tendency to snack a lot or overeat a lot.. in some ways it's more of a sacrifice and requires more self-discipline to stop over-eating than to spend some time at the gym. It's easy to say to just be mindful and I agree that that's what it comes down to ultimately.. calories in/calories out and all that.. but for some people who are very addicted to food or very used to large portions all their life it IS hard to say no to having another cookie.

1200isplenty,3a3srp,cindythebean,6,Wed Jun 17 13:22:47 2015 UTC,This is literally exactly what I do. I eat all my calories between 12:30pm and 8:30pm. It makes it insanely easy to stay at the 1200 mark and not feel deprived.
1200isplenty,3a3srp,stefanhof,2,Wed Jun 17 02:43:52 2015 UTC,I've been doing the same thing and I love it. BUT I worry I'm missing out on the supposed metabolism boost you get from eating breakfast?
1200isplenty,3a3srp,stefanhof,2,Wed Jun 17 03:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I used to worry about that, too. But I've done research on it, and there are arguments both ways. For me it was a matter of listening to my body. Last year I had a physically demanding job, so I made myself eat breakfast even though I wasn't ready for it. I could stay at around 1400-1500 calories per day, but I had a hard time dipping below that. I was losing about 1 to 1.5 pounds per week.   When I started working from home I was already skipping breakfast because I just didn't want it. When I read about intermittent fasting and its benefits, I decided to give it a go because I was practically already there. Now I'm losing 2 pounds per week like clockwork. I think it's mainly because I'm able to keep a tighter control on my calories, but there are claims that it burns more fat. I don't know about that, but I like how I eat and I love what my scale shows."

1200isplenty,3a3srp,itsnotmeitsyouasshat,3,Wed Jun 17 03:02:15 2015 UTC,"There is usually a proportion of ""fating"" and ""feeding hours. Mine was 16hr fast and 8 hour feed. I ate from 12pm - 8pm and usually followed a smaller lunch - about 1/3 of TDEE - then have a huge dinner - 1/2 TDEE - and about 1/6 dedicated to post-workout protein! /r/leangains is basically a bunch of people doing IF. They're very helpful and there are a bunch of resources too!"
1200isplenty,3a3srp,Jenjenmi,4,Wed Jun 17 04:38:58 2015 UTC,I mostly keep my breakfast and lunch to under 200 cal each and sometimes I skip one or the other. Sometimes I skip both. I worked nights for well over a decade and I am still a night owl despite getting up at 6 AM. I'm a night time snacker/eater so I save my calories for supper and snacks. It works for me.
1200isplenty,3a3srp,ChimeraThree,3,Wed Jun 17 04:22:20 2015 UTC,"I think that 2 meals a day works best for me, either breakfast and dinner or lunch and dinner, depending on the day."
1200isplenty,3a3srp,TIGERFIREJUMP666,3,Wed Jun 17 00:37:38 2015 UTC,"intermittent fasting  Personally, I usually have a coffee or protein shake (1-3hundred cals depending on my mood) at 8 or so in the morning and then only eat solid food between 4-9pm.  I feel sluggish if I don't have the coffee or protein shake, but it's not impossible for me to do if I have enough water to drink.      The best thing to do is listen to your body and drink a TON of water.  People talk about OD'ing on water but the chance of that happening is very very low.  Fasting isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, especially if you're only doing it for part of a day.  Drinking a lot of liquids will help with any hunger pangs and keep you hydrated. Keep in mind coffee and tea is usually 0 calories before cream and sugar, too."

I will say it's a worthwhile investment if you want to try different recipes as it gives you a grocery list, nutritional count and almost everything gets used up. There are different categories: gluten free, veggie, lunch etc. and in the regular meal plan there's one fish dish and one veggie dish per week.

Even with the weak Canadian dollar at the moment, prices at the real TJ's are also significantly cheaper, which makes complete sense because Pirate Joe's owner doesn't get any discounts: he just buys items like any other shopper...or gets other people to shop for him because he's been banned from their stores.

When they are half cooked but still runny on top, add cold cooked rice cauliflower ""rice"" and stir-fry vigorously, breaking up the clumps of rice with your wok scoop or ladle and seasoning with soy sauce, salt and pepper to taste. Continue to stir-fry until the rice is very hot and smells wonderful. Finally, add a handful of finely sliced spring onion greens and stir a few times until you can smell them; then serve.

1200isplenty,39wovf,alysli,6,Mon Jun 15 12:57:31 2015 UTC,"As other posters have suggested, broccolli and spaghetti squash. You can add them to anything and it's so dang good.    The fact is, you aren't going to be able to eat like someone who is not watching their weight, period - volume or otherwise. You are probably going to feel hungry and unsatisfied for a good while on 1200. It took me a few months to adjust, at least. The best strategy is to just eat loads and loads of vegetables, and generally avoid meats and grains except one meal of the day.    My go-tos are spaghetti squash with (meatless) Prego sauce (70 calories per 1/2 cup) - or Skinnytaste's marinara if I have 20 mins to make it (60 calories per 1/2 cup) - and a few egg whites (omelet or scrambled) with tons of wilted spinach and/or shredded eggplant and 1/4 cup of fat free cheese/2% cheese.   Every day for lunch I'm eating some sort of roasted vegetable. Asparagus, bell pepper, cauliflower, broccolli, sugar snap peas or snow peas (I challenge you to eat 200 calories worth of either kind), and I LOVE celery root. Often you can eat a pound of vegetables with a teaspoon of oil and some seasoning. Sometimes I will make vegetable spring rolls as well, with shredded carrot, zucchini, minced garlic (in the glass jar you get at the grocery store), lettuce, onion & seasoning with rice paper wrappers. I also try to eat melon whenever I can (most are approx. 500 calories per entire melon).   If you must eat meat, seafood is great. Tuna, shrimp and scallops are very good on the calorie scale as long as they are not fried, are very flavorful and easy to prepare. These are my main sources of protein along with a daily shake. Thin sliced deli meats are also good for protein, are usually 10 cals per slice, but tend to be very high in sodium if that matters to you.   I get ravenous at night just like you and many others on this sub. If coffee doesn't affect you negatively at night, try having a scoop of protein powder (~150 cals, ~25g protein) with 8 oz coffee and optional 1/2 cup almond milk (30 cals) at or before dinner. This rounds out to about 182-183 calories, and if you drink it with a small meal it really helps fill it out. And it tastes like a coffee shake so you can't really go wrong with that.    I stick with very low calorie stuff most of the day, don't go over 400ish cals before dinner thanks to my veggie bros, and after dinner I usually have ~450 calories left which I then use to eat basically whatever I want.    Edit: AND BEANS. ALL THE TIME!! Refried beans are 180 calories per cup. They're good on any sort of wrap or salad. Yummmm"

One thing I've also found is that when I am doing this, I usually need to reserve around 100 -150 calories for something really dense and high calorie to help me get the satisfaction.

I've lately been cooking eggplant to death and it's awesome. Be careful not to add oil to it as it soaks it up and demands more. But it soaks up liquid flavor wonderfully and adds amazing bulk (300gram uncooked is only 48 cal).   The other thing I've found is that I am sure to save 150 calories for my late night fiend snacking and I've found peach+cottage cheese+low fat yogurt and a teaspoon of maple syrup is super filling and satisfying.

For example if your craving ice cream, swap it for some frozen yogurt, something salty? Swap kale chips, dried seaweed, or rice crackers instead of regular chips, popcorn? Try seasoning with nutritional yeast instead of butter, something sweet? Try dried/fresh fruit instead of processed sugary snacks/candy. Chocolate? Try cacao nibs (raw cocoa pieces) or dark 80% cocoa chocolate instead of the super sweet chocolate candy bars. These are all things that help satisfy my cravings and when I do let myself have the occasional treat I swear it tastes 10x better!  drink tea. Especially green tea. Sometimes after dinner when I'm getting those snack cravings I will tell myself to first have a cup of tea and often strangely enough after the tea I no longer feel like I need the snack eat breakfast. I find I am less likely to crave the extra calories at the end of the day if I eat a decent sized breakfast! My favs are oatmeal, smoothies and eggs. I think your body notices when you skip breakfast and causes cravings to be stronger later on because it's trying to replace the calories it missed out on in the morning!  remind yourself of your goals. Sometimes all it takes to say no to the late night snacks is to remember your goals and where you want your body to be and how you're going to get there. Like hey I'm going on vacation in a month and I wanna look great in my bikini! Do I really need this chocolate bar or can I hold off for tonight?

At first I cut my calories to 2000/day by findings low cal alternatives to my treats (diet soda instead of soda, rice crackers instead of soda crackers, sugar free coffee flavour syrup instead of cream and sugar etc).   Lots of whole foods that are high density and low cal so I'm eating a lot of food (actually probably more food than I did when I wasn't counting calories but just lower cal foods) and I don't feel hungry. I also made sure I stopped drinking my calories because that's just a total waste.  Once I got used to that and felt full at the end of the day I cut back to 1800cal and continued this way until now I eat under 1200 a day and have to find food to eat at the end of the day to get me up to over 1000cals even though I don't feel hungry.   Edit: I also found that eating full fat/high fat foods and less carbs helped me feel full and satiated more than when I was eating low fat foods."

I said it in my other post in here, but it's hard for many people to go from overeating to restricting at 1200 and not just fall off the bandwagon or constantly feel totally deprived. You aren't failing just because you're eating more than 1200. As long as you're eating at a deficit, you're succeeding. If you can get down to 1200, you'll get to where you want to be faster. But if only allowing yourself 1200 leads to periodic binges, it's hardly worth it. This sub is a great way to find low calorie meals and motivation, but eating 1200 isn't the only way to lose it."

1200isplenty,39se58,I_dont_wanna_,10,Tue Jun 23 06:45:35 2015 UTC,"I've always been a ""grazer"" when I'm at home, which is a habit I'm really trying hard to break. Here are some things I've been doing:   Plan out breakfast, lunch, and dinner the night before. I then put everything into MFP, so I know exactly how many additional calories I have for ""snacks."" Honestly, this has been most important for me. If I didn't plan (especially on weekends), I would only have 200 calories left by dinner, and I'd sabotage myself. Eat a light breakfast and lunch, don't snack at work. Breakfast is usually ~200kcal. It almost always involves an ""egg muffin"" and then either cottage cheese or a slice of toast with spinach & kale Greek yogurt dip. Lunch is usually around 300-350kcal. I keep no snacks at work. If someone offers food, I force myself to turn it down. I drink lots of tea & water during the day. This allows me to either eat a HUGE dinner of 600-700kcal, or I can eat a smaller dinner and some snacks. Don't have garbage snacks in the house. I've recently loosened the reigns on this in order to force myself to practice portion control. However, at first I did not allow myself any snacks like chips, cheez-its, etc. Now, I do have a box of cheez-its and a little bin of cookies. However, I carefully weigh out my portion and put the box away before I eat them. Sometimes I really do want to go back for more, but I just force myself not to. Do keep lots of low cal snacks in the house. Watermelon, cherries, carrots, peaches, etc. Bags of skinny pop or Trader Joe's reduced guilt popcorn are great, too. You can eat SO MUCH popcorn for ~110kcal. Also, if you have a weakness for dessert, sugar free Jello pudding has been a lifesaver for me recently. If I come home stressed from work and just want some fucking chocolate, I can eat a pudding for only 60kcal. Pre-portion out meals for the week. So, this mainly works if you are just cooking for yourself, but I've been making a meal (like spaghetti squash & turkey bolognese, for example) and immediately portioning out servings into to go containers. That way, I will not overeat at dinner, because the serving is already put together for me.  Build in some exercise to give yourself a tiny bit of wiggle room. Emphasis on tiny bit here, though. I bike to work most days. It's not a ton of exercise, but it adds up to ~40 miles per week, if I bike every day. That way, if I just feel SO hungry one day and want to go up to 1300-1400, it's okay. I have that little buffer. You just have to be careful not to use the exercise as an excuse to overeat daily."

Just a bit of a mind trick that works for me. Another thing I think really helps me is I consume a LOT of water. They say you should divide your weight (in pounds) in half and consume that many ounces- so that puts me at 80 oz? Yeah, I drink closer to 150 oz. I've read water is an appetite suppressant. Maybe that's true, but it definitely helps with the ""bored eating"" for me. I also work out, so those extra 400 calories I burn at the gym= an extra meal on days when I'm really hungry.

Other than that I've heard other people suggest chugging water, but that's actually never helped for me.

Change your myfitnesspal settings to only losing half a pound a week, which should put you closer to a 1500 daily allowance. If you're consistently ""failing"" with the standards you're currently holding yourself to, that can be demotivating, so maybe you'll do better if you're a little less strict. So you don't feel like you're on such a ""diet,"" you know?  I had trouble starting out too, and like others have posted, I find it's to my benefit to eat as little as possible without going hungry until dinner, because I have the least control then (I go out to eat a lot, eat what my family cooks, etc). I find if I snack I can skate by on <400cals till dinner easily. 150 for cereal&almond milk (same for oatmeal), 90 for a banana, 80 for yogurt, and 80 for string cheese, for example. Or I can do a grilled chicken breast over salad for like 260 for lunch. Just as a couple super easy no fuss examples of my days.  I also take fiber supplements (they're gummies) daily to help me feel full.   One last thing, the biggest favor I did myself was to buy a food scale. I found one in the kitchen wares aisle of my local grocery store for $25. I was counting calories meticulously for a while and not losing weight. I was measuring every single thing in measuring cups and spoons, and couldn't figure out where my extra caloric intake was coming from. When I got my scale, it turned out that I was overeating by about 20%. When a label would say a serving size is example: 1 cup (35g), I found that 35g would look like 3/4cup instead-- sometimes less! So just another thing to think about. Sorry for rambling and I hope I didn't say anything offensive/to make light of your struggle! Good luck!"

Do you spend an hour in a candy store? Try to figure out what's going on, and fix it. Maybe pack an extra snack at 4pm, and take something away from a meal to fit it in. Maybe analyze your meals to see if there's something that isn't keeping you as full as it should. I'm not sure what you're eating, so I can't help with specific suggestions, but try to figure out what's specifically causing it, and find a good solution to fix it. You're always going to have ""X makes me want to eat more"", so it's a good skill to have to try to figure out how to combat it based on your eating style."

I've found the key to success with weight loss/healthy living is to identify the problem, and come up with a solution for that problem. Another problem = find another solution.   Lower calorie snacks. Fruits and veggies are great, and easy to fit in. An entire cucumber is less than 40-50 calories, and berries are low calorie and delicious. Eat a smaller meal during the day to make room for your snacking. If snacking while relaxing is something that you need to do, plan for it. Eat a smaller lunch, and plan out your snack within the calories you have left. Learn to separate food/eating as a hobby from food/eating as a way of keeping your body going. This is what I chose to do, and was the best decision for my lifestyle. Now I still eat sometimes when I watch tv, while I work, etc, but I'm not eating BECAUSE of what I'm doing- they just happen to be taking up the same timespan. My biggest accomplishment was the first time I went to the movies and didn't load up on candy/popcorn/drinks. I had a water, and that was it, and I didn't even really drink it.

Don't go up and down each aisle, just go from item to item. You can't eat food that you don't have.  Buy fruits and vegetables that are easy to snack on. Something you don't need to stop and chop up and cook so when you want a lazy snack, its so easy to just stick your hand in the fridge and come out with a bunch of grapes or a banana or a handful of blueberries, etc.   Before you eat, drink a glass of water. Don't get lukewarm crap out of the tap. Get an awesome glass with dinosaurs on it, drop in a slice of lemon or lime, and plop a bendy straw or umbrella on top. Water is awesome and you should drink a lot of it. It will make your everything happy. Yes, you will pee, but you're supposed to pee, its okay. Go pee and high five yourself when it doesn't come out looking like concentrated apple juice.  What happens at 4 PM? Do you come home and flop down and shuffle through Netflix?

So, I don't count calories because of it and I don't log my food intake because that also contributes to my obsessiveness. Your blog looks like it would be very helpful for me to cut calories without obsessing. I can choose things for my menu for the week and be confident I am eating less. At least I'm going to try it and see if it works for me. I also like the bulking options since my boyfriend definitely does not need to eat like I should and, since I'm a lazy cook, I'm not about to cook two different meals."

But I think you need to consider a little more carefully how your original comment came across - whether you intended it or not, you sounded like you were criticizing OP. And I think that the thing that really upset people was that when OP responded to you (matching perceived rudeness with seemingly-justified snark), you got defensive and aggressive instead of just correcting yourself. If you'd just said ""oh, I guess my comment was confusing - what I meant to say is that I don't like avocado, so what else do you think might go well here"", people wouldn't have gotten angry.   I understand that it can be difficult to predict when you accidentally offend someone, but the correct response is to apologize and clarify, instead of getting defensive and angry."

You submit each ingredient individually and then input how many servings it makes and you can get the calorie/nutritional breakdown by servings...it's incredibly useful! And that way you can put in the total amount of whatever you use and not have to deal with wonky math
1200isplenty,39m145,itsadooozy,12,Fri Jun 12 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"Instead of putting serving sizes and estimating their size, you can put grams. For example, if the entire dish weighs 450 grams, you input 450 servings. Then you can weigh the portion on your plate and add that many servings, and you will know exactly how many calories you consumed."

1200isplenty,39m145,penaltylvl,5,Mon Jun 15 03:38:40 2015 UTC,"Weigh & calorie count everything individually before cooking. Then, figure out calories for whole thing.   If you are making even-sizes portions, divide the total calories for the whole meal by the number of portions you made.   If you and your SO eat different amounts, weigh our how much you get and how much he gets. Your calorie intake is the ratio you ate, calculated as (weight of your food)/(weight of your food + weight of his food), multiplied by the total calories in the dish.   For example, if I make pasta for my boyfriend & I and it is 1000 calories total and 300 grams total, I'm likely eating 120 grams to his 180. Thus, my calorie are (120/300)*1000 = 400 calories.   MFP lets you build a recipe and then divide it into servings and does the ratios for you, if that helps!"
1200isplenty,39m145,belowthreshold,3,Fri Jun 12 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"I use the recipe builder on MyFitnessPal.  Weigh the dish/pan/whatever empty, weigh all of the ingredients when I make it, then weigh the final product (cooking will make it lose moisture and thus weight so it's important to do it after).  Subtract the final weight from the weight of the pan to get the weight of the actual food, then make that the serving size in MFP.  For example, if something weighs 12 ounces,  put it in as 12 servings.    Then weigh the actual serving and log accordingly.  It's a little extra work but it's very accurate.  I keep a little notebook in a drawer in my kitchen for writing everything down while I cook.  Another option for things like casseroles is to make them in a cupcake pan instead of a casserole dish.  Count each ""cupcake"" as a serving.  You may need to reduce the cooking time a bit to keep the edges from burning."

1200isplenty,39dzh3,Dissonata,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"Oral allergy syndrome:       Oral allergy syndrome or OAS is a type of food allergy classified by a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth in response to eating certain (usually fresh) fruits, nuts, and vegetables that typically develops in adult hay fever sufferers.   OAS is perhaps the most common food-related allergy in adults. Developing this allergy later in life may lead to death or athsma-like attacks, ranging from 7 to 24 each day. OAS is not a separate food allergy, but rather represents cross-reactivity between distant remnants of tree or weed pollen still found in certain fruits and vegetables. Therefore, OAS is typically only seen in tree and weed allergic patients, and is usually limited to ingestion of only uncooked fruits or vegetables.   Another term used for this syndrome is pollen-food allergy. In adults up to 60% of all food allergic reactions are due to cross-reactions between foods and inhalative allergens.

I also didn't have any fresh herbs on hand so just used salt and pepper. 1 cup quinoa is ~220 calories, but there's also veggies in mine and a little fat free feta. Since the veggies are taking up space the one cup of salad I used is probably less than 220 calories but I figure it's better to over estimate.  Half an avocado - 100 calories. Half of a 75 calorie package of portobellos - estimated up to 40 calories.  Fun fact, if you drizzle just a little balsamic vinegar over the mushrooms, this meal gets like 3x as delicious.  Umm this was ridiculously filling, and vegetarian. I actually think this meal was vegan, come to think of it.  Also you do not need that much water to make quinoa, whoever wrote that recipe was smoking crack. Two cups water per every cup of dry quinoa you're cooking. Dump it in a pot of boiling water, wait till the boil comes back, then shut the burner down to the lowest setting after covering your pot. Leave it for twenty minutes.  FYI I made 1.5 cups quinoa which cooked came out to like... just a whole fucking bunch of food. I'd recommend only cooking 1/2 a cup, you'll have leftovers. I've never made quinoa before so... yeah.

Stuffed sweet potatoes, 2 portions:  1 large sweet potato (500 g) 150 g cauliflower 50 g beluga lentils (dry) 1 1/2 dl water 1/2 onion 2 green onions 1/2 green chili (or whole, if you prefer!) 1 tsp coriander powder 1 tsp garam masala 1/2 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp minced ginger 1 1/2 dl frozen green peas (thawed) pinch of coarse salt 1/2 tbsp oil  Bake sweet potato at 200°C for about an hour, until soft. Cut cauliflower into florets, place in an oven dish with some water and bake with sweet potato for the last 20-25 minutes, until softened. Boil beluga lentils in 1 1/2 dl water until soft, 20-25 minutes.  Heat oil in pan, add coriander powder, garam masala, cumin and ginger. Chop onion, green onions and chili and sauté until softened.  Cut sweet potato in half, lengthwise and scoop out the flesh (leave a bit at the edges to make it easier to fill) and put in a bowl. Mash lightly with a fork, but not too much, big chunks are good! Add (drained) cauliflower, lentils, onions and peas and mix well.  Place the skins in an ovenproof dish and divide the filling between them. Bake at 200°C for 5-7 minutes, then turn on the broiler and cook for a further 3-4 minutes.  The calories are for the sweet potato only; not the bulgur on the plate, that's just a serving suggestion!

What people SHOULD say (and normally DO say but something must've gotten lost here) is ""Don't eat back your calories, calculate your TDEE and eat at a deficit.""  The reason people say not to eat back calories burned is because estimations of calories burned are often horribly inaccurate and overstated.  MFP is terrible at it, most if not all exercise machines are easily double what actuals would be - the only reliable way to estimate is with a really good heart rate monitor, but those really only work during steady-state cardio, they don't help with HIIT, weight lifting, etc."

I work out often and eat about 1400-1500, depending on my hunger/vigor of workouts, and that works for me, although I'm not losing quite as quickly as you.

It is only a little extra work but it works for me. My problem is when there isn't a small change to make so either one of us would be unhappy or we would have to make two completely different meals. My only way of compromising this time was to use healthier toppings.

The zucchini boats are great for holding pizza toppings, but they won't satisfy a craving for bread-y goodness.    Or maybe put pizza toppings on a tortilla?  Those are much closer to an actual pizza flavor-wise, and medium tortillas are usually around half the calories of a pita."

He hates cottage cheese, but I will never tell him how much he eats it.  Luckily my husband loves veggies so he's okay with zoodles.  If he is craving Mexican food ill make enchiladas. Throw raw chicken, salsa, onions, jalepenos, and bell peppers in the crockpot in the morning, then it's ready when you get off work.  The chicken shreds easily with two forks. I wrap the chicken in corn tortillas and use low fat sour cream, laughing cow, and a can of enchilada sauce, and bake it for 30 minutes. The chicken is really good on rice also.  I slowly switched from ground beef to ground turkey, which he hated at first, but now he doesn't even notice.  On pizza night make huge side salads with tons of veggies and eat the salads first, then make the pizzas. I use lots of fresh herbs and seasoning on everything also, so there is still a lot of flavor even if I skip on cheese or oils.  Luckily I love to cook, I could spend an hour looking up recipes online and taking screen shots on my phone.  For every bad for you recipe, there is a healthy version online.

1200isplenty,38we5x,idontbuyitsodonttry,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:51:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. Was thinking of the latter. I love Cheesestrings though so it's all good.
1200isplenty,38we5x,mostmediumturtle,2,Mon Jun 8 12:06:00 2015 UTC,"This was basically my weekly grocery list when I lived in the states. I'm in Japan now and can't really get most of that anymore.    Veg and especially fruit is outrageously expensive. A single apple is around $1.20. Most of the cheese here is processed ""cheese,"" and cheese sticks are about the size of a cigarette (and also about a buck apiece). Real cheese will run you ~$4 an ounce.    No egg beaters, which I used to love for protein shakes. Don't eat meat, but peanut butter is rare and expensive. I know one store where I can buy it, and the smallest jar of Skippy (the stubby little 12oz one) is $7-8.    Yogurt here is nasty and full of gelatin. Don't really have any fiber/protein/granola bars. There are nuts, thankfully, but mostly peanuts, and everything else is pricey. No chia seeds, definitely no low-sugar pudding (pudding is weird here, also full of gelatin).    On the other hand, I do have access to dirt cheap konjac blocks and noodles. :/"
1200isplenty,38we5x,Ariadne89,2,Tue Jun 9 01:05:50 2015 UTC,that's frustrating. it seems we're pretty spoiled in the states in terms of variety and affordability. I get all this from Walmart. why did you move?
1200isplenty,38we5x,Ariadne89,2,Tue Jun 9 10:05:47 2015 UTC,"I get restless if I go too long without traveling, and I landed a great job here. I mean, I miss a lot of things from North America, but moving to Japan was an incredible opportunity for me. There's really good food here, too, but I wish Japanese went in for ""health food"" more.    Oh, another weird thing: you can't really get whole wheat bread here. Most bread is white, sold in a crustless ""loaf"" of ~5 slices -- each of which is twice as thick as American bread, and both taller and wider than my hand. A typical slice of bread is about 180 calories. Sooo, yeah, I don't eat bread anymore, haha. This is on top of all the white rice they eat; I constantly get passive-aggressive comments for eating brown rice."

Asparagus is my favourite vegetable - it's in season at the moment yay!  I've never heard of plum vinegar. What do you use it for?  Good point about going to bakeries. In future I'd rather buy a small amount of nice/quality bread from a bakery as opposed to too much standard, boring bread."

1200isplenty,38we5x,dietbroccoli,18,Mon Jun 8 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"On a weekly basis:   Dairy/Refridgerated Section - Eggs, greek yogurt, almond milk (the refridgerated kind.. technically not dairy but you get why I'm including it), and usually 1-2 types of cheese which I try to switch up from week to week so there's variety (feta one week, goat cheese or blue cheese the next, etc..) I also always keep extra old cheddar on hand but will buy 3-4 blocks when on sale, and that lasts a month or two if kept well refridgerated). I also often buy ""snacky"" cheese items like string cheese, laughing cow cheese wedges or babybels.. it will depend if something is on sale or at a good price.   Deli and meat: Hummus from the deli section, although I switch up the flavours from week to week so I don't get bored. I also buy at least one kind of deli meat, although again I'll swap it up from one week to another for variety and depending what's on sale.. usually it's turkey of some kind, chicken or occasionally ham. I try to buy deli products without nitrates. I also buy bacon most weeks.. I can't eat a lot of it on a 1200 cal diet but a piece or two crumbled on a basic salad goes a long way to add flavour, plus my partner eats bacon. Additionally, I will usually buy 1-2 animal protein items (meat or seafood), which will be based on what's on sale. One week it might be chicken thighs and tilapia, another week it might be a pork tenderloin (which lasts like 3-4 meals in our house) and turkey sausage.   Bakery: whole grain bread (it's more for my partner because I rarely eat bread, but I'll occasionally have a slice), and then depending on what I'm thinking for meals for the week something like tortillas (whole wheat) or pitas too.   Produce: Every week I ALWAYS buy celery, carrots, bell peppers (red, orange, green, etc), bananas and usually around three types of lettuce/greens/salad base (so I mix it up between stuff like romaine, cabbage, baby spinach, spring mix, the bagged broccoli slaw etc) Additional fruits and veg are based on the flyer and what's on sale.. most weeks it's berries of some kind (blueberries, strawberries), at least one other kind of fruit that's on sale (might be pears, apples, mango, whatever) and 2-3 other fresh veggies depending on what's reasonably priced at the time (asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower). I also buy seasoning and herb type items like fresh garlic, fresh ginger, cilantro etc on a as needed basis. Oh and I tend to buy a new salad dressing almost every week.. I eat salads daily so between my partner and I we go through dressings pretty fast and I like having a few different ones on hand so I don't get bored. We mostly buy refridgerated dressings, not the lower quality shelf-stable ones. My favs are the Bolthouse Farm line of yogurt dressings, and Renee's brand.   Misc/Snacks: I usually buy some of kind of nut every week, depending on what's on sale. Almonds, cashews and pistachios are my favourite. I also buy kashi crackers most weeks. And diet pop (I know, I know.. the stuff isn't great for you but I like a diet coke or diet dr pepper as an afternoon pick me up on occasion.. I have a can maybe three times a week at the most so my habit isn't too bad).  On a less frequent basis aka once a month: I refresh my canned/dry goods around once a month or so, basically usually waiting until a costco trip with a family member who has a membership or until there's a good sale. This is stuff like canned beans/lentils, canned tuna and salmon, canned tomatoes, and so on. Dried goods are stuff like oats for oatmeal, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, couscous, quinona, peanut and almond butters, honey, etc. And I restock my freezer a bit maybe once a month or so too if I see a good sale.. I will buy freezeable shrimp at costco or on sale at the grocery store, and lots of frozen veggies such as the stir fry type blends (the plain unseasoned kind), frozen brussel sprouts and so on. And I like keeping a bag of frozen berries and a bag of frozen mangos on hand too, for smoothies or in case I run out of fresh fruit. I also don't buy butter more than once a month or so (if I buy 2-3 blocks when it goes on sale that's usually good for like two months), and oils, spices, sauces, stuff like that I refresh probably less frequently than once a month."
1200isplenty,38we5x,Ariadne89,3,Sun Jun 7 16:07:06 2015 UTC,"This was so in depth, thank you so much!   I really need to track down tilapia. I don't know whether it's uncommon in the UK or i've just never noticed it (since I only heard about it on this sub in the past week).   I'd definitely like to get a selection of salad dressings. At the moment I just have a bit of balsamic and lemon every time. Would be nice to change it up!"
1200isplenty,38we5x,dietbroccoli,4,Sun Jun 7 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm in Canada, tilapia is generally pretty cheap here... no idea if it's common in the UK though, sorry. It's typically a farmed fish so from an environmental perspective it's not the greatest seafood choice but I do buy it on occasion because it's cheap, fairly versatile and my partner will eat it (he's not a huge seafood person most of the time). It's low cal and pretty healthy but to be honest it's actually really band as far as fish goes.. that can be a plus if you want to use it in a recipe with a lot of strong seasonings/flavourings or a negative if you aren't someone who likes bland fish. I honestly prefer salmon, rainbrow trout or halibut a lot more than tilapia anyways, but all of those are usually more expensive so it really depends on where I'm at in the budget and what's on sale. We try to stick to around 200-300$ Canadian per month for groceries (so that's for two adults), but that's mostly the weekly shopping, we don't include like big costco stock-up trips where we buy like canned goods that will last us months in that budget."
1200isplenty,38we5x,Ariadne89,2,Sun Jun 7 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"You've made me realise that I really need to broaden my seafood horizons. I generally have salmon every 2/3 weeks and prawns every so often and finnan haddock even less than that... and ofc the obligitory British fish (cod) and chips every now and then. And sometimes a mixture of random fix in a fish pie.  Otherwise, I haven't really experimented!"
1200isplenty,38we5x,dietbroccoli,3,Sun Jun 7 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"May I ask which brand of cold cuts you get?  Nitrates trigger my headaches, so I'm very interested. Thanks"
1200isplenty,38we5x,Ariadne89,3,Sun Jun 7 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"Ahh that sucks! I'm in Canada.. so I'm not sure if any of these are available where you live but I usually get the President's Choice ""free-from"" line of products. There's a turkey, a ham and I think 1-2 other products in that line. The free-from means free from nitrates and antibiotics. It does have celery juice which is what is often used in ""natural"" products as an alternative to nitrates, I'm not sure if that would trigger anything from you. The PC one is slightly more affordable because it's a store brand, but you'll only find it at Loblaws or Real Canadain SuperStore (not sure if those exist in your area). Alternatively, I will buy the Maple Leaf Natural Selections deli meats whenever they go on sale.. they're nitrate free for sure. I think lilydale has a line of nitrate-free turkey/chicken as well, but I'm not 100% I haven't really bought it or looked at it in a while."

If you're into making stuff and have a food processor or blender, hummus is actually really easy and I find the homemade stuff is much better and cheaper than the store-bought hummus. Plus you can play with recipes and put different stuff in - I've made red bell pepper hummus with kale and all kinds of things."
1200isplenty,38we5x,anywayzz,3,Sun Jun 7 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"Do you have a favourite recipe? I actually have made hummus at home before but it possibly was the way I made it (canned chickpeas, garlic tahini, lemon, olive oil) but it just didn't have the same flavour/creaminess as the store bought ones that I like.. plus, I spent like 8$ on a jar of tahini which just sat in my fridge for months afterwards and then all the other ingredients cost money too.. whereas I can get hummus for 2-3$ without the fuss of having to make it myself and wash my blender. I don't know, I'm sure homemade is much better from a health perspective but I think my tastes have been more acclimatized to the store-made stuff lol.. plus the convenience and affordability. I get where you're coming from though, I do like to make things at home where possible and I cook most/many meals from scratch but I have a busy life so I do try to balance home-made with some convenience products like hummus that is ready to go. Same philosophy with salad dressings.. I can and occasionally do make vinaigrettes at home (especially for entertaining, or specials meals) but there are other times when I just want to have a salad dressing in the fridge that is ready to go."
1200isplenty,38we5x,tikislut,3,Sun Jun 7 23:46:23 2015 UTC,"Heya, I totally get ya. I have some things that I like and then some I just get store bought for convenience, even though homemade would probably be better. Salad dressings, mayo, etc. I think I eat hummus enough to make it worth it to make it at home - I eat it most days for lunch with veggies or as a spread on a wrap.   The big splurge is definitely the tahini. I have found other stuff to make with it - tahini grapefruit dressing with tamari and garlic over greens is great. I also make a edamame hummus with it which I love.   As far as recipes go, I've made it so much that I kind of just eyeball it, taste it and keep fiddling with it until its right. The basic recipe amounts I use are similar to what Jamie Oliver does with his, although I use less lemon.   http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/best-basic-hummus-recipe/#owB7YzDTDI9KekGX.97  I've found the trick to getting it super creamy is to add in some of the liquid from the can and then just process the everloving crap out of it and make sure it has plenty of olive oil. There's always a stage for me where I'm like ""is this good? no let me leave it in the processor for longer"" and then it comes together.   Anyway, thanks again for your shopping list! Cheers!"

This allows liquid and oil to drip down onto the sheet underneath rather than pooling around the potatoes so I find they become much crispier.   If that's not an option, make sure that you're not overcrowding your pan/baking sheet. You want a single layer where none of the sweet potato touches.

Sauté it with onions and crushed garlic until it's tender. I add soy sauce for flavor and too add moisture, but it's optional and not great for everyone because of sodium. Usually I fry up a piece or two of buckboard bacon as well (it's pork shoulder, much more meat, 2 slices is 40 calories, Applegate makes some) and chop it up and add it in too. And then at the end, make a hole in the middle, throw in a beaten egg and then scramble it all together.  Cauliflower is full of nutrients and fiber, so by adding protein you're getting one of the most concentrated healthy meals you can possibly get. Shrimp worked great (cook it before adding). On it's own it can actually be too low calorie for how filling it is, so extra protein is highly recommended, otherwise you're going to risk not hitting your minimums."

For breakfast I would suggest loading up on the ever-present hard boiled eggs with some fruit/salad. At dinner, they should provide you with a vegetarian protein option, so I'd just stick with that + salad and a little hummus. Even if you're not strictly calorie counting, you shouldn't really manage to go overboard with these choices! The food provided isn't particularly exciting, but it's generally really quite healthy.  As for lunch, they generally give you the chance to buy your own lunch. This will be falafel+pita 95% of the time. You can certainly bring your own snacks with you, so a good idea might be to bring some protein bars/trail mix/other non-refrigeratable snacks with you, and then mostly eat them for lunch. That way at least you'll know some of your intake is controlled!  Also, remember you're going to be walking and moving about A LOT. (I lost a couple pounds during those ten days without paying any attention to calories.) Birthright is exhausting. You really don't want to restrict too much - if you're hungry/tired/cranky all the time, it's really going to hinder your experience. Eat for energy, and remember what an incredible opportunity you're being given - so enjoy, and make the most of it!   Israeli food is also really great - if you get a chance, go to Mr. Shakshouka (sp?) if you stop for lunch in Jaffa. So, so, delicious!"
1200isplenty,38tl3v,damnoceanyouscary,9,Sat Jun 6 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"So glad to hear from someone who went! I'm really excited, especially since it's been 9 years since I was there. It didn't know they'd have a veggie protein besides falafel so that's a plus too. I'm going on a culinary specialized trip so I'm hoping there's a bit more variety but from what you're saying it sounds like I shouldn't have a problem. Thank you so much!"
1200isplenty,38tl3v,ohrejoyce,5,Sat Jun 6 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"I also went on birthright and ended up living in Israel for a year after!  I would not recommend bringing granola bars-- you are traveling halfway around the world! Enjoy the local pleasures! Produce is in abundance -- eat them! Pomegranates, dates, and pomelo, oh my! Eat the hummus!! It's delectable and not awful for you. Limit your pitas-- eat the falafel and shawarma on a bed of lettuce.   Above all, enjoy your trip! This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and your memories with be seasoned with the taste of the culture rather than protein bars ;)"
1200isplenty,38tl3v,damnoceanyouscary,4,Sat Jun 6 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with what you're saying, and I absolutely love Israeli food!   However, I did bring protein bars on my trip and I was really glad I did. My specific trip organizer actually didn't give us a lot of time to stop and buy the local food - we ended up grabbing sandwiches at a lot of malls on the way to other places. Personally, I try to be picky about what I put in my body 80% of the time so that I can enjoy the other 20% with abandon, and so knowing that I could rely on a protein bar to refuel when my only other option might be something deep fried was a big help. Also, I'm someone who likes to have constant access to snacks at odd hours!"
1200isplenty,38tl3v,sunrisesunbloom,10,Sun Jun 7 00:57:58 2015 UTC,"I just traveled internationally and didn't stick to any low calorie plan. I ate ramen, pastries, fried food, so much good (but high calorie) food everyday.  The first morning after I got back, I weighed in and had ""gained back"" almost 6 pounds! A few days later, I've shed most of the water weight and am now only 1.5 pounds higher than my pre-vacation weight.  So I guess what I'm saying is, make thoughtful choices--don't eat anything you don't really want to eat, treat yourself to local foods you can't get anywhere else, get full but don't get stuffed--and don't worry too much about it! You have to eat 3500 calories to gain a pound, which would be 500 calories over maintenance everyday for a week."
1200isplenty,38tl3v,I_am_quite_nervous,4,Sat Jun 6 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Just eat a smaller portion than served. I don't know if you keep kosher, though it isn't too hard when you are a vegetarian, but it is a great way to stay in good shape. In my experience, side dishes aren't too heavy if the main meal is meaty because of kosher laws. Avoid eating too many falafel.   Birthright is also very intensive. Tons of walking and dancing with suuuuuuuuper hot Israeli army guys. You'll be fine."
1200isplenty,38tl3v,akolada,4,Sat Jun 6 18:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'm Israeli and did birthright. Mine was several years ago but I'll go based off of what I remember for our meals.    The breakfasts they offer you are usually at a kibbutz.  This is an entire spread.  There's usually a bunch of rolls, breads and pitas with butters, white cheeses and jam/jelly.  Boiled eggs are plenty, as are olives and Israeli salad (cucumber, tomato, onion, parsley)  usually there is some kind of tuna salad in addition to other veggie type salads so there will definitely be veg friendly options available.  If you won't eat meat, I'd urge you to consider eating cheese because you're going to be on the go constantly and you'll need the extra calories because our breakfasts are not high cal at all.  There's usually  bunch of sugary juices and tons of coffee as well.  I think I recall American cereals too.    Lunch is the meal you buy yourself.  For you I'd recommend falafel.  It's fried and it has calories but usually the places they take you don't have much else available and you can't eat shawarma.  You'll probably burn most of that off anyway.  Not a big deal.  Sometimes sometimes the bus will make a stop at a center with a grocery store.  Stock up there! Israeli stores probably have all the stuff you buy in your country just different brands.   Dinner is usually meat in Israel.  Lots of fried schnitzels.  Beef is expensive here so they will usually feed you with chicken.  Clearly this doesn't help you.  There are lots of salads available.  Rolls again.  Maybe some roasted veggies.    I hope this gives you a better idea of what you have to work with.  I can't advise with portions but generally our food is a lot healthier than in America.  All the ingredients are usually fresh so there are less surprise calories.   You will have WiFi on the bus.  Continue using MFP if you have it and it reassures you.  Just estimate if you have to.    I don't think you'll have a problem staying under 1200, I just worry your restrictive diet might leave you hungry or in a deficit with all the walking and physical exertion."

Let cook for 5 to 10 minutes, then add chickpeas and 1 diced tomato. Let simmer for a few minutes, then add all the spices to taste (minus the saffron). I suggest being generous on the spices, that will give it the exotic taste. After another few minutes, pour enough water to completely cover the meat and let cook for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. After 1 hour, put in all the vegetables chopped in middle-sized chunks, add some more parsley and put in the saffron. Let cook for 20 minutes, or until you can pierce the vegetables easily with a fork.  Now, this is only the condiment. Unless you have a cous cous pot, you'll have to make the cous cous separetely, but it's really easy. Google will tell you all about it =)"

I went to my doctor who suggested a food allergy. My insurance refused to pay for an allergy test so I cut out everything not naturally occurring in foods (ex. Added sugar, salt, and spices)  After 3 weeks I added back one thing for a few days and repeated until the last thing I added was sugar, moderately because sugar is really sweet.  One day I bought a cup of sweet tea for lunch. Halfway through the cup I had a headache. I asked the manager for the ingredient list and found out that they make a pre-sweetened tea bag that had a combination of sugar and sweetener. I went back to water only for a few days. Then tried to drink a Freasca. It happened again. So on my return visit to the doctor's office we discussed it and have found the sensitivity as the only possible result. On a side note. Since finding this and preparing my own food at home two things have happened 1) I dislike eating out and 2) no more sinus infections."

I was afraid of slowing down further, but the scale wasn't moving anyway so I figured it couldn't hurt.

That day then becomes my ""cheat"" day. Life is inherently unpredictable, and you have to be able to adapt to that even when you're on a diet. For instance, if I'm nearing my 1200 calorie limit for the day, and my friend texts me that a bunch of friends are going out for dinner, I'm not going to say no and be a recluse for the night just because I'm trying to lose weight.

1200isplenty,38j2tn,blackforestblended,8,Fri Jun 5 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"I don't have cheat days, but I have what I consider to be ""cheat meals"", which typically only occur when I'm not in control of the coking (e.g. restaurant, dinner @ friend's, etc.) I still try to log everything and make low calorie choices, but I don't beat myself up over a larger portion of chicken or  bring a food scale or anything. To be honest, most of my cheat meals I don't even break 1800 calories, and most of the time it's from alcohol. Just having a bit of a ""cheat"" from religiously counting is enough to keep me sane, and I've never had an urge to binge myself full of junk.  I don't think the mentality of an entire cheat day is healthy, especially when I see people eating entire pizzas or multiple candy bars, simply because they ""can"" that day. It creates the mindset that you're depriving yourself every other day, and I find that does not yield long term results."
1200isplenty,38j2tn,Ariadne89,5,Thu Jun 4 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"I don't do ""cheat"" days, because my margins are too slim and because I seem to get used to sugar and large meals again easily and have terrible cravings the next day or two. I also hate the term, because I hate the sort of cutesy morality language that people often apply to food (especially in the UK for some reason, where the word ""naughty"" is horrible overused. Ugh.) Like, who or what are you cheating? Aren't you an adult who wants to do this for yourself?  I do definitely support people easing up occasionally though, obviously. Whatever works. For me, the two situations when I up my calories are when I think it will be worth it for a (probably social) special meal - then I'll try to make ok choices that won't leave me feeling gross (ie skip the bread basket), but I'll order the thing I actually want to eat, and then if I'm feeling cravey and constantly hungry and run-down (maybe it's PMS week or I've been ill), I'll have an intentional sort of re-feed meal where I'll have a 500cal panini or something for lunch instead of a 250cal salad, and try to sit and really enjoy it."
1200isplenty,38j2tn,Ariadne89,13,Thu Jun 4 19:04:54 2015 UTC,"Like you've already said, there are a lot of different and conflicting opinions out there on cheat days. I'm not going to condemn cheat days for everyone because I know some people have great arguments in favour of cheat days, that it keeps them sane and keeps them on their diet the other six days etc etc. My personal opinion though? I think a once a week cheat day is way too frequent for someone on 1200 cals who is trying to lose weight. I think an occasional cheat day/day when you can't obsessively count calories is okay and sometimes unavoidable, but I'm thinking more like once a month or less. Say thanksgiving, or the day you eat our for your birthday, or the day you attend a wedding or something like that. Basically holidays, special occasions which coincide with eating food that someone else has prepared and/or eating at restaurant, so that it could be hard to track exactly calories anyways.   Another more balanced alternative would be to consider an occasional cheat meal, rather than a whole cheat day. A cheat day implies a lot of overeating on calories throughout the day whereas a single cheat meal does less damage.. you might go over calories a bit but it's unlikely you can overeat by thousands of calories in a single sitting unless you're like a competitive eater or something.  Ultimately, you'll need to weigh the pros and cons of cheat days for yourself. If you believe in calories in versus calories out.. I think a lot of the ""sciency"" arguments around cheat days don't jive with a calories in, calories out philosophy. Bottom line would be that if you're eating more calories than you expend on your cheat day, you are hindering and slowing your weight loss. In my understanding, any arguments revolving around ""metabolism"" (ie. that cheat days hugely speed up your metabilism) are sketchy and unproven and unscientifice. People's metablisms don't tend to vary that significantly and any slowing down of the metablism due to dieting (ie on 1200 cals) is small and negligible anyways. All that said, there are psychological arguments in favour of cheat days in that some people says it keeps them sane and keeps them from bingeing all the time, so I'm not trying to negate those arguments. But it will be a personal choice if you can go without a lot of cheat days or not."
1200isplenty,38j2tn,throwfarfaraway3x,7,Thu Jun 4 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"Also.. I forgot to say. I don't know what the people you saw in the video were like but cheat days seem to be more effective for (and I don't mean this in a rude way), very large/obese men with much higher TDEEs than say a short woman dieting on 1200 cals. A man who is like 300 lbs can eat 2000 calories a day and still lose weight. That man also burns way more calories via exercise than someone under 200 lbs. So let's say.. if that man overeats by another 1000 calories on his ""cheat day,"" meaning he ate 3000 calories for the day in total. It's not necessarily going to be THAT much of a hinderance to his weight loss, especially if he throws in some exercise. He would have to over eat by 3500 calories to gain a lb (excluding issues of sodium and water weight), so basically as long as he didn't eat like 5500 calories in a day he would probably either maintain or still lose weight. Let's look at a much smaller woman. Say a female around 170 lbs, who wants to get down to 130. Not factoring in exercise, her tdee is probably around 1700-1800. When she diets at 1200 calories, her caloric defecit is only about 500 calories per day. Yeah, she can increase the defecit with exercise of course but even still, at a defecit of around 500 calories per day, it will take her a week to lose a lb, again ignoring stuff like muscle and water weight. If that female has a cheat day where she overeats by say 1000 calories, going well above her TDEE.. well she just completely erased two days of calorie defecit, meaning two days of dieting at 1200 calories were pretty much for nothing. That could seriously slow her weight loss for the week."
1200isplenty,38j2tn,winniemanos,3,Thu Jun 4 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Good points - thank you! Some of the videos/articles I've stumbled upon (and I wish I can find at the moment, I'll post once I do) also suggested that you ""fast"" the day after a cheat day. Perhaps you hit 2500 on a cheat day, but then 'fast' at 500 calories the next day. Again, something about ""increase fat-burning metabolism"".   Personally, that would be a heck of a struggle, but I suppose that cancels out the calories at the end of the day."

I drink one cuo of black coffee in the morning, not too concerned about those 5 calories. I also drink green tea and some herbal teas like peppermint but I don't sweeten them or anything so don't usually count. I also don't typically enter salt, pepper or spices. Someone mentioned here that spices have calories and we should enter them, and I think someone here enters even salt and pepper but just my opinion I find that a tad overkill.

I understand it's trivial for some, but I regularly use 5+ packets of splenda a day, drink lots of powerade zero, diet soda, etc. My zero calorie foods can amount to an extra 100 cals a day depending on how much I eat. I know a big dill pickle (Klausen's) is around 20 calories. I wouldn't stress about logging if you don't eat a lot of ""zero cal"" food regularly, but if you eat a lot of it like me it can add up. I'll often just log Crystal light as a shortcut for foods like this. It's 2 carbs, 10 cals. Pretty consistent with the stats for most low cal sweeteners/drinks/etc. For bigger things like baking, I would definitely recommend adding the calories from Splenda, since you use about 50+ ""servings"". I wish they'd make a law about mislabeling. It's super misleading since they know many people assume multiples of zero are zero. You could call anything zero cal if you make the serving size small enough (like Pam or baking Splenda where it's like 600+ servings/container). Sorry, kind of went on a rant! :P"

Overall I thought it was fairly good but most of the stuff said was not revolutionary... basically Americans eat way too much sugar and way too many carbs, over-eat on portions sizes in general + children are more inactive. The diet industry has falsely placed too emphasis on ""low fat"" foods when fat is not the enemy. And too much emphasis on exercise, when you can't out run your fork.   I felt bad for the children in the movie because they're just kids, and because they did really want to lose weight and were ""trying"" or at least thought they were trying but they and their families just didn't have the knowledge. Like the mom who mentioned that she buys lean pockets instead of regular hot pockets or whatever.. it's still processed food, so is the cereal and the granola bars and stuff the kids were shown eating yet the family perceives it as a healthier choice. Advertising is crap and so confusing and just so much white noise when it comes to weight loss and food and what is healthy, there's just so much information over load.   A lot of us like to think we are somehow ""above advertising"" but many of us aren't. I remember when I was younger in college, I used to buy a crap ton of Special K products... all of their cereals and bars and snack packages and crap. I had low self-esteem, I saw their advertising and tv and just thought oh ""special K is a healthy choice, it's for women trying to watch their weight, it will keep me thin blah blah."" I remember the day I went shopping with a kind friend who very gently had me look at the special k label. It contained high fructose corn syrup! And had nearly as many grams of sugar as something like Sugar Crisp cereal, even though it was ""low fat."" That was a huge wake up moment for me, I came to realize Special K wasn't really ""healthy"" or ""natural"" and I had been just going along with the advertising without really questioning things. I felt like a fool but it really taught me something. I did some research on cereal and switched to plain oatmeal, and never bought a Special K product again (last time I checked.. they still had a lot of sugar. BTW unrelated tangent.. Special K advertising often literally offends me now.. they act like all women even the super skinny pretty ones shown in the commercials need to constantly lose weight and diet.. soo annoying and sexist.   Anyways, I will also say that I do think the documentary didn't quite strike the right balance between personal responsibility versus government though. I'm not American but from this type of stuff I do agree there are huge problems with the way the government handles the obesity problem.. letting companies lobby and add high fructose corn syrup into everything, failing to really educate well in schools, letting companies blatantly advertise junk to children, their crappy ""food pyramid"" recommending 5 servings of grain or whatever, and so on... there's like 50 other things the gov is doing wrong. But there's lots of ways to educate yourself for anyone with a public library (free in most of America, no?), an internet connection, or even just with the literacy to read a label at the store. I grew up in a family who ate a fair bit of processed food and wasn't hugely educated on nutrition. My family's idea of healthy was whole wheat pasta, but the pasta would still be loaded with cheese, high-calorie sauce and meatballs and the portion size would be out of control. But I'm an adult, I can take responsibility in my own hands to learn about nutrition and appropriate portions. I realize not everyone has a computer, or access to great grocery stores (yeah I know about food deserts), or a lot of money.. and for those people I agree that being overweight is completely tangled up in their povery and a very complicated social class issue. But lots of more middle class people are obese too, and I think those people have less excuse to not take some responsibility for educating themselves, it's not all about the government. Anyways those are often the same people who are quick to scream ""nanny state"" if there is a law that forbids the sale of soda or something."

1200isplenty,38iz4w,annpann,5,Thu Jun 4 23:19:53 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I do agree with you that a lot of people need it, it's partly like I said, there's just soo much white noise there about what foods are/aren't healthy, products, fat versus carbs, keto versus calorie counting versus paleo and on and on. I do think some of the more basic stuff is fairly common knowledge.. not the stuff about lobbying and diet industry but basic stuff such as the fact that most of us eat too much sugar, portions that are too large and are too sedentary. I think most people know those kinds of things deep down, because it's in the media all the time, on the news etc. It's just that people like to think it doesn't apply to them, or they eat healthy, or their portions aren't that bad or whatever. I like the show Secret Eaters for that.. so many of the people on that show aren't trying to be unhealthy (at least not in their view) and do want to lose weight, they just honestly don't get that their portions are out of whack and that they have to count everything that goes in their mouths, including snacks, beverages, etc.   The exercise thing is something I've encounted with some of my family/friends too. They're like, ""you run, you go to the gym, you can pizza and ice cream."" I've tried to tell them many times that although exercise is VERY good for you both physically and mentally, it's not a magic cure for over-eating. If you're over-eating constantly exercise is not going to be enough for that. I've tried to tell them many times that weight loss is like 80% diet (ie. eating under your calorie limit) and only 20% exercise but they think I'm totally wrong and that you lose weight by sweating at the gym for hours. So yeah, even some of my own family and friends have fallen for that aspect of advertising and lobbying, where it's made to see like food is not the problem but rather if we just exercised a bit more we'd all be skinny. But exercise is not going to fix thosuands of calories of over-eating."

I've massively got it under control by finding salt and vinegar rice cakes (so savoury, 'crispy' snacks). Snack a jacks if you're in the UK although they may be available elsewhere, and I believe there is a bbq flavour and a sour cream and onion? But the s+v is just 80 calories for two which adds up to a great snack.  And I may be going against the grain here but no, my cravings for crisps have not gone away, 6 months in. I had a packet yesterday. But, they were 200cal and I made it work in my calorie budget. The trick is I don't have them at home to snack on, and instead of saying 'oh well I'll just pop to the shop for some' I grab a rice cake or two and move on. It works maybe 6/7 days."

I have a dog and a shop quite near so I go, ""Oh, I'll just take the doggy for a stroll, move a bit and get something snacky,"" it's such crap logic, I need to start walking my dog in the other direction..."

Hmm, well I always find unflavoured rice cakes or crackers a bit bland, but maybe you could get some rice cakes and have them with cream cheese and maybe even some spices? Riveta could work too if you have it where you are - it's like a crisp wholegrain cracker type thing. But you can doll that stuff up with whatever flavour suits you!  I also needed to replace the repetitive munching action that you get from crisps, which the rice cakes and such don't satisfy - they just satisfy the savoury flavour craving. So I've got frozen berries and I'll just sit with a bowl of them.  Hope that helps! Take the doggy for a hike away from shops next time ;)"
1200isplenty,38ht9n,alcuin89,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"I've done 1,200 on and off for several years now and my cravings for chips (crisps) never diminished. I can clear a family sized bag of salt and vinegar chips with ease, albeit at the expense of the roof of my mouth. Ouch.  The way I combat my chips cravings is to buy the popped version of chips. In the US we have Popchips, but I'll also buy popped crackers like Wheat Thins Popped. If they have those at your supermarket, it's always worth considering.   As for Trader Joe's, I don't think you need it. The pre-made stuff everyone raves about can be easily made at home for way cheaper (depending on the cost of your local produce). For example, to make the guacamole, just add in fat free sour cream or Greek yogurt to get the same creamy consistency.   Also, Bethanny Frankel (famous for her skinny girl brand and is a reality star) has a series of videos on YouTube where she gives clever recipe advice. It's worth looking into. I love her version of guacamole. Her videos are also very motivating because she used to be chubby and found something that worked for her."

1200isplenty,38h7n6,ohrejoyce,2,Thu Jun 4 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"Recipe adapted from this blog -- serves 2-3 large portions:  Ingredients:   2 medium zucchini  2 Tablespoons (30ml) olive oil  1/2 pound (225g) peeled and de-veined shrimp  3 large cloves garlic, minced or crushed 1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and sliced thin 3 green onions, sliced in 1"" pieces 1 large egg 2 cups (480ml) bean sprouts 1/3 cup (80ml) roasted peanuts cilantro (optional)   For the Sauce:   2 Tablespoons (30ml) rice vinegar or distilled white vinegar 2 Tablespoons (30ml) fish sauce (or more to taste) 3 Tablespoons (45ml) ketchup 1 teaspoon (5ml) brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon chili garlic sauce (or more to taste)   Directions: Make the Sauce: in a small bowl, combine the sauce ingredients (vinegar, fish sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, and chili garlic sauce), set aside.  1.) Cut the zucchini into noodles or long pasta by using a vegetable spiralizer tool or tools mentioned in our post write up.  2.) Heat a large pan on medium-high heat. Add one tablespoon of olive oil (reserve the other half for later). Then add zucchini noodles and cook for about 2-3 minutes or until the zucchini noodles are tender. Don't overcook the noodles. The zucchini noodles should be slightly crunchy with a tender bite.   3.)Let the noodles rest for about 3 minutes to allow all the moisture to release. Remove the noodles from the pan and drain the excess water.  4.) Carefully wipe the same pan remove the excess water, then re-heat the pan on medium-high heat. Add the remaining olive oil and garlic. Cook the garlic until soft and translucent, about 1 minute. Add the shrimp and cook until shrimp is tender and becomes pink, 3-4 minutes.  5.) Add the bell peppers and green onions. Cook for about 1-2 minutes or until tender. Add the egg and stir in with the vegetables until the egg is cooked.  6.) Add the zucchini noodles back into the same pan, then add the sauce. Cook for about 1 more minute or until the zucchini noodles are heated through. Then stir in the bean sprouts.  7.) Serve the warm zucchini pad thai noodles with roasted peanuts and cilantro.  Changes I made -- I used 3 Zucchinis, 1.5 tbsp oil, no bell peppers (allergy), soy sauce instead of fish sauce (didn't have any), 22g of peanuts (fewer than is in recipe) and no cilantro."

1200isplenty,389hzs,noir-,3,Tue Jun 2 23:30:15 2015 UTC,"Just to ask - do you cook the pasta ahead of time as a big batch or just when you're prepping each bowl? And if ahead of time, how long is it ok to keep cooked pasta in a fridge before it can't really be eaten anymore?"
1200isplenty,389hzs,noir-,4,Wed Jun 3 11:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I cook the pasta in a big batch.  To make sure the calorie count is accurate, I measure out 2 oz of dry pasta times the amount of days I am making my lunch ahead of time.  For instance I made 4 days worth of this so I measured out 8 oz of dry pasta.  Then after it's cooked I weigh it again and divide that number by 4, and separate whatever number that is into the separate tupperware containers.  I hope that makes sense, haha.  I've had no problem making batches of this on Sunday and the pasta stays flavorful and moist by Friday.  Drizzling a small amount of oil on it helps keep it moist and prevents it from sticking together."
1200isplenty,389hzs,ShittyDuckFace,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:22:46 2015 UTC,Aaaah perfect! Do you drizzle the oil on the day of eating or once you've made it/separated it?
1200isplenty,389hzs,ShittyDuckFace,2,Wed Jun 3 13:25:56 2015 UTC,"I separate the pasta into the individual containers (it's the last ingredient to go in) then drizzle the oil in each one.  That way the oil measurement is more accurate.   Edit:  I should say that I add the oil at the same time I'm prepping it all, not on the day I'm eating it.  So it's basically just grab and go!"

1200isplenty,387h5i,ReilaReborn,8,Tue Jun 2 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"I've never seen riced cauliflower at Target but that would be great! Ricing cauliflower isn't necessarily a difficult, but it can take time that you don't always have and I also know there's a lot of college kids on this sub that might not have the appliances. Personally, if I'm cooking for one I don't have a large enough portion to justify ricing an entire head of cauliflower and cooking it because it'll go bad before I can eat it all. But since Trader Joe's is a little more expensive, what are some of your favorite finds at Target?"

Making huge batches of food and then weighing and separating everything into containers for my meals through the week  I've found pb2 at target, 45 calorie bread, sandwich thins, seasonings and oils that weren't being sold at my local grocer.

Also, I get bored really easily doing the same meal so many days in a row. I'm not personally a fan of PB2 because it has added sugar but I've heard that Costco (I think) has powdered peanuts without it so I've been meaning to try that. Can I ask what your normal grocer is?

Steamed broccoli, sauteed some kale and garlic, and baked a sweet potato in the microwave. It was so satisfying to have all the colors on my plate and I seriously was so full.

Seal then squish to evenly coat and then place in the refrigerator to marinate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, combine remaining 1/4 cup soy sauce or Tamari and remaining 1 Tablespoon cornstarch with chicken broth, orange juice, rice vinegar, sugar, orange zest, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and red chili pepper flakes then set aside.  Heat a large wok or nonstick skillet over high heat then add broccoli and water. Stir fry until broccoli is crisp tender, 3-4 minutes then remove to a plate and set aside.  Heat oil in wok then add half the marinated beef in one layer. Do not disturb for 30 seconds, or until bottom is golden brown. Flip slices then saute until second side is golden brown. This should go very quickly if your beef is cut thin enough. Also, don't overcook the beef or it can turn tough. Remove to a plate then cook remaining beef and then add to plate.  Add the sauce to the wok then cook until thickened and reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cooked beef and broccoli back into the wok then scoop over cooked rice when warmed through."

1200isplenty,386o0v,YayBudgets,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:18:32 2015 UTC,I think the MFP weight training tracker is just to keep track of reps/weight lifted and progress.   The estimate WILL be lower if you do find the calories burned estimates in the cardio section.   Strength training is not cardio and therefore you do not increase your heart rate to a level that will burn the calories that cardio exercises do.

Bratwurst: 100 calorie bun (the cheap ones), a bratwurst (~200), top with chopped onions, chopped jalapenos and deli mustard.. mmmm.  Chili with rice: Make chili using a mix of diced onions/garlic, lean ground meat (or meatless, which is what I usually do), beans of choice (black and kidney and 'chili beans' are normal), diced tomatoes in a can and spices (chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper). Cook it all until it's delicious. Top ~150-200 calories worth of plain rice with a scoop of chili (200) and eat. Sprinkle cheese on top if that's your thing. You could also throw the chili on top of steamed veggies and it will be delicious.  Tacos: Corn tortillas (3 for 120ish, give or take, depends on the size), shredded chicken with spices, a sprinkle of black beans, top with a blend of cilantro and red onion diced small, pico de gallo, and some extra salsa if you'd like. You'll likely have extra calories with this so enjoy some chips with salsa on the side, or throw some guac on top of your tacos (both if it's low-cal enough!)"

Typically if I TELL him something is healthy, he already comes to the table with a preconceived idea of how something is going to taste. Try lightening up a recipe of something you know he likes (turkey burgers, flat bread pizza, sweet potato fries) and experiment from there.  One thing I have gotten him into doing that you can benefit from is GRILLING! You can make tons of healthy vegetable dishes as well as different types of meat with ease. You can encourage him to try new marinades, different cuts and types of meat, and different rubs. Guys love being the Grillmaster and cooking with fire! Maybe having a bit of ""buy in"" in the process will help him be supportive too. Also, you can make some healthy sides inside while he isn't looking ;) If you don't have a grill, a cast iron pan on the stove/oven lends a similar flavor."

There are options once you've committed to low cal options, but they're just a little bit sad to pizza monsters.  A good eye-opener is bananas ice cream.  You can also just grab a bag of frozen roasted bell peppers, a jar of Bertolli alfredo sauce, zoodle some zucchini, a portion of spaghetti, (half-zoodle, half-noodle) then cook it all up.  It's not too hard to get a big bowl of that under 500 kcal at 1 serving per ingredient and it's delicious if you like cream sauces.  It'd probably work with vodka sauce.  Probably not with straight up tomato sauce.  Bananas Ice Cream  For this recipe you just need bananas and a really good blender (0.5 hp and up; e.g., a Vitamix).   Get some really ripe bananas—spotty and super sweet but not turning transparent and gross.  Freeze them for at least 6 hours.  To freeze, just peel, chop into quarters, stick them in a sandwich bag, then throw them in the freezer (keeps for 5-7 days). Stick the bananas in your blender and blend until smooth; tamper required.  4 bananas should give you about 400-450 grams and you'll probably lose about 30-50 grams in the blender (perfect for sundaes for two).  Feel free to add ½ tsp pumpkin pie spice, extracts, or anything else you like, but try it plain first.   It's extremely delicious and 178 kcal for 200 g (2 bananas).  Add some sugar-free chocolate syrup for another 100 kcal.  I usually gag on sugar-free syrups but the bananas seem to neutralize whatever bitter vileness I usually taste in sugar-free syrups."

Turkey pepperoni if he can handle it, or Sabatinos chicken meatballs from Costco. Switch it up with a lower cal BBQ sauce and diced chicken breast. Get nuts with a breakfast pizza. Mix one egg with some egg whites or Egg Beaters, scramble. Throw on the pizza with some crumbled bacon - Oscar Mayer center cut is 60 cals for 3 slices. Plenty for a pizza.       Look for the Moran's brand of extra lean ground beef to make burgers. Gonna be lower cals than a lean turkey burger. Top with Kraft 2% American cheese to get the real fast food cheese ooze for less cals. Get store brand basic buns for the lowest cals, around 110. How about a hot dog? Ball Park Lean Beef Franks are ridiculous right off the grill and only 80 cals each.   Get Jimmy Dean Delights breakfast sandwiches. Toss the box so he doesn't see it's turkey sausage.

Dough  1 pouch (or one TBS dry yeast)  1 tsp salt  2-3 cups of flour  1 cup of warm water  Directions - knead together ingredients. Make sure the water is luke warm. If it's too hot you will kill your yeast. The flower ratio is different because it will depend on the humidity of where you live. You want it moist enough to have it all stick together with no excess flour, but not so sticky that it sticks to your hands. Knead well. Remember, it's easier to add flour than have to add more water, so knead in flour in small amounts until it's right.

Roll them out thin (on a lightly floured surface), but not so thin you would get a hole if you plan to make the pockets.

Trick he taught me: add hot water to the thermos for a minute or two to warm it up before adding your hot food.

If you feel good, look good, and can build muscle, then 1200 is enough."

When I eat less healthily, I have to eat more total calories to hit my macros - which is fine, really, if you aren't seeking to lose weight. Opinions differ on this, but for me it's macros above all else. I need that 100g of protein if I want my body to meet the demands of the day. If I have a large French Fries or three cocktails or whatever, then fuck it, I've got to go over to get that protein in. Other people's bodies are similarly fussy about carbs or fats."

After five minutes add the petit pois and mange tout. Boil together for five more minutes  Drain vegetables, reserving a little cooking water Mix the grated or chopped cheese, squeezed lemon juice plus pulp and crushed peppercorns into the vegetables (I like it mushy)  Take the potatoes out and serve!

If a low-calorie diet, or at least lower than a person's maintenance needs, is used for a long period of time, they lose weight. When most of the ""weight"" is lost, it begins to eat up muscle fibers, the fat-layers of the brain, and your body systems begin to shut down.

You can do tons of variation on this--brown lentils with Italian seasoning and yellow lentils with curry seasoning. It works out to about $1 per serving, which is great.  I eat oatmeal in the mornings for breakfast. Add a tablespoon of peanut butter, and you have a great breakfast for ~$0.30.

I also like the vibrating silent alarm, though sometimes I have to use an audible back-up alarm.  While it doesn't give me numbers as precise as the HR model would, I've used it since January to successfully maintain and lose by eating either at or just below the calorie total it gives me.  I have MFP linked to Fitbit, so my food journal and steps are put into both apps, which gives me a nice, complete picture of what each day's intake vs. output looks like.  Fitbit has an iphone app and free desktop software for Windows and iOS.  I've never had any trouble with any of the Fitbit software for Windows and Android, and it looks like their ratings for Apple software are about the same as for non-Apple software."

I whisked three eggs, diced tomato, salt and pepper, and then put that in the pan. The Laughing Cow is kind of sticky when you dice it, but if you freeze it for a few minutes it helps -- I chopped that really finely and sprinkled it on top, then threw a slice of ultra-thin cheese and popped the entire pan into the oven (400F) for five minutes.

1200isplenty,37mfl3,Ariadne89,44,Thu May 28 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who finds this kind of thing really basic? I think most of us already know that a) the Big Mac is not a very healthy choice/pretty high in calories and b) that you can eat a lot more bulk if your meal is stuff like veggies, whole grains and lean proteins. The problem for many people is not the knowledge that the Big Mac is unhealthy (pretty much anyone who grew up after or around the time Super Size Me was released has this ingrained in them) but rather resisting the craving for salt/fat by finding other meal ideas that flavourful, delicious and healthier. Also, your pasta looks super bland, boring and unseasoned? Normally I wouldn't say something like that on posts but if you're going to hold your meal up as some kind of ideal.. you could go for a better pasta dish than plain macaroni with a few spinach leaves on top. I'm not sure how plain macaronic is necessarily going to appeal to someone desperately craving a big mac. A better comparison would be something like grilled chicken on whole grain bun, or healthy bean burger, or a portabella mushroom cap burger etc.. the calories in that kind of dish versus Big Mac."

1200isplenty,37mfl3,atlccw,17,Thu May 28 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! Sorry, I didn't mean to be so negative it just seemed a bit random to compare a big mac (beef and cheese) with something completely unsimilar like asparagus, noodles and chicken or fish (not sure which it is) as they don't even have any ingredients in common... I mean, yeah your meal is much healthier but they're so unsimilar it doesn't seem that fair to compare in a way. Like I could compare a slice of cheesecake and say it has the same calories as salmon, steamed broccoli and brown rice but I think we all already know the salmon plate is healthier than the cheesecake. The kind of comparisons I think are more useful are where people take an unhealthy item and remodel it to be healthier.. like I said, to compare a big mac with a healthier burger such as a chicken burger, or vegetatian black bean patty etc.  Anyways, congrats on working on your cooking skills! Honestly, you'll easily improve with time and the internet is your friend.. there's recipes and techniques and youtube videos for literally everything nowadays. I started from scratch with cooking 6-7 years ago too when I first lived on my own, and I pretty much learned from the internet, a few really basic cookbooks and trial and error. And now I'm confident enough to host dinner parties. And hey if you like chicken breast take a look at this link: http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-moist-tender-chicken-breasts-every-time-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-36891.

1200isplenty,37mfl3,Ariadne89,7,Thu May 28 23:19:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the similarities thing. I would like to see more ""this vs. that"" that are actually relevant -- like a slice of pizza from dominos vs. a lightened up version, a Big Mac with a healthy spin on a traditional cheese burger, etc. It's easy to put a Snickers next to twenty five brussel sprouts -- let's challenge ourselves to make relevant comparisions!"
1200isplenty,37mfl3,lessadessa,3,Fri May 29 14:46:45 2015 UTC,"Not in any way saying it's a great movie or super scientific or anything.. but it received a LOT of press and attention at least in North America and the point I'm making is that the many of the generations who grew up around the time it was released tend to be hyper-aware of the fact that McDonald's food is extremely unhealthy. Ever since Super Size Me, McDOnalds big macs have become sort of the sterotype of unhealthy fat food. So all I was saying is that I think most of us already know that big macs aren't some beacon of health.. people aren't eating them and deluding themselves into thinking it's any way healthy. People eat them because of the convenience, the (relatively) affordable price, the salt and fat content (addictive flavours that people crave) and due to a lack of cooking skills or a lack of a way to make healthier food flavourable and tasty.  Fat Head is basically promoting anti-carb/gluten-free no? Or am I  mixing it up with somethine else? I've seen a book with the same name and it was for a low-carb diet."

1200isplenty,37n5n7,Luxray,3,Thu May 28 22:50:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah exercise shouldn't add too much. Let's say you do two miles a day 4 times a week. At 100 calories a mile (which is probably overestimating unless you're over 200lbs) you'll only loose 800 calories a week, which is still only about a pound a month. Treadmill calories burned and most other machine calculators in the gym are garbage because they include your bmr for some reason."

Takes me about 20 minutes from start to finish.  Once you get into that habit, it's easier. When you're just throwing something together real quick, you might not choose the healthiest option. Having something already made that you know is what you need helps. At least, it helps me.  Allow yourself one cheat meal per week. ONE. Not that your prepped meals have to suck, but you're going to crave unhealthy food, especially if you're accustomed to eating it often. If you stick it out with your meal prep, after 2-3 weeks, you'll find your cravings don't affect you as much (especially when you imagine the final result of sticking it out).  There's also a general feeling of being healthier that I've notice. It's not subtle. You feel lighter and less sluggish.  Just keep chugging, and if you have a mishap, don't snowball back into old habits. Chide yourself, and get back on track."

Read the stuff on sidebar on /r/keto. They say don't worry about calories when you're first starting, but yes, you do need to count calories. It's easier staying full on keto, so I found myself less prone to snaking and grazing because of the amount of fat and protein I was eating."
1200isplenty,37o83i,whitehouses,11,Fri May 29 14:53:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, well it's more that calories still matter on keto. Keto is very satiating, but it's very easy to gain weight on it because fats are so high calorie. My calorie limit is 1000-1200 a day and I can blow through that by eating some peanut butter and an avocado no problem."

What's your height, weight, how much have you lost, what types of foods are you eating, how long have you been calorie counting? You just need to do what works for you. Some people combine calorie counting and keto. High carb or low carb, over eating makes you not lose weight.  I think there's a /r/1200isplentyketo sub."
1200isplenty,37o83i,buttburglar,5,Fri May 29 02:31:45 2015 UTC,I'm 5'2. I was 145lbs when I started 3 years ago. I'm now 116. Was hoping to get down to 105. I'm apprehensive about starting keto because rice is a staple food in my family and I'm not sure if I can sustain a low carb diet. I heard that rebound weight gain is a thing for people who aren't able to keep up with the diet. But if it's going to help me reach my goals then maybe it's worth a try.
1200isplenty,37o83i,Jenjenmi,3,Fri May 29 02:41:00 2015 UTC,Are you exercising at all? Maybe you could add in hiit 3x a week to burn off some fat. I think keto works better for people with higher fat %.
1200isplenty,37o83i,anbeav,3,Fri May 29 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'd wonder if strength training could help too. Sounds like you're trying to get those last few pounds off and that can be tough.  Do you watch your macros? Maybe 1200 could work if you went for more protein and less carbs without going all the way to keto.  I can't do keto, it's too far removed from how I want to eat. Not enough of a meat eater and I enjoy fruit too much for it."

1200isplenty,37o83i,Chef1987,2,Fri May 29 13:52:45 2015 UTC,Keto and counting calories are not mutually exclusive. People who return to old habits regain the weight like any diet

At a place like this, most sides are likely cooked in large batches, and they will probably be unable to accommodate your request.   You shouldn't need to deviate from the menu, anyway. Rabbit is very lean, as are the unfried fish and chicken. For your sides, go with the beets, brussels, green beans, broccoli, or greens. Drink water. Also, keep in mind that these are probably not normal portions. Take half home and have it for lunch tomorrow. Have fun!"

One of the fish options (not the fried catfish) or the roast chicken would probably be your best bet.  The pork tenderloin or grilled porkchop might also be good options.  As far as sides go, the lowest calorie ones on there are going to be the roasted beets, broccoli, braised greens, brussels sprouts.  Corn isn't a terrible option but it has more calories than you think and it'll probably have a lot of butter.  So would the broccoli and brussels sprouts, though.  Greens and green beans traditionally don't have much added to them except some salt pork, ham hock, or hog jaw to add a little flavor.  It's also traditional to eat greens with vinegar but you add that yourself.  You wouldn't really add a ton of extras to the beets either except maybe a little oil for the roasting."

1200isplenty,37m5lw,coffeecupschooner,4,Thu May 28 18:28:17 2015 UTC,I also think you should work on portion control as much as picking the right foods. Maybe you can ask for a small plate or bowl and just put the food you want to eat on that plate? Or split your meal with someone? Then eat slowly and try to recognize when you are full. Good luck!

For the sides my picks would be broccoli (with no butter) and either Braised greens or brussels sprouts. You can tell the server you either don't eat dairy or are allergic to it so they will hopefully stay clear of butter. Also, ask if they have any steamed veggies or if it can be done. Many restaurants are used to people asking for side swaps so it's possible they have some just in case."

Like others are saying, sugars from fruit, ect aren't really something you need to super worry about health-wise.      What you do need to look at is how your body converts food to energy/building blocks for your body. Carbs tend to give a spike then drop in energy, making you more likely to get in a cycle of repeatedly eating too many carbs. Protein and fat give you longer lasting energy, and you need to make sure you're getting enough of them for things like brain and muscle health. This is kinda just scratching the surface, but that's the general gist of things.      If you're not getting enough of other nutrients because you're using all of your calories on sugars, then I might look into trying to eat more balanced, but you're probably fine."

The problem I have is that the brand of bacon I usually buy has a nutrition label that gives calories for ""two strips uncooked,"" and it's something like 230 calories. It's just regular thin cut bacon, not thick cut. Now, obviously bacon is high in fat regardless but if you cook it fairly crispy a lot of the fat and grease falls out of it (and I also dab it well between paper towels to wipe away more grease) so it seems like the calories for uncooked versus cooked would be pretty different. When I google around it seems like average bacon (although it depends on the thickness) is more like 60-70 calories per slice, once cooked. So I don't know whether to be on the safe side and go with what it says on the label of the bacon I buy or to assume that the calories are lower once cooked.."
1200isplenty,37g232,Ariadne89,7,Wed May 27 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"I'm really not sure, I just go by the packaging. The bacon I use is pretty thin, and it gives the nutrition for 3 pan fried slices as the serving size at 70 cals. It's verified on MFP, so I guess it's true, although it does seem low. I also drain the grease after I cook it though. The brand is Hatfield, if that helps!"

1200isplenty,37g232,Ariadne89,2,Wed May 27 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well I'm pretty sure it's because it's giving the calories for uncooked slices. It specifically says ""2 slices uncooked (50 g)."" The thing is, when you weigh the bacon after it's cooked it's like maybe 8 grams per slice, so maybe 16 for two slices. That's not even approaching the 50 grams uncooked. I really like the brand, it's a store brand so it's usually a bit cheaper, it's low-salt bacon which is good, naturally smoked with no preservatives or chemicals and most importantly I prefer the flavour over some other bacons I've bought before.. some bacon has that blah nitrate smell/flavour whereas this one is just delicious. Not a huge fan of Oscar Meyer products in the past (too many preservatives and all their products seemed to have nitrites/nitrates) but to be fair, I haven't tried them in a long time. But it does bother me not having a good sense of how many calories are actually in it, so yeah I might try some other brands."
1200isplenty,37g232,Ariadne89,1 point,Wed May 27 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"I would just divide the weight of your cooked bacon by the weight of the serving size and multiply by calories.

A little goes a long way.. you don't really need a lot for a piece of toast or to add a bit of flavour to veggies or whatever. I find I don't even need a whole tablespoon. Use a digital scale and you be careful about exactly how many grams you're using. Hope this doesn't sound preachy but unless you're vegan, I don't see the issue with butter and I think it's often unfairly demonized. It's perfectly healthy consumed in moderation and your body does in fact need some saturated fats, it's a natural food that our ancestors (well mine.. depends on what region you're from) have been making and consuming for hundreds and hundreds of years. Margarine and I can't believe it's not butter and ""buttery spread,"" olive oil spread like Becel etc etc.. yeah they have their place if you're vegan or can't eat dairy so for sure they're a good option for those people but they're not really ""natural"" products, they're created by hydrogenating oil (not a natural process the way churning butter is). So just my opinion and I know there are others opinions out there but I'd just try to slot yourself in a teaspoon or two of butter now and then, if you want it. I find I don't need a full tablespoon. Fat is very satisfying and satiating so if anything a bit of real butter now and then can prevent bingeing or going off your calorie count."

Then, you can eat back up to half of your calories burned (assuming you'd still get the deficit you need to lose) - common theory is that MFP over-estimates calories burned with exercise.    I've found success in getting a heart-rate/calorie monitor (I use the Charge HR) and letting that estimate my daily burned calories for me based on my heart rate rather than inputting activities. The reason I go by heart-rate is because I believe (not sure if true) that the fitter you get, the less calories you burn with the same level/intensity of exercise, so I think going by heart-rate is more accurate than MFP's standard assumptions."

But keep in mind that the formula version of these medicines aren't actually supposed to be taken by everyone, every time they have a cold. (All of these meds are available in pill form.) There is a purpose for the sugar being in there; it's not just there for funsies. It makes it easier to take medication on an empty stomach if it's going down with ""a spoon full of sugar"" so to speak. (Since lots of people who are sick have their appetites ruined by the illness and find it hard to eat consistently. Also sometimes a symptom of your illness is also just nausea.)   There are anti-nausea medications on the market that are basically just really thick sugar syrups. It sounds weird but they're quite effective. I used to use one basically every month when I had my period before my endometriosis got diagnosed, because I'd just be dry-heaving for days(literally), and couldn't even keep down water, let alone painkillers. (This is also a time when the painkiller-only DayQuil is good, for getting a painkiller/fever reducer down in a syrupy formula that your stomach doesn't want to immediately retch up.)  Let's not forget that it's also hard to get kids to swallow pills, and something sugary is easier. I hated swallowing pills until I was like 12.  So basically, the sugar in the formula is actually a medicine too, if you think about it. Obviously you shouldn't be eating spoonfuls of sugar all the time, but when you're so sick you can't keep food or medicine down, obviously this is a time we have to say ""fuck it"" and just eat some damn sugar.  For everyone else and every other situation, they have pills."

1200isplenty,37chrm,RWDMARS,-2,Tue May 26 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"My health teacher told me that in eighth grade, and it's always stuck with me since then because it's disturbing and strange. I've avoided them completely since.   But I looked it up just now, and here's what I found:  ""Questions about artificial sweeteners and cancer arose when early studies showed that cyclamate in combination with saccharin caused bladder cancer in laboratory animals. However, results from subsequent carcinogenicity studies (studies that examine whether a substance can cause cancer) of these sweeteners have not provided clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans. Similarly, studies of other FDA-approved sweeteners have not demonstrated clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans.""  Other search results revealed that while there's a definite link, there's no proof of it causing cancer or creating cancer cells.   So while I don't have proof, it's better to avoid, I think, just to be safe. I wouldn't put it in my body.  However, as speculation, I wonder if there's been money poured in by the food industry to stop these studies, like how car companies did in Who Killed the Electric Car?"
1200isplenty,37chrm,RobotCookie,2,Wed May 27 01:51:04 2015 UTC,"That's not really proof. Correlation is not equal to causation. There's a difference between sun exposure and tobacco actually proven to cause cancer and consumption of red meat and use of plastic containers correlating with increased RISK of cancer. If that's the case, go raw vegan and don't use any plastic, stay inside all day, and don't use electronics or beauty products."

1200isplenty,37e4ds,princessponyo,6,Wed May 27 04:06:06 2015 UTC,"My strategy is about half and half.. meaning, half the time my strategy is replace the food I'm craving with a better choice versus half the time I allow myself a small portion (that I log and fit into my daily calorie count) of the real food.  Chips/Salty Snacks - I usually replace with a better choice. I like the kashi pita crisps.. they give me that crunch and saltiness but are a better choice than greasy chips. I also like plain popcorn, with salt, pepper and some lime juice or with cayenne for a kick.  Pasta - I'll be honest here. I like spaghetti squash, a lot! I like zoodles and all the other vegetable noodle concoctions, and I eat them every now and then (gotta get my money's worth out of the spirulzier haha). But if I'm being honest, spaghetti squash and zoodles are delish in their own right but they're not even remotely close to real pasta and for me they don't satisfy the pasta craving.. I know for some people they do and that's fine, but for me they don't. So occasionally I will allow myself some real pasta, I find it's a better way to handle the craving. But I choose whole wheat pasta, I fit it into my calories for the day and I carefully weigh it on my digital scale. I don't have real pasta more than maybe once every 2-3 weeks so for me it's a better way of handling the craving to just have a bit, in a moderate portion size than to try an unsimilar substitution.  Ice cream - I like some of the skinny cow products. Some of them are kind of blah/lacking in flavour, but the mint chocolate skinny cow cone is soo good. President's Choice (Canadian brand) has a lot of really good reasonable cal frozen products.. pretty much all of their greek yogurt bars and kefir bars are delicious.   Rice - I'm weird, sometimes I crave just a big bowl of white rice. But I've pretty swapped out all rice consumption for this brand of products: http://www.seedsofchangefoods.com/our_foods/category.aspx?id=rice_grains ..they make brown rice/quiona blends with beans and different seasonings mixed in. A fairly small portion is very satisfying and goes great with a lot of dishes like stir fries, meat etc if you're really wanting rice. I like leftovers of it in the morning with a single runny yolk egg and some greens stirred in (spinach or kale).  Pizza - I make the pita/tortilla pizza type recipes that often get posted here once in a while. Or I carefully read the labels on frozen pizza, pick one that isn't too bad (usually that means thin crust.. thin crust tend to have less calories and vegetable toppings rather than like 3 meat or something) and then split it with my boyfriend so that he's eating most of it while I eat a slice or two and a big salad. This pizza: http://pizza.mccain.ca/en-ca/Pizza/UltraThinCrustPizza/Pages/UltraThinCrustPizzaRoastedVegetableAndGoatCheese.aspx is 160 calories for 1/4 of the pizza or 320 for half of the pizza. I can actually work that into my calories for the day depending on what else I'm eating. Usually we'll each eat half each and have a salad. It's still high in sodium of course and not really ""healthy"" but once in a while, like every few weeks, it's not that bad."

Without taking the time to measure the leftover flour or oil, this ends up being on the high end of 280 calories according to MFP before bun.

And a serving of actual fruit will have more fibre (ie. keep you more satisfied) than the orange juice (which is all the sugar without any fiber). The only other thing would be that I probably wouldn't make a too frequent habit out of things like protein bars, even if you are working out they're still basically a processed food not a natural food and should really only be treated as a once in a while convenience food. Yeah, they're healthier than a candy bar but it's easy to fall into the trap of oh, it's a protein bar and it's super healthy but honestly they often have ingredients like high fructose corn syrup and are not always the healthiest option. Good snack ideas with protein and reasonable calories can also include string cheese, greek yogurt or 1% cottage cheese, deli turkey wraped around a dill pickle spear or a string cheese, or a handful of nuts (almonds or cashews etc)."
1200isplenty,37eoo5,acciochocolate,4,Wed May 27 12:46:09 2015 UTC,"Eat more at breakfast--shoot for around 300 calories. You could add a hardboiled egg or two, and/or a piece of fruit. Like the other commenters said, I'd lose the granola bar, chips and orange juice, or at least don't have them all in one day. Just one of those things in a day is cool, but that's 340 calories of empty sugar, which is probably why you feel unsatisfied.   A registered dietitian told me to eat at least three foods with every meal/snack and to make sure at least one of the three items is a protein. So for example, if you want one serving of chips for a snack, add couple slices of turkey and a string cheese on the side to fill you up more. If you want orange juice, have some eggs and veggies with it. This prevents the kind of snacking that I'm guilty of, where I feel hungry and eat something that isn't filling like chips, but that doesn't fill me up, so then I have some candy, then I grab a granola bar, then a handful of raisins, etc. and by the time I feel full, I've eaten a lot more than if I had just started with a thoughtful snack that was balanced with a protein, fat, and carb. It's been very helpful for me to think about planning my meals and snacks that way and I feel a lot less hungry when I stick to the three-food protein-fat-carb ratio. You can do it and still keep it within 1,200 cals. Hope this helps!"

I would try to get a serving of fruit in each day.. it can just be handful of strawberries at breakfast or something like that. Pears, nectarines, plums, peaches.. good for taking on the go. And you didn't eat too many servings of veggies (I shouldn't be talking.. I didn't either yesterday haha).. the asparagus is maybe 1-2 servings and the spinach is pretty minimal. At most you had maybe 3 servings of veggies.. I would aim for more like 5-6 servings of veg per day (of course you might not achieve that every day but it's good to aim for). Salads are obviously a great way to kill like 3-4 servings of veg in one go. I'm sure you already know this but the two cans of coke aren't doing a lot for you.. try diet pop, try plain homemade iced tea/coffee (look into stevia as a zero cal sweetner), crystal light etc etc.. yeah, some people will argue that artifical sweetners are bad for you, but at this point switching over to diet is still better than the two full sugar cans because that would free up nearly 300 calories for vegetables, a snack of fruit, etc."

Phytates in grain products (as well as tannins and antacids which are less likely to be part of your regular diet) can inhibit absorption for an already difficult to process nutrient, making it hard to get the amount you need!"

So breakfast was just black coffee and a small bowl of cherries. Not the healthiest to nearly skip breakfast I don't think it's a big deal to do once in a while and it saved my later meals from going over my daily limit so..  At the BBQ, I was going to actually skip the bun to save on calories and carbs. But then I added everything in and it seemed like it would fit in to have a bun, which was actually an awesome treat for me because I rarely eat bread/buns etc. I skipped all the high cals toppings they had like cheese, french's fried onions and bacon, and just kept it simple with a very light spread of mayo, plus jalapanos for that kick, and lettuce/tomato. And I had to skip all the side dishes like potato salad, macaroni salad etc but honestly I was very full from just the burger. I can't believe I used to eat a burger with cheese plus like a big plate of side dishes and probably dessert!  Dinner was also a BBQ but at my mom's, and she tends to be more health conscious so it was grilled chicken legs very lightly brushed with BBQ sauce (I factored in a tablespoon into my calorie counter but there was probably less on my 2 legs). I also had a fruit and feta salad which had berries, slivered almonds, feta and craisins. I measured the feta on my digital scale to be sure I didn't have too much, and I measured the dresssing and craisins with a tablespoon. I just estimated on the berries and lettuce.   Today I'm loading up on veg most of the day, and maybe fish and veg for dinner, since yesterday was really meat heavy."

1200isplenty,37c6da,Feyrn,17,Tue May 26 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"It also depends on what speed of weight loss you're asking for though.. if you're asking MFP to help you lose 2 lbs a week (the max you can ask for per week), it's automatically going to cut you down to 1200 cals (the lowest it recommends) even with some exercise factored in.. because unless you're a very large person (like well into the 200 lbs range) you can't lose at a rate of 2 per week without a fairly substantial caloric defecit, which includes both exercise and restricting your calories. If you changed the rate of weight loss to 1 lb a week, it will probably give you more calories.   Basically, you need a defecit of approximately 3500 calories (which can be achieved from either exercise or eating less calories than your body burns normally, or a combo of both) to lose one lb of body fat. Not getting into water weight, muscle, metabolism, etc as those are factors too. If you're exercising a lot you can definitely up your calories a bit.. just be careful not to overestimate what you burn through exericse (both the machines at the gym and MFP are known for this) or to eat back ALL the calories you burn from exercise.   And if by the calculator in the side bar you're referring to the TDEE calculator, that isn't suggesting calories you should consume to lose weight but rather the calories you would need to eat each day to maintain your current weight. You take your TDEE and then eat below that number.. theoretically as long as you eat below that number you should lose weight, because you're creating a caloric defecit where your body is not eating as many calories as it burns, so can turn to burning fat in the body as an energy source. The bigger your caloric defecit (ie. the further below your TDEE you eat), the faster you will lose weight."

Sometimes I'd cut up some cherry tomatoes and throw those in too. The avocado goes a long way and the honey mustard is really just for a little flavor so add as much chicken as you want to make it to your preference of creaminess. This used to make enough to last for 2 people 2/3 meals each between my mom and me. It averaged out to about 100 calories per serving for me but that can be adjusted by the size of your serving as well.  PS It tastes great in a lettuce boat!"
1200isplenty,37dosf,WWHarleyRider,2,Wed May 27 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"One option is to use plain (ie. unsweetened) fat-free greek yogurt instead of mayo.. not sure if you would consider that pricey? There's no particular recipe but just add greek yogurt in proportion to your diced chicken until it reaches the moistness level that you like. Seasoning well will make all the difference.. I like a bit of honey mustard in mine like the person below but you could use dijon or dried mustard power, salt and pepper, and I like a pinch of paprika. I load mine with finely diced veggies (usually celery, red and/or green pepper or cucumber) which bulks it up but adds virtually no calories.. and sometimes I'll add either dried cranberries (just be careful on the portion) or grape halves as I like that sweet and salty combination. And like the other person has already mentioned to save more calories I often skip the bread and eat it ""lettuce cup"" or ""lettuce wrap"" style.. meaning I take some large romaine boats (and wrap the chicken salad up in that) or some large iceberg leaves and it's sort of like a little cup/bowl that holds the chicken salad. Crackers can be a more portion controlled option too.. I have a brand of whole grain crackers I like that's 90 calories for a serving and has similar fiber to whole wheat bread so to dip those into the chicken salad it's much less than if I ate two slices of bread, or something like a bagel or tortilla wrap etc."

Leaving freezer doors open for 2-3 hours every time they counted inventory (all of the product in the freezer would thaw and refreeze several time a week). I've witnessed people dropping foreign objects in the soups and continue serving it until it is low enough to pull the object out or if it's another liquid, they just mix it in. At the end of the night the soup is supposed to go in an ice bath to quickly drop the temperature (it has 6 hours to go from 170 F to 40 F. They couldn't even do this correctly so overnight the soups are sitting around 70-90 F for a minimum of 7 hours. They cut all portions down by 25% too. When I mentioned all of this to the district manager, his response to me was, ""our customers believe they are getting a higher quality of food so we are able to charge them more for it.""  The lettuce and spinach for the salads all come from the same bags that McDonald's uses. They receive all of their meat precooked and frozen, they just defrost and portion it out. All of their pasta is frozen bags that they microwave (also frequently changing dates on so they don't have to throw away food).   Basically you're getting the same quality of food that you would at any other fast food restaurant, you're just paying almost twice as much because Panera Bread is banking on the customers not knowing that they don't actually cook your food or that everything comes out of a bag. The employees are trained that expiration dates are a suggestion, not a rule. Also, when I first got there, the store I was working at didn't have hot running water or a working ice machine for over a week. You can't wash your hands or dishes by state standards without hot running water and of course for that week they didn't ice the soups at all!"

1200isplenty,376snt,Ariadne89,13,Mon May 25 12:44:50 2015 UTC,"Awesome post, I really like all the tips! Is it okay if I add a few more ideas/categories?  Thai/Vietnamese - mango salad, fresh spring rolls (ie. not the deep fried kind in batter but the kind in rice wrappers with lots of veggies) and most soups (such as pho, tom yum, etc) are reasonable options. Pad Thai should be avoided unless you're going to take at least half of it home.. I know it's delicious but unforuntaely it packs a lot of calories with all the noodles, peanuts, fried tofu, etc. Curry dishes (like thai green curry, thai red curry etc) can also pack a LOT of calories depending on how the restaurant cooks it (usually there's a lot of coconut milk, sometimes additonal oil etc).. but if you do go with a curry, a vegetarian or shrimp one will generally have less calories than chicken or pork.   Indian - A lot of Indian food, or at least the westernized versions of it served in North America, can be pretty high cal! Daal (lentil soup) is delish, low cal and full of fibre for a starter. Avoid butter chicken for sure, and sadly most things with paneer are very high cal. Things with ""korma"" in the name are very high cal too. Don't go nuts on naan.. I know it's delish but it's the equivalent of eating a whole bread basket at an Italian restaurant. Vegetarian or chicken biryani can be decent if you don't go nuts on the rice/portion size, take some home with you. Eggplant dishes (such as Baingan Bharta), cauliflower dishes (like aloo gobi), chickepea dishes (channa masala) and other vegetable based dishes aren't too bad, nor is a moderate portion of tandoori chicken/fish/goat.  Burger joint - This is probably a well known tip already but ask if you can get your burger served on lettuce, and then eat it with a fork or wrap it up in the lettuce, with the lettuce acting as a bun. Again, I know this is obvious but make good choices with toppings.. pickles, jalapenos, tomatoes, argula, mustard, cucumber etc all add flavour to your burger without a lot of calories. Goat cheese (and all other cheeses), fried onions, tons of sauces/mayos/sugary ketchups, and avacado all add a lot of calories/fat on top of what you're already getting from a burger patty. I love avacado as much as everyone else, but alot of people will fool themselves into seeing a burger with avacado and goat cheese or feta and thinking it's so healthy because it's avacado (healthy fats) but it can just add way too many calories on top of the meat. Also don't fool yourself into thinking that sweet potato fries are way healthier than regular fries.. sure sweet potato has a bit more fibre and vitamin A but in terms of overall calories and fat, sweet potato fries usually don't have substantially less than regular french fries, they're still usually fried.   Movie Theatre - If you MUST snack at the movie theatre and don't want to sneak something in your purse, see if you can get totally plain, unbuttered popcorn, and then just season it with salt and pepper. The nachoes are really bad, more calories than a full meal. Some of the candy options like sour patch kids, swedish berries etc aren't horrible if you can limit yourself to a reasonable portion, although it's still basically empty calories.  Mexican - your advice is good but even better in my opinion is to skip the tortilla entirely and ask for like a ""bowl"" style burrito.. that way you're just getting the protein (whether that's beans or meat or both) and veggies and toppings."

I used to live in a Chinatown, and if you're going to a traditional Chinese restaurant there are healthy options.  You can get plain steamed green vegetables that come with sauce on the side.   Just avoid the sauce and you've got something healthy.   The brothy soups i would imagine are also low cal as long as you don't eat too much of the noodles, which i think you can order the soup without.   A place i used to go to all the time knew i didn't eat a lot of the noodles so whenever i ordered soup they'd give me 1/4 of the usual serving.   You can get a lot of food steamed with sauces on the side,  so that would cut down on a lot of calories. I still haven't figured out low cal Korean food.... Unless soon dobu soup would count."
1200isplenty,376snt,BleachBody,2,Mon May 25 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Many traditional Chinese cuisines are very healthy - very little is deep fried (unless it's street food and meant to be eaten in a tiny portion), the portions are small and usually a meal is soup + rice + a steamed or stir-fried protein with little oil + steamed green vegetable of some kind.  Sauces are usually made of broth and a few seasonings thickened with no more than a tsp of potato starch, though in the North they do tend to have heavier more calorific things like zhajiangmian and mantou.  Chinese-American food is another beast entirely.  For Korean, if you stick to grilled meat/seafood/vegetables and the banchan that don't have sweet dressings, I bet you could keep the calories down. And depending on how they do their bibimbap you might be surprised how little rice is actually in there sometimes.  Our local Korean bibimbap has lots of vegetables and meat and probably less than a cup of rice underneath to get the crunchy rice on the sides when it's mixed up.  I know some other places do add a huge amount of rice though.  Shabu shabu/hotpot would be good too.  (But tteokbokki is bad news, those little rice cakes are super calorific.)"
1200isplenty,376snt,42fortytwo42,3,Mon May 25 15:25:41 2015 UTC,"sorry if this is a dumb question, but can you explain the high sodium thing?"
1200isplenty,376snt,drzoidburger,5,Wed May 27 10:23:15 2015 UTC,"Sciencey answer: Your body's response to increased sodium intake is to also increase body water in order to maintain a normal plasma osmolality. So consuming a lot of sodium triggers an increase in ADH in the kidney, which increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts (a part of your kidneys). The net result is that you don't pee out as much water because your body is trying to hold onto it. Your body's ""water weight"" will increase relative to normal, and the next day when you step onto the scale, the number will be higher than it should be. You've probably noticed this is if you've ever weighed yourself the morning after eating a salty dinner or late-night snack."
1200isplenty,376snt,jmcorcoran,3,Mon May 25 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"Not the most detailed info but I hope this helps: ""Excess sodium intake can temporarily increase your body weight by about 2 to 3 pounds within a day or two of consumption. The increase in body weight comes from fluid retention, which also causes swelling in the face and hands and, for some, pain in the joints. The weight gain usually corrects itself when you return your sodium intake to healthy levels -- less than 2,300 milligrams per day if you aren't in a high-risk group, and 1,500 milligrams per day if you are.""

1200isplenty,376snt,absentdandelion,3,Mon May 25 17:33:30 2015 UTC,Long story short: more sodium (salt) means your body holds onto more water so it can maintain the same ratio of sodium:water.  Water weighs a lot so the scale may spike temporarily!

1200isplenty,379t4s,drzoidburger,5,Tue May 26 17:50:18 2015 UTC,"500 calories under your TDEE is always what I've read, so in cases of those who are quite overweight they'd lose on 1200, but they would be ravenous and their bodies would be weak and lack energy.  Right now I'm 6'1, 170, and looking to lose 10 more pounds; my TDEE is about 2200 calories a day. I would be so hungry and probably sickly-looking on 1200 calories.   Teenagers, well...to be honest I think a 1200-calorie diet is suitable for some, such as a mildly overweight, short female. However, it should be medically supervised, as teenagers are in a very vulnerable part of their lives/their brains are not fully developed, leading them to seek reckless behavior. This could lead to them becoming obsessed with weight loss/developing an eating disorder."
1200isplenty,3795uv,Bunny_Wabbit,6,Mon May 25 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"Here are some changes that would make your food more filling for fewer calories.  Substitute the pasta for zoodles (zucchini noodles) and the battered cod for non-battered and grilled.  Nix the french bread with the omelette. Increase the number of egg whites in your omelette to compensate. Add three large handfuls of baby leaf spinach to the omelette.  Replace strawberry water with something zero cal: green tea, coffee, water.  No french bread at lunch either. Have the soup on its own. Follow up with some protein: a shake, some greek yogurt with frozen berries and splenda, cottage cheese.  No crisps, no bread as snacks! Eat vegetables. Cucumber. Celery. Bags of salad. Cherry tomatoes. Include small amounts of protein like some smoked salmon, chicken breast slices.  Redefine what food you eat. Pasta, battered cod, french bread, crisps, strawberry water, and chocolate are all treats in my eyes. I would eat them once every few months. You had them all in one day!"
1200isplenty,3795uv,grizzle12,1 point,Tue May 26 10:39:19 2015 UTC,"I have a question, where do you get zoodles? Is there a way to get them pre-made? As someone who goes to work early and comes home late, zoodles sound amazing, but only with a lot of time."
1200isplenty,3795uv,PenisTrain,10,Thu May 28 12:24:24 2015 UTC,"You need to add bulk to your diet and cut down on the white bread and sugar. Sugars are incredibly addictive, so when you suddenly cut them down, you will begin to feel incredibly hungry. Try cutting the bread and crisps and add a large salad for dinner and chock some veggies into your omelette. How about spinach, mushrooms, and onions for the omelette and a large arugula, shaved carrot and apple salad for dinner?"
1200isplenty,3795uv,mrsbaltar,5,Mon May 25 22:41:39 2015 UTC,"It's also amazing the amount of vegetables and even fruit (although to a lesser degree) you can eat for the same number of calories as things like white bread. Don't get me wrong, a nice crusty baguette is one of my favorite things in the world, but things like that always leave me feeling sluggish and not full.  Also, just an aside, are you taking any vitamins? I was a bit worried when I started at 1,200 that I might not be getting all the nutrients I need, especially on days when I'm too busy to cook and my 1,200 consists of whatever I can manage to grab before work. I started taking plain old adult multivitamin everyday and I feel a lot better :)"
1200isplenty,3795uv,dnageiw,2,Mon May 25 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right.  One thing worth adding is if you really want bread, go for whole grain with a minimum of 3g fiber per slice."
1200isplenty,3795uv,lizzievicarious,2,Mon May 25 23:40:55 2015 UTC,"As others here have pointed out, you really like your carbs. That's not inherently a bad thing, but carbs are pretty calorie-dense, so you'll find you have less room for flexibility in what you eat if every meal is accompanied by bread. To fill up, I tend to keep carbs to a minimum and bulk up on other things, or I eat different types of carbs.  Soups are generally pretty good, but instead of French bread maybe you could eat your soup with some oyster crackers or saltines. For breakfast, instead of eating your omelette with a chunk of French bread, you can eat it with half a sweet potato or some oatmeal. That way you get your carb fix, but it's not as high in calories.  Better yet is to replace those carbs with vegetables. Maybe eat a tomato with your omelette instead of the French bread. Or eat your soup with carrot sticks on the side. This can be tough for someone who loves carbs and hates vegetables, which is why I recommend changing up your carbs first."
1200isplenty,3795uv,drzoidburger,2,Tue May 26 17:59:45 2015 UTC,"Switch out your white, simple carbs for more filling carbs.  For example, a large sweet potato is 160 calories (at least the ones I get/weigh), and it's quite filling; sometimes I have half of one with just a dab of Greek yogurt and cinnamon with breakfast (in fact, that's what I had today; had it early this morning and just now getting a bit peckish at mid-afternoon)."

Macaroni & cheese is my absolute favorite, but unfortunately, I am no longer in the days of blissful ignorance and I won't allow myself to pour two cheese packages over a 1/2 kilo of pasta and split it with my boyfriend. Nope, I've moved on to bigger and better things! :P  Anyway, this was by and large a huge experiment and I had no idea if it was going to work. We just so happen to be in Greece, so I thought adding some real Greek yogurt (instead of milk & butter) to the Laughing Cow cheese would be a worthwhile test. It turned out to be way better than I thought and I'll be making this regularly now! (Quick note on the yogurt: I didn't have access to a measuring cup so I had to eyeball it. I was aiming for a little over a 1/2 cup, or a little over 100g, so that's why it says .7 cups in MFP. You may want to use more or less depending on how runny or tangy your yogurt brand is; just play around with it til it seems right.)  If you aren't familiar with celeriac or don't have access to it, I'd recommend trying the recipe with cauliflower or something similar instead. That was our original intent before we saw the celeriac for a fraction of the price (cauliflower is like $3.50 a head here in Greece!!).   My boyfriend was a little bit apprehensive of this at first because he's sort of a 'if I'm gonna eat pasta, I want pasta damnit!' kinda guy. He absolutely loved it. I'm convinced you could please the pickiest of eaters with this one.  Oh yeah, and the caloric info is for if you split the pot into 8 servings. One eighth of the giant pot was plenty for me, but if you split it into 6, it would still only be 316 calories per serving -- not bad for a huge bowl of pasta.  Let me know if you enjoy it, and please, someone should try baking it with some real cheese on top! I think it'd be amazing but we don't have an oven! :P"

1200isplenty,370e1q,laur5446,23,Sat May 23 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"As laur5446 mentioned, mfp recommends 1-2 per week. However, since you just started again, it's likely that the 9 lb drop was mostly water weight and that it will slow down to around 2 a week as you continue."

You'd be better off setting goals based on a percentage of your TDEE. 20% less than your current TDEE is considered a reasonable deficit and not super difficult. Going over 35% is considered quite aggressive."

1200isplenty,370e1q,linziboo,1 point,Mon May 25 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"Nine pounds in a week is a lot but if it was the first week it was probably primarily water weight (one gallon of water is about eight pounds and I know people who can sweat off 8 pounds in a run) and probably 2-3 pounds actual fat/tissue.   It also depends on your activity level, how much you weigh, how tall you are, how old you are, etc. Nine pounds a week EVERY week isn't healthy, but your first week should be fine. I would focus on keeping that sustainable so you can still lose weight/maintain it without exercise or a little exercise.  Keep up the good work! Don't be afraid to go over 1200 (1250 or 1300) if you need to. It's much more discouraging to beat yourself up about not making 1200 than it is to just accept it and eat a little less the next day."

Just rinse the noodles well, use scissors to cut them a couple times if want them to be easier to eat, then put them into any kind of broth about 20 minutes before you add meat or vegetables. I typically use a soy sauce broth, but I think any kind of broth would be fine.  The one thing I have never done is attempt to use them as a pasta substitute.

This is where you'll find produce, dairy, meats, etc.  Processed foods and a lot of the carbs stay in the middle of the store.  The exception to this is the bakery though, so beware!  2) Start your shopping trip at a place that only sells produce - a farm stand, farmers market, produce shop, etc.  Pick up the bulk of your groceries there, and then build a menu around that.  Then shop ONLY for the needed items at your regular grocery store.  Good luck!"

There is no magic trick to being able to stick to a 1200cal/day but I will give you advice what works for me (everyone is different):   Buy ingredients that are easy and fast to prepare. I buy fresh fruit and veggies to fill my meals with, but sometimes your days are so hectic you don't have time to steam/cut up those things. Frozen fruit is great for this, Birds Eye Steamfresh frozen veggies take minutes in the microwave. Frozen fruits can be thrown into a smoothie. If you know you're going to have a long day, prepare a quick meal the night before. You can find low cal frozen meals as well. The easiest way rationalize a bad choice is that you didn't have time to prepare a healthy meal.  Flexible dieting. Are you craving ice cream? One scoop will not hurt. What I usually do when I am craving something and I'm too close to my limit, is to put it in MFP for the next day. I have something to look forward to, I'm super excited for it and by the time I get to eat it, even that one scoop is delicious. Also, you can plan the rest of your day around it, too. Restaurants are also not off limits! Fasting for the day until your restaurant meal really isn't going to hurt you or your metabolism. Order a healthy alternative, restaurants have a way of making everything taste good so once you're eating it, you're really not going to be wishing you had that big juicy burger. You will still feel satisfied, and honestly at a restaurant you'll be getting in half, if not all, of your calories in one sitting. Seriously. Look up recipes, there are some really amazing recipes you can make that are low calorie and still taste great. Losing weight is not restricted to boring celery sticks and carrots all day. You WILL end up bingeing if you restrict yourself to the same boring foods all the time. Load up your plate with lots of veggies, I prefer steamed with Mrs. dash salt-free seasoning. Low calorie, delicious and super filling. There are thousands of ways to mix up a meal. If I'm being honest I don't know the truth behind this, but they say your body literally gets addicted to sugar. It will be hard getting over that hump, but after the first couple of weeks you will be craving sugars from fresh fruits instead of cupcakes. I honestly think our tastebuds change when we are choosing a healthy diet. If you can just push through the first couple of weeks, it does get easier. Find a form of exercising you enjoy. There is 100s of things to choose from; weight lifting, hiking, dancing, kickboxing, the list goes on and on. Just anything to keep you moving, especially since most of your day is sedentary. Not only will exercise burn some calories, it keeps you motivated and entertained, and it definitely keeps you away from the pantry for a few hours. You may even find a new passion. Don't be afraid to try everything once. Ask yourself if you really are hungry. Those cravings are probably mostly coming from boredom or stress. Find other ways you can fill those voids. I like to go outside and play with my dog, clean, do laundry, prepare my meal for later, and exercise. Even watching TV and getting sucked into a good movie/show helps, but watch out for cravings then, too. A lot of people like to snack while they watch TV, even me. Frozen grapes are honestly a great alternative. Only ~60cal/cup, and you can kinda just suck on them while you eat them so it takes a little longer.   -Shut yourself down right away when you get a craving. Seriously don't even think twice about grabbing those chips or that bar of chocolate if you know you won't be able to eat it at a reasonable portion.  It's really easy to rationalize it (I've been good all day, I'm stressed, etc). I used to do it all the time. Re-direct yourself to some fruit or veggies if you really need to eat something.  I really don't know what else to say, because honestly like I said, it really boils down to self control. Think about being at the beach in that bikini, the joy you will feel when the scale is at your goal. I like to think about how good I am feeling when I eat great. I know 1200 is ideal, but really, you can eat 1300-1400 calories and still lose weight. Don't be too strict on yourself, if there is a day you slip up don't get down and think of it as an excuse to continue eating horribly. Pick yourself back up, take a run, drink some tea, have a hot shower. It really is soothing and de-stresses you from being upset with yourself about your choices. Think positively about your weight loss. Any more questions, feel free to ask."

I eat a lot of veggies because they're really filling for a little bit of calories. Recently, I've tried to cut out some of the carbs from my diet (in the form of rice--I'm Chinese, I'm used to eating a LOT of rice and it's calorie heavy).  Since your doctor gave you the OK for a 1200kcal day, I would also suggest you go slow. Drop from 1500 to 1400, 1300, and then finally 1200. Making too huge of a leap is a little difficult.  Lastly, remember! This isn't a diet. Plan your meals for a little bit of indulgence here and there. :) If you approach it with the mindset of ""this is a diet, I just have to bear it"" it's no good at all.   Good luck on your goal, and you've done so well so far! Thirty pounds is a LOT of weight. Congrats on what you've done, and keep at it. <3"

1200isplenty,36s1hz,acciochocolate,6,Thu May 21 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"One of the main focus points of Fed Up was the type of sugar you eat.   A coke causes your body to respond very differently than cherries. So if you are getting your sugar from raw fruit (along with fiber and water), I wouldn't stress too much about it.  The government doesn't set sugar intake, but WHO did suggest 25g per day for a 2K diet.  I can reach this some days, but it's incredibly hard to do often, let alone consistently.  Your big hang up seems to be breakfast.  /u/ElCidVargas makes a good swap out for your yogurt.  Greek yogurt has only 6g of sugar and 17g of protein compared to the yogurt in your MFP entry (16g sugar and 11g protein).    You could also try adding another high-protein or high-fiber breakfast food and cutting what you currently eat in half (to 97 calories, 17g sugar).  For example, a hard-boiled egg is only 80 calories, but has 6g of protein and 0.6g of sugar.  Or you could do a piece of whole grain/wheat toast which has 69 calories, but only 1.6g of sugar.  Top that toast with greek yogurt and cherries and some yummy herbs!"

Theyre made my a company called FlatOut Flatbread. They also make ones for sandwiches, but the ones i use for the pizza are only 90 calories and are about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide. Theyre pretty good and i plan on buying these from now on.  I use about 1/2 cup of a marinara sauce (65-70 calories).  (Marinara or red sauces are great for low calorie dishes)  1/4 cup of light mozzarella cheese is about 70 calories. (I use about 1/3, so about 85 for me)    Thats only 245 calories.   Im just a cheese pizza person but i still have over 100 calories to play with for any meats i would want to put on it to get up to the 350. Veggies are negligible as well.    I just use my skillet to make the pizza as it makes the flatbread turn out like a thin crust pizza. 100% recommend.   And for all those of you who may be counting carbs, these flat breads are only 7g net carbs, and 9g of protein."

The plus side is that you can probably get a good buzz for fewer calories but try to be mindful when you're tossing the drinks back."

So like my TDEE is 1700 for example but I eat at 1200 so that I can lose weight.

1200isplenty,36mrkk,leeshmeesh,7,Wed May 20 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"Choosing to skip food in favor of alcohol is possible, but a very slippery slope. Drinking on top of such a huge deficit is going to get you much drunker, much faster. What I typically do if I'm planning a night out is to save up throughout the week (100 cals/day or so), so that I have more to work with when I'm drinking, but can still eat that day. I definitely would not recommend drinking heavily after only eating 400-600 calories. Keep in mind that your reduced caloric intake will drastically reduce your alcohol tolerance. Someone just recently posted about it here.  There are ways to drink and still stay within your calorie range. I typically drink rum and diet coke or vodka and club soda. Sticking with liquor and calorie free mixers is your best bet. Drink them slowly. Also be cautious of your pours - 5 oz. of wine is not as much as you're probably drinking in each glass! I don't even drink beer - it is NOT your friend when trying to lose weight.   Additionally, salads are not your only option when you're trying to stay under calories, but not be hungry! That's what this sub is all about - sharing creative, delicious recipes and getting rid of the mentality that salads and ""rabbit food"" are the only way to reduce your caloric intake.   Lastly, in addition to the scale, be sure to take measurements (chest, waist, hips) and progress pictures. They tell a lot more about your body than a scale can."
1200isplenty,36mrkk,abutuma,1 point,Wed May 20 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"Does that actually work? I mean, saving up calories like that? I always thought that it was, you know, the amount per day that mattered. So you'll shave off 100/per day for a week then drink the extra 700 on the weekend?  Rum and cokes sound awesome! I haven't been able to find rum in a long time, and for some reason I was under the impression it's higher calorie because it's sweet. My biggest issue is that, since we're traveling, it's very hard to find low/no calorie mixers. We tried one lemon sprite mix thing that was really low calorie, but it was so freakin' acidic, my esophagus was torn up by the end of the night. None of that haha. So I usually have to stick with something like wine, and it can take me over six 5 oz. glasses to get drunk. And you're right, 5 oz. is a lot less than I thought! That's why I measure with a shot glass. ;) Whenever we can get our hands on Sprite Zero that isn't €1/can, I like to mix the wine with that to make it go further.   I have been loving this sub for that! We tried the cabbage lasagna and couldn't believe how awesome it was. Unfortunately, a lot of the items involve brand-specific low calorie things that I can't find in the random supermarkets I go to, not to mention we're usually cooking sans oven or even pan, so I'm often just limited to salad. I think when I get back to the US, it'll be a whole lot easier to track/maintain/buy low calorie foods. I miss Boca burgers!  Oh yeah, about that...I'm definitely on the hunt for measuring tape. Haven't found a sewing store yet. Been thinking of trying to do it with random items (marking rope?) but don't know how accurate that'll be haha."

I've noticed in some products there's no listing for aspartame in the ingredients list (perhaps because it's a negligible amount? Pure speculation on my part). However, I always check if there's a PKU warning (for those with phenylketonuria) since aspartame causes a bad reaction for those with PKU. So, long story short, if it has a PKU warning on it, I assume there's aspartame in the product!"

Oiling the bowl beforehand in optional, and I skipped the step. Crack in your eggs, sprinkle parmesan (or other cheeses) and salt on top. Set your bowl into the oven, bake for 10-15 minutes based on how well you want your eggs done. I shoot for just set and slightly jiggly, because your eggs will continue to cook in the container.

1200isplenty,36j08p,ofcrazed,3,Tue May 19 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"I've always had this approach to it as well. I usually prefer to skip breakfast entirely, eat 100-200 calories on my lunch break, eat another 100-200 as an afternoon snack,and then for the evening I'll eat a pretty sizeable dinner or kind of graze my way to my calorie goal after work. I just can't stand going to sleep hungry. I did try eating a hard boiled egg for breakfast and it didn't seem to affect my routine but other times when I have some carb based breakfast (usually a fiber one bar) I feel hungry all day. So for me I can only do this I guess if it's some high in protein and doesn't make blood sugar spike"
1200isplenty,36j08p,Pookie_face,2,Tue May 19 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"I've started doing this lately too. I used to just have coffee, and then eat around 12-2 in the afternoon. But my job keeps me from being able to eat until sometimes 3-4, which by then I'm starving and eat way too much.  So now I eat 2 boiled eggs (sometimes with some turkey bacon) with coffee before work which helps tide me  over until I get off. Seems to be working better, especially since I like to go running after I get off sometimes. It feels weird to eat in the morning still but if I'm up early enough and get going, it's not so bad."

Luckily I eat very slow, so I can pretty much eat non-stop through breakfast, to lunch, until my day is pretty much over. Then I rarely feel like I need anything at all in the evening, and in fact, dinner is the meal I'm most willing to skip!  Makes it really hard to sync with others though, most people eat their bulk in the evening! So I easily end up eating all day, finishing off with a huge meal :/"

I make sure to mix in one egg for the protein and extra feeling of being full on so little. I use a cup of almond milk as the liquid.   Never had oatmeal before that. Had no idea I was missing out. Some days I end up remaining kind of full all day while still being able to taste the oatmeal from the morning. Hehe

1200isplenty,36k9oz,kwinters95,11,Wed May 20 00:25:57 2015 UTC,"Start at a reasonable calorie goal. Dont overshoot and try to go from 2000 calories a day to 1200, if that's what you're doing (and I dont know, you know), work your way down if need be.   If you aren't using myfitnesspal, try it out! Its great. Also, consider trying out some kind of water tracking app. Staying hydrated is important, keeps you feeling fuller, plus sometimes when you're hungry, you're actually just thirsty.  As someone who also hates veggies, try and find some noninvasive ways to incorporate them. For example I never liked lettuce, but I started added a leaf or two on my sandwiches (as its pretty flavorless), it gets me used to the taste. Add carrots to your soup, spinach leaves to your eggs or smoothies, little bits here and there you know?  There are also probably some great low cal meals you can try, depending on what you like."

If you do not, then the first thing you need to do is to honestly and as accurately as possible track every calorie you eat for one week.   Then find the average.  Afterwards, calculate your BMR and TDEE, and set realistic goals from there; 1200 calories is a very small amount of calories. In fact, my dietitian told me earlier this week, that a sedentary 100lb 5'2"" woman needs 1200 just for basic bodily functions.   Please keep that in mind when deciding on a calorie goal, and don't be tempted to do something that will be dangerous for your body."
1200isplenty,36k9oz,linkedhorizon,3,Wed May 20 01:50:34 2015 UTC,"How to love veggies:  Cook your veggies in fat and pair them with things you find delicious. Don't worry about being a health nut yet. Roast them in the oven with bacon, olive oil and maple syrup, or under a bed of chicken thighs with skin on. I don't care if the fatlogic people want to mock me, that's how a beginner teaches oneself to enjoy veggies. Stir fry them with your favorite meat.   Steam them with butter.  Melt cheese onto them. Toss olive oil and avocado in your salads. Heck, throw steak in your salads.  You start out including veggies in your meals. Eventually you will discover you like more veggies than you thought at first. As you repeat making the meals you like, slowly increase the amount of veggies and decrease the amount of non-veggie carbs and meat. (Though if you're going keto, I guess you don't need to drop the meat anyway. :D) You will eventually get to a point where you love certain veggies so much (prepared a certain way) that you will be able to prepare them with less calories."
1200isplenty,36k9oz,hello_kritty,2,Wed May 20 13:12:54 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to change your diet/eating habits permanently, I think it is really helpful to make small, incremental changes week-by-week. When I started making changes I found it worked best for me to give myself rules about what I should eat each day rather than completely cutting out foods. For example, I started making sure that I ate 4-5 servings of fruit every single day. I found that just by adding healthy foods to my diet, a lot of the less healthy foods got pushed out. Also, now when I do eat snacky/junk foods or even just higher cal foods like cheese (which I also love), I try to eat the label's serving size. After doing that for awhile, my idea of a normal and satisfying portion really decreased. Long story short, I highly recommend slowly and steadily making changes that you can really stick to in the long run, even if that means it takes awhile to get to where you want to be."
1200isplenty,36k9oz,__applescruff,1 point,Wed May 20 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"Re: cheese. I've found that switching to harder, drier, crumblier cheeses is for the best in terms of calories, moderation and using less overall, while not feeling totally deprived of one of my fav food groups or feeling like I have to eat sad ""diet"" cheese like laughing cow or something (no hate for laughing cow.. the jalapeno flavour is great but it's not the same as real, natural cheese). Feta, for example, is great because you can crumble it up into really tiny little crumbles and even a moderate portion like 20-30 grams goes pretty far on a salad, eggs, taco, whatever if you really crumble it down. A lot of stores will have a ""light"" feta too, which I find that I still enjoy. Hard cheese like all of the Italian ones.. parmesan, asiago, grana padano, etc, those are great for 1200 calorie diets.. I'm talking about REAL parmesan, not the stuff in the green can that's shelf-stable. These cheeses are pricey but consider it a splurge that you can afford if you cut back on other unhealthy foods and it will last a long time, because they pack such a huge cheesey flavour punch that you just need a sprinkle or a bit grated up finely.. think outside the box of parmesan on pasta, it's also amazing on eggs, many vegetables (brocc, asparagus, zucchini, and so on), to liven up a soup. If you go with cheddar, go with a good quality extra old or well-aged.. the old adds a lot of flavour so that I tend to use less of it, aka less calories in my dish. The standard orange American cheese etc or more mild cheddar I try to avoid, it's really easy to grate it up and add a ton. Some of the pre-sliced cheese is decent for sandwiches, throwing into an omlet too, because it's sliced so thin the calories are reasonable.. brands will depend on your area but I'm thinking like the silani slices that are around 60-70 per slice, not the processed neon orange slices. Pre-portioned stuff like string cheese and babybels are reasonable and good for snacking, taking on the go, if you can control yourself to just eat one in a sitting. Personally, I mostly avoid mozarella, brie, harvati, gouda, and most of the other softer cheeses unless I'm having a cheat, because I find it's easier to binge on them, and they're so dense in calories.  If you're considering buying or already have a digital scale, cheese is one of the things that's really great to weigh and see exactly how many grams you're eating, since it's a more calorically dense item. I don't weight my veggies because they're so low anyways, but I still weigh cheese fairly often.. cheese is one of those things where if you're estimating rather than weighing it's really easy to eyeball and think oh, that's maybe 100 calories of cheese when really it's 300!  As for veggies.. I've been lucky I guess to always like most vegs so can't entirely relate but I imagine it will just be a TON of trial and error, you'll need to be open-minded and experiment with a lot of different veg and preparation methods.. like roasting, steaming, grilling, spiralizing, stir fry, etc etc and see what you like with different veggies. If you try something and you don't like it, don't write it off forever but try it cooked a different way next time. I do think that roasting in the oven tends to be great for veggie haters.. roasting brings out an amazing sweet flavour in veggies that people who were brought up on limp boiled vegetables are often surprised by (not assuming you were brought up like this.. but this was the case with my partner). My favs for roasting are brussel sprouts, carrots, sweet potatoes, asparagus, cauliflower and squash (butternut or buttercup)."

Dinner I usually just have a piece of protein (single piece of fish or chicken mostly, or sometimes beans/lentils/chickpeas) and a big plate of veggies. So my dinners are often only like 300 cals.

1200isplenty,36ik0x,klebsiella_pneumonia,1 point,Wed May 20 00:46:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it tasted like regular noodles in this dish because the sauce is creamy enough to mask the taste. I was craving pasta when I threw this together and it did the trick. Since the calories for each serving is pretty low, you could always add more cheese or even double the amount of sauce. I think cheese really helps mask that weird taste."

The texture is just like noodles and they work well with ramen too (I go to restaurants and ask them to substitute ramen noodles with shirataki noodles). Some people say they smell fishy but I've never smelled anything weird with them.

1200isplenty,36eoro,linkedhorizon,5,Tue May 19 01:06:57 2015 UTC,"Well, to start with, they're two completely different things.   Tempeh can be made with legumes, or it can be made with grains.   And tempeh is fermented with a fungus, for example, and hummus is not fermented at all. The fermentation in and of itself is a huge difference; it increases the bioavailability of nutrients while at the same time aiding in digestion and helping to inhibit anti-nutrients. Generally, tempeh is less processed and therefore a healthier option, though both have their place in a diet, as hummus is spreadable and tempeh is a thick block.   And they taste vastly different--give tempeh a try!"

1200isplenty,36fooo,kansakw3ns,6,Tue May 19 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"Of course you would rather lose 2 lbs a week, but your body is only going to tolerate being sick and tired for so long before you get seriously worse or fall off the wagon because you can't handle it anymore. You need to consider how much you were eating before- total up an average day from before and don't hold anything back. If it's significantly more than 1200 or even 1700, you need to give your body time to adjust to your new diet by scaling back slowly. Please listen to the people in this thread more carefully."

1200isplenty,36fooo,FlyingBaconCandle,5,Tue May 19 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"Everybody is different. Sometimes, yes, very obese people can lose a shit ton of weight in a short amount of time, usually from diet and exercise, and feel fine. But everyone eats differently, has a different metabolism, different body composition, etc etc etc. You see crazy weight loss stories more often than the much more common story of struggling to lose even 10 lbs. because the crazy weight loss stories are more interesting, more inspiring, and therefore more upvoted and shared than the slow and steady stories. I know you must understand all of this intellectually, but I hope you don't have to get more sick to truly realize it."

I guess I just feel like I'm overweight enough to be one of those drastic changes? Like I'll understand if it's harder/ slower after the first twenty lbs or so that I lose but I feel like those first twenty should go pretty quick, if I put in the effort... because I just feel like I'm inundated with these success stories and I should be able to do it too? I know everyone is different I just have this really high expectation for myself because I know it's possible. I'm not going to be heartbroken if it doesn't work out the way I want it to :) and I don't want to make myself sick. I told another user I'm probably going to bump up to 1500 and see how that goes - especially since I'll eventually HAVE to go down to 1200 to keep losing once I hit a plateau (whenever that happens.)

Sure, you can change it through meal timing and doing something like keto, but the the minute you start eating carbs or decide to have breakfast you will be back to dealing with appetite. You cannot control your appetite but you can control your actions. Right now I'm hungry and I still have an hour until lunch time. I could go into the break room and eat a couple of donuts. Would that satisfy my appetite? Probably. But I'm not going to. I'm going to sit here and wait until noon when I will eat my weighed and planned for tuna sandwich on whole wheat bread with raw cucumbers on the side.

I made a ton of substitutions and eliminations, so the original recipe is very likely much more rich in flavor. But I was pretty satisfied with the taste of my lower calorie version.  Note, I’m not a legit baker, so I pretty much just tossed however much of each ingredient I wanted. I didn’t translate her recipe proportionally, but I figure a crisp isn’t an exact science so just go with your gut!  Makes 6 servings  Filling   320 g or 3 whole nectarines (can sub with any fruit) squeeze of lemon juice 10 g or 2.5 tsp white cane sugar (it was what I had on hand; Sara recommends muscovado sugar) 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/2 tsp cinnamon pinch of sea salt 6 g or about 1 tbsp almond flour/meal (can use any type of flour you like--whole wheat or coconut might be good)   Topping   10 g or 2.5 tsp white cane sugar 54 g almond flour/meal 60 g or about 3/4 cup (dry) old-fashioned oats pinch of sea salt 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tbsp honey 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 tbsp unsalted butter, at room temperature   Preheat the oven to 375F. Lightly butter your skillet or baking dish.  Slice the nectarines into one inch pieces. Combine all the filling ingredients together in a mixing bowl and toss. Pour into the baking dish.  For the topping, combine the sugar, almond flour, oats, salt, and cinnamon and mix.

I picked some up at Costco because of the iron content, but as someone who's used to whey protein, I couldn't drink more than a sip or two. Very gritty and it made my smoothie coagulate in a really weird way.

The calories pretty much all come from protein, it isn't gritty, it dissolves well, and it's delicious. Almost all the reviews said that the normal line's vanilla tasted way worse and the natural vanilla was worth the extra 2 g of carbs.

1200isplenty,369ef7,standrightwalkleft,9,Sun May 17 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"Hm. I have a few ideas, maybe a combination of some sort could do something.   How about you try to cut the sizes of the portions, and see where it gets you? That is - in the first week, only eat 3/4 of the portion, next week, only 1/2 of the portion - keep it at that for 2 weeks, see where it takes you. If you can't do anything about the calories per se, maybe going about the volume will give you an idea of where you can cut out ""unnecessaries"". Don't drink your calories. Drink zero calories sodas and forget about alcohol for a while, at least until you've got this volume/calories thing sorted so that you can lose weight, even if slowly. I completely agree about the recipes being posted here usually looking rather bland and little in comparison to what a nice home cooked meal means to most people, but if you have good cooking skills, then by all means, get working, and get creative! You don't have to dive right into a 1200 calorie cut, what you do is you keep track of how you're eating and what you're eating first and try to eliminate the items that you don't need, or try to replace them. So, for example, instead of using butter to fry up stuff, use oil - this is the first step, a baby step, but it helps. Then in the next step, instead of munching on store bought chips, do them yourselves - but do veggie chips instead, and don't fry them, bake them in the oven. The differences, if you put them to work everywhere, will be big. It will be healthier, too. And remember: it's not just what's ""in"" it, it's also the volume. Try to stay full on the things that are not too crazy in calories. Before you eat a meal of which you don't know what's in it, try to drink a lot of water, and eat some veggies beforehand (cucumber & tomato). Try to keep your hunger in control. It's different for everyone, but for me, that means constantly eating and snacking on little things that have not so much calories. I basically pretend I can eat all the time and whatever I want, but of course, I can only eat the things that I want that I have specifically prepared beforehand. Try to not eat the sweets and the dessert. Again, this is depending on what type of person you are - for me it's sometimes easier to leave out the carbs of the main meal and definitely the alcohol than the dessert. In the beginning, leaving out alcohol, the desserts and a portion of my serving was enough to get me over a weight threshold that I thought was impossible - and only then, motivated, did I start actually counting calories.    These are just some ideas. Good luck, and don't give up! You'll get there eventually if you approach this from a very logical and pragmatic point of view. If you fail at some point, don't worry about it. Just keep going the next day. :) And never, ever feel guilty. It will get you no where. Instead, if you feel like the food has defeated you again, acquire more knowledge on the subject. Read papers and studies about nutrition, what different types of athletes eat, how it is biologically possible to be overweight, etc. Sometimes you will discover things that are SO logical and SO crazy obvious that simply by knowing them it will allow you to feel differently towards some foods and your own hunger. Keep at it, you can do it!"

I used to work dish at another place and when I stopped eating the leftover desserts I lost a lot.    As a cook, a lot of our staff have certain restrictions that they ask me to do and it's no problem.  I'll still send the same order every day to the customers but if someone asks for less rice , less sauce, or less oil I don't have any problems doing that.    working catering I would bring home so much food because ""don't waste"" but if you're someone like me who loves food,  having a bunch of wedding leftovers in your fridge constantly= eating wedding leftovers constantly.

Obviously serving the dinner shift is laborious and exhausting so we would snack a lot, and the only snack we could grab on the floor was the heavily refined white bread we served. Unfortunately, that was my only dinner many-a-nights, but if I did choose to have a meal, we had limited selections for a discounted price at the end of our shift that were usually creamy pastas, chicken fingers, pizza, etc. I gained a lot of weight fast even with the activity of being a server (10 lbs in 5 months).

If this is an inappropriate post for this subreddit please let me know and I will delete it.  I will download MyFitnessPal, sounds like a good starting point. The challenge is when a) I don't know the exact ingredients or portion sizes of a lot of what I'm eating, and b) my activity is mostly work-related and hard to quantify. I wear a Fitbit and can at least quantify the number of steps I take, but these apps don't exactly have numbers attached to ""climbed 600 stairs"" or ""moved 120 chairs weighing 10 pounds each."" You know?"
1200isplenty,369ef7,owlsonhats,3,Sun May 17 14:43:07 2015 UTC,It's not inappropriate and you shouldn't delete it. My point is there you should be eating more than 1200 calories.   It doesn't matter if you are off by a factor of 10. As long as you are estimating consistently. You're fitbit should estimate consistently for you. If it says you're burning 400 calories extra a day at your active job and you're really burning 650 extra it is going to show up on the scale as an extra ~1/3 lb lost per week.
1200isplenty,369ef7,Verliezen,2,Sun May 17 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. Yes, I definitely agree that 1200 isn't a magic number for everyone, I'm tall enough and heavy enough that (according to the link in the sidebar) even my BMR is about 40% more than that.   The tool also lists my TDEE as 2100-2500 depending on how many events I've worked that week. 1800-2000 calories a day seems perfectly reasonable on paper, but I'm clearly eating more than I think I am. I just find it difficult to estimate when I'm missing basic information on 1/3 or more of the meals I eat."

Right now I'm tracking macros so discrepancies aren't too serious (kind of shitty but it's not ruining my progress).

These thoughts may be ridiculous now, but they are common thoughts of those with disordered eating, and I'd argue worrying about 20% margin of error is a step in that direction.

Consider eating something other than cereal for breakfast. Protein or complex carbs will keep you feeling full far longer than cereal will. If you really want to have cereal, cut the portion down and add an egg or two on the side.   Consider having fewer calories for breakfast so you have more for lunch, dinner, and snacks.   As far as today goes, you won't die from feeling hungry. If you feel you need a snack, though, maybe eat an egg or find some veggies to snack on."

This happens to me if I eat a lot of sugar in the morning, specifically sugary cereal or pancakes with syrup etc. It causes anxiety, and in turn anxiety can cause diarrhea/upset stomach. It can happen to anyone, but is sometimes related to an underlying condition. Did you get shaky or clammy at all, extremely hungry? If you did, or if diabetes runs in your family, I might check with a doctor."
1200isplenty,362brb,Really_Like_Pancakes,5,Fri May 15 20:15:26 2015 UTC,This should be the top comment. A bowl of sugar might be lower calories but it wont fuel a body well. In people with insulin resistence carbs will make you hungrier overall.

If you're newly reducing your caloric intake, this in and of itself might trigger some anxiety.   Can I ask why you are saving 500+ calories for tea? Tea in and of itself is 0 calories, unless you add milk and sugar (which shouldn't add up to that much). If you're consuming half your daily calories in tea, you're going to be severely lacking in key macro and micronutrients. Especially if you're only eating 1,000 - 1,200 calories/day, you really should make sure as much of those calories as possible contain high proportions of protein, fat, and to a lesser extent, carbohydrates.  I recommend you visit IIFYM.com and try calculating how many grams of protein, fat, and carbs you should be aiming for a day, and make sure you try to get close to those goals.   Skip the tea, and eat some nutritious foods for the rest of the day--veggies, fruit, whole grains, nuts, etc."

Makes much more sense now :)  It's possible that the cereal, being relatively high carb, may contribute. I would recommend aiming for a breakfast that is higher in protein and fat (e.g. eggs with turkey sausage and/or avocado, maybe some cottage cheese), or one that consists more of complex carbs (e.g. oatmeal/porridge). That might help? Also, my anxiety sky rockets when I consume too much caffeine, so if you drank lots of tea or coffee this morning, that might have contributed.  In general, any dietary change causes stress on our hormones and bodies, but if you stick with it, we adjust over time. Good luck!"

1200isplenty,35zgaz,fyretech,32,Thu May 14 20:25:52 2015 UTC,"It might be the ""crabs in a bucket"" thing (ie, not wanting to see someone else succeed where they're not willing to put in th effort) or just well-meaning concern because they don't know what eating healthy looks like, but either way, I think the only thing you can really do is ignore them. Try not to talk about your weight-loss around them because they'll just bring you down. As long as you feel good, they don't really need to know the details, so keep it to yourself even if you're excited (or tell us! We'll be excited for you!).  That said, at your starting weight 1200 honestly is pretty low. Try to keep in mind that as you get lighter, your calorie needs will drop, so you'll need to drop calories to keep losing at the same rate. If you're starting out as low as 1200 calories, you're kind of boxing yourself in so that you'll have nowhere to go when you're closer to your goal weight. If I were you'd, I'd eat more like 1500 for now so you have a little more wiggle room as you lose weight."
1200isplenty,35zgaz,bigchiefhoho,9,Thu May 14 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with this philosophy. She's not really boxing herself in at all, it's just that her weight decrease will not be linear. She'll lose more now than she will later, but the weight will come off faster overall if she sticks to 1200 the whole way instead of gradually lowering to 1200 because she'll eat fewer calories over the same time period. I ate at 1200 for almost a year because I just wanted to get the weight off as fast as possible. If a person eats at 1500 for 6 months, they'll weigh 16 more pounds than they would have after eating 1200 over that time. It's not the biggest deal, of course, but it does add up and will make the process longer.  That said, there does seem to be a lower limit to how few calories people should eat, so people should keep that in mind."
1200isplenty,35zgaz,JoeHova1,7,Fri May 15 20:20:16 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, but I do find that for me personally it was really demoralizing to see my rate of loss decreasing even though I was doing the exact same thing. Plus I find that dramatic cuts are harder to stick to, so dropping to, say, 1600 then 1400 then 1200 can be easier to adjust to. Still, I can totally see how this would vary from person to person, so it's probably just an individual choice whether it'd be better to cut way down from the start or take it a little easier."
1200isplenty,35zgaz,bigchiefhoho,5,Fri May 15 21:51:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fair enough! I can definitely understand not wanting to watch your loss slow down as you get closer to your goal."
1200isplenty,35zgaz,JoeHova1,2,Fri May 15 22:01:24 2015 UTC,"Very much agree with the fact that the number of calories will need to drop in order to keep losing at the same rate after some point. I would also think that people are used to seeing the packaging saying that X thing accounts for 10% of your daily intake, which are based on a 2000 calories diet. This being the usual value pretty much everywhere, I'd say that now it's embedded in our heads that 2000 is definitely the number of calories you should eat daily, period."

At your weight you should start a little higher in calories then drop to 1200 when you hit about 150 pounds. It'll be easier for you to adjust your diet this way.  People are going to be jealous. Nearly all of us have probably experienced thin/health shaming from people fatter than us. Like my slender room-mate. He's never been fat but he secretly hates me achieving things with my health/life and tries to get back at me with food. Every other day he'll say ""we should make a cake!"" or ""let's go get burgers!"" even during conversations about how I'm not happy with how my body looks! Recently we made a Mexican meal that I had counted calories for and done careful cooking of not to go over calories and he has to jump in and drown it all in cheese! Made me so angry.

I generally run on a 2 incline for 15 minutes (generally 2 miles, but I'm thinking about upping the running time to burn more calories because I need to cut whatever that means) then walk with weights at a 6.5 inclines at a 4mph (cause I want dat ass and hope that works out) and finally I'll do like some free weight work. It seems to be doing a little to help me tone up but I still have NO definition."

I'm just hoping it's enough. I usually gain muscle super easily which is a curse/blessing.

Keep in mind this is in real life as I rarely post about myself on reddit. But I feel like people don't understand often so a sub with people struggling with similar situations would be more welcoming. I've been at the weight I want to be at before. I know I'm not crazy for wanting that bod back!"
1200isplenty,35w49x,ironicgoddess,17,Thu May 14 06:16:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of people expressing interest and support here - and support is always great!  But to offer a different view point, I'd give a word of caution.  This sub, and others related, seem to lend themselves to some questionable goal setting (as a small subset of great and appropriate posts).... But, it's not unusual to see users requesting recommendations/opinions for sub-healthy BMI weightloss.  There was a post today in xxfitness from a girl asking for advice on how to (as you sort of put it) ""vanity lose"" to a BMI of 15.... It's gone now, but it was definitely a concerning post.  I think you're treading some shaky ground.  You WILL have users with disordered eating (if we have them here, despite clear warnings, so I doubt you'll avoid them on an even more specific low-BMI sub).  How will you address that?  How will you even be able to distinguish between someone trying to lose a few healthy vanity pounds vs. someone truly unhealthy?  Anyway, just a few thoughts.  The idea of more ""last 10"" discussions sounds great, and we should welcome and encourage those posts.  It's actually what I am trying to acomplish myself, right now.  But I'd exercise some caution in modding such a sub.  Edited for clarity"
1200isplenty,35w49x,grizzle12,11,Thu May 14 02:30:56 2015 UTC,"I understand and am thinking about how to deal with this as well (open to suggestions!). That's why I suggested making it 18+. Realistically though, I realize it's impossible to spot everyone with disordered eating, ESPECIALLY online. I know this might sound bad but here's how I see it. Beyond putting a huge disclaimer and stressing that it's NOT a pro-ana subreddit (including not posting pro-ana material) I don't really think there's much else you can do. I don't like pro-ana websites (although I do support free speech and support their right to exist). People who want to find sites that support disordered eating can find them very easily online. This wouldn't be a pro-ana subreddit. I do believe there's a very distinct difference between a person who's slim and toned (healthy) vs anorexic. I know it can be a fine line sometimes, and I believe most people who diet are going to have disordered eating to some degree. It's hard not to obsess about calories, but the way I see it it's about finding a balance. At the same time I really do like the idea of a sub giving people benefit of the doubt and not accusing everyone of anorexia if they have a day or two where they eat under. It's a sub where you'd join as an adult and take advice at your own risk. For example, I find motivation from a lot of 1200 cal meals posted here, but with my level of activity and height I am much more suited to eating 1500+ (although I could really use a 1200 day after eating 3500 cals yesterday lol). Does that mean I should caution or downvote people who post about eating less just because it wouldn't work for me? I like the idea of a sub targeted towards people who already have a well-founded understanding of nutrition/their suitable caloric intake."
1200isplenty,35w49x,gabbaray,12,Thu May 14 02:53:47 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that I would really caution you on how you word that... ""This is NOT a pro-ana sub!"" is going to sound like a ""The lady doth protest too much"" kinda situation. (To make a semi-shitty analogy, if a sub had to say, ""This is NOT a racist subreddit!"" in their sidebar, I would assume they were a racist subreddit or at least that their subscribers were quite likely to be racist.) I definitely think it is important to acknowledge the possibility of ED stuff, but you don't want to water that seed.  I think the sidebar here walks the balance well enough, with ""We do not tolerate ED-promoting behavior or comments"" at the very end... although I do think that is still an issue here."
1200isplenty,35w49x,soulsincages,3,Thu May 14 03:09:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel you. I'd try to think of better wording for sure!   Edit: I would also like to clarify that the content of the sub would hopefully speak for itself. It wouldn't be like ""We are not a pro-ana sub"" followed by something like ""How to successfully eat under 500 calories a day"" or what not. What I would like to see though is less accusations amongst users and more of a ""to each his own"" attitude in terms of aesthetic goals (I do think it can be perfectly healthy for many people to want to be on the slimmer end of their healthy weight range, just like I believe many people can be healthier be on the heavier end. Again, always consult a doctor or dietitian before trusting strangers online). Also, the sub wouldn't have to be only for people trying to reach the lower end of their normal BMI range. It could also be for someone who is, say, 10 lbs overweight trying to reach the highest end of their healthy BMI range (I use BMI as an example but most of us know it's good as a rough guide at best). Or even for people just looking to recomp!"
1200isplenty,35w49x,xTasteItx,2,Thu May 14 03:14:23 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from. At first I shrugged off your warning but when I started reading the new sub I have to admit it alarmed me a bit. Several people who are 5'4 or taller at 110 lbs. or less and wanting to lose 5-10 MORE pounds feels concerning to me. Glad you added your thoughts here.

Frozen:   Spinach and Cheese Stuffed Shells (2 Shells for 270 cal). With some added veggies/salad this makes a great low calorie lunch or dinner. Chicken Gyoza Potsickers (7 for 200 cal). One of my favorites even before I went 1200 a day...7 of these is a very generous serving size. Reduced Guilt Mac and Cheese (270 cal per tray). I usually put some hot sauce on it for flavor but its a great low cal option for a traditional high cal food. Chicken Chile Lime Burger (150 cal per burger). I usually do no bun, topped with salsa for a very low cal snack, or two for a meal!  Pizza Veggie Burgers (130 cal per burger) Sounds weird, but very good for satisfying pizza cravings. Chicken Cilantro Mini Wontons (4 wontons for 50 cal) When added to some chicken broth, this makes an awesome and easy very low cal snack! Wild Salmon in Yogurt and Mint Sauce With Orzo Pasta, Spinach, and Zucchini (350 calories for a full meal). Very filling and awesome entree. Filet of Sole with Butter Beans and Spinach (190 cal for a full meal). Another AWESOME full entree for a very low calorie count   Other:   Instant Miso Soup (90 cal for 2+ Cups)  (I always end up adding more water at the end because its too salty, so I get even more!) Lite Kettlecorn (110 cal for a pretty decent sized bag) Great snack to satisfy a sweet tooth. Spicy Ranchero Egg White Salad (120 cal for the whole container). So good! Great for a quick and easy lunch. Tomato & Basil Hummus (35 cal for 2 tablespoons) Lower calorie than regular hummus, which is usually about 60 cal for two tablespoons, as it is tomato based, but I genuinely enjoy the taste more! Perfect for snacks. Reduced Guilt Chunky Guacamole (30 cal for 2 tablespoons) This uses low-fat yogurt in place of some of the avocado, but is delicious and works great for a veggie dip or as toppings for other meals, like the chile lime burger!"

1200isplenty,35wrm7,HappiestGiraffe,2,Thu May 14 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"I second most of these suggestions! I am a huge fan of Trader Joe's.  My favorite: I was never a fan of sausage, but they have like 10 varieties of chicken sausage that are delicious. My favorite is the the jalapeno if you like a little kick. I like to slice and sautee two sausages (100 cals each) with some frozen TJ fire roasted peppers and onions (so good!), and then toss with spaghetti squash and either a little marinara or pesto.   They also sell carnitas that I like to split into 4 oz. servings and drizzle 1 tbsp barbeque sauce when I have a barbeque craving.   I've also found their frozen fruits and veggies are usually the best deal around. I can grab bags of frozen fruit for smoothies for about $2.50-$2.99 a bag. They have great veggies as well, like mushroom medley, eggplant and zucchini melange, and artichoke hearts.  If you like healthy dips/spreads, check out the edamame hummus and the spinach and kale greek yogurt dip.   One last thing - if you have a dog, pick up a bag of the chicken or beef jerky treats! Only $1.99 a bag here, and my dog goes crazy for them. Happy shopping!"

Just omit the chicken and it's 255 and vegetarian.  Speaking of, the aioli is just 1tbsp reduced fat mayo, lemon juice, garlic and black pepper. It's delicious and is such a light, refreshing sauce.   I'm also 90% sure I didn't use an entire 1/4 cup of feta so I doubt that added up to 30 calories.

Serves 4  Calories: 272 • Fat: 10g • Protein: 15 • Carbs: 33g  Ingredients   6 cups water, separated 2 T. Better than Bouillon Mushroom base (or 6 cups of stock of your choice) 2 oz. Parmesan cheese (look for one made with vegetarian rennet if you’re veggie!) 2 eggs 1 T. butter 5 oz. baby spinach 4 oz. pasta 160g onion 160g cremini mushroom 86g shiitake mushroom   Instructions   Melt butter in a medium sauce pan or dutch oven. Add in sliced mushrooms and onion. Sautee until veggies are softening and mushrooms have shrunk in size. Add in 5 cups of water and the stock concentrate (or 5 cups of stock), reserving one cup. Bring to a boil and add the pasta to the water.  After six minutes, combine the reserved cup of cold water with the eggs and Parmesan. Beat eggs well with fork until combined. Turn the pot down to medium and slowly drizzle the egg/cheese/water mixture into the soup while stirring.  Add the baby spinach into the pot. Cook soup for 3-4 more minutes on medium, until spinach is wilted and pasta is cooked through.   FREEZER ADJUSTMENT: If freezing, cook the pasta separately for 5 minutes. Pull out, then prepare the soup as usual. This will prevent the pasta from turning to mush when you reheat.  Optional add-ins: garlic, fresh basil, red pepper flakes. I would have added all of these but didn’t have them on hand.  Edit: Even though this is an Italian ""egg drop soup,"" I opted to stir my egg mixture completely into the broth instead of letting it set in ribbons. It gave the broth some richness and complexity. If you would prefer to have pieces of the egg mixture, let it sit for a minute or two before stirring."

Blend (or mash if you don't have a handmixer).  Season as you like, and eat.  So yummy.  Another easy one is salsa chicken.  Add chicken breasts or thighs to the crockpot with a jar of salsa.  Cook on low for 5 hours.  Chicken can be used for burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, enchiladas, etc.  You can also substitute lean pork or beef.

1200isplenty,35sjia,parannoyedandroid,6,Wed May 13 16:38:25 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel any better, I only eat once a day in the evening - I'll usually make food that comes out to 1000 - 1300 calories and eat once when I get home from work, and again three or four hours later. Sometimes I'll just eat one meal at 8 or 9pm (but I don't go to bed until 2am.)  Then I don't eat again until after work the next day. It's just intermittent fasting - it's not bad for you, you're still getting the right amount of calories just in a smaller window of your day. The rest of the time that you're not spending eating, your body is running off of that food and after about twelve hours of not eating you start burning fat (if you have fat to lose.)  If you're already at a healthy weight and aren't trying to lose weight, you can still do this and be okay but generally you'll lose some muscle mass."
1200isplenty,35sjia,parannoyedandroid,3,Wed May 13 07:01:21 2015 UTC,That is so interesting. What are some of the meals you'll make?
1200isplenty,35sjia,parannoyedandroid,2,Wed May 13 09:14:20 2015 UTC,"Let's see. Last week I made a tomato, red onion, and goat cheese bruschetta. The bread was 560 calories, the cheese was 280 - the tomato/ onion salad was very low cal and I had a couple slices of salami as well. I had enough calories left over to have a 6oz glass of milk closer to bed time (which I consider a nice snack.)  Sometimes I'll have Chipotle for dinner which comes to about 1050 calories.  Last week I made a fajita steak with veggies, homemade guac, refried beans, and a tomato salad. The entire thing ended up being ~900 calories which gave me room to have a small dessert.  Some of the frozen pasta meals for two people at the grocery store are like ~400 calories for two bowls. I'll eat one bowl after work, the other later in the evening,  with calories left over for a salad or some fruit, or both. OR sometimes I make my own pasta :p  This weekend I really wanted this sandwich from Panera - but it's like a 900 calorie sandwich and not very filling. I went to the store, bought my own ingredients to dupe it. The sandwiches were like 500 calories each, twice the size of the Panera one, and a third of the cost over all.   Just a couple examples. Another one of my favorite meals is 1 can of Southwest veggie soup split into to servings - I'll have each serving with an organic vegetarian burrito (Annie's makes them). The soup is 130 calories, the burritos are each 290 + 40cal sour cream and 15cal of salsa. So under 900 calories for two servings of soup + burrito.  Feasibly for a lot of these I could just have half the meal for lunch and half for dinner but that misses the point of fasting all together.  Basically with this method I can eat whatever I want and not feel bad because its actually extremely challenging to eat over 1200 calories in a ~4 hour period because I'm very full. The next day can be a challenge sometimes but i just sip water or unsweetened tea/ coffee at work and it's become easier and easier to make it to dinner time without eating."

I rinse and toss them for probably 45 seconds or so until I can't smell the initial smell any longer. Then, I pre-heat a non-stick pan for a minute or two to get it nice and warm, add a quick spray of cooking spray, and cook them for probably 7 - 10 minutes, tossing occasionally. In the last minute or so, I add in about 2 tbsp of whatever sauce I am using for the stir fry (Teriyaki, Kung Pao, etc.) and toss them until fully coated, and cook for another minute in the sauce.

Rinse them and add whatever flavors you normally like.  A boullion cube is great, or rotisserie seasoning.  Soy sauce is also good.  Can you tell I like salt?  I like a little crunch too, so 1/2 oz of roasted pumpkin seeds are great.  Also, mushrooms, if you are looking for all the bulk.  Any veggies and/or lean meat do well too.  Stir fry is tasty, but it's easy to end up with too much oil in it for calorie purposes.  The shirataki comes as pearls too, and can sub for rice."

They aren't as delicious as the real thing, at least not to me, but they're so easy and they're a nice sub if you ever feel like you've been overdoing it on bread & sugar.....which is definitely me, right now:    7-8 egg whites  1 tablespoon coconut milk   In a bowl, whisk together egg whites and coconut milk. Heat a small (10 inch) skillet over medium heat, coat lightly with coconut oil. Add just enough egg mixture to coat the pan in a very thin layer, about 1/8 to 1/6 of a cup.

1200isplenty,35m0rp,latteteen,3,Mon May 11 22:39:37 2015 UTC,Check the recipe cards at your store. The light no longer comes with drizzle. You can also see this by looking at the modifiers on the POS when you input the drink. There is no CR Drizz in gray in the custom box for the light but there is for the regular.

Our SMs don't sit us down personally to let us know that CR is no longer included on top of the CRFL, and since most are going to go off of what they know already the recipe cards and POS aren't something they look at. Even though we should keep up to date with this stuff and it was probably mentioned on a Summer 1 promo/portal announcement/flyer hanging up in the back room, a lot of the baristas will just skim over the info. So although that part of the recipe has changed, I'd advise anyone ordering to specify no drizzle to avoid that awkward confrontation at the hand off because the vast majority of the baristas will be going off of what they already know.

1200isplenty,35m0rp,SrirachaPants,3,Mon May 11 20:06:53 2015 UTC,"Light gets a ""light base"" which is just a reduced calorie version of the normal coffee/cream base. Only the coffee fraps have the option of the light base, if you ask for a strawberries & Creme frap light, you'll still get the full sugar base. You can ask for the light base, it really won't make a difference in flavor. Light base has about 33 calories per pump (3,4,5 pumps for T,G,V sizes) and regular base has about 55 (3,4,5).

Whip cream and drizzle are not able to be measured in that way so you can't ever know for sure.

SF cinnamon dolce/hazelnut/caramel/vanilla... all good options. if you're not into coffee, the coconut milk tastes great by itself and with a pump of the syrups. (iced tall sugar-free-syrup coconut milk/ iced tall skinny vanilla/hazelnut/cinnamon dolce coconut milk latte)  the refreshers are also good, they're caffeinated juice so they'll give you the perk of coffee but don't taste like it. i'm not sure the calorie count but for a tall it should be around 40 calories for a cool lime (berry hibiscus and valencia orange are more than likely the same). try substituting the water for lemonade in the cool lime... it's very mojito like and will probably be under 100 calories as well. (iced tall no water sub lemonade cool lime refresher)  the iced teas are great too. we don't sweeten the actual tea, but it's standard to add classic syrup if not otherwise specified (we generally ask ""sweetened or unsweetened""). the teas are brewed at like 2-3x strength, which is why we cut them with water so it's not as concentrated. i recommend an unsweetened green tea/passion tea mix, i add my own splenda or sweet & low. it'll be about 5 calories max considering tea is mainly water. (iced * size * unsweetened no water passion tea green tea mix).  tea lattes are always good if you want something hot. earl grey tea latte is one of my favorites (order with no vanilla syrup). we just steam milk over brewed tea. i suggest it with soy although the soy has 130 calories per cup. toggle with your milk calories, a tall should be about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of steamed milk. (tall no vanilla soy earl grey tea latte)  cold brew is always a good option. less bitter than regular iced coffee and is a lot smoother. again, i prefer the coconut milk with it but even with cream or milk it'll be under 100 calories. comes unsweetened by default but we will probably ask you anyways. (iced grande unsweetened milk choice cold brew)  if you have a little over 100 calories to spare try out this drink: iced tall no water sub strawberry puree valencia orange refresher. it's amazing, especially for summer. i don't know the calories of the strawberry puree off the top of my head but the refresher is about 40 and if i had to guess, i would put a tall of this drink at around 100-130. over estimation is a safe bet.   hope this helped!"

To answer your questions:   Yes the refresher is normally a concentrated juice and is cut with water.  Yes, and it's hard to guess a steady amount because we measure off of a shaker cup. I tried to google a picture of it for you but couldn't find one. When I go into work tomorrow I'll take a picture of it and do some measuring. Yes, it's normal to charge for the puree. If it's not standard in the drink recipe, it will be an upcharge. This is why you won't be charged for syrups when you order an iced coffee, but you will when ordering an espresso beverage. As well, when you substitute lemonade or puree in another drink you'll be charged 60 cents. When you substitute the soy or coconut milk in a drink more than 4 oz, you will be charged 60 cents for the milk. This is why you aren't charged for the milk (or shouldn't be) when ordering iced or hot coffees, tea, or (plain) espresso shots.

I couldn't find exact nutrition information on the strawberry purée by itself, so for that I apologize.  However, I took the calories (290) from a tall no whip strawberries and cream frappuccino (uses 4 oz of strawberry purée), and subtracted the 110 calories of sugar base, 50 calories of whole milk, and 80 calories of simple syrup and was left with 50 calories of strawberry purée.

In fact you can substitute any thin syrup in iced coffee like Vanilla, Hazelnut, Sugar Free Caramel and others for the same price since it's the same as Classic.

If it sounds intense, it's because it was. I saw the progress I saw because I created a really large caloric deficit. Numbers like BMR and TDEE are really broad estimates, and individuals can vary quite a bit.   tl;dr If you aren't losing weight at 1200 calories and you are meticulous about weighing and tracking, you need to create a larger caloric deficit. The safest way to do that is to not eat back any exercise calories (but don't take this advice if doing so causes you to feel weak or light headed)."

It acts as a sort of re-boost to your hormone levels and you'll experience some pretty abrupt weight loss over the next week or so.

Response to weight loss of article  Leptin:       Dieters who lose weight, particularly those with an overabundance of fat cells, experience a drop in levels of circulating leptin. This drop causes reversible decreases in thyroid activity, sympathetic tone, and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle, and increases in muscle efficiency and parasympathetic tone. The result is that a person who has lost weight below their natural body fat set-point has a lower basal metabolic rate than an individual at the same weight who is of that natural weight; these changes are leptin-mediated, homeostatic responses meant to reduce energy expenditure and promote weight regain as a result of fat cells being shrunken below normal size. Many of these changes are reversed by peripheral administration of recombinant leptin to restore pre-diet levels.      Interesting: Leptin receptor | Teleost leptins | Jeffrey M.

Yesterday was a prime example because I finished out at about 1000 because I had a carb-heavy dinner and filled me up fast. Today I feel fine, but I'm going to make sure I eat a little extra today to balance it out. I think one day like that is not bad, just try not to make it a habit. I'd start bringing some extra snacks to work. I like green apples and will try and eat ~100 cals worth of those a day. Just look at your overall trends and make sure there's not more than 1 day a week dipping below 1200."

I would be cautious if you're adding ice and would suggest small matches the first few times to see how your food processor works.  For protein powder, most come with their own scoops but it might be buried in the bottom. I think a cup would be entirely too much. Mine says a 30g scoop is a serving.

It's got 120 calories, 21 g protein.  For a long time after going vegan I sort of bought into the idea that protein wasn't actually as important to get as people rant about, that the RDA amounts of protein were too high, that I was getting enough protein without having to pay attention, etc.  Then I started having some health issues, did some more research, and now protein is what I concentrate on getting the most. It's my most important macro, I feel the best and have the most energy when I get a lot of it. It makes breakfast go a lot farther.  Protein blends like pea and soy are the easiest way to get the most protein so they're my go to breakfast. I also like tofurkey products... high in protein and low on time to cook them."

The red lettuce (radicchio?) goes bad quickly, usually within a few days, so use that first. I've made a salad of that, arugula (which is also in your mix), and pears that was really good. It has a great contrast between the peppery greens and the sweet pears, I also popped in a few crumbles of blue cheese and a few nuts instead of using dressing.  The spinach can be wilted into any recipe, and is great with eggs or pasta.  You might even be able to steam it and freeze it. You can with fully grown spinach, so your mileage may vary with the ""baby"" version. Though even without cooking it'll keep the longest.   It looks like there's one more type of lettuce in there that I can't identify, maybe a baby romaine? Anything green and leafy like that is good on sandwiches, or similar. I, personally, actually prefer spring mix on sandwiches because it adds more flavor than iceberg. I'll also tear it up and mix it with canned tuna to add volume when I'm craving tuna salad."

1200isplenty,35eko1,HarunAlMalik,2,Sat May 9 22:38:47 2015 UTC,"It is rather the opposite. Starvation mode happens once you hit such a low bodyfat that the only fat left is essential to survive which is about <4% for men, <10% in women. This would be what you see in holocaust survivors and people from hunger-stricken areas on the news. The body at this point shuts down some processes to burn less calories. Unless you look like a walking corpse already, it will not happen. Bodybuilders using lots of drugs also hit this bodyfat during peak competition form sometimes.  On the other hand 1200 is actually too little for somebody who weights 300+lbs, but that is because their BMR(basal metabolic rate)  is 2000+ and they would lose weight even at that count assuming they are not a coma patient. They would lose weight at 1200 as well, very rapidly. But it would be unhealthy as they would not get all the required nutrients.  Note that the BMR will decrease as weight loss happens, and at a merely obese BMI of 30 (205lbs), your sister in law would have a BMR of ~1600. While at a maximum healthy weight of 169 at 25 bmi, your inlaw would have a BMR of 1526. The BMR is a good guideline for the minimum you should eat per day to stay fairly healthy unless you are already nearing underweight. Eating at BMR will cause weight loss for most people unless they are bed-stricken as it is an estimation of the calories burned at complete rest for the entire day. Any activity will increase your calories burned.  These numbers will change slightly with age. You did not specify, so I used an age of 35."

Ok it's not healthy and full of fiber and stuff,  you  make it from cake mix and a diet soda. You need 13X9 pan, cake mix of your choice (for a brownie obviously chocolate is the way to go), a diet soda (I like to use diet sprite but you could use anything just remember it adds it's taste to the batter), and cooking spray.   Spray your pan, in a bowl mix the cake mix and a can of diet soda or measure out 12oz. if you are using a 2 liter. Then you just put it in your pan and bake following the directions on the box. It's not as firm as a cake made with eggs and oil, it's got a really moist consistency and it's a little flat. Aside from that it is soooo good. The Betty Crocker Devil's Food mix comes in at 160 calories a piece but that's dividing the pan into 10 pieces. If you divide it into 12, which is what I usually do, that brings it down to 133 a piece. So not too bad. If you look around in your cake mixes you might find some even lower cal."

Their texture is a bit different from regular bagels but it's still good. The 100-calorie bagels are intended to be closer in texture to regular bagels I think.

Quesadillas are easy, and you can add scrambled eggs from the microwave. I really like the single serving steamer bags of vegetables, and all you have to add to them i is a protein to get a complete meal. One option would be to buy a rotisserie chicken and eat it for a couple meals with steamed vegetables or a salad.

Add turkey bacon, cherry tomatoes, toast, scallions, or frozen veggies, etc and serve with reduced sugar ketchup.  Comes to about 150 cal?  This can also be made in a cup for on-the-go convenience."

1200isplenty,3530q3,RuthStPenis,32,Wed May 6 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"If you've ever watched my 600lb life on TLC, the bariatric doctor on that show actually puts the super morbidly obese people on a 1,000 cal/day diet.  They have to prove to him they can lose weight before he will do the surgery, because if they can't change their habits and lose weight on their own, the  surgery will not help them at all. (best case, they eat a TON of small meals a day and stay the same or gain weight, worst case they eat more than they should at one time and cause serious complications).  He usually asks them to lose 50lbs in a month before doing the surgery, but really he is happy with just about any weight loss around/over 20lbs.  Also, people who are really big lose weight much faster (after surgery he expects a 50lb a month loss until they get closer to a normal weight).  It takes a TON of calories to keep a body at 600 lbs (or even 400lbs) and in the beginning the weight comes of quite quickly as long as the person sticks to the very low calorie and almost no carb diet prescribed.  The fattest woman in the world lost around 700lbs in two years! (that's about a pound a day for two years).  At the end of those two years she was around 300lbs or so, and still losing, but not nearly as fast."

I'm heading home next week, and I have a doctor appointment then. I talked to my doctor yesterday and told him about my weight loss and he didn't say it was unhealthy, as long as I'm eating healthy and not starving myself. It took a few days to learn that it was okay to feel hunger, considering I was eating like 3500-4000 per day before I decided to care about my life (sounds heavy (no pun intended) but I don't mean it that way), but since then I've been pretty much satisfied with each meal/snacks.

It was such a weird thing, to realize I'd been over-eating so much I hadn't felt hunger in a very long time.  What I thought was hunger was actually boredom and me going, ""Oh, I haven't eaten in x hours, maybe I should"" even when I didn't need it.  A fortunate problem to have, but not a healthy one!

Probably won't be an issue for you just yet, but I've hit this wall before and, not knowing what caused a month long+ plateau, made me practically give up. At least now I know this time around.  Good article about this phenomenon by Lyle McDonald here.  Whatever you do, make sure you get adequate protein intake and keep up the weightlifting. I've seen big guys drop a ton of weight plenty of times, and the absolute best results were the ones who were lifting the whole time while doing so.

1200isplenty,3530q3,lizzievicarious,5,Wed May 6 22:37:06 2015 UTC,Congrats. Remember that when you workout your body burns calories and needs to refuel. I would suggest eating a little more than 1200 calories on days you have an intense workout or else your body will eventually give out. Also go to your nearest Vitamin Shoppe and invest in some daily multivitamins and glutamine/bcaa powder to mix in with water after an intense workout. Helps your muscles build.
1200isplenty,3530q3,reyggg,4,Wed May 6 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Question about the intensity of workouts; is it considered more intense if I have to catch my breath after? I've been moving 60lb buckets of paint to and from trucks and not felt out of breath, but when I jog for 2 minutes I feel like death. And I hadn't thought about the vitamin supplements, I'll look into that.  Also I mentioned somewhere else, I've been having more like 15-1600 per day, I know I'm a bigger body so I need a few more calories than yall little people"
1200isplenty,3530q3,dietbroccoli,4,Wed May 6 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"I started my weight lose journey about 4 months ago. I started at 390 and have had tremendous results. You don't have to tell me about bigger body. I apologize I didn't see where you mentioned you eat 15-1600 cals a day.   Jogging with your body will make you feel like death. A more intense workout is a workout that lasts any longer 45 minutes and you are pushing your body, specifically your muscles, to the max. I recommend mixing weight training and cardio into your training at least 3 times a week.   So I follow a pretty strict diet that my trainer gave me. I workout with him 3 times a week and do my own thing the other 4. Before I work out I drink one bottle of water mixed with this. I then have my workout which is usually around an hour and a half. Then I have another water bottle filled with this (something different than previous).   Changing your diet is extremely important to losing weight and body fat. Please consider doing weight training 3 times a week if you already don't. It helps reduce body fat. I eat about 6 servings of vegetables a day. Learn to love vegetables. I only eat chicken and fish (salmon). I treat red meat as a luxury and have it once a week, usually Saturday night (BBQ Season!). While we need the nutrients in red meat to survive, too much of it is not good for you. I only eat good carbs and I eat very small portions of them with my first and last meal only. Sweet potatoes, quinoa, and brown rice are the best good carbs you can eat.   Please feel free to ask any questions you want. I really am happy with what I have done over the past 4 months and wish that people could feel the same. If you want to keep chatting feel free to pm me or keep typing here. I am also happy to share workout routines or help you create one."

All I wanted was a simple, one-week online food calendar! (If you ever find one, please let me know haha!) So I scoured the local Dollar Tree and found a small, magnetic whiteboard with the days of the week on it and made my own that sits on the fridge. I can plan out a week's worth of different meals, make sure I carry over leftovers/veggies/sauces for new meals so no food goes to waste, and I get awesome variety...then at the end of the week, I wipe it all away & start over!  As far as tracking your nutritional info, using M.F.P. is a definite lifesaver. I personally don't like using it to make a 'meal-plan' because I can't view it in a weekly calendar (or if there is, I haven't figured it out yet).

Basically congee is the ultimate Asian version of sick food - better than chicken soup.   I have a cold and it does wonders to keep me warm especially in this wretched rainy weather!  Basic recipe (serves 2):   1/2 cup long or short grain brown rice 4-4 and a half cups water or stock (depending on your preference of consistency, basically a 1:8 brown rice to water ratio, less if you're using white rice) OPTIONAL: knob of ginger (I didn't have any or else this would be a must for a sickie) and garlic   Put rice and water/stock in a heavy bottomed pot and ginger if using, and bring to the boil.   Once boiling, turn heat to a low simmer and cover halfway for 1/2-2 hours until the congee achieves desired consistency.   If water evaporates, add more in.   Here I added 145g of choy sum once the congee was cooked and allowed it to wilt.   Once cooked, ladle into two bowls and top with garnishes such as soy sauce, sesame oil, lots of white pepper, garlic flakes, dried onion.... And/or eat it as a side to your stir fry!"

Nearly any normal recipe can be made lower sodium if you make it at home, without using prepackaged stuff. The only things that (I personally) add salt to for my own eating is rice (IF I'm eating it plain, otherwise I let the other ingredients flavor it instead). You can reduce the amount of salt you're using by ramping up the other ingredients. Try a splash of vinegar, a sprinkle of dill or a bit of diced garlic/garlic powder instead. This will work for most everything but it does take a bit of getting used to.   Depending on how much sodium you get atm, be careful with lowering the amount. Generally humans need 1500-2300mg/day, more if they are involved in anything that causes sweating (including stuff like going to the beach, exercising or working in a hot environment). Not getting enough can cause everything from muscle cramps (which suck) to seizures (which suck even more)."

Ingredients:  1 onion, chopped  A box of mushrooms, chopped as thinly as possible  Like 6 or 7 Campari tomatoes, cut into quarters  1 red bell pepper, chopped as thinly as possible  1 bag of baby spinach  1 thing of broccoli, chopped as thinly as possible  2 tablespoons of olive oil  Whole cabbage  2-3 cloves of garlic, minced  Tools:  1 big pot  2 medium-ish pots  A pan  Recipe:  Put onion in a big pot with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and caramelize on low/medium heat, stirring occasionally.   Take cabbage and separate leaves gently, trying to preserve them as much as possible. I ended up using way less than a whole cabbage, but I also lost a lot of leaves in the process of boiling, draining, and separating them, so don't stop when you think you have enough leaves. Do the whole cabbage or as close to it as you have patience for. I did about 3/4. Fill the bottom 2 inches of the big pot with water, put the cabbage in, medium heat, cover, and forget about it for a half an hour. Then turn heat off and drain.  Put tomatoes in the smaller of the two medium pots, medium heat, and stir occasionally. Once this looks pretty much completely liquid and sort of homogeneous, add the pepper and some salt. Keep stirring. Give it a few more minutes, then add a clove of garlic. Some oregano wouldn't hurt either.  When the onions are golden, add mushrooms, another tablespoon of oil, and increase the heat a tiny little bit. Add one or two of the garlic cloves now. Keep stirring.  When the mushrooms are shrunken and look ready, and the tomato mixture has been bubbling for a little while and looks ready, add the tomatoes to the onion and the mushrooms and stir. Now is the time to add the broccoli (which should be almost powder-like). Keep stirring.  In the pot where the tomatoes used to be, put all the baby spinach and turn the heat to medium. Just leave it there for a few minutes until it looks ready, then add it to the mixture. Keep stirring and let the whole thing cook together for another 10 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 350F.   Now start layering your sauce with the cabbage leaves in between. I found that this was much easier with cabbage leaves than actual lasagna leaves. Let the leaves overlap a lot, and if you have enough good ones feel free to make each cabbage layer 2 leaves thick. I started with cabbage, had two layers of sauce in the middle, and a thin layer of sauce at the top. Then I sprinkled about 55 grams of mozzarella cheese on top of that.  This received rave reviews from people who don't give a fuck about calories. It also made the whole house smell like pizza."

This happened to me for a while when I was eating really close to my TDEE. I was losing about two pounds a month, but it all came at once. I'd stay steady for three weeks, then lose two pounds overnight during my period. Then I'd stay there until my next period. It was a little frustrating, but predictable as hell.  My advice?

Credit goes to Nikki Cascone, who made this recipe on season 4 of Top Chef, haha! It's a one-pot meal, which was what made me try it for the first time.  My favorite thing about it? The apples. The sweetness of apples pairs so perfectly with chicken and pork, but I never would have thought to put them in this dish!  Also, this reheats wonderfully in the oven, but of course it'll do fine in a microwave as well.  All the steps are inside the album, but here are the full ingredients list and directions:  Roasted Chicken with Apples & Mixed Vegetables  Ingredients   5 chicken thighs (drumsticks also work well) Salt and pepper to taste, as well as any other spices you like 1 tbsp oil 4 large carrots, cleaned and chopped 6 garlic cloves, diced 1 large yellow onion, julienned 1 large apple, chopped 1 lb Brussels sprouts, halved 2/3 lb potatoes, chopped thyme (fresh or dried is fine); other good herbs to use are rosemary and basil   Directions   Season the chicken with salt and pepper and spices. Sear in hot pan to brown outside and place in the oven (pan should be large enough to hold all of the chicken and all of the vegetables). Bake at 375 degrees. Vegetables will cook in varying times, so be aware not to add them too early or they will overcook. When chicken is in the oven for 15 minutes, add the carrots, potatoes, and garlic. After another 15 minutes, add onions, apples, and Brussels sprouts. Season the vegetables with salt, pepper, and thyme. Vegetables and chicken should be fully cooked in 45 minutes but check the thighs to make sure.

A 1 tbsp serving is 51 calories, and it's a bit thick because of the relatively small amount of olive oil.  Kind of like pesto.  If you don't think you'll use it all at once, you can freeze it in an ice cube tray and store in an airtight container.  I got 8 servings out of this batch and froze 6 of them for later."

Make sure you wash them thoroughly.  It could also be some quirk specific to you--allergies or something, maybe?

The poor man buys a $10 pair of cheap, low quality shoes, because that's all he can afford, but then the shoes wear out so quickly that he buys a $10 pair of shoes every month. The rich man buys a $100 pair of quality shoes, and they last him three years. It's unfair because the poor man eventually spends more than the rich man, but that is the high price of being poor.  Unfortunately, this is also how it works with blenders. Cheap blenders are truly awful, they break so easily and they're not really all that great at cutting anything up. You will never, ever get a beautifully smooth, pure consistency with a cheap blender. Now, this DOESN'T MEAN you have to save up for the holy grail of blenders (like a $400 Vitamix), but since it's not a super essential item for your kitchen, I'd recommend saving up for at least a mid level Ninja blender ($150-$199). Otherwise, especially if you really start blending stuff on a regular basis, you're just buying $10 shoes.

If you want to make more liquidy things like smoothies though, a blender is the best choice (in a food processor it will just splash up and leak out, as there's no vortex created to suck it down like in a blender). I'd say saving up for a good one is the best idea, we've had some crappy blenders that wouldn't blend a (not frozen) banana before.  Another cheaper option is an immersion blender, which is a handheld stick shaped one. That's good for soups, because blending hot soup in a regular blender is risky business.

Did you leave your steak a little rare? Then it'll be a lot heavier than if you made it well-done (due to moisture evaporating out of it the longer you cook it)."

It never went away until I tried witchdoctoring on the internets, disregarding gallbladder cleanses and other dangerous stuff.

I know it sounds like bogus and I was skeptical too but for me it was either surgery I cannot afford or trying what I can. And at least for me it helped. I did an elimination diet to find out if it was maybe food intolerance, cut out caffeine, did almost no fat, nothing made a difference, until the vinegar. It also helped with the symptoms shortly after ingesting it right away. Feeling overall better took about two weeks.

Total is 1767 calories, and it weighed out to about 1100 grams, so that's 1.6 calories per gram for the filling.  Putting it together:   4 small-medium zucchinis, sliced in half and seeds scooped out (about 15 calories per half) crumbled feta cheese (15-20 calories per tablespoon)  Fill each zucchini half with a bunch of meat stuff, then put the rest of the meat mix in the fridge or freezer for another time. Top with a tablespoon of feta and bake 15-25 minutes at 375. For mine, it worked out to about 75 grams of filling (75 grams times 1.6 calories per gram = 120 calories) per boat, so my total per serving is 155 calories.  Two of these with a nice veggie salad makes a pretty good dinner for <400 calories."

At 1200 calories and at your weight, you're already eating far below your tdee, so you will lose weight quickly, maybe even too quickly. When you add working out on top of it, yes you'll lose more even faster, but it is VERY unhealthy. Soon you'll likely experience your hair falling out more often, maybe a little dizziness, lack of energy, your period might stop completely  (which sounds better than it is), kidney problems, hearty problems. It's dangerous. If you feel like working out is keeping you moving the right direction then do that, but you really need to up your calories to at least 1400 (reassess a real number using the sidebar links) maybe more some days off your body tells you that you need more."

Cauliflower is good at pretending to be a carb, I realized. And how else can I take advantage of this? Yesterday I decided: Granola bars!  In hindsight, this was a terrible idea. Yes, you can bake cauliflower until it's crunchy. And yes, you can boil and mash it into a paste. But it lacks that certain je ne sais quoi that makes oats simultaneously chewy and crunchy, sweet and salty, and also it doesn't go so well with cinnamon.   I mixed almonds, walnuts, pb2, raisins, honey, cinnamon, and an egg white in a bowl, first weighing everything carefully. I chopped up a cauliflower and baked it until crunchy. I mixed it all together and tossed it in the oven. My diet has 90 calories budgeted for a daily snack (I've been eating bacon or pb2), so I was happy when the calculations showed that the ""bars"" are only 75 calories apiece.  It actually smelled really good. My roommate walked by the kitchen while it was in the oven and went ""mmmmmmm"". I was optimistic up until the first bite. I initially gave it 5/10, but after my friend spit his into the trash and my roommate refused to even try it, I had to downgrade to 1/10. It had a similar texture to apple crumble, but it tasted like the apples were soaked in poison first.   Anyway, thought I'd share. In the spectrum of my failed kitchen experiments, I'd put this one right between the revolting tomato fish stew from a few months ago and the first time I (overcooked) chicken. I think I'm gonna stay away from cauliflower for a little while."

After all, you can only eat so much volume in one sitting. I have trouble hitting 1200 sometimes even when I'm at a burger/hot dog joint or pizza place. (Obviously if I really sat down and devoted my attention to eating, I could polish 1500 cals or so, but if I'm eating at a normal pace, I'll get full at ~600-900 cals.)  I think things like fattier meats (pork, salmon, etc) are a green light as well as heavier condiments, pastas, nut butters, etc.  You can prep pasta salads, potato salads, taco meat (chicken or ground beef) used in different ways (burrito, burrito bowl with lots of condiments, tacos, with rice, etc), sandwiches (and calorie rich condiments like pesto mayo are probably a green light), and heavier milkshakes (whole milk, whole Greek yogurt, almond butter, fruits, protein powder). Basically look for meal prep ideas in normal subs."

When I first tried this strategy I was skeptical because I was worried I'd end up overeating at night anyway and just be over by that much more, but it's worked super well. Lots of research supports this too: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/oby.2002.13/full Make sure that you have reasonable snacks at home. You probably can't curb snacking 100%, but if your readily accessible options aren't too caloric, you won't do much damage. Just go to bed earlier.

Ultimately, the quickest way to eliminate a craving is by making it impossible to satisfy.  A different little trick could be to start thinking of your calorie ""days"" differently.

Unfortunately all we had was Costco bacon which isn't the healthiest choice, but it's been so long since I had bacon that I'm not too worried!  311 cal: 24g of protein, 23g of carbs, 13.5g of fat"
1200isplenty,34amwr,thirdham,2,Wed Apr 29 17:10:17 2015 UTC,Escargot tastes like mushrooms?!?!?! This may change my life. For some reason my body gets violently ill if I ingest mushrooms but the foods I do end up accidentally eating that have them taste AMAZING (just not coming back up) and I have been sad that there was nothing I could eat with that taste. I may have to find me some snails!
1200isplenty,34amwr,thirdham,3,Thu Apr 30 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the texture is quite similar, and mushrooms and escargot don't really have too much flavour on their own, so I'd say it's definitely worth giving it a try - all the stores I've seen sell a can of ~45-50 for like two bucks, so you won't go broke giving them a chance :)"

Keep all of the cheese, cause.. obviously. Yum. Chop up a zucchini into little bite sized chunks. Throw it into the water to boil for a little while with the pasta. When it's all done, drain most of the water, but keep a little bit. Like, drain it without a colander (just out of the side of the pot) and don't worry about getting the last bit of water out. Immediately throw in the packet of cheese, sprinkling it in a little at a time as you stir it. Don't add milk or butter. Just as is. The hot water will help it to coat the pasta and zucchini. Once it's all stirred in well, cover the pot and let it sit for a minute or two. This will help it get really melty and just.. done. You could probably skip this step. Pour into a bowl, cover with a shitload of black pepper (if you're like me) and eat. Super delicious. I sometimes add spinach if I have some handy too. I just throw it in raw when I'm adding the cheese and it wilts perfectly on its own."

White Cheddar Corn Puffs are from Trader Joe's. I also cooked up some braised short ribs and a chickpea stew for this week's lunches.   Monday:   The cream cheese was a seasonal product from Trader Joe's and I'm almost out :'( Spicy Chickpea Stew recipe is from here, although I subbed sweet potato for butternut squash, and used diced tomatoes with tomato sauce because I didn't want to buy a big can of crushed tomatoes. I also left out a couple of ingredients, the harissa and parsley. Braised Short Ribs recipe is from here, although I left out the port and used all red wine instead, and put in a ton less olive oil. Dinner was a lot of food for 280 calories! The cod I rubbed with different spices and cooked on the stove in some bacon fat.   Tuesday:   Fig butter is from Trader Joe's. I sprinkled some edible flowers over it because...I'm not sure why I bought them in the first place and they were starting to dry up. Yay, Dave's Killer Bread now makes thin-sliced lower calorie bread! I got their Powerseed, which is 60 calories per slice. I mixed avocado and sun-dried tomato pesto together and spread it on top. I wanted to make an open-faced sandwich with the bread but also had to use up the rest of yesterday's cod fillet, so I wrapped the cod in bacon and baked it in the oven. Baked for about 15 minutes at 425, then I took it out and seared it quickly in the pan, just to crisp up the bacon. Plopped it on top of sliced radishes, spinach, and the bread.

This is what a typical day looks like for me. My hope is that someone might find some inspiration, or an ""Ah Ha"" moment somewhere to help them along their way! I would love to answer questions or give more ideas if anyone wants them!    My typical day:    I eat my ""breakfast"" around 8am, the coffee takes me a couple of hours to finish. The bagel thins are AWESOME for people like me who just crave pastries and other carb heavy breakfasts. And I found some greek yogurt cream cheese with twice as much protein as the regular stuff, so it helps keep me fuller longer.    Around 11 I have my ""snack,"" and the Kashi Go Lean! brand has been Awesome. It's packed with protein (11g for 1/2 a cup of cereal!) and it's crunchy and sweet, which are two of my major cravings.    Lunch usually happens around 2-ish. This salad is about 5 cups of food!! It's super flavorful with the sour cream and salsa (usually I use less sour cream but I got carried away yesterday...) and it's packed with protein to keep me going until dinner.    After work I like to go for a 30-40 minute run, which keeps my net calories under 1200 a day.    I try to center dinner around a lean meat (steak/fish/poultry) and the sides are a steamed veggie and a protein-rich complex carb like quinoa or brown rice.    Last night I made seared Ahi Tuna. I'd found a 20oz tuna steak at Costco on Sunday and had never made tuna before. It is not a staple in my house, lol. Costco also has frozen, microwaveable quinoa that's been seasoned and has chopped kale in it. It's a perfect side dish and literally takes 5 minutes to prepare. For the veggies I usually rotate between broccoli with bell peppers or green beans alone. Every so often I'll make brussel sprouts for the BF.     I always, always leave some room for dessert every night. I recently bought a Yonanas!, which is just as ridiculous as it sounds, but banana ice cream is incredibly satisfying. I mix in peanut butter, nutella, semi-sweet mini morsels, pretty much whatever I can find that fits in the calories I have left.

I suggest investing in a heart rate monitor to see how much you burn during exercise, while at the same time increasing your intake because if you do not increase you will suffer serious physical and psychological repercussions.   Think of it like this: weight loss and maintenance is a lifestyle change, not a diet. If you only do it temporary (diet), it won't work.   Can you honestly see yourself living off of such few calories for the rest of your life? You can't.   As for the weight loss stalling, it could be a variety of things. Do you weigh your food? It gives a more accurate picture of caloric amount.   Perhaps you're retaining water or glycogen; the scale can stall for weeks sometimes (seriously).   Just be patient and avoid doing anything drastic--weight loss is a saunter not a sprint (and it stays off better like that)."
1200isplenty,34apxc,linkedhorizon,-5,Wed Apr 29 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"I could see myself eating like this for the rest of my life. I feel sick if i eat more. The quantity of what I've eaten hasn't changed, just what I'm eating.   I weigh out everything and have a pretty good grasp on how many calories I'm taking in, when I was on 900 calories I was losing a decent amount of weight a week so I'm just not understanding why when I try to be healthier I'm gaining weight. Its been a consistent .2 pounds a day.   I understand everything on paper, it makes sense. My bodies reaction to this however isn't making sense to me."
1200isplenty,34apxc,thepersonwiththeface,6,Wed Apr 29 18:42:58 2015 UTC,"The healthy weightloss rate is ~1-2lbs a week. More than that and you do harm to your body. Eating fewer than 1200cal/day puts you in the risk for malnutrition. The amount of energy you use in a day(taking into account your age/height/weight/gender/and activity levels) is called your TDEE (http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/). If you eat 500 fewer calories than that a day, you will lose about 1lb a week.      Assuming no activity(like a desk job) and an age of 25, you need ~2020 calories a day to maintain the weight you have. Eating 1200 calories a day, you'd lose ~1.6lbs a week. If you were to exercise, you'd of course lose weight quicker, but it really is recommended that you eat back those calories you burn so that you don't damage your body.      If you're unhappy with that answer, you should talk to your doctor/a nutritionist to see about doing something more extreme in a carefully monitored way. The type of damage you could do to your body is the same type you see in anorexics.       You are actually displaying some symptoms of anorexia(not that I'm a doctor or anything, but this isn't the sort of thing you want to mess around with). You were literally starving yourself for a while, so it's going to take some time to get back to feeling okay when eating healthily. To make it easier, try eating more calorie-dense foods, like avocadoes or peanut butter. Look at your macronutrients to see if you're not eating enough or a certain category. If you think you're having issues that could be an eating disorder, please see a doctor.      My best friend developed an eating disorder while trying to lose weight, and it landed her in a mental hospital and with lifelong health issues. This isn't a insignificant thing."

I have so many thoughts about this, but let me preface this with saying that I do not believe it's wrong for people to love their body as is. But lately, I've seen some of the fat acceptance crowd really go out of their way to villainize and victimize women who are active, fit, and thin.   The original ad was not, in my opinion, at all offensive or unfeminist. Its target audience are people who strive for health, fitness, and ""beach bodies"". I don't think that showing a fit woman in a bikini invalidates other women's bodies, as some people argued. Plus, we hear the ""beach body"" rhetoric constantly at this time of year, same with ""lose weight!"" ads around the new year. I have no clue why Protein World's ads stood out as more offensive than the rest. I am irritated by the accusations leveled at the model. That she's starving, that she depicts an unhealthy lifestyle, that she's shaming others just by existing, that trying to improve your body = unhealthy, that ""real women"" don't look like that. Regarding Protein World's social media responses--they reacted in a way that spoke to their target market. They didn't back down or apologize for their ads. Whether or not you agree with them or think they went overboard (I think calling the protesting women ""terrorists"" is ridiculous), but 55k people signing a petition because they got their feelings hurt by a harmless ad is also ridiculous."

Those processed food companies are just like the junk food industry - trying to make $ regardless of quality of product, if it's actually good for consumers, etc. Like, you should know that ""Protein World"" ALSO sells ""slender blend"" pills, which purport to aid weight loss. Pro-tip, they don't work. So I don't like companies like Protein World.   At the same token, I do have some issues with the body acceptance movement and especially with the connection it tries to make with feminism. My feminism doesn't give a shit if one woman is trying to improve her body (or if another woman isn't). And some (not all) in the HAES movement attempt to treat any weight loss like it's the devil's work, which I'm not cool with.   So my 2 cents is that I'm firmly not on either side."

The advert asks if you, the reader, (who could be any gender) if you're beach body ready. It would be sexist if it said something like, ""as a good woman, she's beach body ready! Are you?""   This is a stupid non-controversy, if you see something you don't like, just ignore it. It's not hurting anyone.

Eventually I ended up at 500 a day and I felt so terrible. Hungry, tire and depressed. After 5/6 months,  I did eventually snap out of it, but I still feel awful knowing how much damage I've done to my body.   Nowadays I try to eat 1500 and healthily and hope that the side effects of my unhealthy lifestyle won't linger.

1200isplenty,343ee3,DBuckFactory,27,Tue Apr 28 19:13:21 2015 UTC,"Probably because it wasn't the 1200 that caused problems.  Similar to the OP, dieting set them on a bad path to eating disorders.  While eating disorders are a terrible thing, the blame should not be on a subreddit dedicated to eating 1200 calories per day.    1200 calories is not necessarily unhealthy, even for teens.  If a person has fat stores, the body can easily pull from those fat stores to make up the extra calories and the person will lose weight.  Eating at a moderate deficit will not cause someone to lose their period or have thinning hair.  Binging and purging will do that, however.  Eating 500 calories a day can also cause a lot of problems, especially if the person is active.  So, I think the focus is misplaced on this post.  Rather than ""1200 calories is not for everyone"", the message should be about avoiding eating disorders, which are clearly the culprits in OP's and /u/moonsel's cases."

For example, I've never had problems with disordered eating, but after starting to really follow to this sub, I've started noticing a tendency to want to push it farther. My maintain TDEE would be at 2568, so 1200 is already a 1200+ calorie deficit. the more I research, the more I find it's just not suggested to go much under a 500 calorie deficit, before you start not only losing fat, but muscle too. 1200 is in no way healthy for me as something to do for a long period of time, but looking at the examples here I can con myself into thinking it is."

Like anything else, it's about what's finding what's healthy for you, not just physically, but mentally/psychologically too. Obviously, for these teenage girls this was not healthy in any of those ways, and I think the sub as a community needs to continue to be aware of that risk, if that makes sense.

If you're not going to believe a random person on the internet then believe the medical experts.    Calories serve a very different purpose for teens than adults. Their bodies require extra calories to continue to grow properly.  Adults don't have to worry about that at all - for adults calories are pretty much literally a weight loss or muscle growth resource for us. 1200 is fine for adults, it is not fine for growing teenagers - a teenager will continue to lose weight on a much higher calorie count than that purely because their bodies require so much more than adults to function in a healthy way.

I'm not somebody who will stick to what I believe in the face of actual good information.  A google search gives me tons of opinion blogs, but those are generally ridiculous.  From things that I have found, nothing states that a moderate deficit will cause any problems as long as the right vitamins and nutrients are still being consumed.   Their bodies require extra calories to continue to grow properly.   Luckily, the body has fat stores to provide those calories.  From what you are suggesting, nobody in their teenage years should attempt to eat fewer calories to lose weight.     If you think it is completely false, then you are part of the misinformed population on these subs that are actively providing poor advice to teens.   If you provide information, then I'll listen.  Otherwise, you're stating an opinion and reacting emotionally to something that is obviously caused by eating disorders rather than a moderate deficit.

I shouldn't have to hand-feed you information, nor do I have the time to. (It's pretty hard and time consuming on a tablet.) Pubmed is a decent source but it's actually really difficult to find specific information because the search results are usually so broad.  You should also be able to tell the difference between me saying that teens can lose weight at higher calories than adults, and me saying that teens don't need to lower their calorie intake at all - because I never said that second bit.  The maintenance calories required for teens are higher than that of adults, so they are able to lose weight at lower calorie deficits.  Even adults can lose weight at much higher calorie goals than 1200, but people choose to drop to that amount because it's faster and it's not necessarily unhealthy for an adult."

I clearly stated that I will accept any information that is actually from a scientific study rather than an opinion.  The issue with the information from the NIH is that it is merely guidelines to use and does not say anything negative about having a moderate caloric deficit for weight loss (which was my point).  There are also NIH guidelines that suggest that adult males should consume 2000 calories, but that's obviously hardly true at all.  People should consume calories based on their own metabolic rate and their needs (exercise) and goals (weight loss, muscle gain, maintenance).  So, no, the NIH guidelines do not prove any sort of point.  Regarding everything else you're saying, it doesn't really all mesh with what you were saying before.  Here is what I said, as a quote:   1200 calories is not necessarily unhealthy, even for teens. If a person has fat stores, the body can easily pull from those fat stores to make up the extra calories and the person will lose weight. Eating at a moderate deficit will not cause someone to lose their period or have thinning hair.   Here is your reply:   1200 calories is not healthy for teenagers, period.   A normal person would take this reply to mean that you disagree that a moderate deficit would be detrimental to someone's health.   The maintenance calories required for teens are higher than that of adults, so they are able to lose weight at lower calorie deficits.   Not exactly.  The first part is true, but the second part is 100% false.  It doesn't make sense.  A pound of fat will be burned after the caloric deficit reaches 3500 no matter if that person is a teenager or an adult.     Even adults can lose weight at much higher calorie goals than 1200, but people choose to drop to that amount because it's faster and it's not necessarily unhealthy for an adult.   This is a different point entirely and one that I agree with.  All I ever said is that is isn't necessarily unhealthy for teens to eat at 1200.  I think the hard line of 1200 or 1800 or 2000 are all just guides for healthy people of a normal size.  There are always exceptions and not everybody is at a healthy weight or have the same goals."

That's why there's so many healthy people here who live off of 1200 calories, and they're doing fine; the idea that everyone needs 2000 calories is a little ridiculous.  Still, I urge you to try and get in with a mental health professional, in order for you to better deal with your eating disorder. It's unlikely to go away on its own, and if you don't deal with the underlying issues that caused it to surface in the first place, then you will not get better. It's highly-likely that it will get worse.  Please take care, and I hope you get better."

The communities are awesome but every time a teenager asks for advice while following adult-diets they're given adult-centered answers which end up really being highly unhealthy.  Personally, I feel there should be a pinned thread or a sidebar that has a disclaimer to teenagers because the amount of 15-16 year olds trying to follow 1200 cal diets and still being advised to follow them because people are so uninformed makes me really sad for them.

Nutrition education is SEVERELY lacking, and people simply don't realize that with widely varying sizes and activity levels comes widely varying caloric needs, and your own needs are pretty personal and somewhat unique, and can't be determined by some stranger on the internet who does not know you.  Most people under or overestimate their activity level. The rest is easy to judge and find, but activity matters. There's nothing wrong with a very temporary diet of 1200 calories if it is a severe deficit, but as a lifestyle, like you said, it is ill-advised.

1200isplenty,343ee3,ilikecamelsalot,8,Tue Apr 28 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"nope. Here we learn that    Energy needs for your body's basic functions stay fairly consistent and aren't easily changed.   and   because metabolism is a natural process, your body has many mechanisms that regulate it to meet your individual needs. Only in rare cases do you get excessive weight gain from a medical problem that slows metabolism, such as Cushing's syndrome   and   While you don't have much control over the speed of your basal metabolism, you can control how many calories you burn through your level of physical activity.   And here we learn that   There is such a thing as a slow metabolism. But slow metabolism is rare, and it's usually not what's behind being overweight or obese    and   Several factors determine your basal metabolic rate: Your body size and composition. If you weigh more or have more muscle mass, you will burn more calories, even at rest. So people who weigh more are more likely to have a faster metabolic rate — not a slower one — because a portion of excess weight is muscle tissue. Your sex. If you're a man, you probably have less body fat and more muscle mass than does a woman of the same age, so you burn more calories. Your age. As you get older, your muscle mass decreases, which slows down the rate at which you burn calories.   Notice how none of those things are fasting.   And here we learn that   Your BMR Isn’t Going Anywhere Anytime Soon While total metabolism can change at the drop of a hat, your BMR is like a glacier, moving and changing ever so slowly. Plus it’s important to note that most of the factors that determine your BMR are not something you can intentionally change or control. Your age, gender, height, somatotype, and even genetics all account for the lion’s share of what causes your BMR to be where it is.   By ""total metabolism"" they're referring to how much you burn a day, it's more commonly called your TDEE. You can raise your TDEE by doing a dozen jumping jacks right now.   Your metabolism can be slowed, but only if your god hates you enough to give you a really really awful disease with a zillion symptoms.  If I started eating 3,000 calories a day, at no point will my metabolism ever speed up enough to stop the weight gain. If I start eating 300 calories a day, my metabolism will never slow down enough to stop the weight loss.  Foods and pills that claim to raise your metabolism are lying to you. Why would they do that? Because they know no one ever taught you about nutrition and they want your money.   Starvation mode is also bullshit, btw."

If you feel these thoughts coming back in ANY way, TELL SOMEONE. Please don't be afraid to reach out. A lot of people cannot stomp this out on their own (again, not everyone).

We can't digest uncooked food as easily. Cooking frees up a lot of calories, i.e. cooked foods ""have more"" calories than raw. However, no nutritional information is going to take this into account, so calorie counting is really only ever a rough guideline. There are also a lot of new discoveries around ""resistant starch"", which are starches that can't be digested as easily either because the food is raw or not ripe (e.g. green bananas), or it has been cooked and cooled (leftovers) or some other process has been done (cooking rice with oil in the water, then cooling and reheating has been recently discovered to cut calories significantly)."

I prepped a bunch of ingredients on Sunday, then ate them in different combinations Monday through Friday in an assortment of bowls. I easily get tired of eating the same thing day after day, so this was a great way to introduce a little bit of variety. Besides the initial cooking and setting up in MFP, this was actually a breeze to pull off. I separated ingredients into equal portions, listed every item in MFP and copied to every day of the week, and brought everything to work. Then when I was mix-and-matching my lunch, I would delete the ingredients I wasn't eating. Each bowl came out to about 380-450 calories.  PSA: that Biltong Beef Jerky is from Trader Joe's and bleh, it's not very good. It's very chewy and tough, and I even got a bit of hard cartilage.  Let me know if you have any questions. I didn't use any recipes this week, just threw things together. Everything is pretty much from the farmers market, Trader Joe's, or Fred Meyer/Kroger's.

1200isplenty,33whuj,the-lovely-bows,2,Mon Apr 27 03:51:41 2015 UTC,"I suspect that the rice is cooked with water. It says 20 g dry because that is the weight before it is cooked. After it is boiled, it weighs more, but the dry weight is the most accurate for counting calories."

Let the egg fry a little before you mix, you want the base to be white before you start mixing or it'll just bind all the ingredients together rather than getting the good chunks of egg. Once it's turning white, chop up with your spatula and mix through the rest.  Serve and enjoy! I just realised I put siracha on top, better add that to MFP now :)  Based on this recipe and he's right, it doesn't look pretty but it tastes damn good!"

There's so many different ways to eat it: For a sweet snack, I do cottage cheese + pumpkin pie spice + blackberrys. This legit tastes like a pie. You can use pears/apples and heat the cottage cheese before hand if you like to switch it up.  For a more hearty option, try and omelet with a scoop of cottage cheese in the middle. It melts into the egg like real cheese and is soo good.  My go to is cottage cheese with a sprinkling of dill + cherry tomatoes + a bit of pepper. It's goods with basically any lunch/dinner."
