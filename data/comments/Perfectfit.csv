Perfectfit,3dcuth,Dabbiddeedoodaa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"That might be surprisingly unpleasant, though. The pieces fit so neatly together, they might not have the wiggle room required to ""fold"", so they might mostly insist to stay one wall. Since the same applies to the outer-most places, the whole ""door"" might not move away at all, you might end up running against a wall whose pieces almost don't get displaced. And then you're mainly confronted with the pieces' form-stability, not so much with their lightness."

Perfectfit,3csgq8,LucentPhoenix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"Hm, fair enough.  Alternatively, this arrangement of the days could be explained by not wanting the start of the week to be the bane of everyone's existence. We still have the Monday-Friday work/business week, but for us the standard week begins and ends on a day off.  It's really just semantic, but some sort of psychology like that may partially explain it. To me, looking at a Monday-Sunday calendar feel like ""Hey, we're gonna pound you with work for these five days, and then you get to relax at the end"", whereas with Sunday-Saturday, to me it looks like ""You get a day to relax before you have to work again. It'll get tiresome but just plow through and then Saturday you can start to unwind again"".  To me, the North American layout feels like it's preparing you more for the week ahead, and the other layout feels like the work week would come more suddenly, with the weekend being long gone and forgotten.  And another justification could be for the calendar's symmetry. Schedule out the important stuff during you work week in the middle and it'll stand out more.  Not necessarily saying our calendar's better, just that there are ways of justifying/explaining why we use it and prefer it."

Sweden of article  BMP-1 service history:       Sweden purchased 338 Soviet manufactured ex-East German BMP-1s in mid-1994  and an additional 12 in 1996. They gave the vehicle the designation 'Pbv 501' (Pansarbandvagn 501). With Czech specialists, all Pbv 501 IFVs were upgraded to Swedish Army standards (Pbv 501A) from 1996. A few were upgraded further to serve as command vehicles. There were 340 vehicles in service in 2006 when they were withdrawn from the I 2, I 12, and I 16 infantry regiments, and the P 4 armored regiment. 250 vehicles were in mint condition having driven less than 120 km. Sweden offered its BMP-1s, plus spare parts and training equipment for sale. The original plan had been to sell them to a single sovereign customer. They might also be sold in batches of fifty to separate states; customers to express their interest before 16 June 2008 and submit their bids before 15 August 2008. Transactions to be approved by the Swedish and German authorities (Sweden held the German end user certificate). The other option considered was scrapping the vehicles in Sweden, according to the regulations.  It was announced in December 2008 that the Czech Republic had purchased all Swedish BMP-1s (PBV 501) and spares.

I found this hub in a drawer, thought it might work. I removed the top panel and took out the circuit board which had all the Ethernet ports attached. The remaining case was just right. Looks good on the desk.  I also use an old rack mount KVM as a bookshelf.  http://support.netgear.com/product/EN108"

Perfectfit,3bkbu7,alud2340,15,Tue Jun 30 03:22:31 2015 UTC,elaborate please
Perfectfit,3bkbu7,mechanical_Fred,49,Tue Jun 30 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"I am admittedly not a calculus expert but I'll try. Calculus takes a look at change as a phenomena with mathematic functions. One application of calculus is creating 3 dimensional objects by taking 2 dimensional ""slices"" of it over time. This gif actually goes a bit further. It shows a case where a 1D point is also a ""slice"" of the 2D ""slice"" of the 3D figure. Let me explain. As the bar goes through the slit, think of the exact location of the bar in the slit as a 1D point. As position of the bar changes over time a 2D >< shape is formed (i.e. the slit) by the moving 1D point. At any given point in time, the 1D point is a slice of the 2D figure and all the 1D slices added up over time create the 2D figure (defining idea in calculus!). If the change in 2D slits was measured in time for the entire 360 degree rotation, an hourglass 3D figure is formed. All by starting with a 1D point. With the help of calculus, we can derive a 3D object by measuring the change in change of position of a point in space over time."
