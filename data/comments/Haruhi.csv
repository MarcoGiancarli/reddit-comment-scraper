Haruhi,3e1jyt,1tobedoneX,3,Tue Jul 21 06:27:45 2015 UTC,"Tai's big ""What now"" post  Main sources: TvTropes.com, Wikipedia.org, bato.to, Haruhi Wiki. Thanks to all their editors.  So, you just finished the currently best non-standalone anime movie, and you notice this little thing inside you. You want more. But, oh gasp, the movie was the last part. There are no anime episodes that take place after it. So, what should you do?  Read the Light Novels  Hmmmm, but where? Easy. Currently there are 11 Novels, of which the first four are completely adapted. All of them are released in English (Volume 10 and 11 were released as one) by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers and Yen Press. To elaborate:    Number Japanese name English Name Release JP Release EN Time    1 Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya June 2003 May 2009 April-May 2010   2 Suzumiya Haruhi no Tameiki The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya September 2003 October 2009 May, October-November 2010   3 Suzumiya Haruhi no Taikutsu The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya December 2003 July 2010 June, July 2010, July 2007   4 Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoshitsu The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya July 2004 November 2010 December 2010, July 2007   5 Suzumiya Haruhi no Boso The Rampage of Haruhi Suzumiya October 2004 June 2011 August, November, December 2010   6 Suzumiya Haruhi no Doyo The Wavering of Haruhi Suzumiya March 2005 November 2011 November, December 2010   7 Suzumiya Haruhi no Inbo The Intrigues of Haruhi Suzumiya August 2005 June 2012 January, February 2011   8 Suzumiya Haruhi no Fungai The Indignation of Haruhi Suzumiya May 2006 November 2012 March 2011   9 Suzumiya Haruhi no Bunretsu The Dissociation of Haruhi Suzumiya April 2007 June 2013 April 2011   10 Suzumiya Haruhi no Kyogaku (Zen) The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya (First) May 2011 November 2013 April 2011   11 Suzumiya Haruhi no Kyogaku (Go) The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya (Last) May 2011 November 2013 April, May 2011    For a chronological timeline click here  Note regarding The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya (Last): Yes, this is volume 11, not 10b. However, the English translation was released as a single volume. According to the official fanbook 'The Observation of Haruhi Suzumiya', this is not Nagaru Tanigawa's last novel in this series.  Each english release has a paperback (With an ugly one-colour cover) and a hardcover (With the original, beautiful, Japanese cover art) version.  The earliest not adapted short story is Snowy Mountain Syndrome from Volume 5 (Rampage). The earliest volume with no parts adapted whatsoever is Volume 7 (Intrigues).  All volumes are available on Amazon or Book Depository or wherever you shop. If you're cheap, and lucky, you may be able find the original fan-translated Baka-tsuki version at the Yo-ho-ho port of your choice. Which version is up to you, the official translation also doesn't have the ""Miss Asahina"" bullshit from the dub, but it also leaves out any suffixes, so yeah.  Interesting to note is that Chris Pai, the man who translated the first fansubs for Haruhi (a.f.k.), not only went on to create the Baka-Tsuki version, but also in the end was hired by Yen Press to translate the novels.   Read the Manga  When Haruhi started to really pick up in popularity, a manga Adaptation was started in May 2004, drawn by Makoto Mizuno... and was promptly axed in December, with the artist being fired, either because he drew and sold unauthorized Hentai for the series he was drawing for, or the artwork seen in this series being less than stellar (most likely the latter).  Even today it is very hard to find a physical copy of it, much less scanlations.  In 2005, a new manga, drawn by Gaku Tsugano and directly supervised by Nagaru Tanigawa, began serialization. It ended in December 2013, when all currently released light novels were completely adapted. All 20 volumes are currently released by Yen Press in English,  Scanlations stopped with Disappearance, with the exception of only a few later chapters. If you wish to directly continue, start with  Volume 10 which adapts Love at First Sight from Volume 6 and Snowy Mountain Syndrome from Volume 5  Read/watch the official parodies  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya-chan  A Yonkama by Puyo starring chibi versions of all Haruhi characters introduced in Season 1 (Even Emiri Kimidori, despite being so irrelevant, it takes her whole volumes in the LN to show up a second time.). It is mostly absurd situation with characters behaving even crazier than the series. I mean, just listen to the opening. This show is a gag-series like you want it. Ah, yes, opening, fo course: The manga has been adapted in a 25-epsiode short anime series, which has been dubbed into English. The manga has been released by Yen Press, surpassing any kind of scanlations.  Nyoron Churuya-san  A short yonkama that started as a doujin, but was eventually published as an official yonkama. It follows the attempts of a chibi Tsuruya called Churuya to get her favorite food - smoked cheese. Unfortunely that doesn't happen often, and she mostly ends a strip saying ""Nyoro~n"" If you ever asked yourself about where that phrase come from, now you know. Was adapted in a 13-episode short anime series, which also has been dubbed into English. The manga has been released by Yen Press, surpassing scanlations.  The Intrigue of Itsuki Koizumi  Another manga by Puyo. I...actually don't know anything about this. It's fairly new however, as it launched in April 2012. No scanlations or English release exist. I think.  Third-Party Anthologies  There are currently two collections of short manga stories, written and illustrated by various artists. Both, The Misfortune of Kyon & Koizumi and The Celebration of Haruhi Suzumiya have been released by Yen Press in English.  Read the official spin-off  The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan  Puyo's next manga, this time a more ""serious"" one. The story is very simple: What if, instead of supernatural stuff existing, supernatural stuff just didn't exist, and never had.. The ""story"" follows the cute adventures of ""super shy book worm"" Yuki Nagato who managed to save the Literature club from disbanding by getting someone called ""Kyon"" to join, and the happenings they have with Yuki's neighbour and Kyon's Class Rep. Ryoko, these two students from Koyoen, Haruhi and Itsuki, the beautiful senpais Mikuru and Tsuruya, as well as these two guys Taniguchi and Kunikida, and, of course, Kyon's old friend from middle school, and a certain female friend of Taniguchi.  An anime has been hinted at since as early as December 2013, but we only got definite confirmation in September 2014, stating the anime to air in 2015. On the 18th of December 2014 it was announced that Satelight would adapt the manga, with a very unknown staff to say the least. No Ishihara, no Takemoto, no Itou, no Yura, no Ishida, no Tamura, no Tanaka, no Shigemura, no Takanashi, no Yamaguchi, no Nishiya. Well Yasuda is on board, so it might be good.  Read the Side stories  Two Side stories exist too:  Rainy Day (published alongside 'Surprise' in 2011) which takes place in September 2009, telling us the story of how Kyon got his catch-phrase in middle school.  Random Numbers (published alongside the artbook 'Haruhi Hyakka' in 2013) which takes place on 3rd of January 2011, telling us the story of a visit of the SOS Brigade to a Shrine.  Listen to the CDs  Insert Songs  In the show a total of three insert songs are played in the show, all of them written by Aki Hata and composed and arranged by Satoru Kousaki, who also the music for the main series.  The first one is Koi no Mikuru Densetsu, sung by Yūko Gotō as Mikuru Asahina, which was shown as the ending theme of ""The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina"". The two others are God knows… and Lost my music, both sung by Aya Hirano as Haruhi Suzumiya while performing for ENOZ in the episode ""Live Alive"". The three songs were combinded on the album ""Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsumeawase"".  Character Songs  Between 2006 and 2009, a total of 16 character image song albums were released. For a full list of all of them, click here  Drama CD  A Drama CD called Sound Around, telling a story taking place in Fall 2010, has been published in 2007. It is unlicensed, but, as always, Google is your friend."

Well, then again, the guy who made this probably needed to either make his own or borrow from someone else, and the latter is all kinds of messed up and complicated."
Haruhi,3e1jyt,Pyzlnar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"For the art I tried to stick to official art as much as possible, or used fanart that closely resembled the original.  Yasumi and Sasaki were a problem because back when I did the timeline (jun 2014) I could not find that much art of them at all, so I stuck with the official ones.  Uhm I don't mind updating them, maybe when they release a new novel / s3.  <<;"

Haruhi,3e1jyt,Muphrid15,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"Well, in that case:  Read GOOD fanfics  According to Sturgeon's Law 90 % of everything is crud. But in turn, it must mean that there are 10% good fanfics. These are some of them.   Can be read immediately  Inversion ""A look at another side of the Disappearance Arc...."" We don't know what happened after Kyon pressed that button. Inversion tells us what may have happened. A very well done speculation fic showing just how much of a dick John Smith actually is.  Suzumiya Haruhi no Injun ""The Vacillation of Haruhi Suzumiya: Whether it's between normalcy and adventure or love and your career, making choices is tough. Unfortunately for Kyon, when the person with the difficult choice is a god, sometimes the solution isn't so convenient."" This works so well, it could be an actual Haruhi volume. The plot is unique, the interactions work, the resolution is Haruhi-like- in short: It's a pretty good read.   The Courtship of Hazuki's Father ""All Kyon wanted was one day of peace. He should have known that such a request would only be invitation for something even weirder than aliens, time travelers, and espers: his daughter."" Yes, it's a dead fic after three chapters, but who cares. This fic has one of the most Kyon-nest narration in Haruhi fanfics. It's enough, just for a short time.  In your Dreams ""Golden Week has arrived! While the rest of the SOS Brigade makes plans, Kyon is forced to go to a family reunion far out in the country—so Haruhi gives him an assignment: learning about lucid dreaming. Surely nothing unusual could come of that… "" Created by two of the most well-known Haruhi Fanfic authors, it is a character-driven fic with lots of very cool interactions.  The Melancholy of Shinigami Ryuk ""When the Death Note falls into the hands, not of an ordinary human being, but Haruhi Suzumiya, the world becomes more 'interesting' in a way that Ryuk never would have expected and Kyon never would have wanted."" 'What if character X finds a Death Note.' This is a very common premise you can find in fanfic crossovers with Death Note, and given Haruhi's popularity, it was only a matter of time until such a thing too find. But of course, when Haruhi finds the note, she doesn't turn into a real killer. I mean why should she? Instead, something far more dangerous begins to happen.  Meet the Suzumiyas ""Kyon's father has been transferred away for his job, and Kyon must move away. However, soon an opportunity comes up for him to stay and continue interacting with the SOS Brigade: He can stay with Haruhi. But, not only does this mean Kyon will live in the same house as our favourite hyperactive reality warper, he will also be staying with her parents: the sweet but spacy (and relatively eccentric) Naru and the absolute jerk Oruki. ""  Ah, a classic. Also one of most well-known fic, it places Kyon in a very tricky situation. Some parts are Jossed as of Volume 11.  Should be read after finishing the LNs, so you can avoid any kind of spoilers  You Got HaruhiRolled! ""Watch as a writer with too much time on his hands, places the cast of TMOHS into absurd situations, ridiculous parodies, and scenarios with disturbing dialogue."" A much more vulgar and ridiculous version of Haruhi-chan, this is your fic if you just want to turn off your bain and have fun. Even provides a page quote on Tvtropes  Kyon: Big Damn Hero ""A Tvtropes website/Haruhi crossover. Kyon with a beam saber. Haruhi aware of her powers. An unsubtle harem plot. Did I mention the Higurashi crossover? Now say it with a straight face - I dare you."" Written by Brain ""Durandall"" Randall, it is one of the best and well-known Haruhi fanfics in existence.  A e-book compilation can be found here (pdf) and here (epub) and the first 5 chapter were even adapted as a Sound Novel. (Youtube link.) Download can be found via you know how. Sadly, now a dead fic. As of 17th of January 2014, the author is no longer with us. More info can be found on the TvTropes page  Later. ""In his thirties, Kyon has lived a life different from the one he anticipated. He hasn't seen Haruhi in almost fifteen years. How much has changed in that time? How much is still the same? What does it mean for both of them when they meet again?"" A fanfic by the creator of Kyon: Big Damn Hero, this time it takes the ""Haven't seen in age"" idea and makes it good.  The Anagram of Suzumiya Kurumi. ""The trauma that I am talking about is that of my energetic, paranoid, manic, unstoppable mother, who taught me almost from the day of my birth about time travellers, ESPers, aliens, magicians, yakuza, vengeful gods, and sliders."" A very nice fanfic, which... I actually shouldn't say anything about it. It's very good.  The Coin ""All her life, Haruhi's been searching–not just for espers or aliens but for others who want to find them, too. Now, she realizes her power to reshape the world...and that the people around her have never believed in something they didn't know to be true."" I previously posted a snippet of this because I simply cannot stop fanboying about this fic. It's a well-written story, by a redditor (/u/muphrid15), that believably explores a simple situation in which Haruhi might realize her powers. The story stays mainly light-hearted, although it does have its moments of drama.  Sadly the author probably won't write anything esle for Haruhi, as he is currently fixing SAO (or so I hope).  The Shadow of Haruhi Suzumiya ""Awakening to a completely new reality, Kyon must make sense of what is going on, and find his way out of the maze of possibilities he is now trapped in. There is more than meets the eye. Far, far more. A fic that is set during the Dissociation."" A denial-inducing, angering, bangaining, depressing, but also acceptable fic, in which Kyon is put though a meat grinder of emotions. Read it, just so you have experienced one.  The Connection of Kyon and Kori ""Kyon has experienced many strange things in life, be it aliens, time-travellers or espers, but he has yet to see a slider. Now a girl appeared in his bedroom, and seems to fulfill this role, but is she really? Is she the missing card? Or is she something even stranger, the start of series of events that could possibly endanger the whole world, present and future?"" What? What do you mean ""Don't advertise you own fics if they are not finished!""  But.. I mean... Just take a look! It has everything you want: Time travel, cute girls, a plot which fucks with your head, cute boys, snarky humour, and lots of talking.  STILL NOT ENOUGH?  Visit the TvTropes FanficRec page for more!  MANY THANKS TO:  All the editors of my sources. I already said it, but I will repeat it again. They are awesome.  /u/Pyzlnar for creating the timelines  Muphrid15 for allowing me to quote his work 'The Coin'  TvTropes user Specular, because his snippets have helped through doing this (He added my waifu Miyuki in them.)  When I'm on it, all other Soulriders too. Thank you for making me love Haruhi as much as I do now."

Haruhi,3e0fck,SaiyamanMS,3,Tue Jul 21 00:17:42 2015 UTC,"This probably won't apply to many people because of what sub this is, but if you have finished the Nagato Yuki-chan anime, another suggestion would be to watch the anime The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and the movie, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya.  If you are one of the few people that has seen Nagato Yuki-chan, but not the original series and somehow found this subreddit, then I would definitely suggest checking out the Haruhi Suzumiya works.  Nagato Yuki-chan is roughly based off The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, so I think it adds more to the anime to see where it originated from."
Haruhi,3e0fck,SpaceCowboy321,2,Tue Jul 21 00:47:38 2015 UTC,"While I love the original show and try to recommend it often to people, I think that the switch from the cute Nagato-centric show to the Haruhi-centric show with robot Nagato would be too dramatic of a shift right off the bat and would turn off a lot of Nagato-chan viewers (unless they wanted more Haruhi)."
Haruhi,3e0fck,Kumoriel,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"Correct. I would only suggests this to huge fans of Haruhi.  Switching from Melancholy of Haruhi to Disappearance of Nagato, you switch from an established universe (the original material), characters you know & love, and you get to see them in a more.... slice of life setting.  Other way around you basically have a nice slice of life anime where shit gets weird. Fast. :P"
Haruhi,3e0fck,Licargon,2,Tue Jul 21 03:50:26 2015 UTC,Other way around you basically have a nice slice of life anime where shit gets weird. Fast. :P   That's my favorite :)

Edit: Apparently the movie theatre had some issue with their projector so the movie got called off. I've gone and x-posted it."
Haruhi,3e0fck,Licargon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:01:26 2015 UTC,"To give an honest opinion, unless the price is a lot lower (or Amazon doesn't deliver the item to your country), and you REALLY value the quality of your books, I would advise against ordering from Book Depository.  Why, you ask? I've ordered 5 Haruhi LN's and a SAO (Progressive. Get it. It's good.) LN, and they've arrived in something I can only call a ""cardboard sleeve"" without any plastic foil, which just gets put in your mailbox (so not a lot of protection from the rain, if your mailbox isn't waterproof), so the corners weere a bit roughed up (nothing major, but I know a lot of people who really want their books in mint condition), while Amazon's packaging is much safer for books (as far as I've ordered books through there).  If you value price (BD ships for free worldwide) and don't mind if some corners have some visible wear when they arrive, go for BD, else go for Amazon."
Haruhi,3dwlh1,dywulfski,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:01 2015 UTC,That is a very interesting theory.  This is one of the reasons I love the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise--theories are everywhere.
Haruhi,3dwlh1,Zinx10,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:10 2015 UTC,"Using the tired old trope of 'travelling parallel universes' is the way to cheat when the plot has no logic to begin with.  First, you'd have to believe that Huruhi, who is 'God' (ie should be omnipotent... like you know, a GOD)  still doesn't know that her SOS Brigade is chock full of Aliens, Time Travelers and Espers.    I don't believe that the directors are that good at tying the series together."
Haruhi,3dwlh1,FatBabyBrother,4,Mon Jul 20 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"Omnipotent is different that omniscient, though... Unlike most religions where the main god is both all-powerful and all-knowing, the writer made Haruhi a god that is one but not the other... Makes for a fun story where she, potential destroyer of the world, only has the knowledge and world-view of a largely self-centered high-schooler and everyone around her is part of a grand conspiracy to try to keep it that way.  I think the parallel universe schtick works well for Haruhi, since it plays out almost like a sandbox for thought experiments... Details are given, differences and similarities are shown, and you have room to play around and make sense of those details. Which is why Haruhi as a series is just a playground for conspiracy theory upon conspiracy theory.  What if the Yuki-chan universe was the original universe before Haruhi's powers tampered with it?    What if the Yuki-chan universe is a construct made by robot Nagato to escape Haruhi?   What if the Yuki-chan universe is a world created by god-Kyon?  What if the Yuki-chan universe is a world revised by robot Asakura after she was banished by robot Yuki?  I think the writers know what they're doing, and there's a lot of mindless conspiracy-theorying to be had with this series.  TLDR: I disagree Haruhi should be about a straightforward plot neatly tying up.  Weird tangents and parallels are what make this series for me."
Haruhi,3dwlh1,whut-whut,2,Mon Jul 20 18:03:45 2015 UTC,The connections to the original series are nothing more than easter eggs for the dedicated fans.    With the 'parallel universe' theory you could connect random event you like and simply say 'parallel universe!'    TL;DR: I don't think the writers were that smart.
Haruhi,3dwlh1,FatBabyBrother,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the writers created Yuki-chan with all those random conspiracies I made up in mind, I'm just saying that they intentionally wrote a story that covered the same ground timeline wise as the original, keeping some things the same and having a few other details changed.  All the time purposely not neatly wrapping things up with 'how' or 'why'.  Now, you can dismiss that as lazy writing, but my opinion is that for Haruhi 'it works'... They purposely made things weird and open ended.  They could have written a slice of life with cameos and Easter eggs that made more sense, but they didn't... They could have closed everything neatly, but they didn't. Even the main title arc of Yuki-chan is a majorly weird, wtf, and not fully explained arc, and I really don't think it was by accident they would name the whole series after an arc like that.  Weird and not properly explained was what they were going for all along, to fit in with the main series.  If they just wanted a straight up love story with kyon and nagato but with Easter eggs, they could have easily done that, but they didn't. Fun in Haruhi from the very original (at least for me) isn't having a concrete plot and ending that 'gives you the solution' on what happened, but that it's all the nonsense that's barely out of reach of making sense... Half the fun is to piece together a scenario where 'it all makes sense'.   TLDR; plot in Haruhi has always been a sloppy mess, yuki-chan was written to match the original on purpose.  It's not for everyone, but the series is fun when you bask in the jumbled nonsense and try to make the broken puzzle fit together."
Haruhi,3dwlh1,whut-whut,2,Mon Jul 20 22:10:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is Koizumi and some members of his faction that call Haruhi a 'God'. Plus, his reasoning for naming her one is not based on her being a omnipotent being. He names her a God because she has the power to destroy and create at whim. If you've read the novels, She is definitely not omnipotent.   Actually, her not knowing that her SOS Brigade is full of supernaturals is another theory up for discussion. There's no solid evidence saying that she doesn't know. She might know about it, but decides to stay silent and plead ignorance in order to make things interesting - such as seeing how the others try to act normal around her. Unlike Koizumi's prediction, she doesn't alter the entire world to be filled with supernaturals even knowing about them because she doesn't want a world like that. Isn't it more fun if they are rare and exclusive?  Also, Puyo most likely did not write Yuki-chan without consulting Tanigawa-sensei first. After all, the first Haruhi manga got discontinued quickly because of the lack of Tanigawa-sensei's input. Plus, as an author of a spin-off manga, I'm pretty sure that Puyo is a huge fan of the original series and would have swarms of ideas in his head on how to link his spin-off the main franchise. So with the guidance of Tanigawa-sensei, they could discuss theories and plot-points and turn Yuki-chan into a series that helps further build upon the Haruhi-verse."

Some people forget about that when making AMVs.  Quite an interesting song choice, which I appreciate. I wasn't sure if it would work when I first heard it, but you made it fit nicely.

David Byrne's solo work isn't popular at all, and I knew that people would find it strange.   It's just such an emotional song that I knew I could make it work well with the themes in the Endless Eight—namely, breaking out of an unbearably repetitive cycle and restoring things to their natural order.   Although, funny enough, even though I did almost all of the editing subconsciously, a kind of story seems to emerge (in conjunction with the lyrics) that's totally different from the source material..... Some kind of love triangle, maybe. I'm curious if you noticed that, too."

Haruhi,3cwkem,UndeadNightmare937,3,Sat Jul 11 16:28:36 2015 UTC,I don't hope for anything. I would prefer them to do nothing else if they're not gonna do S3. I didn't like Yuki-chan at all and the only thing they could really do is more of that.

Haruhi,3cwkem,Licargon,3,Mon Jul 13 02:32:44 2015 UTC,At this point Season 3 is the same as Half Life 3 for me and in all honesty where as I wouldnt mind anime adaptations for any remaining non-main Haruhi stuffs I not wanting them (I know very contradictory)  In short unless if it is Season 3 Im not asking for it but wont turn anything away if it is announced.

I loved how the books ended (I know there can there might be more coming), it felt like a great way to close the story.   Anime wise, I'm fine too. Although, I'd love to see another movie with the rest of the material, It makes more sense than a S3. Maybe 3 2 movies? Although, for what I remember, it fits perfectly in one lovely movie, but it might be slow.  And I fairly sure that it's too slow for a full a double season (24 eps), but it might fit well in a 12 ep season."
Haruhi,3cwkem,Rein3,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can adapt the rest of the books in only two movies, especially the last three books. If they really were looking to adapt everything, it would require something more along the lines of two seasons worth of episodes and maybe another movie.   Even then, they might need like another movie or some OVAs to round off everything."
Haruhi,3cwkem,UndeadNightmare937,2,Tue Jul 14 00:55:14 2015 UTC,The entire 16 episode Yuki-Chan was a front. The holy lords at Kyoani descend from their throne high atop their mountains of cash and bestow upon us a 10 episode snowy mountain syndrome to finish out the 26 total episode season.
Haruhi,3cwkem,itisnear,2,Sat Jul 11 19:49:41 2015 UTC,26 more episodes of Endless Eight.
Haruhi,3cwkem,iEzhik,2,Sun Jul 12 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"The article points out several good reasons why a new season isn't likely, but I wouldn't say that it's downright impossible. After all, one of the big hit anime of the past year, Parasyte, is based on a manga which ended approximately 20 years ago. Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works was an adaptation of a visual novel that's over 10 years old. (And already had a previous [lesser quality] animated adaptation as well.)  While the manga is admittedly ongoing, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure has just recently started animating material over 20 years old. Sailor Moon ended in 1997 and is getting a new anime. Dragon Ball ended in 1995 and is getting a new anime sequel.  Business is all about making money, and as long as there's money to be made from a third season of Haruhi, you can never entirely 100% rule out the possibility of a continuation. (Of course, there's no reason to assume there will be a continuation either unless it's actually announced.)  As for The Intrigues of Koizumi Itsuki-kun, it was published within volume 9 of Haruhi-chan."
Haruhi,3ctrw4,bazzadwarf,3,Fri Jul 10 18:36:42 2015 UTC,"Another enjoyable episode. Covered two chapters, just like I expected it probably would. Kyon's sister is comedy gold as always and the Remote Island Syndrome shout outs were fun. Next week is certainly going to cover chapter 38, but it's hard to say whether any of chapter 39 (the final chapter of volume 5) will make it in.  A bit more said on my Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsuisou translation blog (Where I've just finished the Asakura route of the game! Yay!) per usual. Looking forward to how the final episode turns out."
Haruhi,3ctrw4,SaiyamanMS,3,Fri Jul 10 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"I guess we're officially back to Brigade antics, just with way more cute Kyon and Nagato moments. Also, references are just spewing left and right.   I hope the finale has some sort of climax. Fingers still crossed for a Haruhi S3 announcement!"
Haruhi,3ctrw4,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:07:09 2015 UTC,"16 episodes is a very odd number. What's going to take Nagato's place for the remaining 10-ish weeks of the current season? It's not enough for a full cour. And as we know, season 2 kind of just turned up in the middle of season 1 reruns without any fanfare. Imagine if Snowy Mountain Syndrome suddenly aired two weeks from now as the start of a 10-ish episode season 3!  ... Probably won't happen. But it'd be neat if it did. I'm not sure I'd call the next two chapters (of which at least one will be covered next episode) a climax, but we can probably expect Endless Eight references. (Maybe next week's episode will get re-run 8 weeks in a row to fill out the current season instead?)"

So, I thought this episode was quite good, but that ending credits animation is good!  I just love how they do subtle changes every now and then (this episode's ending credits had Nagato grab one of the stars as well as have the stars at the end of the credits).  Now time for the last episode animation (assuming the OVA doesn't count the finale)!"
Haruhi,3ctrw4,Zinx10,2,Sat Jul 11 08:29:11 2015 UTC,"If you follow the color code from the earlier episode credits where each color star follows a different character shadow, she grabs the yellow Kyon star and holds on to it, where in previous endings the stars all floated away without her."
Haruhi,3ctrw4,whut-whut,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:51:16 2015 UTC,(assuming the OVA doesn't count the finale)!   What does that mean exactly? Will there be an additional episode after no. 16?

Plot holes abound (does anyone else wish they had a rich friend that only appears when you need to do something like take a free vacation or go to the beach?) and references were pretty on the nose.   I agree the closed space thing was forced and if you didn't know WTF it meant then it would just appear to be a bad translation.    I really hate that  Yuki, the main character, is still treated like a retarded 6 year old.  It does not invoke any sympathy or give the character any endearing qualities other than for Kyon to perv over.  I mean really... he's got (and Kyon even admits) two way hotter girls with ACTUAL personalities yet he dotes on the tired, quiet, inept one.    I so wanted this to be something of a romance... but its just not.... well, not by any Western standard."

Haruhi,3cscw9,aguirre1pol,3,Fri Jul 10 11:25:06 2015 UTC,The openings and endings will vary depending on how you watch it either in the series order or chronological order.  Just to clarify the Season 1 Opening is Bouken Desho Desho with the ending being Hare Hare Yukai while the Season 2 Opening is Super Driver and the ending being Tomare.   If you are watching it in the order in which they came out you should have each pairs Opening and ending playing consecutively where as if you are watching it in chronological order the Opening and ending will change depending on what season they were originally aired in.  In short the 2009 broadcast is simply a chronological broadcast of Haruhi with both season 1&2 included in them so the Openings and Endings will be different see above  If you need a reference may I point you Here to the widely agreed upon chronological order to watch TMoHS and TDoHS

While I'm at it, I'll also clear up some of the information you posted here. Day of Sagittarius actually happens WAY after they make the website. Someday in the Rain does indeed take place right after Day of Sagittarius (Someday in the Rain is the last episode chronologically before the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya). The filming of the movie happens before Day of Sagittarius, right before the cultural festival episode called Live Alive. Endless Eight takes place during the summer, right before the filming of the movie and some time after the creation of the website.  As for what order you watched the series in, it looks like the order on the website was just jumbled. It's not chronological or broadcast, so I guess it was just random."

Haruhi,3c247j,Licargon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:29:57 2015 UTC,I've read up to Dissociation. Planning on ordering Surprise online soon. Really loving the style of writing in these books.
Haruhi,3c247j,revolution__,0,Mon Jul 13 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Read them all. IMO the story doesn't really go anywhere too interesting after Disappearance, felt like the author struggled with the plot. Not a terrible read by any means but I can see why no season 3 is being made, if the material was stellar it would have happened by now. Who knows though if there's a satisfying conclusion it could happen."
Haruhi,3c0r0c,bazzadwarf,8,Fri Jul 3 18:37:17 2015 UTC,"So sad watching Haruhi give up on Kyon... :(  Interesting twist though, non-magical world Kyon has a memory so bad, he doesn't remember how he first met either Haruhi or Nagato. But when not remembering how he met either of them, Nagato wins."

Haruhi,3c0r0c,Raszero,6,Sat Jul 4 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"The music in the last episodes (and in general, the whole series so far) has been phenomenal. I absolutely adore the serious music and the older ""Here comes Haruhi's shenanigans"" music."
Haruhi,3c0r0c,Zanamee,5,Sat Jul 4 21:19:43 2015 UTC,This just makes me want to root for Haruhi even more.
Haruhi,3c0r0c,UndeadNightmare937,4,Sat Jul 4 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this episode a lot for two big reasons:   Im glad Nagato has stopped being the most self conscious person (which was starting to get on my nevres), while also abandoning her older dryer personality from the original series (I was really happy to see her old self back again but it's good she's gone; that nagato isn't for this spin-off). I'll be honest by saying I do not ship Kyon and Nagato. I'm still for the Haurhi x Kyon from the original series and the disappearence hasn't changed that for me. I know Haurhi won't end up with Kyon (at least in this universe) but I'm going keep riding that ship train to the end :'(   P.S. I wouldn't think that they'd make another season of Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu but what do you guys think? I'd be down for another season just because it's Haruhi but is there still source material to work with? (I havent read the light novels)"
Haruhi,3c0r0c,sir_astronaut,4,Sat Jul 4 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert when it comes to Yuki-chan, but I'm pretty sure there's enough material for a second season. There are currently 8 volumes for the manga out right now, and I think we're currently in the fifth(?).   I don't think they would adapt any further, though. The manga is still rather new and the eighth volume came out recently. If they adapted a new season, it would defeat the purpose of buying the manga unless another volume came out to advertise.   Plus, I want a third season of Haruhi before I want anything Yuki-chan related."
Haruhi,3c0r0c,UndeadNightmare937,2,Sat Jul 4 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"I dare to fan the flames of hype, but a Sasaki intro at the end of Ep. 16 would be a hint towards Season 3."
Haruhi,3c0r0c,Volticore,2,Sat Jul 4 07:22:59 2015 UTC,I hope. There's also the OVA to consider.
Haruhi,3c0r0c,UndeadNightmare937,7,Sat Jul 4 07:30:01 2015 UTC,"I wrote this side-thought in /r/anime, but I'll post it here too in case it triggers discussion.    In a way though, when taken with the movie, this show puts a darker spin on the main series. (Haruhi movie spoilers)  In a world where Haruhi has no powers, Kyon would have no memory of John Smith, and Nagato and Kyon were meant to be. Main timeline Haruhi is said to gain her god powers sometime after the John Smith event, and constantly rewrite parts of reality when she's unhappy with a situation, which means in main timeline, Haruhi rewrote Nagato as a boring robot, and created a time loop where Kyon would see and remember John Smith with her... Stealing his attention and affection from Nagato.  That means the movie was now-a-robot (but still in love with Kyon) Nagato fighting back for her stolen reality and happiness with Kyon by learning and emulating Haruhi's rewrite powers (by observing all those -ugh- endless eight rewrites) and 'fixing' things to a lesser degree (lesser because kyon still remembers Haruhi's powers, and when Nagato gives Kyon a choice, he chooses to give Haruhi her powers back, and things fall back to Haruhi's preferred reality of haruhi being the center of the universe and yuki a boring robot.)  The movie kinda ended in an uneasy truce between the girls on that note. Even though Haruhi 'won' the tug of war, Nagato didn't exactly lose either. On the roof, Kyon near confesses to her, tells nagato he finally understands her feelings, promises to always be by her, support those feelings, and take on her challenges with her(although using Haruhi's powers)... Even though the world is controlled and rewritten by Haruhi to skew Kyon's attention and feelings her way, Kyon still eventually finds feelings for Nagato again.  TLDR: Movie takes place after this arc, Robo-Nagato goes back to her dimension realizing she loves Kyon and Kyon loves her, and that if Haruhi never had powers to turn her into a robot, she and Kyon would be together. Tries to fix it by removing Haruhi's powers at start of movie. Kyon gives back Haruhi's powers, but tells Nagato he now understands her from seeing the depowered Haruhi world, and actually tells her he'd stay by her side forever, even in Haruhi-world.  So, Haruhi worshippers, how does it feel knowing your god is an evil one, standing in the way of destined love? :)"
Haruhi,3c0r0c,whut-whut,6,Sat Jul 4 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"I read this on there, wrote a response, but refrained from posting it because I figured you weren't looking for discussion, just putting your thoughts out there. Now that I know though, I'd love to take you up on that offer. Of course, Haruhi movie spoilers ahead.    This theory only works if you believe that Haruhi was destined to never receive her powers in the main timeline, leading to Nagato and Kyon ending up together. This isn't the case, since we know that Haruhi gaining her powers was a pre-determined event in the timeline.   Kyon was always meant to meet Middle School Haruhi, Haruhi was always meant to run into him at North High, Nagato was always meant to change the world and Kyon was always meant to change it back. All of these events happened because history deemed it so. There was never a point where Haruhi never received her powers, allowing for the events in which Nagato is a human who falls in love with Kyon to take place, and allowing for the reality of Yuki-chan to happen in the original timeline.   So, let me propose my theory involving Yuki-chan if it was canon to the main timeline.  In the original Melancholy world, Nagato was growing resentful of having to watch over Haruhi all the time. She decides to visit another dimension, Yuki-chan, in order to see how being in a normal world would feel like. She experiences the Yuki-chan Disapperance arc, and realizes that she prefers this seemingly normal world to her own, since she falls in love with Kyon and the Kyon in this world has the possibilty of falling in love with her. She goes back to her own dimension, the Melancholy one, and rewrites the world to accommodate her desire of living in the other. This is when the events of the Disappearance movie occur.   Kyon changes the world back to the way it was because he prefers it that way, but becomes more understanding of Nagato and her situation. He promises that he'll always support her and that Haruhi will always do the same.   As for destined love, LN Spoilers  So, Nagato worshippers, how does it feel knowing your god is the actual evil one, actively opposing Kyon and Haruhi's blossoming relationship? ;)"
Haruhi,3c0r0c,UndeadNightmare937,2,Sat Jul 4 08:40:13 2015 UTC,"Nice. Awesome response. I love it.  Almost turns the whole thing into a chicken vs. egg debate on 'who gets dibs on the Kyon'. :)  I'm not disagreeing Haruhi x Kyon wins in the end main timeline...  And yes, all the stories result in Haruhi winning out... And history's written by the victor, and thus Haruhi x Kyon is best couple and everyone who tried to stop them could be labelled 'evil'...  But think about how she beat out Yuki in Kyon-bowl... Haruhi turning Yuki into a robot with her powers was pretty evil... Nagato didn't start as a robot, Haruhi made her that way (whether intentionally or not), shown by how Nagato's a normal girl when Haruhi's powers are sealed.  Yuki lost Kyon-bowl because she wasn't a girl Kyon could love... she was a robot.  If she was a normal girl, she'd have a chance (as shown twice in Yuki-chan and the movie)  The only way main-Haruhi would not be evil was if her powers merely summoned an alien robot Yuki from another planet or something... Instead of transforming a normal girl who Kyon could fall in love with into an emotionless robot.  In another light, Yuki winning Kyon-bowl only required Yuki rewriting the world so Haruhi didn't have powers, while Haruhi winning required Haruhi to override and replace Yuki's entire personality and background.... Which girl is 'less evil'?  Anyways. Again, love your response... This is the mindless fan debate I was hoping for... :)"
Haruhi,3c0r0c,whut-whut,3,Sat Jul 4 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it. Of course, it's nice to see your side of things.  I guess your point in this stems from the fact that you're thinking of Yuki-chan as being the main timeline, a timeline that can be replicated in the Melancholy one. If this was the case, then Haruhi turning Nagato into an emotionless robot would be true.   If we consider Melancholy the original timeline, while still considering Yuki-chan canon, then that would mean that Haruhi never turned Nagato into an alien. Yuki-chan was simply another dimension, another possibility in the endless sea of variables that can exist when we use the multiverse theory. It was never possible for that possibilty to take place in another dimension besides Yuki-chan, since that possibilty already exists in that timeline. Yuki was always an alien in Melancholy. If Haruhi had never received her powers in the main timeline, then Nagato would've never appeared. She wouldn't have been created to observe Haruhi.   That part about Haruhi summoning an alien robot is exactly what happened. Nagato wasn't a normal girl, she was a human interface created to observe Haruhi Suzumiya.   Looking at it this way, that would mean that Yuki winning Kyon-bowl would've actually required Yuki to rewrite the world and overwrite her own personality and background into that of the Yuki in Yuki-chan (that's a lot of Yuki's), while Haruhi winning would've only required what was always going to happen, her receiving her powers.   It's all about perspective here, really. Just depends on which one is the main timeline.  These debates can be pretty fun, huh?"
Haruhi,3c0r0c,UndeadNightmare937,2,Sat Jul 4 15:49:12 2015 UTC,Finally something has happened... although Nagato is still treated like a retarded 6 year old.  What is the deal and why does Asakura needing to dote on her?  I just don't get it.    Good to see Haruhi again... but I don't see how the flashback to middle school did much of anything but fan the flames of wanting TDoHS like action and not Nagato grunting all the time.

And Haruhi evidently has body image issues as she gets mad at Mikaro for having bigger breasts than her.  It also seems that there was an implied 'communication' between Nagato and Mikaro in the club room when Haruhi told Mikaro to quit the Calligraphy club... starting at 22:11 when she see's Nagato... 'I see...', 'I understand'...    Note to Kyon:  When asked if you want to grab some free boob by the creator of the universe 'I'll pass' is NOT the correct answer."

Haruhi,3bl96s,Zinx10,3,Tue Jun 30 03:23:26 2015 UTC,I like it. I was really confused about the whole genre shift from Haruhi to Nagato as I was expecting more paranormal/ mystery stuff that was in Haruhi. Not this rom-com stuff in Nagato. Also I disliked the art style when it was previewed. But the original voices from Haruhi made the whole transition a lot easier to stomach. Also I really like Asakura getting a larger role instead of being the same nice but then crazy person schtick she had in the movie and show
Haruhi,3bl96s,The_Makster,3,Tue Jun 30 07:33:52 2015 UTC,So the dubbed version includes a romance/comedy??   I might have to check that out... the Japanese version sure didn't.

I actually remember not liking those first few episodes that much in sub, but once I got around to watching it in dub, my enjoyment seemed to rise.   I'm not sure if it's because of the nostalgia of hearing the voices again or what, but rewatching the show in English is actually rather nice. If my enjoyment continues, this dub might just end up bumping up the show a point or two for me.  I really missed Haruhi and Kyon's banter in English. Also, Nagato sounds way better to me in English. I'm not a huge fan of her moe blob voice in Japanese when the comedy starts to happen."

Haruhi,3b7xs6,bazzadwarf,4,Fri Jun 26 18:15:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, this is probably going to be my favourite episode out of all of this. After just watching it, it is beautiful. The symbolism feels deep, and it's overall a good episode. The feeling of knowing really drives it home, and how Nagato acts accordingly makes it richer.  The phone call between Nagato and Kyon, nailed the scene as one of the best in the entire anime.  To put the icing and the cherry onto the $1 cake which tastes like a cake which costs $1 million, the acoustic-ish version of the ending song just made it all that better. Hell, I'm currently repeating it, and I am going to be very angry if they don't release it as a single."
Haruhi,3b7xs6,1tobedoneX,3,Sat Jun 27 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"Nice episode.  Like the hot spring arc they added a lot of extra content, but this time I thought it was good new content.

She's an absolute mood killer for the tone that was being set, so it makes sense why she's a no-show.  I still think the writer has no clue what they are doing.

Haruhi,3b4la9,bonghits96,3,Thu Jun 25 22:37:46 2015 UTC,"I think Kyon is the first actual anime protagonist that I actually ever ""got"". Someone wholly human and relatable. I won't repeat a lot of what others have already said, but I tend to agree overall.   I think if I had anything to complain about Kyon (and yeah, I know, it seems like I just come to these threads to complain, but I do love this show I promise) it is that I wish he'd become something like 25% more decisive and proactive by the end of the series (I mean Light Novels, his development int he show is excellent, bar none).   I just felt like in the novels, there was a lot of backsliding, as far as his personal involvement goes. Things just happen to him, he replies with a sarcastic or confused remark. Then next thing happens. He doesn't, you know, actually try to stop a problem by getting a head of it. Which is just crazy to me. I'm lazy too, but it is easier to go turn the water in the bath off than to just try mopping up the torrent pouring over the side.   But! Things I love about Kyon are heavily involved with how he is written. I love how much you can read into his character, especially since he is such an unreliable narrator. He lies constantly to himself and to others (usually just to be contrary), but he is far more aware and intelligent than he admits to himself. He understand people better than he admits to himself, and I'd hazard that he was well aware that he both liked Haruhi at the end of the Melancholy arc and that she even liked him, though gods forbid an anime character acknowledge that sort of thing. (By the way, go watch Oremonogatari, also called My Love Story!, its pretty adorable and actually shows a relationship! Between! Characters!)   I also love that Kyon is human. Like, nothing special. Nothing unique. He just is some guy that got pulled into something amazing. I would be super disappointed more books got written and he ended up being something more than just human, as if he needed something more to justify his protagonist role."
Haruhi,3b4la9,Ergoemos,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:53:50 2015 UTC,Yes. To all of it.
Haruhi,3b4la9,Bioman2222,3,Tue Jun 30 18:25:06 2015 UTC,"Whew, it has been a while. I was starting to think that the discussion just died. Glad to see you bring it back, /u/bonghits96.   Alright, so now we're talking about Kyon, probably the greatest MC I've come across in anime so far. We all love his sarcastic remarks, his long monologues (at least not Koizumi levels), his constant back-and-forth with Haruhi. There's a lot of great things within his character, just like there's a lot of faults he has. He's someone that many of us can relate with, just because he has so many relatable qualities. His humor, his reactions to the situations he finds himself in, etc.  One thing I've always enjoyed from Kyon is the fact that he can stand on his own in a group of so many powerful beings. Aliens, time travelers, espers, and even a goddess don't seem to have as much influence as Kyon does. Sure, Nagato could probably kill Kyon with a single flick of the finger, Koizumi seems to understand or possess much more abstract knowledge than Kyon, even if he tries to justify it to the viewer with his countless historical war references. You're not fooling anyone, Kyon. Mikuru, of course, with her time travel makes her pretty vital to the story, and Haruhi is Haruhi, no need for further elaboration.   Yet, here we have a normal human being somehow surviving countless dangerous adventures just to keep up the charade for Haruhi and save the world. He's got arguably the most influence on Haruhi, which in and of itself is very impressive. Let's not forget his secret weapon ""John Smith."" He's the only one able to return the world back to the way it was during Disappearance, his outburst saves the Brigade during Endless Eight, his kiss saves the world during Melancholy, his handling of the Sigh incident leads to a significant change in Haruhi for the better, and all of this is just in the anime!  LN wise, Spoilers  All this time he spends with the Brigade leads to their growing trust in each other, and his subtle, yet somehow very apparent, feelings for Haruhi. I guess what I'm trying to say is, Kyon is extremely influential to the whole series, whether it's from his countless contributions to saving the world or him being the catalyst that helps the Brigade grow close like a family. Without him, his entire universe would have already been replaced by Haruhi, and all of the Brigade members wouldn't have developed nearly as much as they do throughout the novels. I can't believe Kyon was supposed to be an Esper at first. He works so well as just a regular person."
Haruhi,3b4la9,UndeadNightmare937,3,Fri Jun 26 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Kyon.... is probably the most fantastic anime character I've run across. When I first watched the main series, there was sort of an instant 'click' that happened for me. That's not usually something that happens. Combined with Crispin Freeman as the VA, he's probably one of my favorite TV/Anime/Movie characters of all time. The existence of the character makes me regret not finding out about Haruhi when the novels came out. And, IMO, he's pretty much the driving force of the series. Perhaps that's the intention of the character? Or am I just finding some sort of weird connection that wasn't intended? Dunno.  Onto the ""Hot Topics""...   Haruhi x Kyon   Sadly seems like it's gonna happen. Personally I think any other pairing is better, but it seems likely Haruhi x Kyon is gonna be a thing. I'd rather see him with Mikuru, TBH (despite my absolute hatred for Mikuru). The Mikuru/Kyon time traveling scenes are some of the best in the series. And more of that is certainly welcome.   Kyon's growing appreciation of Nagato   I'm not sure whether this was about the spin-off or the main series, but I see it as the same. A lot of people in general (and in Haruhi :P) tend to ignore super-introverted individuals. For the main series, Nagato is more or less content with sitting on the sidelines, though we can see an emotional struggle within her as she wishes to get involved. Kyon is also tending to notice this, which makes for an interesting dynamic. In the spin-off... actually I don't have much to say about the spin-off. Kyon's pretty oblivious to a lot of things, so I'm not surprised.   Would Kyon have actually connected with that closed fist punch in Sighs if Itsuki hadn't been there?   Irrelevant, IMO. What's happened happened.   Is Kyon a jerk for pressing the Enter key in Disappearance?   No? Yuki very clearly left it up to Kyon to make the right decision. Either one would have been fine. I personally think Kyon made the right choice, since the world was unfairly changed to Yuki's whims and desires, rather than anyone having any sort of input.   Exactly how powerful is Kyon, anyway?   I've posted my thoughts on this before, but I think he's a slider. But again, my views might change after I read the rest of the novels..."
Haruhi,3b4la9,Kafke,4,Sat Jun 27 09:11:19 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make a comment earlier but I couldn't muster the words to say so. I was hoping that some other people talking would spark what I wanted to say, but alas, 3 hours have passed, and the only comment is by our /u/bonghits96.  Kyon is my favorite character. He's actually your favorite character too, you just don't realize. He's even /u/DevoutHaruhiist's favorite. Well actually I'm not here to put words in your mouth, so you can all go back to liking Koizumi the most (if only it was true), but Kyon has a very good reason for being my favorite.  Why is that? I have no idea. I wanted to type a long explanation on why he's the greatest that I realized after my post anime thoughts, but I never got around to it, and I still can't type it here. I'll try though, I'm just not good with my keyboard today.  Kyon is very human. ""nigga they all human what u smokin"" No they're not. They're aliens, and deities, and for some reason, a Kyon. I'm of the firm belief that just as Koizumi convinced Kyon that Haruhi is a goddess, they decided to make every character just slightly less better than Kyon. They're all great, but I think their greatness makes me like Kyon more. Kyon reminds me Sokka from ATLAB. A guy with no powers stuck with a group of people with powers. Yet this time, rather then in their setting, where the people with power benefit and can do all this crazy stuff, this takes place in the real world, where Kyon doesn't exactly benefit, but he can still shine just as much as everyone else. This is kinda the reason the episode where they go into the computer and fight that like T-Rex or whatever it was, was my least favorite. All he did was watch. He didn't contribute to the fight, but that made me realize he's the most important character. He pretty much influences the whole plot. I still can't express my love for Kyon. Maybe a few beers and hugs will, but ain't nobody got time fo' that.  On the subject of those questions, I really like them. On the subject of Disappearance, I felt like Kyon was given a position of power, just like everyone else in the series has had, and decided to use it as much as they did. If it wasn't for their influence, he wouldn't press it. Much how in that one episode of Avatar once Sokka freaking takes over a fleet of ships now that he can, or the one where he works with his dad on that beach stopping fire nation folk, despite him being powerless.  My whole speech probably sounds really bad, but I am having a hard time to write this. Like I said, I wrote it earlier, (at least something similar) but didn't post because I wanted other commentor's influence. Alas, no one has posted in the past few hours, so I took the liberty of doing so. (At least tried to... hehe.)  TL;DR Kyon is cool because he's big and powerful, but doesn't have it blatantly like everyone else. He doesn't even realize it. He just wants to get through highschool but can also destroy the world if he wanted to. Because of his lack of BAM BAM BLOOM kinda powers, he's more human, and I like that in a show of Aliens and whatnot."
Haruhi,3b4la9,DevoutHaruhiist,3,Fri Jun 26 02:26:37 2015 UTC,No. There is only one character in the entire series. I don't talk on these things cause i literally have nothing postive to say about anyone but my one true goddess which i could go on forever with her glorious praises.
Haruhi,3b4la9,UndeadNightmare937,2,Fri Jun 26 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much why I love Kyon so much. He's arguably the strongest of the bunch, yet he's also the weakest. It's one of those elements that makes the series that much more interesting. Seeing all the powers being used in the world from the point of view of just a regular person.   His more ""human"" nature allows for the journey to be that much more satisfying to witness once he actually succeeds. It's what allows him to be so relatable to the viewer. It really does make you love him more."
Haruhi,3b4la9,UndeadNightmare937,2,Fri Jun 26 17:26:01 2015 UTC,"To me it's kind of interesting how Kyon can have moments where he's an even bigger asshole than Haruhi at her worst.    That punch thing, for instance.  Haruhi was being absolutely terrible to poor Mikuru but it's really not cool to go around punching girls.    Maybe he's one of those people who is calm-calm-calm and then utterly loses their shit.  When it comes to ""pressing enter,"" by the way, we get that good scene about Kyon confronting his own feelings for Haruhi-powers world versus the plain old one, but so far as I can remember Kyon doesn't even really consider how other people might feel.  Okay, it's pretty obvious that Haruhi prefers her North High existence, but there's a reason Nagato set that world up in the first place, and the kinds of shit she's going through doesn't really register with Kyon.  (Itsuki seems to be in worse shape too, but only a bit.)  So is it a jerk move to hit the enter key?  I'm not sure.  One of those worlds was going to be eliminated either way, so choosing the more exciting one might not have been too mean when it comes to Nagato.  The experience does, after all, make him realize that she is under-appreciated and he needs to pull his weight a little more in managing the brigade's problems."
Haruhi,3b4la9,Bioman2222,3,Thu Jun 25 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain that he would've punched Haruhi in Sigh. The way he was yelling at her, and the surprise he showed when he was stopped really drive home the point that he was letting his rage fuel his actions during that scene. It's even more apparent in the anime, since we actually see his face and the shots showing him making the fist and getting increasingly more irritated.   As much as I don't support the hitting of girls, I'm actually glad that scene happened the way it did. I'm also very appreciative of Koizumi's actions during that part. If everyone just simply allowed Haruhi to do whatever the hell she wanted, her actions would've just got worse as the series went on. Sigh helped establish that Kyon was willing to stand up to Haruhi and oppose her when she went too far, something that Haruhi wasn't expecting. As Koizumi stated, Haruhi always expected for Kyon to be at her side, which is why instead of getting angry and creating Closed Space, she gets depressed and can't face Kyon during school.   It's actually a rather nice moment the next day when you see how happy she gets when Kyon comes to the club room to show his support. Even if she seems to go back to how she was acting before, again like Koizumi states, she actually is just happy to see that Kyon isn't mad at her anymore. She does learn from that experience, LN Spoilers  As for Kyon choosing the old world, I actually think that that decision shows how he isn't a jerk. Sure, his decision to go back might seem selfish because he states that it's more fun, but it actually just happens to align with the less ""jerk-y"" decision. If he stayed in the new world, he would've just been leaving behind the entire year of development he had with the SOS Brigade. He would've effectively killed off the people he had spent so much time with in that last year. The other version of them in the new world might've seemed like they were the old Brigade members, but they were more illusions than anything. They weren't the original members he met, just imposters.   That's my thinking, anyway."
Haruhi,3b4la9,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:18:52 2015 UTC,"Haruhi x Kyon: I think Kyon likes Haruhi more than he's willing to admit. Why do I think this?   In the beginning of Disappearance, In the end of Disappearance, In the end of Surprise,  Would Kyon have actually connected with that closed fist punch in Sigh if Itsuki hadn't been there?:            Hm... I don't think. I think Haruhi did push Kyon's beserk button too many times, but I think Kyon would have realized what he was about to do. I'm not sure though.  Is Kyon a jerk for pressing the Enter key in Disappearance?:    To Yuki? Sort of. As he points out in the end of Disappearance, To everyone else? No. Why? In Dissapearance"
Haruhi,3b4la9,LukeRhinehart34,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:19:15 2015 UTC,"To your second point for Haruhi x Kyon, I'm not sure if Haruhi was the main reason for him choosing to revert things back to the way they were. Haruhi was definitely a part of his decision, but she wasn't THE reason for him hitting that enter key. Kyon states that the old world is simply more fun and interesting. The fact that individuals from fiction that Kyon used to fantasize meeting actually existed in his world was just an opportunity he couldn't pass up. He was able to meet not just one of these characters, but three, with Haruhi making it even more fun. That's why he chose to go back, because as much as he complains about the struggle he goes through, he couldn't deny to himself how much fun he had with the SOS Brigade.  I guess I'm just trying to play Devil's Advocate with that one.  Also, LN Spoilers  It's pretty much inevitable."

Haruhi,3amuzy,appropriate-username,5,Mon Jun 29 00:05:07 2015 UTC,"Ideally, I'd like KyoAni back for season 3. If we can't get them though, I feel that Satellite would make a good replacement. I'd expect the art style to shift back more in the direction of the KyoAni seasons than remain Yuki-chan style though."
Haruhi,3amuzy,SaiyamanMS,2,Mon Jun 22 12:44:48 2015 UTC,"Silver Link? After 17 brilliant episodes of Kokoro, I think they could easily continue Haruhi in a similar style to what the fan base crave."
Haruhi,3amuzy,aceROB,2,Wed Jun 24 14:22:51 2015 UTC,"Ideally it'd be KyoAni, but I'd be fine with Statlight as well."
Haruhi,3amuzy,Kafke,3,Sun Jun 28 08:51:03 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind Statlight doing a season 3 of Haruhi in a similar style to Nagato Yuki-chan. I loved the kyo-ani style but I also really like the style in statlight too.  Just my opinion though =3
Haruhi,3amuzy,Zanamee,3,Mon Jun 22 09:47:39 2015 UTC,"Another studio definately. Nagato-Yuki has very little to offer, it's kind of a watered down version of the other series. Whether that's the source material or not? I don't know, I haven't read it, but Nagato-Yuki as a series is pretty bad honestly. New studio."
Haruhi,3amuzy,ThatGuyfromNI,6,Sun Jun 21 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"You do know the studio primarily (for the most part, unless its like an anime only ending or something) works on the animation, right? Nagato-Yuki is a spinoff LN/Manga, and the studio didn't touch any of the plot.  You're hating on Statlight for something that they didn't do."
Haruhi,3amuzy,QuadrupleJMC,6,Mon Jun 22 01:12:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and not only that, but the animation is supposed to look like the manga."
Haruhi,3amuzy,Zinx10,2,Mon Jun 22 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"As I said, ""whether that's the source material or not, I don't know"". I don't blame them if they had poor source material, I haven't read it, I wouldn't know.   Despite that I have many more issues with Nagato than the plot. A studio can do much more than the animation (and I like the animation style of Nagato too, I'm glad it's different).   Nagato is too slow, not particularly funny, and the characters, annoying, all unlike the original series. For all I know the LN is amazing, but the studio butchered it (ie. Tokyo Ghoul seems to be in that boat).   I don't hate Statlight for what I'll stand by as a poor show (dropped it), but given the knowledge I have the natural conclusion would be to have a new studio, considering I don't know the source material."
Haruhi,3amuzy,ThatGuyfromNI,2,Mon Jun 22 07:20:43 2015 UTC,"Are the studio's THAT helpless in effecting change to liven up the story?  A producer and a director give the anime the look and feel.    Nagato-Yuki looks and feels, on its absolute utter best day, bland, if  not slightly below average (does anyone have a word to grunt ratio for Yuki??? I think at least 50% of her dialog are grunts)"
Haruhi,3amuzy,FatBabyBrother,2,Mon Jun 22 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Well, iirc they do have some creative input, but people want to see the manga they like as anime, so studios usually try to keep the mangaka's (the manga writer or whatever you call him) art style.  For example, the studio that makes Jojo's won't change the art style to one that would be seen in a slice of life genre.  No, its gonna be that manly, yet oddly satisfying/arousing art style.  I agree that Nagato-Yuki isn't the best anime aesthetically, but there isn't really that much content to work off of."
Haruhi,3amuzy,QuadrupleJMC,3,Mon Jun 22 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but a lot of anime is produced mainly to increase the popularity/sales of its source material, be it manga or light novels.  Why make the anime different from the source material if the sole purpose of it is to promote said source material?  This could also explain why we see very few anime that have original stories."
Haruhi,3amuzy,Compupaq,2,Mon Jun 22 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"A great example of this is No Game No Life.  It ended after like 1 continent, and probably won't get another season.  Its a shame because the NGNL light novel translation has so many grammatical errors that its unreadable."
Haruhi,3amuzy,QuadrupleJMC,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:07:44 2015 UTC,But I was always told that they make an anime to drive people to BUY the manga.... not for manga readers who already have the total story.

Haruhi,3ag316,bazzadwarf,8,Fri Jun 19 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect the arc to go this way. The fact that her personality seems to be blending with the other Nagato makes for quite a fascinating element to watch. Just imagining myself in that position is pretty scary. It's almost equal to dying, as your whole mentality starts to change. Now that we're spending some time in this Yuki's head, it makes the process even more frightening, as we hear her fears starting to accumulate. That last line describes just that.  I find Kyon not being able to remember getting Nagato her library card a bit unbelievable. How often does he get library cards for random strangers? Seriously?  Also, I was really hoping to see Small LN Spoilers Guess that's still a ways off, huh?"
Haruhi,3ag316,UndeadNightmare937,2,Sat Jun 20 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"It actually kind of reminded me of the anime Golden Time, where the main charecter have a problem aswell with his past-self, due to his memory loss. Go watch it, it's a great Anime! Sneaky Link to the Anime"

Haruhi,3ag316,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat Jun 20 00:07:37 2015 UTC,"I loved this episode. I don't remember it being this fleshed out in the manga, but it was a welcome addition."
Haruhi,3ag316,deathowm,2,Sat Jun 20 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna take this thread as I'm the only one who didn't really like this episode. The whole show itself sort of stagnated for the past few episodes. A random nonsensical aspect was thrown in presumably to shake things up, and then... nothing. Just a few bland episodes with more or less a type of Yuki that's clearly trying to emulate the main series yuki. Aannnddd.... nothing, really. The only thing I could really think this entire episode is that the writer is some sort of idiot.  How is she 'getting memories back' if she could already remember everything? Why is there just now (after like 3 episodes) some sort of collision between the two yukis? Why are they even separate in the first place?   It seems to me it's trying to get at an issue of identity, and the worry of an identity death as yuki becomes healthy again. but in terms of the writing, it's just.... awful. If the whole show was like this I'd have been incredibly disappointed.  It kind of reminded me of watching the Endless 8 or Someday in the Rain where nothing really happens, but the directing/animating sets an amazing tone. Except this tone was set 3 episodes a go when stuff was happening, and extended a bit for an effect. Now it's just sort of dragging it on for no particular reason.  Obnoxious, really. This is the first time in this spin-off I actually started to look at the clock to see how much longer I had to sit through it (something I do when I'm terribly bored of what's happening on screen).  Felt like it was trying to copy some effects done in the main series and kind of just failed at it... Hopefully next week's episode will be better.  On a side note, there was a scene where Kyon was sitting in the library by himself. That little scene, with the music and all, reminded me a lot of the visual novel 'Katawa Shoujo' for some reason..."
Haruhi,3ag316,Kafke,3,Mon Jun 22 10:37:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on all points. I haven't exactly liked this series but it wasn't bad, until now. I don't mind deep anime that make you think but it doesn't fit here. I too was checking the timer a lot."
Haruhi,3ag316,wolfavenger90,3,Tue Jun 23 00:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yup. Up until now it's sort of been just a fun spin-off that's enjoyable but clearly not the main series. With this new arc, it felt like it was trying to go for a serious tone, which worked for a while, but now it's sort of revealing that they didn't quite know where they were going with it.  it was nice at first, but by now it's just sort of dragging on."
Haruhi,3ag316,Kafke,3,Tue Jun 23 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure how the arc plays out in the manga, but here, I agree with you. It feels like they wanted to do something as shocking and impactful as the Disappearance arc in the original series, but weren't exactly sure how to do it.  I can't really blame them, though, since it's rather difficult to create a situation as tense and dramatic when your whole premise involves throwing out all the elements that made your predecessor unique."
Haruhi,3ag316,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. I actually didn't expect much of the anime since I've read the manga and know how the storie goes. Sooo, I'm not dissapointed in it. But, still, it doesn't feel right! lol  Btw I love watching/hearing the well-known-original-nagato for a while.

Haruhi,39m1wv,bazzadwarf,4,Fri Jun 12 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"Well this is embarrassing... Provided the subs I'm using are accurate (horriblesubs, as always is linked up top), the writers have completely misdiagnosed Yuki's problem. Dysmnesia (memory impairment) isn't even close, given that Yuki clearly states that she has no problems retaining ""old yuki's"" memories.  As I suspected, it's pretty much a clear cut case of shock/depression, but also (seeing Yuki's perspective this time) dissociation (not identifying as one's self), which does indeed come along with depression at times.  And again, the sharp contrast with main series yuki IMO clearly notes that it's not a supernatural thing. And the fact that there was an actual diagnosis made, rather than ""nothing seems wrong"" means that they indeed were trying to chalk it up to a mental/shock problem (just getting it completely wrong :P).  The episode as a whole retained that same dreary feel. Which is hard to sit through, but i appreciate it.  And the beginning was absolutely fantastic, and kind of reminded me a bit of the E8 with how it was sort of just the same thing a second time.  No Tsuruya makes me sad. Had to go watch the dub episode to cheer me up again.   so I would also like to take this time to remind everyone to go and give some love over to r/tsuruya   T_T still a dead sub. Soz."

Haruhi,39m1wv,bluebells2520,2,Sat Jun 13 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"You know I really didn't think you were right with your comments last week but I can definitely see where you're coming from now.  I particularly liked early in the ep where we had the slightly muted voices and dulled colors--it reminded me of times in my life when I was horribly underslept and felt like a spectator in my own body.  Very good mood-setting and yeah, if the entire world felt like that it's almost certainly depression.  Not much of a surprise that it would be misdiagnosed, if that was what the writers were going for.  As I understand, there is much less attention paid to psychological problems (as opposed to physical ones) in Japan."
Haruhi,39m1wv,bonghits96,2,Sat Jun 13 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yup.  It's pretty clear that's what they were going for, but naturally them being Japan, they wouldn't really have a proper diagnosis or anything.  Unless, again, I'm somehow horribly off-base and that scene was in there for some other reason. It's hard to say what exactly the writer's intention is with this arc.  But yea, as I said, it's pretty obvious when you're aware of what it's like. And this episode sort of just confirmed it all. Naturally, of course, it's a bit dramatized, and not a 100% perfect understanding (they called dysmnesia, of all things :P).  I'm still glad to see that I was indeed correct, and it wasn't just a sloppy attempt at trying to write main series yuki."

Haruhi,39m1wv,Kafke,2,Sun Jun 14 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Running a quick google translate on that page, it does seem to simply be ""memory impairment"" and related amnesia issues. Which isn't what Yuki has at all. Given that she reassures us she still has all the memories."
Haruhi,39m1wv,FatBabyBrother,5,Sun Jun 14 00:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not feeling it.  I have little empathy for Yuki and the story/plot is just a slice of a really, really boring life.  Yeah, you can see some Easter eggs for TMOHS but that's just not enough to keep me going....    Without any sort of Haruhi tie in this series would be considered an outright flop in my book.  I would have hoped that the 'disappearance' would be more than not getting hit by a car.... something along the lines of the Yuki/Kyon relationship taking off and transforming sad/retarded Yuki into happy/confident Yuki at Kyon's side.    I'll trudge through it.... just so I can bolster my nerd cred and say that I was able to grind through this snooze fest.    Thank Haruhi that Plastic Memories is more than taking up the slack."

Haruhi,39m1wv,FatBabyBrother,3,Fri Jun 12 22:30:26 2015 UTC,I am having a very tough time keeping interest in the series.  What about the story is so mesmerizing?   Ryoko being a helicopter 'parent'?  Yuki's dialog being little more than grunts most of the time?  I haven't read the manga so maybe there is some sort of payoff that makes it all worth while??    But given the traditional duds that are anime endings I can't for the life of me think of what could happen as a surprise ending.
Haruhi,39m1wv,SaiyamanMS,3,Thu Jun 18 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"This week covered chapters 28 and 29. Did a pretty good job of covering the material.

Haruhi,39m1wv,UndeadNightmare937,3,Sat Jun 13 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"My opinion on the series?  Just enough Haruhi. Human Nagato is too quirky and machine/post-accident Nagato is too robotic. Why can't we have Haruhi's canon human Nagato, the super shy girl?  As for this episode... nothing happened much. Felt a bit like a waste, or a filler. Either you make some progress on her state or you bring the series back to it's comedic roots. Now it's just depressing.  How many episodes are left?"
Haruhi,39m1wv,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah this episode gave me a pretty melancholic feeling too. Not sure where theyre headed to either, so well just have to wait"

Haruhi,39fdn6,UndeadNightmare937,5,Thu Jun 11 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if they've to be sexualised, I don't want to know why Hakase from Nichijou is in there.  Also against Sayaka... GG Hakase."

Haruhi,399vjj,thatdudewithknees,3,Wed Jun 10 08:21:19 2015 UTC,"Kyon definitely does seem to realize the change in Haruhi's powers. Throughout the novels, it's hinted that he notices several changes in her character, LN Spoiler The fact that Kyon stays by Haruhi's side, especially once LN Spoiler further shows how strong the bond he has with her is, the bond that Koizumi loves to bring up so much. Seriously, the guy is all about these two getting close.  It's also interesting to note the power Haruhi has over the Celestials. Her subconsciousness seems to cause them to wreak havoc in Closed Space. Koizumi states that it's her way of blowing off steam when she's frustrated.LN Spoiler  To your last point, I never actually understood that, or at least not as much as I hoped I would. It doesn't make sense to me that someone can just take Haruhi's powers like that. Is that just a plothole, or is there any specific reason given as to why they don't do just that? It would help avoid the threat Kyon makes to the Integrated Data Thought Entity.LN Spoiler So again, why is Haruhi's power so vulnerable to being taken, and how?  I'll jump back in once the discussion gets going. I'm interested in how this turns out."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"To me it seems like the Integrated Data Thought Entity operates on an entirely different mindset than humans. While it is true that it can take Haruhi's powers so easily but simply chooses to observe. The aliens do not seem to be interested in stealing Haruhi's powers at all. Their motives at face value seem to be to observe, but to what end we do not know. This is especially true when you consider that Nagato acted out of her own will in Disapperance and LN Spoiler"
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:43:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose that does make sense. We can't properly understand the IDTE and it's very well possible that they want to see how an organic being like Haruhi uses the power she has. Then, once they have enough information on how to create data with it, they might act out a plan to take it in order to evolve.   That still begs the question as to why LN Spoiler"
Haruhi,399vjj,Ergoemos,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with this sort of interpretation. The IDTE could, theoretically, steal the power to recreate and create permanent changes to the universe whenever they want, but I didn't get the impression that Yuki or the IDTE could create data as a result of it.   As for how the Light Novels end...Well..."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"That's the same conclusion I came to regarding the ending of Surprise. At least the series is known for using tropes and then making fun of their use of such tropes.   I enjoyed that book, nonetheless."

Haruhi,399vjj,bonghits96,3,Fri Jun 12 13:06:57 2015 UTC,"It's always been strange to me, because Haruhi Suzumiya is a character I kind of hated for a long time. This is odd, given how much I love the show in general. I totally get why people love her, her brassy, bossy, and bright-eyed exterior, contrasted with her cynical, vulnerable, and earnest side, she makes for a compelling and utterly charismatic character. I like a lot about her.  I hate a lot about her too. Her conscious and unconscious abuse of her companions drives me crazy, and her outward and obvious ignorance of their needs and wants is so utterly alien that I can not relate. I mean, the most obvious tangible power she abuses relentlessly is her ability to abuse Mikuru. I actively have to look away at these scenes, which, admittedly, are in spirit part and parcel for far more anime than I care to know about.   I know that these are uncomfortable and generally dismissed factors in Haruhi's makeup, but they are important. Hell, one of the most important themes in The Sigh arc is, at its very core, how abusive Haruhi is of Mikuru. We don't get an apology, or any sort of cathartic character development for Haruhi in the end, because Kyon basically forgives her for intoxicating a friend, at the very very kindest. Haruhi might have taken it further if Kyon hadn't been there.   I know it is sort of addressed in the novels, but I see it as very casually dismissed the light novel's continued story. I think  Anyway. Its strange for me, someone who sincerely loves this show, to hate the titular character, and yet...   I still think Haruhi's character is interesting and charismatic and well done, I just don't like the characterization. I try to think of her (in terms of the novels and show) as more of a force of nature and plot device for the action revolve around, rather than a fully fleshed-out character. Not because she isn't fully fleshed-out, but because I don't like to consider the honest ramifications of her actions on the other characters as anything but unavoidable and tragic."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,4,Wed Jun 10 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why you were getting downvotes on this.  I don't know about the books, but I think you're completely right: Haruhi is, at minimum, a complete jerk as the show starts.  In real life a smart person would've been wise to heed Taniguchi's advice to head for the hills when it comes to her.  Her treatment of the computer club guys and Mikuru is intolerable.  I guess part of it with the latter is just pure jealousy, but that doesn't excuse it.  One of the things I thought was neat about Yuki-chan is how having one or two more assertive people around meant that Haruhi wasn't able to run roughshod over everyone.  Asakura and Tsuraya aren't putting up with her shit, and so she calms down toward everyone."
Haruhi,399vjj,Ergoemos,2,Wed Jun 10 23:15:52 2015 UTC,"Your thought process is completely understandable. Haruhi is one of those polarizing characters you rarely come across that you either really love or hate for their actions, sort of like Shinji from Evangelion. Haruhi is presented at the beginning of the story as, for lack of a better term, a total cunt. Her treatment of others is despicable, sometimes bordering on psychotic, and yet that's the point. Her attitude is something that, thankfully, gets addressed early on in the series in Sigh, like you've pointed out.  Haruhi is put against arguably the closest person she's ever had in her life, Kyon, because of this foul and abusive conduct she's retained. That moment is played out very seriously, and the change in tone is jarring, at best. Once Kyon apologizes, however, it almost seems as if the ramifications of her actions were simply thrown out the window and she continued with her horrible nature.  It's important to remember that this series is very subtle. Subtle to the point that considering it as such can be seen as excusing poor writing. The best case of this subtle character development is shown in the anime, leading into the Disappearance movie. Before the movie, the characters seem to stay relatively the same throughout their adventures, but once you watch the movie and think about it, especially with Nagato, you realize just how much they've been through. Kyon finally admitting to himself that he enjoys his old, chaotic world is one of the most defining moments in the series, as his attitude adjustment carries on within his character throughout everything after that arc. It's the most easily visible case of development in a character the franchise contains.   Keeping that subtlety in mind, looking at Haruhi's character reveals similar results. That moment in Sigh may not seem important at first, but it's because of this that Haruhi's character takes a turn for the better. Her treatment of Mikuru begins to improve, just not abruptly. That change in her is something that always came across as genuine and believable to me. We as people change with the situations we're involved in. We're shaped by our surroundings and the outcomes of any relationships we have. This is what I consider to be behind such a great development in character. I'm not saying that this series is the pinnacle of stellar writing, because it's not. Like any other work, it has its problems. It's not perfect. LN Spoilers  All of this is why I love her character. The fact that we can look at her actions and dissect them in such a way is what's so fascinating about her. Her relentless attitude and strong determination is a difficult hurdle for many individuals around her, and watching her gradual change as the novels go on is what I consider to be so heartwarming about her."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,3,Thu Jun 11 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"I can absolutely see what you mean. I am not certain I agree it is quite so subtle, but I see what you mean.   I think what I really wanted to see was an actual catharsis moment, a place where she acts outside of her preestablished character traits. Let me describe what I mean.   We see a lot of the other brigade members in a different light, a personal light, throughout the series. I'd argue that Koizumi is generally the least often ""uncharacteristic"", which fits his role. We see him act out of character in the alternate world in the Disappearance (which makes sense, given the setting) where he clearly states he is jealous of Kyon and he quite likes Haruhi, an act he is well aware of being unrequited. It is a painful moment, but an honest one that we barely reflect on. Another time is at the very end  Mikuru we see break character when You see more of this throughout the series, especially in her book, The Intrigues.   I think that Yuki can claim to have the most ""uncharacteristic"" development overall. I mean, she did have her own movie. But I want to focus on those last scenes on the roof. She looks cold and emotionless, still and placid. She might well be reading a book... except Kyon can see it really is a mask this time, a stone face on the convicted's face, who expects to be put before the judge and be debugged, reprogrammed, then reinstalled, more or less killed in the process. She is secretly afraid, and that is a scary thing to see on the supposedly strongest person on the Brigade (aside from the leader). You also get to see that mask come on again as Yuki faces  I guess what I want is another moment like those, but for Haruhi. A moment where she isn't angry and sullen and hurt that she can't treat people the way she wants to treat them, but where she is obviously scared and worried she crossed some line that she wouldn't be forgiven for. A moment where she drops the indignation and appears honestly delighted at something wondrous and not possessive two seconds later. A single self-effacing moment where she makes a joke at her own expense. An uncharacteristic moment not undercut by something grand and dangerous happening underneath the surface.   But I know why she is so well loved. Her character development just doesn't quite hit the notes and chords I wanted to see, I guess. I don't begrudge anyone else's love for her. She just missed those marks I wanted to see."
Haruhi,399vjj,Ergoemos,2,Thu Jun 11 09:53:30 2015 UTC,"I see. You want a more humanizing moment for her. I wholehaeartedly agree on that sentiment. She hasn't been given a moment as serious and as breaking as the other members of the Brigade, or at least not one as clear as those.   Sigh was supposed to be that for her, but even then, she never showed that break in her personality. I love those examples you brought up. Mikuru and Koizumi were characters I wasn't expecting to get an introspective look on, yet they were handled very well. I'll leave discussing the other Brigade members for future threads, since I don't want to exhaust all I have to say about them just yet.  As for Haruhi, I'm expecting her to get that moment once she finds out about her powers. Everyone gets that breakthrough moment because they're aware of how dangerous their position really is. They know the consequences could very well cause some bloodshed, and are frustrated at their subsequent higher ups limiting their involvement. I hope that once more LNs are released, Tanigawa will try to focus more on Haruhi's development. It feels like as the novels went on, he started tending to the rest of the bridage. I'm fine with that, of course, since it added more dimension to their personalities, but I think the focus should move back, at least for one novel, on Haruhi.    Well, I suppose I've said pretty much all I've wanted to. Thanks for the posts, it's nice to see a different perspective on her as a character. Even if I don't agree that she hasn't been developed quite as well as the others, I still understand why you view her as such."
Haruhi,399vjj,GrayStandard,2,Thu Jun 11 19:23:15 2015 UTC,And thank you for the friendly and honest replies. I fully respect your position on this too and appreciate the fair and kindly debate!
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,3,Thu Jun 11 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"So my post won't be nearly as elaborate as some of the others here. However, I have a few thoughts I'd still like to share.  As a whole, I love Haruhi as a character. Her attitude towards life is what draws me closest to her. She is always happy, (well, most of the time) excited and out going about the things she loves. Things that she feels like would enrich her life. I don't have anywhere near the amount of enthusiasm she has in my life about anything. So I have always found her extremely admirable for that.  But for those same reasons she can be hard to get a handle on for a lot of people. The very things I just mentioned can be exhausting for some people, so they misunderstand and loose interest in her. That is where the problems start occurring for her. No matter how well intended she might be, she scares some people off because she doesn't always quite know how to properly exhibit her excitement, which often times has led to her hurting others. (Mikuru, in particular.)  A lot of what she considers to be acceptable behavior, such as stealing one of the Computer Club's computers, for whatever reason never occurs to her as being something wrong to do. Perhaps you could chock it up to her being a social ""outcast"" or perhaps her not understanding other's feelings at times, but no matter how you slice it, what she did was wrong. I think the single most biggest thing she did that bothered me was her putting Sake in Mukuru's drink just for the sake of her movie. I definitely wouldn't have thrown a punch at her like Kyon nearly did, but I was still highly disturbed that she thought that was acceptable thing to do. I was extremely disappointed in her that day.  That being said, I still feel like she is largely just misunderstood and doesn't understand how to properly let her excitement out without hurting others. I have never once thought that she was hurting others out of malicious intent. While that doesn't justify some of things she has done, it still redeems her in my book.  I sometimes wish she would just pop into existence, because we need more people in this world with her enthusiasm. Flaws and all, it would be a ton of fun to have her around. Kyon is one fortunate guy."
Haruhi,399vjj,GrayStandard,5,Thu Jun 11 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I view her character. It's rather sad, once you think about it. Her personality came to be like that because of how she shut herself from others. Kyon is probably the only person since that baseball game who's actually talked to her and treated her in the same way as he would to others, while still standing his ground against her bizarre and problematic nature. He's probably the only friend she's made in years.   This is what forms that strong bond she has with him, and then leads to her change as the series goes on. As lucky as we might think Kyon is for finding someone like her, she's even more lucky for finding someone like Kyon. I don't even want to imagine what type of person she would've been without Kyon being involved.   That being said, she would be a pretty interesting person to meet in real life. As long as she had someone like Kyon to calm her, that is."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that Kyon's presence definitely had a effect on her. I never seen her eccentric nature to be the problem, though. There's nothing wrong with being a oddball like her. Her eccentric nature just made her all the more cool in my book. It's just as I said earlier, how she sometimes chose to express it wasn't done in a particularly great manner. Expression of herself is what she needed help with and Kyon did a excellent job of getting her back on track."
Haruhi,399vjj,UndeadNightmare937,3,Thu Jun 11 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. I meant the brutal, insulting part of her personality, not her eccentric behavior. The part that Kyon helped her improve, which was talking and caring for others. That's the sweet part of their relationship, how they both helped change each other for the better."
Haruhi,399vjj,fatblackninja,2,Thu Jun 11 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"Since it's impossible to sticky two threads, I decided to link it in the announcement bar along with the episode downloads. Hopefully these discussion threads gain a lot of traffic =D"

Haruhi,3982ix,bazzadwarf,2,Wed Jun 10 00:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah... A lot of people really want to have Haruhi doused (or tied up) in 50 shades, apparently."

Haruhi,399tqw,leopold_s,15,Wed Jun 10 07:57:13 2015 UTC,"Not to me. It's an unpopular opinion, but I have been enjoying Disappearance of Nagato by its own merit from the very first episode. I don't expect season 3 from it."
Haruhi,399tqw,thatdudewithknees,12,Wed Jun 10 08:22:44 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the problem. People going in expecting more Haruhi are going to be sorely disappointed. It's totally different, and good in its own way. But the last episode was something completely different, and I have no idea what to expect moving forward. Totally immersed. Things are seriously happening now, and the sugar and rainbows seem to be over. But I feel like without the first episodes being what they were, the impact wouldn't have been nearly so great. I'm loving it."
Haruhi,399tqw,EzioSC5,3,Wed Jun 10 10:02:20 2015 UTC,"I don't expect season 3 from Nagato Yuki-chan, but I do expect season 3 to appear sometime.  ;-;"

Haruhi,399tqw,Zinx10,3,Fri Jun 12 03:25:32 2015 UTC,"I can't help but wonder why I didn't hear this complaining around the time of Haruhi-chan and Churuya-san. Maybe it's because this is the first new thing from this brand in quite some time, but it's still strange to me that people could have expected that Yuki-chan would be anything more than a spin off despite having spin off written all bloody over it."
Haruhi,399tqw,bigbaddickwolf,5,Wed Jun 10 13:17:46 2015 UTC,Some people don't know about either Haruhi-chan or Churuya-san because they're web only. This may be their only experience since The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya movie.

Haruhi,399tqw,harsh183,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:00:34 2015 UTC,"Because ""Taaki"" as they've been calling her is considered generally annoying to those people.  I love seeing her with emotions, but I do see where they come from when they say that. (I don't care I get more Yuki buuuuuut) They're like ""it doesn't feel the same"" or ""the art style sucks"" or ""it's just a generic romcom anime"" or ""Kyon (or insert X here) is totally out of character."" That seems to be the main issues. They do however seem to agree that more Asakura and Tsuruya is a good thing.  I love every minute of it."
Haruhi,399tqw,Poketoa,3,Fri Jun 12 02:48:12 2015 UTC,"People really should have expected something different. I mean seriously, it has THE NAME OF YUKI NAGATO RIGHT ON THE TITLE, DO YOU REALLY THINK HARUHI IS GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST ATTRACTION?  Also, to answer that question - it's supposed to be some sort of slice-of-life thing, not the [insert all genres here] of Haruhi - it's really should just be considered on its own, and not as an integral part of the Haruhi Suzumiya series."
Haruhi,399tqw,1tobedoneX,5,Thu Jun 11 01:08:04 2015 UTC,"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya features very little of Haruhi for most of the movie, but I don't think anyone criticizes it for that.  My problem with the new Nagato series is that so little happens. And I even like slice of life animes, I'm a fan of K-On."
Haruhi,399tqw,Poketoa,2,Thu Jun 11 07:54:19 2015 UTC,"Sadly, people feel it doesn't hold well up on its own, and that it's too generic and relies far too much on previous knowledge of the series.   Thing is, it's exactly what I wanted to see it animated. In-story it makes sense, this is Yuki's ideal world, and given her Haruhi-chan incarnation, the idea that she would want a romantic comedy setup would be spot on."
Haruhi,399tqw,fly2me,2,Fri Jun 12 02:50:03 2015 UTC,"I am really having a hard time getting into, or even accepting the premise of this series. The character of Nagato Yuki is completely flat. There is no depth to her. This is an inherent problem when you produce media that is supposed to draw in audiences. Nagato is a shy, ""cute"" girl gamer, who has an infatuation with the only male counterpart in her life. I get it, she wished to be a normal school girl and live a normal life; but, she just comes across as a simple and annoying girl.   Basically, the show took everything great and successful about Haruhi and stripped it down to a one dimensional splice-of-life type show. The problem is that the plot is lacking, the characters are lackluster, and it simply fails in producing an interesting new narrative. I would be completely on board for a different show or manga, don't get me wrong. It just isn't well written or executed. I'm at episode 7 now, and I don't even know what the show is about or where it's going.   Despite the fanboy in me, I just can't allow myself to feign admiration for a show of such blatant mediocrity - High school romance anime with nothing special going for it other than recognizing iconic characters from a similar universe.  The problem with this show is that many of the characters have altered personalities that never peak like the ones in the original series. Yet, Haruhi is nearly the same. She has a magnetic personality, and truly steals the show. It's a constant tease and just leaves me feeling empty and wanting."
Haruhi,3955f0,thatdudewithknees,7,Tue Jun 9 09:30:40 2015 UTC,Sounds fun! But only if we start with the most important character: Kunikida.
Haruhi,3955f0,rinshankouhai,5,Tue Jun 9 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"You jest, but that may actually be a good idea. Haruhi and Kyon had been discussed to death, yet there are many layers that has yet to be explored when it comes to side characters."
Haruhi,3955f0,rinshankouhai,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:07:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't jest. I'm no jester. I've never jested in my life.   …Okay, maybe just a little. But I always have been pretty interested in Kunikida; Taniguchi is so exaggerated and archetypal, and by comparison his constant companion seems… surprisingly nuanced and complex. He's so laidback and oddly fleshed out, i can't help but be a little fascinated whenever he shows up."
Haruhi,3955f0,synthwizard,7,Wed Jun 10 01:27:33 2015 UTC,Any new content would be great
Haruhi,3955f0,Zinx10,2,Tue Jun 9 12:16:21 2015 UTC,"I assume we are going to talk about the characters across all forms they have been portrayed, but will this include The Disappearance of Nagato Anime? I would like to discuss the characters from it, but it doesn't really fit in and most people don't seem to like it."
Haruhi,3955f0,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:23:40 2015 UTC,"If plan to include that as well, as a discussion on the side. I would rather not split it into different threads in order to draw clear distinctions from the iteration of the character in question. If there is a discussion thread for Nagato in this sub every week as the episodes are aired, so I do not see why not. However, I have to take into consideration to include the manga as well as the anime, and some parts of the Nagato manga has not been shown, while some parts will probably never be shown in the anime due to the inconsistency of characters not being introduced yet in the anime up to Disappereance."
Haruhi,3955f0,Zinx10,2,Tue Jun 9 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea, but I think one thing everyone should do is to refrain from character discussions that don't exist in anime form.  I say this since the anime version is clearly the most popular and viewed version.  Of course, the specific comments can have spoilers (only if in a spoiler tag).  I just don't want anyone to get spoiled when they don't want to."
Haruhi,3955f0,DarkStar5758,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"I agree to some extent, but I do think we should have some discussion for those types of characters, even if it's just an aside.

Besides, try the light novels, they're good :)  I don't know if what I am saying is selfish, but with little possibility for season 3, is there actually any point to not discussing the LN which are up to about a decade old, that a lot of people never planned on picking up to read anyways?"

Haruhi,38yy62,Bioman2222,5,Mon Jun 8 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"Most likely different universe. It is quite obviously based on the main universe, but still a spinoff nonetheless. For an instance, ""old"" Nagato isn't a non-talking doll unable to express emotions like the main universe Nagato.   I do wish they did season 3 and 4 before spinoffs though. That way, a Season 2 for the spinoff would actually be possible, since Sasaki has yet to be introduced in any animated works."
Haruhi,38yy62,thatdudewithknees,2,Mon Jun 8 07:55:21 2015 UTC,I personally consider it as a different universe.
Haruhi,38pbb2,bazzadwarf,7,Fri Jun 5 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"I love how gloomy the episode felt. It was so foreign to the show and it just felt off. The old Nagato, the atmosphere, the music, it all set up so well that this is not normal and I loved it."
Haruhi,38pbb2,deathowm,2,Sat Jun 6 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"Stick that same Yuki in the main series, and it'd still be off. It's quite clearly not the old Yuki. I pretty much could tell instantly. IMO it's an open/shut case of depression.  Random zap to emotions, have no opinions one way or the other, disregarding any and all things, and ultimately being thankful for when someone simply appreciates you and doesn't push/shove.  Old Yuki wouldn't have answered the questions in the same way. Would've been straight to the point and precise, not vague/wish-washy ""stop talking to me"" way."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,5,Sat Jun 6 11:20:58 2015 UTC,"Obviously spoilers ahead. I don't feel like marking down everything that's a spoiler, since we haven't been doing that in the previous threads.  The long-awaited arc by many of you has finally arrived. I feel bad that once this Nagato showed up, I actually kinda cheered a bit. At first, I was happy to see my old Nagato back (apart from a few differences), but as the episode went on, it started getting depressing, especially with the choice in music.  One thing that bothered me was how she apparently dodged the car, but somehow lost her previous personality? I suppose that'll be explained later on.  All-in-all, this episode was more setup to the actual Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan. It was a nice change of pace to the silliness so far, which I approve of. Seriously, from what I've heard from some of you, this better be good. I can only hope."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,2,Fri Jun 5 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"I think what happened it she WAS hit by the car, but reverted to the humanoid interface and repaired herself (mostly). She must now be in some sort of safe mode, or the sudden shock reverted the changes."
Haruhi,38pbb2,synthwizard,5,Fri Jun 5 21:45:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think this universe has any sort of Sci fi elements to it. This world doesn't have aliens, time travelers and espers. It's just a regular Yuki-chan.  My guess is that somehow she fell and got some sort of brain damage. At least that's what seems to be implied from the preview for the next episode."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:51:52 2015 UTC,Well I am very hopeful.
Haruhi,38pbb2,synthwizard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, I guess they very well could pull something like that. I just don't think the manga has any Sci fi elements."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,3,Fri Jun 5 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"I posted this on r/anime thread, but I guess I was late to the party... anyway: Wouldn't it be cool if original Nagato transferred her consciousness into this Nagato as a way of dealing with endless eight, which is why she reacts to the festival thing?"
Haruhi,38pbb2,tx8xsiempre,4,Sat Jun 6 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"HOLY FUCK!! This episode just put everything on its head! All those mediocre episodes must have been to set up the now previous Nagato. She's gone back to the way she was before, what a difference. This episode so heavy with emotion, at least for me! I cannot wait for the next one!!  Edit: Also the music was FANTASTIC!! Especially when it built up to that part where Kyon touches Yuki's forehead! AGH! Perfect!!!"
Haruhi,38pbb2,synthwizard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:41:47 2015 UTC,That wasn't old yuki.
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,5,Sat Jun 6 11:17:59 2015 UTC,The question Asakura asked Nagato at the end was pretty heavy hitting. She seems to understand that there is something a lot bigger going on with Nagato then her just going through shock.
Haruhi,38pbb2,GrayStandard,4,Sat Jun 6 10:02:27 2015 UTC,"I guess Nagato is back to one-word answers lines, for now at least.  だいじょうぶ。 そう。 そう。 ありがとう。 そう。 どうして。 行こう。 だいじょうぶ。 うん。  I really wonder how it must feel to voice act Nagato, it's like the lines are being recycled."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Ra5han,4,Sat Jun 6 12:05:33 2015 UTC,Did someone else see the changes to the ending? I LOVE when series does that. What does it mean?   Edit: Spelling.
Haruhi,38pbb2,celies,2,Sun Jun 7 20:32:21 2015 UTC,Woah woah woah... Wait a minute. They changed bits?  What bits did they change?
Haruhi,38pbb2,Zanamee,4,Sun Jun 7 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"The first bit when she stands up has been changed with the end where she sits down.   The tear that was at the beginning has been moved to the end.   All the other characters only have outline in different colors (and we now can see what star they represent).   Last: Yuki is observing her own shadow talking to Kyon, and starts to cry.   Edit: Spelling again, I'm way to emotional to write right now.   Edit2: When she stands up the screen also flips to the dark side and her glasses is on the ground at the end."
Haruhi,38pbb2,celies,2,Sun Jun 7 20:48:02 2015 UTC,That was a really powerful change.   Her tears though =(  Thanks for pointing that out =)

Haruhi,38pbb2,celies,3,Mon Jun 8 12:37:12 2015 UTC,"I really liked how Nagato simply read this entire episode just like in the first season ""Someday in the Rain."" Also, 10 episodes and finally a plot."
Haruhi,38pbb2,SomethingAzn,8,Sat Jun 6 07:54:34 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna start my comment off with a joke, because god damn that was painful to watch. So... fun joke time: See, this is what happens when you don't have Tsuruya appear, drab depressing dreariness. I was ready for her to burst in at any moment and save me from the emotional hell hole that was this episode. Nope. Didn't happen.  The other thing I'd like to address is anyone who thinks this is old Yuki. It's not. By a long shot. It's an open and shut case of depression. And the way Yuki acted was painfully real. And what really 'sealed the deal' (pretty much struck a fatal emotional blow) was Asakura's little comment at the end. God damn. WTF? No. seriously. You don't say that to someone. Especially not with that scenario/tone. Ouch.  As for Kyon... he pretty much did everything you should do to help someone through depression. Really heartwarming to see Kyon reach out, despite Yuki's clear lack of responding.  Perhaps I'm off base, and this is simply a case of misleading and/or bad writing. But there's clear differences between: Yuki-chan Yuki, Depressed Yuki-chan Yuki, and Main Series Yuki.  main series Yuki is neutral, not depressed. As such, she responds neutrally, not like someone who is depressed. We also see her begin to struggle with emotions. While similar, this is still pretty different.  Yuki-chan Yuki is pretty different, So I won't go into that. And then we have... this Yuki. If the writers were trying to get 'neutral main series yuki' they have failed. If they were trying to get depressed yuki, that shit is on key.  Not really much else to say about this episode. Other than that as someone who's been through depression, this was honestly painful to watch. It's kind of like people having social anxiety watching Watamote. Except it's not funny.  Quite ironically, I was planning on using this post to mention how much I'm enjoying the upbeat ""happy"" OP. Which, while I liked it at the beginning, has been growing on me more and more.  Edit: TL;DR: If you ever encounter someone who's depressed (legitimate depressed, not just 'sad'), don't do what Asakura did. Do as Kyon did."

Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,3,Sat Jun 6 20:57:19 2015 UTC,lawl.
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,5,Sat Jun 6 21:54:08 2015 UTC,Looks more like a healthy traumatic response to me. Numbness and feeling of being disconnected being common symptoms. Could evolve into a PTSD with depression but it's to soon to tell.
Haruhi,38pbb2,YogurtBatmanSwag,6,Sat Jun 6 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"As I said, it has all the signs of depression. IMO there's a clear difference from just being in a traumatic experience, and being depressed.  The main signs, IMO, were Yuki's one-word answers, her ""meh"" response to enjoyed food, and appreciation for someone reaching out but not being pushy.  You can tell, because it's that sort of ""emptiness"" that old yuki also has (due to lacking emotion). But instead of having precise answers and not really giving a fuck, there's a sort of apathy instead.  If it's just due to a traumatic experience, IMO they pushed it too far. Looks more like depression.  The only weird part is the sudden onset. Depression is usually a gradual thing."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,2,Sat Jun 6 23:59:52 2015 UTC,"It's never ""just"" a traumatic experience. Trauma is the main factor causing depression and can instantly change someone personality.   All the behaviors you are describing are the most common post traumatic reactions. It's a healthy behavior if it's limited in time. If it doesn't go away, then it's depression as part of a post traumatic stress disorder. Formerly known as shell shock, 70% of soldiers suffering from it ended up with depression.  So depression is gradual indeed because sudden symptoms are part of a healthy behavior, it's the fact that they last in time that we call depression, not so much the symptoms themselves.  If Nagato stays like this for an extended period of time, then she is suffering from depression. Might happen if Asakura keeps stressing her."
Haruhi,38pbb2,YogurtBatmanSwag,2,Sun Jun 7 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Very well. I guess I should've clarified. I meant it's clearly the symptoms of depression, rather than ""getting old yuki back"" (who didn't display such symptoms)."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,2,Sun Jun 7 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"You're wrong on one account. Main-series Yuki is depressed at one point- the Endless Eight. Don't steal my hope for a return of DITE-Yuki yet, haruhidammit!  Maybe I'm far too hopeful, but Asakura's ""Who are you?"" at the end made me squeal with glee; any empathy I may have had for (depressed?)Yuki vanished as soon as I heard it and I thought, ""SHE KNOWS."" Because I take it as a hint that Yuki is indeed someone else: the Yuki we all know and love from E8."
Haruhi,38pbb2,humblepudding1,2,Wed Jun 10 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Main-series Yuki is depressed at one point- the Endless Eight   Ah, right right. But still, depressed main series Yuki also is different than regular main series yuki.   Don't steal my hope for a return of DITE-Yuki yet, haruhidammit!   Maybe I'm wrong :P.   but Asakura's ""Who are you?"" at the end made me squeal with glee;    That was a punch in the gut for me. It's generally what you hear when you've come down with depression, and generally become unrecognizable to other people who aren't familiar. You get that same sort of response.   any empathy I may have had for (depressed?)Yuki vanished as soon as I heard it and I thought, ""SHE KNOWS."" Because I take it as a hint that Yuki is indeed someone else: the Yuki we all know and love from E8.   Maybe. That'd be great if it were the case."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,2,Wed Jun 10 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"Haven't yet seen 11, so I may be completely wrong now.  As for depression, I know it causes a lack of interest in everything, but can it change your interests too? In Nagatos case, it seems odd that she would start reading instead of retreating into her PSP more and more. UGGH if only we knew if she could read French before all of this..."
Haruhi,38pbb2,humblepudding1,2,Sat Jun 13 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"The actual answer is pretty straight forward. Can't really talk about it without spoiling what it actually is, but I think it's safe to say it doesn't have a large impact on the direction of the show. I'll mark the actual reason in spoiler tags, so watch ep 11 before you read if you don't want spoilers:  SPOILS"
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:01:29 2015 UTC,"I'd like to agree it's a depressed yuki, but I still don't get what could have triggered it / why the sudden change."
Haruhi,38pbb2,SomethingAzn,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"Depression is like that. Just sort of comes out of nowhere. That's a big misconception with it, actually. That something ""causes"" it. Depression isn't an emotional response. It's lacking emotions entirely and having a sort of default melancholy state. It's hard to describe unless you've been through it.  But I agree, seems like a random time to have it happen. As I mentioned, it might just be that the writers are trying to write 'old yuki' and are just failing miserably at it.  Old yuki lacks emotion, but isn't depressed. So it's sort of similar, but depression causes sort of ""meh"" and wishwashy responses. Old yuki wasn't like that, and had sort of robotic precise responses, and a completely neutral attitude. Old yuki was quiet because she didn't have anything to say. This yuki is quiet because she's quite clearly depressed. It's a pretty big difference.  I guess we'll find out more next episode."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Kafke,2,Sat Jun 6 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"I was just about to post it, beat me to it!  Stickied =D"
Haruhi,38pbb2,Thehoennhippo,2,Fri Jun 5 19:35:38 2015 UTC,"As a manga reader, I was conflicted about the changes made to this episode.  They added a lot more to the part where they were at school.  I don't think the things they added were bad, but I think it streched the whole, whats wrong with Nagato thing to long."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:37:04 2015 UTC,"It was pretty impactful, though.  I'm assuming the anime will go as far as Volume 4, right? I haven't read the manga, but it seems that with six episodes left, they probably won't adapt further. Do you think Volume 4 is long enough for that or do you think they'll be able to adapt a bit further?"
Haruhi,38pbb2,Zinx10,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:07:34 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure there is enough content in volume 4.  I am almost 100% sure they don't want to incorporate volume 5 into this due to some reasons.
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:45:33 2015 UTC,Sort of LN Spoilers
Haruhi,38pbb2,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"We'd need volume 6 for that, which we probably aren't getting at this rate. Spoiler Volume 5 starts with an 'epilogue' of sorts to volume 4's story arc (... Even though all the chapters are called 'epilogues'), followed by Tanabata and then summer vacation."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:50:37 2015 UTC,So is that epilogue the reason why Volume 5 wouldn't be incorporated?
Haruhi,38pbb2,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Sat Jun 6 01:41:21 2015 UTC,"No, I reckon a good chunk of volume 5 has a good chance of making it in. Volume 6 doesn't though. I can't imagine them including Spoiler appearance from the end of volume 5 though just to be a cliffhanger at the end of the final episode."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Zinx10,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"I mean, why would they do that instead of Late LN Spoilers  Also, sorry for messing up thinking that the end of volume 5 happens earlier."
Haruhi,38pbb2,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat Jun 6 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you were referring to LN Spoilers revelation.  Also, to answer your first question, that doesn't happen until very late in the light novels, and since there's no Season 3 as of yet, they can't do it. Hell, if there was a Season 3, I doubt they would even be able to do it there, unless it was some sort of cliffhanger."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Zinx10,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I can perfectly see season 3 being called ""the Rampage of Haruhi Suzumiya"" since new content begins there.  Then, after how ever much content gets completed, they could have a trilogy of movies for the most recent LN's (9, 10, and 11).  I think that is how it should be."
Haruhi,38pbb2,SaiyamanMS,2,Mon Jun 8 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"Once again, only one chapter was covered this week. However, unlike episode 8 where it covered one 8 page chapter, the chapter covered by this week's episode was 20 pages long meaning there was a lot less filler than that time. The episodes was handled great and I'm looking forward to how the arc unfolds in the anime. More has been said on my blog as always."
Haruhi,38pbb2,otakuman,2,Fri Jun 5 23:24:36 2015 UTC,"Some of my thoughts about it:  1) What if this universe is where our Nagato retreated during Endless Eight? You know, as in ""scouting"".  2) Taniguchi and Kunikida are back! I had missed them for a while.  3) Am I the only one who finds this Asakura incredibly appealing?  4) Book of the day: ""The Mystery of the Yellow Room"" by Gaston Leroux. One of the first locked room mystery crime fiction novels. The other book, ""The Perfume of the Lady in Black"" is a sequel."
Haruhi,38pbb2,Vanek_26,4,Sat Jun 6 05:19:02 2015 UTC,Asakura has become my favorite  character  so far in this series.

Haruhi,38pbb2,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:19:36 2015 UTC,"So the 'big thing' was Yuki not getting hit by a car and basically falling down?  The only thing I really noticed was that the Yuki character's dialogue went from 'few' to 'fewer' words... if there was a massive change I couldn't see it.  They still treat Yuki as a 3 year old, and she basically acts the part of a 3 year old.   The great glasses debate was riveting.    About the only thing I like about this series now is how daily Japanese life is depicted... I have to admit I smiled when I saw Asakura use the wet umbrella bag at the convenience store (I never used them).    I think that this episode, while it may have been the most relevant to the plot, was a snooze fest.  I mean thank god she had a backup pair of glasses!"

Haruhi,38gtgn,UndeadNightmare937,3,Thu Jun 4 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, the manga has quite bad reviews because it lacks a majority of Kyon's thoughts."
Haruhi,38gtgn,Zinx10,3,Thu Jun 4 03:14:23 2015 UTC,"That's also what I've heard. A lot of people will tell you to read the LNs because they simply contain more context where it's needed.   In this case, though, I've already read the LNs. I just wanted to know whether people would recommend the manga after I've digested the main series and all the internal monologues."
Haruhi,38gtgn,Zinx10,4,Thu Jun 4 03:31:41 2015 UTC,"From what I read of it, I don't think it is entirely necessary unless you REALLY want a majority of the same content (lacking monologues).

Haruhi,38gtgn,DarkStar5758,2,Thu Jun 4 15:57:16 2015 UTC,"I personally haven't read much of any of them, but from what I hear: LN #8 Spoilers:"
Haruhi,38gtgn,DarkStar5758,3,Thu Jun 4 21:31:18 2015 UTC,The Haruhi-chan manga is good (except for the copious amounts of fanservice) but the regular Haruhi manga is just meh. Try and find the light novels instead.
Haruhi,38gtgn,DarkStar5758,2,Thu Jun 4 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"Haruhi-chan has tons of fanservice? Huh, I never would've thought. The only thing that I could think of from the Haruhi-chan anime that can be considered fanservice is the types of games that Nagato plays.  As for the light novels, I've already read them."
Haruhi,38gtgn,TheKingleMingle,3,Thu Jun 4 22:40:48 2015 UTC,There is at least one swimsuit chapter per volume.

Haruhi,38gtgn,TheKingleMingle,2,Thu Jun 4 23:28:08 2015 UTC,The anime is mostly just parts of volume 1. I think there were a couple from 2 as well but the anime barely scratches the surface of the manga.

I find Nagato still has its charm especially her shy side but it kinda get downplayed by her food fetish and other antics but its still a good anime to watch ."

We had the end of the hot springs trip arc and the setup for what will become the story arc that is covered in volume 4. I've got more feedback on the episode on my translation blog, other than random dinosaurs, this episode stuck pretty close to the manga.  I'm curious as to how anime-only folk reacted to this week's cliffhanger!"

I'm an anime-only folk, but I had spoiled the ""cliffhanger"" for myself. I knew it was coming, but not when. This whole last episode was a lot of ""nonononononnonon.... nevermind, it was just an asakura fantasy. Nonononononono. Nevermind, they are okay. Nononononnonoon.""  Not really sure how I feel about it. Given that there's a whole lot of episodes left, I feel like Yuki's just fine (and the preview shows her okay too). Didn't seem to be as big of an event that people were making it out to be. But who knows?"

Haruhi,37snkw,bluebells2520,3,Tue Jun 2 09:04:48 2015 UTC,"This episode was a bit like the last one, except without as much fan service. And, of course, without the serious moment at the end.   I liked the little bonding moment that Asakura and Haruhi had, the whole jealously thing gives you a new perspective on how supportive Asakura is to Nagato, despite having conflicting feelings.   Overall, nice episode with a few touching moments(That stargazing scene with Yuki reaching out was kinda cute). Also, with the accident that happens at the end, I'm surprised that Yuki seems to have no physical injuries whatsoever.   Regarding the dub, since there's no specific thread about it right now, I actually really liked it. I'm quite surprised by how much I enjoyed their voices. Maybe I just never realized how much I missed the English VAs. Standouts to me were Nagato, Kyon and Asakura. Nagato's voice sounded way better to me in English, which was always the case, but this time it's much more noticeable."
Haruhi,37snkw,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat May 30 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"I really miss the English VAs as well, especially Asakura, Nagato and Koizumi."

Haruhi,37snkw,DarkStar5758,2,Sat May 30 08:47:42 2015 UTC,So looks like I'm the only guy wondering what's up with Koizumi's gayness towards Kyon?
Haruhi,37snkw,bluebells2520,2,Sun May 31 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"I'm rewatching part of the dub and Kyon said a line about 7 minutes in that through me off: ""There's something about the way you wield that knife.""   I thought there's no way that was in the sub, so I checked a Youtube one, and they had something about her humming. Then, I checked HorribleSubs, and they have it as ""bloodcurdling every time I see it.""

I waited for the dub because I like the dub better but they are different characters thus the VAs don't really fit this time... but maybe it's just a matter of time to get use to it..
Haruhi,37snkw,wardaniel9,3,Sat May 30 01:55:18 2015 UTC,The dub was great.  I strongly disagree.
Haruhi,37snkw,Kafke,2,Sat May 30 05:00:20 2015 UTC,"But they are different characters, kyon isn't as Sarcastic and Nagato is a bit more lively (I guess that's the word) than the old one who sounded like a robot... just my opinion maybe the more I watch the more I'll get use to it, idk.."
Haruhi,37snkw,Zinx10,2,Sat May 30 05:04:21 2015 UTC,"It's understandable why you wouldn't like the dub, I'm not gonna tell you that your opinion is wrong.  Personally, I quite liked the performances in the dub. I thought each of the VAs were able to adjust quite nicely. Nagato was probably my favorite to hear, since she was able to keep some of the feel from Melancholy, while still making her voice lively enough to fit the character in Yuki-chan."

Did we watch the same dub? Kyon sounds identical to the main series.

I think there's one or two scenes where he behaved a bit differently than usual (and thus didn't really 'work'), but it fit a lot better than the Japanese VA (who I don't care for at all)."
Haruhi,37snkw,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:10:57 2015 UTC,"I do think it is just the voice actress trying a different Yuki Nagato since it is a different Nagato.  Also, the sound design seemed decently bizarre to me at first, but I think I got used to it.  I don't know why, but the sound design just feels different.  Either way, when are we going to get season 3?  ;)"

Haruhi,37kl10,aceROB,2,Thu May 28 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was weird the opening title supports the ""Haruhi got her powers from aliens"" theory, rather than making a title sequence which is neutral on the issue and allowing the viewers to make up their own minds."
Haruhi,37kl10,TheSilverFin,2,Thu May 28 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"She got her powers from the gods, obviously. It's pretty obvious that she 'gets' her powers in the incident from three years to go. They pretty much stress that point throughout the series.  It's like a clusterfuck singularity of sci-fi."
Haruhi,37owtt,LordDurand,3,Fri May 29 06:27:23 2015 UTC,"It's possible they would be visible, but not that much or in that way. The image more accurately conveys what something flush with the inside of her thigh would look like. That is to say, the artist seemingly recolored a part of her leg, and it's throwing you off, because the area the artist wanted to show is between the legs, not attached to one."
Haruhi,37owtt,FomorianKing,8,Fri May 29 07:56:26 2015 UTC,"How the in the hell does THIS make the front page? Creepy fan art assessments? Seriously, is this some kind of joke that I'm just not getting?"

Haruhi,37owtt,bigbaddickwolf,2,Fri May 29 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"Moderator here.  Yes, the sub isn't thriving too much, but dear god it's better than what it used to be. Compared to some of the things that used to be posted here (for those who've been here well over a year), this isn't too bad. Not trying to say content like this should be posted here all the time, but it legitimately could be worse.   Plus, it did get downvoted so the majority of people here do agree with you."
Haruhi,37owtt,fatblackninja,2,Fri May 29 20:45:55 2015 UTC,"But allowing these sorts of posts just starts down that path again. :(  ""too bad"" is still bad nonetheless."
Haruhi,37owtt,DevoutHaruhiist,0,Sat May 30 04:18:10 2015 UTC,"This is a shit post, clear as mud.   Pretty much this. Sad day for this sub since things tend to be more lighthearted and fun or at least more engaging, but this... ugh.  It feels like a 12 year for 4chan sneaked on in here. :P"
Haruhi,37owtt,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Fri May 29 18:01:19 2015 UTC,what the hell is even going on here? this is just dumb or the creepiest troll ive seen.
Haruhi,37owtt,FerraTorr,1 point,Fri May 29 16:53:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah this needs a NSFW tag... this stuff may fly on deviant art or in Japan.. but Christ I browse reddit at work and all I need is this crap on my screen.  And more creepy than a borderline lolita pic is why the frack are you staring at it for hours?  Mods, pretty please.. err on the side of caution."
Haruhi,37owtt,FatBabyBrother,-1,Sat May 30 01:52:40 2015 UTC,I thought the word 'pantsu' in the title was more than enough for something that's borderline NSFW. I was staring at it for hours because Haruhi is beautiful and I was also trying to figure out if her panties being drawn in the picture made any sense.
Haruhi,37owtt,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Sat May 30 02:23:42 2015 UTC,Hows about you tag remotely NSFW as NSFW... that way everyone else can decide if its safe or not.  Would hate to bail on this sub but I can't risk things like this on a work PC. Just cause I am curious... how many hours did you stare at the drawing?  We talking double digits?
Haruhi,37owtt,LeBraveryLe,-1,Sat May 30 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I wouldn't even consider this remotely NSFW since it's just a little white oval on the side of her leg that isn't even the centerpoint of the picture.  I'd say I stared at this for about two hours if you include the time spent looking at the picture, time spent trying to figure out if the panies placement makes sense, and the time spent photoshopping the panties out when the one person who was helpful in this thread informed me that it really doesn't make any sense.  However, I stare at my large repository of Haruhi pictures on a daily basis for much longer than a mere two hours."
Haruhi,37owtt,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Sat May 30 03:07:25 2015 UTC,Fucking disgusting weeaboo.
Haruhi,37owtt,LeBraveryLe,1 point,Sat May 30 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"To each his own but if you can't see how this would cause a trip to HR then I'm gonna guess that you are not an adult in the most general sense of the word. Let me put it to you this way... if this were a photo of your daughter, would you be OK with people seeing this?  That's pretty much a guideline that you can live by."
Haruhi,37kq6v,harsh183,5,Thu May 28 09:59:37 2015 UTC,"My favorite theory is that Mikuru is so repeatedly against 'getting close' to Kyon not because of Haruhi's jealousy, but because she's really a time traveling version of Kyon's sister. Lampshaded by Kyon's sister never getting along with strangers (except Mikuru), and Haruhi telling Kyon's sister ""eat your vegetables if you want to grow up big like Mikuru"""
Haruhi,37kq6v,whut-whut,2,Fri May 29 04:48:17 2015 UTC,"Good theory.  I just remembered the LN chapter where LN spoilers, so the time difference between Mikuru's world and Kyon's isn't that large."
Haruhi,37kq6v,MetalPandaDance,1 point,Fri May 29 05:39:54 2015 UTC,LN spoilers
Haruhi,37kq6v,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yea that might be true, it's been a while since I've read the LN."
Haruhi,37kq6v,MetalPandaDance,5,Tue Jun 2 04:07:29 2015 UTC,"I don't buy the official story on the endless eight. The 2 things that don't make sense to me: Nagato's line of ""it is my job to observe"" and the fact that homework saves the day.. I think those 2 things are intimately related."
Haruhi,37kq6v,SatoshiKuro,6,Thu May 28 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think why endless eight happened was because Haruhi wanted to do something with Kyon. If you notice through out the arc Kyon never really interacted with Haruhi all that much, however going to Kyon's house to do homework gave her that oportunity and thus summer was complete for her and the days continued as normal."
Haruhi,37kq6v,SpaceOri,5,Thu May 28 19:45:26 2015 UTC,"Kyon never really interacted with Haruhi all that much   Yep, he pays way more attention to Nagato, more in that one day than any throughout the entire series"
Haruhi,37kq6v,fatblackninja,3,Thu May 28 20:27:06 2015 UTC,What's gonna happen when Haruhi dies?
Haruhi,37kq6v,SpaceOri,4,Thu May 28 18:23:35 2015 UTC,">implying she CAN die  In all seriousness, it's somewhat thought provoking. What really WOULD happen if the ""God"" (well, except for those who think Kyon's actually God) were to die. Would the world cease to exist? Would she ""reincarnate"" and the whole cycle repeats for eternity? Or would she gradually lose her power as she ages and someone else gains it, either by her choosing or random choosing?   Damn, the more I think about it the more creepy it gets"
Haruhi,37kq6v,Bioman2222,1 point,Thu May 28 22:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, wasn't that the threat in Surprise? That although she has godlike powers, she can somehow dies or get killed, and transfer the powers to someone else not by her will. That was what Fujiwara thought and somehow got really close to do it"
Haruhi,37kq6v,Kafke,2,Fri May 29 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"Something's going to happen where the Agency's going to suddenly become in favor of doing something to Haruhi. I say this as Koizumi seems to foreshadow in saying he would rather side with the SOS Brigade than the Agency, making a sort of Chekhov's Gun, and I feel like this will happen in an installment with a similar style to The Disappearance, and will contain some major character development for Koizumi."
Haruhi,37kq6v,Kafke,1 point,Sun May 31 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't finished reading all the novels yet, but I'm a believer of the whole Kyon is a slider thing. I think Tsuruya is as well. Things just seem to point to that conclusion."
Haruhi,37kq6v,dayum-son,2,Fri May 29 12:04:12 2015 UTC,but Yuki said that he was normal.
Haruhi,37kq6v,Kafke,3,Fri May 29 12:32:42 2015 UTC,"Yuki also said to not blindly believe her. On top of that, there's a weird constant reassurance that Kyon is a ""completely normal human being"".  Yet, he's the only character to remember the alternate history, enter closed space with haruhi, have constant contact and helping time travelers, etc."
Haruhi,37kq6v,UndeadNightmare937,2,Fri May 29 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"I mean, shit, he hasn't actually used any kind of ""slider"" powers himself but he's already been bounced around multiple different dimensions so he's kind of an ""indirect slider"" in a weird sorta way."
Haruhi,37kq6v,Kafke,3,Fri May 29 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't think he intentionally can control his sliding. But I do think he is a slider.  In a sort of ""what sort of situation Kyon wants, he ""slides"" to"" sort of way.  A good example is the movie. He works on it pretty damn hard, and falls asleep. Then just ""magically"" he happens to awaken to the movie finished, and Haruhi congratulating him.  I took that to be not Haruhi's powers kicking in, but Kyon sliding to an alternate timeline where he did finish the movie.  As I said, there's lots of little things throughout the series that reaffirm this thought. Things like Kyon being the center of all the time travel stuff (Rather than just being involved). He's the one that needs to decide to go back and do the disappearance stuff. He's the only one who ever remembers the alternate pasts and such, and is the only one to go into the closed space, alternate timelines, etc.  Either Kyon is a slider, or he has a direct influence on the events in the timeline that take place (being able to have it go perfectly as he expects). Simply because it can't be any of the characters we already know about, and Kyon's the only one left."
Haruhi,37kq6v,DarkStar5758,1 point,Sat May 30 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting way to look at it, but it's not like Intrigues spoilers   You could also make the argument that Kyon is the one involved with the time travel because he's the main character, and there wouldn't be an interesting story otherwise. This could be considered too general, though."
Haruhi,37imfl,1tobedoneX,5,Wed May 27 22:18:10 2015 UTC,For some reason I get the feeling Haruhi and Mikuru wouldn't be the best at stealth.
Haruhi,37imfl,DarkStar5758,3,Wed May 27 22:28:46 2015 UTC,ninja nagato would render the other two completely redundant

Haruhi,36xbyd,appropriate-username,8,Fri May 22 22:04:43 2015 UTC,"Okay, watched this week's episode and... it was at least 75% filler. Ignoring pure filler episodes, this has got to be the most filleriest thing I've seen since I dropped the One Piece anime. Some of the filler was admittedly fun, like the ping pong tournament and karaoke, but still, insane amounts of filler. Also made more comments on my blog per usual, and it was nice to see Arakawa and the Tamaru brothers again too? Oh, and TSURUYA MART at the start. That wasn't in the manga either, but it was great."
Haruhi,36xbyd,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Sat May 23 00:27:59 2015 UTC,"So, just for fun I decided to try cutting out all the filler I could to see how much of an episode we'd have left. Once I'd cut it all out, with the OP, ED and next episode preview included it was 6:54 long. Without the OP, ED and preview it was only 3:29."
Haruhi,36xbyd,SaiyamanMS,3,Sat May 23 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a fellow manga reader, it was infested with filler.  I was honestly expecting to be at the end of the volume by now.  I guess they wanted it to wait.  Hopefully next episode has it."

Haruhi,36xbyd,Kafke,3,Mon May 25 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"When Kyon got back into the bath and said that he wanted to get his money's worth, I feel like that was the writer's way of telling the audience that they intended to squeeze every ounce of fan-service they could from their only onsen episode."
Haruhi,36xbyd,heropon_riki,3,Sat May 23 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"Since I missed typing up a comment for last episode, I'll cover both here (since it's roughly the same arc/plot anyway). Despite the fact that it doesn't progress the main story at all, and a lot of people don't like these episodes, I'm actually sort of grateful for these slow 'nothing happens' episodes. One of the main things that attracted me to the main series was simply seeing the characters antics from day to day. And I feel these last two episodes did that perfectly.  The fan service in this last episode was a bit too much, IMO. I was hoping for more ""Kyon singing"" and less ""look at the haruhi characters without clothes but with things conveniently blocking the view!""  The Tsuruya references were flooding this episode. Everything from Tsuruya mart, to the Crane statues (that Yuki was eyeing for a good 5 minutes), etc. Fantastic. Lots of Tsuruya screen time too.  And lastly, I'd like to mention the little background bits that are always in Haruhi episodes, but never in the spotlight. Stuff like Koizumi bringing his board game to the bath, Koizumi/Tsuruya/Mikuru being the only ones clapping at Haruhi's ping pong tournament announcement, the ping pong tournament's number being the same as the number of E8 cycles the characters went through, etc.  I think it's also worth noting that my face blindness was out in full force this episode. I didn't even realize the Tamaru brothers were in the episode, I wasn't sure if Arakawa/Mori were actually themselves, or if I was getting them mixed up with nameless characters, and if the main characters didn't have unique hair colors, I'd have probably mixed them up too (one scene Haruhi doesn't have her hairband on, and she doesn't look like haruhi at all, lawl)."
Haruhi,36xbyd,Kafke,3,Mon May 25 10:49:40 2015 UTC,"I guess I am in the minority... I like these episodes.. this ep. has to have been the most Japanese thing I've seen in a while.  I mean when I go on vacation wanting to take a bath with everyone really isn't on my to do list (yeah, I know, Japanese culture).... I guess that's why I like these episodes so much.  I think the progression of Yuki and Kyon's bond is still growing and several times Kyon was shown to have been thinking about Yuki, and that he missed her.  Yuki really did something unexpected and opened the matchmaking temple door, not once, but twice (and showed some boob.. yo go girl). WTF is up with Koizume?  Hitting on Kyon TWICE?  But I will give mad props for getting nekkid in the karoke lounge.  Hell I would have done that if Haruhi was there.  I really don't go for fan service... so that kinda annoyed me."
Haruhi,36xbyd,FatBabyBrother,2,Mon May 25 18:12:25 2015 UTC,"This episode rubbed me the wrong way. I've been watching this series just to watch it, not disliking it, but also not really liking it either.  With the exception of the Karaoke part with Kyon this episode did absolutely nothing for me, I actually dropped it half way through and heard spoilers which kept me watching (People who know it probably know which one I'm talking about).  Series is on thin ice right now unfortunately. Sucks, cause the movie was great."
Haruhi,36xbyd,ThatGuyfromNI,1 point,Sat May 23 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"It is a 6.75 on MyAnimeList.  To be honest, while it isn't great, it isn't necessarily bad either.  I think one of the problems is that people, surprisingly, came to the anime expecting stuff to actually be like the original series.  A similar reason why I feel like the Haruhi movie went down on MyAnimeList (people thought it was a standalone).  Also, this episode was mainly filler.  I think everything will be higher when it happens."
Haruhi,36xbyd,Zinx10,2,Sat May 23 17:14:37 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess an episode like this was inevitable. And I see the continuation of references is still strong. That Endless Eight one was used twice.   Also, I wasn't expecting for Kyon x Koizumi fans to get their moments."

Haruhi,36h0rs,EXbob702,19,Tue May 19 09:30:17 2015 UTC,"This new world, is not real. This is a false reality. Staying in the new reality would be like running away from reality, and leaving his friends fro dead... the new Brigade isn't the old one, they might have the same body and personality, but they aren't his friends, they are other people. Not going back to his reality, not only is running away from difficulties, it's letting his friends die for ever.  Think of it like the Matrix. Sure, inside the Matrix everything is better, but would you prefer to live a peaceful lie, than reality?"
Haruhi,36h0rs,Rein3,8,Tue May 19 09:41:36 2015 UTC,"It's just as real as the last one, even in season 1 Koizumi says their reality could have been made just a week ago or something similar. The world was changed, it's not fake. If he had chosen to stay things would have continued as normal from what we're told. The comparison to the matrix doesn't really work because the world itself was changed, it was no simulation it was real, physical. And honestly he had the choice between a world that didn't have any supernatural elements, or a world that could be destroyed for a teenage girl with a mere thought. And again it's not so much his choice to change things back that bothers me the most, it's that he treated the new versions of his friends as though he didn't care. He didn't give them a say in the matter at all."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Rein3,10,Tue May 19 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"He doesn't belong in the new world, for him, the new one is fake. It's not HIS world. It looks like, it feels like but it's not.  For Kyon, the new world, is a Matrix, a perfect world were he can live with his normal friends, without worrying of his reality. It's not real, not in the sense of physically real, but metaphysically.    it's that he treated the new versions of his friends as though he didn't care. He didn't give them a say in the matter at all.   You might have a point with this... but still, I see them as fakes, no real Haruhi and comp. They are lies made to make Kyon happy. They are not the real Brigade."
Haruhi,36h0rs,wolfavenger90,4,Tue May 19 10:04:33 2015 UTC,"It just feels so cold to me to call them fakes. Regardless of their origin they were sentient, the had lives, feelings, they were people just like anyone else. Imagine someone came into your life and said you were made two days ago and they were going to change things back meaning you no longer exist. Would the fact you only apparently came into existence a couple of days ago change how you feel about it? Would it make it any better from your perspective? Would you be okay with it? Hell Yuki and Mikuru didn't even know what was going on."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Rein3,9,Tue May 19 10:53:24 2015 UTC,"But that is the point, they were just strangers. Would you still feel this way if they were just a bunch of random people we had not seen before? I doubt you would. The problem as i see it is they are skinned and voiced the same so we want them to be the same.  Take for example the new show. They all look and sound the same but i would give them up in an instant to be back with the original crew."
Haruhi,36h0rs,wolfavenger90,2,Tue May 19 15:06:57 2015 UTC,Shit yeah I'd give them up in the new show but that's because they're annoying as fuck and aren't at all what they were like in the movie.
Haruhi,36h0rs,Ergoemos,5,Wed May 20 08:52:06 2015 UTC,"And what happens with the originals? They died? You'll let your friends die? Your best friends, the people you had your most important experiences with, the people who have defined you, the people who saved you.... let them die, for some random people that only look like your original friends?  The choice Kyon had was: escape his reality, and everything that mead that reality especial, even his friends. He has the chance to start over, from 0. To let everyone who he loves become empty vessels...   Run away , and let intrusmentality give him his perfect world?   (HOLLY SHIT HARUHIXEVANGELION)"
Haruhi,36h0rs,dayum-son,1 point,Tue May 19 15:42:52 2015 UTC,I've said this so many times now; it's not his choice that bothers me so much it's how he doesn't consult the new versions of his friends at all or even say goodbye. They have as much a right to exist as anyone else and they'd done nothing but help him.
Haruhi,36h0rs,hazelnutman,1 point,Wed May 20 08:53:52 2015 UTC,I think you are goving Kyon to much credit. I put myself in his shoes. I am in a reality where my friends have chaged to be somewhat normal. The look and talk the same but have different personallitys. I would change it back as quick as possible to get to MY friends and also not get attached to the new one. Also i feel no need to thank them since they are about to not exist.
Haruhi,36h0rs,wolfavenger90,14,Wed May 20 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"This is honestly a really smart and defendable stance.   If Kyon presses enter, he kills the new universe. ""Real"" or not, there are 7 billion people dead, wiped from existence.   On the other hand, if he doesn't press enter, then he will have effectively chosen to kill a different but nearly identical set of 7 billion people, wiped out Mikuru's future, and destroyed the vast intelligence of the Integrated Data Thought Entity.   Of course, he doesn't know that when he presses enter, it is more than just a matter of ""welp, crisis averted"". Kyon still has to go through a trial of shooting Yuki Nagato with the counter virus when she changes the world.  And then Kyon fails by getting stabbed. Gone another way, Kyon could have effectively killed both universes by creating a paradox and ending it all for selfish reasons.   Fortunately, Kyon lives in a self-correcting universe and deus ex Mikuru saves the universe  via another time traveling moment from Kyon himself.   But if he failed, and the universe had not self-corrected... everyone would be dead, most likely. Because Kyon wanted to live in a universe familiar.   Interesting thoughts all around though. I don't judge either side of the debate, but I love the speculation and thought provoking concept."
Haruhi,36h0rs,thephotoman,9,Tue May 19 14:37:43 2015 UTC,deus ex Mikuru   I love this
Haruhi,36h0rs,FatBabyBrother,3,Tue May 19 16:10:09 2015 UTC,I never classified for this information.
Haruhi,36h0rs,FatBabyBrother,3,Fri May 22 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting that choosing to keep the new world means permanently saying goodbye to the old one. Kyon had only two choices, and it was between 1) the ""dream SOS-Brigade"" that he scrapped together in a few minutes, and 2) the SOS-Brigade he grew to love over their countless adventures.  The choice he made was obvious, especially considering the time limit he had. Kyon rejecting SOS-Brigade #2 would have been far more heartless, especially considering the history he has with them. After all, the SOS-Brigade from his old world are his friends, and the alternative members before him in the new world are merely projections of what he believed at first to be a more ""preferable"" version of his friends. The scene where Kyon presses Enter without hesitation is powerful for this reason - it drives home the point that Kyon deliberately chooses to continue a life of getting dragged into world-threatening adventures while complaining about Haruhi, even when his initial wishes of a mundane life are before his eyes."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Protopulse,3,Tue May 19 10:09:36 2015 UTC,"I know that's what he wants and I can get that, it's the fact he doesn't even think they are worth talking to first, an explanation, or even a goodbye. Nowhere is it said that they are ""projections"", they are people. From their perspective they are normal people, and they are in every way. To remove them from existence without talking to them first feels so cold. Again it's not his decision it's how fast he made it, and the fact he didn't talk to any of them before making it."
Haruhi,36h0rs,FatBabyBrother,2,Tue May 19 10:59:15 2015 UTC,But why talk to them. Yes they think they have been there the whole time but it is from kyons perspective that this adventure happens. If we go by what you are saying should he not talk to every person in the world?
Haruhi,36h0rs,deathowm,1 point,Tue May 19 15:09:38 2015 UTC,"He wasn't friends with every person in the world. Every person in the world didn't help him figure out what was going on. Every person in the world didn't show him sympathy in his time of need. Why talk to them? Because they are the people he is with in the moment whom have helped him, he still shares a history with Haruhi, and Yuki obviously has strong feelings for him."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Taiboss,3,Wed May 20 08:58:31 2015 UTC,"After Disappearance, I was like, ""That bitch deserves Haruhi."""
Haruhi,36h0rs,Mullamanga,2,Tue May 19 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Now that is something I agree with. I loved Koizumi's line to Kyon about how Haruhi is interested in Koizumi, Yuki, and Mikuru because of their oddities yet she still keeps Kyon around implying she's interested in him, something more than a passing interest."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Luy22,2,Wed May 20 09:02:09 2015 UTC,"Kyon missed the antics.  His monologue points this out quite clearly.  He didn't want safe and boring, he wanted excitement and adventure.  If the new Haruhi/Nagato etc were like the old, but 'better' he would have stayed. And how could you explain that the universe as the new SoS Brigade new it was less than a day or two old?  Whats really odd, is that in the coffee house Koizumi readily grasps the concept of the 'new' or 'parallel' universe.. and even comes up with a way to fix the situation in under 3 minutes... with a diagram on a napkin.  I know its a plot point, but when did Koizumi become knowledgeable about temporal displacements in the new world???"
Haruhi,36h0rs,Luy22,1 point,Tue May 19 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"I found his conclusion believable the only thing that really bothered me there was how he said ""it seems you now have the keys mentioned in Yuki's message"" or something along those lines. I don't understand how or why he came to that particular conclusion. And yeah I know he missed it, I know he wanted to go back. It's how he never said anything about it to the new versions that felt cold."
Haruhi,36h0rs,Luy22,3,Wed May 20 09:00:19 2015 UTC,"The keys were the SoS brigade members.. for some reason in order to activate the PC and start the dialog on the monitor all the members had to be in the room.  But the 'make your choice' monologue happens AFTER he pressed the ENTER key (and starts all the time travelling to 'reprogram' Yuki before she remakes the world).  So Kyon has already given up on the new reality, quite honestly, from the beginning he never, ever gave it a chance.  He further gut kicks Yuki in the new world by giving her back the Literary Club membership paper... dick move Kyon, dick move."

Haruhi,36gw1n,Zinx10,1 point,Wed May 20 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"As a person who literally owns every single light novel, I can tell you that I believe the writing gets better.  However, though, the amount of obvious typos increase as time goes on.  For example, ""the Dissociation of Haruhi Suzumiya"" (book 9) has a typo where it says ""Haurhi"" rather than ""Haruhi.""  My only guess is that the translators changed over time, but that writing is definitely the best  later on (assuming you haven't finished them all).  One thing that may be throwing you off is that the later Haruhi books require more math and science rather than references (as made in ""the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya"" for example)."
Haruhi,36gw1n,Zinx10,1 point,Wed May 20 18:26:19 2015 UTC,I am studying A level maths. I am specifically referring to the most recent three books with the anti-SOS brigade. I own the kindle versions specifically in case that changes something.
Haruhi,36f1hl,EXbob702,8,Mon May 18 21:51:06 2015 UTC,"Eh, pretty low to non-existent.  As stated before, Aya Hirano was not one of the main reasons for the lack of S3.  Rather, it was (and still is) the lack of new material to promote.  It's been years since the last LN, with no real sign pointing to a new one.  So, despite Haruhi's popularity, Kadokawa doesn't really have a reason to make S3, even if there is enough source material to be adapted.  Sucks, but that's how it do."
Haruhi,36f1hl,KeegoTheWise,2,Mon May 18 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"It really is disappointing, I was hoping this spin off show would revitalize things but I get the feeling when it's done nothing will have changed. And besides wouldn't the show continuing attract more people to the original books? What do Kadokawa have to lose?"
Haruhi,36f1hl,xxninjatacoxx,1 point,Tue May 19 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"I suppose the people who enjoyed the anime would buy the LN to find out what happens next, if they adapt all the LN content then people would not need to read the manga as they know what happens. Kinda sucks, but that's the way it is."
Haruhi,36f1hl,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Tue May 19 15:01:59 2015 UTC,"I can't really speak to the viability of the continuation of the main anime, but if it were to come back, there's no reason to think it'd necessarily be KyoAni. There's a number of shows where subsequent seasons are done by a different studio. Just off the top of my head, there's Oreimo, OreGairu, Persona 4...  As for the animation style of Yuki-chan, it's quite deliberately drawn in a different style than the original series to more closely match the style of the manga. Much like KyoAni themselves did with Haruhi-chan (also by the same manga artist as Yuki-chan).  If Satellite were to do season 3 of the main series, you can probably expect the art style to have more resemblance to KyoAni's original series."
Haruhi,36f1hl,hobojoe0858,1 point,Tue May 19 11:42:48 2015 UTC,"Oreimo season 2 was produced by a different studio, but they kept the original staff that did season one."
Haruhi,36f1hl,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Thu May 21 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"If they can make a manga that sells enough then yes, a new series is a possibility.   Remember anime sells manga (you buy manga, anime is free). My concern is what would the plot look like?  I can only take so many years of Kyon's passive aggressiveness.  Maybe if Koizumi dies in every episode... that would be worth a watch."
Haruhi,36f1hl,Zinx10,2,Tue May 19 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"The manga is complete and is not the original material.  The original material are the light novels.  Also, I can definitely tell you what the plot would look like if the farthest you know about is merely the movie."

Haruhi,35vyly,Requiem45,7,Wed May 13 23:33:20 2015 UTC,Let's hope they get all of the original actors back
Haruhi,35vyly,DarkStar5758,4,Wed May 13 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"Even if they bring Michelle back, Yuki talks so completely opposite of every other series that it will sound weird no matter what."

Haruhi,35vyly,The_Nightmoose,3,Thu May 14 20:47:44 2015 UTC,Good.
Haruhi,35vyly,Vondi,2,Wed May 13 23:43:58 2015 UTC,Is it just me or is that unusually early? Though they always waited till they had more than just early pre-orders to go on in finding what they should dub.
Haruhi,35vyly,Kafke,5,Wed May 13 23:54:59 2015 UTC,"It's a broadcast dub, if you're not familiar with it they usually take over half of their simulcasts every season and start releasing dubbed episodes every week about half way - three quarters of the way through the season."
Haruhi,35vyly,JRPictures,1 point,Thu May 14 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"Am I reading that correctly? That while all of those are getting dubs, only the listed ones at the end (not including Yuki-chan) are being aired early?  I remember someone posting on how the dub would have to come later (rather than aired with the Japanese) if they were going to use the original cast. Is that accurate?  Hopefully it is. Would certainly suck to have a different dub cast."
Haruhi,35vyly,SaiyamanMS,2,Thu May 14 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"Am I reading that correctly? That while all of those are getting dubs, only the listed ones at the end (not including Yuki-chan) are being aired early?   All the ones listed in Phase 2 are dubs that are going to air soon, they just don't have a premiere date as of yet.   I remember someone posting on how the dub would have to come later (rather than aired with the Japanese) if they were going to use the original cast. Is that accurate?   Those were mostly just predictions from others due to the logistics of dubbing. The original Haruhi dub was recorded in Bang Zoom Studios in L.A. whereas Funimation and its in-house dubbing studio are located in Texas. Having to outsource a dub to another state and do it week to week would be ridiculously hard work, which is why most thought Funimation would outsource the dub (or fly the original actors to their studio) after the entire show was complete.   As for whether or not they're getting the original cast back we'll have to wait and see, but I wouldn't hold my breath."
Haruhi,35vyly,FatBabyBrother,1 point,Thu May 14 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"I know that Stephanie, Johnny and Michelle have worked with Funi before, not sure on any of the others.  I think most of Stephanie's work for Funi in Texas has mostly been fairly minor roles(?), so I'm not sure if they could get her there long enough to be a major character in a weekly show. If they were dubbing the whole thing at once after it's over I might consider it a different story.  Michelle worked with them on Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine in the title role of Fujiko, reprising her role from the Lupin III TV series which was dubbed by Geneon in LA. Not sure what other work she's done with them? Probably not likely to see her back, especially for a series being released weekly.  Johnny, we may actually have a real chance for seeing as he had a recurring role as the character Johnny in Space Dandy, which also had a simuldub.  As for Crispin, Wendee, Bridget and Kari, I think that it's reasonably likely they may not be back at all."
Haruhi,35vyly,Kafke,1 point,Thu May 14 12:17:32 2015 UTC,I don't think the original cast would be as good as people hope.  The spin off really is a different universe and to further confuse the two would be confusing-er.  The art style is also off just a little... Kyon looks like he is 2-3 years younger in the Nagato series (and his head is really small compared to his body.. its freaking me out).
Haruhi,35vyly,FatBabyBrother,3,Thu May 14 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"If the original cast is good enough for the Japanese audio, it's good enough for the english audio, IMO. I mean, they literally kept the comparison to Lucky Star as well, so it'd be a bit surprising if they didn't do it here."

Haruhi,35pm3p,Rowanana,2,Tue May 12 15:11:08 2015 UTC,I printed it out actually. I only was able to print one thing before I graduate so this is the only one I have but I might be able to make some next year depending on my uni's rules for the 3D printers (read: if I can find the computer that they print from and log in). I can also upload the STL file later for others to use (or improve on) but mediafire is blocked here so I have to wait until I get home.
Haruhi,35pm3p,Rowanana,1 point,Tue May 12 15:24:28 2015 UTC,I would love to have that STL! You could upload it to Thingiverse too if you wanted to make it widely available.
Haruhi,35pm3p,Hawkki,2,Tue May 12 15:52:48 2015 UTC,"I wasn't able to get it up today due to finals and work, so I should have it up by 9am CST tomorrow. I also thought of something that I'll have to do a bit of research on that might delay it a little, but probably not.  It will be on Thingiverse though. I got no matches when I searched for Haruhi and a bunch of what look like school projects when I searched SOS, so I am fixing that."

Haruhi,35ezbb,zaturama008,2,Sun May 10 01:20:24 2015 UTC,"This season contains arcs that occurred chronologically in the first season and more.   Depends on how you want to watch  them. Assuming the link you posted means that the order is the 2009 broadcast (also known as Season 2 broadcast), the that's chronological order.  ""Broadcast order"" refers to when the first season (1-14) aired earlier, and is all out of order. With this order, Season 2 didn't exist, so there's no legitimate placing for them, which people then end up sticking them onto to the end (so it'd be 1-14 out of order, and then 15-28 in order).  If you simply downloaded them all from somewhere, check the first episode. If it starts off with a rant about Santa, you've got the chronological order.  If it starts off like an old anime that's a piece of crap, you've got the broadcast order.  Complete downloads/listings I can't imagine would have any other order.  And for a final check, if you have the episode names, you can cross reference it here.  Now... which order to watch it in? I personally recommend chronological (starting with the santa rant). Since that's the way the books were released as well (well, the books are slightly out of order, but not like the original broadcast).  But some people prefer the original broadcast due to it's 'uniqueness'.  I'd say, if your order is the one in the link, then just do that. That should be (provided nothing was shifted around) the chronological order, and introduce things like a typical anime, rather than jump around and expect you to know things and then introduce them later."

Haruhi,35cuwd,1tobedoneX,3,Sat May 9 02:12:01 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know (like I do, and I'll explain the best I can),  - apparently - the Abridging of Haruhi Suzumiya was an abridging of the show, which seemed to be very good, considering that I found forum posts and lists rating it very high. It was made back around 2009 - 2010 (I don't really know), but now: it's gone, and I can't find any back ups, so it's lost. Really unfortunate, since I would really have wanted to watch it...  Well, at least I have Haroohee to distract me."
Haruhi,35cuwd,Kumoriel,1 point,Sat May 9 02:14:10 2015 UTC,I watched it a while back. It was indeed pretty good and the voice over quality was good too (unlike many abridged series out there). YouTyrant is all about that copyright take down these days...
Haruhi,35cuwd,Kumoriel,2,Sat May 9 14:55:39 2015 UTC,Do you know about any reuploads and back-ups?
Haruhi,35c8jc,SaiyamanMS,6,Fri May 8 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this week's episode. It covered exactly what I expected it to and I didn't have a whole lot to say about it. I totally expected them to remove Asakura breaking the fourth wall by blatantly referencing the original series, which they did. Overall, a reasonably fun episode."
Haruhi,35c8jc,DarkStar5758,5,Sat May 9 01:05:01 2015 UTC,Why does Kyon call Ryouko Nakazawa? What does she have to do with sushi?
Haruhi,35c8jc,Captain_Gardar,0,Sat May 9 01:27:49 2015 UTC,"You know, I personally don't like sushi at all. In fact, I could say I hate it.  All started when I was in 6th grade, long time ago. A friend of mine offered me a piece. I thought to myself, ""you know, I've never tried it. My sister likes it, a lot of my friends like it, why not.""   So I grabbed a piece. Shoved it in my mouth, swallowed, and said:   Tastes kinda wei--bluehueueuhguehguhg   So yeah. No more sushi.  I know this is totally irrelevant, but I felt like sharing that story. I feel better. Thank you for listening."
Haruhi,35c8jc,Kafke,3,Sun May 10 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"As an other commenter said, this episode really felt like just a filler. But I'm looking forward the next one, Haruhi is back in action with the return of the title cone!"
Haruhi,35c8jc,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat May 9 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"It's unanimous, this week was a filler.   Was still fun though. Just...nothing really to add to the story haha"
Haruhi,35c8jc,Luy22,4,Sun May 10 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"Kind of late, since I've been a bit wrapped up in things these last couple of days (lots of Splatoon Hype :P).  Asakura is really growing on me. In the main series she was kind of just a toss-away side character like many others we see. However, I feel like this anime is taking the bits and pieces we already knew about her and expanding them into a full character.  Seems to be working out well. She's quickly become one of my favorites. And I really felt she was the star of this episode.  Kyon... I dunno where to begin. Perhaps this is just me missing Crispin Freeman, but Kyon just never feels quite right in the scenes he's in. The dumb thing was a bit overplayed, I think. Despite it making for comedy gold. IIRC, Kyon was able to follow along the more complicated stuff in the main series, even if Koizumi had to give him a nudge. Here, he's just kind of a dunce.   Mikuru... keeps taking one step forward and two steps back. She's pretty much been delegated to ""boob missile"" in this episode. Which was hilarious. But I think like 95% of her screen time was literally just laying on the ground.   HOLY HNNG ASAKURA   Yea, I'm not sure what was happening to my brain when that image popped up. All sorts of confusion, interest, etc.   That math is...lol fuck that man. No thanks.   You mean you don't know how to garblegarble and bouncysquish numbers? :P Coulda sworn Nagato was going to be played as a dumb character.   And, towards the end, queue kinda bad romcom stuff.   Say what you will, but I'm a sucker for that kinda stuff.  And now for what I consider the best part of any episode; the Tsuruya factor. This episode gets a Naga-mon/10. After last week's in/out appearance, our fabulous heroine has finally learned how to make an outstanding appearance. Boob missile mikuru out of nowhere, followed by a whole dialogue sequence of compliments to her entrance. Fantastic. She then follows up in the very next scene with a backstory for her whole motive in the series (and why she's so damned determined to hook up Kyon/Mikuru). A whole array of excellent stills, and emotion. And it's fun to see Tsuruya take on different roles other than ""genki ninja throwing people around"". Like her seriousness with Yuki, and... this... I'd also like to use this moment to point out how much I love this face that she seems to make every so often. It's like a ""I'm not sure what I should do now that I've made my entrance"" face. So much Tsuruya being packed into these episodes. It's making me a happy camper.  Finally, some side note stuff: It's nice to see Mori again, even if it's just for a few fleeting seconds. I seriously think she needs more screen time. I could see a Tsuruya/Mori/Asakura/Haruhi cast being amazing. I also finally got to see the OP with lyrics. I usually don't comment on this type of thing, but I'm used to having sub groups put them every other episode or so. Nothing real special about the lyrics, but they are alright. Seems to fit the visuals fine."
Haruhi,35c8jc,Luy22,3,Sun May 10 12:42:40 2015 UTC,"The comedy had its moments this episode, at least. That English joke from Kyon was pretty funny."
Haruhi,35c8jc,Thehoennhippo,3,Sat May 9 20:08:04 2015 UTC,"I liked it. Will Haruhi ever put on a North High uniform? I mean it's not even a North High uniform, it's HER uniform.  She is practically naked without her sailor stuff."
Haruhi,35c8jc,Thehoennhippo,0,Sun May 10 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"practically naked   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Someone had to do it, and I'm sorry to say that I am that guy."

I for one kinda enjoy the jacket/black thing she got going on"
Haruhi,35c8jc,CheetoFactor,2,Sun May 10 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, the plot/romance should start up again next episode, and then in a couple of episodes, the bet volume IMO will start (volume 4)."
Haruhi,35c8jc,FatBabyBrother,2,Sat May 9 14:01:35 2015 UTC,"A much more important question would be:  Why am I starting to like Asakura more and more? Regardless of the smoking dress she was wearing, I've come to realize besides that horrendous obsession over Nagato she's a great person.   An even MORE important question would be: question"

Haruhi,34rp3r,jereddit,0,Mon May 4 02:38:34 2015 UTC,Is it a good or bad thing that I had already seen most of them before I saw that album?  You'd think that that bunny suit Haruhi would be the most prevalent.

Haruhi,34qzbr,Rawr_im_a_Unicorn,1 point,Sun May 3 21:06:01 2015 UTC,It's on YouTube. I've watched it there a few times.
Haruhi,34qzbr,SwanX17,2,Sun May 3 21:10:48 2015 UTC,"When I went to check for the episodes on YouTube, a lot of them had been taken down."
Haruhi,34qzbr,DarkStar5758,1 point,Sun May 3 21:11:39 2015 UTC,I watched some literally yesterday and they were fine.  I just typed Tmohs episode one dub and there was a playlist with the whole first season second down.
Haruhi,34qzbr,Heinz_marble,2,Sun May 3 23:57:47 2015 UTC,I couldn't find any episode past the cultural festival arc.
Haruhi,34qzbr,SaiyamanMS,2,Mon May 4 00:12:39 2015 UTC,"But I was looking for both of the seasons with no episodes missing at all. I found a place to watch them, so it's fine."
Haruhi,34qzbr,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Mon May 4 00:15:01 2015 UTC,"Funimation went crazy a couple months ago and took down a lot of anime, but not in the USA. They only blocked it to contries outside the US like Canada and parts of Europe."
Haruhi,34qzbr,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Mon May 4 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"... Y'know, I think the only legal way to watch Haruhi at the moment is on DVD (or Blu-Ray), which are out of print in the US. The Australian DVDs and the Japanese Blu-Rays are in print and both have the English dub. (Japanese Blu-Rays are crazy expensive though. But also super gorgeous.) UK DVDs would have the English dub too, but I have no idea if those are in print or not.  As mentioned in other replies, there are... not quite so legal methods of watching the show too, which require significantly less money and/or effort as what I've outlined."
Haruhi,34qzbr,trambe25,1 point,Mon May 4 12:57:22 2015 UTC,The Blu-Rays are well worth it. ;)
Haruhi,34qzbr,DarkStar5758,2,Tue May 5 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"There are very few shows where I'd spend that much money on 28 episodes (especially when I already own it on DVD), but Haruhi is one of them. I've got the Japanese Blu-Rays for the TV series and Haruhi-chan and the Australian Blu-Ray for Disappearance."
Haruhi,34qzbr,trambe25,1 point,Tue May 5 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"Honnestly, the only place I can think of is kissanime.  It's illegal but hey, if you really want to see it go ahead"
Haruhi,34qzbr,Kafke,2,Sun May 3 20:45:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, Kissanime is illegal?"
Haruhi,34qzbr,trambe25,1 point,Mon May 4 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well as I heard, kissanime gives 0 revenu for the creators, it's better to use stuff like crunchyroll and etc  So kinda illegal I guess?"
Haruhi,34qzbr,Kafke,0,Mon May 4 02:02:30 2015 UTC,"Not kinda, definitely. Random anime streaming sites like Kissanime just grab random fansubs (which are also illegal) and upload them to their own host.  Edit: If you aren't watching Haruhi from Funimation, your DVDs, Crunchyroll, or Netflix, it's probably illegal."

Haruhi,34mhot,errantsignal,10,Sat May 2 14:23:45 2015 UTC,Courtesy chocolate is still chocolate ¯\ (ツ) /¯
Haruhi,34mhot,Ra5han,7,Sat May 2 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Even if Haruhi says it was a courtesy chocolate, we all know she actually means for it to be something more meaningful. She only called it a courtesy chocolate after she learned about Yuki's affection for Kyon. It's pretty much written all over Haruhi's face that she likes Kyon at a lot of points.  As much as I sympathize with Yuki, I'm still rooting for Haruhi in the end."
Haruhi,34mhot,GrayStandard,2,Sat May 2 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"Which is why as soon as I took this picture, I ate it!"
Haruhi,34mhot,1tobedoneX,8,Sat May 2 14:45:21 2015 UTC,Fun fact: Showa and Meiji are both (posthumous) names of Emperors.
Haruhi,34mhot,Donk72,6,Sat May 2 14:35:55 2015 UTC,"In fact, Meiji is the posthumous name of Emperor Mutsuhito - famous for bringing the Meiji Restoration to Japan, bringing the end to the Tokugawa Shogunate, and created the Empire of Japan.  Showa is the posthumous name of Emperor Hirohito - famous for being the Japanese emperor when Japan started the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, which escalated into being the Pacific theater in World War 2 after 1941; as well as being famous for being the post-war emperor who was the symbol of the new State of Japan, and was the symbol of the post-war economic miracle in Japan. He died when Japan had emerged as the second largest economy in the world. (Japan has since fallen to the 4th largest economy, but it's still very powerful.) He's also very controversial in Japan, China, and Korea, due to whenever or not he's responsible for some of the stuff done by the Japanese during World War 2. China and Korea hate him due to occupation, massacres, and the war, while it is more controversial in Japan, due to people liking the Emperor. In fact, Hitoshi Motoshima - the former mayor of Nagasaki - got a lot of controversy over his comments about the Emperor's responsibility in the war. It was so controversial, that someone even tried to assassinate him in 1990, but failed.  As you can tell, I am a massive history nerd."
Haruhi,34mhot,Kafke,3,Sat May 2 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I came here from /r/AskHistorians, thinking I was going to spend a few minutes with Haruhi. Instead I learned more interesting history here by digging deeper in Wikipedia.  Keep nerding!"
Haruhi,34mhot,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sat May 2 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"As someone who's not a history nerd at all, does the Haruhi series scratch your history nerd itch? I find that lots of parts introduce math, philosophy, and other interesting stuff. But I never really thought about whether it referenced actual historical stuff as well. Thinking about it now, it probably does. But I wouldn't know, since I'm clueless about history."
Haruhi,34mhot,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat May 2 22:26:58 2015 UTC,"From what I know, it's mostly just little tongue-in-cheek references to (mostly) Japanese history, which really isn't my forte."
Haruhi,34ooyo,FatBabyBrother,3,Sun May 3 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps searching for Haruhi (not Hurahi) would yield better results. I searched for "" haruhi bunnygirl"" and found tons of image results."
Haruhi,34ooyo,otakuman,3,Sun May 3 03:18:11 2015 UTC,You should look in /r/AnimeVectorWallpapers and search through the albumes.
Haruhi,34ooyo,SpaceOri,1 point,Sun May 3 07:59:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the two leads but I guess I should explain... I'm want to print out a vinyl decal and put it on my guitar (God Knows is pretty much my only reason for even learning the guitar) so the image needs to be kinda specific... so I wanted something from the episode where she sings 'God Knows' in her bunny suit.  Most of the images (and I've looked at so many images) aren't really suitable.. I like the close up/full face Haruhi images but her head is usually cropped off at the top and while fan are is good, I can tell the difference.    I'm really don't have much of a connection with Yuki or the others so I would really prefer just Hurahi alone...   The search continues...."
Haruhi,34ooyo,SpaceOri,1 point,Sun May 3 11:02:05 2015 UTC,"Take a screenshot of the moment in the episode you want, and ask someone in the subreddit if they can vector it or if someone has something similar to it."

Haruhi,34l92k,leopold_s,2,Sat May 2 10:32:47 2015 UTC,"... Tough question. I want to say Hare Hare Yukai, but there's almost a decade worth of nostalgia behind that one which puts Fure Fure Mirai at a disadvantage...  Kyon's version of Hare Hare Yukai is just pure genius though."
Haruhi,34jr6p,Fairchild972,12,Fri May 1 19:16:40 2015 UTC,How I see this show ending. Kyons going to break Nagato's heart and choose Haruhi leading to Asakura stabbing Kyon for hurting Nagato.
Haruhi,34jr6p,Fairchild972,2,Fri May 1 21:43:17 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to assume something similar may happen. This has been too happy happy rabu for me.   Rather, I kinda want something like that to happen. Would make the show flip upside down and shit itself. Can't imagine how that would go, but I'm kinda looking forward to seeing if any twists or hidden plots may come."
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,2,Fri May 1 21:59:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean the shows gotta be titled disappearance for a reason and we know how happy go lucky the last thing with disappearance in its name was.
Haruhi,34jr6p,DarkStar5758,2,Fri May 1 22:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the only reason ""Disappearance"" is in the title is because it's based on the Disappearance of Haruhi. Although I suppose you could make an argument for it referring to volume 4's story arc"

Haruhi,34jr6p,YellowChica,3,Sat May 2 03:20:33 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to appreciate this show more and more. To see how all these characters would act if they were real friends is just awesome.   Besides the art style not being as 'epic' as in the Disappearance movie, this art style makes it much more light hearted and funny. Especially the faces they sometimes make, they're just perfect."
Haruhi,34jr6p,Kafke,3,Fri May 1 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Damn it, Koizumi. When Haruhi gives you chocolate, you're not supposed to eat it. You're supposed to hold on to it and cherish it forever. This is Haruhi we are talking about here. Why wouldn't you hold onto things she gives you?"
Haruhi,34jr6p,Kafke,7,Sat May 2 04:33:17 2015 UTC,Because it's chocolate and chocolate is for nom noms.
Haruhi,34jr6p,Baconman17,1 point,Sat May 2 09:31:52 2015 UTC,So you want her love for him to ROT instead to BECOMING A PART OF HIM?
Haruhi,34jr6p,otakuman,3,Mon May 4 09:45:18 2015 UTC,"Man, even though I can understand why they decided to adapt this spin-off of haruhi as an anime, I would have so much preferred that they continued  the original series story instead (what happens with them after the plot of the movie, when Kyon returns to the original Universe).   This is because I really miss the charm season 1 had with Haruhi/Kyon as main characters and the craziness of Haruhi being a ""God"", which made it stand out as my favorit comical anime. Personally this is why this adaptation, in my opinion, is not that interesting to watch... -_-"
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Sun May 3 13:36:40 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna take a wild bet (not knowing how copyright law in Japan works) and say that KyoAni owns some sort of rights to the main-series anime. Meaning that making a S3 is off the table unless they agree. Or perhaps it's just due to a consistent style thing.  Either way, Yuki-chan is being produced by a separate animation studio, and is written by a different writer. So there's really no blockage in producing content.  As far as interest goes, I personally like the spin-off. Lets us get a lot more screen time with the characters, even if it's not covering regular Haruhi stuff."
Haruhi,34jr6p,UndeadNightmare937,4,Sun May 3 17:11:56 2015 UTC,"Take it. Don't take it. Where's Nagato? Take it. Don't Take it. Eat it. Don't Eat it. FFS. It was about time someone shook things up.  Seriously though, the over exaggeration of shyness/anxiety is almost sickening. And that's coming from someone who has those problems. Though at times it's painfully real. Like Yuki's explanation about riding on the bike. Or drawing/reading comics and then reading over it objectively. Shit's too real. Not sure if anyone here has anxiety/shyness, but that's pretty much exactly how it goes, though that's obviously over-acted. Sometimes I feel like I should stop watching this stuff, because it hits pretty close to home a lot of the time.  To switch gears a bit to the other characters... I really enjoyed Asakura's meltdown. I felt like lots of character development was going on in that scene, and it's nice to see her character fleshed out more.  Koizumi's going along the trajectory I had hoped. I found it amusing how he gave Haruhi a boardgame. Figures.  Mikuru's still pretty much off the radar. She got what? A second of screen time?  And finally, the Tsuruya Factor. This episode gets a Naga-nyan/10. Not much screen time this episode, but still got lots of good frames. Squeezed in a few excellent lines (""Naga-Nyan"" and mentioning how Kyon's an animal). And I personally think it's worth noting that if Tsuruya hadn't appeared, there wouldn't be any physical contact between Yuki and Kyon. Clearly progressing the plot.  A weird thing I noticed was that Koizumi and Mikuru (who showed up with Tsuruya) are in their causal clothes. But Tsuruya is in a plain uniform and doesn't have her amazing coat. I wonder why that is?   With a bit of high school rabu rabu drama in it. HARUHI MOVING IN MARKING HER TERRITORY. WATCH OUT NAGATO, ANY MORE AND THIS WILL MEAN WAR.   Haruhi just needs to GTFO. And Koizumi needs to make his move already. He's almost as bad as Yuki."
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat May 2 11:09:17 2015 UTC,"This anime gets better with every new episode. I wasn't happy when I saw promo arts, but I loved first episode (and others too), though I didn't like Yuki's voice at first.  Now we know that it is not different universe because Haruhi totally remembers John Smith. Can't wait for the next episodes, my hype is too strong."
Haruhi,34jr6p,UndeadNightmare937,2,Fri May 1 22:06:21 2015 UTC,And the plot... thickens... with chocolate! :D

I really liked the scene where Asakura got pissed off as Haruhi.  As for Nagato confessing to Kyon... Mega manga spoilers. ... Seriously, Yen Press haven't even gotten to this yet."

Haruhi,34jr6p,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat May 2 11:15:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the spoilers are pretty big. It's almost equivalent to the idea of having spoilers for The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya in a thread about The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya IV in 2006."

I'm on mobile so I usually just click on the tag and go back a page, but it won't load any.   It's like I'm being punished for looking at that other spoiler."
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,2,Sun May 3 02:36:00 2015 UTC,"How does the John Smith thing work? If this takes place in another universe then it would be impossible for Kyon to have gone back in time, right? Was that part in the manga or are they skewing from the story to establish that this world does have a definite connection to the Melancholy world? Also, was he younger just with the same voice?  Either way, it was a great episode. The part where Asakura gets pissed off at Haruhi and yells at her was intense, one of the highlights of the episode. Nagato is still a little too clumsy for my tastes, but I'm hooked to the story. Let's see what next week has to offer."
Haruhi,34jr6p,UndeadNightmare937,3,Sat May 2 00:56:40 2015 UTC,"younger   Well... just fantasizing of course, but imagine: time travel could have happened (so she recognizes Kyon from her past) but she rationalizes that as a younger version of him since she ""knows"" it would be impossible for him to be exactly the same, and it was too dark to get the details. Having the same mature voice might be a hint, and not just laziness from the studio."
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat May 2 09:19:41 2015 UTC,"The John Smith scene was in the manga, albeit at the start of chapter 8 instead. (Equivalent to the start of episode 3.) It's never really elaborated on, so I guess you can just consider it middle school aged Kyon as opposed to time travel? It's not like he's wearing the North High uniform he had in the original series after all."
Haruhi,34jr6p,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Sat May 2 01:12:50 2015 UTC,"Why would he lie about his name, though? Seems kinda unusual for him to yell that last line at her.   Man, I was really hoping that they'd explain that part at least."
Haruhi,34jr6p,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat May 2 01:16:43 2015 UTC,"... Right, that line wasn't in the manga. The scene ended when Haruhi said ""I've completed my objective, see ya!"", so Kyon was not actually seen calling himself ""John Smith"" in the manga. In fact, I don't think the name ""John Smith"" has ever actually come up at all in the series. (Not 100% sure on that, but say, 97% sure at least.)"
Haruhi,34jr6p,Kafke,2,Sat May 2 01:25:01 2015 UTC,"Oh! Interesting...  That leaves the connection to Melancholy as a possibility, right? I'd love it if the last episode of the anime was followed by an announcement for S3 of Haruhi and/or a new LN. Maybe these references are meant to allude to something like that.   Nah, it's probably wishful thinking. I hope I'm wrong."
Haruhi,34jr6p,deathowm,1 point,Sat May 2 01:35:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, John Smith is mentioned in another 3 years ago flashback in chapter 35. When Haruhi calls him out on the obvious pseudonym, he says that it's better they don't know each others identities when their vandalizing of school property is discovered."
Haruhi,34jr6p,jereddit,1 point,Sat May 2 02:53:01 2015 UTC,"Is it ever revealed why this Kyon would bother helping Haruhi write the message or is that left in the air? Also, that still leaves the question of why Kyon would say that final line to her.   Sorry for all the questions, I just wasn't expecting for the John Smith scene to appear in this universe, let alone happen the way it did this episode."
Haruhi,34jr6p,bonghits96,1 point,Sat May 2 04:14:38 2015 UTC,"He was passing by and asked Haruhi what she was doing, she said she was breaking and entering and asked him to help her as ""the moment you didn't stop me, you became an accomplice"".  (It's also worth noting that Kyon doesn't even remember the event by this point, despite the fact that it's still important to Haruhi.)"
Haruhi,34jr6p,ghostFOUR7,2,Sat May 2 05:52:24 2015 UTC,"Nagato is still a little too clumsy for my tastes, but I'm hooked to the story.   Despite the over-acting and dramatization, her thought process this episode was painfully real."
Haruhi,34jr6p,Kafke,2,Sat May 2 11:16:23 2015 UTC,"The things I'd do to be Kyon when http://i.imgur.com/4RSsG4l.png  I was laughing the whole time because he just, stayed there. I would've too  HaruKyon will not survive, NagaKyon(????) is the only way."
Haruhi,34jr6p,Houreki,2,Sat May 2 02:08:52 2015 UTC,"Alright, finally caught up after falling behind after episode one.       It's still alright. Not as good as the original, but...it's a nice AU, I guess."
Haruhi,34jr6p,FatBabyBrother,2,Sat May 2 02:32:34 2015 UTC,Is that a Shamisen cameo at 23:35?
Haruhi,34jr6p,wardaniel9,2,Sat May 2 05:39:40 2015 UTC,"This version of Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody cut out the time travel, so there has to be some other reason Kyon was there and called himself John Smith. Also the art for that flashback was really good. The scene where Ryoko almost punches Haruhi was really good as well. It kind of showed that some of their flaws are still there, with Ryoko being too violent and Haruhi being a bitch. Tsuruya came in at exactly the wrong (or right?) time, although LN spoilers The opening and ending themes are growing on me, as well as the Japanese voices, although I still prefer the English ones. Next episode is titled ""Over the Obento"", so something about a boxed lunch? Also, I only just realised that Tsuruya only has one name. Funny that."
Haruhi,34jr6p,AusBox,2,Sat May 2 06:22:59 2015 UTC,"Tsuruya came in at exactly the wrong (or right?) time   Right, definitely right. Yuki would've chickened out. And no physical contact or head pillow would've happened. That and there wouldn't be a Tsuruya appearance.   The opening and ending themes are growing on me   I like the OP. The ending, though, I've been skipping. I'll have to give it another chance.   as well as the Japanese voices, although I still prefer the English ones.    Same. While I'm watching I keep thinking about how it'll sound with the english cast.   Also, I only just realised that Tsuruya only has one name   She actually doesn't. Tsuruya is her family name. We just don't know her given name."

Haruhi,33rv8b,blazzerftw,16,Sat Apr 25 00:49:54 2015 UTC,I think its funny that haruhi and kyon have already gotten as romantic in two episodes of this show than they ever did in TMOH excluding anything that happened in closed space. (because what happens in closed space stays is closed space)
Haruhi,33rv8b,harsh183,5,Sat Apr 25 01:23:59 2015 UTC,(because what happens in closed space stays is closed space) sigh

Haruhi,33rv8b,muskian,7,Sat Apr 25 08:24:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a really heartwarming moment. Scenes like those really help distinguish this series from the original. I'm loving every second!"
Haruhi,33rv8b,Kafke,9,Sat Apr 25 09:11:56 2015 UTC,"So it's the valentine's day episode... Seems like it's moving a bit fast. But I guess when you don't match it up to real life, it doesn't really matter. First impression is that it was absolutely fantastic. Just like good old haruhi. The haruhi scenes in particular I think brought a lot of that feeling. Though, like the other times, it feels a bit pushy about trying to reference the main series. Which is alright, but it really needs to just roll with it and add stuff, rather than constantly referencing back.  Another thing is that I'm still having problems adjusting to the subs. I think this is tinting my view of this anime, as it just feels off to see haruhi with a completely different voice. Kyon's a lot better though.  The Nagato makes chocolate scene was nice. I dunno what it was about it, but somehow it's nice to see Nagato be a complete klutz while remembering how she used to make chocolate. And the scene at the end. That just hurt. It hurt the feels so much.  I enjoyed the taniguchi/kunikida scene. I'm not sure if it's because I know how it feels, or because it's genuinely funny. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. It's nice to see them back.  Dat Mikuru/Yuki scene was amusing. I thought the captions were a nice touch. I'm glad Mikuru's not as lame as she is in the main series. Earning her place. I'm pleasantly surprised.  And now onto the best part of any episode review. The Tsuruya factor. I rate this episode a full Nyoron/10. I'm pretty sure with this much screen time, Tsuruya should officially be considered a main character. More Haruhi/Asakura/Tsuruya battles, which are always awesome. Lots of screen cap opportunities (if you haven't noticed), which are finally providing a lot of official material to pad my Tsuruya folder. Can this series just go on forever please?"
Haruhi,33rv8b,bonghits96,6,Sat Apr 25 11:28:18 2015 UTC,"Great comment, good screencaps, and I agree with you!  This series has gotten a lot better since the first ep.  A lot of the jokes made me smile, and I like what they're doing with characters like Mikuru and Ryoko.  Actually, the entire ensemble is treated fairly with the exception of Yuki herself, who seems a little too incompetent.  I thought the funniest part was how Nagato goes through this elaborate chocolate-making scene and Haruhi wins the day just by falling in a creek and buying a vending machine candy bar.  Fuckin' figures."
Haruhi,33rv8b,harsh183,10,Sat Apr 25 17:13:13 2015 UTC,"I really shipped Haruhi x Kyon but every time they switched to Yuki it hurt. The ending was like a knife to the heart. I knew what was coming but I could not help wishing somethings else happened instead.  The scene by the river was great. We saw both of their personalities really well. I really enjoyed it.  The scene where Yuki was making chocolate reminds me of the scene from the melancholy of haruhi-chan suzumiya.  Also everyone is forgetting that Koizumi has a crush on Haruhi. Maybe they'll sort it out in the next episode.  Imagine if Kyon goes back to the river sometime and finds it full of water imps.  The next episode is called 'her Melancholy', I'm really exited for it."
Haruhi,33rv8b,ghostFOUR7,2,Sun Apr 26 02:21:09 2015 UTC,I always thought Yuki x Koizumi would be nice from the Melancholy series. Both serious and competent. Leaves room for Kyon x Haruhi and Mikuru X Tsuruya.
Haruhi,33rv8b,harsh183,6,Thu Apr 30 02:22:34 2015 UTC,"I just want to say that Minori Chihara is an amazing singer.  I'm really enjoying the show so far. the scene we got with Haruhi and Kyon at the river was something we didn't get to see much in the original series: Haruhi acting like a normal human.  Also, as someone who was a big fan of Tsuruya and Asakura, I couldn't ask for much more. (except season 3 of course)  Yuki x Mikuru ?"
Haruhi,33rv8b,harsh183,4,Sat Apr 25 04:05:23 2015 UTC,I ship Mikuru X Yuki

Haruhi,33rv8b,SomethingAzn,5,Mon Apr 27 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"This episode was intense. Once Kyon and Haruhi were alone, and they kept cutting back to Nagato making the chocolates, I realized that the romantic tension was building up. Those last few moments were heart-pounding, if not a bit predictable, to say the least.  As much as it pains me to see Nagato get humiliated like that, I can't help but smile whenever Haruhi and Kyon are on the spotlight.  That river scene was really well done. Can't wait to see how they resolve this in the next episode."
Haruhi,33rv8b,little_eggroll,11,Sat Apr 25 18:25:31 2015 UTC,"Gosh, the way they cut between Haruhi and Nagato really struck me hard."

Haruhi,33rv8b,Kafke,5,Sat Apr 25 20:52:34 2015 UTC,"This week's episode was good. Covered chapters 11 and 12 (and the end of 10 at the start too). Haruhi was up to her typical Haruhi antics. Made a few comments here as per usual, not a whole lot to say though. Nice to see Taniguchi and Kunikida again even if it's all anime only filler."
Haruhi,33rv8b,SaiyamanMS,2,Sat Apr 25 00:55:57 2015 UTC,Nice to see Taniguchi and Kunikida again even if it's all anime only filler.   Is it? Everything you are saying is anime-only filler is absolutely hilarious. Kudos to whoever wrote those scenes.
Haruhi,33rv8b,UndeadNightmare937,5,Sat Apr 25 11:31:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, Taniguchi and Kunikida don't appear in the manga until chapter 43. (For comparison, Not super spoilery, but appears several chapters before they do in chapter 39.)"
Haruhi,33rv8b,SaiyamanMS,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:08:30 2015 UTC,"Since you seem to have read a lot, if not all of the Yuki-chan manga, I'd like to ask you a question. In terms of spoilers, does that character's place in Yuki-chan give away anything from the main series? As in does anything that happens with that character in the manga, which will probably be adapted, spoil anything substantial from the main story?  I'm in the middle of reading the Haruhi LNs, but I'm only at Disappearance, with the next four LNs being shipped to me as I type this. I doubt I'll be able to get through all of them by the time the anime is finished, so I was just wondering whether I should avoid the episodes once that character shows up, or if it would be fine to continue with it.  Of course, we don't know exactly how they'll adapt those parts, but I thought I should just ask anyway. Plus, I know who the character is from other comments online, just not exactly the importance of them."
Haruhi,33rv8b,UndeadNightmare937,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"The character's appearance in Yuki-chan gives away nothing about their role in the original novels. Of course, their history of being Totally minor detail prior to the start of the series is the same."

Haruhi,33rv8b,Captain_Gardar,3,Tue Apr 28 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm just loving how much of a presence that Tsuruya is becoming in the series. As /u/Kafke said, she's pretty much presented as a main character in this and should be considered as such."
Haruhi,33rv8b,retarded_oblong,5,Sun Apr 26 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"I knew it will end like this, I felt it from the point Kyon saved Haruhi from all the danger the river had to offer. While I approve of Haruhi x Kyon, I can't help but feel really sorry for Nagato.."
Haruhi,33rv8b,KenadianH,2,Sat Apr 25 07:48:51 2015 UTC,Is it just me or did Haruhi get taller.
Haruhi,33rv8b,SleepyShinji,2,Mon Apr 27 06:06:48 2015 UTC,"This scene didn't come at a surprise to me because of the previous scenes where they'd cut between Haruhi and Nagato, but it did hit me quite hard."
Haruhi,33rv8b,rinshankouhai,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"Most everyone has been saying what I came here to say, but yeah The Haruhi x Kyon that's been going on is probably my favorite part of this series (Haruhi is one of my favorite female anime characters of all time), but this show is supposed to be about Yuki. And Yuki is great. I love Yuki. So it makes me sad to see her sad. Even though it makes me happy to see Haruhi x Kyon"
Haruhi,33rv8b,batmaster96,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:44:20 2015 UTC,"This show has been super good so far, with the best point definitely being the absolutely killer expressions. My computer is going to explode from all the screencaps.   Since Haruhi showed up though, something slightly uncomfortable has been increasingly clear, which I'm hoping will be alleviated in eps 5 and beyond. I mean, being Haruhi, she obviously stole the show, and her presence here is just hilarious. But when it's contrasted with our wonderful and adorable Nagato-chan... it feels like she falls a little short.   As a character, she's super cute. By herself, I love her to death. But as an adaptation of Nagato, I feel like perhaps she's not quite there? The original has so much color and depth, and by fundamentally changing the character, I feel like she hasn't been interesting enough. All the other characters are hilarious and wonderful, but I've been increasingly feeling like Nagato is the weakest link in her own dedicated show. Maybe that's because all the other characters retain more of their original personality, whereas it feels like Nagato has been totally rewritten to increase her moe factor? I might even go so far as to say that her overt crush on Kyon feels slightly out of place, as to me it feels like an over-simplification of the original Nagato's feelings toward him, but that's a little nitpicky; it's a fairly lighthearted show, and that forms a rather convenient and adorable premise.  That's just me, though, and with all that being said, I still love Bizarro-Nagato and she's still ultra cute. I hope she gets plenty of her own moments to shine throughout the season.   Also, Terrifying Mom-Ryoko continues to be my favorite thing in the known multiverse."

Haruhi,33o49a,DarkStar5758,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:49:33 2015 UTC,"The characters change a bit from what we saw in the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. The most obvious is Yuki, who was almost as introverted as in the original universe, while she is more or less social here (shy and clumsy, but social within her small group). Kyon... I miss listening to his thoughts, but it's normal since he isn't the main character in this one. Haruhi at least feels like the same girl except for the lack of powers. Itsuki and Mikuru feel mostly the same, except obviously for no powers or time travel.  So it's basically Yuki trying to confess her feelings to Kyon, and I expect for Haruhi to become a rival or something like that."
Haruhi,33o49a,ladycygna,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:51:01 2015 UTC,and I expect for Haruhi Mikuru (with Tsuruya's help) to become a rival or something like that.   FTFY.

Haruhi,33o49a,SpaceOri,3,Fri Apr 24 03:58:42 2015 UTC,"No sci-fi. It's the universe as in Disappearance, but minus all the supernatural stuff. Kyon doesn't know shit.  It's pretty much gonna be a cutesy love story type thing, with comedy."
Haruhi,33o49a,Kafke,3,Fri Apr 24 07:16:29 2015 UTC,"I would say it is a continuation of Disappearance. Nagato had programmed it so that if kyon pushes the button, the past timeline with supernatural events would be replaced with a normal timeline. So it would be natural for kyon to possess no memory about the Melancholy."
Haruhi,33o49a,masonofchina,3,Fri Apr 24 14:42:04 2015 UTC,Just cutesy love story type for nagato and Kyon but Haruhi and everybody else will make an appearance without the supernatural part.

Haruhi,33mzpn,Kafke,2,Thu Apr 23 22:33:59 2015 UTC,"It follows the manga, which I think? is strictly a spin off.  Besides, how are they supposed to go back to the main universe when nobody has any powers? I suppose something along the lines of what Haruhi did ""three years ago"" could happen in this universe.. but that seems rather unlikely.."
Haruhi,33mzpn,Doughnutcake,2,Thu Apr 23 21:07:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's OK. But I have a feeling I'll resent its mere existence by the end of it.  Like that Soul Eater spinoff a few years ago.  It just lacks anything I liked about the original, but I guess as Haruhi is in it (who is pretty much the only character that is the same, outside of maybe Mikiru) I'll keep watching."
Haruhi,33mzpn,Canadia86,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"Well the novels tend to have parallel stories going on, maybe something like that could cause the old storyline to mix in.

Haruhi,32ysmj,Kafke,7,Tue Apr 21 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see Haruhi again. And it seems that she is no different in this adaption then from any other medium. That's a huge plus in my book.  This series doesn't seem to work in the same context as the normal series. Everything here is a little more wild and over the top. It's as if TMoHS and Haruhi-chan had a baby. So I don't think this was intended to be taken quite as seriously as the TMoHS.  That being said, the fight scene between Tsuruya and Haruhi was indeed hilarious. The fact that Haruhi tried to launch Kyon and Koizumi at Tsuruya is just incredible. Of coarse, this is Haruhi we are talking about here."
Haruhi,32ysmj,UndeadNightmare937,3,Fri Apr 17 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"It's as if TMoHS and Haruhi-chan had a baby.   I couldn't have said it better myself. At first I was a bit hesitant how this anime would fare, but it's starting to stick now."
Haruhi,32ysmj,ConspicuousClockwork,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:24:34 2015 UTC,"It's as if TMoHS and Haruhi-chan had a baby.    That's exactly how it feels. Give or take a couple modifications.   That being said, the fight scene between Tsuruya and Haruhi was indeed hilarious. The fact that Haruhi tried to launch Kyon and Koizumi at Tsuruya is just incredible. Of coarse, this is Haruhi we are talking about here.   Admit it. Tsuruya carried the episode :P"
Haruhi,32ysmj,SomethingAzn,6,Sun Apr 19 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry Nagato, but even in your show, Haruhi is still best girl.  Seriously though, this episode was fantastic. Haruhi really helped make the humor shine and for a second I felt like I was watching Melancholy again. Kyon also finally felt more like his regular self, with all the classic Haruhi bickering still intact. I hope it keeps this vibe for most of the show.  That ending song is still beautiful.   Oh, and fatblackninja, I'm pretty sure that panties quote was from the Disappearance movie, or at least something extremely similar. I watched it very recently, so that's where I remember it from."
Haruhi,32ysmj,synthwizard,2,Sat Apr 18 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry Nagato, but even in your own show, Haruhi is still best girl.   Ouch, reading that hurt haha. But to those who are faithful to the original, it makes sense. Similar to what /u/iEzhik said, Haruhi brought out the Kyon everyone is familiar with.   And I figured it was from somewhere, though I just couldn't remember haha. Thanks for confirming my suspicions haha"
Haruhi,32ysmj,Jeremynow,6,Sat Apr 18 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"I found it really interesting that they confirmed that haruhi maintained her meta powers,  as seen when she reads kyons thoughts like in previous shows"
Haruhi,32ysmj,otakuman,2,Sat Apr 18 03:38:01 2015 UTC,I didn't even realize it was his thoughts! I just assumed he said it out loud.
Haruhi,32ysmj,Jeremynow,5,Sun Apr 19 08:29:36 2015 UTC,It's not even really clear what he says out loud and does't

Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"Totally, it's starting to feel more like the Melancholy. It'll be interesting to see the way the club acts with these new personality."
Haruhi,32ysmj,wardaniel9,4,Fri Apr 17 23:11:37 2015 UTC,kyon still digging that ponytail I see. Hehe. anyways though I do agree with OP thats the Haruhi in the beginning felt a little bit forced. I also feel like this series got about 50% more entertaining whenever she is in scene. she even makes the other characters feel more in place.
Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,2,Fri Apr 17 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"Towards the end, everything started to feel right.   And by right I mean just like old times haha"
Haruhi,32ysmj,SaiyamanMS,7,Tue Apr 21 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"So the gang is back together, I don't know if I like that I was hoping for a new dynamic, but i guess that's what people want...  At first I was mad cuz Haruhi background music didn't come out when she first appeared but then in the end it all made sense..  Johnny Yong Bosch is so much better as Koizumi than that other guy, the guy that does Kyon too, even the Haruhi is better dub...."
Haruhi,32ysmj,Grey1914,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:15:01 2015 UTC,Your probably going to get hate for liking the dub but I say screw it .  The haruhi dub definitely had some good actors but it's not a perfect dub . I Thought haruhi sounded to old and moe anime in general loses alot in translation. Crispin freeman is awesome though . My benchmark for dubs is cowboy bebop if you were wondering .
Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,3,Sat Apr 18 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"This is not a dub vs sub thing, Crispin Freeman IS Kyon, no debate, and if you don't think so then you're just lying to yourself...... also Johnny Yong Bosch (is everywhere, i know) but always solid, and who ever did Haruhi was really good, that's all I have to say... and the whole moe thing is just creepy for us westerners so I'm glad they sound older, C'mon they are like 16 years old not 5...."
Haruhi,32ysmj,appropriate-username,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:15:24 2015 UTC,"It was wendee lee who played haruhi , aya hirano doesn't sound five ... It seems like I pushed your buttons that wasn't my intention I was just being honest . I watch more simulcasts these days but I'm not a purest I enjoy a good dub ."
Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,3,Sat Apr 18 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am not a fan of Wendee Lee as Haruhi at all, but the rest of the cast is absolutely stellar, especially Crispin Freeman as Kyon. The Japanese version is all around solid though, especially Tomokazu Sugita as Kyon and Aya Hirano as Haruhi."
Haruhi,32ysmj,Kafke,3,Sat Apr 18 06:36:01 2015 UTC,"I think I am the only person who liked Wendee Lee Haruhi, but I also am very easily pleased so..."
Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,2,Sun Apr 19 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty much the same way , I have nothing against wendee lee but I just though she wasn't a good fit for haruhi . Like alot of people I watched the show as it was airing and watched the dub later ."
Haruhi,32ysmj,Luy22,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:56:55 2015 UTC,"I just though she wasn't a good fit for haruhi    Agreed. A bit too bossy/snotty, imo."
Haruhi,32ysmj,razorlikeblue,2,Sat Apr 18 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"I just think she sounded to old for the character , I was expecting some one like kari wahlgren or laura bailey to play haruhi at that time ."
Haruhi,32ysmj,JailbaitRarity,2,Sat Apr 18 20:41:29 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, Kyon/Haruhi are the two characters I really don't like in the Japanese version. Everyone else is fine (Koizumi sounds a bit off but w/e)."
Haruhi,32ysmj,1tobedoneX,2,Sun Apr 19 22:17:33 2015 UTC,I personally don't care. I prefer subs but... different strokes man.  Can't really get mad at someone for liking something different. Just my opinion
Haruhi,32ysmj,JailbaitRarity,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:12:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not mad just being honest , I guess I'm a bit to blunt ."
Haruhi,32ysmj,1tobedoneX,2,Sat Apr 18 06:37:51 2015 UTC,Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon are A+ dubs IMO
Haruhi,32ysmj,Spazzo965,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:21:07 2015 UTC,So are Baccano and FMA . Pretty much anything with steve blum or crispin freeman are worth watching .

Haruhi,32ysmj,synthwizard,3,Sat Apr 18 08:14:31 2015 UTC,"Surprising amount of filler this episode, am disappointed by the lack of ponytail Nagato, but overall fairly solid. As always, made a few other notes about things on my Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsuisou translation blog."
Haruhi,32ysmj,harsh183,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:19:37 2015 UTC,"Wow, is that a blog just about the whole Suzumiya franchise? What exactly do you write about? Looks interesting."
Haruhi,32ysmj,Luy22,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:02:37 2015 UTC,I mostly just translate material from the Japan only video games. Mostly from Suzumiya Haruhi no Tsuisou or The Reminiscences of Haruhi Suzumiya.
Haruhi,32ysmj,Houreki,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:18:10 2015 UTC,Cool! Are you fluent in Japanese and/or have experience with translating from Japanese to English and vice versa?
Haruhi,32ysmj,Kafke,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:11:46 2015 UTC,"Not native level fluent or anything, but good enough to get about. I've cleared the JLPT level N3. I have no professional translation experience, but plenty of fan-translation stuff. (A lot of which is on the aforementioned blog.) I'm reasonably confident translating from Japanese to English for the most part, not quite as much from English to Japanese though."
Haruhi,32ysmj,appropriate-username,3,Mon Apr 20 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Having just watched Haruhi last year, it's great to have more. so many references. Frog costume. Baseball gear. Line marking. Then there was the reference to snow mountain syndrome.  Tsuruya's just incredible as always. she wasn't around much in the anime series, so its nice to have her back, along with Asakura.  The only thing it's missing is an English dub. I'm Kinda hoping Funimation does a simuldub."
Haruhi,32ysmj,DevoutHaruhiist,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was great it so everything coming together. Looks like it's going to be quite similar to the Melancholy, but I look forward to how the new characters will change the dynamic!"
Haruhi,32ysmj,deathowm,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:16:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was able to predict up to this episode. Kyon and Nagato, Haruhi jumping in, everyone is now together again. Maybe not how I originally planned it, but meh. Now, I seriously have no idea where the show will go.  Having not read the manga, I'm looking forward to some surprises =D"
Haruhi,32ysmj,appropriate-username,2,Tue Apr 21 23:00:25 2015 UTC,This episode felt much more Haruhi like. The references like asking Nagato is she is a alien and hoping that Koizumi has mysterious powers and comes from a mysterious organisation.   The humour was back on and it felt great. Having Haruhi on screen was big boost on the whole anime.  Earlier I was feeling skeptical if I should watch this but this episode really made fell like watching this.   Haruhi with pony tails is 36% more cuter as usual. I do wish Nagato good luck with her future pony tail.
Haruhi,32ysmj,deathowm,2,Sat Apr 18 10:41:33 2015 UTC,"As soon as Haruhi showed up with Mikuru all I said was ""It begins."""
Haruhi,32ysmj,SomethingAzn,2,Sat Apr 18 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"I like this episode more than the other 2, the references to the movie are strong, I'll watch it again once this series finish.  Is it just me or I remember Koizumi's voice different?"
Haruhi,32ysmj,appropriate-username,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"It's Ono Daisuke still, so it should be similar?  Given that he hasn't voiced this role in a few years, there may be some slight differences, but overall should be the same"
Haruhi,32ysmj,Bioman2222,2,Tue Apr 21 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"I seem to be the outlier here, but I felt like all the main-series references were really forced in. Like in a weird ""hey, remember this? Lawl!"" way. It killed a lot of the episode for me. And Haruhi seems to be suffering from the same thing as Kyon: part of the character is kept, but then a lot was rewritten where needed. It comes off as a bit awkward, but perhaps that's just because I'm used to the main series.  Everything started to feel a bit more 'normal' once the whole cast was back together for those last few minutes, so hopefully we'll see more of that.  On the bright side, I finally applauded Mikuru's presence this time. Where she appeared as just ""more shit"" that Haruhi brings in. Laughed so hard at that.  Yuki's giving me emotional whiplash. Jumping from Moe/Shy-trope character with emotions pumped up to the extreme, back to regular old Yuki. It's a bit distracting.  And now for the best part of any episode, the Tsuruya factor. Gonna be honest here, I was worried she wasn't going to make it into this episode. I usually skim the episodes before hand to ensure they downloaded correctly, and to get a general ""teaser"" before I actually sit down and watch. And I didn't see any Tsuruya. But then  BAM! out of nowhere she appeared and brought plenty of life into the episode. The little combat scene had me cracking up. And I was a bit surprised at Mori's appearance (cropped out :P). Overall I'd rate the Tsuruya factor infectious/10.  But please, no more forced references. It's awkward and weird."
Haruhi,32ysmj,Genbodeau,2,Sun Apr 19 08:42:34 2015 UTC,"Where she appeared as just ""more shit"" that Haruhi brings in. Laughed so hard at that.   I wish they'd left the method of how Haruhi got her a mystery to make the scene funnier."

Haruhi,32yjnd,Timbo_KZ,3,Fri Apr 17 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"What does ""Hesu"" and ""ESTREE ratio"" mean?"

Why would we suggest you not to watch the series and movie? Do you don't like experience amazing things? seriously dude, c'mon. The manga doesn't do the franchise justice, is very subpar. It skips or rushes parts. There's no big tension like the Novel, series or movie brings."
Haruhi,32svon,SpaceOri,3,Thu Apr 16 21:54:30 2015 UTC,I was about to type what you typed.  The manga doesn't do the franchise justice since it lacks many things (like Kyon's narration).
Haruhi,32svon,Zinx10,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know, from what I've read between the first volume of the light novels and the first volumes of the manga, I'd be inclined to say the manga compares favourably enough. I mean translating volumes of texts  between two languages with substantial structural differences didn't do the LN's any favour. It was definitely entertaining but didn't feel fantastically well written, of course the same can be said for the manga but the visuals (especially as the artwork improves as you read through the manga) can make up for what it lacks most of the time when compared to the novels. I agree that kyon's narration is downplayed in the manga though."

Haruhi,325nu2,Genbodeau,3,Sun Apr 12 15:49:06 2015 UTC,My body is ready!
Haruhi,325nu2,Volticore,5,Sun Apr 12 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying that the quality of the animation is top notch. I don't even mind the redesign of most of the characters. The humor is great, just as it was on ep 1. The intro is really nice with all teh girls dancing on it.  I like a lot teh participation of Asakura as a real girl within the gang, along with Tsuruya.  Now... I'm sorry but i totally dislike this Yuki version. I understand it's suposed to be an alternate reality and this is a different persona she embraced. But it's way way too different from the real Yuki. Instead of what coudl have been a quiet serious smart girl she becomes completely clumsy, shy, and even dorky. Is that really what real Yuki would wish for? I know it's all to add her ""kawaii"" points since she is the focus of the show. But to me it's annoying, it's just way too much. She is a living cliché of a romance anime character. On the other side Kyon is like a chair, he has no personality, no real participation. It feels he is just there as a goal for Yuki, so far he does absolutely nothing meaningful. He is the usual quiet guy who is the object of desire of our ""heroine"". The Kyon i know is fueled completely as an antagonist to the force that Haruhi is. Which is another issue i have, how will Haruhi and Kyon work in here? Will she have any interest in him? Will he on her? Or will she be reduced as a crazy side character who steps in while the boring love story develops. Maybe I'm judging way too early since it's been only 2 episodes, but what has been portrayed here is a love story formula I've seen hundreds of times in different anime shows, shy girl loves boy, shy girl spends all show gathering courage to confess while friends encourage and support her.   So that is my personal take on the show, it's funny how i really like everything about the show except for the main two characters."

Haruhi,325nu2,Doughnutcake,3,Fri Apr 10 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Despite all my hating on Yuki last episode, this episode is much better. Feels like the show did yet another 180. Much closer to the typical Haruhi feel.  Not much noteworthy about the episode in particular. Just solid content all the way through. Less Tsuruya this time, which made me a bit sad. But in return we got a glorious laugh.  Asakura is turning out to be a great character. Though I don't think that's much of a surprise (I've liked her character in everything she's appeared in).  Kyon still feels off. Perhaps I'm just missing Crispin Freeman as his voice.  I think this is the best way to describe my reaction to this anime so far."
Haruhi,325nu2,Bioman2222,2,Fri Apr 10 23:36:18 2015 UTC,"As a non-tsuruya person, I must say this is making her appeal go way up. Not bad, not bad at all.  And I just can't feel Kyon either. Somethings off, but this series could have been way worse"
Haruhi,325nu2,deathowm,2,Sat Apr 11 21:36:38 2015 UTC,I really like Asakura as well! I'm glad we got to see more of what she is like as opposed to the Melancholy.

It's not cutting anything big at all and everything we see is productive in some way, comedy, drama, etc. Hopefully Haruhi fans will be more pleased, as she is going to have a big presence for the rest of the anime (except for one arc, which honestly is the most say, ""Haruhi-ish"" arc). The OP is cute, and hell Haruhi's paralleled with Nagato! I have no complaints about how this is going along.   I see this in a positive light more than most because this whole AU is what Nagato wanted. Everything she bottled up to the disappearance led her to create, well, this. This anime portrays what Nagato wanted and honestly deserved being the ""tragic character"" (as otakuman put it last thread, which was a good point) of the group. I love Nagato in all shapes forms and personalities so, yeah.  P.S - Tsuruya fans, Mikuru fans, Haruhi fans, you will get your best girl screen time. I think Tsuruya is in this more than the original anime (Don't take my word, but she's here often)."

Haruhi,325nu2,YogurtBatmanSwag,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Haruhi's paralleled with Nagato   I really, really loved how this AU Haruhi essentially is the factor that pushes Nagato to move forward with her goal of saving the Literature Club. The reversal from the main series, where Haruhi essentially runs all over Nagato's club to create the SSS Brigade, is really satisfying—and not just in a ""look how awesome Haruhi is"" way, but also just in the neat way it packages both universes together."
Haruhi,325nu2,YogurtBatmanSwag,2,Sun Apr 12 02:28:56 2015 UTC,highlight of the episode for me is when haruhi shows up and..well...starts doing haruhi stuff. im glad shes still her zanny self considering much of the cast in this show just seems a little off from the original series. especially kyon
Haruhi,325nu2,DarkStar5758,3,Sat Apr 11 23:38:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. Still have yet to hear from Koizumi but I'm kinda hoping he's still Mr. Pretty-boy Bishounen he always was. Wouldn't feel right if he wasn't.   AND WHY WAS HARUHI IN THE BUSHES DURING SNOW WINTER HARUHI DON'T GET A COLD PLS LEARN2HEALTH
Haruhi,325nu2,otakuman,2,Sun Apr 12 06:32:46 2015 UTC,"I think you're forgetting how much of a oddball Haruhi is. The better question is, Why wouldn't Haruhi be in the bushes?"
Haruhi,325nu2,Luy22,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:41:57 2015 UTC,learn to health! she was sick like 2 time in the anime once she was absent from school and she was also sick on the murder mystery episode.  you think god would have better health

Haruhi feels just like she should, hopefully she'll shake up that rom com a bit.   Still didn't get used to Nagato, waiting for her to pick up an SG (... well maybe not for now), rest of the cast was great, OP was ok, orginal soudtrack had amazing timing, can't wait for next episode.

Haruhi,325gc8,deathowm,5,Fri Apr 10 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"I understood it as; she's read that turkey is part of a ""Real Christmas"". She's finally not alone anymore, so she wanted to finally experience a Real Christmas with her friends and not-yet-boyfriend. Thus all the parts of a Real Christmas including turkey and snow got hyped up in her mind. Getting real turkey means she gets a real christmas, and part of a real christmas is spending time with your friends and loved ones.  For a readily available analogy, think of weeaboos hyping up little thing from Japan in their mind like convenience stores. I mean it's just a convenience store, right?

Tsuruya-san now feels 175% more annoying thanks to not having a *certain* person around to be a comparison. Thanks to Sugita's performance, Kyon had more tsukkomi moment (for a lack of better word at the moment) compared to manga. LOL Asakura is humming Hare Hare Yukai.   Overall, not bad, not bad at all.

Haruhi,31rhol,Doughnutcake,5,Tue Apr 7 17:11:21 2015 UTC,Just never seen anything like it. The surface level stuff is great but all the subtleties and the non-linear story is what really gets me. It has everything.
Haruhi,31rhol,Ra5han,4,Tue Apr 7 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't really know what I was watching at first, since I learned about the anime from an AMV. The long explanation by Nagato in episode 3 almost made me skip the whole series but I kept watching to see if it was any good after that. Oh boy was that a good decision, I love that series to death! The inner monologues by Kyon about what's going on are pretty funny when Haruhi is messing up Asahina-san or something else. The series as a whole is very enjoyable because it's talking about a very serious subject in a sort of light-hearted way, since it after all is an anime, but the whole feel of the show is so great.   The fact that Haruhi does what she does because anything else would be boring is great. Why would you live a dull life when you could spice it up without any real consequences? Well, at least that she knows of. Kyon has to save her every time. In my opinion, this show has so many different elements that makes it great, and I just love that it's so silly but still pretty deep. It's not like the thing about the whole world ending is silly, but nobody can deny that Haruhi every now and then makes us crack a smile.  Maybe I'm just still over-looking all of its flaws, I know there definitely are some, but I still really like the show in general because of its seriousness and sillyness."

Haruhi,31rhol,Zanamee,3,Tue Apr 7 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"Haruhi could be called my gateway anime.  I'd only ever watched a little Dragonball back in 2000-something and nothing ever since.   When I went back to uni in September last year one of my flatmates told me to start watching SAO. I decided to watch the first episode but didn't really dig it. A couple of days later someone sent me a link to r/anime and one of the threads mentioned this anime with it's espers, time travelers and aliens and I though it was gonna be a sci-fi epic!  I began watching and although it wasn't a sci-fi epic I wasn't disappointed. I fell in love with all the characters, the setting and the relationships they all built and because of that I marathon-ed both series's and the movie in about 5 days!  Since then though I've been enjoying a lot more anime, so it's all thanks to Haruhi and co!"
Haruhi,31rhol,SwanX17,2,Tue Apr 7 21:37:43 2015 UTC,"Well here's my spiel.  I have never been a fan of anime high school dramas.  The characters aren't believable, the situations are ridiculously silly, and they have nothing going for them but silly comedy and a romance that you hope comes to something eventually.    TMOS on the other hand has incredibly real characters.  Kyon is to me the realist character in all of anime.  His thoughts are similar to mine own, and probably to a lot of people judging by the comments on this thread.  Furthermore he is a very normal person.  There is nothing that sets him apart from your average everyday high school guy.  The other characters are great as well, but since Kyon is narrating he is the one we know the best.     The silly situations make sense.  In a lot of anime a ton of rediculus over the top stuff happens all of the time, because hey this is anime and we don't have to obey the rules of a normal world.  TMOHS has a reason for all of this.  A really good one too.    On top of the insanely interesting idea that God is just one of us at any given time bending the world ever so slightly to our will is awesome.  The whole ""Haruhi is God"" idea is what really sets this anime apart.  On top of a high school drama you have a great sci fi story.  Every bit of the show has implications in the regular world, which Haruhi experiences, and the sci fi world which she doesn't even know exists.  The duality makes for a great watch, because you have no idea what will happen next at any point in the show.    There are other reasons of course; the great animation, the soundtrack, the voice acting, the romance triangle, the fact that no one knows the main characters real name and the great supporting cast outside of the main five.  Those are the reasons I love the show anyways."
Haruhi,31rhol,xxninjatacoxx,2,Wed Apr 8 00:08:13 2015 UTC,"I think the way it's narrated really adds to the story. Also I really really like Kyon as a character, he feels a lot more 'real' than a lot of the oblivious yet kind etc etc MC's from a lot of anime. While he sorta does those things, the way he acts is just a lot more believable, and the plot was really good IMO."

I feel like every time I watch/read it I'm introduced to new ideas and ways of thinking. As well as get to enjoy the interactions between the characters (who are all fantastic).  That, and I love the fact that there's an alien, time traveler, and esper all in the same series. That's pretty much what got me to watch it in the first place.  I'm a sucker for time travel, so pretty much anything that includes it is already starting off on a good foot.  Relatedly, I feel like the best parts of the series are when it capitalizes on all this. Stuff like Disappearance/Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, Endless 8, etc.  Amusingly, I find that my thoughts are the exact opposite of your friend's. Every anime I watch, I feel like they just keep getting worse and worse, and more bland. But I chalk it up to the fact that I'm watching more niche and lesser quality stuff than when I first began (I started with stuff like Baccano, Death Note, Haruhi, Steins;Gate, etc).  And naturally my post wouldn't be complete without saying Tsuruya. Who makes it all the better.  Does that answer the question? I'm the type of person who likes the idea of the endless 8."

Haruhi,31diq7,SpaceOri,11,Sat Apr 4 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"Just an opinion: I think you should put the full real name ""Nagato Yuki-chan no Shoushitsu"" not just Nagato-chan. Just to keep it nice and pro. I know I'm being picky... sorry.    I had enough of the old art style discussion with Yuki-chan and Yahari. It all comes down to the production team to keep the pace enjoyable and not boring.   Manga Spoilers   Well, that's all for me. ugh, I sound very negative. Maybe I should delete this, please really tell me if I should. I like being clear with my comments when it comes to Haruhi, that's why the wall of text, hahaha.   Should I post this on a separate post and not here?"
Haruhi,31diq7,DevoutHaruhiist,7,Sat Apr 4 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"I really agree with you. The original show went to make fun of a bunch of the cliches that were around and made fun of the fan service most shows provide. But this anime seems like it was made to be just that. Fan service to something people really loved in Disappearance and nothing more. Depending on how far into the series they want go, it could get more interesting, but if they don't change the writing a bit, it will be nothing more than ""generic anime show."""
Haruhi,31diq7,masonofchina,2,Sat Apr 4 06:05:49 2015 UTC,"I really hope they would continue the story of Disappearance in the the nagato anime, with kyon choosing nagato rather than haruhi. Then we can see kyon adjusting to the new world, how he might regret losing haruhi and tons of reference from old series. This is a far more interesting plot rather than typical rom-com we now gave."
Haruhi,31diq7,Zinx10,10,Thu Apr 9 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"I found it fairly enjoyable and very faithful to the original manga.  The changes they did make, however, were nice references to the original series, thus I am perfectly okay with it.  I have only read the first volume of Nagato-chan, and I found it good but different.  It just seemed to lack the true charm that the original series had, but that isn't always a bad thing.  Another thing I found was it appeared cliche with what events happened.  Either way, I am extremely excited for this and I hope it does well (not only for the hopes season 3).  P.S. I love the art style, but I think it shouldn't be the main series art style (season 3)."
Haruhi,31diq7,deathowm,2,Sat Apr 4 02:33:42 2015 UTC,The manga lives on all the cliches you normally see. I didn't mind because seeing the Haruhi crew do it was fun. And cute outfits...and Nagato being cute all throughout...
Haruhi,31diq7,Zinx10,1 point,Sat Apr 4 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, and maybe this will do cliches right (like the original Haruhi series), but I guess the manga or the anime, in due time, will tell."

Haruhi,31diq7,deathowm,7,Sat Apr 4 23:03:21 2015 UTC,"I think the art looks great. It fits this genre/style that Nagato-chan is. Its cute, looks good, and stays true to its source...so far. The more Nagato the better!  Although, I'll probably never end up saying anything negative about this anime, because I have been and still will be vehemently defending it, all while knowing why it may not be for some Haruhi-goers."
Haruhi,31diq7,Kafke,7,Sat Apr 4 01:21:02 2015 UTC,"Just finished watching the first episode. It's.... weird. Kyon feels entirely different, as I expected. He still has some ""Kyon-ness"" to him, which keeps me grounded, but there's a lot of straying. In a good way though.  Yuki is easily the worst of the bunch. I hate to say it. She got changed from a character with depth to a cliche shy gag character. Great for the comedy, awful for the character. Hopefully there'll be improvement as the series goes on. To contrast with the movie, in the movie, she had subtlety. Not so much here. Perhaps it's just to make the style of the show fit a bit better, but it's a bit off-putting. Either way, it's not enough to harm the show, and I feel people who haven't seen the main series would be fine.  Asakura is a bit different than I remember her. Took a different kind of road with her. Closer to the Haruhi-chan spin-off, IMO. At first I wasn't sure, but with the introduction of her rivalry with Tsuruya, it cemented her place as a solid character.  Tsuruya is awesome. I had a tsuruya-gasm watching this. I'm not sure if that scene was a good third of the episode or more, or if it was just a time distortion field. No complaints. Just tell me there's more coming.  Mikuru is a static pole. As usual. Just that character you want to get out of the way. On a side note, I find her Japanese VA much more pleasing. No time travel gimmick means that I'm not going to be enjoying much of her screen time.  Now onto the show itself. The comedy is fantastic. I found myself cracking up quite a few times. Asakura helps a lot here. The Asakura/Yuki/Kyon trio reminds me a lot of the scenes in Haruhi-chan again. Same kind of dynamic it seems. As I mentioned earlier, Yuki has some good scenes, though perhaps not for her character.  The direction of the show seems pretty obvious. But I'm curious if Tsuruya is going to be used as a sort of antagonist. As it seems that's how she was used in this episode. And I'm curious as to how/when Haruhi and Koizumi are going to show up. Definitely excited to see how they are.  Either way, I'm excited for more. The hype is legit."
Haruhi,31diq7,wardaniel9,2,Sun Apr 5 06:55:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah they had to change Yuki because that old character wouldn't be able to lead a show(IMO), she barely spoke and had no/few reactions to her surrounding. I was surprised how different she was too, but I'm OK with the character so far..."
Haruhi,31diq7,Kafke,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yup. What I imagined when I first heard about it was Yuki from the movie, and slowly opening up and being more expressive over time. Something closer to say I love you. With either Kyon or Asakura pulling the plot along.  As it stands, she's very un-""yuki""like. If they were going to go for a more expressive/comedic yuki, the direction they went for Haruhi-chan would be much better. Still hilarious, and still has that Yuki-charm.  As I mentioned, it's easily the worst part of the show, but was done to make it all flow and fit better. If you ignore what you remember yuki to be, then it all works out fine."
Haruhi,31diq7,Poketoa,1 point,Sun Apr 5 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm a sucker for this sort of thing but... if you do look at it like ""This is how she could've been if the IDSE/IDTE/DO didn't create her to be incapable of expressing emotion,"" it looks like if those barriers were dropped, this would be the sort of person she'd have become. This version of her has had a little bit of time to open up a bit to Kyon already, and she's already been close to Asakura for a while... But that's just me. We saw her in this form still being completely shy in the movie, in all technicality, but given the couple weeks that Kyon's already been a part of the club, she's already started to move past that by the time this anime starts... Valid points made, though. She's definitely not that unexpressive character, but it does seem like this could be the next logical step past where her character would have been in the movie appearance... your mileage may vary on this excuse though of course."
Haruhi,31diq7,Kafke,2,Tue Apr 7 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"it looks like if those barriers were dropped, this would be the sort of person she'd have become.   Ehh, I'm not so sure. The movie yuki is drastically different from the new anime.   We saw her in this form still being completely shy in the movie, in all technicality, but given the couple weeks that Kyon's already been a part of the club, she's already started to move past that by the time this anime starts...   Perhaps. I think it might just be more of the style of the show and how yuki fits into it, rather than the raw character herself. As I mentioned in a different comment, it's a more 'expressive' type of shyness. It's not really about how 'open' she is, but how expressive and the way she reacts to things. Again, as I mentioned in the other comment, it's more like they just grabbed the random shy character comedy trope, and slapped it onto yuki. Rather than developing yuki from her roots into the role.   She's definitely not that unexpressive character, but it does seem like this could be the next logical step past where her character would have been in the movie appearance... your mileage may vary on this excuse though of course.   Maybe. As I said, it still fits the show fine. It just doesn't really have that yuki essence to it. As if the character was fitted to the role, rather than the role fitting the character.  Though I think a lot of my dislike stems from the show's style influencing character actions, rather than the characters themselves.  You can have a character open up while being shy and still be subtle. I was more of expecting this and this or even something like this (perhaps with a bit more emotion) rather than something like this (which, to be honest, hurt to watch).  Just feels like a complete 180, simply done to fulfill a trope."

Haruhi,31diq7,in-sanity,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting since 2013 too. Also remember, Kyon has no memory of the previous world, and considering how out-load and noticeable Tsuruya is, it's not hard to imagine she's run into Kyon and made him a Mikuru fan club member."

Haruhi,31diq7,AusBox,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've only watched the anime, but I feel Asakura needed some more attention. It was kind of scary seeing her the first time, but I like what Nagato, her and Kyon have going on. Lots of female characters so far and no males (beside Kyon). I want to see the return of Taniguchi and Kunikida."
Haruhi,31diq7,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Tue Apr 7 04:56:35 2015 UTC,I can't get over the feeling that Asakura is going to try and kill Kyon again.
Haruhi,31diq7,GrayStandard,2,Sun Apr 5 07:33:55 2015 UTC,Didn't like the first episode. It pretty much took all the good parts out of TMoHS and moeifed the rest.  Only going to keep watching due to the voice actors being the same as the original series.
Haruhi,31diq7,DevoutHaruhiist,3,Wed Apr 8 03:36:45 2015 UTC,I have a feeling I'll be hating the next few weeks. :(
Haruhi,31diq7,Zinx10,2,Sat Apr 4 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in the same boat about Yuki. I like her character as a whole and connected with her at many point. But she by no means stands out as special to me. Iv'e always loved Haruhi the most. She has her flaws, but who doesn't? She is always so excited and happy about life. And that has always connected with me the most.  But hey, that's just my opinion. Haruhi and Yuki seem to be the fan favorites of the series. I often equate them to people's love for Asuka and Rei in the NGE universe."
Haruhi,31diq7,DevoutHaruhiist,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"Haruhi has no flaws!  But yeah. Nothing interesting about Yuki. She fills her role, which is fine, but that's all."
Haruhi,31diq7,Licargon,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:52:15 2015 UTC,Why is that?
Haruhi,31diq7,otakuman,2,Sat Apr 4 02:25:50 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I very much hate yuki and this show is going to usher in the ""Omg Yuki so amazing!"" mentality I very much hate. :(   I just need more of my Haruhi. :)"
Haruhi,31diq7,DevoutHaruhiist,4,Sat Apr 4 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I ""hate"" Yuki, I just don't understand that idiotic obsession with her. Having read the LN's, I like her backstory and what she does, but I just can't wrap my head around the entire ""Yuki = best girl""-act. She isn't that interesting in the end... :/"
Haruhi,31diq7,Kafke,9,Sat Apr 4 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"It's in part her role. She ends up falling in love with Kyon, and she's already condemned to lose him because Haruhi wants him, and she's not a person / being who will take 'no' for an answer. Nagato is the underdog, the tragic heroine who mourns for her love. She's got no appeal, no Moe, she's not even busty to attract the lewd gazes of horny men. She's invisible, designed only to be a watchtower, a living furniture and at the same time has to bear the weight of protecting the brigade all by herself. She got ill in Snow Mountain syndrome, she got bored to hell in Endless Eight.  She is a character meant to inspire the reader's compassion. The fact that she cannot smile after the events in Disappearance is even more heart wrenching.  Maybe this is what makes her a favorite for some readers. Maybe this is what made Puyo write her own happy ending."
Haruhi,31diq7,Zinx10,2,Sat Apr 4 15:12:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly. My take on it was always ""Hey! She's nerdy, quiet, and shy like me me! What a great character!"" since that's how anime watching folks always appeared to me. I'm on the Haruhi side of the spectrum which really couldn't be further. :P"
Haruhi,31diq7,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much exactly how I see Nagato. And as such, she's not quite a favorite, but definitely up there.  That said, nothing can replace Tsuruya as best girl."

Haruhi,31diq7,SpaceOri,2,Sun Apr 5 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"In the context of the series, echoes of a different world. Out of context, ever have that weird feeling walking by a certain person? Like you feel like you might have known them before, but obviously never could have? Like you're somehow connected to that person, but don't even know their name? That's the feeling."
Haruhi,31diq7,wardaniel9,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:58:47 2015 UTC,"drum rolls Find out next week or something, folks? (Your question will be answered soon)"
Haruhi,31diq7,synthwizard,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:05:48 2015 UTC,Recognize? As if she's looking for her? or as if she knows some girl named Haruhi exist?
Haruhi,31diq7,Poketoa,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:05:45 2015 UTC,"Really like the new character design, they fit this series a lot better than the old ones would have, also was very surprised by how different everyone act, but I think it a good thing as this should distinguish itself from the original anime...  So does Nagato AND Mikuru have a crush on kyon in this serie, I guess they did in the original as well.."
Haruhi,31diq7,jereddit,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:57:10 2015 UTC,No I think Tsuruya was just stirring up trouble.

Haruhi,31cjxa,deathowm,3,Fri Apr 3 20:27:00 2015 UTC,Is the manga worth buying then or is the anime enough moe?
Haruhi,31cjxa,Ra5han,3,Fri Apr 3 20:47:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know just how faithful the anime is/will be, but if you think you'll like it then we'll, it'll probably be worth it. I got the manga the same day, literally 5 minutes before I found out about the anime, over a year ago. It was worth it then , and I'm still buying the upcoming volumes now"
Haruhi,31cjxa,deathowm,3,Fri Apr 3 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"I do agree. Nagato looks very cute in the new series! I'm currently on volume 7 of the manga, and it is a blast."

Haruhi,31cjxa,Moonhowler22,3,Fri Apr 3 23:00:19 2015 UTC,Looks very nice. Cute. Can't wait.
Haruhi,31cjxa,arahag,3,Fri Apr 3 21:37:12 2015 UTC,Where can I watch it? I have a Funimation subscription.
Haruhi,31cjxa,Kafke,5,Fri Apr 3 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Right? I'm having trouble finding it anywhere. It's not on Funimation's site, it's not on Crunchyroll, it's not on Hulu...as it stands, there is a single torrent up, but it's a raw so no subs. Come on, Funi, gimme mah show!"
Haruhi,31cjxa,P-man,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:53:06 2015 UTC,Do those legal options usually have stuff subbed a day after the release? If so that's pretty impressive.
Haruhi,31cjxa,favsiteinthecitadel,4,Sat Apr 4 18:04:53 2015 UTC,"It's not all that impressive. Fan-Subs typically do it as well. And official/legal options typically get them a bit earlier so they can do the sub work.  IIRC, Crunchyroll airs them an hour after they air in Japan."
Haruhi,31cjxa,QuadrupleJMC,3,Sat Apr 4 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I like it. But the best way I can put it is if you just showed me the art work without context I'd assume it's fan-art of Haruhi. The fact this is a real studio-produced version; one side of me is saying why change it? ...but the other side of me is saying this still bodes well for more Haruhi since if kyoani see how well this does (& hopefully it will if the manga is anything to go on) then it might kick them in the ass as give us more vanilla Haruhi and a season 3.   closing opinion: it kinda reminds me of a mix between the art styles used in Haganai and Railgun/index. just me?"
Haruhi,31cjxa,favsiteinthecitadel,2,Sun Apr 5 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with you 100 percent. I really do hope that this series does well in japan. If it actually does well, then Kyoto animation will see an incentive to adapt more Haruhi content. Im kind of confused as to why they didn't pick this up though. Maybe they thought that people wouldn't really be interested in it?   Yeah, I see what you are saying. it sort of reminds me of White album 2 and railgun."
Haruhi,31cjxa,arahag,3,Sun Apr 5 23:23:22 2015 UTC,sucks that funimation are streaming this since i won't be able to watch it legally and i wanted to.
Haruhi,31cjxa,favsiteinthecitadel,8,Fri Apr 3 20:47:21 2015 UTC,It would really suck if funimation decided against hiring the old english dub actors.
Haruhi,31cjxa,DevoutHaruhiist,4,Fri Apr 3 23:48:59 2015 UTC,At least Kyon.  That VA nailed Kyon perfectly imo
Haruhi,31cjxa,arahag,3,Sat Apr 4 02:17:24 2015 UTC,agreed. though i would give the new dub a chance. its only fair.
Haruhi,31cjxa,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Sat Apr 4 09:22:33 2015 UTC,Crispin freeman was excellent as Kyon. I don't think any other voice actor would fit the role.
Haruhi,31cjxa,Kafke,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:16:54 2015 UTC,Does that mean other streaming sites won't have it because of copyright?
Haruhi,31cjxa,NoCountyForOldLAN,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:06:31 2015 UTC,looks like it.

Haruhi,31cjxa,NoCountyForOldLAN,3,Fri Apr 3 21:45:03 2015 UTC,Why is everyone who dislikes the art style getting downvoted? Isn't this a thread for people to discuss the art style? Just because you don't agree with someone's opinion doesn't mean you should downvote them.

Haruhi,31bv6r,Sonicfire25,3,Fri Apr 3 17:17:52 2015 UTC,It won't be up just yet as it just aired in Japan (literally no more than a couple hours ago) so you'll have to wait until it is fansubbed which might not be for another several hours.

Though with Funimation, you have to be paying their subscription service to see the episode as soon as it airs and it'll only become available to free users at a later point in time.   And will there be subtitles right from the start? They probably won't be able to dub it in time for the original broadcast, will they?   Of course there'll be subtitles. No use streaming a Japanese shows to English audiences without them. I doubt there'll be a broadcast dub as Funimation is located in Texas and Haruhi's Eng VAs are in L.A. so the time and money put into it would be a bit too much.

Haruhi,30c56z,ZeroCiipheR,6,Thu Mar 26 03:59:04 2015 UTC,"Good question.  The first time (ep 6) was probably like life and death. Although he first didn't completely believed everything his 3 club members told them, now it was all real. No one really knew what would have happened if he hadn't prevent that from happening. Maybe she would've created a totally different world without humans at all, only him and haruhi, not other known people around, not friends, not family. Or maybe nothing, the end. The lesson here was that this is all real, and was also kind of interesting.  The second time (movie) he had a choice. Live a totally normal and ""carefree"" life, without the responsibilities of taking care of Haruhi and the problems, and disregarding all moments he spent with them and Haruhi as if it was meaningless. He didn't want to runaway from the real life. Although it was troublesome, it was also fun and interesting. But also now he wants to take care of Nagato and help her be more human and less of a machine."
Haruhi,30c56z,SpaceOri,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:01:20 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Thank you for clearing this up :)
Haruhi,30c56z,Zinx10,3,Thu Mar 26 15:42:42 2015 UTC,"Similar to what SpaceOri said, in episode 6, there was no guarantee of what would happen.  It could have just been him and Haruhi or something else could have happened.  Either way, Haruhi is Haruhi.  That is the key point there: Haruhi will still be her usual Haruhi self, and he will be forced to live knowing that in the new reality.  In the movie, however, he had physical proof of what would have happened.  The world would have been ""normal.""  Not only that, but while Haruhi would keep her personality, she would not keep one of the most distinguishing qualities about her: her powers.  Basically, in the episode 6 choice, he had a choice if he would like to potentially redo life for better or for worse with Haruhi.  In the movie, he had the choice whether his life was better or worse without Haruhi.  While both appear as important decisions, the decisions themselves are vastly different.  One is about whether to live in a new world with Haruhi while the other is about whether to live in the same world but where Haruhi's unique abilities don't matter (AKA a ""normal"" life)."

Haruhi,302vr2,iKill_eu,2,Tue Mar 24 00:54:42 2015 UTC,"How the hell does final Kyon know that he has to go restore the timeline where he died to Alter-Asakura?   Because after he is saved, he knows that he eventually needs to go back. At some point. In then novels this is on the back of his mind and he puts it off for a while.  But he knows, because he recognizes his own voice.   there has to be a starting point in that timeline where no one rescued him, otherwise he wouldn't know that he had to go rescue himself to start the loop.   He knows to go back because he saved himself. This is a case of Novikov's Self-consistency principle.   Was there an iteration where he died and Asahina had to restart the entire loop and make him save himself so he could complete the cycle?   No, in the author's words (described in a later book), the timeline is modified by the reality warping powers.  Viewed as a classical model of time, we can see there's 3 timelines.   What we see in disappearance. Time goes, Yuki changes stuff, Kyon has problems and eventually goes back in time to change things. He ends up in 2. Kyon does stuff 3 years ago, and eventually ends up with past yuki. He then goes to terminate this reality shift. Fast-forward to 2's future. He attempts to revert things and gets shot. Kyon from 3 comes along and finishes up the change here. Had Kyon 3 not come, Kyon 2 would die. But that doesn't matter. this timeline doesn't have a future. Kyon's life is unaffected and he falls down some stairs. He's aware he needs to go back and trigger the events for 3 to over-write 2. He heads back at a later date to do this. He appears in 2, and converges 2's and 3's past into leading into the same future. They are alternate versions of the past that lead into the same future.   I think the book refers to these two alternate events as reality X and reality X'. But the idea is that the future alternate timeline affects the past main line, and converges the two.  As I said, it's a bit off and is hard to describe with typical 3 models of time travel (alternate lines, self-consistent line, changing line). It's more of alternate lines that are self-consistent and change. Sort of all three mixed ;P.  There's no ""looping"" or anything of that sort. Time 2 and Time 3 are interdependent after Kyon meddles with things.  Edit: Time 1/2 can be seen as a single self-consistent cycle.   Edit 2: To go into detail. Time 1/2 goes as normal (with bamboo leaf rhapsody and everything), until the point where yuki alters reality. At this point there's two alternate outcomes. The first is that she does so, and Kyon get's weirded out and goes back in time. He then fast forwards to this point to initiate the other outcome, in which he gets shot and future Kyon (from the already altered timeline) comes back and finishes the change. This changed event is disguised as Kyon falling down the stairs. He's then aware he needs to go back and does so, completing the self-consistency loop.  Or something like that."
Haruhi,302vr2,Kafke,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:14:20 2015 UTC,That sort of makes sense.... even if I'm still terribly confused about how the final (restored) timeline can possibly exist if there's no initial trigger for the bridge between the timeline where Kyon gets killed while trying to restore the timelines and the one where it has already been restored.
Haruhi,302vr2,Kafke,1 point,Tue Mar 24 09:23:48 2015 UTC,"Kyon doesn't die. At no point or in any timeline is Kyon dead. He gets shot, but he doesn't die. He doesn't die, because he's saved by future Kyon.  Future Kyon, when in that same situation, was also saved by Future Kyon.  A more classic way of putting it is Kyon went back in time and gave birth to himself. Most people would consider this a paradox (namely the grandfather paradox), but it's not, provided it follows Novikov's Self-Consistency principle. Which it does.  Kyon surviving isn't a changed event. It's just what happens. Always. Every time. By Future Kyon.  1: Kyon doesn't do anything and shit changes on him.  2: Kyon goes back in time, and then forward again to right before shit went down. He is shot.  3: Kyon from 4 arrives, fixes shit, and saves Kyon from 2. And returns back to 5.  4: Kyon (already saved and aware he needs to go back) decides now is the time and heads to 3.  5: Kyon from 4 returns to his present time.  That's Kyon's whole journey, more or less. Obviously, during 1, we can't have Kyon fixing things. Which means there's two versions of that event. One where it happens normally (no interference by the Kyons). And one where Kyon arrives and corrects things.    If you're still confused, I'll draw out a timeline for you tomorrow. Basically Yuki Succeeds and Yuki fails are two simultaneous events that both need to happen. technically this means there's two timelines (the book says it's just two alternate histories for the same timeline, and both are valid). In one timeline, Kyon doesn't realize what happened and goes through finding Haruhi and all that. He goes back in time and branches the line when jumping forward to correct it.  The second timeline loops back on itself, with future Kyon coming in and helping out (saving Kyon) and correcting the timeline. Kyon nearly dies but is saved by himself. He goes on with his life in the corrected world, and eventually decides to go back. He then goes back and plays it out as he remembers.  These self-consistency loops are actually quite common in haruhi. And are actually the premise of one of the books."
Haruhi,302vr2,PieDude24,2,Tue Mar 24 11:04:20 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Adult Asahina saw what happened and left to get a Kyon from a different time, and that also explains why you don't see Adult Asahina after Kyon gets stabbed until she shows up again with another Kyon."
Haruhi,302vr2,Kafke,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:16:03 2015 UTC,"Except he doesn't need to be 'gotten'. The Kyon that arrives is the one that was stabbed, just in the future. Future Kyon went through the exact same events as past Kyon. When he becomes future Kyon, he mentions how he wasn't sure if he got what he was supposed to say correct, but he figured it didn't really matter."
Haruhi,302vr2,PieDude24,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:24:17 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense. I'm not the best when it comes to understanding time travel theory and whatnot   (；⌣̀_⌣́)
Haruhi,302vr2,PieDude24,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:35:50 2015 UTC,"I think I might have explained it a bit too simply. Remember how Kyon says he is not really sure when he has to go to the future? I think that he eventually learns because Adult Asahina comes to him telling him that it is time. Though, why young Asahina was there still confuses me."
Haruhi,302vr2,Kafke,1 point,Tue Mar 24 02:40:24 2015 UTC,"I think that he eventually learns because Adult Asahina comes to him telling him that it is time. Though, why young Asahina was there still confuses me.   Nope. It's actually explained in the books. IIRC, there was some events that made Kyon a bit worried and he figured he might as well get it over with before it possibly causes problems. So he eventually brings it up to young Mikuru (IIRC).  That is: Past Kyon+Adult Mikuru arrive. Adult Mikuru already aware what's going to happen, because she experienced it as young Mikuru. Past Kyon attempts to fix everything and gets shot. Future Kyon + Young Mikuru had already arrived and watched this take place (not interfering yet on purpose). They then rush over, Mikuru - not knowing what was about to happen - rushed over to past Kyon (who thought it was strange, since he knew he was going to be fine) and Future Kyon takes care of things and recites the line he heard. Restored Yuki then fixes things. I forget what exactly happens next. But it's something along those lines. It's in the books.  Kyon's the one who initiates going back. And he's aware the entire time he needs to do so. He just didn't want to tell young Mikuru about it, but he needed to, since she was there."

Haruhi,2zx2zd,potato_dude,0,Mon Mar 23 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Mainly because if someone from that show is overrated it's Nagato, not Haruhi."
Haruhi,2zx2zd,asakura_ryouko,6,Mon Mar 23 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The whole point of Nagato's character was that she herself was underrated by everyone around her (Kyon in particular), just because she had no (displayable) emotions. Because, as it was said in the series, that's how she was programmed. Quiet and aloof bookworm, always just in the background. Someone Haruhi could definitely see being in the Literary Club. She WAS the ""behind the scenes"". The one (other than Koizumi and his Organization) cleaning up after Haruhi and protecting Kyon. She and her superiors have done THE most of the three factions and none of it is ever really appreciated.  She's arguably one of the, if not THE, best written characters in the series because her tragedy is that she is and always will be underrated."
Haruhi,2zx2zd,potato_dude,2,Mon Mar 23 04:09:25 2015 UTC,"And look at endless eight, so many people hated it because they didn't get it, it was about what Yuki does and goes through that no one appreciates."
Haruhi,2zx2zd,asakura_ryouko,1 point,Mon Mar 23 07:49:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly! We are given a taste of what Nagato had to go through that equates to probably less than a blink of an eye in comparison, and it was terrible. Most can safely say we never want to go through that again.   But even though we've seen some of what she goes through, we all still say""ahh, she's fine! Look at her. Same as always."".... But she's not. And we find that out later on as well. It's actually put into perspective what Yuki had to suffer through, and just because people don't like a girl who can't smile when she's happy or cry when she's sad, she's being called overrated... Heart breaking."

Haruhi,2ztsr8,GrayStandard,6,Sat Mar 21 19:35:44 2015 UTC,It's because a lot of people see Asahina-san as a stereotypical moe blob.
Haruhi,2ztsr8,Ra5han,3,Sat Mar 21 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"IMO Mikuru sucks as a character (besides older Mikuru). But her situation is fascinating. So I always get excited for a Mikuru story, but I can't stand her as a character."

After watching this PV though, it brought all that nostalgia back. I really love this franchise, and it really hurt to see it slowly become forgotten (though that is bound to happen with any series).

Haruhi,2zvjvh,Kafke,3,Sun Mar 22 16:27:43 2015 UTC,"To each his own, but I'll take the opposite side. I loved every minute of Endless Eight because it felt so jarring, which is exactly how you should be feeling in order to fully empathize with Nagato. Art shouldn't just convey happy feelings alone, it should convey the whole range of emotions in order to move the public. The fact that it wasn't even a lazy work is just icing on the cake.  As I said, your mileage might vary, but I'd personally recommend to take it all in and appreciate every minute detail, which is also how I'd recommend enjoying all the other KyoAni adaptations."
Haruhi,2zvjvh,DarkStar5758,2,Sun Mar 22 16:35:06 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the endless eight seeing as every episode I was yelling at my screen for Kyon to do something.
Haruhi,2zvjvh,DarkStar5758,3,Sun Mar 22 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it was great to find yourself feeling that desperation at the end of every episode. Other movies or shows seldom make me feel the way Endless Eight alone has; it's a real piece of work."
Haruhi,2zvjvh,Kafke,2,Sun Mar 22 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I enjoyed every minute. It's a build up and an interesting use of media that not many movies/tv shows play with.  So for that reason, I'd say do it. Simply because there's really no other way to get that experience, and spoiling it ruins it."
Haruhi,2zvjvh,sexydaniboy,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:52:45 2015 UTC,"Also, it seems that it goes by faster as you get closer to the end. The first episode seemed like a full episode but by then end it felt like 10 minutes. Maybe some day I'll go through the endless eight multiple times in a row so it is closer to what Yuki experienced. First episode followed by the middle six a few times and end on the last."

Haruhi,2znqus,fiqar,4,Fri Mar 20 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"Supposedly there's more coming. The guy is just really slow at releasing new ones.  IIRC there's at least 1 more (that's being worked on right now), and I think people mentioned that there needs to be a few more to wrap up all the plot points. But I wouldn't know about that (I'm not caught up yet).  Either way, Haruhi is still alive. But it's just moving at a snails pace."
Haruhi,2znqus,Kafke,7,Fri Mar 20 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"Either way, Haruhi is still alive. But it's just moving at a snails pace.   Maybe she's just trapped in a closed space :P"
Haruhi,2znqus,otakuman,2,Fri Mar 20 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, in the last novel he said something like ""I'm done for a while"". He hasn't publish anything in YEARS, but in theory there will be more at some point. The last books has a really nice ending that could be perfectly the closure to the series. I though it was for a long time until someone point out that it wasn't like that"
Haruhi,2znqus,Rein3,2,Fri Mar 20 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"According to the Observations of Haruhi Suzumiya, released in 2011, Surprise wasn't intended to be the last light novel in the series. In case you're curious, have a read through this page (shoutout to /u/ultimatemegax for the translation, dapper stuff) of the translation of an interview with Tanigawa after Surprise was released. As you can see, obviously they censored the content, but it seems like awesome stuff is going to happen :D  Based off of that, he clearly is planning for another light novel. It's certainly taking him a while; at the end of the interview, he says he's going to take his time and write it ""bit by bit"". But knowing that it is at least in the works is encouraging :) (also, if you read the whole interview, he mentions that he spends 80% thinking about mahjong nowadays... that would explain the drop in productivity).  He ""recently"" wrote a Haruhi related short story (again, thanks /u/ultimatemegax for this) called ""Random Numbers"" for Haruhi Hyakka, which was an artbook released in 2013.   So I think it's pretty safe to say that despite the time it's taking (4 years and counting), Tanigawa still has Haruhi on the mind and is evidently working on an upcoming light novel. All we can do is wait (and watch the Disappearance of Yuki-chan, starting April 3rd! We might even get a leak of the first episode as early as March 22nd)."
Haruhi,2znqus,sleepycomputer,2,Fri Mar 20 19:10:18 2015 UTC,"There was 4 years between Dissociation and Surprise, just be patient and it'll come along eventually.  I just realized I've been waiting for The Winds of Winter by George RR Martin for just barely a month less than the next Haruhi LN and he's infamous for taking forever. At least the next volume of Disappearence of Nagato Yuki-chan comes out on Tuesday."

Haruhi,2zkfsu,8works,2,Thu Mar 19 08:57:43 2015 UTC,"There's 6 different ways of watching the series, actually.  1/2 = Subbed Chronological/Air-order  3/4 = Dubbed Chrono/Air  5/6 = Subbed/Dubbed Book order  Book order has never been officially released, and relatedly most people don't watch it like that. Pretty much no one, actually.  As for the other 4 options, that's all depending on preference. I'm not a fan of the air order, as it only encapsulates season 1, with you having to figure out what to do with season 2 (most people tack it onto the end). I'm a fan of the chronological order, which is similar to the books themselves.  My original watch was S1 in chronological order, then S2 in chronological order. Which was weird, and I don't suggest it.  Then you have the sub/dub question. And it really boils down to whether you like Kyon's english voice, or Haruhi's japanese voice. Personally, I can't stand Kyon's japanese voice. And Crispin Freeman does an excellent job as Kyon. So I refuse to watch it subbed.  Making my personal choice: Dubbed Chronological."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,Kafke,1 point,Thu Mar 19 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I like the original Japanese dub, might just be me who doesn't hate any of their voices. I've seen the first episode in dub and sub and I like them both.   Thanks again."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,Kafke,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:26:45 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's all just preference. The Japanese VAs are all fantastic. IMO it's a matter of fit. Haruhi is a bit off in the english, while Kyon is pretty off in the japanese. Just my 2c.  I'd also recommend doing a comparison when the other characters come in as well. But really, either way works. I'm comfortable watching it however a newbie wants to see it. I just much prefer the eng dub.  Getting used to the Japanese voices might be best if you are interested in watching the Yuki-chan anime when it airs, as it's all going to be the same cast."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,autowikiabot,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:43:54 2015 UTC,Alright then. I'll go with English dub then as I don't want to risk hating a character's voice.   So chronological order as in this order?  http://haruhi.wikia.com/wiki/The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_(anime)

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱 Suzumiya Haruhi no Yūutsu), directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, follows the high school life of Haruhi Suzumiya, a young and very eccentric high school girl and her SOS Brigade. Although Haruhi is the central character, the story is told from Kyon's point of view. In the SOS Brigade, Haruhi managed to gather together Kyon, Yuki Nagato (an alien), Mikuru Asahina (a time traveler), and Itsuki Koizumi (an esper), respectively. Nagato, Asahina, and Koizumi are supernatural beings sent on a mission to watch over Haruhi to keep her from destroying the world and creating a new one by accident.

Haruhi,2zkfsu,appropriate-username,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:21:57 2015 UTC,"I'll go with English dub then as I don't want to risk hating a character's voice.   Lol, other way around. Dub is my preference. Japanese are going to be what you are watching when Yuki-chan airs.  I just meant to check out whatever you aren't watching when a new character pops up. Simply because they aren't all in the first episode.  Do Sub, and then see dub when a character comes in. Or, if you like the dub, do dub and check out sub when a new character comes in.   So chronological order as in this order?   Yup. You can also find both orders (by episode title) here.  Either way, watch in chronological order, on whatever voices you like better. The biggest factor is generally Kyon/Haruhi, but the other characters sound quite different as well. Just keep in mind that Yuki-chan isn't going to be dubbed immediately, so if you are going to watch it, it'll be the Japanese voice actors.  Personally I like the eng dub. But the Japanese voices are good too. It's all preference.  Edit: I find Haruhi is one of those series that dual audio files are something you'd be glad to have."

Haruhi,2zkfsu,Kafke,2,Fri Mar 20 02:40:43 2015 UTC,"I don't mind Kyon's Japanese voice, I like hearing the original untranslated script and I think Haruhi's English voice is annoying   As I said, it's mostly a matter of which you like better: Kyon english or haruhi japanese. The other voices are supplementary to that decision. I like pretty much all of the english voices, with the exception of Mikuru (who sounds better in literally every other language). In the Japanese, I can't stand Kyon at all, but the rest are fine.  Just a matter of preference. I don't think anyone is actually saying one is superior. Unless, of course, you are one of those people who religiously hate on dubs."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,appropriate-username,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't mean my views were superior, just wanted to share them. That said, I do tend to seek out subs over dubs first because I tend to like the VAs more, with the sole exception of Naruto."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,Kafke,2,Fri Mar 20 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't mean my views were superior, just wanted to share them.   No worries. I tried to make that clear in my original comment. There's pretty much people all over the board when it comes to 'how to watch haruhi'. Some people like the subs (they are still excellent), and some people like the dub.   That said, I do tend to seek out subs over dubs first because I tend to like the VAs more, with the sole exception of Naruto.   Lol. I generally take it on a case-by-case. My natural inclination is to check out the dub if there is one, since that's how I was introduced to anime (with Naruto, Bleach, Pokemon, Please Teacher, Full Metal Alchemist, etc). And there really are some good dubs (like Baccano, Death Note is alright, Haruhi is excellent, etc). Just depends on what you are into. I've seen some bad dubs as well. So hopefully I'm not seen as preaching dubs :P"
Haruhi,2zkfsu,appropriate-username,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:20:23 2015 UTC,What's the worst dub you've heard?
Haruhi,2zkfsu,Kafke,2,Fri Mar 20 03:21:20 2015 UTC,"Ever? That honor goes to Chaos Wars. I don't think that's an anime though. One more clip for the lulz. I honestly think they just grabbed relatives to do the voices.  For anime... The Wallflower wasn't really that great as a dub (though I still watched/enjoyed). Say I love you had some pretty bad dub voices (though there's one or two I liked). Mirai Nikki sounds fine, but the voices I don't think fit. And I just noped out of steins;gate which is easily one of my favorite anime. Perhaps those last two aren't all that bad, but in a similar regard to Japanese Kyon, it just doesn't fit (even if it sounds fine).  Though honestly, for Wallflower/Say I love you, I'm probably going to stick with the crappy dubs. I watched them dub for a reason (even after I realized they sucked and I had the dual audio), and I'm gonna rewatch them the same way. But I fully acknowledge the actual dubs themselves suck.  Oh, and various pornographic anime as well have awful awful awful dubs. But I'm not going to link them, and I'm not familiar with the titles (they come up as random dubbed clips).  Also worth noting that I'm fond of Lucky Star's Dub (due to same actors as Haurhi), and I like K-On's dub, but I dislike the style it was done. They were awful at making it flow and it sounds like a weird combo of Japanese manners of speaking with english voices/speech. It just comes out really weird, and there's a joke in the OVA that doesn't translate correctly (similar to Steins;Gate, actually).  Gurren Lagann is another one. I started it dubbed, and thought it was mediocre (both the show and the dub). And I was going to drop it, but was encouraged to continue, but in subbed. So I did, and I liked the voices much better there as well, and my opinions on that one are kind of weird.  Lots of old anime dubs really suck. The newer ones actually aren't all that bad, but sometimes have 'fitting' issues. For Haruhi, the fit issue I see is Mikuru. The rest of the characters are fine. In the Japanese the fit issue is Kyon (IMO). All the rest sound fine in Japanese."
Haruhi,2zkfsu,iKill_eu,0,Fri Mar 20 03:40:06 2015 UTC,"Hah, Chaos Wars is amazing. I liked the say I love you dub though. Also, lol@kurisu's voice. Thanks for the entertainment :)"

I've been rewatching the series in preparation for Yuki-Chan this spring (hype!) and came across this. I was pretty surprised I hadn't seen it, maybe it's better known than I thought."

Haruhi,2zax9a,otakuman,4,Tue Mar 17 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm writing a novel about an android with feelings but no free will. From her point of view, it's extremely frustrating that you can't act upon your own desires. Furthermore, if those desires only appear intermitently, then you lack the motivation to act upon what you've already felt.  Imagine you need to write a very important letter, but you're feeling extremely exhausted, lazy, or depressed. You try to concentrate to write the letter, but just can't. So you try to play games or get in a better mood, and then you realize you didn't write the letter. You feel guilty about it, but still, you are unable to write that letter. Your brain is outside your own control. You want to do something, but you can't want it strongly enough. Then, you get depressed because you didn't do it.  ""My mission is just to observe.""  Nagato knows that she can't ask Kyon to help her. She is even forbidden from expressing her suffering. But she also knows she can't lie. So when Kyon asks her, she only stares at him.  ""...""  As if hoping, wishing, that he will interpret that silence correctly.  Nagato knows what she would prefer, because she has a limited capability for feeling. She is just unable to feel fear, or other human emotions. She can express that she fears something, because she wouldn't like that happening. Because her emotions are restricted.  And yet, she would like to feel those emotions if she had them.  ""She would like"". A theoretical analysis. If event A happened, she would indeed be glad that A happened. Or maybe she would find it convenient. That is the limited capability of humanoid interfaces, isn't it? The fact that she cannot smile like Asakura or Kimidori-san doesn't change anything. It's their free will that is restricted.   Asakura disobeyed because she went berserk. She broke her program and disobeyed Nagato's orders to be just a back up, just as Nagato disobeyed orders on December 18. But normally, Nagato is not in berserk mode. She is under control.  She says she would like, or she would prefer, as if merely stating a fact. A simple semantic change from ""would like"" to ""want"" would be obvious for humans, but it's a line she cannot cross.  Until December 18, when she crossed the line, and hoped she wouldn't cross it back."

(at least most of us) we were likely influenced at a young age due to something like the ace attorney games or something like a sibling who was into what was popular at the times. (my older brothers are huge Naruto and DBZ fans)  folks like my friend and tons of people on reddit are just people who are really new to the things they experience. so they go like all out and make those things seem like they're super good. (/r/atheism is one of the worst subs for this very reason)  i don't know if any of this has actual meaning or im just spouting bs but whatever. TL;DR new people are into new things and people like us are likely old fans"
Haruhi,2z6tf7,DarkStar5758,3,Mon Mar 16 03:31:52 2015 UTC,"And then there's the people that claim they know anime but can't name anything older than 3 years besides DBZ, Pokemon, and Naruto. My friend is the president of our school's anime club and he showed Ouran Host Club, whose main character is also named Haruhi. I sent him this and the next day he said he had no idea who it was. He also hadn't heard of Cowboy Bebop until last year and Mirai Nikki until last month. There's probably others but I don't want to undermine his leadership of his club until after the end of the school year."

Haruhi,2z6tf7,Kafke,2,Mon Mar 16 09:43:54 2015 UTC,"Your point is certainly true, but if you look at some of the things that ARE nominated, it doesn't really hold up in this context. Classic Series that are widely regarded, the New Favorites of people new to anime, and Obscure things, good or trash, are among the over 200 contestants. If Haruhi was eliminated early in the competition, what you are saying would explain it, or if obscure anime and Classics even older that Haruhi (which can almost be considered a classic itself at this point) we absent from the competitors. That isn't the case though. In any of the contests that Haruhi is conspicuously absent from."

Haruhi,2z6tf7,Kafke,10,Mon Mar 23 09:02:36 2015 UTC,"It wins by default. The ""Best Anime of All Time"" competition is really the ""Second Best Anime of All Time"".  But the real answer is that Haruhi has been off the radar for quite some time now. There's lots of other popular anime, and with the influx of new viewers, it's been largely forgotten."
Haruhi,2z6tf7,Kafke,2,Mon Mar 16 04:37:29 2015 UTC,it's been largely forgotten   Just like half of these other things on the balot?
Haruhi,2z6tf7,PM_ME_MONEY_PLEASE,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"Could you give a link? I can't imagine it was specifically excluded. And if the list was just written by some random anime viewer, it's very likely that it was just forgotten/ignored.  What kind of things are on there that you would say are forgotten? I'd honestly be surprised if something like Major was on there, but Haruhi isn't.  I'm guessing most of it is probably just shows from the last few seasons or so."

It's the main bracket that R/Anime is promoting right now, and it is very extensive, so it's unlikely that some random anime veiwer. Keep in mind that this is only 1 out of 8 pages, and that you can scroll to the right for the other half of bracket A. As you can see it has likely over 200 contestants. I haven't even heard of half the stuff on this list. Granted, I'm not some guru who knows every or even most anime, but I'm certainly not unlearned."
Haruhi,2z6tf7,sleepycomputer,3,Mon Mar 16 04:58:55 2015 UTC,"Huh. Just looking through the list, most of it is pretty popular stuff, as expected. But then there's just some weird choices in there. My guess? All the anime in there was grabbed by a script, possibly just a list of titles mentioned on /r/anime. Seeing as some of the names use an uncommon name (either using the japanese when english is preferred or vice versa). And then there's just some anime that is baffling on why it'd be on a popularity poll.  But you are right. Haruhi should definitely be on there. Considering it's more popular than quite a bit of stuff on there."
Haruhi,2z6tf7,Thehoennhippo,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:35:30 2015 UTC,I'll have to ask on /r/Anime how exactly the contestants were picked then if that's the case. I should have done that to begin with to be honest.

Haruhi,2z6ery,aehlius,3,Mon Mar 16 00:02:29 2015 UTC,"The last solo part with the same 3 notes repeating is a bit tricky to get spot on, so i just go for ""close enough"". The part before that i just do some A lydian shenanigans (The original version uses some A# in there as well though) until the bit on the e string, just before the jimmy style 2 note bend right before the solo, which is the really recognizable part imo. You have to play with some backing track in A for it all to sound right.  I play it on a strat w/ single coils but i guess on a LP i'd go for bridge pickup and high mids/high, maybe ? Don't know too much about that."
Haruhi,2z6ery,YogurtBatmanSwag,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:56:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, Yogurt! Thanks for reply! Never thought about the first part as an A lydian, definitely makes more sense now! The bends are pretty straightforward, but the 3 note, as you mentioned, are what bother me a lot. I'll try to play it with the instrumental, maybe that'll help.  Using bridge on LP does make it somewhat close, but I'm still a long way from Yuki's sound :c Thanks again for your input, it really helped with the first part of the solo! c:"

In Nagato Yuki-chan, he does not, in other words, the world becomes completely normal, including Kyon"
Haruhi,2ywu6n,deathowm,1 point,Fri Mar 13 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"According to what I remember, the show takes place during the Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu time, when they are in an alternate universe."

Haruhi,2ywu6n,mwzzhang,2,Fri Mar 13 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"There is no button pressing scene.  Everyone is perfectly 'normal' (well, as normal as any other people) human.  SOS brigade doesn't exist.  Asakura Ryouko is scary, but not knife-wielding nut.  Nagato Yuki almost went full otaku.  Kyon is less bitter because Haruhi isn't around.  Asahina Mikuru is still in Calligraphy club.  Tsuruya-san is more annoying. Pimping out Mikuru Forcing people to join ""Asahina Mikuru fan club"" on a daily basis.  Suzumiya Haruhi... Well watch the show or read the manga... Spoiler alert.  Koizumi Itsuki is... in the school downhill (whose name escapes me atm) kissing a certain person's ass (figuratively speaking, of course).  Mori Sonou (the maid) is a teacher in North High.  Taniguchi is a jackass as usual.  Who else did I miss...."
Haruhi,2ywu6n,Kafke,2,Fri Mar 13 19:01:51 2015 UTC,Mori Sonou (the maid) is a teacher in North High.   wat.
Haruhi,2ywu6n,mwzzhang,2,Fri Mar 13 23:57:54 2015 UTC,obviously not dressed like a maid (-_-)
Haruhi,2ywu6n,Ergoemos,2,Sat Mar 14 00:14:50 2015 UTC,"This is pretty accurate. Plot wise, the story sort of evolves as if Kyon was going to North High like he does in the first episode of the original show, but Haruhi (going to Kouyouen) isn't around to form the SOS club, but instead he sort of ends up hanging around the literature club with Yuki and Ryoko a lot, as the rest of the cast slowly joins for shenanigans.  I agree with your assessment, where Tsuruya becomes way more pushy (almost filling Haruhi's shoes), Ryoko stands out an interesting character in the story. She kind of steals it in the spotlight in depth of personality at times from my impression.  (if I need to spoiler any of this, just give me a heads up)"
Haruhi,2ywu6n,xxninjatacoxx,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"It's completely different, I believe. I suppose think of it as a completely separate show to TMoHS with only the characters taken from it, the 2 plots don't have anything to do with each other."
Haruhi,2ywu6n,DarkStar5758,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:16:11 2015 UTC,It is a slightly different timeline. There's no indication as to whether it's just a different timeline or if it's the same as the movie with Kyon not remembering the old world. The plot of the movie never happens but there are tons of references to the main series and all the characters are back including a few new ones.
Haruhi,2ywu6n,Kafke,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"Think that timeline, but without the regular Kyon entering it.   Does kyon not push the button and everything stays the same?   That's the basis/idea, but that particular event doesn't happen. It's just 'that universe', but with none of the movie's events taking place.   Can Kyon even remember the ""real"" timeline?   From my understanding, no. Since it's not actually intertwined like the movie. It's just a spin-off involving that general set-up.   And if not, how do they meet up with haruhi?   That'd be spoilers :P. But I hear she doesn't really play a big part in this spin-off. So... perhaps it's just by chance?"

Haruhi,2ykwll,Imosa1,3,Tue Mar 10 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"The fourth episode of Sigh will always stand as of the best in my book. Haruhi not only getting called out for her shit, and also realizing it was shit...  To put it into perspective, here is how it'd might have looked from Haruhi's perspective (By /u/muphrid15 )   You see, I once did something so terrible, Kyon would've punched me in the face if he hadn't been restrained.   Actually, I'd be surprised if that were the only time he felt that way. It's frightening how you can be so blind to the things you do and why, how you don't realize how someone else really sees you until you do something to push him to his limit. When you do, it all comes out so fast, in a fashion beyond anyone's control. Those feelings don't just come into being spontaneously, right? They build and build over time. When someone you trust feels there's no choice but to strike you to make you listen—even when that's only said or done in the heat of the moment—you know you've been doing something wrong. Or you should. If you don't, then you're just willfully blind.  I wanted to make this movie, right? I wanted to make a movie that wasn't like other movies. I cast Mikuru-chan as a battle waitress from the future, who by day masquerades as a bunny girl at the shopping arcade. I set her up with Koizumi-kun as a couple in the movie, and to shoot a steamy scene between them, I had Tsuruya-san—whose house we were using—spike Mikuru-chan's drink with tequila. That much only made Kyon, who was filming, step out from behind the camera and put a stop to my plan. If I'd let it go at that point, I could've come out with at least a hint of dignity or a shred of gained wisdom, but I didn't. I noticed Mikuru-chan still had this colored contact in from earlier, and I thought the best way to get it out would be to have it pop from her eye…  By hitting her on the back of her head with a megaphone.  For all that, Kyon was incredibly restrained at first. He caught my arm and stopped me. He stated flatly how stupid it was, that Mikuru-chan wasn't my toy to play with.  And I stubbornly declared that she was.  I don't know what was more surreal about that moment—that I expected him to back down then or that Koizumi-kun caught Kyon's balled fist before he could strike me.   I could've taken it better. No, actually, let's not sugarcoat it: I didn't take it well at all. I'd seldom seen Kyon angry—never to the point of violence, at least—but Mikuru-chan begged us not to fight. If she hadn't, I'm sure I would've done something colossally stupid—well, even more than I'd already done. I was still steamed when I got home that evening, and I thought I'd prove, somehow, that I was the one being reasonable, that because contacts really do fall out of your eyes if you're hit or jarred, somehow everything I'd done was right! And they could fall out like that!  When they were made of plexiglass.  Slowly, I started to reconsider, started to doubt. It wasn't a quick process; I was still stubborn and thick in the worst ways, after all. If I could be wrong about something so simple, I should take a hard look at everything, right? When I dressed Mikuru-chan in those outfits, was I thinking of how she'd look on camera, or was I thinking of how the cameraman was watching her instead? When I put her in a room with Koizumi-kun and demanded that they kiss, did I do that for the sake of a movie? Or to needle the guy who wouldn't be in the scene? That's not the fault of love or attraction, either. When he said Mikuru-chan wasn't my toy to play with, why did I push back? Because he challenged my authority? Or because I thought that meant he wanted her for himself?  That's what I've never let myself forget. Everyone in the brigade knows what I did that to Mikuru-chan that day—how I struck her, how I abused her. What they don't know, what I never had the courage to tell them, was how I turned our whole movie into a sham, an excuse to humiliate Mikuru-chan in front of Kyon. Just realizing that made me feel sick inside, but that wasn't the end of it. Kyon must've realized what I was doing, too, and if he'd been angry enough to strike me, he surely had no reason to stick around.  So I went to school the next day, and I steeled myself. I deserved whatever Kyon had to say to me. That much I wouldn't argue, but Kyon had my heart and the fate of the brigade in his hands. He could've easily crushed them both and said they were bad or ill-conceived. Much better to start over, to wipe away those horrors and begin anew.  When Kyon found me in the club room at lunch that day, I thought he'd say he was leaving the brigade, that it'd be the last time we spoke as friends. Instead, he told me the last thing I expected to hear.  Kyon forgave me that day.   He forgave me when he didn't have to. Like I said, I expected the worst—the harshest condemnation, the most intense rebuke. Every so often, I'd play through that conversation the way I thought it would happen, as a reminder that no friendship is totally solid.  Especially if you give the other party every reason to break it.  All in all, the movie turned out all right. At least, that's what I'd thought before I learned I started making a cat speak like a philosopher. That's a story in itself; it's not important. I'd like to say I learned my lesson from that time, but if I truly had, I wouldn't have doubted a friend for even an instant. And I knew that, too."

Haruhi,2ykwll,1tobedoneX,1 point,Wed Mar 11 02:39:32 2015 UTC,"Does that notion really make sense, when you consider that the universe responds to what Haruhi wants. If Middle School Haruhi wanted to search for Aliens, Time Travelers, and Espers then the world could have accommodated this. In fact, the world could even accommodate for her meeting a person who plays the same role in her life that Kyon plays for her now."
Haruhi,2ykwll,Ergoemos,2,Wed Mar 11 02:59:54 2015 UTC,I really have no idea about that...
Haruhi,2ykwll,Kafke,2,Wed Mar 11 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"That's one of those interesting concepts of Haruhi Suzumiya and it's philosophy that never really gets covered. You are hitting on the sort of questions that I usually ask myself privately as well.   Is Kyon just another construct of Haruhi's powers? It is technically possible, making all of the SOS Brigade members just psychic imprints given personality and intent for Haruhi to interact with and create the narrative she desires. I could see this happening, as Kyon really does represent everything grounded and realistic that Haruhi herself doesn't usually show. He's even claimed to be Haruhi's Conscience at one point by Koizumi.   Do I subscribe to this theory that Kyon is another manufactured trope (the unfazed everyman) to play out Haruhi's secret desires to be the protagonist in crazy shenanigans? Nah, though were I the right kind of writer, I'd like to see that plot slowly unfold.   Its sort of like the speculation that Kyon himself might actually be the ""omnipotent"" being, where Haruhi is the person who seems to have all the power because he is too jaded to believe he could be the one with all the abilities. It's food for thought, interesting, but doesn't really go anywhere, other than trying to provide Kyon more agency, and Haruhi less.   As to your original question, ""Why does it take until high school to start the SOS Brigade?""    I sort of have to assume this is because Haruhi isn't actually All-Powerful and All-Knowing, which is sort of supported in the story, and as you mention, she is sort of programmable. Haruhi thinks to create a baseball team because she saw a poster for a tournament. She decides to make a movie because she saw a terrible one on the television. So Haruhi doesn't make her own club until an outside source (assuming Kyon is truly an Outside Force) suggests it.   I would love to see your Moloch vs. Haruhi episode. I agree it would fit in perfectly."
Haruhi,2ykwll,Ergoemos,1 point,Wed Mar 11 09:59:56 2015 UTC,"That's one of those interesting concepts of Haruhi Suzumiya and it's philosophy that never really gets covered   Yes it does. 3 times. Once in the anime series. Once in the movie. And once in the novels. It's very thoroughly covered and is, IMO, the center-piece of the series.   It's food for thought, interesting, but doesn't really go anywhere, other than trying to provide Kyon more agency, and Haruhi less.   Personally, I think Kyon's a slider who doesn't realize this. And there's quite a few points that point to this. Particularly emphasis later on in the novels, along with Tsuruya's 'hints'. Though I'm told I'm wrong about this, so perhaps I should read the last few novels...   I sort of have to assume this is because Haruhi isn't actually All-Powerful and All-Knowing, which is sort of supported in the story, and as you mention, she is sort of programmable.   Well, she only changes things to how she knows it. She doesn't actually believe all that wacky stuff until the Kyon speech 3 years ago. Which is the catalyst for everything.   Haruhi doesn't make her own club until an outside source (assuming Kyon is truly an Outside Force) suggests it.   Yup. It's been touched on time and time again that ""Kyon can influence Haruhi's powers"". Though pretty subtly."
Haruhi,2ykwll,Kafke,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yes it does. 3 times. Once in the anime series. Once in the movie. And once in the novels. It's very thoroughly covered and is, IMO, the center-piece of the series.   Ha, maybe I should clarify. When I said ""the concept that is not covered"" is the idea that Kyon is just another creation of Haruhi's mind. I might have missed direct, absolute remarks to the fact, but there isn't really any discussion about the fact that Kyon might, in fact, just be as much a narrative character for Haruhi's mental stories as any of the other club members. (I will admit that both Koizumi and Yuki specifically state that Kyon is an ordinary human being, but they are not reliable narrators of fact on this matter).   Personally, I think Kyon's a slider who doesn't realize this. And there's quite a few points that point to this.    Possible, its definitely not the impression I got and I have read all the novels. Sounds like a good fanfiction if played right though and I don't see any reason to outright deny the possibility.   Well, she only changes things to how she knows it. She doesn't actually believe all that wacky stuff until the Kyon speech 3 years ago. Which is the catalyst for everything.   Hm, I am not sure I buy that her power is limited to concepts that she alone believes and knows. Yuki and her alien cohorts are, by her very intent (not necessarily her understanding) inscrutable and absolutely foreign in concept to humanity as a whole. These aliens had to create replicas of humans just to initiate contact. I usually imagine that her power is more related to her personal confidence in a concept and personal desire, not in outright belief, and the universe adapts. She doesn't believe Yuki is an alien, she doesn't believe Koizumi is an Esper and she doesn't believe that Mikuru is a time-traveler. But she is confident that Aliens, Time-Travelers, and Espers exist, and she is confident she wants to hang out with them and the universe oblidges. (this is totally a personal interpretation, of course, I don't mean to refute any one else's thoughts or be rude!)   Yup. It's been touched on time and time again that ""Kyon can influence Haruhi's powers"". Though pretty subtly.   Well, baseball flyers and bad movies are also good ways to petition your friendly local maybe-deity. Your results may vary though."
Haruhi,2ykwll,Ergoemos,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"is the idea that Kyon is just another creation of Haruhi's mind.    Ah. But Koizumi/Mikuru/Yuki aren't really creations of her mind in that sense either. Koizumi at least has been around and just 'happened' to get his powers. He wasn't created.   I might have missed direct, absolute remarks to the fact, but there isn't really any discussion about the fact that Kyon might, in fact, just be as much a narrative character for Haruhi's mental stories as any of the other club members.   There's a lot of hints, particularly in the novels (not so much the anime) that Kyon is 'special'. As well as Tsuruya in an apparently similar regard. This is hinted at a couple times. And certainly Kyon seems to be a key player, perhaps not because of Haruhi, but of other related manners.   (I will admit that both Koizumi and Yuki specifically state that Kyon is an ordinary human being, but they are not reliable narrators of fact on this matter).   Koizumi admits it himself that he can't actually tell. And he's going off what he 'knows', which isn't much, at least compared to Yuki. And Yuki has a stake in keeping things the way they are, and although Kyon says she's the most trustworthy, she admits that Kyon can't fully trust her.   Possible, its definitely not the impression I got and I have read all the novels. Sounds like a good fanfiction if played right though and I don't see any reason to outright deny the possibility.   I've read all but the last two or so (maybe 3). And that's the impression I'm getting. Perhaps something happens in those last couple novels that completely debunks this? Because to me, that looks like exactly what's happening. Kyon is unaware of his powers and flip-flops between alternate timelines/universes, to adjust critical moments in time. Which is why all the characters turn to him to 'fix' things.  It's just something I keep in mind as I read, since more and more it seems Kyon has some unknown power. More recently in the novels (that I was reading) there was a Time Traveler dude who said he was 'like Kyon' and then messed something up. So perhaps not quite a slider, but functionally acts like one. Just my 2c. I haven't finished reading, so this might not be the case at all.   Hm, I am not sure I buy that her power is limited to concepts that she alone believes and knows.   IIRC, that was the explanation for why everything happened 'three years ago'. Was because Kyon went back in time and planted the seed. And it's why they don't want to let Haruhi know about her powers. Koizumi specifically mentions this in one episode. Saying that, she believes there's Espers and such, but if she saw one or knew for a fact of their existence, they'd be everywhere, rather than in the shadows hidden away. Which implies it's based on what she personally knows/believes.  But again, Koizumi could be an unreliable narrator in this case.   I usually imagine that her power is more related to her personal confidence in a concept and personal desire, not in outright belief, and the universe adapts.    Perhaps.   She doesn't believe Yuki is an alien, she doesn't believe Koizumi is an Esper and she doesn't believe that Mikuru is a time-traveler. But she is confident that Aliens, Time-Travelers, and Espers exist, and she is confident she wants to hang out with them and the universe oblidges.   I'm pretty sure she sees them that way, but acknowledges those things don't really exist. This is evidenced by two things. First, when she assigns roles, she picks the exact ones for each person. And when Kyon speaks about them being aliens/time travelers/espers, she just laughs and tells him not to be ridiculous. Yet, the whole reason she grabbed Koizumi was because ""he's a mysterious transfer student"". Conflict of interest?  She also seems to ignore the various supernatural powers given to Mikuru, like the huge water blast thing from the gun.   Well, baseball flyers and bad movies are also good ways to petition your friendly local maybe-deity. Your results may vary though.   Well I meant Kyon is pretty much the only person who can change Haruhi's mind about something."
Haruhi,2ykwll,Kafke,1 point,Thu Mar 12 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Ah. But Koizumi/Mikuru/Yuki aren't really creations of her mind in that sense either. Koizumi at least has been around and just 'happened' to get his powers. He wasn't created.   Fair point, though I'd argue that we probably know the least about Koizumi than we know about any of the cast. There is no proof that his memories predating three years ago are real. (Personal note, I completely agree with you on this, I was trying to take the original posited idea to some sort of completion, not arguing its validity)   There's a lot of hints, particularly in the novels (not so much the anime) that Kyon is 'special'. As well as Tsuruya in an apparently similar regard. This is hinted at a couple times. And certainly Kyon seems to be a key player, perhaps not because of Haruhi, but of other related manners.   Hahaha, I believe that Tsuruya's words to that effect were something along the lines of ""You smell the same as I do."" which could just mean that she is a particularly perceptive, but ultimately a completely normal human being. That's my canon interpretation, and Kyon is 'special' for his relative freedom from being tied directly to a quasi-deity. Now, for my AU interpretation... that a completely different story.    More recently in the novels (that I was reading) there was a Time Traveler dude who said he was 'like Kyon' and then messed something up.    Dunno. I don't deny your interpretation in the least, but it also could be that the 'dude' was saying he used to be a normal person until he started screwing around with time directly too?   This is one of the things I love about this series, that there is just so much ambiguity and truths and lies and philosophy and literature theory that just about any interpretation is potentially valid.   Koizumi specifically mentions this in one episode. Saying that, she believes there's Espers and such, but if she saw one or knew for a fact of their existence, they'd be everywhere, rather than in the shadows hidden away.   Well, yeah, he also says everything he says is just a theory, and that there are factions within his Agency that want to tell Haruhi everything. I love Koizumi's character, but I trust him as a source of information only when he shows his more emotional self, rather than generally overall. That's who he is.   Well I meant Kyon is pretty much the only person who can change Haruhi's mind about something.   He's certainly the only one who has tried to do so directly. The other three don't try to be nearly so direct, with Mikuru's skulduggery causality, Koizumi's psychic assaults, and Yuki's Spoiler"
Haruhi,2ykwll,Kafke,2,Fri Mar 13 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"There is no proof that his memories predating three years ago are real. (Personal note, I completely agree with you on this, I was trying to take the original posited idea to some sort of completion, not arguing its validity)   We could say the same about Haruhi and Kyon as well. I think they actually address this in the anime as well. Saying something about how Haruhi could've actually have recreated the world several times now, and they wouldn't even know.   Hahaha, I believe that Tsuruya's words to that effect were something along the lines of ""You smell the same as I do."" which could just mean that she is a particularly perceptive, but ultimately a completely normal human being.   Same 'ability' to sniff out supernaturals? Makes sense. I have to admit, it's the Tsuruya fanboy in me that want's to read more into this. Though I'm fairly certain she's more involved than what initially meets the eye. Since she doesn't even think twice or question about the two Mikurus. Again, there might be more here that's expanded on in the later books.   That's my canon interpretation, and Kyon is 'special' for his relative freedom from being tied directly to a quasi-deity.   Makes sense. As I said though, it just seems there's hints thrown all around the place about Kyon. The last bit that I read in the novels really has me wtf-ing. Perhaps my thoughts will change when I catch up.   Dunno. I don't deny your interpretation in the least, but it also could be that the 'dude' was saying he used to be a normal person until he started screwing around with time directly too?   Nah, it sounds more like there's a specific series of events in which Kyon has direct control over (much like the decision to go back to the disappearance arc to wrap that up). I forget the exact context/quote, but it sounded like the guy was pretty much in Kyon's position until he messed something up. Which when I was reading my initial thought was ""that guy's future Kyon"", which I later realized probably isn't the case.  Either way, all my thoughts should be taken with a heavy dosage of salt. Seeing as I'm not caught up yet, and there's still quite a bit you could probably point to and say ""well this isn't the case because of this part you haven't read yet.""  Just my musings and thoughts while I work my way through the series.   This is one of the things I love about this series, that there is just so much ambiguity and truths and lies and philosophy and literature theory that just about any interpretation is potentially valid.   Definitely. I really enjoy reading the author's notes at the end of each book as well. The author seems really dedicated and careful when it comes to writing, to make sure everything is accurate and makes sense. Which I appreciate when heavy time travel is involved. And the sprinkling of philosophy is neat as well. Really stretches through the series.   Well, yeah, he also says everything he says is just a theory, and that there are factions within his Agency that want to tell Haruhi everything. I love Koizumi's character, but I trust him as a source of information only when he shows his more emotional self, rather than generally overall. That's who he is.   Koizumi brings up great points, and generally I'd say he's trustworthy about the nature of Espers. Given he's the only source we have. But that's another thing I love about the series, is that none of the narrators are reliable. Not even Kyon."

Haruhi,2ycoez,u64u,1 point,Sun Mar 8 17:27:31 2015 UTC,....I thought a capella usually meant singing without any musical accompaniment like here?  Your voice is really nice either way though.
Haruhi,2ycoez,appropriate-username,2,Sun Mar 8 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, the songs are self-made in the sense that they were derived from the existing albums and singles of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. I am not the person singing (lol) in them, that's Aya Hirano, Yuko Goto, Minori Chihara et.c. ...     I create these by taking a song that comes both in a ""normal"" version (vocals+instruments) and an karaoke version (instrumental only, no vocals). I cancel out the instrumental part and then I'm (ideally) left with vocals only, an acapella version of the song.     There's a lot of tutorials on youtube, here's a random one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGbJvSJhSzA     You're quite right. An acapella song should by definition be vocals only. In most cases the two audio tracks have tiny differences which results in that not all instrumental audio is cancelled out."
Haruhi,2ycoez,kuletxcore,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:31:34 2015 UTC,"nice one.  Can you make a voice only (no instruments) version of ""God Knows"" and send it to me?  Thanks."
Haruhi,2yc5be,KingOfStickers,3,Sun Mar 8 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they enter closed space through the rift round the edge of the closed space. Their powers seem to be pretty crazy, but can only be used in closed space."
Haruhi,2yc5be,xxninjatacoxx,2,Sun Mar 8 14:36:14 2015 UTC,"How do they enter closed spaces in the first place?    They have to be at a certain place at a certain time (specifically when haruhi has a 'mood'). Then they use their 'esper powers' to enter.   And what determines there powers.   Haruhi.   Can they choose (and it is leveled down to make it not over-powered), or is it automatic?   Why would it need to not be over powered? The whole point of the powers is to take down the big guys in closed space. That's literally the whole point.  To clarify, their powers can only be used in closed space. Koizumi covers this in one of the earlier episodes. Outside of closed space, he's powerless. His only 'power' is knowing how to enter closed space. Once he enters closed space, he gets more powers to take down the thing.  So... automatic. Koizumi's explanation is ""He just knows, you know?"""
Haruhi,2ybal2,ZeroCiipheR,10,Sun Mar 8 05:34:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's great that they just went full fuck it all and did nearly identical eps 8 times in a row, it makes the payoff so worth it and the movie so much more awesome."
Haruhi,2ybal2,RephaimSheol,2,Sun Mar 8 14:10:15 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's stupid and frustrating while you go through it, but that's the entire point. It really drives the point home and gets it into your head. Huge payoff.  Does that make it something I want to watch more than once? Hell no. I still browse the web or w/e when I'm showing it to someone else, lol.  All in all though I've watched the E8 quite a few times now."
Haruhi,2ybal2,Kafke,10,Mon Mar 9 09:27:28 2015 UTC,"To all the people who criticise endless 8 as being boring and repetitive remeber Yuki didn't do it 8 times, she did it 15,532 times."

Haruhi,2y8mma,xxninjatacoxx,7,Sat Mar 7 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm really looking forward to the sub, I don't have anything specific against dubs but I never really watch them outside of Ghibli, though I have heard the Haruhi dub is quite good. I suppose it's the fact they're in Japan, so them speaking in English would really disengage me, and I've grown pretty attached to the sub cast. Still, whichever way you watch it, it should be awesome! :D"
Haruhi,2y8mma,Waffleman1230,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:39:20 2015 UTC,That's actually an interesting point you've made about the subs that I've never really though about!  It really will be awesome =)  Even the character designs look like a nice change

Haruhi,2y8mma,mwzzhang,5,Mon Mar 9 03:11:10 2015 UTC,Definitely the dub. I'll watch it in Japanese as it come out but when the dub is released I'll definitely re-watch it.
Haruhi,2y8mma,RayOfWill,2,Sat Mar 7 14:57:47 2015 UTC,forever sub
Haruhi,2y8mma,appropriate-username,2,Mon Mar 9 02:49:55 2015 UTC,If a company like Funimation [who recently got the rights to TMOHS] could localize the Nagato anime and reunite the original dub cast like they did with Hellsing it would be the most awesome thing ever.
Haruhi,2y8mma,appropriate-username,2,Mon Mar 9 04:33:57 2015 UTC,"Japanese dub.  But given that my Japanese is twenty kinds of bad, I guess I'll still have to rely on English sub for now."
Haruhi,2y8mma,Kafke,2,Sat Mar 7 15:04:55 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that Funimation picks it up and does a broadcast dub of it. That'd be sweet.
Haruhi,2y7msj,GrayStandard,4,Sat Mar 7 04:27:20 2015 UTC,Looks like you all had a lot of fun. I would have loved to join you. Too bad I live on the other side of the country.

Haruhi,2y7msj,1tobedoneX,2,Sat Mar 7 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, I kinda live about 340 KM away from Detroit, which is about 210 Miles, and that is 194 Minutes for you guys in Michigan. (194 minutes is 3 hours and 14 minutes.)"
Haruhi,2y7msj,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Sat Mar 7 18:09:39 2015 UTC,Hey! I know how far 3 hours is! I used to drive further than that for week every week. :P

Haruhi,2y2j24,lulhead,9,Sat Mar 7 02:07:29 2015 UTC,"High quality on the official site: here  People will have a hard time liking this Kyon, because is not the same Kyon we all know; this is you typical light-headed MC. That's because is a romantic-comedy. Is ok if you don't like it.   This is not a spin-off based on the Disappearance of Haruhi. This is totally its own story.   Which is weird to me, why didn't the author continued the story of 'what if Kyon would've stay?' And little by little building up the characters; would've been interesting seeing Nagato change as time went by, and we would've had Kyon questioning if this was really the best choice, but little by little getting accustomed to Nagato and everything. Some may say that the author just wanted the fame the franchise had to start her own romantic-comedy story, and they might be right."
Haruhi,2y2j24,shinigami3,4,Fri Mar 6 05:31:17 2015 UTC,"Well, its not like that for two reasons, I believe. Firstly, if Nagato Yuki-chan kept normal Kyon, what would it be like? How long would Kyon complain about how he had his perfect normal life? If he had chosen it, what would he have to complain about?   Secondly, believe that Nagato Yuki-chan is told through the eyes of, well, Yuki. Sure there are some parts where she's not centered on, but this is her story of her normal life surrounded by the various people that make her happy. This is probably why we don't get deep inner monologues from Kyon, and he appears as a simple, calm kind etc etc generic guy. I could be grasping at straws, but that's what I think."
Haruhi,2y2j24,fatblackninja,3,Fri Mar 6 11:45:32 2015 UTC,"This is the way I see it as well. If this is really it's own story, there is no point in it being about the cast from Haruhi other than to capitalize on the success of the original series. Ironically, if the point is to attract fans of the original series, they will actually be the ones having the most difficulty adapting to the series. I would have a very hard time watching this and trying to separate the characters from the way I know them. I feel like if this was just it's own romantic-comedy, I would probably enjoy it (because I like romantic-comedies). The connection to the original series for me has a negative impact so far, exactly the opposite of what the author wanted to achieve."
Haruhi,2y2j24,fatblackninja,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:32:00 2015 UTC,"What, really? I had no idea. The main reason I like Haruhi is Kyon's sarcasm. Completely unhyped for this now :("

Haruhi,2y2j24,MelancholicGod,3,Fri Mar 6 01:19:33 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully the people of this subreddit will go into it more with a ""I shouldn't talk crap about it before I've even seen it"" attitude instead of a ""ew fuck change new is bad"".  I am partially guilty as well though, so I shouldn't really talk. But I'm still trying to keep my negative thoughts down and give it a chance before I shoot it down."

Haruhi,2xqv8o,Kafke,2,Tue Mar 3 04:19:24 2015 UTC,"It's a subbreddit for the series/franchise ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya""."
Haruhi,2xqv8o,DarkStar5758,1 point,Tue Mar 3 11:54:57 2015 UTC,"The subreddit for all things Haruhi (except for that Host Club imposter).  Edit: Unless you mean you've never heard of the anime. It's for The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya, The Disappearence of Nagato Yuki-chan,  and their manga/novel counterparts."
Haruhi,2xqv8o,appropriate-username,1 point,Tue Mar 3 04:54:24 2015 UTC,Thank me later
Haruhi,2xqv8o,Kafke,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:53:21 2015 UTC,:\ I can't stand Kyon's japanese voice. It's too enthusiastic.
Haruhi,2xqv8o,appropriate-username,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"And I hate Haruhi's voice in the dub--sounds too high-pitched and bitchy to me, even for Haruhi. Clearly, the answer then is that to create the proper version of Haruhi, someone has to cut out the English dub of Kyon out and paste it in the appropriate parts of the Japanese version of Haruhi."
Haruhi,2xn935,DarkStar5758,5,Mon Mar 2 06:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that Kyon should be on the robe cloud along with Mikuru and Nagato, and young Haruhi should be on the grass, all excited."
Haruhi,2xn935,otakuman,1 point,Mon Mar 2 15:12:53 2015 UTC,Or Yuki on the grass. Haruhi actually created her.
Haruhi,2xn935,otakuman,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"If Yuki is on the Grass, the Integrated Data Sentient Entity should be on the cloud. But WHAT is the Integrated Data sentient Entity?"
Haruhi,2xn935,dayum-son,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"IIRC the DITE only came about because Haruhi Wanted Aliens. Mikuru and Itsuki would still exist, just without supernatural powers. Yuki, I think, may owe her very existence to Haruhi's powers awakening.  I just imagine the DITE like the Matrix. Data that exists and affects the world but cannot be seen touched or felt."
Haruhi,2xmkgl,1tobedoneX,2,Mon Mar 2 02:29:29 2015 UTC,Ohmygodthisisadorable. I love this picture.

You could have easily made these images into an album.   I'll let it slide once, but next time I'll remove the threads and send you a pm. We've had a spamming problem before and I don't take too kindly to it. I apologize if it seems rude of me but I had to say it."

Haruhi,2xmkgl,Kafke,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"We've had a spamming problem before    Providing content to a dead sub = spamming? Unless I'm not thinking of the same time as you.  Either way, you're right. The sub is more than active enough now to warrant an album post instead of individual threads."
Haruhi,2xmkgl,Ra5han,2,Mon Mar 2 05:13:32 2015 UTC,Few people =/= no people
Haruhi,2xmkgl,Kafke,1 point,Mon Mar 2 12:29:02 2015 UTC,"Generally ""dead"" subs (as in a few users, and only one post a week/month) are generally more than happy to get posts, even if they come in a burst.  There's only really one point in the time I've been here that'd I'd say was spamming. And it was more of just a desire to get the sub going.  But w/e. I don't really care either way. But I do know that /u/1tobedoneX is at +39 for me, and I always see his posts.  How many people actually submit stuff here anyway?"

Haruhi,2xmway,Zinx10,3,Mon Mar 2 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"I much prefer Bouken Desho Desho, something about the lyrics and the way they're sung really speak out to me.. Especially the intro line.  The video linked here says ""My smile is always on the inside,"" but I think that's is wrong because most lyrics websites say the translation is more something like ""The answer is always within my heart.""  However,  I do have my daily morning alarm set to Super Driver lol."

Haruhi,2xmway,Kafke,3,Wed Mar 4 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Super Driver. Particularly I like the video portion of the opening (the song is pretty average). And I'm more fond of upbeat openings than slower ones. But that really depends on the anime.  Bouken Desho Desho, while a good song, doesn't really work for Haruhi's OP, IMO. And the video isn't all that great either.  Edit: And the shrug+shaking head is easily the best part of either OP. Not sure why I like it so much."
Haruhi,2xmway,AusBox,2,Mon Mar 2 05:16:07 2015 UTC,Super Driver has always been my favourite OP from any show.
Haruhi,2xmway,Kafke,2,Mon Mar 2 06:07:51 2015 UTC,Really? Not even Steins;Gate or Baccano top it?
Haruhi,2xmway,AusBox,2,Mon Mar 2 12:40:49 2015 UTC,I haven't seen either of them.
Haruhi,2xmway,Kafke,2,Mon Mar 2 13:16:18 2015 UTC,Steins;Gate  Baccano

As is Death Note (both, but I like OP2), watamote, angel beats, Lucky Star, etc.  But the one that really gets me going? That I was addicted to for a month straight? This motherfucking OP. Particularly this part.  Like all good things, it causes my mind and gut to do weird things."
Haruhi,2xmway,appropriate-username,2,Wed Mar 4 05:43:44 2015 UTC,"As is Death Note (both, but I like OP2),    Same, I liked OP2 a lot more (both visually and the music) which is why I didn't link the first one.

Just the way it sounds, the lyrics, etc. gives me a feel of an adventure (the point of the song).  That is why I particularly enjoy it.  I do understand why people would enjoy Super Driver (that is really catchy)."

Haruhi,2wv9fb,supremeumbra,14,Mon Feb 23 13:19:31 2015 UTC,I feel the same way about the whole series. I'd rather have more og Haruhi than this new one.

Haruhi,2wv9fb,SirPrize,3,Mon Feb 23 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he looks so much more generic now."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,Kafke,8,Mon Feb 23 22:11:34 2015 UTC,Who the hell is the guy on the left and what did he do with Kyon?
Haruhi,2wv9fb,fatblackninja,5,Mon Feb 23 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it isn't KyoAni (and we all know how KyoAni is famous for their animation style which has progressed since haruhi debuted) so, can't really say I'm surprised."

Haruhi,2wv9fb,DarkStar5758,3,Mon Feb 23 21:36:11 2015 UTC,Using the same face base but slightly changing features like hair and eyes. Example
Haruhi,2wv9fb,Kafke,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"So.... just the same head shape? I should probably clarify that I'm face blind. I don't really see a problem with that image.  Do character faces not usually do this?  If anything, the new Kyon design looks more generic to me. While I much preferred the old one because he stood out."

Haruhi,2wv9fb,Kafke,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"lol. The sad thing is, that if it wasn't showing the blatant comparison, I probably wouldn't have noticed.  For the longest time I just figured anime faces were all 'the same' anyway."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,appropriate-username,1 point,Wed Feb 25 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"anime faces were all 'the same'   That's not really fair. There are obviously generic 8D faces but there are some different schools of drawing within anime like chibi and realistic (another realistic) and fucked up and lazy and wideface and fatface, etc."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,Kafke,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:46:49 2015 UTC,"As far as ""wide face"" goes, that looks chibi to me. But that's not quite what I meant. Obviously if they are a different style, they'll look different.  I meant more of this, this, this, this, this (steins;gate stood out a bit because the guy has a long face), this and so on."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,appropriate-username,1 point,Wed Feb 25 07:00:17 2015 UTC,"Obviously if they are a different style, they'll look different.   That was my point, it's just that you said you figured anime faces were all the same so you may not have seen styles that differ from the generic 8D style you linked above."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,DarkStar5758,10,Wed Feb 25 07:04:34 2015 UTC,Well this Kyon isn't dealing with Haruhi. Not right away at least.  That explains the expressions but his head is still rounder for some reason.
Haruhi,2wv9fb,mwzzhang,5,Mon Feb 23 14:55:18 2015 UTC,The one to the far left for his reaction to her appearance.

Haruhi,2wv9fb,P-man,3,Mon Feb 23 22:50:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty late for this but i think Kyon's original face just adds to the impact of his tsukkomi and reactions, i hope his new design doesn't take away from it"

Haruhi,2wv9fb,PreacherDudeRox,2,Mon Mar 2 14:48:51 2015 UTC,"Can't say I'm surprised to be honest. There's gonna be differences (look at season 1 and 2 for example) after all artists drawing styles change, as well as production standards. I'm pretty sure it's a different studio doing this too so that'd account for a lot too.  I know what people are thinking but we've all been hoping and preying that a season 3 will come along eventually, and this is at least step in the right direction."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,DarkStar5758,2,Wed Feb 25 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly surprised, what with it being handled by a different studio. I just dislike how baby faced they look now. But to be honest, all the worry is probably unfounded and I'll probably love it anyway."
Haruhi,2wv9fb,Zinx10,3,Wed Feb 25 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"I am totally ok with this, even the manga have different designs of the character's there is nothing wrong with them. The series is a little lighter than haruhi and a lot more normalized and so a lighter, more regular design fits better."

Haruhi,2wlvcq,DarkStar5758,2,Sat Feb 21 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"They are from the PS2 game. The concept of the game was that you could create games, you were Kyon and you had to help everyone. In the end you could play said game. They even mad a 3D animated Hare Hare Yukai dance with those outfits."
Haruhi,2wlvcq,N-TG,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:55:18 2015 UTC,There are a lot of games. DS - PS2 - PSP... A couple of Wii ones too. One is a dancing game.
Haruhi,2wlvcq,DarkStar5758,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:10:43 2015 UTC,There was a DS game? Now I need to further expand the list of things I need to find at a Gamestop that they never carry.
Haruhi,2wlvcq,N-TG,1 point,Sat Feb 21 21:38:30 2015 UTC,To tell the truth though I prefer the Wii games. All the other titles were really mediocre in comparison.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf8QW9eEYPc&hd=1
Haruhi,2wlvcq,fatblackninja,1 point,Sat Feb 21 22:20:09 2015 UTC,Usually the console games are better but my game room is being remodeled so all I have working right now is my N3DS.
Haruhi,2wlpoa,appropriate-username,3,Fri Feb 20 23:41:36 2015 UTC,Awesome.  One of the things that was impressive about the animation in the anime was how musically accurate it is.  And this is as good - I love how Yuki uses a foot-pedal for example.
Haruhi,2wn8u9,iEzhik,3,Sat Feb 21 10:25:24 2015 UTC,"So over at the world of /r/Kanye, Haruhi got referenced, and one thing lead to another and now we're here..."

Haruhi,2wibwg,YCCTH,2,Fri Feb 20 05:02:29 2015 UTC,Another example  Maybe Haruhi doesn't exist and that's why the monitor cables go right through her. Think about it and get rekt. Tyler Durden'd.  Or it could just be animators looking for the quickest fix by blocking shit with a foreground table and hoping most viewers don't notice warps in spacetime.

Haruhi,2weeef,fatblackninja,1 point,Fri Feb 20 10:56:29 2015 UTC,them all being different resolutions?   I used a single sprite sheet that I've constructed in pixlr from the appropriate alien images we had (ctrl+f harr4 here).

Kyon and Yuki are the only recognizable ones in the picture. Miyuki back there is obviously Mikuru, which leaves the guy on the left as Koizumi.  Did I win? Face blindness is hard guys. Damn anime characters cosplaying as other anime characters. And with the different art styles it makes it damn impossible.  Like this? Impossible. Which one is Yui and which is Haruhi? I have no clue. I want to say haruhi is on the left, only because of the hair and the left one has more angular facial features (eyes, mouth, etc) while the right one is more bubbly.

Haruhi,2v7o4i,Nigjah,2,Mon Feb 9 02:23:28 2015 UTC,My favorite part in this animation is the very fluid motion of Haruhi looking at Nagato for the solo.
Haruhi,2v7o4i,Zinx10,2,Tue Feb 10 01:29:59 2015 UTC,"In terms of the actual playing of the musical instruments, the animation in this surpasses the original (which was already really impressive to begin with), but it lacks the personality/emotion of the facial animations in the original."
Haruhi,2v7o4i,NowWeAreAllTom,1 point,Thu Feb 12 12:43:48 2015 UTC,"yes, that was much better than I expected."
Haruhi,2v9tc3,appropriate-username,1 point,Mon Feb 9 05:32:08 2015 UTC,I found a bunch of god knows-related things while looking for an HD version of it on youtube so I'll be posting those over the next few days.
Haruhi,2v5f4r,peep295,3,Sun Feb 8 01:44:06 2015 UTC,"I think something that's important to note is that both Haruhi and Kyon come to realize that Haruhi's treatment of Mikuru's is wrong. It's a bit obvious in the VNs, but Haruhi does this stuff with Mikuru less and less as the novels progress. I think she really starts to treat Mikuru as a human being and not her plaything. It's just within the timescale of the anime, the only person she actually values is Kyon for the most part. Everyone else is accessory to some extent.   So yeah, Haruhi's treatment of Mikuru is a bit squicky, but the author knows that, it's the characters that need to develop to get there."
Haruhi,2v5f4r,Taiboss,1 point,Sun Feb 8 01:54:23 2015 UTC,"Having unfortunately not read the LN's I can't quite comment upon that, but I think even watching the anime progress you see Haruhi change. As you said, it may not be as apparent as it is in the LN's (99.9999999 times out of 100 the source material is better than the anime adaptation).   I think, if you sit down and give it some thought, this series is a lot more than Haruhi grabbing Mikuru's tits or making her do this or that. Yes, that's a part of it, but there's so much more that goes on. You're focusing on the wrong part of the anime if, after watching both seasons AND the movie, that's what sticks out in your mind the most. There's a reason this sub has over 1.5k subscribers (much smaller than other forums I can imagine, especially in Japan)  and is regarded as one of the most watched/loved anime."
Haruhi,2v5f4r,DarkMoon000,2,Sun Feb 8 02:00:39 2015 UTC,redditor for 6 hours   Now that's an interesting troll.
Haruhi,2v5f4r,appropriate-username,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:00:43 2015 UTC,I didn't even bother checking.  Thank you for doing that
Haruhi,2v5f4r,otakuman,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:27:30 2015 UTC,"I gave my thoughts in the original thread (link):   I can't say anything about Love Hina(haven't seen that anime), but in the case of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya there is something important you missed.  Kyon is always against the sexual harassment, and although in teh beginning he never has the guts to stop Haruhi, he does so after she drugs asahina while making the movie. At that point haruhi doesn't just get away with it, it actually hurts her that Kyon is not on her side. And although he forgives her later after that things change, which is especially noticeable by reading the Light Novels. There is actual character developement and Haruhi stops treating asahina as a toy. In the later novels Asahina gets a lot of character development of her own, the whole series gets enormously deep, and one of the things that make it so deep is that the female lead isn't some good perfect girl, but has actually also attributes the reader/watcher can't sympathize with, which are morally questionable.  Nagaru Tanigawa makes it totally clear that this sexual harassment, although part of the comedy is wrong. I don't know how easy that is to notice when somebody only watches the anime, but reading the original source material this is something the reader definitely notices."
Haruhi,2v5f4r,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sun Feb 8 10:06:52 2015 UTC,"Np? Really? -.- Here's a non-NP, HTTPS link.  edit: my other thoughts, copypasted from the comment I left there:   Sometimes I wonder if women actually like this series or if they only cosplay the characters for attention, like with ""Sword Art Online.""    I think attention is a factor in most cosplay.    The women in this series are nothing more than fap material.   Nobody except Mikuru and Haruhi are sexualized in-universe. Yuki has a school one-piece swimsuit in the endless eight for god's sake. Mikuru is sexualized to make fun of the moe trope (and make money) and Haruhi is sexualized to show that she just doesn't care.   Mikuru's role in the series is to be in sexual situations   Yeah, she's there to ridicule the prevalence of moe in other anime.   occasionally provide exposition when Tanigawa wants to cast the illusion of plot in his story.   There were very definite changes/plot progression during the anime. Kyon joining the club and finding out about the big plot twist, for example.   Since that doesn't happen,    Because of the aforementioned plot twist, you can't really do much to Haruhi without substantially affecting a lot of people.   I'm under the impression you actually want us to root for this evil cuhnt   I don't see how that leads to Haruhi being the good guy. She's portrayed as stuck up, self-centered and bossy throughout the entire anime. She's the clear antagonist, the foil to the protagonist Kyon.   But eh, you're a troll so whatever.  edit edit:   I wouldn't go as far as to call this assault.   Well, there is actual assault in the anime when Haruhi acquires her computer."
Haruhi,2uw852,leopold_s,14,Thu Feb 5 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"It depends what country you're in. Most new shows get licensed for steaming, at least in the US. Crunchyroll and Funimation tend to license most shows for US simulcast the same day as the Japanese airing. Funimation bought the license for Haruhi last year iirc, so I'd imagine they might go for Nagato Yuki-Chan as well. If they don't, Crunchyroll will probably get it instead.    Funimation is US only at the moment (there are rumors of upcoming expansion, but nothing concrete), so the show will probably be re-licensed to someone in your own country, it's up to them if they want to show it simulcasted. They probably won't, in the UK at least, it seems like funimation stuff isn't really available till it gets to DVD/netflix.    If Crunchyroll gets it, you're in luck, they tend to license for a whole bunch of countries at one, and they stream to a lot more countries.   Crunchyroll and Funimation are both subscription services with paid and free options. If you pay a monthly subscription fee, you can watch shows in HD as soon as they air in Japan (maybe a small wait if they're running late). If you don't have a subscription, you have to wait a week for each episode, and you can only watch in SD.    The first fansubs usually come out within a few hours of Crunchyroll/Funimation, and are just a reproduction of the Crunchyroll/Funimation subtitle scripts in a slightly nicer font. Other fansubs take a day or two, and will either have an edited version of the CR/Funi script (to try and fix perceived issues) or a new original translation. In addition, these fansubs usually have a karaoke for the Opening and ending credits, and fancy typesetting for translated text to make it blend in better with the picture."
Haruhi,2uw852,ravenwood7040,7,Thu Feb 5 18:53:22 2015 UTC,"The first fansubs usually come out within a few hours of Crunchyroll/Funimation, and are just a reproduction of the Crunchyroll/Funimation subtitle scripts in a slightly nicer font.   Or, in the case of HorribleSubs, a complete rip that come out less than a few minutes after the episode is unlocked."
Haruhi,2uw852,Taiboss,2,Thu Feb 5 19:35:33 2015 UTC,"I tend to believe this blogpost on the subject, as I see no reason for them to lie."
Haruhi,2uw852,BillyBumbler00,3,Thu Feb 5 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"Are...Are you serious? I hope not. It doesn't matter what they say. What they deliver are CR and Funi rips. They can declare themselves to fansubbers as much they want, it's still rips. I use them and can safely post pics of it in the episode threads."
Haruhi,2uw852,Taiboss,4,Thu Feb 5 23:26:06 2015 UTC,"Reading that made me lol. I have a feeling whoever wrote this was either trying to joke around or do a bad troll. Even pointing out Commie (who I personally don't like and try to avoid). Even if I think their subs are shit, Commie do their own TL's.  This can't be a serious post. Their release of Neptunia had funi's intro still apart of the video lolol  I think you all should take a look at their ""about us"" page in case you haven't yet"

Haruhi,2uw852,fb39ca4,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:13:23 2015 UTC,Doesn't their name come from the fact that they think CR subs are shit but better than raw?
Haruhi,2uw852,appropriate-username,2,Sat Feb 7 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, a long time ago CR subs used to be worse than what they are know. So hence the name ""horrible"", so you're not far off.  Then again, on this little bit I could be wrong, I don't quite remember. You're more or less correct haha"

Haruhi,2uw852,fatblackninja,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:33:22 2015 UTC,I actually found that earlier and I'm not sure whether the crossed out lines mean that they've been altered from an original mission statement or are still in effect. I have noticed on fansubbing comparison sites that they're typically listed as unedited crunchyroll subs though.
Haruhi,2uw852,BillyBumbler00,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:37:05 2015 UTC,"Basically, they previously admitted they ripped. Now they don't. Nothing else changed."

Haruhi,2uw852,kooger2439,3,Thu Feb 5 18:48:27 2015 UTC,Not in all cases. A few groups will be a day or two late but those tend to be the highest quality ones.
Haruhi,2uw852,Fallen_Glory,1 point,Fri Feb 6 07:00:15 2015 UTC,So do simulcasts.
Haruhi,2uw852,candycaneforestelf,3,Thu Feb 5 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"If Crunchyroll or Funimation get the rights for your region, then yes it'll be available legally as soon as it airs.  If they don't, then there'll be no legal way for you to watch it as it airs. Honestly, in that situation I don't see a big moral problem with fansubs. We've just fallen in the cracks of a system that isn't keeping up with the times. It normally takes a short time, hours maybe."
Haruhi,2uw852,Vondi,1 point,Fri Feb 6 03:22:45 2015 UTC,Funi will probably get it because they recently got the rights to Haruhi.
Haruhi,2uw852,Thehoennhippo,2,Thu Feb 5 22:53:48 2015 UTC,Guess it's fansubs for everyone outside of North America then.

Haruhi,2umnb5,Tapemaster21,6,Tue Feb 3 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"Pay close attention to Nagato, that's where the differences are. As mundane as it is there's important character development going on though it's extremely subtle. There's a lot going on with her throughout the entire show that I completely missed until after watching the movie."
Haruhi,2umnb5,Tapemaster21,3,Tue Feb 3 20:35:54 2015 UTC,What kind of special edition hour long episodes did you have? 8/2=4ep*25min=~2hours
Haruhi,2umnb5,wolfavenger90,3,Tue Feb 3 17:16:46 2015 UTC,8 half hour episodes = 4 hours.

Haruhi,2umnb5,Ra5han,6,Tue Feb 3 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"When i watched them i saw the first 3 regular. Then #4 in Japanese. Then 5 in Japanese with the speed and sound at 1.5 speed. Then 6 and 7 at 1.5 speed switching between languages. Then 8 regular. Halped pass the time.   As a side note, at 1.5 speed in Japanese, when Mikuru is crying in the middle it sounds like she is underwater. Its funny."

At a bare minimum you could probably get away with it by just watching Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and then Disappearance; but that leaves a lot to be desired."
Haruhi,2ufp2r,flightofangels,1 point,Mon Feb 2 11:42:16 2015 UTC,"It's a simple edit so don't expect feature film quality. Also, I'm working to clump all the other episodes together with their respective LNs. Any suggestions or ideas are welcome."
Haruhi,2ufp2r,flightofangels,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"That probably won't work for The Rampage, just thinking about it: After 8 Episodes of Endless Eight you would have The Day of Sagittarius, resulting in a pretty strange combination.  The Boredom wouldn't be that bad, however clumping together all these side-stories into something movie-like would make a strange watch, I think, if you actually do it you might consider keeping the Opening and Ending (or one of them) between each set of side-stories.  The one novel it'll probably work nice with would be The Sigh, although you might consider to include The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00, despite the fact that it was part of The Wavering."
Haruhi,2ufp2r,SpencersCJ,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:20:32 2015 UTC,Sigh could work and Rampage would work if I just did 3 of the endless 8 and make endless 8 the movie (lol). But yea all the side stories I'll clump the relevant and leave ed and op on the individual episodes. Thanks for the suggestion.
Haruhi,2ufp2r,chillbro88,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:25:37 2015 UTC,"For Endless Eight, you could do one scene out of each in order...culminating obviously with the last one. Make it a one ep length endless eight. Just a thought."
Haruhi,2ufp2r,chillbro88,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why so few people consider Day of Sagittarius to be thematically significant. Everyone goes on about Endless Eight as the thing that ""broke Yuki"" - and of course it is probably the single biggest thing. But in the novels Day of Sagittarius is the very last story before Disappearance, and most of the plot is that Yuki gets Kyon's permission to fuck shit up and do stuff that she herself enjoys??? And Someday in the Rain, well, that's it's own ""no lines for Yuki"" situation.  The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya as a movie is a very aesthetically pleasing concept to me"

Haruhi,2tsvfs,Taiboss,2,Tue Jan 27 06:43:33 2015 UTC,"LN must be spoiled to explain fully.  In layman's terms, Kyon, as narrator, has been controlling the events of the universe subconsciously by his subconscious wanting of the magical universe his child-self left behind. Thus he creates Haruhi to act as the God he is, and he created the other characters and the whole plot, and he's just going along with it, secretly enjoying it all. There are plot points that support the theory, but that is spoiler territory unless another poster wants to come in and say them."

Haruhi,2tlod1,snakes88,25,Sun Jan 25 09:27:29 2015 UTC,"This reaffirms my totally reasonable theory that the Nagato Yuki-chan anime is an elaborate ruse. The first half of episode one will feature the art style shown in preview materials, and follow the Yuki-chan manga closely. Right up until Nagato gets restless and goes for a walk late at night. Bam! Art style completely shifts as Kyon steps out onto the street holding his little injector gun. Cue opening credits for Haruhi season 3.  I reiterate: this theory is TOTALLY REASONABLE."
Haruhi,2tlod1,heropon_riki,4,Sun Jan 25 11:48:42 2015 UTC,"This would not really work, as the Yuki-chan flashback is short, and has the Library as the most key point. The 18th of  December does not even come up, if I rememeber correctly.  Also, KyoAni and Ishihara are doing this Emphorioum show, so that would also have to be a ruse."
Haruhi,2tlod1,Taiboss,6,Sun Jan 25 12:08:55 2015 UTC,There's no reason they have to stay 100% accurate to the source material. Especially if it's an elaborate ruse to dupe the fans.  [hype intensifies]

Haruhi,2tlod1,MarshManOriginal,-5,Mon Jan 26 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, without being completed, I don't think the anime is very good.  The series is great, the manga and novels are amazing and I love them, but because the anime is shown in such a batshit crazy order, and the series didn't actually ""end"" properly, it's just so weird for it to exist. There's not much reason to watch it unless you've read the novels and/or manga.  Plus, when half of a season is the same episode just slightly different, that's kind of a problem.  Heres to hoping the series will be finished at some point, but considering it's been 6 years since season 2, I don't see it happening, which leaves to anime in a very poor state."
Haruhi,2tlod1,Zinx10,2,Sun Jan 25 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"Haruhi has always been known to have large gaps between the main production.  Also, base it off of the movie, not the show.  You did see the movie, right?"
Haruhi,2tlod1,flightofangels,2,Mon Jan 26 04:50:12 2015 UTC,"Do you feel the novels ""end properly""? How is The Surprise a satisfying ending to the series? I've only been reading the novels more recently so I'm open to your opinion here, but in my opinion, Disappearance functions perfectly well as an endpoint for the current animated content.   After all, what alternative endpoint would you suggest? Let's assume that back in season 2, Endless Eight was presented as a single episode, and Disappearance occupied most of those timeslots instead (because of course it's not a film ending anymore). Now what could they possibly put chronologically after it to end the series? There are three main options.  (Given your distaste for anachronism I assume you'd prefer to stay away from the new year)   Love at First Sight: This would at least mesh well with the Disappearance episodes, continuing Nagato's arc, but how does it work as an ending for the entire series? Snowy Mountain Syndrome is very good and I'd love to see that house animated, but as an ending it would raise a lot of questions and answers none.  Where Did The Cat Go: I guess ""happy new year"" is decent as an ending, but it can't be presented without Snowy Mountain Syndrome.   I'm looking forward to a third season if there is one, but I highly doubt that's enough to get through all the extant novel material. A third season would probably consist of the above stories, Melancholy of Mikuru Asahina, and The Intrigues of Haruhi Suzumiya. Even if you could cram in the stories from The Indignation of Haruhi Suzumiya, that would be the absolute limit within 14 episodes. Dissociation/Surprise would have to be animated later."

Its especially hard since I never get to go with people I know. The last two I went to were a bit rough for me."
Haruhi,2sg1h0,appropriate-username,3,Fri Jan 16 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"First cosplay? Congrats! I usually cosplay as Jesus (yea I know...lol...) but this time around I really couldn't because of staff work. I only did it for about an hour on Sunday. Though there was a black Jesus there on either Friday or Saturday haha  And yeah, that hall was pretty packed ESPECIALLY on Friday. Jeez, so many people just visiting each con's table and thank god my one friend who was working Con Ops came on his break and we both handled the masses pretty well. Very exhausting, but we did it somehow.   How many cons have you been to? If you're still getting used to them, here's my bit of advice: it's totally cool to go with people you know, but branch out. Find people there that you can be friends with and make those friends. The way I think about it (well, for me at least) I was going with people I knew, so I didn't need to make friends. At AX 2014 I went to the Touhou gathering alone and made a friend or two there. They announced TouhouCon for 2014 at that gathering, and none of my IRL friends are into Touhou, so I said fuck it and went alone.   Holy Crap, Touhoucon was great man. I'm so glad I went alone too, because if I brought a friend with me I would've been sticking with them the whole time and not branching out and meeting all the cool people I met. Of course for the first little bit of time I stuck with the people I met at the gathering, but they were still new friends to me and introduced me to more people and the cycle continued.   Though, I know you know this already but I just want to warn you: a lot of con people are weird too...like really weird haha. So many people who lack common sense and basic hygene...it's quite nasty. So yes, branch out, but be cautious of who you make friends with!  Holy crap man I'm sorry I didn't intend for this to be long...  edit: also, con plague is a real thing and I know too many people dealing with it. I was sick before/at con so I know I don't have it but Jesus...it's bad this year apparently"
Haruhi,2sg1h0,1tobedoneX,2,Fri Jan 16 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Well. This is my 3rd con to Anime CA and PMX. I mean, I havent gone with people I know ever. I've just been rooming with friends I found at AniCA, my first con. Its honestly just kinda hard for me to really loosen up. Its a vicious cycle because I'm afraid of not making friends that I end up...not making friends. ~I'm not popular so I'll cosplay.  Oh Yeah. That too. I dont think or at least...I hope I'm not just being picky, but I also just want to be able to hang with chill people and not the type to put this facade of being superior or cool. (not a straight up weirdo/dick)  Regardless, I guess what I'm saying is that although I do enjoy these cons they do leave a somewhat empty feeling with not being with people to have a good time with. I kinda thought by now I would have. Hmm. I think I managed to avoid con plague though. Ahh. I wish I could be a part of some gathering of something familiar to me. Anyways, any cool cons coming up before AX?   By the way, I wish my work schedule let me be a part of the disappearance stream. :/"

Haruhi,2s4qgz,SwanX17,9,Mon Jan 12 05:47:51 2015 UTC,Whatever you do don't listen to this foul heretic.  Haruhi reins supreme! All hail Haruhi!
Haruhi,2s4qgz,1tobedoneX,2,Mon Jan 12 06:22:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not affiliated with them, but if the person who's reading this is a heretic, besides /r/Nagato, there's also /r/Tsuruya. I don't know if there's something for Sasaki or Asahina."
Haruhi,2s4qgz,otakuman,3,Mon Jan 12 20:47:23 2015 UTC,Isn't there a mutual understanding on this sub that no one really likes Asahina?
Haruhi,2s4qgz,SwanX17,2,Mon Jan 12 20:56:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you never know..."
Haruhi,2s4qgz,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Mon Jan 12 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"Depends, are you talking the young Asahina or the older ""Supersize me"" Asahina with a smile that could defrost Siberia in a microsecond?"
Haruhi,2s4qgz,Taiboss,1 point,Mon Jan 12 21:33:37 2015 UTC,That is an incredibly valid point. I was referring to the young Asahina.  Older Asahina is a COMPLETELY different story.

Haruhi,2rtfyj,RayOfWill,3,Sat Jan 10 16:12:52 2015 UTC,"It is really strange in the context of the anime. It actually is important though, as it comes into play in snowy mountain syndrome, of course that story hasn't been adapted from the novels yet.   Edit: Had to figure out how to do spoiler comments for this since some people might not have read this far yet. Spoiler"

It just wasn't that fun to sit through haha"
Haruhi,2rl25o,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jan 7 02:48:33 2015 UTC,Any specific date? Or just 2015.
Haruhi,2rl25o,Taiboss,3,Wed Jan 7 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"Wtf do I do now   Read the books, watch the spin-offs, wait in anticipation for yuki-chan.   Are the novels the only thing I have left to look forward to for the Haruhi universe?   Watch the movie (Disappearance) if you haven't. But yes, in terms of the main story, it's just the novels. And perhaps Season 3 if we get it.  There's also two spin-off anime series: Haruhi-Chan and Churuya. Haruhi-chan is closer to the main series, while churuya is like it's own thing using the characters.  Yuki-chan anime (a spinoff of disappearance) is coming sometime this year.   Minus the whole Endless Eight thing, haha - what was the point of that?   You only see the last day in the novel. Repeated episodes helps you get Yuki's point of view."

How to Pimp Your Pipboy with /u/LordDurand   Get this mod. I'm fairly certain that you can change your Pipboy background with the default Pipboy, but I don't use the default so the instructions would be different. If you want to keep the default one, then the folder that screenglare.dds is in will be different. Also get this. We'll use it to edit our picture. You can probably use a different art program, but this one makes things simple. Open up Paint.Net, select New, and set the width at 800 and the height at 598 With your canvas ready, get your favourite landscape picture (hopefully it's of Haruhi because she's the greatest), and resize it so no white space is showing. Bonus tip, if you grab one of the corners of the picture and hold down shift while you resize it, it won't get distorted or stretched out strangely. Once you've resized your picture, move your cursor out of the canvas just enough so that the cursor changes to the panning hand with two arrows coming out of it. Once you've got that done, click and rotate your picture until it's upside down. It won't look upside down when you're actually playing the game though. Once your picture is rotated properly, press enter. At the top, there's a tab that says 'adjustments.' Under that tab, there's 'brightness / contrast.' Depending on your picture, you may want to use this to lower the brightness of it so the text on your Pipboy is readable. Once you're happy with your upside down picture, save it as a .dds file and name it 'screenglare.dds.' You can save it wherever you want for now. Next, you'll need to locate your Fallout 3 Data folder. If you've bought the game on Steam, it should be under Steam, Steamapps, Common, and Fallout 3. Once you've found that elusive Data folder, you'll want to navigate into the Textures folder, then into Scorptech, then into Readius. (This step will be different if you're using the default Pipboy. I'm assuming you'll just need to figure out where the regular Pipboy textures are stored.) Now, move your screenglare.dds into this folder. It will ask if you want to move and replace, say yes. Load up Fallout 3. Pull up your Pipboy. Your brand new Pipboy wallpaper should now be loaded, and you can now experience the game the way it was meant to be played, with over one-hundred more hours of gameplay.   If you have any issues with this, send me a message or reply to this comment and I'll try to figure out the problem and solution with you.  Cheers!"

Haruhi,2q14x1,blazzerftw,3,Mon Dec 22 03:25:49 2014 UTC,you summed it up nicely id say.
Haruhi,2q14x1,fatblackninja,3,Mon Dec 22 03:31:57 2014 UTC,Preeeeeeeeeeeeeeetty much.
Haruhi,2q14x1,otakuman,2,Mon Dec 22 11:03:35 2014 UTC,"Well, technically, Endless Eight was written AFTER disappearance. So I think it might be written as a retcon to provide motivation for disappearance. In any case, Disappearance joined the events of EE and Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody pretty nicely.  But yeah, your answers were pretty spot-on."
Haruhi,2q14x1,1tobedoneX,5,Thu Jan 8 05:12:53 2015 UTC,"/u/PenguinBond has already told you about the first 3 questions, but you have to read the 7th Light Novel, ""The Intrigues of Haruhi Suzumiya"" for an answer to the last question."
Haruhi,2q14x1,SleepyShinji,5,Mon Dec 22 03:42:03 2014 UTC,"1 and 3. There was a glitch in Nagato's programing that normally wouldn't amount to anything, but over the thousands of iterations that happened in endless eight the glitch built up and resulted in Nagato desiring the world she created. Without the iterations it's suspected that Nagato wouldn't have developed such strong feelings. 2. She's being punished because she was going against her programming and directly interfering with Haruhi Suzumiya instead of just observing her. 4. I don't know the answer to this one because I haven't gotten a hold of the light novels yet for reading."
Haruhi,2q14x1,twinfyre,3,Mon Dec 22 03:54:56 2014 UTC,"I'm probably going to sound like an idiot for saying this to you novel readers, but I thought that whole thing about Kyon being pushed down the stairs was just code for him being stabbed. I mean, Haruhi was sleeping right next to him the entire time so it makes sense that he wouldn't say directly what caused him to be hospitalized. And I don't really remember any scene with Kyon being pushed down the stairs in the movie anyway.   Koizumi is known for saying one thing and meaning another thing a lot in the show. So it's also in character for him to be the one telling this whole ""stairs"" thing.   As odd as it seems, this whole thing reminded me a lot of the ending of that Twilight movie that was popular a while back. (terrible movie. don't watch it.) When Bella woke up in the hospital she was given all of this bullcrap about how she fell down the stairs and hit a glass window at the bottom and that's how she lost all of that blood."
Haruhi,2q14x1,pxerz,1 point,Mon Dec 22 12:05:59 2014 UTC,"Because ""teaching a robot to love"" never really makes much sense in my head, an addition to that logic could be: because for the entirety of endless eight, Haruhi wanted to relive the same two weeks of summer fun. She probably also wanted everyone else to have fun as well and slowly affected Nagato into developing slight emotions which she wanted to experience more of. Actually they kind of say that at the start of the movie.  For the last one, I haven't read the book so I don't feel bad guessing. My guess is that future Kyon was walking with the group then, when no one was looking, future Mikuru threw past Kyon down the stairs and disappeared with future Kyon. Probably isn't what actually happened though."
Haruhi,2q14x1,Kafke,1 point,Mon Dec 22 06:41:02 2014 UTC,"There's a few answers in one of the later novels. But to answer your questions:   Why did Nagato alter the timelines?   Emotions. Nagato sees them as a 'glitch' or something similar, so she alters the world to prevent it.   Why was she getting punished?   She acted against orders. Much like how Asakura does early on in the series.   How come you have to watch the Endless Eight to understand Nagato's actions   You don't. The novel only shows one of the endless eight cycles. The E8 in the anime simply helps you understand what Nagato was feeling.   Who pushed Kyon down the stairs   Novel Spoilers  The later novel that finishes up the disappearance arc also touches upon what exactly happened during that ending bit."

It's definitely a powerful scene."

Haruhi,2plu89,Valkren,3,Wed Dec 17 22:11:13 2014 UTC,"Aww yis, can't wait for this. Shame it's not by Kyoani, but it really does me good seeing all the familiar names on the cast list. Aya Hirano especially, after all the old rumours of her being kind of done with Haruhi and the speculation of her career being over after the sex scandals.  Not really related, but why didn't she sleep with the bassist of her band? If you're going to fuck a bunch of bandmembers, you might as well finish the set, right? This just further cements my old roommates theory that bassists tend to be weirdos.   ...I used to play bass I'm not bitter or anything"
Haruhi,2plu89,AspiringgMage,2,Thu Dec 18 06:26:08 2014 UTC,Kyon played bass in the Lost My Music video. Make of that what you will. ;p
Haruhi,2plu89,DevoutHaruhiist,5,Thu Dec 18 12:09:50 2014 UTC,Can this be over already so we can move onto season 3? :D
Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,5,Wed Dec 17 21:26:43 2014 UTC,"Given the new studio with the same cast, I'd say things are looking up for S3."
Haruhi,2plu89,DevoutHaruhiist,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:57:16 2014 UTC,Hopefully they don't use the same art they did from this.  Ugh....

Haruhi,2plu89,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Thu Dec 18 00:31:07 2014 UTC,"I like the eyes, its the mouth (those teeth) and how long the faces look. Her head is supposed to be round damnit!!!"

Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,2,Thu Dec 18 12:53:38 2014 UTC,"I saw in the thread on /r/anime that Tsuruya and Asakura fans will be happy with this. As someone who hasn't read the Yuki-Chan books, on a scale from Computer Club President to Yuki, how much Tsuruya do you expect there to be?"
Haruhi,2plu89,Taiboss,1 point,Wed Dec 17 23:04:30 2014 UTC,Emiri Kimidori nah... from a relative POV it's about as much as in the novels.
Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,1 point,Thu Dec 18 07:34:40 2014 UTC,Emiri Kimidori   D:   from a relative POV it's about as much as in the novels.   I suppose that's fine. I'm just hoping it's more than the 3 small bits she got in S1/2.
Haruhi,2plu89,soskyon,2,Thu Dec 18 09:18:31 2014 UTC,Same cast but different studio. WHY KYOANI WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,5,Wed Dec 17 19:51:51 2014 UTC,"IMO it's a good thing. We'll get a proper adaptation without having to worry about excessive trolling.  Glad it's the same cast. I wonder if this studio will do Haruhi S3 as well then. Since the cast seems to be on board for more Haruhi.  I'm guessing it was just Kyoani holding off on the Haruhi stuff. If the new studio is on board, perhaps we'll get more adapted!  #S3Hype"
Haruhi,2plu89,Arvediu,2,Wed Dec 17 22:56:45 2014 UTC,"Why would KyoAni hold off a new Haruhi season? They have literally no reason to do so, right? To be honest, I will be pretty sad if Season 3 ends up happening and KyoAni isn't there...   Although I would watch it and enjoy it regardless."
Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,3,Wed Dec 17 23:53:26 2014 UTC,"Probably because they are busy with their own projects. Lots of other things to be done, and being stuck to haruhi doesn't grant many new viewers.  They are also doing a lot of their own stuff now.  I doubt Kadokawa would hold it off, they've been milking haruhi this whole time, with the novels, the manga, the Yuki-chan manga, the pachinko machines, etc.  And it seems all the VA's are on board, so I can't imagine they'd be holding it back, though perhaps that might be the case. But given KyoAni isn't working on this spin-off, I'm guessing it's them.  Might be why we are getting Yuki-chan instead of S3 as well. Simply because it's easier to pass off to a different studio, so more haruhi anime is produced, without a swap in animation studios for the main series.  Either way, if Yuki-chan goes well, I think we might be getting S3. If KyoAni is the real reason they put it off for so long, that is."
Haruhi,2plu89,Arvediu,2,Thu Dec 18 00:13:58 2014 UTC,"You have good points but... I don't know, I don't think I can agree with you, I guess will see what happens in the future, but I really doubt KyoAni wouldn't do another Haruhi Season if offered."
Haruhi,2plu89,Houreki,1 point,Thu Dec 18 07:26:08 2014 UTC,"Kyoani wasn't the one holding off the serie, Kadokawa is the owner of the Haruhi series and since there hasn't been a new novel in a while there's no point for a third season since the anime is used to promote the source material."
Haruhi,2plu89,Kafke,1 point,Wed Dec 31 07:30:52 2014 UTC,"Kadokawa is the owner of the Haruhi series and since there hasn't been a new novel in a while there's no point for a third season since the anime is used to promote the source material.   This doesn't make sense, considering the majority of the novels aren't adapted yet. Yes, there hasn't been any new ones in a while, but there's still plenty of unadapted material. My guess is that you'd need seasons 3 and 4 in order to cover it all."

Haruhi,2ny8s1,rook2pawn,13,Mon Dec 1 16:27:10 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. The Endless 8 was a troll-ish move by KyoAni's part. The novel only has one iteration (Kyon's perspective). IMO, the 8 repetitions really put you into Yuki's shoes, and works as a brilliant build up to the movie.  The rest of the anime is much less troll-ish and IMO much more entertaining than sitting through the same episode 8 times."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,Kafke,5,Mon Dec 1 18:14:04 2014 UTC,"I thought it was great.  Here's my lengthy spiel about why, from another thread."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,stanthebat,2,Mon Dec 1 17:50:21 2014 UTC,"That is actually a really good point that you made.  But imagine you are in charge of storyboarding Haruhi season 2 and they go ""ok, we want to portray Yuki's suffering in the endless eight arc, we have budget for eight episodes for it, how do we want to do this?""  Can you honestly say that what they did was even close to the best option?"
Haruhi,2ny8s1,Pentbot,3,Tue Dec 2 08:28:20 2014 UTC,"The best option, compared to the infinite number of other possible things they could have done?  I don't know.  I think what they did had a real impact on me, and is one of the most memorable and interesting experiences I've had as an anime fan.  In fact, I like to imagine the creators sitting around a table and going, ""Oh my God... this will piss off so many people... nobody will even believe that we did it... we'll be lucky to keep our jobs... LET'S GO FOR IT.""  Fuck, I'll support that kind of decision-making every time.  There is a LOT of anime that's the thousandth rehash of something that was boring and chickenhearted even the first time around.  The safe, obvious, commercial choices get made so often that you could forget there was any alternative.  This is at least unusual and uncompromising.  So yeah... I'M ON BOARD!  I demand a third season of nothing but more Endless Eight episodes!  WITH A RECAP EPISODE!!!!    :)"
Haruhi,2ny8s1,stanthebat,4,Tue Dec 2 13:38:03 2014 UTC,"I actually like Endless Eight a lot. I think it's interesting from an animation/filmmaking/storytelling perspective how the same events are shown multiple different ways. If you're looking for things to actually change then I guess it could be frustrating, but if you go in knowing it's going to be the same then you can just let it wash over you."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,NowWeAreAllTom,5,Thu Dec 4 05:00:14 2014 UTC,"I quite liked endless 8 it made us as viewers feel closer to Nagato a character who had next to no character development throughout, and made us feel like her, it also add to the disappearance which was all Nagato's fault."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,Starcfc,14,Mon Dec 1 20:49:28 2014 UTC,"Yeah endless eight is really the only flaw in haruhi  Well I should probably say more. Basically endless eight was really boring and stuff, which you don't need me to describe it anymore. The remaining episodes, especially if you're doing 2009 order are good. (Mainly because it just has more to it). The movie is argued to be the greatest thing ever created. So yes keep going"
Haruhi,2ny8s1,IgnitedSpade,8,Mon Dec 1 16:28:19 2014 UTC,The movie is even greater than the greatest thing ever if you sat through the entirety of endless eight

Haruhi,2ny8s1,gallerdude,4,Sun Dec 7 08:22:14 2014 UTC,"Wow, first off, let me congratulate you on completing Endless Eight. That's quite an accomplishment!  Please finish the rest of season 2.  Season 2 is a fantastic season, with the sole exception that is Endless Eight.   When you finish Season 2, definitely see The Disappearance. Hell, if you don't finish Season 2, see it. It is a fantastic movie, and is wholly worth watching. I always tell people that half the fun of Haruhi is Season 1-2, and the other half is The Disappearance.   Have fun finishing your adventure, I wish I was in your shoes!"
Haruhi,2ny8s1,jereddit,2,Tue Dec 2 03:55:36 2014 UTC,"Season 2 is a fantastic season, with the sole exception that is Endless Eight.   Well, the Endless Eight did sort of take up more than half the season. I like the rest, but the majority was centered around that arc."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,Zinx10,2,Tue Dec 2 10:56:36 2014 UTC,"I would definitely recommend watching the rest. Endless Eight is very much the exception, not the rule. If you sat through that, then there's really no reason not to continue watching. The rest of season 2 is still extremely fun and it features some of the most brilliant scenes in the entire anime near the end. And of course the movie is a complete masterpiece as well. :)"
Haruhi,2ny8s1,Taiboss,2,Tue Dec 2 00:06:14 2014 UTC,"The show is definitely worth continuing.  It is the hardest part to go through, but if you did just that, the other will be a breeze.  It was a huge gamble that KyoAni did, but I think it paid off."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,in-sanity,2,Mon Dec 1 17:40:50 2014 UTC,Welcome to the year 2009. We all wanted the end.

Haruhi,2ny8s1,MrSchnieke,1 point,Wed Dec 3 21:44:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah it felt flat, but I find solace in the symbolic and metaphorical representation Endless 8 represents. I go to work and do my 8 everyday endlessly and turning and 8 horizontally/on its side is the symbol for infinite."

Haruhi,2ny8s1,Anonymous7056,1 point,Wed Dec 17 22:24:42 2014 UTC,"If you think of it as an avant-garde way of showing the agony and desperation that Nagato Yuki experiences that drove her to do... what she did in 'Disappearance', it might work better. Then again, I didn't exactly watch it. I mean I did 'watch' all eight, but I was also writing an essay at that time, so I wasn't exactly paying full attention.  OK, kyoani actually ran out of source materials before the 'Disappearance' novel to draw (they already did an anime original (Someday in the rain) in the second season. I mean they can't badger Mr. Tanigawa for more script because he was so busy writing 'Disassociation'), so they have to pull that.  Edit: I messed up the release date. I guess long-term memory is not to be trusted."
Haruhi,2ny8s1,otakuman,3,Mon Dec 1 16:57:41 2014 UTC,"They didn't run out of source material. By the time EE was out and season 2 was being made, there were (I believe) six other short stories to pull from. Condense EE down to two episodes, and there you go."

Haruhi,2nrme8,Thehoennhippo,7,Sat Nov 29 16:46:11 2014 UTC,>Reading the book before the movie.  You fucked up son. The movie is maybe of the best adaptions of a book I have seen. Even better than the original itself.
Haruhi,2nrme8,Taiboss,1 point,Sat Nov 29 17:06:10 2014 UTC,"I somewhat disagree. The scene at the end where Kyon tells Nagato about his secret plan lost so much weight.  In order to please the fans, they totally changed the scene. Kyon was supposed to still be in the hospital bed. The rage he felt against the data entity (because he cared about Nagato) and that showed his badassery in a pure unadulterated form was changed into an absurd love declaration facade that didn't fit at all in the narrative.  Well, other than that, it's still a wonderful adaptation. I still prefer the book, tho."

Haruhi,2nrme8,Abcdety,1 point,Sat Nov 29 21:52:21 2014 UTC,One of the best novels and definitely the best part of the anime. I'm glad you enjoyed it so much! Hopefull you'll catch up with us soon and join in the long wait for new material.
Haruhi,2nrme8,Argryos,1 point,Sat Nov 29 23:45:05 2014 UTC,Man posts like these are making me pumped to watch the movie. I can't wait to catch all the details I missed and just bask in it's glory.

In the last thread I talked about possibly getting some other people to stream as well on days and times I won't be available for those who can't make my stream.  I still have yet to talk to them though, but some are already on board. It's just a matter of confirmation with them.   I could make everyones lives a lot easier and upload the movie to like google plus or whatever and just give them the link, but I'd probably have to delete it after everyone is done. Things will get sorted out, we still have a month"
Haruhi,2lufhx,Fallen_Glory,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:07:47 2014 UTC,What kind of upload speed is needed for the stream? I might be able to volunteer to help just in case multiple streams are needed.
Haruhi,2lufhx,Fallen_Glory,1 point,Fri Nov 14 18:10:02 2014 UTC,"For a good quality stream, I'd sat at least 3 mpbs up.  It's doable with just 1 (I'm able to do it somehow lol), but I have to downscale. Plus there are pixels everywhere.   I'm just going to upload it to google drive and give only the streamers the link. That makes life so much easier, and that way they don't have to worry about setting up their stream for the first time or whatever. I'll have to talk with some others at /r/groupanime, but I'm totally fine with some of them using groupanime's cytube page. I'll give temporary mod to the streamers. Unless they want to use/make they're own, I don't mind one bit."
Haruhi,2lufhx,Fallen_Glory,1 point,Fri Nov 14 20:24:01 2014 UTC,Only 3 mbps? Then I for sure have a good enough connection cause I've got 5 times that :D If you need someone to stream it just let me know!

Haruhi,2lufhx,twinfyre,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:19:12 2014 UTC,"I have never streamed anime to a group before. I do however, stream to Twitch a decent amount and have done this more than a few hundred times. If I'm able to use xSplit or OBS to stream to your site it should be pretty easy for me.  Like I said, especially since I'm inexperienced with streaming anime to a group, use me as the backup guy!"
Haruhi,2lufhx,twinfyre,1 point,Tue Dec 9 02:49:53 2014 UTC,"I <3 OBS. Then again, that's just me personally. I have little experience with xSplit, as long as it does a window capture and you capture your media player only (and are able to resize it as needed), or you can resize the active area that's being streamed you're set.   If you're on a dual screen pc like I am, streaming couldn't be easier. Fullscreen anime on one monitor, have stream chat open on the other. If it's on a single display it can get tricky but you're experienced so I'm sure you know the struggle haha.   I really appreciate it man, and if somehow something craps out you'll be hearing from me. Also you're services won't go unnoticed. <3"

Are there different translations? Which ones the best?   There's an official translation, so I'd suggest those. I'm personally reading some random fan translation I got in PDF format.   Do they continue beyond Disappearance?   Yes, and some anime stuff is in books after disappearance. Disappearance is book 4. I'd recommend starting from book 5 (Rampage), even though some of it's old/anime stuff. The first four books you don't need to read, unless you just want to see differences (very few).   Where can I read them for free? And hopefully purchase later?   You can probably find a torrent for them. I can't remember where I found my copies. Though, asking for this is against Reddit rules, and probably the sub's rules as well. Just google ""haruhi novel torrent"" or something of the sort.  You can buy the official translations on amazon.com."

Just like you'd read any other series. Official versus good old Baka-Tsuki. Decide for yourself, official leaves out suffixes, but it at least doesn't have the ""Miss Asahina"" bullshit form the dub. Book 5 (Rampage) is the way to go! Disappearance was Book 4, so just continue after that. Be wary, though, 2 of the 3 story in Book 5 were adapted in the series. There is a torrent for all 11 volumes (Baka-tsuki version) at the site everyone in the anime community uses. I hope you know its name, I won't tell you. Just search there, or, somewhere else.

Haruhi,2l2ga1,radioactivfishy,3,Sun Nov 2 15:10:30 2014 UTC,"There's no translation patches yet. I'm currently working on translation for a different game, but would be willing to take a look at the Haruhi VNs after.  Not sure how possible it is to patch PS2 games.  Edit: There seems to be Haruhi games for Wii/DS. Which are definitely hackable/patchable. I'll start looking into those soon. I don't know Japanese, so I'd need someone to help translate.  Edit 2: So I got a hold of the DS game, and opened it up to see what I could find. From a quick glance, it looks like the entire game script is located in a single file, and stored with some sort of 2-byte character encoding. Pretty easy once you get a table. There looks to be a lot of Kanji, which might make it problematic depending on how easy it is to dump it.  Some of the intro sequences have voice over clips, which looking into the files seems to be an ADX format, common amongst video games. Getting into these shouldn't be too hard. Anyone interested in doing a dub?  Either way, once I finish my current project, the text shouldn't be too hard to dump/edit/insert."
Haruhi,2l2ga1,Kafke,2,Mon Nov 3 01:36:11 2014 UTC,What sort of programs do you run to read the raw data from a DS game?
Haruhi,2l2ga1,meygaera,4,Mon Nov 3 04:12:55 2014 UTC,"Most modern games (IIRC, Gamecube/Dreamcast and on or so) are actually just compressed archives. Handheld games (like the DS and 3DS) aren't an exception.  For home consoles, they are just ISO/disc files that you can extract (like any other disc). For the DS, it's a specific kind of archive. People have wrote tools to extract the files. In this instance, I used ""DSLazy"" to extract them. But there's quite a few. Just google ""DS extractor"" or something.  From there, we get all sorts of files, depending on the game. Every DS game has a core set of files used to launch them and such (arm7/9, header, etc). For Haruhi, it's easy to see that there's two folders of interest: ""Overlay"" and ""Data"". I looked at overlay, and it's a bunch of generic ""bin"" files (unknown format). So I put them aside. In the data folder you get this:  dat.bin, evt.bin, grp.bin, scn.bin, snd.bin, and the folders bgm, movie, and vce.  Again "".bin"" are generic and tell us nothing besides there's some data. But the names are clues as to what's inside. dat is probably core game stuff: menu asm, and the like. There might be some stuff to determine script order, image/sound loading, etc. So it's worth checking out. More relevant to our interests (translation) we see evt.bin which might mean ""event data"" (hint: that's actually what it ended up being).  SCN looks like our scene order/triggers. But I can't say without messing with it. SND.bin is obviously sound effects.  For the folders we have bgm, which contains a bunch of bgm.bin files of an unknown format. Background music. The movie folder contains two ""movie.mods"" files. A quick google search reveals this is a video format that hasn't been decoded yet. Checking out the game itself, we can see these are probably the OP/ED videos for the game (one appears after the intro dialogue, the other probably appears when you beat the game). If we want to translate the OP video, we'll have to figure out how to edit this (considering it's a well known format, but no editors have been made, it's probably difficult). Luckily there's no story/dialogue in it, and it's just a music video like the anime series OP.  Finally, in the VCE folder we have a bunch of generic .bins with file names such as ""KYN_KYNWIT01"", ""KZM_DETECT05"", ""MKR_TEC00"" and so on. Playing through the game and noting the file names, it's immediately apparent what these are: sound clips that play during certain segments of dialogue. As the characters read the lines that are shown (though not in all cases).  If you want to do a dub (as I suggested), you'd have to edit these.  Now that we have our structure, we need to figure out how to edit the language for the game. Obviously we'd look in evt.bin for the script, as I mentioned. So I started there. This next part gets a bit tricky. Since obviously no one has written "".bin editors for Haruhi"" that means we'd need to do it ourselves. Which means it's time to fire up something called a ""hex editor"". Basically what these programs do is read the binary data of a file, and display it in hexadecimal format (and some sort of text version on the side, for Japanese games, it's best to set it to SHIFT-JIS, as it's a common format for japanese text).  Looking through the file, the first thing we want to do is look for immediately noticeable text. A quick scroll through and text search reveals nothing. I did notice a bit that looks like this though: ""CHR_KYN [random letters] MIK [random letters] NAG"" judging by the game content and what it looks like, it's safe to assume this is probably loading character data. Saying which characters are in the scene/script. In this case, it's Kyon, Mikuru, and Nagato. I also saw something like this ""NONE/SEL001"". All together, this looks like event data to me. So I dug further. At this point, we are fairly certain it's event/scene data, but there's no obvious text.  This means that it's encoded somehow. Which is obvious, since Japanese has more than 255 symbols (00-FF in hexadecimal). We may be lucky, and it is just a common japanese encoding (like SHIFT-JIS) which is why we look using those first, to see if it's easy work (literally just edit in the hex editor). Unfortunately, nothing popped up recognizable text.  So we look for recognizable 2-byte patterns. Typically the first byte notes what kind of character it is (kanji, kana, english, etc). While the second byte is the character itself. Kanji may or may not have several different values for the first byte. We also have to be careful of control codes (to highlight text, make the auto-run wait, etc). Grabbing a random string of hexadecimal from the file, we can see it looks something like this: ""82 8A 20 46 82 AA 8C BE 82 C1 82 C4 82 E9 82 B1 82 C6 82 AA""  Break this up into 2-byte values: 828A, 2046, 82AA, etc. Throughout the file, the most notable is ""82"" as the first byte of a pair. This is most likely a kanji marker.  I pretty much stopped there. So it's really just a guess at this point. If I wanted to guarantee it, I'd simply change one of the earlier values, and look for a change within the game (pretty easy since it'd be early on). From there, you'd simply figure out the exact encoding and format of the file.  Looking back at those voice files, using the same method, we see ""(c)CRI"" towards the beginning of the file and ""AHXE(c)CRI"" at the end. A quick google search reveals the ADX format, which mentioned in my last post.  Commonly, files will have a ""magic byte"" or so that reveals what format it is. In my current project there's magic bytes like ""SBF1"" ""FIB3"" and so on. We lucked out this time and it revealed AHXE, which is apparently a popular format (yay lazy developers).  Naturally, there's a lot more to be uncovered. But that's what I gathered based on my initial assessment.  My current project had a ""__MENU.BIN"" file, and looking at it revealed some sort of archive. So I figured out the format and extracted a list of files. Which I'm currently working through (SBF for menu/scripts, BIF/3FIB for images, etc). I'm wondering if Haruhi might have something similar, seeing as in the dat.bin and scn.bin there's quite a bit of whitespace (meaning static sized of ""something"" with multiple of them). Could just be scene scripts or something (probably). Looking at them, it doesn't seem like there's any text in there. Perhaps in dat.bin there might be menu text though.  So yea, extract the files using existing programs (or write your own if they don't exist), and then view unknown files with a hex editor.  Older games are different, as they usually aren't archives with files, and instead compress it all into a single rom with ASM/scripts/levels/etc all next to each other and interweaved."
Haruhi,2l2ga1,Kafke,2,Mon Nov 3 04:58:51 2014 UTC,"This was awesomely informative. I'll need to take a second read through later to fully process all you've said. For now, one quick question: How do you physically get the raw data off the DS card? Do you install custom firmware on a DS to rip it, or plug it into some DS card reading device connected to a PC?"
Haruhi,2l2ga1,meygaera,3,Tue Nov 4 00:45:52 2014 UTC,"This was awesomely informative.    Thanks. Though I do have a question. Would you be interested in a book that covers all this stuff? I was thinking of writing one, but wasn't sure about the demand for it.   How do you physically get the raw data off the DS card?    Pretty much 99.99% of people just download the ""rom"" (read only memory) off the internet somewhere. To dump games yourself, you need something that lets you read/dump the rom from the cartridge/disc.  Typically with no tools, this means you gotta make some electronic circuitry to connect with the cartridge, much like you would with other electronic devices. Granted, this knowledge is a bit more complex (needing to understand how the cartridges themselves work).  Now-a-days we have something called a flash-card. Which is basically a modified DS cartridge (or GBA, GB, etc) that instead of having a rom with game data, it's made in such a way to read/write from a micro sd card.  On top of that, people have already gone through and have written libraries and such to allow you to write your own code for the console.  The easiest way for a lay-person to get a hold of their own dumped games would be to get a flash card, grab some dumping software and run it. Then swap the cartridges with the game you want to dump and switch back after the process. The game will dump to the SD card, which you can then use on your computer.  The Wii has something similar, where you can load up the dumping software, plug in an external HDD, and dump the disc ISOs.  Personally, I just googled ""haruhi ds rom"" and downloaded it. Though, that's technically illegal :P. So I guess it really depends on what you mean.  Either way, there's many groups dedicated to buying/dumping every game. Typically they either do it for archival purposes (uploading them to the web archive), or they do it for piracy purposes (many people want free games).  There's also a ""scene index"" which numbers each dumped game with a unique value. The DS haruhi game is numbered ""3810"". And if you google ""ds rom 3810"" you can see it indeed pops up.   Do you install custom firmware on a DS    You can. Though personally my DS (not 3DS) is unmodded. I previously used the R4 and am currently using the acekard. Both are modified DS cartridges to allow the functionality I described earlier. You can run custom code on them, rom files (the dumped games), etc.  For something like the 3DS or Wii U, there's no easy go-to solution, as they are still new. I think the 3DS finally has a custom firmware for the older ones, with a virtual firmware feature (much like the PSP has). I know games are being dumped for it. I personally don't have my system modded.   or plug it into some DS card reading device connected to a PC?   This is another solution. Granted, I don't have anything like that personally."

Haruhi Hunt was a promotion for a music video and pachinko machine.  There is no indication that Season 3 will happen, but I think it's a pretty good bet that it will be considered if the anime for The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan does well. It's probably being used as an interest check since it's based on the most recent Haruhi content to date.  There are still only ten books and Tanigawa hasn't said anything about the next one except that there will definitely be more to come. I originally assumed that this was because he wanted to wait for all the books to be translated into English before starting the next one, but it's been almost a year since Surprise made it stateside and there's still no word on Volume 11 so now I have no idea what's taking so long. I'm pretty sure the manga has caught up to the books by now too, so there probably won't be anymore content for the main series until after Nagato's anime is finished."

Haruhi,2kp46n,VolkFrost,5,Wed Oct 29 18:06:46 2014 UTC,"The anime was originally broadcasted at two different times (years apart). The original airing was out of order (it's called 'broadcast order'). Basically it means that season 1 is all out of order, and then season 2 is tacked onto the end (since it aired in order later).  Chronological order is the 'second' broadcast of the series, in which all the episodes are indeed in chronological order (like most anime). Personally, this is my recommended way of watching.  Both orders can be found on this wiki page.  The OVAs are completely separate and simple spin-offs. I personally watched them after the series+movie, but you can watch them any time after you learn the characters.  The movie (Disappearance) should definitely be watched last. No matter which order you choose.   And how about the Manga? It seems it has 2 mangas ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" and ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya""   The manga is actually based on the anime IIRC, which is then based on the light novels (the actual source).  IIRC, there's actually two different Manga (one being significantly shorter than the other). The shorter one I don't think is well known, so we can ignore that.  The manga does indeed share the name ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"".  ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya"" is the spin-off OVA you mentioned earlier. The two OVA series (Haruhi-Chan and Churuya) are based on some smaller manga/comic series.  If you want to read Haruhi, I'd definitely look into getting the light novels, since those are the source material. All of it is officially translated and available for purchase. You can find the order on the page I linked. Though, it's worth noting it's slightly out of chronological order (due to how they were released).  My recommendation is to watch the two anime seasons in chronological order, then watch the movie, and then start from book 5 (Rampage).  That should streamline the process of getting you the entire story. The rest of the stuff is just extras."

Haruhi,2kp46n,Kafke,2,Thu Oct 30 14:48:57 2014 UTC,"Oh and one more question, is the anime kid-friendly?   Uhhh sort of? The majority is a-okay. The only questionable stuff would be one of the characters (Haruhi) grabs the breasts of another shy/sensitive character. Forces her to change clothes (not shown, but heard and is a recurring event), and blackmails someone by making them grab her breasts.  This mostly happens in the first few episodes, while characters are being introduced. There's also one questionable scene where a character is 'drugged' (with alcohol).  I'd preview maybe the first 6-7 episodes, and see what you think.  The rest is absolutely fine. IMO, I'd be comfortable showing this to someone in middle school (hell, that's when I'd have watched it).   Previously, I watched Toradora! and K-On with her and she loves it so much.   I haven't seen Toradora, but K-ON IIRC didn't have any questionable stuff (and is excellent for kids). SAO has some questionable stuff towards the end (of the second arc, I dunno how long it goes on now), so I'd look more into that before just randomly showing it to your sister. The rest of the series is, once again, absolutely fine."
Haruhi,2kp46n,thesecondkira,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:56:20 2014 UTC,"I hate to be redundant here, but I want to make sure before I read 5-6 books, especially since the writer has said he might write another one. Reading these books will give me a satisfying ending? The principle question I want answered, or at least toyed with, is what happens if/when Haruhi learns of her power... If that isn't the direction the books take, I'm not sure I want to read them."
Haruhi,2kp46n,Kafke,1 point,Sat Jan 3 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"As far as I've read into the books (I have 3 more to go until I'm caught up) this doesn't happen.  The most immediate books (5/6) are just more side-stories, and at one point the movie is wrapped up.  After that, the books start to dig into Asahina's and Koizumi's origins/story.  Though, from what I hear, the haruhi thing is expanded on a bit towards the end, but I can't say whether it does from personal experience.  But if you like the anime, I'd definitely recommend the novels. It's mostly more of the same with a bit more explanation and realization what's going on.  Spoilers Related to Haruhi's Power  More characters with abilities (Time Travelers and such) are introduced later on as well.  Either way, the whole premise of the series is that Haruhi can't find out. So naturally it won't happen for a while if ever. Though it's important to note that Kyon does explain all this to the alternate Haruhi."

Yea, I keep reading simply because I want more ""screen time"" with the characters. And to figure out who these mysterious 'others' are. And the why/how about it all. I don't care much for Haruhi herself. And she actually takes a smaller role during some parts of the story.   If you mean in Disappearance, that's a good point. That was a satisfying moment. I just need more of that sort of thing...   Yea. It's not every day Haruhi is let into the loop. Most of the time it's the other characters explaining stuff to Kyon."
Haruhi,2kp46n,SaiyamanMS,3,Sun Jan 4 10:23:33 2015 UTC,"Chronological order for the TV series is as follows:  The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (6 episodes, season 1)  The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya (1 episode, season 1)  Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody (1 episode, season 2)  Mystérique Sign (1 episode, season 1)  Remote Island Syndrome (2 episodes, season 1)  Endless Eight (8 episodes, season 2)  The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya (5 episodes, season 2)  The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00 (1 episode, season 1)  Live Alive (1 episode, season 1)  The Day of Sagittarius (1 episode, season 1)  Someday in the Rain (1 episode, season 1)  The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya (Movie)  The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi-chan is a spinoff parody series which has no bearing on the main continuity. To continue the manga from the point after the movie ends, start with volume 10. To continue with the original novels after finishing the anime, start from volume 5.  Broadcast order is a strange relic of 2006 in which they randomly scattered the side story episodes in between episodes of the main plot of Melancholy so that they could have the high point of the story as the season finale."
Haruhi,2kp46n,stanthebat,2,Thu Oct 30 02:07:54 2014 UTC,"For the sake of balance I'll make the case for broadcast order.  From the TV Tropes page about 'anachronic order':   The Haruhi Suzumiya novels aren't in chronological order. This was retained when the anime was shown in Japan in meta-random order, and helpfully had Haruhi and Kyon arguing over the number of the next episode in the previews. The English edition happens to put the episodes in chronological order, except for the first episode, but the special edition DVDs have the original order as well. The opinions about what order is ""better"" to watch differ. Notably, the series is paced with the anachronic order in mind, and climaxes halfway chronologically.   Broadcast order is not, in my opinion, particularly confusing, especially when you know going into it that you're getting information out of chronological order, and any questions that arise from this will be answered in the space of a few episodes.  Re-ordering them--again, in my opinion--is like reading the last chapter of a mystery novel first to avoid being confused for the duration of the book.  Figuring out what's happening is part of the experience; why spoil it for yourself?  That said, lots of people prefer chronological order; my opinion is just that, and you should do whatever the heck you want."
Haruhi,2kp46n,Kafke,3,Wed Oct 29 23:42:05 2014 UTC,"Anachronic order is fun, but do note that the original season 1 broadcast order is not the order the stories were released (it breaks up novel 1 and throws it between a few other novels).  So it's not really like watching the end first. If anything, that'd be the broadcast order ""spoiling' some stuff that happens later. Granted, IIRC the arcs are still in order with respect to themselves.  IMO, if there was a novel order for the anime, I'd watch it like that. Perhaps if we get the rest of the novels adapted, there'll be people arguing for ""book order"". :P.  Either way, everyone plays favorites. Broadcast is definitely a fun way to get into the series if you don't get fed up with stuff being intentionally out of order (for no particular reason)."
Haruhi,2kp46n,stanthebat,1 point,Thu Oct 30 06:00:46 2014 UTC,"So it's not really like watching the end first. If anything, that'd be the broadcast order ""spoiling' some stuff that happens later.   Well, what I meant was that chronological order removes the sense of putting together a puzzle that broadcast order provides.  It's perhaps not really important to the show, and obviously not everybody likes that disorientation.  My feeling is that there's so much stuff in anime that's based on cliches and stock characters and so on--so much that is trite and worn out--that if you encounter something that's a little unusual and hard to catch onto, you should at least consider weeping for joy that you're not watching another rehash.    :)  Again--all just my opinion, and everybody is encouraged to do what they want, and like what they like."
Haruhi,2kp46n,Kafke,2,Thu Oct 30 14:25:56 2014 UTC,"True. I'm just a big fan of keeping things close to the source. It's the same reason I don't like filler episodes, edited content, changed endings, etc."
Haruhi,2kp46n,Arvediu,1 point,Thu Oct 30 21:49:06 2014 UTC,"Even though the series was re-released in chronological order in 2009, I do believe that the best way to watch it is the broadcast order from 2006. Even though adaptations shouldn't change the source material, they still have to be adaptations, and have their own identity. I do think that they way it was done in 2006 was a good way to do it, and the popularity of the series shows that it actually worked.  A similar example I like is the Lord of the Rings saga. In the books, the story was out of sync chronologically, but in the movie they put all of that into chronological order, although that meant that they had to sacrifice some characters like the Mouth of Sauron. What I want to say is, that, even though the story was told in a different way, it was still the Lord of the Rings.   I can't say the same about Haruhi as I haven't read the novels, but I do think that the best way to enjoy the series is the broadcast order."
Haruhi,2kp46n,Kafke,1 point,Fri Oct 31 13:44:28 2014 UTC,"I do think that they way it was done in 2006 was a good way to do it, and the popularity of the series shows that it actually worked.   Fair enough. Though my rebuttal would be for the second season, which technically wasn't aired at that time. It was aired in 2009 with chronological order. So if you watch both seasons, the ""official"" aired order would be chronological. Again, part of the reason I'd suggest it.  With the 2006 order, season 2 doesn't really have a place, and you end up sticking it at the end in chronological order anyway.   I can't say the same about Haruhi as I haven't read the novels, but I do think that the best way to enjoy the series is the broadcast order.   IMO, it looks like they took the semi-chronological order of the books, and applied that to the original anime adaptation. Which would be difficult/not the same, since the anime originally only adapted the first book or two. Makes sense, keep the idea of stories being told out of order.  The problem being is that the broadcast order breaks up ""arcs"" of the story. The books don't do that. As I said, if there was more episodes, I'd probably argue for ""book order""."

Haruhi,2kktsk,Zinx10,1 point,Tue Oct 28 15:54:06 2014 UTC,"Haven't read all of them yet (but I think the next one is going to be my favorite).  But here's my order of favorites (from favorite to least favorite):  Intrigues  Disappearance  Boredom  Sigh  Melancholy  Wavering  Indignation  Rampage  I haven't read Dissociation or Surprise yet, so I can't say where they fall. But reading the synopsis, makes me think they'll be some of my favorites.  My favorites tend to be those that are complete stories (not a collection of stories), that involve lots of ""Haruhi"" things (Time Travel, Aliens, etc). Rampage, while my least favorite as a whole, contains one of my favorite stores (Snowy Mountain Syndrome).  As far as serious/humorous go: I'd say Disappearance is on the more serious side (Along with Intrigues), while something like Wavering and Sigh tend to be more humorous. Amusingly, I put boredom as the only collection to be above some of the 'whole book stories'. Probably because it includes Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody (IMO the central story of the series and one of my favorites), as well as Boredom itself (which is great fun in both the anime and novel). As far as Wavering goes, I liked most of the stories, but the book as a whole just doesn't stand out. I wish Love at First Sight and Where did the cat go were grouped up with Snowy Mountain Syndrome to make a ""winter book"". That'd probably shoot up to one of my favorites. Live Alive I can never stand. The anime was meh, with the large music portion sucking up the episode, and the novel simply described the music and was much more boring. The only redeeming factor is the small appearance Tsuruya gets (which she has larger parts in other books).    And finally, to talk about my favorites. There be spoilers past this point. Be warned!  Intrigues Spoilers  Disappearance Spoilers  Finally, I'll wrap it up with talking about Melancholy, the original novel/arc. Not much to be said, but it's pretty much what hooked me into the series. Not spectacular, but it's definitely alright. Just an introduction arc, not much else to be said."
Haruhi,2kktsk,Kafke,1 point,Wed Oct 29 20:11:45 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the reply Kafke!  I am currently on Wavering, and I completely agree with Live Alive novel-wise.  I thought the anime episode was great (on of my favorites in the Haruhi anime), but the book was nowhere near as good.  I have been noticing that ""the Wavering"" is more light-hearted, but I thought it would be better than ""Boredom"" (my least favorite Haruhi novel).  While I surely think that ""the Boredom"" had one of the most important arcs, I think the book, as a whole, isn't the greatest.  Here is my order of favorite light novels so far (not counting book 6 or above):   The Disappearance (Near flawless writing) The Rampage (Loved ""Day of Sagittarius III"" and ""Snowy Mountain Syndrome"") The Melancholy The Sigh (Still a great novel) The Boredom    If ""the Endless Eight"" chapter was better (or I didn't have it memorized from watching the anime 8 times), I think it could have passed the Disappearance.  The Disappearance is so amazing, that I was loving every minute of it.  The Rampage was great too mainly due to ""Snowy Mountain Syndrome"" being a nice, refreshing taste with a semi-humorous and serious tone to it.  The Melancholy is great due to it being a nice introduction to the entire light novel franchise.  The Sigh, while great, was just not as good (but really close) as the Melancholy."
Haruhi,2kktsk,Kafke,1 point,Thu Oct 30 00:45:48 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with Live Alive novel-wise. I thought the anime episode was great (on of my favorites in the Haruhi anime), but the book was nowhere near as good   IMO, the writing was fine. But the actual story itself was simply lacking. Much better suited to the screen because of the music. Though, IMO, it's one of the not so great episodes as well. The music is nice though.   While I surely think that ""the Boredom"" had one of the most important arcs, I think the book, as a whole, isn't the greatest.   Huh. With Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and the boredom story itself being two of my favorites, it gets up there. Remote Island Syndrome is better on screen (IMO), but still stands up well in the novel. Mystique Sign is honestly the only chapter I felt was lacking. But I give it a pass because it's ""more haruhi stuff"".   Here is my order of favorite light novels so far (not counting book 6 or above):   Rampage was fun, as I said, no hate. But the Endless eight was a bit stale after seeing the anime, and Day of Sagittarius is good, but really can't hold the novel on it's own. E8 was interesting to see from Kyon's perspective (rather than Yuki's) but it's easily one of the more annoying parts of Haruhi. Which really puts it at the bottom for me. But that's more of me liking the other books more, than not liking Rampage.  Sigh I loved, even though it falls towards the middle of my list. I just like the ""core"" story (in my opinion) more than I like side-stories. And intrigues, disappearance, and boredom all include that which is why they are at the top of my list.   If ""the Endless Eight"" chapter was better (or I didn't have it memorized from watching the anime 8 times), I think it could have passed the Disappearance.   It's hard to say. In the anime, I always felt like the first episode (no time loop stuff) was really lacking. Felt like a filler episode. And that's really what the first part of E8 in the novel is. The time-loop stuff is more interesting/fun, and I think there could've been a lot more done with it.   The Rampage was great too mainly due to ""Snowy Mountain Syndrome"" being a nice, refreshing taste with a semi-humorous and serious tone to it.    Yup, that's one of my more favorites (but the other two stories brings rampage down IMO). Related ""where did the cat go?"" which is pretty much what the SOS brigade was going to do before Snowy Mountain Syndrome happened. Combined, it pretty much makes up one of my favorite haruhi arcs.   The Melancholy is great due to it being a nice introduction to the entire light novel franchise. The Sigh, while great, was just not as good (but really close) as the Melancholy.   While Melancholy introduced the characters, it felt like Sigh was simply an extension of that and did all sorts of fun stuff once we got to know them. Kind of one in the same. Perhaps my memory fails me, and I'd swap their positions. They both great nonetheless."

Haruhi,2jonht,radioactivfishy,12,Sun Oct 19 11:30:38 2014 UTC,"I don't know about the post, but it seemed pretty obvious to me that Haruhi was getting consistently more irked by Kyon's attentions towards Mikuru until she finally snapped at the end.  But Haruhi, even from the very beginning, never really treated Mikuru all that well, Mikuru's like a toy, not a friend, to Haruhi. Kyon mostly let it slide, but it was more like Haruhi was persecuting Mikuru during the movie than just not treating her very well. I think she was just desperate to make the movie and was frustrated by the fact that she knew it wasn't as good as she wanted it to be.  By the way, I don't think it's wrong to hate Haruhi during the that scene (or even during the whole arc). I actually really appreciate that the show doesn't glorify or justify her actions—she's not being a nice or a good person at that time, not matter what her motivations are.  Now, if your friend thought it was out of character for her to act like that, well, I'd disagree on that front. But that, I suppose, could be another reason for him to be angry about it."
Haruhi,2jonht,iblessall,2,Sun Oct 19 17:28:31 2014 UTC,"Mikuru-chan is my toy! Haruhi is very moody, especially when things aren't going her way. Mikuru, and everyone else around her for that matter, are really seen as her toys; they exist to be manipulated by Haruhi for her entertainment. To say that Haruhi's behavior during the directing arc is more offensive than usual is fair, but I wouldn't say that she is necessarily being malicious. Mikuru gets wet in the lake and shows that she cannot handle alcohol at all (notice Haruhi delegates the drugging to Tsuruya-san, as to allow for another's digression and to absolve her of direct guilt). Nobody is really hurt by her behavior. Tensions rise to breaking point, but all is resolved, and eventually Haruhi gets what she wants.    If you do nothing but eat cake under rainbows all day, eventually you will be sick of cake. And rainbows. Mikuru may not have enjoyed the cold sensation of plunging into the lake, but do you not think an older version of Mikuru reflects positively on the overall experience? :P"

I dunno here. I look at it from the POV where Haruhi's behavior has changed from the normal degree at which she abuses Mikuru. So why did she change? That's the question. I don't really have a great answer for that other than what I've already said.   Mikuru may not have enjoyed the cold sensation of plunging into the lake, but do you not think an older version of Mikuru reflects positively on the overall experience? :P   I'm assuming you're probably joking here, so I'm going to sit on my instinct to go after the ""okay outcome justifies the means"" mentality haha. ^_^"""

It's more than worth it reading everything, especially the last two.  Also, I read somewhere that the author intends to make at least one more LN before wrapping it up. It might be a bit sad to see it finally end, but maybe it's about time he does it. The series is more than 10 years old and is getting a bit forgotten by anime watchers at this point, so maybe a new LN / third season might end it with a bang. Sorry about the rambling."

Haruhi,2ji65w,Doughnutcake,6,Thu Nov 6 17:27:16 2014 UTC,I have to go with Someday in the Rain. I know it is an original episode but... I just love it.
Haruhi,2ji65w,Arvediu,0,Fri Oct 17 11:46:03 2014 UTC,That's my second favorite.
Haruhi,2ji65w,Bioman2222,5,Sun Oct 19 02:11:55 2014 UTC,this is going to be a vary unpopular opinion. but....I accually love someday in the rain. okokok stop and hear me out for a moment. that eppisode had a vary slow pace and gloomy vibe to it some people just write it off as boring but underneath theres really more than that. nagato in the room alone gives the viewer time to reflect on the series as a whole and its subtlety. thats my two cents!fuckthepolice
Haruhi,2ji65w,blazzerftw,3,Thu Oct 23 05:54:51 2014 UTC,"I suppose I'll start. My favorite episode is The Day of Sagittarius III. I really loved the epic space battles and thought the plot was pretty cool. (the computer club challenges the SOS brigade to a game).   It reminded me of when I used to play Red Alert 2 with my friends through LAN. We would have these incredibly competitive battles with insane strategies. Ah... those were good times.   And yeah, I'll admit it. I thought it was kind-of cute how, at the end of the episode, Yuki seemed genuinely excited to play against the computer club again."
Haruhi,2ji65w,cpsayhi,2,Fri Oct 17 10:13:22 2014 UTC,I did especially enjoy the OST in this one. The contrast between the game music and the orchestral version of that same song got me. Also...plenty of Nagato in it. So there's that. (Also the crew of each characters' ships. I enjoyed that.)
Haruhi,2ji65w,chillbro88,1 point,Sat Oct 18 09:42:45 2014 UTC,"I never noticed that thing with the OST. I'll have to give the episode another watch. (that would be the second time today)   I just really liked the theme of this episode. It had an interesting premise that could probably stand on its own. A club spends the day playing a computer game while we flash to their overdramatic fantasies about said game. I wouldn't mind watching an entire show based solely on that idea.   That's what I love about this show. You've got groundhog day loops, time paradoxes, whodunit mysteries, baseball episodes, filmmaking, concerts...  The episodes cover a wide variety of genres and they could all work well as a self contained show."
Haruhi,2ji65w,Bioman2222,2,Sat Oct 18 09:59:53 2014 UTC,"Yeah the music in that episode is a big part of the fun.  The two pieces they used were Tchaikovsky No. 4 and Shostakovich No. 7. Great usage, Tchaikovsky's is a big favorite of mine."

Haruhi,2ji65w,Zinx10,3,Fri Oct 17 13:54:07 2014 UTC,"Well, good question. I really like Melancholy part six, because it's awesome. But the final episode of the EE... is really good, seeing it finally end. The second episode of the Remote Island Syndrome has one of my favorite scenes, when they get stuck in the cave. Every episode is top-notch anyway (except Someday in the Rain... don't ask).  As a side note, my friend loves The Boredom for some random reason."
Haruhi,2ji65w,chillbro88,3,Sun Oct 19 09:33:02 2014 UTC,"For me, I would have to say either ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody"" for specific reasons (you know why), ""the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 6"" for the amazing quality, or ""Live Alive"" for the concert.  Obviously, though, the movie is the best part of the anime."
Haruhi,2ji65w,chillbro88,2,Sun Oct 19 20:23:45 2014 UTC,"""Live Alive"" - episode 12  I think it's a combination of a technically well put together episode (as in execution/storytelling) as well as being complex (as in there's a lot of stuff going on), having depth (as in characterization, themes, symbolism), and as having the most meaningful scene in the entire series: one that, in my view, sums up the entire 'reason for being' of TMoHS.  I think this scene sums up my thoughts quite nicely."
Haruhi,2jcm49,Bioman2222,7,Wed Oct 15 20:13:07 2014 UTC,"I'm on mobile right now so I can't paste the full name (it's in japanese), but if you have the OST downloaded its a 1:44 song with ""BGM"" in the title. I will post a link to it later when I get home if you can't find it  EDIT: The song name is ""涼宮ハルヒの憂鬱BGM集～サムデイ イン ザ レイン～ ある雨の日"" Which roughly translates to ""A Rainy Day"" Or ""Someday in the Rain"" Haruhi BGM collection.

Haruhi,2jcm49,kuletxcore,1 point,Sun Oct 19 01:20:18 2014 UTC,"tl;dr people kept asking for the song name in League of Legends streams, and since Sandstorm was apparently a big ""League"" song (which I don't get tbh but I don't play League so I dunno) people would say ""Darude - Sandstorm"" just whenever  I only heard about it when it became a /r/montageparodies* trend after people stated doing the same thing when people asked ""song name?"" in the comments. Then, AncientReality made this and then the whole thing just REALLY took off after that.  So whenever somebody asks for the name of a song, expect someone to say ""Darude - Sandstorm""  (*Montage parodies are (obstinately) parodies of Call of Duty quickscope frag videos, where people add Moutain Dew, Doritos, airhorns, flashing colors, weed, illuminati, gratuitous text effects and dubstep/trap music onto pretty much anything)"

I wonder what happens to Nagato, Haruhi, Mikuru and Koizumi after Kyon activates the emergency escape program because the world doesn't automatically revert back when Kyon presses enter.

Haruhi,2imdjf,Basslin3,1 point,Wed Oct 8 02:08:56 2014 UTC,"No actual transposition should be necessary, as trombones and trumpets are both Bb instruments. You could simply try to read the music in Treble clef, just play three notes lower for every note (three full notes, half notes are irrelevant, as you're simply converting the music from treble to bass, not transposing). For example, what you would normally read as E would be C, a D would be B, etc.    You could also simply learn how to read Treble clef too, it will not be very hard if you already know how to read Bass, and will be very useful if you want to play any of the numerous instruments that utilize the Treble clef."

Haruhi,2imdjf,Pwnapplez,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:44:24 2014 UTC,"I assumed you already had the trumpet part, with your first post. If you don't, I was able to find sheet music for Itsumo no Fuukei on the piano here. The piano and trombone are also in the same key, so, again, no transposition will be required, other than from Treble cleff to Bass. Also, as you obviously won't be able to play 3 notes at a time on the trombone, you'll probably want to just play the right hand (top) part, and select a single note from each chord."

Beginning in Weekly Young Sunday issue 9 of 1987, it was published sporadically until finishing in issue 3/4 of 2007 with the chapters collected into four tankōbon volumes. The story is a fusion of the sports (specifically, boxing) and romantic comedy genres.  Studio Gallop produced an anime original video animation adaptation in 1988. A live-action television drama adaptation starring Kazuya Kamenashi from KAT-TUN and Meisa Kuroki aired for nine episodes in 2008.

Haruhi,2hpn3t,RafaDelBarrio,3,Sun Sep 28 17:35:36 2014 UTC,"With God Knows being my favourite Haruhi Song, and me still holding an interest in piano (although I don't play it anymore), this literally figuratively (although I wish it was literally) gave me a musical orgasm, and I loved it. God Knows, this deserves all the upvotes."
Haruhi,2hpn3t,1tobedoneX,2,Sun Sep 28 18:09:59 2014 UTC,I just realized I haven't seen anyone playing piano in like forever....Just those PC simulation programs. Nice.
Haruhi,2honpw,DoctuhD,3,Sun Sep 28 08:45:04 2014 UTC,"Okay. Asking somebody wh they havent upvoted this post is so stupid, you can't even consider it a topic suitable for idle conversation. But if you still wanna know how long it took me to upvote the entertaining and beautiful cover of a beautiful song, I can tell you this. I've just haven't seen it, yet."

Haruhi,2hf38a,Sailorwaver,3,Thu Sep 25 10:32:30 2014 UTC,"Okay, before I start, go to a secluded island and watch the movie without interruption. Eighty-three times.   Also, you don't need to be sorry, it can get pretty darn confusing sometimes.  Th-there's a LOT more.  The anime series (including the movie), iirc, is only up to the middle of the sixth light novel (The Wavering).  So far there are eleven light novels, so we're about halfway there? Except for Surprise is basically two books...   So far nothing else is confirmed for another season/movie/OVA for the main storyline, however there is a spin-off series coming 2015 (Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan).   If you enjoyed the anime, you should take a gander at the light novels. I'm slowly working my way through them and they are quite enjoyable, and I'm not a huge fan of reading novels. :D"
Haruhi,2hf38a,3ggu,2,Thu Sep 25 11:05:31 2014 UTC,"Clarification: One important short story from novel 5 has not been adapted (Show Mountain Syndrome), and surprise in the 10th and 11th book. Apart from that, all is fine. Now, OP, go watch the movie. It's worth it."
Haruhi,2hf38a,Taiboss,1 point,Thu Sep 25 18:45:39 2014 UTC,"Snow Mountain Syndrome. But yeah, I've read it and the following events that happened after that connected the dots together. That being said, it's not necessary to read it before watching the movie."
Haruhi,2hf38a,SuzumiyaCham,1 point,Thu Sep 25 23:29:06 2014 UTC,Doesn't Snow Mountain Syndrome take place after disappearance anyway?

Haruhi,2hf38a,royhankins,2,Fri Sep 26 01:35:19 2014 UTC,"Please read the light novels. As the people below have said, there is so much more there. Also watch the movie, it's probably the best thing in the series. But yeah, no matter where you stop (anime, movie, novels) it feels unfinished because it is, but it's the continuing story of these characters. There's no real larger story arc, just the shit that goes on with them. Hope that helps."
Haruhi,2hf38a,Kafke,1 point,Thu Sep 25 19:27:40 2014 UTC,"There's no real larger story arc, just the shit that goes on with them. Hope that helps.   Say what you want, but I feel like ""three years ago"" is pretty much the core plot point of the series."
Haruhi,2hf38a,Kafke,1 point,Fri Sep 26 04:36:27 2014 UTC,"Yes, there is more story. Watch the movie if you just want a nice ""anime ending"". Watch it anyway :P.  To be more specific, the anime pulls from the first 4 books, and a couple chapters from books 5/6. IIRC there are 11 books right now.  Just watch the movie, and start reading from book 5 (rampage)."

Haruhi,2hc7i5,zaturama008,5,Thu Sep 25 02:14:53 2014 UTC,The middle row with all the figures bothers me because you have mikuru standing in front of the big haruhi instead of the little haruhi.

Haruhi,2h7do4,Lin4theWIN,7,Tue Sep 23 05:49:02 2014 UTC,yeah. this is the first scene where haruhi seemed alot less innocent to me. proof that in most cases shes the type of character who only thinks about herself. I love it though dont get me wrong haruhi is the reason i love this series.
Haruhi,2h7do4,blazzerftw,2,Tue Sep 23 16:50:20 2014 UTC,THIS......is why I have Nagato as my waifu instead of Haruhi.

Haruhi,2h7do4,DevoutHaruhiist,0,Thu Sep 25 20:29:43 2014 UTC,I don't get why he gets pissed. I wished someone would hit him when he overreacted like that. >_>  Such a jerk!
Haruhi,2h7do4,twinfyre,2,Wed Sep 24 00:53:04 2014 UTC,It might be because Haruhi drugged Asahina to get her to do a love scene with Koizumi.
Haruhi,2h7do4,DevoutHaruhiist,-4,Wed Sep 24 05:45:32 2014 UTC,No reason to overreact like that though. Haruhi just wanted to have fun.
Haruhi,2h7do4,twinfyre,2,Wed Sep 24 12:17:04 2014 UTC,But... She drugged Asahina to get her to do a love scene with Koizumi! Isn't that technically rape?!
Haruhi,2h7do4,DevoutHaruhiist,-2,Wed Sep 24 19:26:11 2014 UTC,"To be fair, Koizomi wouldn't have agreed to it if it came to that point. Also, it doesn't matter cause HaruhI's happiness is more important than Mikuru. And Mikuru probably would have agreed to it anyway for that reason.  Haruhi can do no wrong in my eyes!"
Haruhi,2h7do4,twinfyre,4,Wed Sep 24 20:07:07 2014 UTC,That is some really messed up logic there.
Haruhi,2h7do4,markypoo4L,4,Wed Sep 24 20:14:13 2014 UTC,I really hope you're just trolling cause u soundin like u got some mental problems
Haruhi,2h88wt,GVSDSV,10,Tue Sep 23 13:58:53 2014 UTC,"I've watched both, and yeah it was worth the time.  In my opinion, Haruhi's jap VA is better than the dub's, but Crispin Freeman fits Kyon way better than Sugita."
Haruhi,2h88wt,3ggu,9,Tue Sep 23 14:20:31 2014 UTC,"Both are good. I prefer the dub because of Crispin Freeman, but the sub's good as well"
Haruhi,2h88wt,626b,2,Tue Sep 23 15:17:38 2014 UTC,I exclusively watch the dub. Simply because Kyon. I've seen it too many times to switch now.  Do what you like. Both are excellent (though I can't stand Kyon's JP VA).
Haruhi,2h88wt,Kafke,1 point,Wed Sep 24 19:09:49 2014 UTC,"I've only watched the dub, and I feel you. Next time I watch the whole series I'll make it the sub."
Haruhi,2h88wt,jereddit,1 point,Tue Sep 23 16:08:09 2014 UTC,"For some animes, it is a very good idea to watch it subbed (azamanga dioh, I'm looking at you). Sometimes the dub is a really good quality, and the subject matter can be a bit tricky to keep up with, in which case I would recommend the dub (death note, ghost in the shell)  In the case odd Haruhi, I have found that it is pretty easy to keep up with the content (excluding perhaps yuki's overmind spiel), and the dub is a good quality.  So I would suggest you go with whatever you feel comfortable with."
Haruhi,2h88wt,Pentbot,1 point,Wed Sep 24 00:45:51 2014 UTC,"I started out watching the dub, and can't go back to the sub, just because of Crispin Freeman (Kyon) and Johnny Young Bosch (Koizumi)."
Haruhi,2h88wt,EmpressHaruhi,1 point,Wed Sep 24 03:22:33 2014 UTC,"I watched the sub, and now I'm rewatching it dubbed (this is what I usually do when rewatching). Personally I think that overall the sub is better, but that's not to say the dub isn't great as well."
Haruhi,2h88wt,KorStonesword,1 point,Thu Sep 25 13:26:47 2014 UTC,"Watched both dub and sub. But overall I personally enjoyed the sub better because Aya Hirano does a great job in voicing Haruhi. While I agree that Crispin Freeman does a great Kyon as well, Haruhi's voice in japanese just fits so much better with her personality.. and the songs, her singing perfectly suits her. Man, I love Aya Hirano's voice."
Haruhi,2h88wt,radioactivfishy,1 point,Thu Sep 25 20:04:31 2014 UTC,"They're both fucking solid, imo. I started with the dub, and loved it. Kyon's English voice actor honestly sold me on the show so just for him, it was worth watching. I also actually really liked Nagato's VA too. Haruhi's was alright, probably a bit better in the Jap ver, but it's all just perspective anyhow."
Haruhi,2h4knt,gcr,5,Mon Sep 22 14:03:54 2014 UTC,"I've always figured the story was from future Kyon just recollecting since there are a few past tense segments like that including the opening in the first book. I don't really think its a therapist he's talking to, just a general narration from future Kyon."
Haruhi,2h4knt,DevoutHaruhiist,0,Mon Sep 22 14:35:21 2014 UTC,"Maybe not, but it would make sense this way."
Haruhi,2h4knt,Taiboss,1 point,Mon Sep 22 15:58:09 2014 UTC,Put it to the others.
Haruhi,2h4knt,Rein3,1 point,Mon Sep 22 16:57:37 2014 UTC,"My theory is, after reading the last novel, that Kyon actually has Haruhi's powers. Any girl he likes has his powers, because he doesn't want to live in the dark (not knowing about everything that's going around), he wants to be the normal guy who gets to live all the crazy adventures. That would explain why Sasaki lost her powers!"

I may have voted against her, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Group B: Homura. Anyone who can go through that deserves a win.  Group C: Inaban. Autist-chan a shit.  Group D: Taiga. Watching Bakemonogatari and Shinobou was among the girls that least interested me.  Group E: Kurisu. A great character stuck in a good show with a shit fanbase.  Group F: Minori. She was it that made Toradora funny.  Group G: Hitagi. Best Monogatari girl i have seen so far, but that could still change. What won't change is that she is my favourite girl.  Group H: Mikoto. Chitoga and Kosaki both a shit, and Yoko felt as if she gradually became unimportant during the show.  Also, OP, Glop, glop."

Haruhi,2gtaml,1tobedoneX,2,Fri Sep 19 04:53:34 2014 UTC,"Well... Yuno Gasai and Minene Uryu are out, so that disqualifies Mirai Nikki; similarly, ALL of the main Clannad Girls are out of the competition, so that makes that invalid. None of the Kanon or AIR girls are in there (If anyone who prepares the Best Girl stuff ever finds this, TAKE NOTE.), so there's that. So, my only choices now are either one of the K-On girls (I don't even know any of them are still in the competition), or any of the Toradora Girls (Taiga Aisaka, Minori Kushieda, and Ami Kawashima). Quite fitting too, as Taiga is up against Oshino ""Nagato Murderer"" Shinobu, so yeah. Any of those work."

Haruhi,2gmfxe,Reference_Dude,1 point,Wed Sep 17 16:02:20 2014 UTC,"<opinions> There are a few shows that have above-average animation, and Hyouka is one of them. It's also funny and clever. The worst thing about the show is that it could have more clever dialogue, Hyouka looks a bit weird and the pace is a bit slow and meandering. So, it's a bit more funny than an average anime and a lot better drawn. And yeah, I'd definitely recommend it. </opinions>"

I ended up watching the first half of season one chronologically, and now I'm making up for it by going back and watching the show in broadcast order.   I'm really enjoying the show so far. While the fanservice can be a bit iffy, the overal story and variety of episodes is staggering. You might see me on this subreddit more often once I've finished the series.   My favorite episode so far is ""day of Sagittarius""."

Better than wearing small shoes and risking breaking your feet if you're in the mosh pit or jumping and someone jumps on your feet/leg, which if you're going to a crazy concert it WILL happen and you WILL hurt your feet.

When anyone ever complains about the Endless Eight arc, I always ask, ""Well, what other material could they have done with those episodes that wouldn't have happened after Disappearance, canonocially?

It probably is."
Haruhi,2fqr7d,Stormfly,2,Mon Sep 8 19:25:49 2014 UTC,"I really liked it.  I watched it straight after Haruhi and the Girl who Leapt Through Time, and right before Madoka Magicka.  Time loops. So many time loops..."
Haruhi,2fqr7d,Stormfly,3,Mon Sep 8 19:31:28 2014 UTC,"the Girl who Leapt Through Time   Don't make me remember. I was so dissappointed by that film. Some of the ideas were interesting, but right after watching it I distinctly remember telling a friend of mine  ""It's like nothing happened at the end.""  It's seems Kyon: Big Damn Hero has spoiled me so much, in terms of Harems, in terms of time loops, in everything.  EDIT: Oh wait, I actually watched the film before Kyon Big Damn Hero and co, and therefor before any of the shows discussed so far."
Haruhi,2fqr7d,Stormfly,2,Mon Sep 8 19:37:18 2014 UTC,"Kyon: Big Damn Hero   I've seen this mentioned before. I might take a look at it sometime. Where is the best place to find it?  As for your opinion on The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, I absolutely adored that film. Your opinion is valid, and I won't hold it against you as basically nothing does happen, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.  I can't explain why I loved it. I guess it just struck a chord. My friend understands me though because he loves The Cat Returns with a similar lack of reasoning."

Haruhi,2faw31,mwzzhang,1 point,Wed Sep 3 06:14:54 2014 UTC,Nagato really shouldn't count...
Haruhi,2faw31,mwzzhang,3,Wed Sep 3 06:19:52 2014 UTC,As someone who never finished Haruhi (want to just haven't had the time) I don't know what you mean by that so I'm just going to say Blue Berry.  I was taking the whole group into account.

Haruhi,2faumq,bazzadwarf,2,Tue Sep 2 22:21:35 2014 UTC,Manga is still good but I reckon the LNs are better.
Haruhi,2faumq,AusBox,2,Wed Sep 3 02:50:14 2014 UTC,"The manga is made for a slighter younger audience than the light novels, and the drawings are rather weird at times. Hardcore fans only read it for the scenes that have not been already drawn by Ito or KyoAni."
Haruhi,2faumq,Taiboss,2,Wed Sep 3 12:36:04 2014 UTC,I bought two of them and they were not as entertaining as the Light Novels. And I am not the reading type of person.

Haruhi,2f97ac,FomorianKing,4,Tue Sep 2 16:26:12 2014 UTC,I haven't read the manga because I have zero interest in the further adventures of fake human Nagato. So this doesn't really excite me--why adapt this instead of adapting more Haruhi? I might give it a look but honestly the whole concept sounds unappealing to me.
Haruhi,2f97ac,NowWeAreAllTom,3,Wed Sep 3 01:34:47 2014 UTC,"I was thinking the same. While I like Yuki as well, I like the emotionless Yuki. Sure the human Yuki was adorable and cute in the movie, but honestly, a whole series dedicated to that is just way too much.  And I heard Haruhi has almost no appearance in this series, I really think this would be boring without her energy and charm carrying the show."

Haruhi,2f97ac,SpaceOri,3,Tue Sep 2 15:08:47 2014 UTC,"Is the art cover Nagato made by different artists? My favorite is the fourth one, the best version, good hight, good mood, should've been on the first volume. The Nagato on the seventh volume is way different."

Haruhi,2f97ac,errantsignal,3,Tue Sep 2 17:27:54 2014 UTC,"No, the article basically says nothing aside from the 2015 announcement, it just goes on about what the series is and what the spin-off is about."
Haruhi,2f97ac,stanthebat,1 point,Wed Sep 3 00:53:28 2014 UTC,"Hmm.  Based on a peek at the first couple pages of the manga, I'd say the cliche density seems to be fairly high.

Haruhi,2f3yv4,kirun,1 point,Mon Sep 1 10:16:48 2014 UTC,Did they ever announce anything after the Haruhi Hunt? people say pachinko but that was announced before
Haruhi,2f3yv4,lalogutz79,2,Mon Sep 1 20:48:30 2014 UTC,"Nope not really :( It annoys me to no end because there were several indications of teasing and foreshadowing but it never came to fruition. They just had that 708th frame and said The End. If that was an implicit nod to Yuki-chan then I'll be mad because after all that effort you would think we would have a nice surprise and they'd at least be straightforward about it. Alas, the site has been down for over a day now and still nothing. Every page related to the Hunt is down as well. The only comforting news is that the Hunting people still own the domain so they can bring Haruhi.com back. Only question is when or even if they'll do it. I thought it kind of funny that if you go to Haruhi.com and look at the tab on your browser you'll still see the H symbol for Hunt. Perhaps that's another implicit nod to something coming soon? I'll still wait and refresh the page occasionally and BELIEVE but right now I'm not so sure the website was taken down for the purpose of bringing it back up to surprise all of us."
Haruhi,2f3yv4,lalogutz79,1 point,Mon Sep 1 21:16:40 2014 UTC,"Yeah all the teasing confused me on what was an ""official"" announcement or if we were all just speculating too much. I still believe in Haruhi."

Haruhi,2f41bg,KeyBlader358,1 point,Sun Aug 31 20:56:50 2014 UTC,We did your OP so fair is fair right?
Haruhi,2f3w2e,Genbodeau,13,Sun Aug 31 20:03:53 2014 UTC,I'm guessing Kyon explained that during the cut
Haruhi,2f3w2e,Egthoridon,4,Sun Aug 31 20:11:14 2014 UTC,Kyon had just explained it all and Haruhi was just clarifying.
Haruhi,2f3w2e,I_am_LordHarrington,2,Sun Aug 31 20:26:29 2014 UTC,"It doesn't seem like something Kyon explained during the scene change to me. The surprise on his face doesn't line up with ""she's reiterating what he already said"" in my opinion.  I've always been under the impression that it's some subconscious remnant, similar to what happened as Endless Eight progressed. In the ""old world,"" Haruhi subconsciously used her powers, and in the world Nagato created, she subconsciously knew that something was off. She knew deep down that the old world once existed, and when Kyon started pushing the right buttons, she started reciting fact after fact of the old world as if it were some recurring dream she'd been having for years.  I could be way off the mark, and someone may need to check the light novel for some clarification, but that's just how I've seen it since the first time I watched the movie."
Haruhi,2f3w2e,Anonymous7056,2,Mon Sep 1 06:06:18 2014 UTC,"Yes exactly, as the others point it the easiest answer is that Kyon just told her that. But it's just as you said, Kyon is talking about it and she interrupts him to finish the idea, and he gets surprised about it.  Your theory about it being a subconscious remnant is not bad. I always thought maybe she dreamed or wished about it in that world."
Haruhi,2f3w2e,Anonymous7056,2,Mon Sep 1 20:16:47 2014 UTC,"That could certainly work, but it'd be odd that she'd be so specifically correct--calling it closed space, for example--if it were something she'd dreamt up as a coincidence.  We really need to check the source to be sure, but unfortunately, I don't have the Disappearance LN to refer to. D:"
Haruhi,2f1f9b,KeyBlader358,3,Sat Aug 30 22:29:07 2014 UTC,Wait. Konata isn't the Queen of Otaku. She's the Empress God of Otaku!

Haruhi,2eyxyy,SpaceOri,5,Sun Aug 31 07:58:21 2014 UTC,"UPDATE: Haruhi won her round (as expected) vs Enju. 3949 - 1682.  Good news: She proceeds to the quarterfinals next week facing off against Iriasviel of Fate/Zero. Easy win again, pretty much.  Bad news: She just lost her lead as the highest votes in her bracket. Holo now holds the record with a 15 point difference. 15!!!  Pretty sure it will be Haruhi vs Holo in the semi-finals. Holo is gaining some momentum recently, if we get too cocky, she might eventually beat Haruhi, so let's do our best and promote our god!"
Haruhi,2eyxyy,radioactivfishy,3,Sat Aug 30 23:12:34 2014 UTC,next is Haruhi vs Irisviel... HAHAHA

Haruhi,2ey19g,goanimals,5,Fri Aug 29 19:28:43 2014 UTC,Another x post from /r/anime. I guess its time to start getting hype. Glad her spin-off is getting its own show too. Love Nagato. Does anyone think if this does well it could lead us to more Haruhi?
Haruhi,2ey19g,QDawg89,7,Fri Aug 29 19:33:17 2014 UTC,"Usually spinoff are a double edge sword. On one hand it's all about making money so if the spinoff makes money the chances of the main series continuing increases slightly. However, usually when the spinoff dies so does the main series. If the spinoff does bad the hopes for a season 3 will be all but lost.    On another side note, rarely do you see a spinoff AND main series playing at the same time or even anytime near each other's air dates. There are exceptions (see a certain magical index/railgun) but I think with the yuki spinoff being announced for 2015 we won't be seeing a season 3 until 2016 or even 2017. At this point ANY news is good news because it means the series isn't dead after all."
Haruhi,2ey19g,soskyon,7,Sat Aug 30 00:22:37 2014 UTC,Lol just watch it become a series of 3 minute shorts like the Lucky star spinoff
Haruhi,2ey19g,markypoo4L,7,Fri Aug 29 20:57:49 2014 UTC,That would be a real tragedy.

Haruhi,2eyr0x,thefierybreeze,7,Fri Aug 29 23:55:06 2014 UTC,why is the Haruhi fanbase also so upsest   For the longest time I was trying to figure out why we'd be upset with lucky star.....
Haruhi,2eyr0x,appropriate-username,3,Sat Aug 30 01:37:36 2014 UTC,Haha i spent ages on that too
Haruhi,2eyr0x,radioactivfishy,5,Sat Aug 30 15:20:08 2014 UTC,Both are animated by Kyoto Animation. Haruhi and Konata share the same voice actors. Both OPs and EDs are sung by Aya Hirano. Lucky Star references Haruhi a hell lot of times.  That's basically it.
Haruhi,2eyr0x,radioactivfishy,-5,Sat Aug 30 07:55:06 2014 UTC,"Ok then, but the plot is still barf to me so im not gonna watch it."
Haruhi,2eyr0x,Taiboss,8,Sat Aug 30 08:54:09 2014 UTC,"Lucky Star's plot is non-existent so I'm not entirely sure what plot you are talking about.  Lucky Star was never meant to be story-driven like Haruhi in the first place. After all, its based on a 4-koma as opposed to Light Novels.  Lucky Star was never meant to be similar to Haruhi because it isn't from the very start. Its a moe-slice of life-comedy show. What do you expect? Aliens, Espers and Time Travelers as well?  The reason why Haruhi fans like Lucky Star is because of the massive amounts of Haruhi references it gives, and not to mention, the MC is a Haruhi fan herself so it makes it somewhat relatable.  We like Lucky Star not because its similar to Haruhi (which isnt). We like Lucky Star because it pays homage to one the greatest shows ever made.   So if you can't respect that, at least stop bashing the show just because you didn't enjoy it compared to Haruhi. Lucky Star is doing nothing wrong. Its just being Lucky Star."
Haruhi,2eyr0x,SSB09,4,Sat Aug 30 10:58:53 2014 UTC,>Easter Eggs  Lucky Star is a 24x22 minutes Haruhi advertisement.
Haruhi,2eyr0x,FomorianKing,3,Sat Aug 30 15:52:01 2014 UTC,"I personally enjoy Lucky Star. I like the art style, the characters and the very nonchalant nature of the show. It's not really trying to be anything special, but it still enjoyable to those who want to take a break from other more hectic or plot heavy anime. It's simple, sweet and a cool insight into the lives of a couple of Japanese high school girls."
Haruhi,2eyr0x,Doughnutcake,2,Sat Aug 30 00:07:42 2014 UTC,"Exactly! I can't watch those world-shaking angst-fests to begin with, so Lucky Star is right up my alley."
Haruhi,2eyr0x,otakuman,3,Sat Aug 30 05:54:23 2014 UTC,"Well, Konata does happen to be a huge Haruhi fan..  This is also amusing because Konata and Haruhi are both Aya Hirano/Wendee Lee."
Haruhi,2eyr0x,oshare_banchou,2,Sat Aug 30 06:02:14 2014 UTC,I have no idea. I'm both a Haruhi and Lucky Star fan.
Haruhi,2etz9x,goanimals,2,Thu Aug 28 16:02:13 2014 UTC,I didn't see this here. So. There ya go. X post from /r/anime. Heres another source: Announcement will be Sept 4th.
Haruhi,2etz9x,errantsignal,5,Thu Aug 28 16:05:00 2014 UTC,"Tweet translation:   It's gotten cold all of a sudden and there's more and more people switching to long sleeved shirts.

On the cover is the progressing anime project, ""The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan""!  Hopefully I can give you more information on comics and the cover around tomorrow or so."
Haruhi,2etz9x,SpaceOri,2,Thu Aug 28 16:59:54 2014 UTC,"Is it animated by KyoAni? The art style looks different.  So is the adaptation of the manga Nagato Yuki-chan, right?

Electricity is a small feat compared to all that.  As for phone service, that actually requires phone lines, routing center, etc. And it'd also require someone else to actually answer.  Who'd they call? Not ghost busters.  Not really a plothole when you consider what's actually happening."
Haruhi,2egvjc,Kafke,2,Sun Aug 24 20:45:08 2014 UTC,"Well I mean, electricity and landline phone service should be similar because both rely on there being a wire between the phone/lamp and the telephone switchboard/power generator. We know that since Haruhi couldn't even get a dial tone, that wire was cut -- presumably by the boundary of the closed space -- but the next shot shows them turning on the lights, which means that wire isn't cut, even though it must pass through the same boundary as the phoe line."
Haruhi,2egvjc,Kafke,6,Sun Aug 24 21:13:35 2014 UTC,"There could be a generator on campus. I know community colleges and universities do that. Not sure about how it is in Japan.  But yea, either way the point is that it was all just created/made by Haruhi. I really don't see how it's that big of a problem when there's a lot of other unrealistic things going on (Just Kyon being there, Koizumi somehow 'breaking through', both Haruhi/Kyon going in the middle of sleeping, why at the school?, etc)."
Haruhi,2egvjc,in-sanity,5,Sun Aug 24 21:23:45 2014 UTC,"I think it's funny, that in a show with an ESPer, an Alien, a timetraveler and a girl with godlike powers, you found malfunctioning telephones to be an issue.  I think the real question is how the hell Kyon can treat them all, all the time."
Haruhi,2egvjc,Ichigatsu,3,Mon Aug 25 02:54:06 2014 UTC,"Guess he remembered the story of snow white after all. Potential Spoilers ahead if you haven't got this far...  It's more to do with the closed space is a construct of Haruhi's wishes and, for a lack of better words; subliminal/subconscious desires.   So in this instance she's in a world whereby there is just her and Kyon. Her auto-evolution ability is making a world she desires, so all the normal amenities she's used to are there: electricity, buildings, windows, whatever. But things that aren't there are things you could say Haruhi doesn't consider important, or not considered at-all.  So ultimately you could say the ""inconsistencies"" in the closed spaces are primarily down to Haruhi not wanting, caring, or completely disregarding their existence; thus their functionality (phones not working) or very existence (the world beyond the school gates) are negated... almost as if they were decorations or backgrounds; & all the things that are there exist/function according to her wishes and expectations. Also explaining why the clubroom computer works still. Another really interesting thing to consider here is Nagato and Koizumi's abilities since they were technically able to infiltrate this world, albeit in a limited capacity, to try to help Kyon - just something that people don't always think about since it helps to give you an idea of the extent of their powers versus Haruhi's.   It's clever writing when you think about it, Tanigawa likely knows that he can simply say ""Haruhi did/didn't want it"" for anything people may consider an inconsistency. After all; Haruhi only created the universe 3 years ago, who's to say this isn't the normal one? ;)"
Haruhi,2egvjc,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Tue Aug 26 17:12:35 2014 UTC,"Cell phones use satellites and those probably didn't exist outside that area anymore since Haruhi was focused on that place? I don't know, I'm just guessing. :P"

Haruhi,2e9g8b,radioactivfishy,6,Fri Aug 22 08:46:51 2014 UTC,"That's because he never fell down those stairs. Those are just fake memories that Nagato gave everybody. If Kyon really had fallen from the stairs she could have intervened, yes. But he was actually stabbed by Asakura without Haruhi being there.  So because it never happened, Haruhi couldn't heal Kyon."
Haruhi,2e9g8b,626b,1 point,Fri Aug 22 09:02:13 2014 UTC,"Still doesn't explain why Haruhi wasn't able to wake him up immediately though. I mean, it was implied that Haruhi has been camping there for days right?"
Haruhi,2e9g8b,626b,6,Fri Aug 22 09:05:53 2014 UTC,"We don't know when the hospital stuff started. Maybe after fixing the loop, Nagato healed Kyon, altered reality a bit to get everybody to the hospital and give them all fake memories, and the exact moment everything continues Kyon wakes up."
Haruhi,2e9g8b,Ergoemos,1 point,Fri Aug 22 10:15:45 2014 UTC,"I imagine there is a combination of factors.   For one, Haruhi is a realist. When someone falls down the stairs and remains unconscious, they aren't going to wake up immidiately. She would resist changing the world over night until it looked like Kyon was beyond some point of no return.   Two, no one asked Koizumi how busy he and the organization was those three days, desperately trying to put out shinjin fires day and night to prevent total world collapse.   Three, Haruhi was not working in a vacuum. She was pretty constantmy surrounded by the ineffable Yuki, the execdingy pleasant and ever unflappable Koizumi, and the always optimistic Asahina. Those three knew, via Nagato, that there was nothing to be concernedone about. As worried as Haruhi was about Kyon, she got constant subconscious reminders that there wasn't anything to worry about, which delayed a more immediate and drastic global paradigm shift.  That's my take, at least."
Haruhi,2e9g8b,Kafke,1 point,Fri Aug 22 11:36:13 2014 UTC,"Haruhi would expect someone to be out for a few days if they fell down the stairs like that. Naturally that'd be the case.   It even took days before he wakes up, shouldn't Haruhi's powers manage to fix him up the moment he falls down the stairs?   Not so. As we see in other episodes, her powers seem to have a delay (note the birds changing colors)."
Haruhi,2e6ym1,soskyon,9,Thu Aug 21 16:38:21 2014 UTC,15498 = number of loops in E8.   I believe there were 15532 loops not 15498.  EDIT: Aparently I messed up as in the novels there are actually 15498 loops.
Haruhi,2e6ym1,Arvediu,5,Thu Aug 21 18:40:09 2014 UTC,"Yeah you're right, I didn't think to look up the actual number of loops because it sounded really good when I heard it."
Haruhi,2e6ym1,errantsignal,7,Thu Aug 21 19:04:43 2014 UTC,"However, the first Endless Eight episode was the 15498th loop, so it's not a completely insignificant number.   That said, I think this particular example is more likely an example of finding patterns in randomness... We can find a lot of ""significant"" numbers by rearranging other numbers we happen to find."
Haruhi,2e6ym1,Anonymous7056,3,Thu Aug 21 19:29:47 2014 UTC,"The actual number is 15,498. As in, in the actual story, not the extra episodes conjured up by a third party."

However, I wouldn't throw in the towel just yet. There are some frames on the hunting website that don't technically close until 8/31 which as everyone knows is the last day in the E8 time loop. There was also the case of those 3DPD pictures that were uploaded a few days after the hunt was completed. I think there's still something coming, but you won't hear about it until the end of August."

Haruhi,2e3mv4,TyagoHexagon,3,Wed Aug 20 17:49:27 2014 UTC,"Dissociation and Surprise would work best as a season I'd think, rather than movies. That way they could alternate between timelines with different episodes. It'd get kinda confusing in movie form. :P  I'd also expect season 3 to be 14 episodes and they'd just edit down the longer stories. They've changed a few already."
Haruhi,2e3mv4,DevoutHaruhiist,2,Wed Aug 20 18:39:51 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with Dissociation + Surprise, but I wouldn't mind seeing movies. It would mean Disappearance would no longer be the best anime movie ever made though.  They could, but 14 is WAY to short. The shortest I think they can make a hypothetical season 3 is 16: 1 episode for Love at First Sight, 2 for Snowy Mountain, 5 for Intrigues (and a 6th for the Prologue which is almost its own story) and 2 for Wandering Shadow, with the rest staying the same (maybe cutting one on Editor in Chief or something, but it would be cutting it a lot). A 16 episode season is unheard of unless they make specials like with OreImo. So I'm willing to bet they will push season 3 to a ""short"" 2 season long series rather than a forced 1 season long. I think it is the most logical thing to do, and the one that would make the most sense with the rest of the adaptation. They made the movie almost word by word it seems, so I hope that they will maintain the same production value from here on."
Haruhi,2e3mv4,I_am_LordHarrington,1 point,Wed Aug 20 19:38:39 2014 UTC,"I've always been thinking a similar thing, I didn't work out episodes for S3, but instead of season 4 I would really like to see two or three movies. Hopefully this'll happen, but I doubt it at the minute. KyoAni may resort to something like this if they aren't doing very well financially, or it may happen if the Haruhi hunt that's going on now is to announce S3 (which I'm pretty sure it isn't.)  But fortunately a Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan anime adaption has been greenlit (I've read it thus far and it is basically gold for anyone who is a fan of Disappearance Nagoto x Kyon). Some people may think that this may not do good for Haruhi S3 prospects considering the full cast does make appearances (not telling you how far though) if it sells well then it may mean that S3 is produced."
Haruhi,2e3mv4,flightofangels,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:05:04 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree with you that Dissociation+Surprise could make an excellent 14-episode Season 4. However it seems unlikely to me that a 21-episode season (or any non-14 number) will ever be produced. It's a shame because there are surely 14 episodes of content between the Rampage/Wavering stories and the Indignation stories, especially if Random Numbers were also adapted into an entire episode.  How well do you think Intrigues would work as a movie? Of course, it's the only full-novel story between Disappearance and Dissociation. Yes, it takes place before the Indignation stories. However, Wandering Shadow has the ""classified information"" joke that dovetails with the concept of Yuki envying Mikuru's condition. The Melancholy of Mikuru Asahina is even more explicitly a setup for the themes of Intrigues. If either of these were executed a particular way (the Knowing Me Knowing You in the manga was very different, and of course the anime version of Endless Eight was very different in its emphasis) I feel that an Intrigues movie could work well between Season 3 and Season 4."
Haruhi,2e3mv4,flightofangels,1 point,Tue Jan 27 09:45:41 2015 UTC,"I only put Intrigues in Season 3 simply because I consider it to be the worst story of the LN that were not adapted. It's too slow and nothing really amazing happens. As such, the movie would be far worst than Disapperance and would probably be a flop.  I'm also not a particular fan of making things out of order, but it could work if well adapted enough."

As far as I can tell, it's pretty much the same (though I haven't finished reading all of them yet).  Edit: There's also the disappearance movie (which you didn't mention)."
Haruhi,2dzg6p,potato_dude,-1,Sat Aug 23 00:35:15 2014 UTC,"Yes. Most definitely. But there is a movie that continues after season 2 called The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. I dunno if you've seen it but, if you haven't, you NEED to see it. Because it is LITERALLY THE BEST PART OF THE ENTIRE SERIES!! It will blow you away. No joke.  But to answer your question, yes there are light novels that continue ther Haruhi story. Look at it this way: that Disappearance movie I mentioned is the 4th novel in the series... there are ELEVEN novels out so far. And THINGS GET CRAAAZY. happy reading.

Haruhi,2dnbwq,FomorianKing,1 point,Sat Aug 16 01:24:50 2014 UTC,"Creeping Derengea:       Creeping Derengea, or endoflorescence terribilis, otherwise known as The Creeper or The Green Thumb, is a virus present in Advance Wars: Days of Ruin. It was originally discovered by Dr. Morris. It is a lethal virus, eventually killing off those who catch it. It causes a number of plants and other foliage to sprout on the deceased's corpses. Originally it only affected younger people; however, it later mutates and becomes strong enough to kill older people. Known people infected by the virus are Lin, Isabella (later cured), the mayor, Davis, and possibly Greyfield. Many survivors and NRA soldiers faced firing squads after contracting the virus. The virus was created by Caulder. The flowers of the Creeping Derengea is seen as terrain in the 7th level, Fear Experiment as an alternate type of plains. The effect of the virus is never seen ingame - only in cutscenes. Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Haruhi,2djbg8,thefierybreeze,1 point,Sat Aug 16 15:02:50 2014 UTC,"I like to watch dubbed anime while I animate, because it's a very laborious and slow process. I recently finished re-watching Watamote the dubbed version, so I'll probably re-watch this one as the dubbed version. Though from the little bit I've seen Mikuru's voice is seems pretty annoying in the dub."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Reference_Dude,6,Wed Aug 13 17:17:23 2014 UTC,"I watched it in the order it was released and really liked it. I have always felt that the creators aired it in that order on purpose to convey certain emotions, themes, etc. and therefore if I was going to watch it, that was the way to go.  However I am considering rewatching Haruhi (watched it nearly 6 years ago) and I'm not sure which way I'd rather go about it for a rewatch.  Oh and I watched it subbed, which I recall being very good. Can't speak to the dub's quality"
Haruhi,2dgcyv,TheLastOfYou,2,Wed Aug 13 20:08:43 2014 UTC,"The only thing is i saw this review by GRarkada which is how i found the show and he said the broadcast order builds up to something awesome but is confusing in it's own right. I normally love huge buildups and such, as i loved higurashi and clannad after story. So i was leaning towards that but since most people are saying chronological is better i think i'll wait and see for the rest of the day to see what the prevailing argument in this thread is and i'll start tomorrow."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Doughnutcake,5,Wed Aug 13 17:22:54 2014 UTC,"Hey man, every time somebody asks this question on this subreddit, I always insist on the same thing.  At the very least, first watch the broadcast order of season 1.  Let me tell you why (while trying to not spoil anything).    If you look at the chart/table that /u/DrRad put up, you'll notice that there is actually a method to the madness that is 2006 broadcast order.  If you notice, the episodes that are called ""The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" are all in order, but have been split apart.  This is what is important.  I believe that season 1's plot is basically what is found in these 6 episodes, and when you get to the very end of broadcast order, Melancholy VI, you will definitely feel fulfillment that chronological order would not give you.  All the other episodes are more or less ""slice of life"" filler that provides pacing to the true plotline.  None of the other episodes are really related, except for the 2 parts to Remote Island Syndrome.   I am one of those people that /u/Taiboss is referring to.  I will defend broadcast order until the last bullet.  If you want more explanation, I will provide it.   edit:  As for sub vs dub.. Honestly, the sub has a great cast.  Aya Hirano, Tomokazu Sugita? aww yiss"
Haruhi,2dgcyv,radioactivfishy,3,Wed Aug 13 17:47:36 2014 UTC,"Is it too late to give an opinion?  While I agree that the Broadcast order may be confusing at parts, I really recommend to watch it this way. This guy and his post (The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya and how it blew me away) made a good explanation as to why the broadcast order is the right way to enjoy Haruhi.  Oh, and regarding Endless Eight, watch it. All of them. It may be hard, but you yourself said that you prefer buildups. Actually completing the whole of Endless Eight will make you appreciate the movie even better and understand how the characters felt.  English Dub vs Sub? Its a matter of preference. I say watch both Episode 1's of each and see which you prefer. I watched them in sub first, but I rewatched them in dub afterwards and I am equally impressed by it. Not to mention the song covers they did in the School Festival performance is very impressive."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Taiboss,1 point,Wed Aug 13 23:02:54 2014 UTC,">GRarkada   Fuck. That was released last December, right? Fuck I feel old."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,goody153,3,Thu Aug 14 07:11:44 2014 UTC,Refer to DrRad's image link ..  watch it in broadcast order  .. chronological order doesn't build up suspense and if you are worried that it might be confusing..   don't worry it's not even that hard to figure out .. the show is not some godtier scifi that is insanely confusing  it's like 10 times easier to figure out than the likes of baccano or durarara. So i think you'll be fine  go for sub over dub but it is understood that you go for dub on this one .. the dub was not bad at all
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Taiboss,1 point,Wed Aug 13 18:44:14 2014 UTC,"The English dub is good, but both are excellent in their own way.  This is also true for the orders. Both are good, both have their pro and cons, you fill find people who will defend both till the last bullet.  Flip a coin, use a RNG, do anything that takes the decision away from a human, because the bias in this topic is terrible."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Gzalzi,-4,Thu Aug 14 08:49:34 2014 UTC,"The English dub is good   Haha no. While the casting for Kyon is spot on, the rest of the show is terrible whiny women trying to sound like children just like every other bad dub."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,Taiboss,5,Wed Aug 13 17:23:33 2014 UTC,"Dude, you just said something, which is like insulting Steins;Gate on /r/anime or insulting Zelda OoT on /r/gaming. Get out while you can."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,BobTheJoeBob,1 point,Wed Aug 13 18:33:44 2014 UTC,"I can't comment on the dub since I haven't watched it, but I'd definitely say to watch it in chronological order. The broadcast order serves no purpose other than to confuse. Even the light novels didn't have that pointless order, so why should the anime? I really don't understand why they did it."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,thephotoman,1 point,Wed Aug 13 18:42:49 2014 UTC,"Go with the sub. I'm a broadcast order guy, myself.  S1's pacing is better that way."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,anoneko,0,Wed Aug 13 17:25:51 2014 UTC,"The show is so good that you watch it at least two times, first in release, then chronological.  Watching dubs is extremely pleb though, with absolutely no exceptions. Seiyuota masterrace will confirm."
Haruhi,2dgcyv,626b,-1,Thu Aug 14 02:28:57 2014 UTC,"I say go with the dub. I always watch sub, but there are a few series that are better in dub. To me, those are Hellsing Ultimate, Black Lagoon, Baccano and Haruhi. Kyon's English voice is great, the rest of the cast is alright. I say start with the dub, and if you don't like the voice actors of the other characters, switch to sub. Then for the order, pick what you like best. Chronological is best to understand, but it will have all the episodes that are more focussed on explanation all in the beginning, after which you'll get the adventures. The ""big end"" will come fairly soon, which may feel wierd. Broadcast order is more confusing, but also gives the show more mystery to it. The big revelations will come at the end. I prefer broadcast myself.  But whatever you do, watch The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina episode 00 first, it's the best way to start this series"

Haruhi,2dcx7w,Kafke,2,Wed Aug 13 01:22:31 2014 UTC,"Making it exactly /r/naut is literally as simple as copypaste but 1) I turn that theme off in every subreddit where it is used because it wastes a large amount of space and is very bland and 2) it has nothing to do with Haruhi and I am kinda terrified of /u/suzumiyaharuhi's reaction if we removed anything Haruhi-related in our CSS--I'm still tiptoeing around her ever since I replaced the background with Yuki (and I only assume our world is still here because I replaced the logo with Haruhi at the same time).   I'd be willing to contribute images for the banner, logo or even for comment flair   Make another post with the images, if the community likes them more than the current ones (and if they don't look bad when they are the same size as the logos that are up there now) I'll replace 'em. As for comment flair, I was completely hooked in making that when I was working on it, so fair warning there, but I'll add anything you want me to, just tell me what you want people to type [](/here) when they link the image."

It's not necessarily a plot hole so much as an established literary device.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_paradox  However, I guess this is a little different in that Kyon knows that he'll need to eventually go back in time to save his ass, but it's still the same idea."

It exists when a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that ""predestines"" or ""predates"" him or her to travel back in time. Because of the possibility of influencing the past while time traveling, one way of explaining why history does not change is by saying that whatever has happened must happen. This means either that time travelers attempts to alter the past in this model, intentionally or not, would only fulfill their role in creating history as we know it and not change it or that time-travelers' personal knowledge of history already includes their future travels in their own experience of the past (for the Novikov self-consistency principle).

Haruhi,2d446f,Phil9977,2,Sun Aug 10 06:37:35 2014 UTC,"It's One of the Most common time-paradoxes out there but I THINK you can kinda explain it here. so the theory is that the loop had to start somewhere / somewhen and because of Kyon dying that's impossible because the ""first"" kyon DID die. There is one fact that may explain how it works tho.  The One who is capable of traveling through time is NOT kyon himself, it's Mikuru!   So my explanation would be: The very first Kyon was saved by Mikuru and Nagato (without Kyon being there). When they saved him they Started the timeloop with him coming with them to save himself.  That still doesn't explain why he would travel back with them after this but atleast it makes everything a lil bit less ""paradox""  TL;DR: The Timetravel-Device is used by Mikuru, not Kyon.  Hope that somewhat helps ^  EDIT: I just thought about it again and realized they would have to be in the ""normal"" world to Do that, and they simply are not there it the first kyon dies. so everything written above is pretty much Bullshit :3"
Haruhi,2d446f,P-man,1 point,Sun Aug 10 02:38:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah the ""first event"" i think it's called, or was it true event? fuck it who knows, trying to remember a talk from one of my physics lecturers here on time paradoxes.   anywhos; In terms of changing the past you can't think of it as outcome 1 and outcome 2. Essentially, both would be impossible since you need the initial event to spark a divergence (a similar paradox to the chicken and the egg). So you have to dive into multiverse theories to be able to make any of it possible... ugh :( stay with me...  Basically speaking there are an infinite number of possibilities all occurring at once, and the ""true event"" is actually just one of the many possibilities that can occur, not by any means the ""correct"" event.   So when you got up this morning, and stubbed your toe on the desk. You decided to go back in time, and a limping version of you stopped the previous you from stumbling into your desk thus preventing a bruised toe. But now consider there's also a version of you that did not stub your toe, and decided to be an asshole; went back in time to push the previous you into a desk thereby stubbing his toe. Both timelines result in (nearly) the exact same results but a different path the reach them. now spend literally just 2 minutes considering the millions of different possibilities and the vastness of the outcomes... time travel and time paradoxes make for good story telling, but in reality (if you can call mathematical speculation a reality) you can only really cover a small area before it turns into a cluster fuck.  tl;dr: loads of out possible time lines, you only witnessed one variant (hence the mind-fuckery of time theories).   know whats funny, this talk with our physics professor got brought on by someone asking something about Steins;gate, turning an otherwise boring lecture on electromagnetism into quite an entertaining philosophical discussion... whats scary is there's technically a timeline that exists where that student did not bring this up and we all died of boredom :/"

Haruhi,2cyw4l,Ergoemos,9,Fri Aug 8 10:29:17 2014 UTC,"To be honest... I can only imagine two options that are possible, neither of which is season 3.   My first guess is that they are trying to hype up for the Disappearance of Yuki Nagato-chan anime announced at the end of last year. Why are they using this almost completely unrelated material? I'd say it was a previously unused promotional event that had been sitting around in storage. They had all the images and said ""eh, why not use it now?"" Cheap interactive hype to get everyone back into the fandom.   The only other reason I can think of them doing this is to announce a live action something or other for the show given the live action extra bits. Not sure how I feel about that.  Pure conjecture, of course. No evidence for my opinion."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,Evilsbane,2,Fri Aug 8 14:14:01 2014 UTC,"I am more guessing the first one, not only was the girl who picked up the picture Yuki, but Yuki Nagato-chan manga spoilers."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,soskyon,4,Fri Aug 8 20:05:57 2014 UTC,"I think that's still a bit of a stretch... Why is the campaign titled ""Haruhi Hunting"" and not ""Yuki Hunting"" and furthermore the scenes don't have anything to do with memories or really anything profound. It's just a music video, but Haruhi is at the center as usual. In all honesty, as much as more info on a Yuki anime would be great, I would rather have more Haruhi. Unless they're being cheap mofos and hyping yuki anime under the haruhi name which is shameful."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,Evilsbane,5,Fri Aug 8 22:45:56 2014 UTC,"I absolutely think they would be cheap mofos as you state. Yuki is great, but Haruhi is the face of the franchise."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,Kafke,3,Fri Aug 8 23:17:35 2014 UTC,"That seems like it. If I had to guess, it's probably for the Nagato anime. Lost Memories, ""It is completed"", along with the little bit of Nagato at the end there. That's what it's pointing to.  A live action thing is also possible, but I really don't think it's likely."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,mando777,2,Fri Aug 8 21:14:33 2014 UTC,"Wasn't the end of the segment on haruhi.com filmed live action? Probably totally unrelated, but I was somewhat thinking the same thing as your second comment.   Which I would be totally fine with. New Haruhi material is new Haruhi material, so I'm not complaining one bit. I'm somewhat interested to see how they would do it anyway (if that's what is going on)."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,autowikiabot,9,Fri Aug 8 19:20:14 2014 UTC,a friend of mine just pointed out that #708 is the apartment number Yuki lives in...  source: http://haruhi.wikia.com/wiki/Yuki_Nagato
Haruhi,2cyw4l,Smilelele,4,Tue Aug 12 23:59:14 2014 UTC,"Yuki Nagato:       According to Yuki, she was created three years prior to meeting Kyon and Haruhi, with the purpose of observing humanity and its ability to evolve in intelligence, and more importantly, Haruhi Suzumiya and the data flare that she created around that time. To Yuki, Haruhi is the key to evolution. Yuki is stationed in an apartment complex where several other Humanoid Interfaces are implied to live, in room 708, alone. Yuki remains in standby mode until ""Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody"", when a future version of Mikuru and Kyon come to visit her, telling her that they are from three years later and require her assistance to return to their time. After synchronizing with her future self, Yuki confirms them as acquaintances, and puts them in a room for three years, freezing time within in order to help them return. Meanwhile, another future Mikuru and Kyon come, informing her that in three years the world will be altered and that she needs to help them. Knowing that she is the one responsible for changing the world, she gives Mikuru and Kyon the tools needed to change her astray self back to normal.Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

After the 707th it zoomed out, showing that they were on Haruhi's Desk all the time. Then it zooms out even further, revealing that the whole UNIVERSE was in fact on the 708th Card. In the end I guess Haruhi takes the Card with her (because she's a god, and she can do whatever she wants to the universe)  I have NO IDEA if this should hint at something but the concept amazes me :D"
Haruhi,2cyw4l,appropriate-username,8,Fri Aug 8 11:09:27 2014 UTC,"I guess Haruhi takes the Card with her   The last line (kore de kansei) was said in Yuki's voice so I think that's who took the card. It was also taken fairly gently and with minimal movement which supports that theory.  Judging by the bonus footage at the end, I'm all hyped for a haruhi live action movie now.  Also, kansei has way too many meanings..."

And I dunno, take a random japanese page: http://item.rakuten.co.jp/dondon/yd-001/?s-id=top_normal_rk_seasonal  That box in the middle has like a 1:1 ratio of kanji vs hiragana. In my (admittedly, probably as limited as your) experience, the Japanese tend to put just enough hiragana in a word/sentence  for people to kinda see a part of it but to utterly screw over anybody who doesn't know kanji. It's like the biggest language tease of all time.   It's honestly probably easier to just wait until there's a VR app that converts kanji to hiragana on the fly, if there isn't one already."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,DehydratedMango,2,Sat Aug 9 11:55:45 2014 UTC,"When I say barely passed, I mean in the middle of the semester I was pulling a low D, but got my shit together and pulled it up. Was hard, but I somehow did it.   Well, way before I was ever into anime (we're talking at least 15 years+), since I was a kid I've always wanted to travel to a foreign country and teach English. Back then it was a 3 way tie between Spanish, German, and Japanese. I had no way of learning these languages without hiring a private tutor since my middle and high school didn't offer these languages. So now that I'm in college I have the chance to make that dream a reality.  Every Spanish class in my area is filled up to over maximum capacity (due to my location, very heavy Mexican-American area, so there's no chance of me ever getting into a Spanish class), so since I actually have a lot of German blood in me I thought that's what it was going to be.   Surprisingly enough, the German class at my uni was full too. Maybe because I registered late as fuck, but that's another story...so Japanese it was. Nowadays I have another incentive behind it, but it's not purely based off of anime. The Japanese have a deep culture spanning over 1000 years, so I would want to research that in the future. And if the Chinese language wasn't CRAZY HARD to learn, I'd love to travel there and visit all the Imperial relics that still stand from 2000 years ago.   Eventually I do plan on learning German but that's a while away.   ninja edit: Sorry for giving my life story, it kinda just came out hha"
Haruhi,2cyw4l,PornTacticStan,2,Sat Aug 9 20:37:14 2014 UTC,"I had no way of learning these languages without hiring a private tutor   So far, I have found the following:   A textbook. Good for grammar, bad for vocab Japanese lessons on tape. Good for vocab, bad for grammar. www.memrise.com. Good for vocab and kana, nonexistant grammar. Talking with Japanese people. Bad for vocab, bad for grammar, good for not being a NEET and helping others. Anime. ?????? Good for cementing particular words I guess.   There is also www.japanesepod101.com and Japanese children's comics that have hiragana under the kanji but I haven't tried those yet.   ninja edit: Sorry for giving my life story, it kinda just came out hha   It's ok, I like reading others' perspectives on life."
Haruhi,2cyw4l,soskyon,2,Sat Aug 9 21:05:32 2014 UTC,"I tried learning without a tutor/teacher a while ago, but I just couldn't. There were too many inconsistencies/questions I had pertaining to things, but now that I have a solid base in the language, maybe after this semester (Japanese 2) or the next, I can save some money and do some self study.   I learned a fuck ton of Japanese from anime haha, though most of it was:   Kawaii, sugoi desu, onii-chan, kakkoii, baka, etc...   Joking aside, I actually learned the basic structure of sentences from anime, but taking a Japanese class solidifies and truly ""instructs"" the language. For me at least, I'm sure there are a ton of people who could have picked it up way easier than I did haha"

The card we all saw showed a specific place in Japan on Earth. When the card fired a beam it communicated something to the other card. The other card was in a distant place outside of Earth. It never showed where or even what planet the other card was on, but it did show our universe....or atleast the outside of it. We already know that Yuki could create an alternate universe. But what if the Thought Entity made a different one. At the end it sounds like they say Kore de Kansai. Well Kansai does refer to a place in japan and if you look at when they zoom out Kansai is near the same place as in the movie. Perhaps the Thought Entity is going to act independent of the other organizations and try to force changes on Haruhi's life. Perhaps they are making one without Haruhi, or perhaps the creators of the show are going to try some kind of spinoff with a similar setting but different situation.   Either way I hope it's something interesting like I said. I know it sounds  a little far fetched, but when I read all the other comments it saddens me to think that the answer is so simple and boring.

Haruhi,2cyamr,Wakkawazzalo,3,Fri Aug 8 04:31:40 2014 UTC,"Human Nagato did nothing. Alien Nagato changed the universe and 'died' that exact moment giving birth to human Nagato. It's a part, but the relationship between Nagato and Mikuru goes deeper than that. Nothing happened. It is never stated, but I support the theory that after/while fixing time, Nagato fabricated memories for everyone so that it worked. Kyon was there because he was stabbed. He never fell down any stairs."
Haruhi,2cyamr,Taiboss,1 point,Fri Aug 8 11:40:51 2014 UTC,"Ahhhh, that makes a lot of sense. That didn't even occur to me! Is their relationship more detailed in the light novels or where is that coming from? I'm guessing that there is a lot of theory surrounding the ending then?    Thanks for the detailed response!"
Haruhi,2cyamr,mando777,2,Sat Aug 9 04:09:10 2014 UTC,"here is my take on it... though I might be horribly wrong.  As you saw in Endless 8, Nagato has been on the side as an observer for a very long time, Endless 8 threw her into an infinite loop, while other people got their memory reset after each loop, Nagato's didn't. This is what caused the major event in Disappearance. Too much junk and errors built up in Nagato's system and she broke down. Part of her wants to become a normal person and create a new world, but her logical side made her create the ""keys"" to undo this, and handed the ultimate decision to Kyon. It was not the human Nagato who altered the universe, she just turned into one as a result. Human Nagato has no idea what happened.   as for the relationship between Mikuru and Nagato, I am not exactly sure why adult Mikuru is nervous around Nagato, my guess is something that has yet to happen.  We do not know who pushed Kyon down the stairs, or if he was even pushed. There are many different speculations as to what happened."
Haruhi,2cyamr,sirbob6,1 point,Fri Aug 8 05:18:01 2014 UTC,"I was looking on other forums about the movie and your view about the endless eight's toll on Nagato seemed to be accepted and I feel like it makes a lot of sense also. I love how much attention the writers gave to nagato in the film and the foresight of the endless right episodes. I couldn't imagine living those two weeks 15,000 times over. I had trouble after four haha."
Haruhi,2cyamr,Ergoemos,2,Sat Aug 9 04:19:56 2014 UTC,"Kyon's monologe at the 2hr 4min mark explains Nagato's reason for Nagato doing what she does. To my understanding, the powers she has is inactive/nonexistant when she is human. As for the changing space/time, she does that while alien and becomes human afterwards. No idea, I just assume Nagato creeps her out because she isn't human and quiet and such. They explain it in Intrigues spoiler"
Haruhi,2cyamr,Taiboss,2,Fri Aug 8 08:48:14 2014 UTC,"More on point 2:  Remember, Mikuru is from the future and as such, she has a completely different perspective on time than the others. For her, most events are relatively immutable, unchanging, unyielding. Haruhi is an externality, one that time travelers are well aware of and watch closely.   Nagato was not someone or something they had been necessarily aware of as a threat to the space-time continuum. Nagato erased all of the future, rewrote all memories, and effictively recreated a whole new world. And Mikuru could do nothing to change that. Haruhi was a known, relatively stable threat (They need Haruhi to help Spoiler Title after all.)  Nagato actually enacted the powers, destroying all time planes that time travelers existed on, to create a world of her choosing.   I'd be a little nervous of the unknowable starfish alien who destroyed and recreated the universe, rewriting my entire life in a flash too, if I had to deal face it."
Haruhi,2cyamr,Ergoemos,1 point,Fri Aug 8 23:39:13 2014 UTC,THIS. I was sitting there watching Mikuru's face and they seemed to really exaggerate her discomfort. But this makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the clarity!

And at the very last episode the show will start off like a season one episode and you'll see Haruhi, Koizumi, Mikuru, Nagato, and they spend the whole last episode prepping for the big reveal of the project. And soon the moment of triumph comes, what we have all been waiting for, Haruhi pulls of the cloth covering something and then it is revealed..........A Pachinko machine"
Haruhi,2cqq5q,Kafke,3,Wed Aug 6 04:10:34 2014 UTC,That sounds wonderful. 12 beautiful episodes of Nagato reading. I'm just hoping that more characters than just Haruhi burst in. Otherwise that'd be a bit disappointing.
Haruhi,2cqq5q,KinRagamine,3,Thu Aug 7 03:40:27 2014 UTC,Is it bad that I actually want this as a shirt?
Haruhi,2cqq5q,fb39ca4,1 point,Thu Aug 7 02:43:52 2014 UTC,"I just downloaded the video (http://haruhi.com/data/movie/output.mp4), and that frame seems to be blanked out."

Haruhi,2cr2mi,AusBox,6,Wed Aug 6 04:15:23 2014 UTC,"And this is what happens when you don't fact check; you turn into Fox News. Also, hopes and dreams ruined"

Haruhi,2cnly6,sirbob6,7,Tue Aug 5 03:39:02 2014 UTC,that was beautiful.
Haruhi,2cnly6,SleepyShinji,4,Tue Aug 5 05:03:42 2014 UTC,That's it? It just.... cuts off like that? Does the same thing if you actually just go to haruhi.com and watch it there.
Haruhi,2cnly6,Kafke,3,Tue Aug 5 07:04:06 2014 UTC,Is it completer though? It only said 706 frames at the end. I don't believe all that hype was just for that.
Haruhi,2cnly6,KokoaKuroba,5,Tue Aug 5 11:47:30 2014 UTC,"Last night there was some chatter about the actual number of frames being 777. Which makes a certain amount I sense, given that the 707 version seems incomplete. Maybe there's some revelation in the last 70 frames?"
Haruhi,2cnly6,NowWeAreAllTom,1 point,Tue Aug 5 12:32:58 2014 UTC,Orrr maybe this is just a clip from an episode of season 3? That'd be nice.
Haruhi,2cnly6,CrashingForeignCars,1 point,Tue Aug 5 17:05:48 2014 UTC,"Nope all 707 were found legitimately. There was some weird misunderstanding for a while, but everything is good to go. The full video is what was linked. That's technically what was shown before as well, just with missing frames.  I'm pretty sure there'll be an update that reveals something. Otherwise that'd be a bummer."
Haruhi,2cnly6,Kafke,1 point,Tue Aug 5 19:56:48 2014 UTC,Check out frame 356.
Haruhi,2cnly6,Bloodyfart,1 point,Tue Aug 5 22:36:53 2014 UTC,I thought it was actually legit though? Or was frame 356 specifically not? I thought the actual one was eventually found?
Haruhi,2cnly6,Kafke,2,Wed Aug 6 05:04:18 2014 UTC,"Nope. It was originally a badly forged frame (they just interlaced the previous and proceeding frames together) that was rejected almost immediately. However, the submission released a clean version of real frame. This was then edited to include the QR codes and number and resubmitted a few times. It was eventually accepted and the movie was unlocked."
Haruhi,2cnly6,Kafke,1 point,Wed Aug 6 05:24:19 2014 UTC,Huh. So I guess that means that it's not going to be revealed just yet? I wonder how long we'll have to wait...
Haruhi,2cnly6,Spazzo965,7,Wed Aug 6 06:09:33 2014 UTC,"So that's the deal with there being times of 1 comment, but no actual comment."

Haruhi,2cnv5m,EL_Horse1,2,Tue Aug 5 18:38:59 2014 UTC,"see what bothers me is that the pachinko game was already released last month, I don't know why they would make a big ass campaign like this to promote that still... I get that the hints they give for frames lead to a webpage where you can get more info but it's hard for me to believe that this whole hunting game is strictly centered around pachinko. There's gotta be something bigger behind the scenes.... and I have a feeling we'll find out if that's true or not very soon"
Haruhi,2cnv5m,EL_Horse1,1 point,Tue Aug 5 19:06:55 2014 UTC,i agree that they wouldn't bother on a campaign like this for a pachinko game. i think they have something big ready to announce like season 3. the music video is focused on haruhi as the main character so chances are that it isn't about the disappearance of yuki nagato anime.
Haruhi,2cnv5m,fatblackninja,1 point,Tue Aug 5 20:35:07 2014 UTC,"Well I fell for it. Got modmailed with the information and even changed the sidebar and everything. Welp, time to change it back."

But no one knows what this announcement is about. However, the most likely scenario is its just something related to the Pachinko game released alongside the Haruhi Hunt, but there are some speculation that season 3 will finally be announced."

Haruhi,2cg39z,autowikibot,3,Sun Aug 3 02:54:37 2014 UTC,"A little while ago the website www.haruhi.com was changed to reflect what it currently is.   There was some announcement in a magazine or on the website that 707 images with QR codes will be put up all over Japan - on the web, in magazines, billboards, bus stops, etc. People would take pictures of the pictures, scan the codes, and the website would update.   There's video on the website that was all sorts of garbled and muffled before. With each image scanned, one frame of the video/audio was un-shittified, and became clear. And so the hunt was on for all 707 images.  Apparently, when all the images are found and scanned, there will be some announcement regarding Haruhi. We have no idea what that announcement is or even pertains to. Some speculate Season 3 announcement, but the large majority of people think it's just hype for a Haruhi themed Pachinko game. Pachinko is a form of gambling, sort of like slot machines. Mostly chance with a little skill thrown in.   Currently, frames 218, 355, and 356 are the only ones left to find, but 355 and 356 don't seem to have been released into the wild yet. 218 is up to be found, but nobody has found it just yet."
Haruhi,2cg39z,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sun Aug 3 05:41:38 2014 UTC,"Pachinko:       Pachinko (パチンコ ?) is a mechanical game originating in Japan and is used as both a form of recreational arcade game and much more frequently as a gambling device, filling a Japanese gambling niche comparable to that of the slot machine in Western gaming. A pachinko machine resembles a vertical pinball machine, but has no flippers and uses a large number of small balls. The player fires balls into the machine, which then cascade down through a dense forest of pins. If the balls go into certain locations, they may be captured and sequences of events may be triggered that result in more balls being released.  The object of the game is to capture as many balls as possible. These balls can then be exchanged for prizes. Pachinko machines were originally strictly mechanical, but modern ones have incorporated extensive electronics, becoming similar to video slot machines.

Haruhi,2c9oqk,KaiHighInTheSky,8,Fri Aug 1 07:46:51 2014 UTC,"I suck with word type... thingies but here I go.  I think how well the viewers' feelings emulate Nagato's by the end is exactly why the entirety of the Endless 8 was genius.   I'm sure by the end everyone involved wanted to flip a table. Hell, Nagato would flip the friggin' galaxy if she could. Maybe she knew the whole time what the answer was, maybe she didn't. But her programming forced her to just sit and watch. Just like us.   And i think any ending that would have been ""worth the pain"" would have made it not as unique as it is now. All this pain and monotony digging you deeper and deeper into hair pulling frustration only to have this underwhelming solution drive the final nail in the coffin and solidify this whole event in your brain forever. Love or hate Endless 8, love or hate Haruhi, you will NEVER forget this. It will be with you forever. And I believe that is the other part of the genius behind the Endless 8.  It takes major stones to risk pissing off such a huge fanbase. But for the sake of creative liberty, they went for it. And made the Endless 8 all the more moving.  (P.S. Sorry about the wall of text xD)"
Haruhi,2c9oqk,Destroynme,5,Fri Aug 1 01:17:07 2014 UTC,I prefer this ending
Haruhi,2c9oqk,radioactivfishy,5,Fri Aug 1 01:13:12 2014 UTC,"I always wondered why Kyon didn't do what he did during the closed space before to break the loop like Koizumi suggested, but I came up with two reasons why he probably did not.   Reason 1: Of course Kyon didn't want to do it all over again, and this time he was in the real world and he would have to plan out the time place, how to do it, what to say, and what if it made it worse?  Reason 2: Let's say it did end up working well there are two different paths. Path one: Is part of reason 1, if it worked but made Haruhi confused at the sudden display of affection or worried of their future together then it could cause a lot of closed spaces or in the worst case destroy the world. Path 2: Let's say this was what Haruhi wanted and fixed the time loop, well now Kyon has to worry about keeping Haruhi happy as her boyfriend and not only that I'm pretty sure Kyon wouldn't want that kind of future.....or at least not that way. By doing this Kyon risked fixing the time loop problem, but then being stuck with a whole new kind of problem.  I don't know about you guys, but this was what I thought was the problems."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,NowWeAreAllTom,2,Fri Aug 1 02:40:25 2014 UTC,"Now that you have gone through Endless Eight, you would definitely understand Yuki's feelings and what she's been through when you're going to watch the Disappearance.  IMO, the only real purpose finishing all of EE was to understand the movie better.  Also, Kyon-kun denwa.."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,iblessall,2,Fri Aug 1 11:23:37 2014 UTC,"I'm not a big student of animation or visual storytelling but I think it's pretty cool that as you progress through Endless Eight your attention wanders away from big picture things like character arcs or plot developments and you gradually become more and more aware of the teeny tiny little decisions that go into making an animated story. How to frame a shot, how to transition from one scene to another, how to communicate to the viewer what emotions a character is feeling. Stuff like that, when it's working, doesn't tend to draw attention to itself, but I think Endless Eight finds an interesting way to draw the viewer's attention in the direction of the granular details."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,Kafke,1 point,Fri Aug 1 17:28:06 2014 UTC,"I particularly like how in each episode when he says ""How about I say 'I love you' to her"" they never show Kyon's reaction, though it's implied. It wouldn't have been significant normally, but because it was like that every time, it drew attention to it."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,Ergoemos,2,Sat Aug 2 01:39:15 2014 UTC,"I was good from 1-5, and then 6-7 were a bit of a slog and 8 was fine.  It is a fail as a payoff, but you know what it does really well? Gets you inside Kyon's head. If you didn't know what kind of person Kyon was before, you sure as heck do now."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,Ergoemos,2,Sat Aug 2 02:15:57 2014 UTC,"It's not significant. In the novels it was just one tiny chapter that only really covered the last episode.  The anime portrays Yuki's perspective, which builds feels for the movie."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,1tobedoneX,2,Sun Aug 3 03:50:10 2014 UTC,"So, first post on Reddit, and I am replying to something that is five days old. Not bad.   I think that your interpretation of the arc is perfectly valid.   Rationally-wise, There was no reason for Kyo-Ani to animate six identical episodes that add nothing individually to the show. The first and last episode were necessary in that they had unique content, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to have one of the six episodes of ""Oh crap we are trapped, but we can't get out."" So that leaves us with,  ostensibly, five wasted episodes. They could have done so much with those episodes! Emotional impact in the future does not equivocate the outrage endorsed in fans at the time. I don't have any numbers to back me up, but I wonder how many fans, and dollars, they lost during the first airing of those six useless episodes? Tangibly, if they didn't include the five useless episodes at all, stripped them of existence, would the fandom for this show be so divided and meager?   Artistically, those episodes serve a purpose beyond just showing the same events every time. They build a persona of a character. We see Koizumi's investigatory nature, as he is the first to really pin down the problem each loop. We see Mikuru's struggle and distress over being unable to contact the future, which, for all intents and purposes, means the universe has ended for her. We see Kyon's internal fight, every single loop, his struggle to remain passive or step up. We can even see Haruhi's tangible, dangerous need for something more than just what she can imagine, her desire for that one extra step. We see Yuki... well, need I ennumerate what we see there? Does it pay off? In some cases, yes. We see that Haruhi does, in fact, have powers that are far beyond the occasional glitchy image or the ability to create a supernatural cult. We see Kyon grow (a little) and Yuki grow immensely. These were beautiful magical things, for those people who like that sort of thing. It was a gutsy move by any standard, especially in that of anime, which tends towards trying to be as routine as possible.    Practicality-wise, there is an angle that few people consider. What would Kyo-Ani do with those extra episodes? Even if they culled down Endless Eight to its bare minimum, three episodes. Would they have had enough pre-Disappearance material for 5 episodes? I am reviewing the timeline and my memories, and I can't recall much that would need a whole episode. Of the manga extra material that was published early enough to make it to the drawing board, only the ""Knowing me, Knowing you"" story strikes me as interesting enough to actually be worth an episode. They could include the extra bits where Kyon has to hunt down another person infected by the Mysterique Sign, but it was largely filler and adds as much to the story as watching Haruhi's stint in ""Get in the Ring"" showing the High school athletics competition, which is to say, interesting but not much. That's three episodes, if you waste a lot of time and try reaaally hard. They still have two episodes left to fill. Does Kyo-Ani fill those two episodes with their own material? Does anyone remember what happened the last time they did this? If you want to talk about wastes of time… in what way did Someday in the Rain really add to the arcana of Haruhi Suzumiya? Don’t get me wrong, I liked the episode just fine, but there wasn’t much to it. Seeing Yuki isolated, Haruhi be demanding, Koizumi be accommodating and Mikuru being used wasn’t anything new. Maybe there was that bit at the end where Haruhi and Kyon shared an umbrella? I am not sure I would have wanted to see Kyo-Ani make two episodes of whatever, and if they tried to include stuff post-Disappearance of value “Love at First Sight” or “Melancholy of Mikuru Suzumiya”, how would they do this without atonal dischord, without Disappearance to fill in the context?  In short (tl;dr, I believe, is the proper nomenclature), I think that both sides have perfectly valid reasons to think what they do. Endless Eight gives exactly as much as you put into it. That emotional payoff is well worth it to me, but I also get a little impatient by the time I get to the seventh or so episode, and trust me, I have watched those episodes a lot. I am okay with their final product, but mostly because I don’t know what the alternative would be, other than a shortened and less impactful Endless Eight and vignette episodes that would have contained too little content for so much time, let alone having to deal with more real filler, like Someday in the Rain."
Haruhi,2c9oqk,otakuman,1 point,Tue Aug 5 23:41:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah it makes sense. Someday in the rain was okay but did we really need 7-5 episodes of just that if it was shortened? I've heard the main reason was that disapearance was planned to be episodic but the company with the rights to haruhi decided they wanted it to be a movie instead and this left Kyoto in a bad situation. It was an interesting experience, though I think it's better watched in one or two sittings. I could not imagine waiting a whole week each episode for a solid 2 months."

Haruhi,2c5xzu,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 30 22:05:10 2014 UTC,"IIRC, the DVDs are in chronological order but broken up by season. This is the order I originally watched them in (obviously with the exception putting episode 00 in it's proper place).  A lot of fans (myself included) like the chronological (mixed s1/s2 - 2009 broadcast) order. And the DVDs get pretty close.  By the ""real"" order, I'm assuming you mean the original 2006 broadcast order. Which is just season 1, and jumbled up in a weird non-sensical way. Personally I don't like this order as it has no real bearing on the series.  The novels are ordered almost chronologically with some things out of place. Which is partly why I like the chronological (2009 broadcast) order better."

Haruhi,2c1aww,DogOnInternetz,1 point,Tue Jul 29 12:08:48 2014 UTC,"Well written, I agree with a lot of the pieces you brought up, and I think that human relationship and experiencing life are a big theme in the story/show.    I have been reading The Intrigues recently, and I was wondering to myself if Kyon is starting to slip into his complacency a little again.  I think that he definitely took on a more proactive role after The Disappearance, but at the current point in the story he seems to do a lot of grumbling and similar stuff to pre-disappearance.  Perhaps another theme in the story, 'People are creatures of habit'?"

Haruhi,2by14k,AusBox,1 point,Mon Jul 28 16:33:22 2014 UTC,Because the original story is from Tanigawa. I guess they credited Tanigawa anyways but the story of the manga series was written by Puyo.  http://www.mangahere.co/manga/nagato_yuki_chan_no_shoushitsu/

Haruhi,2brpke,batmaster96,11,Sat Jul 26 09:43:34 2014 UTC,"Welcome to the club... we have all been collectively, patiently, gradually-losing-our-sanity, hoping they'll make season 3 for a few years now.  Though with all the stuff happening lately (the Haruhi-hunting, those machine thingamabobs, Aya Hirano returning to voice acting, Yuki-chan anime... et cetera) I'm making a bold claim that hopefully Season 3 is in the works, I would like to say in the next 2 years? but maybe that's just me being hopeful.   To be fair, with all the aforementioned activity; at least it shows Haruhi hasn't been forgotten, i.e. they haven't totally written it off, so we can still hope :3  If you're still hankering a Haruhi fix: get hold of the manga and light novels! they're awesome! :D"
Haruhi,2brpke,P-man,3,Sat Jul 26 19:19:20 2014 UTC,"Other than the announcement of a Yuki-chan spinoff,  there hasn't been any news of a season 3 or anything like that.  Although I would be more than happy if there was a season 3."

Haruhi,2brpke,AesopusDota,1 point,Mon Jul 28 09:30:48 2014 UTC,"There are 12 Light Novels, and the Anime basically only covers the first 4 (if you include the Disappearance movie). (although that's not completely accurate, there are a few short stories from later novels in the anime, and a small part of the anime is original content)  And well there are a few more characters introduced later. I could tell you who they are but I'd recommend just reading the Light Novels yourself."

Haruhi,2bl726,QDawg89,1 point,Fri Jul 25 09:26:40 2014 UTC,The manga and novels pretty much have a set order. Due to me being a mobile user it's difficult to link anything that'll show you the order so I'll let another haruhist do that. What you read first is up to you... I personally think the novels should be read first since they were what both the manga and anime were based off but it's up to you. The good thing about TMoH series is that there isn't much deviation between the three forms so you can skip some novels/manga chapters since you've watched those correlated anime episodes but honestly they're worth reading even when you know what's going to happen.

Haruhi,2b8mg4,Rawr_im_a_Unicorn,2,Mon Jul 21 23:29:29 2014 UTC,I got most of mine through Indigo. Free shipping after $25 and I think I paid about $10 a book. I haven't seen them sold all together but it's easy to just add each one to your cart or wish list. I don't know if they ship worldwide though.
Haruhi,2b8mg4,QDawg89,1 point,Mon Jul 21 00:45:01 2014 UTC,I would try amazon. I think you can find them all there and you'll probably get free shipping if you order most or all of them. I bought a few books (new) for cheap from different sites but most only had one or two in stock. Most of the time I would get them from amazon usually for less than $15 a piece (softcover).

Haruhi,2b4kwa,FomorianKing,3,Sat Jul 19 16:15:55 2014 UTC,My thought process exactly while watching E8
Haruhi,2b4kwa,fatblackninja,3,Sat Jul 19 22:29:37 2014 UTC,"A lot of people say to watch in chronological order but I'm glad you watched the first season in broadcast, because those last couple episodes are best saved for last :) If you could understand the basics of what is going on, then you should be fine watching the second season in broadcast as well, and then top it all off with the Disappearance movie. After that you can come back and watch it all in chronological order and piece everything together if you feel like it."
Haruhi,2b4kwa,jclark1337,2,Sat Jul 19 20:23:43 2014 UTC,"Every single time someone asks this or even talks about this, I have to insist on supporting broadcast order for at least season 1.  I believe season 1 was meant to be watched in broadcast order.  It's pretty much organized chaos.  Melancholy I-VI is the main story of the season, which is why it is still put in the correct order.  I believe that most of the episodes are put in each of their places for good reason.  It's too much effort to explain if nobody is going to read this anyway, but if anyone is interested, I'll explain my thoughts in detail.   But yeah. At least for season 1, broadcast order is the way to go."
Haruhi,2b4kwa,Doughnutcake,2,Sun Jul 20 02:22:26 2014 UTC,I for one watched both orders and i can say.  Broadcast order definitely . It's not that hard to figure to be honest. Even a kid watching the entire show in broadcast order can figure it out what is happening.  Of course there are merits on watching both orders.  Broadcast order: It has rising feeling and the best episode is kinda saved for last which is great as closing episode for season 1. This is something that the chronological order does not offer since the best parts end in like episode 6 and everything else are like filler episodes. So you  are not as motivated to watch further with it.  Chronological Order: You get to closely see the character development which is what broadcast orders doesn't since it's episodic so you can't keep track of it well. And if you are easily confused and can't figure out if it's not on chronological order then there is no harm watching it in chronological order. Seriously it's really easy to figure out.
Haruhi,2b4kwa,goody153,4,Sun Jul 20 11:00:24 2014 UTC,"Many people argue over the ""correct"" viewing order, however if you're watching it for the first time, I suggest watching the series in chronological order. The order is:  *S01 Episodes 2,3,5,10,13,14,4  *S02 Episode 1  *S01 Episodes 7,6,8   *S02 Episodes 2-14  *S01 Episodes 1,12,11,9  *Special: The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya  The alternative order is the broadcast order; the order in which they first appeared on television.  EDIT: The episode numbers above are as written on the TVDB page."
Haruhi,2b4kwa,Tada_Banri,1 point,Sat Jul 19 12:09:16 2014 UTC,"well i goofed up, ive already seen all of season 1 in its episode list order   will that ruin the second season and the movie?"
Haruhi,2b4kwa,DarkMoon000,3,Sat Jul 19 12:16:27 2014 UTC,"Definitely not. The movie comes last in every order. Now that you already watched the first season just watch the second one and use the list Tada_Banri gave you to get when what happens so you are not confused.  But watching it in the original Broadcast order (First Season One, then Season 2, then the Movie) doesn't ruin anything, it's just a little bit confusing but actually it doesn't matter, the episodes don't really spoil each other anyway."
Haruhi,2b4kwa,Tada_Banri,2,Sat Jul 19 13:24:08 2014 UTC,Yes and no... The second season's events take place (chronologically) midway through the events of the first season; and the movie comes after all of that.  The reason why it's usually good to watch the series in chronological order first is because you will find characters in the show that haven't yet been introduced.  You haven't really goofed up; you've just watched the show as it was originally broadcast. I recommend re-watching the series when you're done in chronological order; it's a lot more enjoyable:)
Haruhi,2b4kwa,Kafke,1 point,Sat Jul 19 14:08:36 2014 UTC,Here's the orders. I suggest the 2009 chronological order.

Yuki has had to revolve her whole existance around Haruhi, I mean she was made to observe Haruhi. If you found out your whole point of existance was to observe a teenage girl wouldn't you want out? Yuki was dealing with new found emotions which her programming wasn't supposed to allow. Frustration, boredom, loneliness, and maybe even love and jealousy. Yuki wanted to live a normal life and she may have even had feelings for Kyon. To Yuki Haruhi was nothing more than an objective. Yuki still kept Haruhi, but removed her powers so that her life would not revolve around Haruhi. Maybe it was what Nagato truly desired, or maybe it was her way of crying out for help."

Haruhi,2b3uf4,Evafanboy,1 point,Sat Jul 19 04:36:59 2014 UTC,"Basically, Yuki said ""Fuck You!"" towards Haruhi, and towards all the stress that she was having. All that stress. All that madness, and insanity, made her freak out. Adding the fact that she was growing emotions despite being programmed as an extreme introverted bookworm, coupled with more stress just by being an alien instead of a human, and Yuki displayed the same words she displayed towards Haruhi towards the world.  Hey, it's better than killing yourself."

Haruhi,2aw3ut,Destroynme,3,Wed Jul 16 20:39:01 2014 UTC,"At first I thought ""707"" represented a date, like July 7 (Tanabata day), but the day came and nothing really happened. And it seems the collection of all the parts is going to take some time., meanwhile the pachinko machine is going to debut in six days from now. So these are not related. Initially I thought all this hunting thing were nothing more than Haruhi marketing and advertising for the pachinko machine (which it is actually) but considering the hunt it's prolonging, and looks like a really big effort; I'm clueless about what they are trying to achieve.   For now, we have two certainties:   Confirmed project of ""The Disappearance of Nagato-chan"". (No dates, no studio, no staff still) Confirmed a ""new project"" of Haruhi which will be revealed in the next Newtype in August 4.   The other good signals so far are that all the cast seems fine and back into the ring now (even Hirano and Goto). That Kyoani is actually willing to work the franchise again, and that in January they have room for a potencial new work. They just have Amagi Brilliant Park as a seasonal work (which is going to air this fall), and Free that is already finished I guess; the new Beyond the Boundaries project doesn't count because it's a movie. Even Ishihara is free now that Chu2byo is ended. So... why not?  I choose to be optimistic. I feel it.... Haruhi is in the air again."

Like how she is normal, yet wants to kill God (the part of her that has the powers). The main guy is like a less pessimistic Kyon, Koizumi is the guy who's nice to the main guy, Yuki is Angel, and Mikuru can really be any one to be honest she is one of the most normal ones of the group, and the other characters are people she has encountered. I feel she made them unable to die because she wouldn't want any of her friends to die.

Haruhi,2aoa2s,Rein3,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:11:51 2014 UTC,"But in the end of the 11th Nagaru said he fished the story   ""It is I, Nagaru Tanigawa, who has been a bother. Having filled the extremely big gap since the last novel, I’d like to start with an apology.  This story is a direct sequel to Dissociation, but there aren’t enough words in the Japanese  language to apologize for how late this got here or how long it took. I’d like to give a giant shout of  thanks to all of those involved in the production process, especially the illustrator Noizi Itou and all of  the people involved in the Literature department. I’m sorry I’ve been such a bother to you all. Thank you all very very much.  And from that, for all the readers who have waited a long time for this work without deserting,  I’ve sent ten billion apologies and a hundred billion thanks via the maximum intracerebral electrical  output I can produce in all directions. I hope that it brings you some good luck when it arrives. Haruhi is also kneeling in apology for this author’s shortcomings as if she is hoping for  forgiveness after receiving a body blow.  So this work, The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya (First/Final Parts) is an exact continuation from  the previous work, Dissociation. For those of you who read Dissociation a while ago and have forgotten  things, I’m sorry. Surely re-reading the story you will be a little happier when it’s put together. Ah, I  didn’t want to make this troublesome for everyone who’s received this, but it seems like I’ve gotten  overwhelmed with tears. It’s not so much due to obligations that I’m writing; it’s that I’ve gotten the  privilege to write this down.  Well then as for why this work has been delayed for so long, there’s not really a reason for that.  I’m somewhat embarrassed to confess there’s not one. There’s really no significance or any particular  reason I wasn’t able to write. Honestly, everyday life also became a hindrance as well. I yearned for a  real cause so that I might have been able to claim a few reasons. I had difficulties explaining It to others  so that they would understand because it was a personal issue. I’d say it was a Herculean task.  Again, I can’t give an excuse. For example, my favorite computer kept putting up blue screens  while I was in the middle of writing and it disheartened me or I kept wicked nightmares and would wake  up without any sort of desire to continue writing or lastly I wasn’t affected by the switch from analog to  digital television as I kept watching it were all excuses that I couldn’t say. Humans really have an   abundance of reasons for excuses you know. Maybe some more interesting excuses will become joking  matters. My guess would be that for most of my life my personality trait that I’d been carrying around in  a bag would be “laziness.” I’d progress until I’d casually met my limit. That would probably be the cause  of the delay.  Looking back into the half of my life I’ve lived, I’ve had a history of never being praised or doing  anything spectacular. The only thing I can remember is a memory of failing over in agony like an idiot. I  admire those who can continue to run forward into a concrete wall and shatter their heads into little  pieces. I don’t have that courage in me.  I apologize for polluting your ears while you listen to me reminisce from here. Dating back  several years from now I debuted as a novelist. The exact month that I debuted is a bit fuzzy, but I think  it was around June 10th, 2003. At that time I’m sure I was an incomprehensible bother to the staff at the  Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko and Dengeki Bunko editorial staff. Even now I fret over whether I forgot  something or not. Now as I suddenly remember, I succumb to a desire to run into a concrete wall. Thanks to all of their support, most of my novels were improved from their weak beginnings. By the  time The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and Let's Leave the School became famous, I had already  fallen into the current situation. But how it is right now is enjoyable.  Immediately following The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, I had such a rush of ideas that  were quickly written. With this break, it may have appeared to be that I had stopped writing. It was as if  this me had reached his capacity and was barely grinding anything through. I was worried that people  wouldn’t understand everything. I like to think this stance wasn’t mistaken.  Speaking of Disappearance, the theatrical animation version is something people should see. I  was able to take place in the process of making the film with all the partners. I’m sure I was a bother to  everyone, especially the people who work hard at making words into images at Kyoto Animation whom I  owe a great deal of gratitude towards because they reduced the amount of weight on my end. Words of  thanks can’t feel hap hearted for what I feel towards them after they made Melancholy into an anime  several years ago. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. There is nobody else that makes images like  they can. So adds to the mountain of apologizes I’ve made.  And so I’m pushing my pencil around aimlessly now. To all the readers, I hope you enjoy this  book and that it brings you lots of happiness.  I think I may write a somewhat strange thing and character from here on. I hope to continue  receiving your support. I think the character will have a damaged personality. Now I think I’ll finish the  post-script.  Well then someday, somewhere, and somewhen I hope we’ll be able to meet again.  See you again! ""  So, where exactly does he say this?"

Haruhi,2alocy,DarkMoon000,26,Sun Jul 13 18:48:14 2014 UTC,Yes.
Haruhi,2alocy,BadHaders,1 point,Sun Jul 13 18:53:24 2014 UTC,A simple and short answer. Thx  EDIT:  However I'm glad it's not true
Haruhi,2alocy,ProfessorHooves,8,Sun Jul 13 19:21:47 2014 UTC,"I was annoyed with it at first, but after thinking about it, I realized that it was actually kind of brilliant. As you said,  it gives the impression of being stuck in a time loop. It also allows for us to have a better idea of what Yuki is going through."
Haruhi,2alocy,BadHaders,5,Sun Jul 13 19:35:29 2014 UTC,"Yup, this is the more academical view point! From an artistic standpoint this show did some really interesting things, unfortunately they didn't really help to enhance the viewing experience. Having the episodes in a totally bizarre order when airing them must have been a real pain, and the endless eight really wasn't fun to watch... It was really interesting how it was presented though, with the different camera shots and all the changed tiny little details to demonstrate the butterfly effect that happens each time a tiny thing changes with each loop."
Haruhi,2alocy,Gzalzi,4,Sun Jul 13 20:14:09 2014 UTC,"I agree with this viewpoint but that doesn't mean it isn't a terrible mistake or a waste of time. They could have conveyed the same feeling in 3 or 4 episodes just as easily. It would have still generated controversy, given the same feeling, and been less of a dick move."
Haruhi,2alocy,ProfessorHooves,2,Mon Jul 14 00:18:12 2014 UTC,That was the one thing that always annoyed me with any kind of sci-fi media that made a time loop. It never FELT like one.
Haruhi,2alocy,MarshManOriginal,1 point,Sun Jul 13 19:44:23 2014 UTC,It's never really bothered me before.  It was only after watching Endless Eight that I realized that other stories depicting time loops paled in comparison.
Haruhi,2alocy,Kafke,3,Sun Jul 13 19:48:17 2014 UTC,"Here's the thing, it was a pain to watch. Does that make it somewhat relatable to the pain of going through a time loop? Yes. Does it make an entertaining series of episodes? No, since it's a pain to get through."
Haruhi,2alocy,1tobedoneX,2,Sun Jul 13 22:25:23 2014 UTC,"Depends on what you find entertaining.  Call me masochistic, but I truly enjoyed the endless 8. I don't think I'd be able to get an experience like that anywhere else, and that made it unique and interesting."
Haruhi,2alocy,FomorianKing,3,Tue Jul 15 07:24:03 2014 UTC,"KyoAni, two things.  1: Thank you for making us feel like Nagato during the whole thing.  2: Good job wasting a bit of money and effort that would've gone towards other story arcs.  Kinda my view. When I'm calm, collected, and/or high."
Haruhi,2alocy,Pentbot,2,Mon Jul 14 00:05:15 2014 UTC,Yes
Haruhi,2alocy,Destroynme,2,Sun Jul 13 20:28:04 2014 UTC,"Probably one of my biggest beefs with endless eight is that they could have done more with it.  If the team know that there is not going to be another season, take some artistic licence with it; show us the E8 events through someone other then Kyon, show us how Yuki is having trouble processing the 10,000th iteration of this week, show us the moment Mikuru realises nothing exists outside this time plane - Hell, show us that Taniguchi is up to."
Haruhi,2alocy,stanthebat,2,Mon Jul 14 01:06:31 2014 UTC,"at first i was actually just gonna skip over the repeats and go for the end, but something told me i should be patient. I ended up observing the different outfits, Camera shots, and the slight changes in conversation and attitude. Not only that, but as many have said it really helps you feel for Nagato (/s ""when the world is set back to the way it was."") In a way I feel a sense of loss to know that Yuki will have so much trouble expressing emotion. But (/s ""the end of the movie and the Haruhi chan series gives the impression that Nagato will slowly gain the ability to express herself."")"
Haruhi,2alocy,stanthebat,4,Mon Jul 14 02:51:58 2014 UTC,"No, you're not."

Haruhi,2alocy,Tapemaster21,1 point,Mon Jul 14 01:34:01 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed watching it, but I also generally watch anime when I'm dead tired and don't want to think too much."
Haruhi,2alocy,Guesty_,1 point,Mon Jul 14 03:20:37 2014 UTC,"I find it okay if you watch it all in one go, but it was absolutely, mind-numbingly terrible to watch it as it aired. As a whole, it seemed like a decent concept that was stretched way to far and consumed too many resources. Two months of suffering wasn't worth it in the least."
Haruhi,2alocy,P-man,1 point,Mon Jul 14 06:03:18 2014 UTC,"I was pretty tired when I watched them the first time, so it didn't have my full attention. Lets just say I didn't notice for long enough that it was REALLY confusing after I did.   I was confused and sort of angry when I realized it was 8 of the basically the same episode, but now after the series, I don't regret watching them. For the characters, it was thousands of times, so I will endure eight for their sake."
Haruhi,2alocy,Kafke,1 point,Mon Jul 14 15:50:09 2014 UTC,Nope! It's my favourite part of the anime!
Haruhi,2alocy,DevoutHaruhiist,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:55:31 2014 UTC,"Potential for spoilers ahead...  Nope. I thought it was awesome aswell... This is a copy-paste of my comment to a similar post in /r/Haruhi a while ago (this post to be precise)   Heh story time. I remember when I first watched endless eight. maybe I'm secretly/unknowingly perceptive, but I was spotting the subtle differences all over the show. I go on record in saying that I enjoyed it first time. no regrets.  I went online in a childish fit of hyperactivity to chat with other Haruhi fans about how awesome it was in a ""yeah I know right!"" way, and to also discuss the stuff about 'insert paragraph about empathising with Yuki'...  I was alone. I thankfully grasped that I had just walked into a hate fest, I slowly backed out of the building realizing I was so badly in the wrong neighborhood I felt a severe form of cyber-hostility was about to hurt my feelings. It was like a closet homosexual was about to come out only to realise last-minute they were in a West-Boro baptist Church meeting.    Many people don't like how it was done but endless 8 was all about putting you in Yuki's shoes. also helping to explain why she did what she did in the movie. I personally thought it was a great way to make you empathise with Yuki, and understand what the hell it must have been like to do that same stuff thousands of times... I remember the first time I saw the first E8 episode; when they meet at the station, the eerie-ness of that scene still gives me a little shiver when I re-watch it. I was literally going through a science-philosophy-come-existential-crisis for a while after that only to get a deja-vu sensation watching the second E8 episode - I've already seen this episode haven't I? then it dawns on you... fuck man, that shit would be terrifying.   Yuki is a boss."
Haruhi,2alocy,stupiddog321,1 point,Tue Jul 15 01:21:34 2014 UTC,"I've watched the whole endless 8 about 3 times now. I'm on my fourth run through.  I found it particularly interesting. The first time though was a great experience. The second time through was hilarious (laughing at my little bro get frustrated). The third time I was mostly bored and just read reddit. This fourth time I'm mostly just bored, but it's fun to notice various things.  Compared to the novel, it's interesting. The anime takes Yuki's perspective, while the novel take's Kyon's perspective. With the novel, you just kind of have to rely on the other's for proof the loop is happening. In the anime, you directly experience it. Which I found neat.  Kind of lets you understand what Yuki's going through."

Haruhi,2a3spm,1tobedoneX,2,Tue Jul 8 04:24:21 2014 UTC,"I remember when I saw this AND the Hare Hare Yukai several years ago, in the Kumikyoku video. I googled ""God Knows"" on YouTube, but I was so confused about episodes and stuff, and what anime it was, that I didn't listen to the full video. Those were the days of ignorance and stupidity, with no understanding of Anime at all."
Haruhi,2a3spm,AesopusDota,1 point,Tue Jul 8 04:55:35 2014 UTC,This song is really good!! Someone knows any similiar songs?
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Wed Jul 9 14:40:09 2014 UTC,"All of FMAB's openings are similar, especially the first one the general 'face stretching' animation happens a lot in the series when there are these powerful emotional scenes.  The singer is called YUI she's REALLY awesome, here's another great work by her: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgO3HrNCzSQ , I guess it's one of bleech's openings(?)  And i'll just put this here : http://youtu.be/4zDt40QiY_4?t=1m19s [if you like the scene this is the soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZia4DxilA ]"
Haruhi,2a3spm,sympathyforthedevill,-4,Thu Jul 10 00:37:15 2014 UTC,"Honestly, that entire episode could really be left out. I felt like the only reason it was there was to provide a nice closure for the story arc.  As for that particular scene, it felt more like a knock-off of the K-On and Angel Beats music scenes, which have more impact than this.  Where Haruhi really shines (IMO) is when it just goes full ""Haruhi"". Philosophy, sci-fi wackiness, and Haruhi's/Kyon's/Koizumi's monologues."
Haruhi,2a3spm,x_entrik,7,Tue Jul 8 04:26:31 2014 UTC,But.... this came before K-On! and Angel Beats?...
Haruhi,2a3spm,Tapemaster21,3,Tue Jul 8 04:31:40 2014 UTC,Yes. And I always felt K-On and Angel Beats had to live up to the standards set by this one scene.
Haruhi,2a3spm,Rein3,4,Tue Jul 8 06:18:38 2014 UTC,"Ew, having just watched Angel Beats last week, I didn't know people liked it anywhere near as much as Haruhi. I thought it was pretty bad imo."
Haruhi,2a3spm,Tapemaster21,1 point,Tue Jul 8 07:13:37 2014 UTC,I never understood the love for Angel Beats... it was mediocre at best. I guess you watched Blue ray rips? I watched half the series when it was earring and the animation was so bad...
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jul 8 14:23:00 2014 UTC,"Weird, that was the only redeeming factor, the art style was the best I've seen. It was probably the rips though."
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jul 8 19:34:21 2014 UTC,"Regardless :P. By ""knock-off"" I mean, done in the same style but not as impactful. In Haruhi, the scene just felt forced, while in Angel Beats it came about naturally, and in K-On it's the entire point (so of course it'd make an impact)."
Haruhi,2a3spm,x_entrik,3,Tue Jul 8 04:35:56 2014 UTC,"maybe forced becaues of the randomness of the episode, 'hey let's make an episode where a random band needs a player and Haruhi will sub for them' BUT IT WAS VERY WELL EXECUTED!, I love this part so much  Not to mention that this episode develops KyonXHaruhi http://youtu.be/oLc_VyQGNaE?t=3m41s"
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jul 8 05:38:54 2014 UTC,True. I just wouldn't say it's that powerful of a scene. Definitely cool though.

Its like the director sat down with the team and asked, how many cool anime elements can we throw into this scene !    high-school setting villain-like character fighting with un-real ""hand sonic"" weapons girls with guns. plenty of gunfire ninja jumping around axe / scythe wielding fighters girl-band epic stage lighting and audience. big-ass fan for extra impact"
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jul 8 06:23:15 2014 UTC,"The thing is, none of it felt out of place. There was quite a bit of story revolving around the band/artists/song, and didn't feel like it was just shoved in compared to the rest of the anime. If anything, the whole anime felt ""forced"", but that's simply due to how much stuff they tried to cram into 12 episodes, which is my main complaint with angel beats. It needed to be 24 episodes instead.  But Haruhi, it's different. Haruhi has/had more than enough time to build up the scene, to make it flow naturally, etc. Instead, it's more of a ""we know we spent a long time building up the movie and focusing on that, but here's a cool music scene as well!""  Hell, even in the novels it's still a side-side-thing.  But I'm getting off track here. My main point was the amount of focus the scenes received relative to the importance of the scene. Haruhi's scene is arguably unimportant. You could cut that entire episode out and the series would be fine. In angel beats, you'd have to cut out quite a bit of things, and it'd affect several characters.  IMO, it has a larger impact in Angel Beats simply due to the ties it has with the characters. In Haruhi, you don't get much. You get some side-character story (which was actually changed for/in the anime), and you get a bit of fan-service of Haruhi/Yuki playing music. It's about as ""powerful"" of a moment as the baseball episode.   Was it cool? definitely. Did I enjoy it? yup. Was it a powerful/impactful/important scene? not in the slightest.  Angel Beats' music scenes (there were 2 or 3 IIRC) were much more important story wise and character wise."
Haruhi,2a3spm,sympathyforthedevill,3,Tue Jul 8 07:07:29 2014 UTC,"Cool.  I appreciate your opinion, and don't get me wrong, I really appreciated Angel Beats, and when that first song kicked off, with the epic lighting, camera-moves, animation and editing - I thought that this was the best anime live music scene of all time.  I still think it is - if anyone has any alternate suggestions, I would love to hear them !  For the sake of discussion, I'd like to explore why I do think the Haruhi scene is epic as well:   early on in the series, it is established that Haruhi is multi-talented, checked out all the music clubs and was sought-after. so it is not so out-of-place after all the accuracy of the animation is one of the best things about this scene. notice how the hand movements (guitar chords, drummer fills etc) are exactly how they would be in real life. it seems they used a technique called rotoscoping to animate some of this scene there is interesting trivia about how there are clues and foreshadowing in the lead up to this scene, for example when Kyon is talking to the male side-characters, you can see a commotion with the other band members in the background and later Haruhi and Nagato running past with guitars.  I noticed this only when I read about it and re-watched the scene.  I like to think that subliminally this adds to the whole awesomeness of this scene :P have to say that the audio editing quality of this episode is top notch. when Kyon is wandering the school, the ambient noise and chatter of a school-festival is perfectly rendered.  Really immerses you in the moment IMO the lead up to the stage performance is drawn-out and boring for maximum impact (Kyon actually falls asleep on his seat).  And overall the whole atmosphere, chaos and randomness of a school-festival is captured brilliantly, which is one reason why I like the whole episode so much obviously, the crowd enjoying the music performance is animated a few levels higher than the typical anime in those days, as I said earlier, I think this scene set a standard that K-On etc had to live up to.  keep in mind this was years before Angel Beats etc. as others have said, the whole experience of helping others and being appreciated is key character development for Haruhi, and at the end, she drags Kyon away by his hand, not his tie or sleeve, which is a definite improvement !   Overall, I'd give an A+ to Kyoto Animation for effort :P  edit: links"
Haruhi,2a3spm,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jul 8 08:16:25 2014 UTC,"Fair enough. I never said the scene wasn't well done. Just that it wasn't a powerful scene for the series (as opposed to the music scenes in angel beats or K-On).   the accuracy of the animation is one of the best things about this scene. notice how the hand movements (guitar chords, drummer fills etc) are exactly how they would be in real life. it seems they used a technique called rotoscoping to animate some of this scene   I like to point this out a lot. K-On does the same thing, and I think angel beats does as well (though I'm not sure about angel beats)."

Kadokawa holds the rights; Kadokawa either approaches an animation studio and asks them to make an anime to promote the LNs, or an animation studio comes to them and they approve the request. KyoAni or a dozen other studios could be aching to make Haruhi S3 right now (though they probably aren't); it all comes down to Kadokawa Publishing not making it happen."

Haruhi,29z1bv,Doughnutcake,3,Sun Jul 6 18:07:39 2014 UTC,"I have been thinking about this too.  There are 7.046 billion people on the earth, this does make you feel a bit overwhelmed, you're raised by your parents feeling special and unique, but are you really that?  ""...One is all, and all is One, remember those ants we saw on the island Alphonse? that got me thinking, if I hadn't eaten them I might've died, then I would've been eaten by them, I'd go into the earth and become grass, then rabbits would eat them. You're talking about the food chain right? yeah but it's not just that either, long time ago this whole island was probably at the bottom of the sea, and tens of thousands of years from now it could be the the peak of the mountain for all we know. All things are connected is that what you're saying? Everything we see! everyone we meet is caught up in a great unseen flow but it's bigger than that it's the entire world, the entire universe even! and compare to something as big as that Al, you an I are tiny not even the size of ants, only one small part within a much greater flow, nothing more than a fraction of a whole. But by putting all those ones together you get one big all just like Teacher said, the flow of this universe follows laws of such big magnitude that you and I cannot even imagine them.""  FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood  Episode 12  It seems very DULL and empty but I think. What makes us, each person out of the 7.billion people, is that we can change other people's lives, we affect our colleagues friends and loved ones, it is what makes our lives significant, the human ability to create these beautiful bonds. Nothing matters if you don't have a person to share it with, an example of this would be at the end of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya Spoiler  The truth, is the life we live in significant at all? are we special? is it all really black and white?

Haruhi,29d3f5,Ergoemos,1 point,Sun Aug 3 19:10:54 2014 UTC,"Perfectly fair, one of of the things I dislike about it as well. I think I got better in Part 2, but I was trying to distinctly capture that trance-like feeling of Endless Eight without making everyone feel like they were sitting through it again by spending time describing each and every scene.   Obviously, mileage varies, but I can absolutely see your point. Its a failing that I am trying to fix."
Haruhi,29dhu0,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sun Jun 29 05:28:42 2014 UTC,"Phew, looks like I woke up just in time.   Oh man, I forgot how great the opening and ending was. Went with the sub since my first watch was the dub. I actually liked it more. I'm glad they didn't stick with the changing hair throughout the series as some of those styles were pretty terrible. I remember my first time seeing this episode now and thinking Haruhi was one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Then as things went on I fell in love with her intense enthusiasm about everything. Still that lack of volume control makes me feel like a Kyon sometimes if you know what I mean."

Haruhi,28u9i7,KeyBlader358,3,Mon Jun 23 02:43:31 2014 UTC,I took the /r/luckystar theme designed by /u/Guesty_ and adapted it to suite strike witches.  If you're interested I can take a crack at Haruhi.
Haruhi,28u9i7,1tobedoneX,2,Mon Jun 23 03:17:05 2014 UTC,"I kinda agree. The little image at the bottom peaking through (climbing in your windows, snatching your people up.

It was later adapted into two light novel series, three manga series, an anime OVA, a televised anime series and various video games. The story revolves around teenage girls who use machines equipped to their legs to do aerial combat. The OVA preview episode was released on January 1, 2007. The televised anime series later aired between on July 3, 2008, and September 18, 2008. A second season aired between July 8, 2010 and September 23, 2010.  A film adaptation was released on March 17, 2012.   A third season and OVA has been announced.

Haruhi,28q5ob,Rika_3141,4,Sat Jun 21 15:29:07 2014 UTC,"I like the new background and the alien is quite suitable, although it could be a good idea to use the SOS symbol (high res png here). The random image looks out of place and honestly the quality of it isn't great.  Is there any way the header can be made larger vertically so we can have something more substantial like /r/luckystar? I'd be willing to make something featuring the main characters if I knew what dimensions it should be (example). Another thing is the subreddit text could be replaced with an image link of the text used for the light novels, akin to this, if necessary a higher resolution version could be found or recreated."
Haruhi,28q5ob,lewwatt,2,Sat Jun 21 16:38:05 2014 UTC,"The random image doesn't even load for me so I'd have no idea how to fix it.   When I first came to this subreddit I had the vision that we'd refrain from changing the whole subreddit; I wanted to keep it simple and clean. But, if you guys want, I can do something with the banner. I can do what I did for /r/groupanime and make it looped with the main characters (forgive how crappy it is on groupanime, I did it really quick).   I can make it nicer here, if anyone's interested"
Haruhi,28q5ob,fatblackninja,2,Sat Jun 21 17:44:38 2014 UTC,The random image doesn't even load for me   I didn't know what to do with it and as lewwatt said it didn't look right in that place so I just chucked it WAY off-screen :P

I also am interested in this banner, but Photoshop and Illustator being such pain in the asses, me having to work over the summerm and therefor having little time, and the fact that I always forget such things makes me so useless."
Haruhi,28q5ob,Taiboss,1 point,Sat Jun 21 18:57:23 2014 UTC,"I thought /r/luckystar looks pretty clean although it isn't simple in the sense that its customisation is so different from the default - it really gives it a nice theme though. I'd definitely be interested in seeing this subs spruced up a bit but like you said, keep it simple and clean.  I just made this as an example, or it can be used if you'd like. I could always add in a few more characters like Tsuruya and Kyon's sister.  Also that random image is gone now."
Haruhi,28q5ob,lewwatt,1 point,Sat Jun 21 19:14:33 2014 UTC,"Wait... what did the subreddit look like before?  Edit: Either way, I like the way it looks right now. Though that little image in the corner of posts overlays the background. Perhaps move it to the left instead? See?"
Haruhi,28q5ob,Kafke,2,Sat Jun 21 15:42:18 2014 UTC,Then it would overlap comments. I'm honestly not sure where I can put it. I'd put it next to the self post box but RES' highlighting overlaps it.
Haruhi,28q5ob,appropriate-username,1 point,Sat Jun 21 16:39:13 2014 UTC,"What are you going for exactly? Having a small image as the background is a bit weird imo, so if you can find a higher resolution pic than I can play around with it."
Haruhi,28q5ob,fatblackninja,1 point,Sat Jun 21 17:40:07 2014 UTC,Remember those little corner images? I initially had them as a sneaky way to demonstrate what comment faces are available and now I'm not sure what to do with 'em.
Haruhi,28q5ob,appropriate-username,2,Sat Jun 21 23:36:27 2014 UTC,Personally I'd just get rid of the corner image.  They not even showing up on Android now (though it kinda doesn't matter because I usually use Reddit sync) but honestly they always screwed up the look.
Haruhi,28q5ob,appropriate-username,2,Sun Jun 22 20:22:56 2014 UTC,What do you think about making them all one size and replacing the reddit self post alien with them?
Haruhi,28q5ob,DogOnInternetz,2,Sun Jun 22 20:27:53 2014 UTC,That sounds like a pretty good idea to me.  I like the suggestions that have been brought up and I think a banner that was similar to luckystar or groupanime would look really nice.
Haruhi,28q5ob,appropriate-username,1 point,Mon Jun 23 02:45:03 2014 UTC,"Annnd good enough, maybe I'll resize the pics later.  As for the banner....I don't like subreddits with huge banners where you have to scroll down all the time to actually see anything and everything that fits in the regular-sized space doesn't really look good."

Haruhi,28m7vz,Muphrid15,1 point,Fri Jun 20 07:43:59 2014 UTC,"I started with VLC, but when I noticed some bad handing with one file, I switched to CCCP on my Desktop and my Labtop. Then one day, my desktop stopped displaying them correctly, so I reinstalled it, then after nothing happened I desinstalled it and installed KCP, which changed nothing, while VLC still works"
Haruhi,28m7vz,Taiboss,1 point,Fri Jun 20 07:51:36 2014 UTC,"Huh, not too sure. I know KCP and CCCP overlap quite a bit, so perhaps some ancient settings are messing with KCP. Or perhaps, your own settings are just mucked.  Either way, a complete removal of all codec packs/mpc-hc (Use something like Revo to uninstall, so that all the config/reg files are grabbed too) and a fresh, standard install of KCP would be the approach I would take. aka, the nuclear approach.   Alternatively, just dedicate MPC-HC to subtitle-handling. You're not exactly getting what you paid for, in using KCP/CCCP as they use a separate sub engine, but could work in a snap patch-job ish way.  (View-> Options> Playback> ""Auto-load subtitles"" is ticked) Make sure that ""Allow animation when buffering"" is ticked under: View> Options> Subtitles."
Haruhi,28m7vz,Muphrid15,1 point,Fri Jun 20 08:03:37 2014 UTC,What is the reason people would hate vlc again?
Haruhi,28m7vz,Kafke,1 point,Fri Jun 20 15:31:47 2014 UTC,"I, myself, am quite surprised too. In my expirience VLC tends to take longer to load and crashes quite often. /a/nons also remark that initially, it was pure shit, displaying, just like Windows, but since 2.0 it slowly developed into something ""acceptable"". The patchnotes even remark:  For Anime Fans  Vastly improved MKV demuxer. Rewritten linked segments and ordered chapter files support. Correct support for FLAC, RV and Hi10p in MKV. Rewritten seeking support in cue files. Various ASS subtitles improvements."
Haruhi,28m7vz,kiririno,1 point,Fri Jun 20 16:34:44 2014 UTC,"I see.  Hm.  Well, I'm on linux half the time anyway, so something like MPC isn't an option.  Having used VLC and many different flavors of MPlayer, I've generally had better results using VLC.  It worked even when the rest of the codecs on my laptop were utterly borked and made every other video player useless."
Haruhi,28m7vz,Guesty_,2,Fri Jun 20 16:42:32 2014 UTC,I love streaming. It lets me know if the series is good before I waste HDD space on it.

Haruhi,28jgig,Taiboss,3,Thu Jun 19 10:29:50 2014 UTC,"well by the looks of the post , I can see this is really an intellectual dissection of a light novel which is under the category for young adults .   It seems the reviewer shows an expectation for a novel of a series that somewhat   revolutionize the Moe boom . The reviewer literally used every logical sense  of this novel with an expectation that it all makes sense but it doesnt .   All I'm trying to say is , Just go ahead and read it as it is . YES , parts of the novel really doesn't make sense even with Koizumi's countless theories of what happened but thats the magic of this novel , parts that left more questions then answers .And these Questions bring up more theories on what happened and that  is left to imagination of the reader itself .   I'm just gonna share a quote from the book "" We humans have been given the power of imagination . Thats the one thing humans can brag about to the natural world . we can compete with godlike beings. Its our only weapon , our single arrow """
Haruhi,28jgig,Muphrid15,2,Thu Jun 19 11:17:39 2014 UTC,"It's not required that stuff make sense, but you know, it does help.  It's incumbent upon the author to handle mysteries carefully.  For the reader to accept something that doesn't all add up on first look, the reader must trust in the author.  The reader must believe that inconsistencies have an underlying, consistent explanation.  Part of the magic of writing is getting readers to accept subtle discrepancies; the resolution of these discrepancies can drive interest in the story.  But Tanigawa doesn't command my trust here.  Given hindsight, the alpha/beta split makes no sense.  Why did we even read the alpha timeline?  What value did we get from that?  It didn't help Kyon resolve the matter of Fujiwara in any way.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothin'.  Tanigawa raised a lot of questions, but seeing how he resolved the questions he did try to answer, I have no faith that the answers to the rest would be satisfying."
Haruhi,28jgig,oshare_banchou,2,Thu Jun 19 18:42:16 2014 UTC,"Maybe the Alpha timeline was a way for the author to give a ""what if "" situation for introducing a new club member , just to give something a more fresher perspective since (from the link I posted) he wanted to make Yasumi feel like "" a new character "" .    i enjoyed the alpha/beta timeline because it was just different then your standard novel reading , it challenged for both the reader and author and it takes some time to get used to but seeing the connections between both the timelines , really challenges your perception of which is reality and which is fake .   I like how you said that as a reader , you trusted the author to give us our money's worth for a good story  .I respect that decision and your reviews are what should be judged when paying for what is told as a good book . My view as an individual , think that if I dissect everything from this book with every bit of reason on why the author did this , it'll just diminish the overall experience of the novel  and thus I accept as what it is for both its strength and flaws ."

Haruhi,288n11,1tobedoneX,2,Mon Jun 16 00:26:11 2014 UTC,It was the image that replaced the regular Google logo during the World Cup.
Haruhi,28941y,1tobedoneX,5,Mon Jun 16 03:43:20 2014 UTC,"Either the world would end, or nothing in particular would happen, or her power would be transferred to Sasaki."
Haruhi,28941y,gameboy17,8,Mon Jun 16 03:52:36 2014 UTC,or her power would be transferred to Sasaki.   So what you are saying is to get off my ass and finish reading the rest of the novels.
Haruhi,28941y,Kafke,2,Mon Jun 16 05:15:22 2014 UTC,"Yes, pretty much, although the exact circumstances probably have to be specific to accomplish that."
Haruhi,28941y,Taiboss,3,Mon Jun 16 06:30:33 2014 UTC,Where DO I find the Light Novels?
Haruhi,28941y,lovestruckluna,1 point,Mon Jun 16 22:24:14 2014 UTC,"I found some in a local library, though that's a very lucky find. Amazon has them as well; support the author/translators!"
Haruhi,28941y,MarshManOriginal,2,Tue Jun 17 01:08:29 2014 UTC,"...I don't have money, I can't get money, and finding Haruhi novels/manga in Canada is as rare as finding Nagato, Asahina, or Koizumi doing non-human things without Haruhi wishing them to do so."
Haruhi,28941y,gameboy17,1 point,Tue Jun 17 04:14:51 2014 UTC,You can order them off amazon or check local bookstores/libraries.
Haruhi,28941y,davesoon,3,Tue Jun 17 03:24:05 2014 UTC,"What will happen to Kyon, Nagato, Koizumi, and Asahina? Will they be replaced? (Haven't read the light novels or manga. If you know how, PM me. not risking spoilers.)"
Haruhi,28941y,gameboy17,3,Mon Jun 16 04:50:59 2014 UTC,"They would probably be fine. If Haruhi were to remake the world, the new one would not have them being supernatural beings, but they remain so in the current one unless she specifically changes it. They would most likely remain as they are in the same way. Sasaki likes them well enough, so I doubt she would get rid of them."
Haruhi,285zgv,Valkren,3,Sat Jun 14 23:48:34 2014 UTC,I think this is relevant.

Haruhi,283qkq,lalogutz79,4,Sat Jun 14 02:29:47 2014 UTC,"I think chronological order would make more sense because you see the evolution of the characters a little more plainly.  Also, I watched it in broadcast order the first time, and I was really confused sometimes because Kyon was in school and then suddenly it would be the middle of summer because it would flip back and forth between time periods.  In the end though you can't go wrong with either way you choose.  TMOHS is a winner all around."
Haruhi,283qkq,DogOnInternetz,1 point,Sat Jun 14 03:23:36 2014 UTC,Ah yes I think I'm goin to watch it chronologically with him. Nice pic!
Haruhi,283qkq,Gzalzi,2,Sat Jun 14 07:29:08 2014 UTC,Chronological order. The show is pointlessly confusing otherwise - it's not like the books were done in that order.
Haruhi,283qkq,Schmigle,1 point,Sat Jun 14 04:31:40 2014 UTC,Yeah I think you are right. I want him to watch it as I did figuring out things as they go. But that would complicate the show and possibly make people enjoy it less aha
Haruhi,283qkq,Doughnutcake,2,Sat Jun 14 07:30:29 2014 UTC,"For my first watch through (which I recently completed) I initially watched the first season in broadcast (non-chronological order) then watched the first and second seasons together chronologically before watching the movie. Watching the first season twice is a bit more of a commitment, but I appreciated following the show the way it was broadcasted for both season one and one and two together."
Haruhi,283qkq,SirPrize,2,Sat Jun 14 03:08:59 2014 UTC,I watched season 1 then season 2. I enjoyed how season 2 filled in much of that gaps and what happened in between episodes of season 1
Haruhi,283qkq,Taiboss,2,Sat Jun 14 07:28:14 2014 UTC,"Hey OP! I fully support this answer.  I've said this multiple times on this subreddit and I will always make a case for this.  Season 1 broadcast order may not be the way the light novel story was meant to be presented, but it is still an absolute brilliant telling by itself.    I wont give my spiel on why broadcast order is so great unless OP really wants to hear it though."
Haruhi,283qkq,zaturama007,2,Mon Jun 16 06:16:28 2014 UTC,"Just make sure you watch the movie last! To me, that was the perfect way to wrap up the series, because it so so much more powerful after you've gotten to get attached to the characters (specifically the mindset of Kyon).  My question for you OP is, are you brave enough for the endless eight?"
Haruhi,283qkq,davesoon,1 point,Sat Jun 14 13:01:29 2014 UTC,"Semi-Book order. First Melancholy, then Sigh, then Boredom, Baboom, Sign, Island Syndrome, Endless Eight, Day of Sag, Adventures of Asahina, Live Alive and finally One day in the Rain as it is an original, and then Dissapperance."
Haruhi,27zbrb,Compupaq,1 point,Thu Jun 12 17:41:43 2014 UTC,"Was the one on the right Yuuko, from Nichijou?"

The Series Dub isn't bad per se, it's more like you're having a different, more formal, Kyon as Narrator. And, I too, want to punch the one who is responsible for making Kim Hasper Koizumi, not Kyon."
Haruhi,27r3je,OST9,3,Tue Jun 10 02:18:48 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind, the anime transcript is extremely similar to the light novels. That being said, I still think it's worth it to read all the novels. :P"
Haruhi,27r3je,Doughnutcake,2,Tue Jun 10 03:31:58 2014 UTC,"I only skipped the first because it's the main arc of the anime. But I read it later, and I loved Kyon's sarcasm.  Read them in publish order. And please, please, do NOT skip novel four!"
Haruhi,27r3je,otakuman,1 point,Tue Jun 10 02:26:14 2014 UTC,I've heard that the second and third volumes are of mediocre quality. Should I skip them or are they still enjoyable to read?
Haruhi,27r3je,Taiboss,1 point,Tue Jun 10 02:51:50 2014 UTC,"1,2,3,4 as well as chapters from 5 and 6 are adapted into anime, so yeah. Season 1 is book 1, all but one from 3, as well as one chapter from 5 and two from 6. Season 2 is the remaining from 3, one from 5 and 2. The film is 4. The adaptions are very faithful, so if you disliked any arc, you will not like it in book form."

Regardless, good choice, though most of the pictures you'll see have her with an acoustic (because I just looked haha), or this sort of sunburst strat.   Judging from the plethora of Yui pics I've seen she uses the red strat with black pick guard.   I dunno, your comment got me curious, and now I want to rewatch Angel Beats. Spoiler Title"
Haruhi,27i8zn,1tobedoneX,1 point,Sat Jun 7 18:07:41 2014 UTC,"I don't remember, but I believe she had a White pick Guard. I'm not so sure. Oh yeah. It's either having Red with White Guard, Red with Black Guard, or Sunburst. Unfortunately, I just have a black Starcaster. (I rechecked.) But hey, Starcasters look like Stratocasters."

I forgot, but when all the employees saw me walk up with that price tag they were like ""holy shit man you know whats up!""  So instead I walked out of there with my Dime instead of a warrior.

Haruhi,277jon,Kafke,7,Tue Jun 3 21:54:58 2014 UTC,I'm a big fan of this image. Because it so perfectly sums up the anime.  This one perhaps because it captures Haruhi's attitude towards things.  This part from the OP is also pretty good.  Maybe this one.  But perhaps the thing that best summarizes the show is the S2 opening. IIRC this is what actually sold me on it before I started watching.

Haruhi,2745bq,Valkren,4,Mon Jun 2 21:15:17 2014 UTC,"Basically, but that really was never the case in the first place - biggest one being that the author stopped writing and thus nothing further to promote. Also KyoAni has better things to work on like their own IP and such."
Haruhi,2745bq,djrubbie,4,Mon Jun 2 22:39:26 2014 UTC,Is this what I think it means? I can't help but feel doubt.
Haruhi,2745bq,vortex_thrace,9,Mon Jun 2 15:14:15 2014 UTC,"According to 4chan, it says that she voiced the narration of the Haruhi Hunting Game. But, more importantly, it means that she is still Haruhi, one thing many people feared would change."
Haruhi,2745bq,Anonymous7056,3,Mon Jun 2 15:28:07 2014 UTC,"She basically says she did the voice recordings for a Haruhi pachinko machine, it was a pretty big project and lots of fun, look forward to it, blah blah blah. She also mentions doing a recording for a game, so keep an eye out for news about that. It sounds like she's referring to another game besides the pachinko machine, but I could be wrong.  Basically, nothing for us to get excited about."
Haruhi,2745bq,Ichigatsu,2,Mon Jun 2 17:20:09 2014 UTC,"I'm hopeful.  This course of events will not likely mean ""season 3"" - but it shows Haruhi is still definitely on the potential projects list (i.e. not completely written off) I reckon within the next two/three years there will be some kind of announcement or leak about animating the rest of the books (bold claim I know, but I just think it'd be stupid for them not to do it).  also; since one of the 'reasons' for there never being a season 3 was due to Hirano not being able to voice Haruhi (apparently). It means we can at least cross that 'reason' off the list for now."

Haruhi,2745bq,TheRandomMan1000,1 point,Tue Jun 3 14:12:20 2014 UTC,"Regardless of the fact that we'll probably just get another Pachinko machine of this, you need to admit that this is good for those of us that want another season.   The franchise is obviously still active if an event like this is happening. KyoAni did the video for Haruhi hunting, which they could have done for pocket change, but still, they're willing to help in a Haruhi related project. One of the main reasons we didn't expect a season 3 was Aya Hirano no longer doing Haruhi's voice, again like KyoAni, she could just be looking for pocket change, but hell, she wouldn't pick up the role if she was entirely uninterested.  I think a 3rd season just revolves around Kyoto seeing money in the prospect of more Haruhi, because there are no new books being released to promote. We'll just have to wait, but I'm hopeful."
Haruhi,2745bq,errantsignal,1 point,Tue Jun 3 21:34:32 2014 UTC,"I'm chiming in a little late here, but here's a translation for my dear Haruhiists. Someone said there was a translation on 4-chan too, but I couldn't find it.   I recorded the narration to the ""Haruhi Hunting"" promotional video announced yesterday.  When I wrote that I was revisiting an old role on my blog last year, it was the Haruhi pachinko game ♪  It was a pretty big project and I had a lot of fun. It's a wonderful plan that everyone across the country can participate in!  Please wait for my follow-up report, okay? ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ  After that is recording a game ♪  A performance from a popular series has been decided!  An interesting role... ☆  Please wait for a follow-up report on that too!   So, indeed, she does also refer to a game besides the pachinko machine, but it doesn't sound like a Haruhi game she's referring to (although she doesn't actually rule it out). She likes to be awfully vague...  EDIT: Added her emoji."

It's not Elfen Lied. It's gets better, especially in Kai.   Also, because of Kyon Big Damn Hero, every Haruhi fan has to be a Higurashi fan."

Haruhi,272mhc,Kafke,2,Fri Jun 6 13:07:31 2014 UTC,"You can skip Tatarigoroshi-hen and Meakashi-hen. I will explain a bit.  The first three arcs (Onikakushi-hen, Watanagashi-hen, Tatrigoroshi-hen) are typical gore arcs. The last question arc, Himatsubushi-hen (starting episode 14) lays out the exact mystery, which in my opinion is what makes Higurashi good. The next arc, Meakashi-hen (16-20), is also very gory, as it tells you what really happened during Watanagashi-hen, as well as answers background regarding Mion, Shion, as well as Satoko and Satoshi. The second answer arc, Tsumihoroboshi-hen (21-26), answers many things related to Onikakushi-hen, and is the point where Higurashi goes away from random killings to the characters actually wanting to solve the mystery and save each other."

Haruhi,27141a,Ferrarity,5,Sun Jun 1 14:20:39 2014 UTC,"Problem #1: /r/anime. It's just...that place. I can't remember the last time I actively checked that place for content. It's been at least a year if not longer. The people there are just...no. I'm not surprised you got downvoted for having an opinion that differed from others there.  E8 was disappointing to say the least. I enjoyed everything but E8, and it honestly made me put the anime on hold for about a month. Would've been longer but someone forced me to finish it and I'm glad they did (I watched E8 eps 1-6, skipped 7 haha).   In my opinion, I'm not really sure what could happen with an s3. Do I want them to take the chance where, they could make it a huge success OR a huge failure? I'm not sure. I'm happy that they ended on a light note (I guess that differs per viewer, but that's just me). I wouldn't be terribly butthurt if they didn't make an s3, but what if they did? Why not I'll watch it."

There really is a hivemind there alright, but the opinions of the hivemind seem erratic and can sometimes be very different to that of other Anime communities   (I watched E8 eps 1-6, skipped 7 haha).   I watched #1, #2, #3, and then went ""Fuck this!"" and just skipped to #8.   I wouldn't be terribly butthurt if they didn't make an s3, but what if they did? Why not I'll watch it.

It wasn't more than a single short story in the novels, and that's good enough for me.  Does that arc make the second season disappointing?  I think that's a valid opinion, but I think there are a lot of people who convinced themselves that 8 episodes of almost the same thing every time was somehow good.  I recognize that it was an opportunity to do something really artsy (to show off how subtle differences could be peppered in, to make a statement on repetition, etc.), but...eh, doesn't sound entertaining to me.  I'm not sure what you're talking about regarding filler besides that.

Haruhi,27141a,leopold_s,3,Mon Jun 2 03:30:32 2014 UTC,"Having read both the novel and watched the E8, it's interesting. The anime takes the perspective of Yuki, while the novel takes the perspective of Kyon. I think the E8 episodes really help build up the point that's made in Disappearance, which is really the only reason to watch them.  I personally also liked playing the ""what's different"" game. There's lots of little detail differences, and it's interesting to spot them.  It's a unique experience, and one that I've been through three times now (my first watch, then with my brother, and again with my roommate).  Is it necessary? No way in hell. Copying the novel and just doing the last episode would've worked fine. Is it a cool/unique/interesting experience you can't really get anywhere else? Yes.  It really gets you to sympathize with Yuki, and that (IMO) is really nailed down with the repeated eight episodes (even though they are still quite different).  Honestly, you just need to watch until the point is made. For me, that was about 3-4 episodes. For my little brother, that was like 2-3, and for my roommate it took 5 or 6.  My biggest complaint is that it took up ""slots"" for S2, so we didn't get as much new stuff."
Haruhi,27141a,Taiboss,2,Tue Jun 3 00:10:36 2014 UTC,"Here's what I liked about it: Nagato is supposed to be the artificial being.  But in Endless Eight, the human characters are revealed to be behaving like automatons, like simple input-output machines, almost always responding the same way to the same stimuli.  And Nagato, who has always seemed like she had virtually no emotional state, becomes the emotional center of the whole thing.  You feel, or I felt, her horror at the possibility that this will go on forever, and that her only companions will be people whose understanding of what's happening is so limited that they're like dementia patients.  She's an artificial being with no ability to emote, but the story communicates, in an extremely subtle way, that she's in despair.  That was the keystone of the whole thing for me.  And beyond that, it seems to me that the storyline is a challenge to actual human beings to MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.  For fuck's sake, don't just coast along on automatic; DO some goddamn thing.  Anything.  Perturb the situation a little bit.  Do your part to keep Nagato from going nuts.  Now, was it too long at eight episodes?  This is where everybody's gonna have their own answer.  I thought it was occasionally tedious, but tedium is part of the story.  Is there a difference between making the audience feel the fictional tedium that's part of the story, and making the audience feel the actual tedium that you've introduced into their lives by wasting their time with this foolishness?  (Heh.)  Again, your mileage may vary, but I was on board the whole time.  The whole arc is, what, a little more than three hours, total?  That's the amount of time some people spend watching a football game every Sunday, once a week for decades.  And I'll tell you what: Endless Eight has nothing on professional sports when it comes to actions that are repeated thousands of times with only minor variations..."
Haruhi,27141a,Doughnutcake,4,Mon Jun 2 04:41:49 2014 UTC,"Seeing Nagato's slide into despair is a strong point of the animated adaptation.  I definitely feel that's a plus of adaptation:  KyoAni clearly wanted to make ""Endless Eight"" into a prologue, of sorts, for Disappearance.  And that's an improvement compared to the short story.  ""Endless Eight"" as a short story relies upon the weirdness of the premise and the oddness of the situation to drive the reader's interest.  It's not really about Nagato's suffering, even though the story is set perfectly to be the start of Nagato's spiral into Disappearance.  Perhaps this is some affinity for extreme subtlety on Tanigawa's part, but I think he dropped the ball.  ""Endless Eight"" the short story is too short and doesn't milk the situation for character development and growth as much as it could, or as it should.  So, was KyoAni trying to compensate for that?  Perhaps.  And if so, I could certainly admire them for trying.  It's definitely a case in which I would agree in principle with adaptation expansion.  But as you pointed out, it's almost three hours.  At 23 minutes an episode, but minus opening and ending themes, the running time is comparable with the length of the Disappearance movie.  And Disappearance was a long movie.  I don't think it wise to spend that much time making two points about Nagato's despair and the uselessness of human beings to change the situation."

Haruhi,26yt60,Taiboss,5,Sat May 31 16:52:32 2014 UTC,From this thread. Things are going rather fast.

Haruhi,26yt60,Rika_3141,1 point,Sat May 31 22:26:39 2014 UTC,"Hey Taiboss, it's kinda funny how I just started playing katawa shoujo a few days ago and I just cleared the shizune/misha route (good end) today, thanks for this awesome coincidence :)"
Haruhi,26zyht,DogOnInternetz,3,Sun Jun 1 01:22:40 2014 UTC,"Nagato just hacks in cuz she can, and why not.  Asahina simply uses the ""classified information"" to ""classified information"". Duh Koizumi is an esper, and it's clear he has plenty to hide.  Haruhi is God. Kyon is her puppet."
Haruhi,26zyht,Bakenal,3,Sun Jun 1 02:32:10 2014 UTC,I just figured that it's never specified whether it's a thought or whether he is speaking. I like the ambiguity.
Haruhi,26zyht,Kafke,1 point,Sun Jun 1 06:18:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, in the books you only know for sure Kyon is speaking when the author uses """", for other situations you have to figure it out by context.   In the show they translate it to showing or hiding Kyon's mouth when he monologues/speaks. If you hear Kyon talking but can't see his mouth, you won't know if he's thinking it in the moment, monologueing it afterwards or actually speaking it. I like how the show kinda throws you off with what you think is a monologue, only for it to make it a dialogue.  The example by the OP is an interesting one because you can see that kyon's mouth isn't moving during the thought, though you could argue that you can only see his mouth inside the fantasy, not his real one."
Haruhi,26zyht,Valkren,2,Sun Jun 1 20:04:07 2014 UTC,"After the first TV episode (and then reading the books), I just sort of assumed Kyon was the real God, living his fantasies out through an outgoing personality in Haruhi.  His name isn't his name, he's surrounded by a varied group of stereotypical personalities inside attractive girls who all are enamored by him in one way or another, the only other guy seems non-sexual and therefore non threatening to him figuring out himself.  His very first sentence of his monlogue in the first episode is extremely telling.  And the books have some massively obvious clues after you get past the books that got turned into the two television seasons.  Assuming you're still reading the books don't spoil it here.    Evidence  Stepping back and looking at their crew, everyone has a reason to be there but him.  They all have intrinsic worth, whereas Kyon is the deadweight that just happens to do/say the right thing to make it all work out.  He is the deus ex machina, who says the right thing at the right moment to make things...right.  Haruhi's reason of including him was that he said something at the right moment to be included could easily be a copout for and otherwise unambitious but wanting God to be included without the pressure of leading.  Anytime something bad happens and Koizumi points to Haruhi being the reason (creating whatever subconsciously) when it could have just as easily been Kyon being the reason.  Kyon is normally the one really frustrated.  Everything happens in the storylines with Kyon at the center, and, if you don't automatically assume it's that way because the reader needs someone to attach to, then it makes sense that it's more likely Kyon is God than Haruhi is.  The whole series is a great exercise in meta-thinking and reading contextual clues.  Assuming the spoiler thing didn't work right, i'll edit.  TL:DR,    Kyon is God, everyone hears him because of it, and he lives vicariously through Haruhi's leading."
Haruhi,26zyht,Anathemae,1 point,Sun Jun 1 07:15:41 2014 UTC,"This sounds similar to a situation in the book Hyperion by Dan Simmons. There is a poet whose apocalyptic fiction is linked to the behavior of an otherworldly murderous demigod called ""the Shrike"" that can seemingly bend the laws of physics. The only limit to this deimgod seems to be the poet's rate of writing. The poet considers the Shrike to be ""his muse"". When he hears tales of the Shrike's murders, he feels compelled to write. When he writes, the Shrike commits more atrocities. The poet is fearful that he is responsible for the Shrike's crimes and tries to figure out how to prevent the crimes from ever happening in the first place (the Shrike may live in a bubble of reversed time... whatever that means).  The Shrike could be argued to be the center of events in Hyperion yet its actions and power is limited by specific actions of observers (like the poet) who do not otherwise show any outstanding qualities.  In a similar vein, in the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett, deities are numerous but their supernatural power and influence are limited by the number of conscious minds that believe in them. Gods wither away and die without belief. If Discworld god/belief mechanics were to be followed, Haruhi's power would require a very large number of minds to believe in her. Maybe Kyon is a conduit of belief that fuels Haruhi's powers. After all, I believe the Haruhi series was originally aimed at young men trying to project themselves onto a fantasy-fulfilling story where they get the unconditional love from a smart/beautiful/powerful high school girl.  None of this has any relevance to our reality, of course. This is just my attempt at puzzling out where Tanigawa Nagaru is going with the Haruhi story."
Haruhi,26zyht,baltakatei,1 point,Thu Jun 5 00:15:27 2014 UTC,"I noticed this too, but I only noticed Haruhi doing it, so I assumed she was just using her latent God powers to listen in on his thoughts."
Haruhi,26zyht,Shadowwolflink,1 point,Sun Jun 1 20:01:34 2014 UTC,"It happens with other members of the SOS Brigade, not just Haruhi. I thought a lot about this early on, and noticed that the first time it happens in the anime is when Kyon sees her haircut and thinks ""Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?"" or something like that, to which she responds, ""Not really.""  After reading the novels, I'm convinced it's just Tanigawa's way of showing that Kyon tends to ""think out loud."" Some of the ""thoughts"" that people respond to can have some pretty sensitive information in them, so there's no way the entire phrase was spoken out loud with Haruhi around, meaning he has to transition from thought to speech at some point in the middle. It's just Tanigawa's style, and I honestly really like it."
Haruhi,26ytlc,Swaps4,5,Sat May 31 16:58:02 2014 UTC,"The worst part is, on the related 4chan thread, one user asked which aya song that was, and another aswered ""Isn't it God Knows""?  I had no words."

All can be found on Amazon."
Haruhi,26zt7h,appropriate-username,2,Sun Jun 1 00:10:36 2014 UTC,"I agree with your point, but I think we also have to look at this from the other perspective.  When has Haruhi ever been known to show self-constraint?  In that case, I think that we would suddenly find espers had their powers all the time, or the shinjin might be roaming all the time because she would expect the espers to come say the day.  I am not sure if Haruhi would just constrain the espers to what they were originally intended to do because ""if a little is good, then a lot must be great!"""
Haruhi,26zt7h,DogOnInternetz,2,Sun Jun 1 00:52:34 2014 UTC,the shinjin might be roaming all the time   Surely even Haruhi wouldn't want to actually hurt real people?
Haruhi,26zt7h,DogOnInternetz,2,Sun Jun 1 01:25:17 2014 UTC,"That's true, but she didn't seem to think that they would hurt her and Kyon when they were trapped in closed space either. Maybe because she thinks they are nice, things could get out of control because Haruhi wouldn't restrain them from destroying things."

I'm guessing it's a new Aya Hirano Haruhi concert tour.   ...and Sankyo... Sankyo have already announced that a Haruhi pachinko is releasing in July.   Could be hype for the new Sankyo pachinko.   After all these ""Haruhi announcements"" (remember Haruhi's wish?), I'm not giving my hopes for a Season 3. Maybe something mundane that'll bring a little cash to the table. After all, the way the producers didn't fulfill the fan's demands for another season, and since the show had an unclear conclusion, Haruhi may very well be irrelevant in Japanese anime culture now (it definitely has fallen here in the US, as is proven by any anime company's lack of desire to save the Haruhi license from the now-defunct Bandai DVD distribution division)."

Haruhi,267zms,Kafke,5,Thu May 22 17:03:04 2014 UTC,"Mikuru = Better  Haruhi = same-ish but a softer face (?)  Yuki = taken straight from disappearance.  Colors are more washed out too.  Is this actually the before/after? Or is it a joke? I can't tell :\. Either way, both look fine to me."
Haruhi,267zms,Doughnutcake,3,Thu May 22 18:19:03 2014 UTC,I think it's a shop where someone took the original and applied the KyoAni sameface.
Haruhi,267zms,FalkAlmstadt,3,Thu May 22 19:01:11 2014 UTC,"Omg I'm so glad you posted this I keep telling people how much the style change bothered me, but nobody ever listens or knows what I'm talking about and then I have to go find specific screens to show them."
Haruhi,267zms,winesti,2,Fri May 23 02:57:17 2014 UTC,"Damn, Haruhi decided to work out a little... I like how Yuki suddenly gets a facial expression."
Haruhi,267zms,winesti,2,Thu May 22 16:59:20 2014 UTC,I don't get it.
Haruhi,267zms,winesti,3,Thu May 22 20:10:47 2014 UTC,"What is there to get? The above is a well known promo pic of the first season, the second is it redone with the KyoAni sameface style they had adopted by the time season 2 was made."
Haruhi,267zms,Doughnutcake,2,Thu May 22 20:13:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know what KyoAni sameface is. Was all of Season 2 like this?  Regardless, I like the first one better and the second makes me sad."
Haruhi,267zms,CaptainTipper,3,Thu May 22 20:45:17 2014 UTC,A little comparison
Haruhi,267zms,Rika_3141,3,Thu May 22 20:46:55 2014 UTC,"I didn't really notice anything different in season two, but seeing them side by side makes me wonder why they changed it."
Haruhi,267zms,1tobedoneX,3,Thu May 22 22:53:39 2014 UTC,I personally think it was because of how successful K-On!! was and so the animators just kinda stuck to it.
Haruhi,267zms,zaturama007,3,Fri May 23 02:58:24 2014 UTC,You have to remember the sharp edges and sharp lighting they had originally was taken from Full Metal Panic which was KyoAni's first work. but they only animated Fumoffu and The Second Raid. The first FMP series was animated by Gonzo and KyoAni slowly developed and deviated from Gonzo's style into what they have currently. Compare Air and Clannad After Story which was a gap of 3 years and it had changed but only slightly. It was K-On that they changed their style the most dramatically and they have slowly developed that now.   tl;dr KyoAni developed from gonzo's style in FMP

I have a nice feeling in my spine. I'm intrigued by why the chose 707 to be the number of images.  I compiled some information:   July 18 – Emperor Monmu dies after a 10-year reign. He is succeeded by his aunt Genmei who becomes the 43rd empress of Japan. She is the sister of former empress Jitō and, the niece and wife of late emperor Tenmu.   that looks interesting    707 = 7 × 101, sum of five consecutive primes (131 + 137 + 139 + 149 + 151)   707 is a three digit number which could hint at S3 (My heart hopes...)  also roman numerals are DCCVII   Japanese calendar  Keiun 4 (慶雲４年)   707 in the Japanese calender  the square root of 707 is 26.589471600616662122755755097938...

Haruhi,267rh3,Kafke,1 point,Thu May 22 16:38:22 2014 UTC,What's this about a TWEWY countdown?
Haruhi,267rh3,MarshManOriginal,6,Thu May 22 18:12:55 2014 UTC,"A while back (I forget how long ago) there was a ""mysterious"" countdown posted on the TWEWY site. It was a week long (7 days), and everyone was hyped as shit. Naturally the implication was a huge countdown for something cool (TWEWY2, obvs). Each day, the music on the page was remixed and added in another song.  Here is the finished (day 0) song.  Anyway, at the end of the countdown, what was revealed wasn't TWEWY2. It was just a port of the game to iOS with removed gameplay and HD graphics and some song remixes. Nothing exciting.  It was a huuuuuge let down, especially after everyone was hyping it up to be TWEWY2 or something like that.  After a few weeks or so, someone finally 100%ed it, and there was a teaser for the actual TWEWY 2, but it was just a teaser image and nothing more. Which made the whole thing a bit better."

I distinctly remember watching it in school (it was the time of the year where nothing happens anymore), and my friend asked me what I was watching, and I, on episode 3 said, ""I don't know, I am still trying to understand it.""  I watched chronological. If I had watched broadcast, I would have dropped it."

So fast track to a couple of months later and i Found a file of about 4 and a half thousand anime wallpapers, all the picture were in folders for their specific anime, so i went through them all and found one called Haruhi entered it and there it was! So much Relief at that point!!"

In Fahrenheit, it's 70.7 degrees.) and in January, you got -5 Degrees. That may sound like weather in Nunavut, but it's not considering Celsius. (22.1 Fahrenheit.) Our record high is a 38.3 in August (100.94 Fahrenheit), and the record low is a -31.3 Degrees. (-24.34 Fahrenheit). Basically, Southern Ontario is like the Northern US.

Haruhi,261ykx,FomorianKing,13,Tue May 20 19:11:13 2014 UTC,I just figured the situation was a bit embarrassing for her:   Kyon is sleeping. Haruhi notices and puts her coat on him. Haruhi has to wait around for Kyon to wake up to get her coat back and lock up. Kyon wakes up and figures out the situation. Embarrassment occurs.   Makes sense to me. But maybe that's just because I'm an awkward person...
Haruhi,261ykx,Kafke,2,Tue May 20 20:50:39 2014 UTC,God I love this show. Such a simple a way to create both mini-conflict and sweetness; and the show does this all the time.
Haruhi,261ykx,chillbro88,5,Wed May 21 13:22:31 2014 UTC,I thought it was because she had put her coat on him.

Haruhi,261ykx,x_entrik,3,Wed May 21 00:27:19 2014 UTC,"I think the simple answer is that she had just put her coat on him, which woke him up."
Haruhi,261ykx,AusBox,2,Wed May 21 02:09:48 2014 UTC,Well she put away two cameras after Kyon woke up...   I always thought she was doing something similar to Kyon at the end of disappearance.
Haruhi,261ykx,Xirema,2,Wed May 21 01:27:50 2014 UTC,"First of all, there's no one definitive ""this is definitely what happened"" answer: it's all speculation.  Having said that, I'm pretty sure she was drawing on his face with her finger, the same way Kyon did to her at the end of Disappearance."
Haruhi,261ykx,Smilelele,1 point,Wed May 21 01:40:55 2014 UTC,"It was, but it dragged on for about twice as long as an awkward pause needed to. Sort of like how Infinite Eight was five goddamn episodes too long."

Haruhi,261ykx,Taiboss,1 point,Tue May 20 21:55:08 2014 UTC,"I figured it was because she'd been watching him sleep. The scripts just says ""Kyon wakes up. We see the shadow of someone being interrupted as Kyon opens his eyes."""
Haruhi,261ykx,Taiboss,1 point,Tue May 20 22:02:13 2014 UTC,"It is not obvious, there never was an explanation given.  My theory was that she tried to kiss him, then he woke up. And Haruhi reacts to such a thing."
Haruhi,261ykx,1tobedoneX,1 point,Tue May 20 21:42:44 2014 UTC,"Is there any evidence to suggest that she would do such a thing? Because that seems like something (elder) Mikuru would pull off, not Haruhi."
Haruhi,261ykx,davesoon,2,Tue May 20 19:29:33 2014 UTC,"There is no evidence, it is purely speculation. Haruhi is a gold mine for speculation, so such a theory has its ground.  And really, realitically speaking, is any other pairing than Haruhi/Kyon gonna happen? Probably not."
Haruhi,261ykx,kiririno,6,Tue May 20 19:41:52 2014 UTC,Yuki/Laptop. You cannot convince me otherwise.

Haruhi,25va96,Rika_3141,3,Sun May 18 16:56:32 2014 UTC,To use a slightly old gag: I'm in despair! The feels inflicted by this post have left me in despair!
Haruhi,25va96,Serxeid,4,Sun May 18 18:39:40 2014 UTC,"Zetsubu Sensei never gets old. On that note, I read it has Haruhi references, but I haven't seen the series yet. Are there many, and in which episodes roughly are they?"
Haruhi,25va96,Serxeid,3,Sun May 18 19:40:25 2014 UTC,"I vaguely remember something along those lines, but I haven't looked at any of the Zetsubou Sensei media in years, sorry."

Haruhi,25va96,1tobedoneX,3,Mon May 19 01:49:06 2014 UTC,Reminds me of this 4chan post about Yui and Angel Beats.

Haruhi,25va96,Kafke,1 point,Thu May 22 09:57:46 2014 UTC,lol no. Same genre of music though. Which is Denpa. Go check out /r/denpa if you are curious. As I said: super-happy genki music.

Haruhi,25va96,thephotoman,2,Thu May 22 10:51:56 2014 UTC,NOOOOOOOOOOO!  Why can't I have IRL Nagato?
Haruhi,25va96,1tobedoneX,4,Mon May 19 15:16:03 2014 UTC,"Because currently, we have no IRL Haruhi."
Haruhi,25va96,Kafke,3,Mon May 19 16:52:10 2014 UTC,"What if we live in the world of the 18th December? AHH, I feel ripped off."
Haruhi,25va96,1tobedoneX,3,Mon May 19 18:11:39 2014 UTC,There's lots of Nagatos. You just will never find any. I used to be a Nagato. Slowly growing out of it.
Haruhi,25va96,Kafke,2,Tue May 20 04:00:46 2014 UTC,...now if you excuse me. I'll be borrowing this shotgun. It's for reasons.
Haruhi,25va96,thephotoman,5,Tue May 20 10:07:13 2014 UTC,"Being an experienced Nagato, there's a few tips/tricks to finding them. The first is to look for younger people. Most Nagatos are middle schoolers. Elementary kids are usually too young to be shy (though it starts as early as 2nd/3rd grade), and high school+ they tend to start growing out of it. Latest is probably around college-ish, but by then they tend to be more outgoing due to social constraints.  Libraries are big with Nagatos (obviously), but you might also want to check private study rooms (that you don't have to register for), their apartments, tagging along with a more outgoing (and talkative) friend, and the people who eat alone. Nagatos tend to do that.  As I said, they exist. It's just they are hard to find. Think of it this way: if Haruhi never decided to start the club, Kyon wouldn't have met/found Nagato. Neither would have Mikuru, Haruhi, Koizumi, Tsuruya, etc. Up until then, she'd just been sitting in the 1 person literary club.  That's where you find Nagatos. When I was younger, I spent a lot of time in my classrooms (during recess and break) and in the library, simply reading. Now that I'm older I don't go out much and opt to stay inside. Though I've been trying to get out more.  Just know where to look, and try talking to people who look like they are by themselves. They won't go up and talk to you, and you won't find them by simply doing things. It's a tricky situation."
Haruhi,25va96,Kafke,2,Tue May 20 12:04:09 2014 UTC,"But see, I'm not a pedophile."
Haruhi,25va96,thephotoman,2,Tue May 20 14:47:22 2014 UTC,"That's why I said it'd be hard/impossible. Most Nagatos grow up and learn to be more outgoing. Generally that happens around high school and college.  You might be able to find some that are older, but I can't imagine there being that many."
