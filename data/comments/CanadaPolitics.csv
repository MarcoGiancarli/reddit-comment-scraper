It does in the sense of long term systemic change but in terms of day to day governing, why would someone care?  The means justify the ends.  My personal favourite example of this is Singapore.  On paper, Singapore's a democracy, we enjoy good relations with them, the country has a great standard of living, and for the most part, they aren't really critiszed around the world.  There's no grand objections to the country, the people, largely, don't complain.  Opposition parties in Singapore are stifled, sued, are essentially banned from critisizing the party in power; major companies have leaders who are very closely related to the party in power and the prime minister - in practice, it's a dictatorship.  In general, very few people give a shit about 'process' until something goes wrong.   For me personally, their approach towards Democracy, treatment of the media, of scientists, of due process in governing, and partisanship are not only the main reason I will not be voting for this Government but are what will almost entirely be determining who I vote for in the next election.  I've ranted about this before, but I have very little confidence in our system improving; it's only going to get worse."

I echo this sentiment. For example, I find many of the newly proposed Liberal policies quite attractive, and all else being equal they would likely guarantee my support, but I'm not convinced that the current Liberal leadership has the necessary respect for democratic fundamentals, as evidenced by their support for legislation that infringes on our civil liberties, particularly our ability to meaningfully dissent. For that reason alone, I am currently much more likely to vote NDP."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,insanity_irt_reality,4,Tue Jul 21 17:40:14 2015 UTC,"The thing I don't like about the NDP is their stance on abolishing the Senate.    I seriously wish Senate representatives were simply appointed by the provinces instead of the PM.    Let the provinces have some say in the Senate composition and perhaps it would at least be representative of provincial wishes.  Abolishing sober second thought is a very bad thing.   Currently the Senate can keep things in check for a number of years.  Say the NDP gain power next election, a Conservative majority in the Senate would prevent the NDP from running afowl on legislation without achieving consensus from other parties in some capacity.  Populism only goes so far.   We need to avoid the tyrany of the majority which is what the Senate's job is, albeit they're kinda shitty at it to be honest."

I can't trust my vote to the Liberals since I don't know if the they'll swing right on some of my key issues."

People simple don't pay enough attention to the issue to really care.  Remember that the 2011 election was called because the conservatives were caught in Contempt of Parliament which literally means they fraudulently lied to the opposition and thus Canadians. The conservatives went on the win a majority. I know that Ignatieff severely bungled his campaign, but the fact still shows that Canadians don't pay attention to anti-democratic behaviour because we have such a cynical view of politics that we simply dismiss it as all the same."

If we're going to talk about peoples understanding of democracy we should get the facts straight.  Contempt of Parliament simply means any ""misconduct"" that is not a breach of privilege.   In this instance the Liberals and NDP claimed cabinet withheld proper documentation from them.  Contempt of Parliament is a joke and can be used to mean literally anything so long as you have the votes behind you to push it through.

Contempt of Parliament is a joke and can be used to mean literally anything so long as you have the votes behind you to push it through.    By that logic, the passing of legislation is also a joke.

Apart from that, I'm not entirely sure they're comparable.   For the CPC, the opposition was basically judge, jury, executioner as well as plaintiff.   That was not the same for what happened to the NDP. I'll admit, there are similarities but as I said, I am primarily concerned with contempt of parliament being so ill-defined. The only thing that can happen to the NDP realistically is pay back the money. For contempt, the House can actually discipline as a whole which leaves space for far more partisan abuse."

No other party was directly involved in this, whereas for the CPC it was literally those individuals making the report to committee that were the ones who decided if what they received warranted, in their eyes, a ""contempt of Parliament"".  There's no rule that the Opposition parties could point to, no metric apart from their own idea of what constituted satisfactory compliance.  For the NDP, we can literally point to House officers, NDP staff, rent cheques, pay cheques, Members budgets, bylaws, etc.  It was far more concrete, if not ""fair""."

It could say ""the sky is green"" and so long as they have the votes it goes to committee. Read the CPCs dissenting report.    I just read the evidence of the witnesses  There it seems abundantly clear that the dissenting report was simply the government party attempting to whitewash the cabinet thumbing their nose at parliament. The dissenting report does nothing to address why the government did not give reasons for denying the release of the documents. If you read the evidence, you will see that cabinet can deny the release of documents, as long as it gives reasons for doing so. In this case, the cabinet did not give any reasons for doing so and that was one of the main reasons the opposition could even take this issue as far as it did.   In addition, producing the information requested only when forced to by the committee convened to investigate why the information requested was not produced, nor a good reason given, does not make everything all right.    Passing legislation is and always will be serious.   Indeed it is. Any time the cabinet does not give members of parliament the information they need to make a decision that is a very serious breach that deserves a serious response. Which this was.     Contempt of Parliament is and always be a nonsensical slap on the wrist. Its a catch all term that can literally mean whatever you want it to. Its the procedural equivalent of jay walking. That is what I mean.   I think you are incorrect in your characterization of contempt of parliament. Jay walking happens all the time - contempt of parliament has happened only 5 times for an individual in Canada and never for a government (before this incidence). That leads me to believe it is a very serious charge and it is dishonest to compare it to jay-walking."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,Neumann347,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"They clearly cited cabinet confidence as the reason they didn't give the information out.   And here is a perfect example of the opposition parties not willing to cooperate.  From the committee report:   The government indicated that it was willing, in the case of some information, to waive Cabinet confidence and allow certain documents to be made public. Members opposite noted that, on the other hand, the information tabled by the government was insufficient as compared with the information requested in FINA’s order for the production of papers and documents. That same day, during the Business of Supply, the House debated an opposition motion ordering the production of the same documents demanded by FINA. This motion was subsequently adopted in a vote held on February 28, 2011, setting a deadline of March 7, 2011 for the production of the documents in question.   TL; DR: Even though cabinet cited the legitimate concern of cabinet confidence but were willing to waive it, we still want what we originally asked for. Even though its all protected under cabinet confidence.   Then, after documents were provided, they were ignored and the report was written anyway.  What we have here is a clash between the practice of Government and Cabinet Confidence. While you are correct in that witnesses did say Parliament needed to do its job, many of the witnesses also pointed out that cabinet REQUIRES secrecy.   People are also never ticketed for jaywalking, doesn't stop them from doing it. Go read Obrien and Bosc and what they have to say on the matter. It can literally be used to define an MP refusing to sit down when asked to. It is so broad its ridiculous.   Edit: At the end of the day it comes down to cabinet convincing opposition that they are justified in holding back those documents. If the opposition had it in their mind from day 1 to find them in contempt there is absolutely nothing the government could have done to stop them."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,ThusShatZarathustra,4,Tue Jul 21 20:15:58 2015 UTC,"On Cabinet Confidences:   As to Cabinet confidences, although the concept was not defined in the Canada Evidence Act, but rather through tradition and practice, Mr. Walsh stressed that the House of Commons is not a court of law and is not bound by this Act. In the parliamentary context, it was up to Parliament to decide whether the costs associated with the bills introduced by the government constituted Cabinet confidences. Mr. Walsh pointed out that, until a bill is introduced in the House, the costs associated with the bill could be considered a Cabinet confidence. Once a bill is introduced in the House, however, this was no longer the case since MPs needed to be able to state their position on the bill. Insofar as a decision can only be as well-founded as the information upon which it is based is complete, Mr. Walsh stated that in order for MPs to exercise their right to vote in an informed manner, they may require this information.   The cabinet needs to give good reasons beyond cabinet confidence for not delivering some documents:   The Speaker noted that in his view, the documents provided by the government on February 17, 2011 did not constitute all of the information that had been ordered by FINA. While he found the lack of response on the part of the government on this matter to be “unsettling,” he stated that what was of greater concern was “the absence of an explanation for the omissions.” He noted that on page 281 of Bourinot’s Parliamentary Procedure and Practice, it states that:  [U]nder all circumstances it is for the House to consider whether the reasons given for refusing the information are sufficient. The right of Parliament to obtain every possible information on public questions is undoubted, and the circumstances must be exceptional, and the reasons very cogent, when it cannot be at once laid before the houses.[6]   That person you were talking about who supported cabinet confidences also said this:   Mr. Cappe also maintained that the government’s decision to invoke Cabinet confidence had been unjustified.    When the guy who is gung-ho for cabinet confidences says they don't apply here - there is a serious problem.    And here is a perfect example of the opposition parties not willing to cooperate.   I don't understand this example. You are saying that parliament passing an opposition's motion (introduced a month later) to produce the information requested is an example of the opposition not cooperating? That seems more like the government realized it had done wrong and is now trying to make sure it isn't called to account, without actually having to acknowledge wrongdoing.     It can literally be used to define an MP refusing to sit down when asked to. It is so broad its ridiculous.    Contempt of parliament can be wielded in the example you have shown, but it never has been used that way. It is used for very important transgressions - like not releasing documents that MP's need to make decisions regarding their vote on legislation."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,Neumann347,0,Tue Jul 21 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"There is a conflict between these two that need to be addressed.  Here's the full context of what Cappe said from his introduction to the committee. Emphasis mine.   There are two issues I'd like to address. The first is the question of cabinet confidences. I heard the conversation this morning with the law clerk and the Information Commissioner. I want the committee to understand that I'm a big defender of cabinet confidences, and I think that it is necessary for good government to have candour in cabinet exchanges. Frankly, it's been recognized by Parliament. Parliament passed the Access to Information Act and chose not to exempt cabinet confidences, but to exclude cabinet confidences, so when the government claims privilege on cabinet confidences, I think the're doing the right thing. It's recognized by Parliament in section 69 of the Access to Information Act. As well, there's an absolute exception, which I know Mr. Walsh talked about this morning, in section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act, which states that the clerk, with absolutely no review or restriction, can claim confidences of the Queen's Privy Council to be exempt.   Given the wording of Mr. Brison's motion and the finance committee's request for information in which you asked for “documents”, I can understand that it could be possible for the Prime Minister and the government to have interpreted this as a request for cabinet documents. As such the government claimed privilege and said that cabinet confidences will not be released. That was a legitimate response of the Prime Minister.   Again this boils down to interpretation. Mr. Cappe said what the government did was legitimate. It all depends on who's glasses you're wearing. This was a procedural black hole."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,ThusShatZarathustra,17,Tue Jul 21 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"Contempt of Parliament is a joke and can be used to mean literally anything so long as you have the votes behind you to push it through.

CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,amnesiajune,2,Tue Jul 21 19:23:44 2015 UTC,"Well it's different in the sense that impeachment actually has serious consequences, compared to being found in contempt of parliament.

Because of that, a government being found in contempt of parliament is a statement without any weight."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,Gripencourt,4,Tue Jul 21 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"Contempt of Parliament can carry imprisonment, though I don't believe that it's been done in Canada in a very long time."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,scshunt,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:34 2015 UTC,"Impeachment isn't any more serious than being found in contempt of Parliament. It's essentially just a majority vote that charges an official with the offenses outlines in the Articles of Impeachment. At that point, like our House can hold a vote of no confidence in the government or a vote to expel the member, the US Senate holds a trial and then voted on whether to convict or acquit the person being impeached."
CanadaPolitics,3e33vy,amnesiajune,2,Tue Jul 21 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"Its a joke for exactly that reason.  Other opposition parties in other parliaments respect the institution enough to not do that.

Protip: They aren't but the opposition went after them too just so they could say ""Government"" instead of ""Minister of Justice and Minister of Public Works"". That is literally it.

In those circumstances the opposition parties would find the particular ministers who did not ""produce adequate documentation""* responsible in contempt which is in line with Parliamentary procedure.

In such a referendum, the ""no"" side always has an advantage because of fear of change and having to explain the new electoral system.  If we got a government in who campaigned on electoral reform, and they delivered it, I don't see how there would be huge backlash.  On MMP itself, I believe it has merit.  I feel it's at least a step forward from FPTP.  One of the problems with our current system is that so many votes elect no one -- this would still be the case in the local riding side of things with MMP, if not with the regional-proportional part.  I kind of like the idea of a ranked ballot system (because of the issue of ""hey my candidate wasn't even in the running but I'd rather have the #2 guy than the guy who won"" that can happen after an FPTP election), but I'm not sure if something closer to ""correct"" proportionality would get achieved with that or not....  What I'd kind of like to see is an MMP system where you chose a party for your proportional region, and then had a ranked ballot for the direct/local seat."
CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,arvy_p,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"The problem with the combination (which I also consider preferable) is figuring out what votes to count for the overflow seats.    edit 4: My preferred option at the moment is sort of complex, and would need some study to see how it behaves practically, but I'll present it anyways. It is motivated below. Basically, you'd have a single preferential ballot containing both local candidates and parties:   Local candidates would need 50% of the local vote to be elected, while parties would need (more or less) [50% of regional votes] / [number of regional seats].  The election would proceed by electing any local candidates who've reached the 50% threshold, and then fractionally distributing any remaining votes in the riding to the regional election based on preference.    So if 60% vote for the winner, then all the opposition votes, and 1/6th of each vote for the winner would be distributed to most preferred party on the corresponding ballots. Any votes that get eliminated entirely due to not having a party preference would be removed from the regional total as well.  If any party has enough regional votes to elect a member to a seat, then the party with the largest percentage of the regional vote gets allocated a regional seat.    The amount of votes available to elect regional members from each riding, combined with the amount already used to elect regional members, shall not exceed 50% of the vote from that riding. The percentage of the total vote for the selected party needed to allocate it a seat is removed fractionally from each of the ballots cast for it equally. If 50% of a riding's vote has been used to elect regional members, then the remainder of that region's vote will be redistributed to the next local candidate indicated on the corresponding ballots. If all the regional seats are filled, or a party gets eliminated, then that party's remaining votes get redistributed to the next preference indicated on the corresponding ballots. Any vote that is eliminated due to not having a next local member preference will be removed from the riding total as well.  If no more local candidates can be elected, the local candidate with the least percentage of their local vote compared to all candidates running in the region is eliminated.   If the last local candidate for a party has been eliminated, and the party doesn't have enough votes to win a regional seat, then it is eliminated as well.      Preferred option motivation  You could make it so that people have a single combined preferential ballot for local candidates and regional parties, and run both elections concurrently, but that seems like it would be complex, and since proportional elections are designed to consume as many ballots as possible, you might have only a limited number of votes returning from the additional member election back to the local ridings, making it unclear without trying it out how much impact this would have compared to not having preferential local elections. [edit 3]This might be counteracted by the fact that you'd likely have many more votes enter into the additional member election than you actually need, resulting in a glut that can go back to local elections as parties are eliminated and/or the additional member seats are filled[/edit 3]. [edit]Also, this means that local elections will be affected by how the regional elections go, which may of may not be undesirable. It would be voluntary for each voter, of course, but the impact this has on local candidate elections would have to be studied.[/edit] One point of complexity is determining when to eliminate a party vs a local candidate. You can't just order them by percentage of the total vote, since parties have a much larger electorate than local candidates, [edit] but also because parties are likely to be second choices, so they'd be eliminated almost immediately, which would likely prevent small parties from getting seats. You'd probably have to wait until all local candidates for a party are elected or eliminated before eliminating a party[/edit]. [edit 2]You'd also have to prevent the case where more than half the votes from a given riding are allocated towards electing additional members, since this would prevent a local candidate from being elected with 50% of the local vote.[/edit 2]  edit: You could make parties always the first choice, but I think it would be better if people could choose a local candidate they like first, which brings us back to the previous, complex system.    Other options  A common solution is to count everyone's ""party"" vote irrespective of who they voted for locally, and then eliminate the amount of the vote for each party corresponding to the number of local seats it won before using them to allocate overflow seats. The problem with this is if two parties cooperate, then one can run local candidates and the other can run additional member candidates. This way, rather than topping up parties which are underrepresented, the additional members are effectively distributed proportionally by themselves, which significantly undermines the effectiveness of the system in proportionally allocating seats. Various additional rules can be put in place to combat this, but they tend to be to varying degrees ineffective or undesirable.  Another solution is to make the party vote automatically the same as the party of the local vote, but this might be too restrictive, since it might force people to vote based on a party locally where they'd rather vote for a local candidate. It also doesn't interact well with preferential local elections, since you could vote for the 'additional member party' as your first choice and the 'local party' as your second on the basis that the 'additional member party' is unlikely to win locally, effectively doubling your vote similar to the previous system.  You could try to eliminate votes (potentially fractionally) which were used to elect a local candidate and only use the remainder to elect additional members, but this discourages people from making a second choice locally, since that might consume their vote, when they'd really prefer it went towards electing a list candidate from their preferred party."

CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,hobbitlover,13,Tue Jul 21 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"Before the pro FPTP/IRV crowd comes out with their misconceptions I must reiterate these myth busters:   0) There is still local representation in MMP. Just ask Angela Merkel or John Key what riding they represent. We could even add in Trudeau's IRV lean to this and elect the riding MPs via IRV.   1) MMP does not have to use an ""unelected party list"". There's an open list, where voters can choose who from the party candidates get elected on the ""top up"" seats. Alternatively, the German state of Baden-Württemberg elects the ""best near winners"" from the riding races to the top up seats"".   Not to mention the strong possibility of implementing a ""Canadian made"" solution to rectify this problem such as electing the top up members through STV. Yes, Germany and New Zealand have lists, but there is nothing preventing us from adapting our own solutions.   2) ""It causes political instability."" You can say that when looking at Israel, Belgium, and Italy but the countries functioning just fine with it vastly outnumbered those sparse cases.   In the case of MMP countries Scotland, Wales, Germany, and New Zealand, elections there have been held with more consistency than here.  3) ""MMP would require a constitutional amendment as it changes the amount of seats allocated to each province.""

Personally, after thinking it through, I prefer Jenkins-esque MMP (with some modifications). The ballot would look like this but you can also rank your regional top up MPs. The regional MPs for a party would be elected by STV.   TL;DR: You vote for a riding MP by IRV. You vote for regional top up MPs by STV. If say, the NDP needs 2 top up seats, a mini STV election is held within the NDP regional ballots to declare the 2 NDP winners."

I don't think Mulcair could be much more explicit about his designs, I mean he seems to get some flak around here about not having a detailed platform out, but as it regards this issue he's been pretty damn clear.  First, we elect representatives, this is hardly a direct democracy, we neither need nor have referendums on an issue by issue basis, except in rare, typically constitutional, cases.  Second, I think items explicitly campaigned on have considerably more legitimacy than say the Conservative reforms to the Elections Act that they never once mentioned when seeking office.  It would be more dubious for Mulcair not to reform our electoral system after going on and on about this being our last FPTP election."

Second, I think items explicitly campaigned on have considerably more legitimacy than say the Conservative reforms to the Elections Act that they never once mentioned when seeking office.

A certain number of people who might want / not want reform will vote for a party that does not represent that interest because of other concerns. The number who do so is unknowable.   It would be more dubious for Mulcair not to reform our electoral system after going on and on about this being our last FPTP election.   I'm all for Mulcair (or Trudeau) working for it as it is in their platform, but without a referendum the legitimacy of this change is compromised.  New Zealand made the change after two referendums, followed by another to reject the option to change back to FPTP.

The magnitude of the change would be profound, far more so than this-or-that budget measure which would be trivial for a subsequent government to undo.   How about declaring war.  How is going to war less profound than changing the electoral system?  In terms of undoing a reform, it actually is pretty trivial.  BC did it in less than 2 years when they adopted and then dropped a single member ranked ballot.  Manitoba switched to FPTP with just an act of their legislature too, and they had some multi-member ridings too.  As did Alberta.  This isn't the stuff nightmares are made of.  Electoral reform is easily achieved when there is a desire to do so.  The people who benefit from the status quo rarely have the desire to do so though.   New Zealand made the change after two referendums, followed by another to reject the option to change back to FPTP.

CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,OrzBlueFog,5,Tue Jul 21 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"We don't need a near-unanimous vote though.  Just a simple majority.   All sides must be considered in such a debate, pro and con.   Labour held a Royal Commission, which they said they would implement until it came back with MMP.  Then they shelved it.  In stepped the Nationals, who while also opposed to MMP, promised to put it to a public vote.  Then they made it a two step process instead of an up or down vote.  But in the end they did follow through.  In this case though a referendum was a tool to push reluctant MPs forward.  Not to mention, since when is governing by referendum a good idea? Look at the transit referendum in BC.  Or every referendum we've had federally.  Conscription, prohibition, Charlottetown - our country collectively lost its shit in each of these.  No thanks."

The magnitude of the change would be profound, far more so than this-or-that budget measure which would be trivial for a subsequent government to undo.   The government often makes decisions of great scope.  C-51, public pensions, whether or not to go to war, public healthcare, etc.  We elect representatives to make decisions of scope.  If this is some greater beef with representative democracy, that's fair, but as long as we have a representative democracy creating a list of what you can or can not do without a referendum would be:  A: Kinda arbitrary, which matters are significant enough?  You've pointed out electoral reform, surely I'd add going to war.  Where do we stop?  and B:  The constitution already basically has this list for us, amendments don't require a referendum, but in practice, let's face it, they pretty much do.   As electoral reform is not the sole item in each party's election platform I cannot agree. A certain number of people who might want / not want reform will vote for a party that does not represent that interest because of other concerns. The number who do so is unknowable.   This mentality calls the whole legitimacy of elections into question, how do we hold governments accountable except for what they campaign on?  You can't be serious that because we don't know which specific issues each voter likes about their party all of their decisions are suspect?  Once again this is an appeal to direct democracy, which is cool if that's you're jam, but it's not mine, and I don't think we need a vote on each and every issue for accountability.  Furthermore, who the fuck votes for parties they have significant disagreements with?  If I agreed with every last thing the NDP campaigned on except for their one statement that they would ""throw out all the Mexicans"" (a deliberately obtuse and untrue example) I wouldn't fuckin' vote for them!  I'd look for a party without such significant breaches or an independent if necessary.  At worst I've spoiled ballots in the past because the parties have these significant issues I can't abide.   I'm all for Mulcair (or Trudeau) working for it as it is in their platform, but without a referendum the legitimacy of this change is compromised. New Zealand made the change after two referendums, followed by another to reject the option to change back to FPTP. That Canada could legitimately make such a fundamental change with a vastly lower threshold is not something I can support.   I think I've demonstrated that the legitimacy statement is absurd unless you intend to call all of representative democracy into question.  But also, we're not New Zealand, the rules for reform are clearly laid out here in Canada and we simply don't need to have a referendum.  Additionally, New Zealand is one example, not every government to change systems has held referenda, or even campaigned on it.  /u/CupOfCanada pointed this out vis-a-vis B.C.'s changes in the past."
CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,_Ogopogo_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:00 2015 UTC,Decisions that effect how you pick the people who make future decisions are always inherently going to be of dubious legitimacy if a group gets in and simply pushes through a rather substantial change which will be of great benefit to them in the future.
CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,Palpz,3,Tue Jul 21 20:49:26 2015 UTC,"Good thing MMP, at least for the NDP, isn't   of great benefit to them in the future.   The NDP are proportionally over-represented in this government, and if they were to be able to move MMP forward they would likely need a majority this fall which will once again mean they're over-represented.  If the NDP is one of the privileged two parties in our two party system and they were truly serving themselves rather than the independent best interests of Canadians then they would be advocating the status quo.  At this point, if the NDP actually stick to their guns regarding MMP they will the only party not advocating their self-interest:  FPTP gives the Conservatives the most seats under current conditions,  IRV gives Liberals the most seats under current conditions,  MMP gives the Greens the most seats under current conditions,  MMP costs the NDP seats under current conditions, they'd be best served by FPTP."
CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,_Ogopogo_,2,Tue Jul 21 21:10:31 2015 UTC,"In fact, IRV would hurt the Conservatives the most, something the NDP would like, and benefit the NDP more than MMP would according to 338: http://www.threehundredeight.com/2014/12/the-seat-implications-of-electoral.html?m=1"
CanadaPolitics,3e33q6,justalurkingredditor,2,Tue Jul 21 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"I stand corrected.  Still not best served by MMP, it's too bad MMP is what's best for the country."

Well, given that one party majorities would be rare under proportional representation, it would likely require the support of multiple parties to change things back.  But other than that, nothing really.  And that's been the norm for Canada, for better or worse.  BC, Alberta and Manitoba have each changed electoral systems multiple times.  Forgoing a referendum is a live by the sword die by the sword kind of thing.  Easier to make the change, but easier to reverse it too.  So opponents of reform needn't wring their hands too much.  At the very least though, it would remove the incumbency bias enjoyed by our majoritarian status quo."

I personally think it should be PR if you win 40% of the vote you get 40% of the seats.  Example using 2011 Results with 2015 seats  Total Seats = 338  Conservatives 39.62% = 133.91 Seats  NDP 30.63% = 103.69 Seats  Liberals 18.91% = 63.91 Seats  Bloc 6.04% = 20.41 Seats  Green 3.91% = 13.2 Seats  Party with the highest amount of votes will get rounded up until the number of seats is reached(if above 5)  Conservative = 134(+1)  NDP = 104(+1)  Liberals = 64(+1)  Bloc = 20  Green = 13  3*  Note Forces et Democratie has 2 seats currently in the case of a seat short they should be handed out via popular vote so example, if they are 4 seats short the Conservatives, NDP, Liberals, and Bloc will recive an extra seat. This could happean if a party dosen't meet the threshold % of the vote, in my opion it should be 2%-4%"

CanadaPolitics,3e326i,Hoarse-horse,7,Tue Jul 21 16:07:51 2015 UTC,Ahem.   Cote says his office did not pursue complaints from other parties that the NDP used free parliamentary mailing privileges to distribute the partisan missives -- a matter that is not regulated by the Elections Act.   That's the more relevant piece to the complaints of the other parties.
CanadaPolitics,3e326i,ParlHillAddict,7,Tue Jul 21 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"That's the more relevant piece to the complaints of the other parties.   So then why did they complain to Election Canada about it? You surely can't be suggesting the CPC didn't understand the scope of EC, as that would imply the ""fair elections act"" is built on a foundation of ignorance about how EC operates...   And seriously, it's bit rich the CPC Libs would bother to complain about partisan mailouts from the NDP... I live in a CPC riding, I get their mailouts. Plus yesterday we had Pierre - Santa Clause - Poilievre rocking his CPC golf shit at government photo-ops, all day long.   The fact that Elections Canada found that not only did the NDP pay out of pocket for the ones issued during the writ, but they also made:   ""genuine efforts""   to recall the ones issued before hand, speaks pretty strongly in favour of their behaviour.   I'm not sure how to link to it, but Althia Raj has a photo of the letter sent to the head of the NDP clearing them on her facebook page. In it, Cotes mentions what the ""partisan"" nature complaints were about: web site links.   Complaining about web site links, on a physical mail out.   Again, I disagree with the mailouts. Shouldn't have happened. However, complaining about this is a pretty solid definition of petty."

CanadaPolitics,3e326i,Hoarse-horse,5,Tue Jul 21 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"I can only assume they asked Elections Canada about it because they wanted to cover all bases. They also went through the BOIE, which, well.... people have issues with that ruling as well.  I agree with you in that the CPC is rich in its complaints because they don't have legs to stand on. As to the Pierre Poilievre thing, Kady O'malley has an article about why it was okay.   The mailouts issue, as far as I know, shouldn't have links to partisan websites. They can link to government websites that are highly partisan but cannot show links for the CPC/NDP/LPC/GPC, etc. No idea about logos and what not. I don't think it's a huge issue myself but it is against the rules.  My problem with the ""genuine effort"" is that this is a recurring theme with the NDP where they have been caught doing something wrong but have claimed ignorance of rules or that it was an innocent mistake and it has allowed them to get away with things. The Ontario NDP MPP who used his office as a gathering point for example; here it's mailouts sent at times outside allowed times; then it's hiring people to work out of satellite offices, which isn't allowed. I can't believe the last one is getting such a free pass as the hiring forms apparently ask specifically whether or not the new employee is working from the HoC or the constituency offices. The NDP checked either one of those boxes and had those individuals working in other offices entirely."

CanadaPolitics,3e326i,Hoarse-horse,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"The mailings could not be sent within the byelection period unless they are claimed as campaign expenses.

I can only assume there ""genuine effort"" to recall them has allowed them to not have to claim them as campaign expenses and therefore they aren't being penalized for it.   I'd prefer a defined line of when it is okay to send mailings out before elections/byelections, such as no mailings a week before, to ensure something like this doesn't happen again.

They could use the time limits on calling a by-election to create a defacto 'freeze' on opposition mailings for fear their mailings could be sent 1 day too close to the writ.

Freeze mailings out a week before a byelection and everything is fine.    This is because in some cases it is impossible to know exactly when a by-election is going to be called.   While it is impossible to know exactly when a by-election will be called there is still plenty of time to send or not send mailings. I have yet to see a by-election be called a week before the writ is dropped if you can provide evidence to the contrary then great.  There is nothing indicating specifically why they haven't had to claim them as election expenses other then a genuine effort to stop them.    Other mass mailings to residents of Bourassa and the Manitoba riding of Brandon-Souris were sent within the official campaign period and Cote says they were properly reported as campaign expenses by the NDP.   As this quote from the article indicates, other mailings did have to be claimed. Not sure where the NDP were at in regards to their limit but if the EC had found them to violate the timing then those costs would have gone towards their expenses and may have pushed them over. It would be great for clarification.    That'd be impossible and would give the governing party an advantage over opposition parties, since they ultimately decide when the by-election is called.   Again, I have yet to see a by-election called in such a short time that the other parties have been totally unprepared. Basically when a seat goes vacant they find a candidate and funnel money to it. The writ period is announced somewhat in advanced and I have yet to see a drastically close time frame. Show me otherwise.   I absolutely agree. As I've continually said.   You mentioned this in the first comment that is it. We agree. I proposed another option that allows mailings but avoids confusion on expenses that is totally plausible."

With gridlock ensnarling the GTA and costing us more than $6 billion in lost productivity annually, Olivia knows that action is needed by all levels of government.  As the Official Opposition Federal Transport Critic, Olivia tabled a bill in Parliament to establish a National Transit Strategy aimed at achieving fast and affordable public transit through long-term, predictable investment.  After decades of under-investment, the establishment of such a national framework for federal transit dollars would finally bring Canada up to par with its G8 peers.  Olivia’s bill received widespread support from mayors, transit operators, unions and advocacy groups from across the country with dozens of high-level endorsements and thousands of petition signatures signed.  Replacing current ad-hoc and unpredictable federal funding for transit projects, the bill would have established a permanent mechanism to determine transit needs across the country, mandating the federal government to work together with provinces, municipalities and First Nations communities.  Toronto and the GTA would benefit tremendously from such a non-partisan and permanent approach to federal transit funding. Instead of a trickle of partisan-guided federal investments, a fair and objective approach is direly needed.  Olivia took her passion for better public transit to the next level when she ran municipally in 2014.  With too many people waiting for jam-packed buses in the cold, improving bus services was one of her central campaign planks. Through more frequent bus service, Olivia pushed for reduced wait times and overcrowding and ultimately a more humane commute in large parts of our city.  Likewise, Olivia has been championing the building of the long-needed subway relief line to ease overcrowding on >our subway system and expand the system in a way that’s long been demanded by experts.  Guided by expert advice that rapid transit is urgently needed in underserved parts of the city, Olivia continues to >advocate for cost-effective and fast light rail lines. Building light rail in Toronto will finally bring rapid transit to >areas like Rexdale and northern Scarborough.  With the growing inequality in our city, building a fair and wide-spanning transit network is more important than >ever."

I would say that many though are very much experts, my member of parliment is the critic for parlimentary reform, Craig Scott. I know he is a Rhodes Scholar, and he is a proffesor of law. I would also say many of the other critics are also experts. Nikki Ashton(shadow critic of aboriginal affairs, (an expert on that), Françoise Boivin the justice critic founded a law firm, I could go on.

They don't ask about reform at all because apparently it's too difficult for voters to understand what that means. Do a poll with reform as an option along with abolition and let's see the results.
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Hoarse-horse,4,Tue Jul 21 15:10:07 2015 UTC,I strongly suspect Vice worded the questions that way in order to get the response they wanted so Ling could write this article.

No that isn't the problem with reform. The problem is it could mean many things. Say someone supports reform in the way of ""an Elected Senate"" and nothing else. That person should not be lumped into reform with the Trudeau crowd. They have a different belief and often favor abolish over the reform Trudeau supports. Why would that person who favors abolish over Trudeau's ""reform"" be lumped into Trudeau's reform crowd? It makes no sense."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,trailerparkfan,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:14 2015 UTC,"You are making my case for me. Reform is too broad so they don't ask about it. But without some question on reform, the polling is skewed because it's incomplete to the options."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Hoarse-horse,0,Tue Jul 21 16:09:53 2015 UTC,With Reform it is skewed as well though.
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,trailerparkfan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:46 2015 UTC,It would at least capture some level of reform versus not capturing it at all. The last poll that actually asked about reform showed the greatest proportion of people who took that poll preferred reforming vs abolition. I'm not sure why VICE can't make an actual poll that looks into that as well.
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Hoarse-horse,4,Tue Jul 21 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Just throw in the status quo and each of the major parties' proposals, and ask which of the following options voters prefer:   Keeping the Senate with Senators appointed by the PM Keeping the Senate with Senators appointed by an independent committee Keeping the Senate with elected Senators Abolishing the Senate   That's not too hard to do"
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,amnesiajune,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"Those are not the only ""options"" for reform though. You also have appointed by the Premiers, change the house to Proportional Representation and the list goes on. Reform polls well because there are so many options for it some which even I might support if put on the table. In the end though the question becomes ""if your type of reform isn't put forward do you favor abolish""."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,trailerparkfan,3,Tue Jul 21 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, but you can leave out the other options for the same reason that polls leave out the non-mainstream parties - a long roster of options is confusing, tiring, and decreases the poll quality.  There are four realistic possibilities given that one of the three major parties will certainly win the election - no change occurs, or one of the three proposed changes occurs. Those four possibilities are good enough to do a proper poll"
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,amnesiajune,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"Also, what's so difficult about adding in a script for online polls that allows more questions for people who choose the reform option with extra questions looking at different types of reform.

CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Issachar,3,Tue Jul 21 17:45:35 2015 UTC,"If you read section 41, the only mention of the Senate involves the number of Common seats a province is required to have with relation to Senate seats. There's no subsection that explicitly forbids the changing of the Senate's role in government under that section.  For the changing/devolution of powers, section 42 is the relevant section, and that refers back to section 38, which employs the 7/50 rule."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Oafah,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:21 2015 UTC,Is there a slight chance you may be incorrect? Are you open to that possibility? The Supreme Court ruled that unanimous consent of the provinces is required. I'm sure they've read section 41 and I'm sure they interpret it more accurately than you do.  Additionally the NDP is not proposing to effectively abolish the senate via neutering it so I'm not sure why that is even relevant.
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,daxtermagnum,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"I took a look at the SCC decision, and he's more or less correct. From the decision:   Within the scope of s. 42 , it is possible to make significant changes to the powers of the Senate and the number of Senators.  But it is outside the scope of s. 42  to altogether strip the Senate of its powers and reduce the number of Senators to zero.     So they could significantly reduce the role of the Senate with the 7+50 formula. To what extent is an open question."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,QuizzicalButthead,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"It matters because technically, they can use general procedure outlined in section 38 to achieve the same end goal, even if it still results in having a bunch of powerless old people sit in a bunch of red chairs.  I'm not necessarily saying they'd take that route, but I'm saying it's an option. Stripping Senators of the power to vote on bills would be a reasonable compromise in the event of a lone dissenting province or two."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Oafah,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:46 2015 UTC,"I think any attempt to significantly reduce the Senate's power (i.e., make it so they are not required for passing legislation) would easily be considered close enough to abolishment that the SCC would rule against it.    You cannot ""neuter it to the point of irrelevance"" with only 7 provinces.  You can reform it with consutative elections or term limits with 7, but not significantly reduce their powers."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Iustis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Well it would ultimately be up to the SCC, but I think the language is pretty clear on the subject.

CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,Oafah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Someone I suspect that the Supreme Court would not consider that to be constitutional.  Taking away all the powers of the Senate to ""effectively"" abolish it is unlikely to be found to be constitutional when abolishing the Senate requires unanimous consent.  Granted, I'm not an expert on this subject, (I suspect that neither of us are), but if it was so simple to effectively abolish the Senate without unanimous support I think somebody with some credentials and authority on the matter would have thought of that."

The most recent poll I can find that breaks support out by province / region is from [April] (news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/majority-of-canadians-support-either-abolished-or-reformed-senate-poll). Support for abolition seems to have grown since then, but regionally there is certainly still extremely high support for 'reform' as opposed to 'abolish'. There is no guarantee that enough of those 'reform'-minded citizens would vote for abolition to carry the day in every single province.  There's also the logistics of organizing what are, in effect, 10 separate 10 provincial referendums over the objections of some of the provinces. I doubt Mulcair would want to antagonize Quebec that much."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,OrzBlueFog,7,Tue Jul 21 15:04:13 2015 UTC,"Vice's poll breaks it down by region. With the exception of Alberta, oddly enough, every region has a majority of respondents saying they're favorable to politicians promising abolition. I wish they had more questions clarifying where people stand on the issue, but there seems to be, at the least, widespread openness to abolition. If Mulcair framed the debate as being between abolition and the status quo, I think he would succeed. The Liberals' reform plan is toothless, and the CPC have no plan, so there's a strong case there. I once again want to emphasize that success would not be easy.   There's also the logistics of organizing what are, in effect, 10 separate 10 provincial referendums over the objections of some of the provinces. I doubt Mulcair would want to antagonize Quebec that much.   I'm very out of touch with Quebec, but this really seems like an inside baseball issue to me. Once the referendum campaign gets underway, would people really object to it being held? People think that more choice is good, in my experience. The bigger danger is the referendum passing in Quebec while failing somewhere else. High risk, high reward."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,QuizzicalButthead,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:30 2015 UTC,"The constitution guarantees 33% of the senators to the province of Quebec, even though the demographics of the country has very much changed since, bringing QC's pop at only 23% ( if I recall correctly). Without a senate, we are litteraly electing a Monarch, most probably one we din't agree with. Actually the only thing that could work for Quebec is the current senate in a working condition, and not being a partisan club de l'age d'or. But it's irrelevant considering how politics is all about power rather than serving the people. Also, a reformed senate would decrease the (potential) power of Quebec in a working senate. So it's pretty much shit for us all regardless of how you look at it."

Polls like this betray implicitly accept the possibility that 'abolishing the senate' is a realistic possibility.   The theory goes that, if a Prime Minister were to try to get the provinces on-board for abolition, a single hold-out—like Quebec or PEI, both of whom are wildly over-represented in the Senate—would block efforts to get rid of the upper chamber.   It's not a theory, this is literally what killed Meech..   Yet advocates like Bernier and Mulcair might be on to something, if this Forum poll is any indication.  A majority in every area of the country, except Alberta, said not only would they support abolition, but that they'd be looking to line up behind a leader who promises to get it done. And the two areas of the country often cited as the hold-outs, Atlantic Canada and Quebec, are the most likely to say so—60 percent of the East Coast and 61 percent of Quebec.   Well unfortunately it's not up for a popular vote or we could have killed it years ago. Abolishing the senate depends on unanimous consent from each provincial legislature, the house and the senate itself. That's the rules of the game set out by the court, and as a just society where the courts decisions hold value, we need to abide by that.  So, Canadians want a PM who will abolish winter, and the senate. Does that mean we should pay attention and respect someone who promises to do so? I say no."

CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,OrbitalStrikeBadger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, a technocracy of sorts? I think if Canada should maintain a 'Senate' (even if its vastly different in form and content), a 'technocracy' would be the appropriate avenue.   However, that presents a number of challenges; who deems a senate appointee legitimate or not? For example, I'm not convinced Chris Hadfield would be appropriate material for a technocratic senate - I love the man to death, but I'm not necessarily sure he has the right credentials to weigh in on most of the topics that go through the senate.   Would members be elected in the same manner as they are now? If so, what's to stop the government from electing more Mike Duffy's? What if they argue that theoretical-Duffman is the right guy for the job?  I certainly don't disagree, but a technocracy falls into a lot of the same pitfalls we already have."

Eventually I think we could move toward a merger of a technocratic senate with direct democracy, where the senate would create several plans and the people would vote between those plans, but this would have to be some future point where we've reached ubiquitous computing.  Hypothetically the age of ubicom would usher in a new age of ubiquitous education in which the average person would have access to the knowledge necessary to make decisions directly, without the need of a representative but without the minutia of voting on every small little thing and instead voting on overarching strategies as constructed by a senate of specialists."

Reforming it is very subjective, if we place teachers in the upper house, why aren't we than placing union activists, or why is there no northeners?   This also begs the question if these Canadians that you say are ""Non Political"", why is that? Why can they not get involved? Should we not make a more inclusive democratic chamber which allows for philosophers, STEMs, Journalists, Farmers, Blue and white collar workers, doctors to represent people at a greater level(Who are probably more representative of the larger population)"
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,LondonPaddington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't reforming it far more difficult than abolitioning it, as there is no consesus of how we want representation.    Yes and No - As far as reforms go, if you can get 7 provinces to agree representing 50% of the population, you can drag the remaining provinces along kicking and screaming.  Abolishing the Senate requires unanimous consent of all provinces, so one holdout province with 1% of the Canadian population can stop it."
CanadaPolitics,3e2itc,ndpfanboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"Well why didn't Stephen Harper touch the reform card, because there is no consensus on what reform is, and provinces don't know what they're getting into when they are opting for reform. Opening the reform bag means that there is about a million possibilities in which some of them may be worse than what we have now. Some provinces may feel like they may loose all possibilities of the representations.   The Auditor General's report stated that the senate had serious structural problems as an institution itself. It said that any reform of laws would be not enough, as the entire thing is too vauge. I don't think Justin Truedeau would able to clearly deliver, clear reform. I think clear reform would entail a structural shift of what it means to have an unelected house in our democracy and really shifting who we want to be represented by. I just think reform of this institution is such a big door to open in a democracy, and people want a clear option to this plauged chamber.   Reforming the senate because reform is easier than abolishiment, is misguided. Reforming into a chamber that projects the values Canadians want in the 21st century will be incredibly difficult."

Either way, this is not a problem for the PM to solve, the Court saw to that.   PM Harper, since he could no longer do as he willed on the matter by himself washed his hands of the matter and said that the onus was now on the provinces.   The Court placed the onus on the provinces, it is not Harper's fault the Supreme Court made their horrible decision.  If Harper washed his hands, it is because the Court left him no other option.  The same will apply to Prime Minister Mulcair, and his naive or manipulative promises he cannot keep.   In our federation, constitutional change has always been a matter between the two levels of government, the SCC simply reminded the PM of that fact.   You really should read the ruling.

They say the bill attempts to give CSIS the ability to get a warrant in secret that pre-authorizes violations of the charter.    I don't see anything manifestly unconstitutional about this.  The warrant-issuing judge would be charged with assessing constitutional grounds of the request at the time of the warrant.  The argument here seems to be that C-51 purports to grant new powers, but an equally plausible alternative is that it doesn't, and that the warrant mechanism is a means of advance review for proposed conduct that may not pass constitutional muster.    They draw issue with the fact that twenty-one Canadian agencies have the authority to share or exchange personal information without any accountability or transparency.    Data privacy is not a broad constitutional right; it is a right granted by the Privacy Act and other statutes.  The only place that the Charter could interfere would be if the information shared is of a uniquely private character that would ordinarily require judicial authorization, but which is collected for some other express purpose.  Maybe medical records?  Aside from that, I see no constitutional challenge to conduct such as (say) CBSA notifying CSIS of travel to particular foreign countries.    They raise concerns about new provisions under the bill that give the government the ability to hold secret hearings relating to people the government is trying to deport and say the bill would limit the information available to special advocates working on behalf of the person being deported.    This is not the proper time for such a challenge; it should be raised when a person is actually being deported.  Then, the court will be in a position to know the actual effects of these provisions and whether they hinder effective representation.    They do not support Secure Air Travel Act legislation which authorizes the government to have a no-fly list with the names of Canadians and, according to Cavalluzzo, evaluates the appeals of people who have their name on list in secret without representing their interests before a judge.    Again, this would seem to be better-placed for a challenge after someone has actually been put on a no-fly list and had their removal request ignored or denied.    Finally, they do not agree with amendments to the Criminal Code which create a new offence of “promoting terrorism in general.” Cavalluzzo said the term is too vague and will limit journalists who write about national security.    ... and again, a challenge that would be much more appropriate when someone is charged with promoting terrorism.  Actually convicting someone will require courts to decide what conduct counts as impermissible promotion rather than protected speech, and it is a case-specific determination based on the facts at issue."
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,Majromax,3,Tue Jul 21 14:49:37 2015 UTC,"the CCLA did an AMA recently where they fleshed out their position on the judicial authorization system. IIRC its pretty much the same as Kent Roach and Craig Forcese's position which is on their website. Off the top of my head, the relavent differences are that warrants do not authorize violations of the Charter, but rather mean that actions are not violations. That distinction is written into ss. 8 and 9 which permit reasonable searches.  Roach and Forcese explain it better than me, but it should be very clear that Blaney's repeated claims that this mechanism acceptable on the same basis as a warrant is a novel legal argument that I don't think will survive judicial scrutiny.  again, I don't think they need a representative plaintiff or defendants of accused. The special advocate system was actually invented by a court in a case called Charkaoui -- the evidence they used to invent it came from other jurisdictions and the testimony of experts, not from the ? Plaintiff in that case. Furthermore, Charter litigation is driven by hypotheticals and as I said above most of these questions revolve around statutory interpretation, like do the the secret hearings violate the right to counsel. IIRC, a case called matsqui Indian band is on point here wrt the non-necessity of actual misconduct when the court is acting prospectively.    *I really diagree with your last point. The question before the court is whether ""terrorism offenses in general"" is overbroad. They don't need an offended for that. It doesn't have anything to do with any particular factual scenario, it has to do with the words. This is a s. 7 claim not a s. 2 one"
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,macamareva,6,Tue Jul 21 15:12:13 2015 UTC,"It also increases the exchange of federal security information, broadens no-fly list powers and creates a new criminal offence of encouraging someone to carry out a terrorist attack.   Didn't the RCMP encourage a couple (man/woman) in BC to perform acts of terrorism?  Yup  C-51 needs to go."
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,Oderdigg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"How is that case related to C-51? The powers demonstrated by the RCMP in that scenario existed before C-51, and will continue to exist.  And a claim of entrapment is unlikely to be successful in that case. From what I've read the courts tend to give police broad leeway in how they conduct string operations."
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,Gripencourt,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see this challenge going anywhere right now.  I completely agree with the argument that C-51 raises some very interesting Charter questions, but it's not clear that the bill is manifestly unconstitutional such that it could never be enforced in a valid manner.  Courts are usually very reluctant to hear challenges about hypothetical application of legislation, since it's much more difficult to build a proper evidentiary record.  When the impugned provisions of C-51 are actually used, there will be a much better factual basis to see how those provisions impact Charter rights.  Since legislation passed by Parliament is presumptively constitutional and for the public good, I don't see how any significant provision will be blocked prospectively."
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,Majromax,6,Tue Jul 21 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"the Charter permits declaratory relief. The CCLA needs standing, sure, but I think public interest standing is made out.  I've read an overview of the claims on the Star article and they are all questions of law. At least with respect to the overbreadth analysis, you don't need the factual basis to which you refer -- you don't need any accuseds or defendants to find facts pursuant to statutory interpretation, ie, whether the provisions are overbroad.  even if this wasn't prospective, it would still be argued using hypotheticals.  the presumption of constitutionality applies to any exercise of statutory interpretation and I think here will be conclusively rebutted. imo the public good presumption is mostly irrelevant."
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,macamareva,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"the Charter permits declaratory relief   Simple declaratory relief would not be satisfactory, the CCLA will obviously want offending provisions read down or made inoperable.   The CCLA needs standing, sure, but I think public interest standing is made out.    Not on all the issues, I think.  They might have standing for the CSIS warrants and data sharing (since those are secretive), but for deportations, air travel, and the offense of promoting terrorism private interest standing would be much more applicable.  The first and last get judicial review anyway, and the second has no access to justice barrier.  Within the two provisions that I feel have the best chance of public interest standing, I don't think data sharing is going to go anywhere.  It's difficult to make out anything but a speculative breach of the Charter, and even then the breach would be in how agencies use shared information rather than the sharing itself.  The warrants might have half a leg to stand on, but the CCLA is challenging the mechanics of advance judicial review for constitution that may otherwise breach Charter rights.  I can't see these provisions being overturned, but possibly they could be clarified such that the warrant judge should apply a proper s.1 test for the conduct being sought.  (I think that's a given anyway, but obviously some don't.)"
CanadaPolitics,3e2d48,Majromax,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't potential violations of Canadians' Charter rights under C-51 not likely be known to the person in question given that we're talking about spies / top-secret processes / private court hearings / etc?

The child-fitness tax credit (to name but one example) is the contemporary equivalent of a shot of rye.   I think its an interesting situation, because most are well aware that this is 'vote buying' in some manner or another. And its likely happened every election since the shot of rye days. But for some reason this election cycle it seems to be more blatant and more obvious than ever before.

Generally speaking, the government has not opened or expanded programmes aimed at delivering services to ordinary Canadians.  Therefore, to target a demographic via money, that money almost has to be returned via cheque.  Rather than a warm fuzzy feeling about (say) funding for universities, we get to quantify how much the governing Conservatives love each demographic by how large of a tax credit they get."

They are simply returning a small portion of what they stole from them in the first place.   If I write the government an income tax cheque for $3000 every three months, but then they send me a $160 every month... did the government really give me anything?  This is just a little tax cut for people with children. And it's more welfare for the poor who are net takers from the government."

CanadaPolitics,3e33ya,covairs,8,Tue Jul 21 18:24:26 2015 UTC,"As the marginal rate is less than 100%, I don't think that is correct. The rich do pay most of it back, as do the not quite rich, and the doing OK but not nearly rich. This is why it is such a stupid benefit to begin with."

CanadaPolitics,3e33ya,Surtur1313,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"Welfare is where the government gives someone more money than they collect from them in taxes. If the government collects a $1000 cheque from you, and then sends you back a cheque for $160, the government hasn't given you anything. They've just taken $840 instead of $1000.   On the other hand, if you haven't paid the government any tax money, and the government sends you $160 more than they were sending you before, they've just increased the welfare payment.

That's a bit misleading - you used to get a $2,255 non-refundable tax credit, but what you actually got was just that amount at the lowest tax rate, and only if you were paying that amount in taxes. The effective amount was around $340 per child.  Anyways, replacing it with the UCCB is actually a progressive move. The Child Tax Credit was regressive - you could only claim it if you earned enough income to do so (in other words, people with an extremely low income were ineligible) and everyone above that income level got the same $340. Now everyone, including the poorest people, will get the extra $720, but you pay taxes on it, which makes it as progressive as the tax rates are."

I'm not saying you have to cheer for each other, but at least recognize that the enemy of your enemy is, if not exactly a friend, a person you're going to have to work with tomorrow."
CanadaPolitics,3e25m8,ziggy1283,20,Tue Jul 21 12:04:29 2015 UTC,Yes but approximately 40% of NDP voters would vote Liberal as their second choice.  Whereas only 19% of Conservatives will vote Liberals as their second choice.  Attacking Harper is more of a way to rally core supporters than it is to snatch votes but attacking Mulcair has the chance to push the Liberals out into the front like they were back in february when the NDP were down around 19%.
CanadaPolitics,3e25m8,Vihvillain,11,Tue Jul 21 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"That graphic also shows that if both the LPC and NDP focused on the CPC, they could take 19% and 16%, respectively, from them.  But yes, ultimately, the LPC wants to win, and they are probably more likely to get voters currently learning NDP.  But with a minority government being the most likely outcome this October, you probably ought not to push too hard against a party that is likely to hold the balance of power if your party wins."
CanadaPolitics,3e25m8,ziggy1283,6,Tue Jul 21 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"It's true that the LPC and NDP can shift some CPC votes, but they both are far more likely to nab votes from each other.  It also really won't matter post election if it's a minority as there will be two roughly equally size parties that the government can play to for support.    Imagine if the current CPC government was a minority, the NDP would have voted against C-51 regardless of any chances made to it so in order to pass it the CPC would have made some ammendments that the LPC would have demanded in exchange for their support."

My prediction? Despite the polls there's a lot of time left and the CPC is good at making comebacks. I'm almost positive we're going to see another split vote for the center-left while the CPC wins a minority. A temporary coalition with the goal of bringing in proportional representation is the left's only real hope here."

There are plently of ""blue liberals"" that would rather side with the CPC any day of the week, and there are members of the NDP that would rather stay in opposition than side with Bill C-51 supporting liberals.  Even if they could work aside those fundamental differences there's just no way they could agree on electoral change.  Despite the fact that they both want to implement or examine an alternative to first past the post they both have strong preferences for different models based on how it would impact their chances.  If you look at this article from 308.com's author you'll see that the Liberals would overwhelmingly benefit from preferential balloting.

Everybody is used to it going the other way around; even if a lot of NDP supporters like Trudeau and would strongly prefer a Liberal government to the CPC, it's expected and accepted that the NDP will claim ""Liberal, Tory, same old story,"" etc.  Liberal supporters also often kind of like Mulcair and the NDP. Liberal attacks on the NDP so far, however, had been relatively low-key, with Trudeau preferring to frame the election as a two-way race. Now that the red team has switched targets more explicitly, we'll see if casual Liberal supporters are as comfortable with these sorts of attacks on the NDP as New Democrats are with NDP attacks on the Liberals.  So while this isn't entirely fair, the LPC might be risking a backlash in attacking the NDP that doesn't occur the other way around. You see the same thing between the NDP and the Greens; I've noticed a backlash on Twitter whenever the NDP attacks the Greens, but not so much when the Greens attack the NDP."

Health care is different because people can seek treatment at any time. Many poor and middle class Canadians do not work 9-5 jobs and therefore will still need to find child care at unconventional times. The Liberal plan is tailored towards giving families more flexibility when it comes to childcare.   I think the word progressive has been hijacked by socialists.

My point is just that nobody – not the LPC, not the NDP – should assume they'll win once voters ""wake up"" because their ideas are obviously better.

This is because, while I'll concede that the unions have broad social interests that they pursue, they have special interests as well, and given sufficient political clout they will act like any other special interest to promote those interests. That includes using their influence to ensure the continuance of superfluous and obsolete jobs. Take for instance, the locomotive fireman.  Old time steam locomotives, you needed an individual who would shovel wood or coal into the firebox. Even after the advent of oil-fired locomotives and mechanical stokers, you still needed a professional to maintain the fire and ensure efficient combustion.  But this was not the case once diesel and electric locomotives were available. However, the political influence of the unions was such that the railroads could not get rid of the firemen, and so labor costs made higher so that a man could be paid to shovel coal into a diesel engine, to the detriment of comparatively clean, efficient transportation of passengers and goods.  This situation lasted up until the 1980s, forty years after the age of steam, when the railways were finally able to be rid of such employees, reducing transportation costs and making the economy more productive.  This story repeats itself in many industries where the unions are able to use their political influence to mandate the continuance of jobs for narrow, especially interested reasons."

The class system in Germany is very entrenched and their vocational training system plays a role in entrenching it.  European workers also have the right to be refunded the portion of their fees used for political activities.  So the trade-off is greater unionization, but less union control of business practices.  The union's role is more to guarantee minimum pay and working conditions in an industry.  And under those provisions union coverage is near-ubiquitous.

Unfortunately, the North American labour movement has historically, to my knowledge, been treated far more hostile, by and large, by 'industry', and even government, than it's European counterpart.

CanadaPolitics,3e2vcg,OrbitalStrikeBadger,3,Tue Jul 21 17:21:28 2015 UTC,"The very concept of 'special interests' in Canadian politics is a rather outmoded way of understanding the relationship between the state and society. It emerged on the scene with Charter-skeptics or Charterphobes who were concerned that the political process was being undemocratically hijacked by particular groups at the expense of the whole. This discourse was primarily leveled at groups like the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, EGALE (LGBT group), Women's advocacy groups, and organized labour (primarily what this group is about). This conceptual framwork has been used to a more limited extent by those attempting to understand business interests in the Canadian political process, though not generally from the Charter skeptic camp.  In short, this idea of 'special interests' is fundamentally a social conservative conceptual framework emerging from a resistance to socially progressive forces organizing and mobilizing in the political process.   The truth of the matter is that interest groups and (more broadly) social movements, or 'special interests', are actively involved (and have been for quite some time, even before and outside of the context of the Charter) in the policy making and policy analyzing process at all levels of government. Government and the public service are constantly in communication and dialogue with sectoral, regional, and issue based advocacy though policy networks and policy communities.   The odds are that when you read articles like this on 'special interests' what you'll find is concealed partisan-political rhetoric (from the left and the right, though mostly the right) rather than a nuanced or institutional concern for democratic legitimacy."

CanadaPolitics,3e4074,d-boom,5,Tue Jul 21 19:57:07 2015 UTC,"Well that doesn't seem very difficult, really:   He says the Liberal party agrees with the Supreme Court's 1998 decision that a referendum result needs a clear majority for Quebec to secede from Canada.   The issue has always been that ""clear majority"" is an intentionally vague term. For all Trudeau likes to spin it otherwise, neither the Clarity Act nor the Liberal Party's current positioning approach ""clarity"" in any demonstrable way. There has never been any attempt - excepting the NDP's - to quantify the required majority. Claiming that the intentional maintenance of this imprecision is in some way an act of ""clarity"" certainly requires impressive mental gymnstics.  After all, the SCC say:   The task of the Court has been to clarify the legal framework within which political decisions are to be taken ""under the Constitution"" and not to usurp the prerogatives of the political forces that operate within that framework.  The obligations identified by the Court are binding obligations under the Constitution.  However, it will be for the political actors to determine what constitutes ""a clear majority on a clear question"" in the circumstances under which a future referendum vote may be taken.   Bear in mind that the stated positions of the parties that will, in the event of a referendum, constitute the ""yes"" side (the PQ, unless there is a QS government) and the ""no"" side (the PLQ, unless the CAQ form opposition to a PQ government, which I don't think would change anything) are unanimous in support of the principle of 50%+1. Bear in mind that the paragraph I have included above here very clearly states that it is for the ""political actors"" to decide what is a clear majority. Presumably the chief political actor apart from the leaders of the ""yes"" side and the ""no"" side would be the government of Canada. In this case, there are only two positions that the government of Canada can take: the first is to be in accord with the provincial players on the stated terms of the referendum, and the second is to be obstructionist and to demand, on high, a different standard than that agreed upon by the leaders of both the ""yes"" and the ""no"" campaign.  Realistically speaking, how does Trudeau and any other Clarity Act supporter feel that that would play out were it come to pass? Would it aid the ""no"" side to have a federal government insisting it would not recognise the referendum result under the same terms as the ""no"" side itself would? Or would it in fact send moderates running to the ""yes"" side, with the argument that the federal government is unwilling to play fair and to trust the judgement of the provincial parties, that the federal government does not recognise the democratic will of the Quebec people?  For those who will invariably point to polls suggesting that x percent of Quebecois also support a higher threshold: has the question ever been asked which level of government ought to enforce that threshold? Given that the entire question revolves around the moral right of the federal government to speak for the people of Quebec, the question is hardly a trifling matter. Uniquely among federal parties, the NDP recognises that the federal government opposing the ground rules as established by both the PQ and the PLQ is by far the most effective way to aid the sovereigntist cause in the event of a referendum."

Acting as if there exists some broad consensus that could be obtained on the project if only we had a more amicable person on the job is naive to the point of idiocy.  Much of this commentary can be applied to many of Trudeau's positions on issues like this. The LPC has done a good job on specific policies like the Child Care Benefit etc but when it comes to things like Energy East Trudeau is still incredibly vague. His general strategy seems to be to say the CPC has mismanaged the file and say his approach will be more vague positive things (collaborative, respectful, positive, etc) to the point where one has no idea what a hypothetical PM Trudeau (the second) looks like or how he makes decisions."

CanadaPolitics,3e2pbj,the_fresh_prints,0,Tue Jul 21 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's very relevant to highlight some very important facts when speaking about veterans.   The New Veterans Charter, which was introduced by the Liberals and endorsed by all parties in the House of Commons, became law shortly after the Conservatives were elected in 2006. It replaced a system of lifetime pensions for disabled vets with one that relies heavily on lump-sum payments. That prompted some veterans to say the government treats the soldiers of long ago more favourably than those who are retiring today.   Why did they do this? Aging World War II and Korean War veterans.  These veterans were starting to push into their 70s and 80s and still receiving a pittance of a monthly pension for their service.  Thus the ENTIRE House of Commons voted for the LIBERAL Veterans Charter to grant veterans lump sum payments so they could give something to their children and grandchildren.  While this was happening the Afghan surge was occurring and more Canadian troops were being deployed in combat missions in Kandahar.  Our 20 and 30 year old Afghan veterans were coming back with hearing loss, PTSD, and other physical injuries from combat.    At the time the ""new"" Veterans Charter only supported lump sum payments, thus these 20 and 30 year old veterans were getting lump sum payments (as approved by the unanimous House of Commons) as they exited their military.    Veterans Affairs finally realized that giving 30 year olds a lump sum payment and telling them they had to live the next 35-45 years as a disabled veteran wasn't the best idea and thus Erin O'Toole's changes came about.  The NEW fixes now allow for lump sum AND monthly benefits to injured veterans as well as special payments for critically and 100% disabled veterans.  But of course this isn't as good as a sound bite as ""Harper Conservatives disrespect veterans and take away their monthly benefits"""

We shouldn't be so ideological where we prevent cost-saving measures.   I agree. Most of Europe uses some form of mixed system and many of those countries get better outcomes for less money.  Health care is difficult to deliver cheaply and effectively. Large government bureaucracies have their problems but at the same time it is hard to set up an effective market to harness market forces. The level of costs involved inevitably result in someone other than the patient, be it insurance company or government, picking up some or all of the costs of healthcare. That makes it really hard for price signals work. Furthermore for better or worse people feel that health and life have immense, possibly infinite value. People are even less rational about health decisions than the limited rationality displayed in other economic areas. Ultimately there is a balance that must be struck between a top down bureaucracy and a bottom up market driven methods of delivery. Finding that is however very tricky."

CanadaPolitics,3e0m42,alessandro-,4,Tue Jul 21 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"It's a little oversimplified. Canada does rank pretty close to the top among OECD countries for the amount of money we spend on health care.   There are lots of ways you could measure quality, though, and different measurements put us in different places. The ratings that are least flattering to Canada, such as a ranking done by the Commonwealth Fund recently, tend to put Canada low because (if I recall correctly) those ratings put a lot of weight on using electronic health records, which Canada doesn't do a great job of. But low uptake of electronic health records doesn't necessarily translate into bad patient outcomes, which is what we really care about, so it's questionable whether the harsh penalty Canada pays in such rating systems actually reflects problems we should worry about.  On the whole, though, it seems a matter of consensus among the health care policy wonks I've read that Canada has higher-than-average health care costs and only a pretty meh level of quality—not awful, but not great either.  Whether switching to a ""mixed system"" would improve out health care outcomes is a different question from that of how well we rank compared to other countries, and I haven't seen anything that makes me think that striking down the laws forbidding physicians to mix accepting private funding with operating with the public system would improve our health care systems in any sizeable way.  There's lots of ways you could frame the ""public vs. private"" debate when comparing Canada to other countries: Canadian provinces do have rules that strongly discourage doctors from operating with private funds whereas European countries don't, but on the other hand, rather greater proportions of total health care spending—not just for physician and hospital services, but also for pharmaceuticals and dental services—are paid for with public money in France and Germany than in Canada. (In Canada, about 70 percent of health care spending is publicly funded, whereas it's just under 80 percent in the other two countries. And in other countries such as Sweden and New Zealand, the public proportion of spending is higher still.)   TL;DR: Health care policy is complicated."

We'd probably need to find the methodologies and dig deep into them, or even call people at the respective organizations, to find out what happened. I took a look back at the OECD health stats, and if you look at per capita, US dollar PPP health care spending, we're also not as close to the top, even in 2008, as the Conference Board of Canada depicted.  So I'm willing to retract the statement that we're near the top, but most ways of taking health care statistics do put is in the top half among OECD countries. Our place relative to other countries will depend not only on the methodology used, but also on whether the metric for health care costs used is US dollar PPP or percentage of GDP spent on health care."

You also seem to be conflating a whole bunch of things. We're talking right now about a report on the federal government's role in health care. The federal government doesn't have anywhere close to a worrying level of debt, and it's not expected to—there's just nothing to be concerned about on that front. If you're worried about health care costs, those are a concern, but not because of aging: if you look at page 35 of this report (it's a PDF) on Ontario's health care cost growth in the years 2000-2011, you'll see that only 0.9 percentage points of the 6.7 percent average annual growth in health care spending could be attributed to aging. That is, aging was the reason for only about a seventh of the increase in health care costs. The most important cost drivers are (1) that health care involves a lot of labour, and in Canada we tend to pay that labour well, and (2) whenever we get new health care technology, we tend to want to make use of it, and using new technologies costs money. So we're spending more, but we're getting way better care than people would have gotten 50 years ago.  For what it's worth, the federal government does spend a lot of money on pensions, but it does a good job of making sure it collects enough in pension contributions to be able to fund its benefits. The Canada Pension Plan is quite parsimonious (i.e., not ""lavish""), and because it's parsimonious it's expected by the chief actuaryPDF to be sustainable at current contribution rates at least until the year 2090."
CanadaPolitics,3e0m42,KennyMcCormick99,-2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the funded debt, the Federal Government has a lot of unfunded liabilities. They're on the hook for all the bad mortgages through the CMHC. They're on the hook for all the bank deposits through the CDIC.   As the economy continues to crash, tax revenues go down and expenses go up. All the government numbers are based off of unrealistically rosy economic assumptions. They don't factor in things like a housing bubble crash or an oil price crash or any of that sort of stuff.  Ultimately, both the Federal and Provincial governments are not going to be able live up to all the promises they made. Their plan is to try to make the Canadian dollar as cheap as they can so that they default on their obligations in real terms (but not in nominal terms).

That's why it makes sense to price your assets in US dollars (or some other stable currency or benchmark). The US dollar has been a pretty strong currency since around 2008 and it's still the world's reserve currency, so it's appropriate to use that as a measuring stick for valuing an asset. That could change in the future, but for right now, it's still the measuring stick that the world uses to value its assets."

CanadaPolitics,3dz4y8,Gears_and_Beers,13,Mon Jul 20 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. California's total revenues for 2015 are $111 billion USD. Ontario's revenues for 2015 are $118 billion CDN The ratio of obligations and revenue are actually pretty comparable.

Now, that doesn't mean Ontario's fiscal trajectory is good..."
CanadaPolitics,3dz4y8,CupOfCanada,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"That isn't actually true.

Not exactly.  Your obligations are set by the jurisdictional boundaries between civic government below you, and federal government above you.  Within those two lines lies what you are obligated to pay for AND what power/freedom you have to levy taxation to cover those costs.   California may have that 2Tn GDP, but it's only currently generating 111Bn out of that pile, so it's barely touching the economic activity of the state (5% or so).  Ontario, on the other hand, taps 118Bn out of 700Bn, or 18%.  Why?  ON has to pay for health care.  If CA had to pay universal health care for its citizens at the rate that ON does (5616/person as of 2014), it's health expenditure alone would be 217Bn CAD or 168Bn USD.  Add that to their current obligations, and they'd need to raise 279Bn a year.  Taxes would clearly have to go up significantly."

CanadaPolitics,3dz4y8,Eilanyan,11,Mon Jul 20 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"It's a little tricky, since at the very least income taxes are actually decently high in Ontario. Besides the marginal rates, the surtaxes on said marginal rates mean that those in the top brackets are paying nearly 50% at the margin between Federal + Provincial, and going above that generally starts getting into the levels where people start picking up and moving or using tax avoidance strategies heavily.   We'd mostly have to extract the extra value from lower earners, and even then once you're getting to 80k to 90k tax marginal rates jump 10% in that zone. Raising tax rates below that starts getting into the types of families that are generally already pretty stretched. Whether you consider that a side effect of people not being responsible enough on perfectly average incomes or whether you note that Canadian families are generally overstretched on their own indebtedness, particularly around stuff like real estate, it's still difficult economically and suicide politically to do so."

Also we could just look at reducing deductions, non-regressive fees, higher consumptions tax, etc   It probably is political suicide but that is in part because of how much the right has won when selling off public assets is more popular then tax increase.

I mean, we already have a lot of people moving there because it's the best way to make a lot of money; if we start trying to squeeze too hard on our top earners, we can expect to see a lot more in the way of brain drain."

For example, when the CAD was worth 63 cents US, the tax rate differential between equivalent paycheques ($100k CAD in Canada, vs. $63k USD in the USD) was quite large. And realistically, in a lot of professions salaries are actually higher in the US nominally, so things get magnified."

I think the real trick with the tax curve thing is that there's no magical number that makes the taxation too much, and it's really going to depend on transaction costs of moving vs. the cost of the taxation differences. It was probably a lot harder to raise taxes in Ontario in the last few years where it might have been the last straw before people packed up to Alberta for all that petro money and low taxes. With the collapse of the oil boom and a government in Alberta that might be forced to raise taxes to balance the hole left by that it might give places like Ontario a bit of flexibility to tweak rates without incentivizing moving as much.

I suspect a lot of the jobs shed have been contract jobs. Given that contract workers are often more productive than non-contract workers (they're often younger, less established, and obviously the need for renewal drives higher performance), that's actually even worse.  *edit* If you look into it further, almost all federal government job cuts of the last few years have been by attrition, i.e. not hiring replacements for those who leave or retire. Given that people who are unproductive and coasting are among the least likely to leave for other jobs voluntarily, this is actually just about the exact opposite of the type of cuts we would ideally want.

It's more subtle than that. Most of my experience is with public sector clerical (office) workplaces, where I estimate something like 20% of non-managers and probably even more managers could be eliminated with minimal damage to effectiveness. It's the public sector IT business analyst who pushes around irrelevant reports all day while enabling almost no actual technology work; it's the manager who attends 5 hours of meetings a day at which he/she does basically nothing. These types of employees are a constant feature of every public sector workplace I've ever experienced; everyone knows it, and nobody can do much because of how difficult firing is in the public sector.  As I've said, it's not like the private sector is immune to waste. I worked at a software company a few years ago where I figured probably 30% of the managers were basically useless. The difference is that eventually as the company started struggling, it figured out which 30% was useless and one day a few months after I left, the company laid all of them off. This is the part that doesn't happen in the public sector. Everyone knows there's a big chunk of useless people. Often, they know who the specific people are. But efficiency doesn't improve."

There are multiple mechanisms in the private sector, but none of them are likely to be effective in the public sector, since they are almost always driven by the sorts of financial incentives whose absence is a large part of the reason for the public sector issues we see.  For example, often a company's financial performance becoming poor motivates a detailed, top-down look at costs, including reducing payroll cost, and this often exposes the less effective employees that might coast on unnoticed when the company is performing well. And ""poor financial performance"" doesn't just mean the company has to be about to go under - often third party investors or financial analysts will put public pressure on boards and management if they perceive that the company is underperforming. The extreme version of this are the proxy fights for control that can see entire boards thrown out and replaced by new boards who the shareholders deem better able to improve the finances. Obviously, this entire process has no analogue in the public sector. There is no risk of a poorly run public sector company having control taken by people who can manage it better."

Then, you have to add in the fact that a huge number of voters are employed by the government without any commensurate ownership stake - i.e. even if we imagined an analogous situation where employees owned a large number of shares in a private company, it's not the same because in the private company, the employee-shareholders know that they will both have no job and no equity value if the company goes under. But the government won't go under that way - worst case situation we end up like Greece, and while nobody wants that, for the average highly compensated public sector worker it might be a better outcome than earlier, more voluntary austerity (at least in their eyes)."

The number of government employees who do little to no work of value is staggering. Why are we not looking for cost savings there?   The problem is you can't make the public sector more efficient just by cutting budgets from the top down: Mike Harris already squeezed the Ontario public sector as much as he could.

Nor are there any incentives that would push the employees in those units to participate in those cultural changes, particularly if they involve increased efficiency. The whole public service is almost entirely absent normal efficiency incentives, which is a huge part of the problem.  Also:   Mike Harris already squeezed the Ontario public sector as much as he could.   This is definitely not true, or even if it is, is not particularly relevant data for our current issues.

Breaking the unions is neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the kinds of outcomes that we all want.

CanadaPolitics,3dz4y8,d-boom,15,Mon Jul 20 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"That article makes me want to tear my hair out in frustration.   “The real wages of Ontario public sector workers have declined in real terms (fallen below inflation) since 2009 by a cumulative -4%,” said Toby Sanger, senior economist with CUPE on Tuesday. “Yes, Ontario public sector workers gained some real wage increases in the eight years before then, but that came after nine years of real wage losses of a cumulative -6.5%. Since 1990 Ontario public sector workers have received had an overall real wage increase adding up to 2.5%.”  That works out to 0.1% a year, far less than more CEO or the rate of inflation, he said.   Yeah, except for the fact that the 0.1% a year is a real wage increase, not nominal, and therefore already accounts for inflation. Which means that all of these people are making 2.5% more at every level, in every position, than before - after accounting for inflation.  And this is a CUPE senior economist. Not that this is surprising: pretty much the only role of a public sector union is to demand better compensation for its members, completely regardless of whether or not the compensation currently paid is already reasonable - or much more than reasonable. Even their economists will be purposely misleading and present only supportive data, with this end goal in mind.  I think it is high time to look at curbing the strength of public sector unions in Canada.

That said, the phenomenon of unnecessary public sector employees is absolutely real, and it exists in every public sector workplace I've ever encountered. Sure, I've run into some incredibly inefficient private sector workplaces too - our big banks are dripping with tons of lazy under-utilized employees and useless paper-pushing middle managers - but inefficient and unnecessary workers are a near-universal characteristic of every single public workplace. Pretty much any productive person who has worked in both private and public sector functions knows this to be true.

The employment mechanisms of the provincial government probably needs reform to ensure that we're getting a reasonable amount of output out of employees, and clear standards for dropping people who can't keep up with a reasonable output. But that's a question of reforming the hiring and firing practices of Ontario public service. In time, hopefully that'd automatically lean up the public service by increasing individual output to reduce the levels of employees needed for a baseline level of necessary productivity.  As for cutting back on over-allocated resources, I'm a bit fan of that. I think this one in particular is common at the municipal level, with stuff like the Toronto Police being increasing despite drops in crime. There's certainly room there to ease off. The question is if there are similar departments for the Ontario government that could likewise also make due with cuts. Unfortunately the big costs there seem to be education and healthcare, and both don't seem to have that much extra room to cut without vastly increasing classroom sizes or wait times."

For example, we all know that a lot of public safety functions (police, fire) are enormously over-funded in lots of parts of Ontario. Yet many right wing ""cost cutting"" types will refuse to touch policemen or firefighters. That has to change: we need an evidence-based policy of cost reduction.

Also...    The nation’s most-populous province is keeping a goal of spending $130 billion over the next decade on work such as roads and mass transit in Toronto even after S&P dropped its credit grade this month to the lowest level ever. Yield spreads on some of the province’s debt reached the widest since January after the ratings move.    ... widest spreads since January?  That's really weird.  If Ontario were seen as newly-vulnerable to credit risk, then I'd expect yields on its bonds relative to Canadian federal bonds to be reaching multi-year or multi-decade highs.  It's not like default is an everyday occurrence here.    “It’s not free debt,” Mario Angastiniotis, an analyst at S&P in Toronto, said by phone Thursday. “The P3 is just an alternative vehicle for financing, it’s not a different way that doesn’t cost you anything. You’re still adding to your debt.”    ... no fooling?  I did not think this was a question.  P3 are not usually intended to reduce the cost of infrastructure, they are intended to ensure stable costs (with the private side exposed to construction delays and cost overruns).

An AFP process may have cost more upfront, but it likely would have prevented the costlier budget overruns, and we would have had finished infrastructure in use by now. That's the value.

I do not think, given his clear motivation to understate salary increases and the fact that he is provably misleading about the number, that the 2.5% figure should be taken at face value. I would be particularly interested in what 1990 represented in terms of Ontario compensation spending - it seems quite likely that he chose an especially highly compensated year as a baseline."

CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,Likely_Lost,15,Mon Jul 20 20:41:42 2015 UTC,It is due to a non replacing birth rate. We incentivize having children along with high immigration in order for our country to grow. If we didn't than things like CPP and Healthcare would quickly become untenable due to an older population shrinking our tax base.
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,bongwaterjimmy,0,Mon Jul 20 20:46:46 2015 UTC,Isn't out population already growing? I'm confused.
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,C21H20BrN3,8,Mon Jul 20 21:07:52 2015 UTC,"Our birthrate has fallen below a replacing rate of 2.1 and our growth is due mainly to immigration. Previously, natural increases i.e. people having lots of children, used to be a significant factor in Canada's growing population but naturally born Canadians tend to have fewer kids now. Since we bring in immigrants our population still increases. This is necessary because low immigration and a low birth rate will lead to an aging population and a situation like Japan. This causes issues because as people reach the retirement age there are more people taking advantage of government programs with less people contributing taxes to pay for said services. In order to avoid this we bring in large amounts of immigrants to offset our declining birth rate in addition to providing incentives for having children. To answer your question, our population is growing but mainly due to immigration and these incentives.

Why else, then, would we have progressive tax rates?  This leaves the question of whether the gov't wants families to have children or not.  If yes, then they should be supported through tax policy.  If no, then there are a lot of deductions such as daycare that we can eliminate."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,taxrage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, I agree with you. But not everyone thinks the government should encourage families to have children through tax policy, so we shouldn't start the discussion assuming this as an axiom."

CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,taxrage,19,Tue Jul 21 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"On balance, the Liberal plan provides a greater benefit to all income groups up until $150k of family income IIRC. The party provided a bunch of details illustrating this here."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,EngSciGuy,10,Tue Jul 21 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"I would like to see better numbers comparing the NDP and Liberal plans. I was trying to compare them somewhat but I couldn't find a good stat on how many daycare aged children there are in Canada (oh stats can, why is your website so fail).  Taking average costs it seems the poorest parent still is on the hook for ~$4k a year per child for daycare under the Liberal plan (though limited spaces being the catch for the NDP plan)."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,EngSciGuy,12,Mon Jul 20 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is that spaces still tend to disproportionately go to higher income groups if Quebec is an indication. You could use their stats as assumptions as to benefits in other provinces, but I think part of the problem is that we don't quite know who will get the new spots, so how can we compare?"
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,EngSciGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:11 2015 UTC,The Quebec numbers are also outdated since they implemented the progressive pricing scheme (I think just last fall?).
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,TheDarkDub,8,Mon Jul 20 20:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yes and that presents yet another problem, if each province is different or can choose one of any number of models, how can you compare that to the LPC plan? Are some spaces going to be progressively priced but with a maximum of $15 a day? It could be if a province wanted it."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,EngSciGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:35 2015 UTC,Though then that brings up if the two plans should even be compared? Although both involve children are they just so unrelated practically that trying to do direct comparisons is almost moot?  Perhaps the nearest way of comparing is the Liberals approach is for the private market to sort out daycare and the NDP want it handled publicly?
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,TheDarkDub,4,Mon Jul 20 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the nearest way of comparing is the Liberals approach is for the private market to sort out daycare and the NDP want it handled publicly?   Best way I've heard it explained. The LPC plan has far less strain on the system. It's far easier to cut a cheque monthly, then regulate the free market. The NDP want to build the entire thing from the ground up, which would take years to be effective, if ever.  I like the LPC plan the best, because as the article said, it's a solution that makes sense."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,Eilanyan,3,Mon Jul 20 21:33:39 2015 UTC,"Eh, the flip side is does it actually help people get their kids in to day care? Maybe it will drive down costs as more competition appears. Maybe cost will increase since there will be more demand and the daycares know parents are getting more of a transfer.  The amount the parents have to pay is still pretty significant even after the Liberal bump in transfers, so will we actually see that many more kids even going in to daycare?"
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,EngSciGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:13:06 2015 UTC,"Hard to predict what the free market would do. I'm actually so far away from daycare that my personal experience is very low. I wish I knew more.  As far as I can tell, the Liberals are taking an approach to level the playing field by giving non discriminatory. The NDP haven't even come out and said how the limited placements will be obtained. First come first serve, lottery or buy-ins? Unless everyone gets it, you shouldn't call it universal."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,Eilanyan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:27 2015 UTC,"I think doing both is good. There are flaws with both, but given the Liberal plan does help even the poorest (thought it was only for people who paid taxes), and NDP plan does help everyone (again, can argue how progressive or regressive it is), they are both moves in right direction."

CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,kofclubs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"Not too far off but more then the statistics show is currently being used.  54% of 1.5 million is 810,000.    Chart 3 in the original link though is whats impossible to figure out, essentially that location is the number one factor when parents choose a daycare.  Since there's no way to figure out how many of those 1 million spots would be close to the parents that want a daycare its next to impossible to assess the NDP's plan.    Affordability is only 11% of the reason why parents chose that daycare according to their stats, which goes against the NDP for making daycare affordable.  But its also uncertain how accurate this stat is with all the different provincial programs like Quebec."
CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,taxrage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:34 2015 UTC,Though the chart showing most parents don't pay anything (as they make use of family/friends or fully subsidized) makes the affordability stat difficult to figure out too.

CanadaPolitics,3dyvnk,insanity_irt_reality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, its really not an easy stat to figure out as there's so many different families and arrangements.  I just don't like it when the NDP claim affordability is the biggest issue or access.    They could try and figure out optimal spots but it will never be perfect as rural and urban area's are sparse, and I tend to believe that government programs are never optimal.  Ideally they'd offer companies incentives to open daycares in house.  If companies like mine (high tech) wanted to ensure they retain employees then offering daycare would be hugely beneficial, plus I could have lunch with my kids and they could make the hours based on whats common at the company.  If someones looking at switching to a different company it would definitely weigh into the decision if the other company didn't have a daycare program."

CanadaPolitics,3dyu17,tvrr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:31 2015 UTC,T-shirts do not have collars. It's a polo/golf shirt. Huge difference between the two and the setting in which each is acceptable.
CanadaPolitics,3dyu17,CanadianJohnGalt,14,Mon Jul 20 23:29:48 2015 UTC,So your biggest issue with this is the mislabelling of the type of shirt?
CanadaPolitics,3dyu17,ProbablyStalin,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:13:43 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with him wearing partisan apparel in the least if it violates cabinet rules.

It's shoddy journalism."

Given that I'm paying $180/week for daycare for one child, the $160/month helps, but certainly doesn't offset the entire cost. I can anecdotally say that daycare access is still a problem in my part of NB. Parents routinely go on waiting lists for daycare for their future one-year old before they've even told their close friends and family that the mother is pregnant - and even that doesn't guarantee a spot. We are spending $3 billion a year to not even really fix the problem we originally meant to solve.

I guess they won't just remove their tariffs because we are. Seems like for us to get access to their market free of tariffs, we need to drop our tariffs and accept  a bunch of rules that don't benefit us on top of it.

Even voluntary association might finally make the case for energy possessing the necessary singleness for federal regulation. That would be great because a more progressive government in Ottawa could take steps to move towards renewable energy sources, probably arguing it as a matter of national concern."

I don't think so. Just because something is traded across provincial borders doesn't make the production of it a federally regulated activity. If Energy East gets approved that doesn't make the oil sands federal. Same thing with electricity production. At most the inter-provincial transmission infrastructure would become federally regulated.  If the feds want to move towards more renewable energy production they should price carbon and direct R&D resources towards solving the intermittency problem.

CanadaPolitics,3dxxgo,origamitiger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"Possibly but its not like you can separate out the electrons from a solar panel from those from a gas turbine. With transmission losses a large amount of the electricity produced will stay in province and therefore not be subject to federal regulations. Trying to regulate what sources can and can not be used to provide electricity by regulating cross border transmission seems like a rather blunt and ineffective what of doing so. Its much better to focus on what the feds can already do. Emission standards, carbon pricing and federal infrastructure spending would go a long way towards moving to a low carbon electricity grid."

Reviewing IESO website, wind and PV still only account for <10% generation for Ontario which is a drop in bucket for getting rid if dirty coal plants, and the current FIT program is transitioning away to a net-metering system anyhow... As for pricing, yes rates went up, but for the north-eastern part of this continent we're within range of our US neighbors who have NOT transitioned out of coal."

Extending the writs would mean that parliament would have to be opened for a whole new session which would mean a Throne Speech and blah, blah, blah. It would be too open in terms of optics and publicity. Also, the fixed election date legislation makes provisions for an early election but nothing for a late election. We know that constitutionally Harper could disregard the legislation but it would be easier to disregard it by calling an early election than by blowing past the set election date."

Firstly the media would skewer them non stop. Worse, the CPC base (especially in Alberta) really likes fixed election date laws (for some reason). If there's one thing about the CPC they know their base very well, it's one of the main reasons they've managed to keep power for so long. Finally, the polls right now are probably about exactly where the CPC wants them. Their only hope of forming another majority is with the Liberals polling in third. With the centrist party reduced, people may split to the left and right. On top of that, the CPC has significantly more money and a better ground organization than the NDP. The Liberals would be a bigger challenge in this regard."

Why are they not doing the same with a late call?  Is it really that much more ridiculous?"
CanadaPolitics,3dywjj,SirCharlesTupperware,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:07 2015 UTC,Is it really that much more ridiculous?   Ah I see. No I don't think it is any more ridiculous. Anyone who thought about the strategy for even a minute would have realized that an early election call was not in the CPCs favour. When a lot of that speculation was going on the Senate scandal was still pretty fresh in everyone's mind and the Liberals were polling in the 40% range to the CPC at or below 30%. Why on earth would any party risk criticism for breaking the fixed election date law under conditions like that? Certainly if the CPC was polling in the 40%+ range I could see the strategic sense in an early election but that was not the case.  Edit for another thought: There's also the possibility that the CPC fed the early election rumours to the media so that people would be prepared for it if conditions changed in their favour.

If you go late, you're in a more painfully obvious way breaking your own law because you're watching it go by and don't really have a solid narrative to explain the decision.

In the late 1950s, Nikita Khrushchev became the secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. He harshly criticized his predecessor Stalin in a speech in 1956, and then attempted to establish friendly ties with capitalist countries including the USA.   In China, Chairman Mao disagreed - he believed that Khrushchev had essentially betrayed communism by making nice with capitalist countries, and he also saw the attack on Stalin's policies as an attack on his own policies. This led to a split between the Soviet and Chinese governments, in which both claimed to be the true communists.  In Canada, most of the members of the Communist Party sided with Khrushchev and the Russians. But some members supported Mao and China in the dispute, so they left to form their own party, calling it ""Marxist-Leninist"" to emphasize that they thought they were the true followers of Marx and Lenin and the Soviets had betrayed the ideas of the founders of communism.  The two parties have remained separate ever since, although after China established ties with the USA in the mid-70s, and the fall of the Soviet Union, they are no longer aligned with the Russian and Chinese governments.

CanadaPolitics,3dywjj,amnesiajune,3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"In the US Native Americans enjoy much more autonomy than Canadian First Nations, Metis, or Inuit do.  Most (all?) Native American tribes have de-facto sovereignty on their reserves. They provide their own services, policing, and (I think) justice systems. Thus, they enjoy a self-determination that Canadian Aboriginals do not.  It's likely that this has alleviated most tensions between Native Americans and the broader American society and polity."
CanadaPolitics,3dywjj,PickerPilgrim,2,Mon Jul 20 18:08:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Are there legal obstructions to tribes in Canada obtaining de-facto sovereignty on their reserves?

CanadaPolitics,3dywjj,cold_oka,3,Mon Jul 20 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians make up a smaller percentage of the total U.S. population than Aboriginal peoples do in Canada, and these populations have a more uneven distribution (most live in western states). As such these issues rarely make the national news, but they certainly make local and state news in regions with larger indigenous populations.   If there's less talk of 'cultural genocide' it's at least in part due to there having been something much closer to violent physical genocides of many Native American populations. Much of the US was also colonized earlier than much of Canada, meaning these events are further removed from the present day.  On top of all that there may in fact be cultural differences between the US and Canada that make us more prone to examine these issues. Canada likes to think of itself as a multi-culutral society, where diverse peoples can maintain a sense of cultural identity within a larger society, whereas in the U.S. you'll more often hear talk of a 'melting-pot' where everyone becomes part of a single American identity. Additionally, the US is full of racial tensions on multiple fronts. Tensions between whites, blacks, and latinos are much more prominent than indigenous issues in much of the country. In Canada, tensions between whites and indigenous peoples are arguably our primary racial tension.   EDIT: To answer your question. If we have anything to learn from the U.S. on this issue, it wouldn't be a simple matter of taking their policies and applying it here. We really have very different situations, with different histories."

A few political analysts thought it was weird that a political leader preparing for a desperate election campaign in the fall would spend a part of July walking down the Champs-Élysée and visiting the Louvre, but I suspect going on that trip with their grandson was one of the conditions Duceppe's wife made before agreeing to let Gilles go on one last campaign.

It's Quebec's construction holiday, the most popular time to take vacation in the province, so it's unlikely that the party would have gained anything by opening up their more modest bank accounts until after the month of July. Duceppe knows that Harper first has to attend the TPP summit in July in Hawaii, which is where we'll (hopefully) see an agreement in principle. The writ will drop there after where the Tories, Bloc, NDP and Liberals will open-up on one another and really get going.

CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,EngSciGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:58:00 2015 UTC,"Except he stated 'scheme doesn't phase in for 8 years', implying there won't be any childcare for 8 years. If he had stated 'fully implemented' then yes his comment would be correct."
CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,KillerCronic,5,Mon Jul 20 17:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, it doesn't phase in until 8 years from now. It is implying that the program will be implemented in phases not completed until 8 years from the election date. He could have said fully implemented but how could he know you didn't understand what the word phases meant.   phase in, to put or come into use gradually; incorporate by degrees: to phase in new machinery.   Ex. It took 8 years for the company to phase in all the machinery they promised."
CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,EngSciGuy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:03:08 2015 UTC,You don't think you are being a bit dishonest that he phrased his statement so it appeared that the NDP plan wouldn't help people for 8 years but the Liberal plan would be immediately? A discussion can occour with out making statements that are worded in a manner to try and make you side of the argument appear better (or your opponents worse).  Trying to imply I don't understand a word is starting to get a bit unnecessarily insulting.
CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,KillerCronic,4,Mon Jul 20 17:09:39 2015 UTC,"The Liberal plan is immediate. The NDP plan is not. There will be 2/3rd of families that don't see anything in the first year while the Liberal plan helps 100% of people immediately.   I think your issue is that you want the NDP to get full credit right away, despite their plan not being fully implemented for 8 years."

My concern is statements be made accurately otherwise no constructive discussion can be made.   They cost roughly the same ($4 (Liberal) vs. $5 billion (NDP)).   Average day care costs (ontario-toddler) is ~$11,000  Liberal Plan - https://www.liberal.ca/files/2015/05/Fairness-for-the-Middle-Class.pdf  NDP Plan - http://www.ndp.ca/sites/default/files/news/141014-childcare-mediabackgrounder-en_ottawa.pdf  Now the question is does the NDP plan get rid of UCCB? If not then it would seem it is of greater benefit.   The Liberal plan increases funding to the lowest income bracket by $1,128 a year.  The NDP plan cuts day care costs in half. If UCCB remains what it is, the total cost is covered. The Liberal plan still leaves ~$4k per child to be covered. Now if the NDP plan removes UCCB then that leaves ~$5.5k to be covered."
CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,LastBestWest,0,Mon Jul 20 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Now the question is does the NDP plan get rid of UCCB?   No. I'm not sure if it rolls back Harper's enhancement, but I know it doesn't scrabble the original payment."
CanadaPolitics,3dwgvr,EngSciGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 19:59:16 2015 UTC,"What I meant by ""phase in"" was phase in. I was specifically comparing the phase in of the NDP day care program, to the phase in of the Conservative infrastructure program. In both cases, they start very small in the near term, and grow to something substantial in time for the next government to pay for it.  I was also contrasting it with the Liberal child benefit, which provides a large, tax free transfer, to the families that need it most, right away."

I find this approach doesn't actually benefit conversation, such as below I have done so but flipped who gets the positive light on it;  ""The Liberals are promising a small bump to the UCCB which still leaves even the poorest parent on the hook for ~$4k a year in day care costs. The NDP plan will result in that parent not having to pay anything for daycare.""  Nothing I said was inaccurate, but by omitting certain components I easily put your argument on its head. Now these numbers are accurate, but as you said the number of positions available is small for 2015/6 (60,000) and increases each year ( 2018/9 - 360,000, 2023/4 - 1M)."

The NDP claim they will have 60,000 spaces in the first year, 123,000 in the second year, and 370,000 (of a planned 1,000,000) by the end of their first mandate. This is assuming the provinces come on board for their share of the costs, which is no certain thing.   because they are less ambitious.   I think providing low and middle income families with up to $6200 per year per child, tax free, is pretty ambitious. It has been described as ""mincome for children"" and will lift 300,000 children out of poverty immediately.   I am not opposed to universal daycare, as long as it is fully costed, fully funded, and universal (though I think higher income families should bear more of the cost).

The media says they won't raise PIT based on Mulcair's past comments, but their approach on this may well change given the Liberals are now proposing a PIT hike (though, their's is revenue neutral because they're cutting taxes for the upper-middle class/somewhat rich as much as they are hiking them for the rich).

The Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes in 2014 was $0.52575 per 5 cigarettes or fraction thereof, an increase of $0.10075 per 5 cigarettes or fraction thereof. The measure was anticipated to bring an additional $685 million in tax revenue.  In 2013 there were 31.477 million units of cigarettes sold in Canada. At the new tax rate this would be a minimum of $3.3 billion dollars in federal revenue (assuming those units were sold in packs divisible by 5 - any other division results in even higher tax).  Legalizing marijuana sale and applying a similar excise tax to marijuana would increase the Federal coffers, although by how much is questionable. 39.4% of surveyed persons 15 and older admitted to using marijuana at some point in their life in a 2011 Health Canada survey and 9.1% said they had used it in the past year.

After eight years, the federal share would reach $5-billion annually. That is based on a per-capita funding formula in which the federal government pays 60 per cent of the cost of new affordable spots created, the NDP said.   That $1.8 billion price tag is only for the first few years, when the program will only accommodate one of every 6 kids under the age of five.

CanadaPolitics,3dv1vi,Mr_Stay_Puft,15,Mon Jul 20 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"""Families have supported the Conservative party because the Conservative government has supported families,"" Poilievre said.   Poilievre's comment is exactly why I'm always wary of drawing ""they're just pandering!"" conclusions. If people vote for a party because they will do X, and then the party gets elected and does X, is it really surprising that the party's supporters end up as the biggest beneficiaries? That was why they voted for the party in the first place...  There's also the simple ""coincidence"" angle to consider, as /u/Gears_and_Beers brought up. What if any child care benefit increase necessarily would have to disproportionately benefit CPC ridings, simply because that's where all the kids are? In that scenario, even if this was a perfect policy decision, it would be decried as CPC pandering.  tl;dr the political grandstanding surrounding these benefits is very likely blatant campaigning/pandering, but the benefits themselves might well be legitimate."

If Harper drops the writ early, he'll be accused of doing so to increase the spending limit, which supposedly would benefit the Conservatives because they have more donations, and can therefore afford higher spending limits.  The truth, however, is all the parties have enough money on hand to spend the limit on a 60 day campaign, or longer.  If they don't, they can easily get bank loans because all election spending is reimbursed by taxpayers.  If Harper drops the writ as late as possible, he'll be accused of doing so to delay limits on third-party and government advertising.  It will be argued this somehow benefits the CPC more than the other parties.  The truth, however, is that most of the third parties are anti-Harper PACs, and cynical government advertising so close to the writ would most likely have the opposite effect.  Basically whenever the writ is dropped, the PM will be accused of manipulating the schedule.  It has always been so."

The fact that aboriginal groups are recognized as sovereign entities is rooted in the fact that the Crown entered into agreements directly with those people. The very nature of treaties in Canada recognizes the distinction of aboriginal groups from the Crown and as nations.

This drew attacks from fellow Liberals, who long opposed recognizing Quebec as a nation in the constitution.  The Bloc Québécois saw blood in the water, so they tabled a motion in the House that would recognize Quebeckers as a nation.  Nobody expected the Bloc motion to pass, but the day before the vote, PM Harper tabled a government motion that would ""recognize that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada"".

They had to come up with an attack that would stick, and hit with it early. If the ""not a leader"" thing hadn't flown on Dion, they would have been in some serious trouble. It did work, because Dion doesn't come across as an engaging speaker with interesting ideas.  The ironic thing is that when you see Dion speak without a speech in front of him, just going on points or from memory, he's far better. Smart, engaged, interestic.

CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,seemedlikeagoodplan,34,Mon Jul 20 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"""Second, Harper actually fears Trudeau more than he does Mulcair, despite what the polls are saying now.""   This isn't how the PCs come off to me at all.   The biggest issue the NDP face today is brand recognition, so much so that ignoring them is the wisest thing the PCs can do as of now.  Dodge the NDP in debates, dismiss them when you can, but never actively address the NDP position. Pull out of debates, and limit as much PC on NDP exposure as possible. Try to make it look like a two party race. Scoff and wave.  To allow Mulcair a voice, to shine any light on him, is only going to help the NDP. Right now a fair amount of Canadians still see the NPD as some wacky socialist-movement, and Angry Mulcair as some impotent stand-in for Layton, and that's if Canadians can even identify Mulcair. If Canadians actually get a look at the NPD and Mulcair they might win a majority government by the end of this election.  Limit NPD exposure, control the conversation, hope the left splits, and focus on the Liberals --this is all the PCs have. To play up the inexperience of the NDP or to try and reinforce the socialist stereotype will just give the NDP room to speak in their defense.   If Mulcair wins a major debate I would not be surprised to see an NDP majority. The NDP's biggest concern should be the debates, and how to focus an attack with the hoards of ammunition the PCs have provided. After all these years of a PC government it'll be a miracle if the NDP don't trip up in it all."
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,Akosce,32,Sun Jul 19 12:22:43 2015 UTC,Everyone on Reddit seems to think that it has to do with not wanting to recognize or legitimize the NDP but it's really much simpler than that.  Take a look here and you can see that from the 2011 election to the current polls now that the liberals and conservatives typically account for a combined 53-58% of the vote.  The NDP are actually slightly higher than they were in 2011 and that's likely at the expense of the Greens and the Bloc.  If we attack the NDP those votes are far more likely to flood to the Liberals than they would our way.  If we attack the Liberals those votes are far more likely to flood our way.  You can see an illustration of that here where you can see that 19% of cons are likely to vote Liberals as their second choice and 11% of liberals are likely to vote conservative as their second choice.  Simple as that really.

He bet the farm and lost it. Harper has done the exact same thing. These ads need time and the CPC made them before the NDP got their surge and likely before the APC's got booted.  I agree that Trudeau should be attacking Mulcair more so than the CPC but the Liberals are a third place party right now and are struggling to remain relevant. Aside from hardcore Liberals on the east coast, Liberals are sucking wind federally. Latest polls show the NDP will win a minority which happened in AB before they got their majority.  There's no guarantee of course. The NDP could lose. The Liberals could win a majority. The CPC could maintain their lead.

Liberal voters, in my experience, have more in common politically with the NDP than they do with the Conservatives. If the Conservatives manage to destroy Trudeau's campaign with their carpet bombing level of advertising, I doubt they'll get too many Liberal voters in return who agree with a lot of what Trudeau has to say. If traditional liberals lose hope in Trudeau they may flock to the polls to support the NDP if only to unseat Harper. There's still a long campaign ahead of us though!"

CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,Dan4t,5,Sun Jul 19 17:44:07 2015 UTC,I think that beating these ads over the public's collective head like this is turning into a game of diminishing returns. The vast majority of people have seen them at least a few times by now. Do they expect the polls to respond even further if they keep airing these ads? I think the returns on these has plateaued.
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,GayPerry_86,5,Sun Jul 19 23:11:26 2015 UTC,"It's called the variation-repetition hypothesis, and is well recognized in all forms of advertising. Repeating a simple message over and over works on a subconscious level to create a gut feeling of truth. The NDP and Liberals use it too, but though different avenues. Like the not caring about science or the environment stuff had little effect initially, but now it is assumed to be true. And the Trudeau ""just not ready"" messaging could arguably have been a factor that even influenced Liberals to being more prone to joining the NDP as soon as something controversial happened to give them an excuse."
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,Dan4t,2,Sun Jul 19 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"Right, but don't people start tuning out repetitive messages? My argument is that returns are diminished. Surely this has basis in fact, or we would still be getting advertisements from the 50s"
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,GayPerry_86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"Right, but don't people start tuning out repetitive messages?   That's the entire point of the tactic. It only works when you're not paying attention. As a bonus, anyone with a bias against the information will eventually let down their defenses. The reason the repetitive messages are simple is so that your mind can comprehend it while not paying attention.    My argument is that returns are diminished.   It's the opposite, returns increase over time. Businesses like  Coca-Cola wouldn't be spending billions on their ads if this wasn't the case.   To understand it you have to look into how memories are formed. When your brain develops a new memory, it records it within the context of the other thoughts that were in your mind at the time.  If you are thinking about something different during each new exposure to the ad, then the message becomes associated with the context of each new thought. To look back at the Coca-Cola example, this is why it is so important for them to advertise in so many different places. The more thoughts the message becomes associated with, the more broad of an influence it will have over your perception. If you instead paid full attention to the ad each time, then it doesn't get associated with other thoughts to the same extent. This is the variation side of the repetition-variation hypothesis. When ads are made to be interesting, they typically have nothing to do with the product. The goal is only to associate new thoughts to the same message/brand.   In the case of Trudeau, eventually it will lead to paying more attention to things he says which fit the theme of being ""in over his head."" So it compounds over time, not just from exposure to the ads them selves, but exposure to anything about Trudeau. When it impacts your judgement of speeches by Trudeau, you won't recall the idea as having come from a CPC ad.    Surely this has basis in fact, or we would still be getting advertisements from the 50s   Not sure what you are getting at here."
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,Dan4t,2,Sun Jul 19 19:04:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, it's fairly straight forward. If the effectiveness of advertising increased over exposure time linearly, without any asymptotic diminished return, then why do ads need to ever change if the product remains the same?"
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,GayPerry_86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:55:38 2015 UTC,"Oh okay I think I maybe see what you were getting at before. Yea, obviously some attention is needed, hence the variation in ads. But the message doesn't need to change. I mean the ""in over his head"" message can be associated with a ton of different things he has said. And multiple advertizing strategies can be used concurrently."
CanadaPolitics,3dt41o,Dan4t,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"I found some sources for you that directly counter your argument:  ""A recognized drawback of using repeated advertising is a negative effect on consumers termed ""wearout"" (Craig, Sternthal and Leavitt, 1976). A number of studies attempting to discover the impact of repeated messages have found a tedium reaction as people tire of being exposed to the same message over and over again. Several of these studies have noted the emergence of a curvilinear effect, whereby an initial positive effect resulting from a moderate number of exposures is followed by a negative reaction as the number of exposures is increased (Appel, 1971; Cacioppo & Petty, 1979; Calder & Sternthal, 1980; Gorn & Goldberg, 1980; Grass & Wallace, 1969; Winter, 1973). For example, while testing the effects of cogent messages that advocated a position either consistent with or contrary to the attitude initially held by the subject, Cacioppo and Petty (1979) found an increase in agreement with an attitudinal position in the one and three exposure conditions, but by five exposures a decreasing trend became apparent.  Such curvilinear effects have also been found to occur in situations of repeated advertising. Under laboratory conditions, Calder and Sternthal (1980) were able to show that a moderate amount of exposures led to a slight increase in product i evaluation, while increasing the repetition of exposures led to a dramatic decrease. In a more natural setting in which children were exposed to an ice-cream advertisement in the context of a cartoon program, Gorn and Goldberg reported that children voiced a greater preference for the product after receiving three ad exposures (moderate exposure) compared to children receiving either one or five exposures."""

The NDP are pretty much broke. They're message is going to get pretty drowned out when the writ drops. The CPC has a huge amount of money to spend and the Liberals also have a decent amount.

CanadaPolitics,3ds4ug,pjl1701,6,Sun Jul 19 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"parental leave   Are we talking about unpaid ""I'm going away for a bit but I want to come back to my job"" leave?  I absolutely agree with that (subject to reasonable caveats, of course; if the employer's circumstances are such that they would have laid you off during the period when you were gone, it's absurd to say that you should return to do a job which no longer exists).  If you're talking about ""I'm not going to be working, so the government should pay me instead"" leave, I'm a bit more wary; our EI system discriminates against young workers who have trouble accumulating enough hours to qualify, for example.  I'd rather see this rolled together with other forms of not-working benefits rather than having a specific program to pay new parents.  If you're talking about ""I'm not going to be working, but my employer should keep paying me"" leave... absolutely not.  Companies may choose to offer this as a benefit, but requiring it from all employers creates a strong incentive for covert discrimination against people who are likely to become parents.   child care   Absolutely not.  To start with, government-funded childcare programs privilege some family structures over others -- parents who outsource child-rearing get the benefit, but parents who care for their own children (either individually, or as communities of parents who look after each other's kids) don't get anything.  Second, government child-care programs inevitably discriminate against the people who need the subsidy the most -- workers in low-paying jobs with unpredictable hours.  But most importantly, as Palpz says, having children is (usually) something people choose to do because they think it will be rewarding; and from everything I've heard, they're right.  But there are people -- I know several -- who would love to have kids but are unable to do so... and it seems the height of unreasonableness to ask them to pay for everybody else's kids."

Suppose everyone who didn't have children paid less in taxes and that the lost revenue was only taken out of the education system. That generation of kids will be driving the economy in a couple of decades. So while those childless retirees were potentially able to accrue more in savings, they're living in an economy that arguably isn't thriving as much as it could have been.   Similarly, affordable child care alleviates some stress and financial burdens from parents.

I have the same issue with ""universal"" child care that other's have expressed here. As a shift worker my child care needs do not fit into a 9 - 5 existence. Nor do I need child care 5 days a week. So to be subsidizing someone else while not getting the benefit would be grating.  If we are going to be providing subsidies then why not a direct monthly amount, and let parents decide what works best. For some, that could even mean staying home. (eg assume $500 a month by 3 kids = 18,000 = may not be worth the hassle to work, particularly low paying or part time jobs).  Get rid of income splitting and in the case of single or divorced parents direct the whole payment to the spouse with custody or split (as it is done now with CCTB) where joint custody exists.

CanadaPolitics,3ds4ug,ehImCanadian,5,Sun Jul 19 02:07:52 2015 UTC,"Previous work by the University of British Columbia estimates that B.C.’s program would cost $1.5 billion per year. The CCPA calculates that if the federal government does not help fund the program, the B.C. government would have to pay $202 million per year after realizing $630 million a year from increased taxes, economic growth and reduced use of government benefits.  Meanwhile, the federal government would see increased revenues of $688 million a year.   Unfortunately, they don't break that number down further as far as I can tell. Here is the full paper if you really want to know."

Just check into which Quebec families have to go on waiting lists for those $7/day spaces.  Finally, it's extremely expensive, worth about $40K/child up to the age of 4.

But it really isn't the point to stick on. Getting back to availability...  There is no one system that will fit all. But, sadly, there are enough voters in the 70% to make it palatable to skip over the other 30%.  Personally, if the desire is there to subsidize everyone's daycare, I would give everyone cash and tell them to figure it out as best suits their needs. Taxable of course to bring some income adjustment to the process. Those on the bottom don't pay taxes and would receive the money tax free, those on the top would pay the higher taxes and have their money taxed back.

Some families have close access to schools and medical services, while some families have to drive long distances, or have no car that would allow them to reach a school or hospital in a short amount of time.  The same applies to public transit services: those living close to transit stops will have much better access to it than those living further away, or those who travel at hours when the buses have stopped running.  There's no way (to my knowledge) of providing most public services such that they are equally available or beneficial to everyone.  But that needn't be a precondition to providing them, and doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile.

If I borrow money from private banks, there is interest and these terms to do not exist.

Garneau's Twitter feed seems a lot worse than most MPs. For example, he is still saying that Mulcair has changed his position on Energy East, even after it was revealed that he was misquoted. Maybe I think he's more partisan because he seems to attack the NDP more than he does the Conservatives. Although, that alone would be an indication of his ideological orientation."
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,LastBestWest,5,Sat Jul 18 22:20:11 2015 UTC,Not sure why Garneau has this cross-partisan appeal.   ...   He's also blue Liberal and probably one of the most right-wing members of the Liberal caucus.   ?
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,Gmanacus,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Regarding his appeal, I'm mostly talking about ITT. I don't have any evidence is like any more by supporters of other parties than any other Liberal MP.  I based my impression of his ideology mainly on his leadership campaign (more right-wing policies than most and the fact that he was supported by conservative Liberals like McKay) and his comments in the House. On foreign policy, for example, he seems to be a hawk. He was supportive of Harper's intervention in Iraq and critical of the NDP's position until the Liberal Party backflipped on the mission."
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,LastBestWest,5,Sat Jul 18 22:15:15 2015 UTC,"Good points.  I figure the right likes him 'cause he leans right, the Liberals like him 'cause he is a liberal, and the left likes him 'cause he is an astronaut.  Well, that and 'cause he holds many left values.

CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,Gmanacus,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"He also just generally comes across as an adult, which is a surprisingly rare quality in Parliament. Measured tone of voice, never hysterical or off the cuff, and a good, deep set of life experiences to draw upon."

Even coming in 3rd with 90 seats is still a crap ton better, and shows liberal support is actually growing. It would be the first election since chretien that the liberals didnt lose seats. I know the NDP is polling higher overall, but I'm not convinced that a riding-by-riding breakdown of votes would show that they're going to just sweep an area like montreal."

CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,c_kruze,3,Sat Jul 18 16:35:24 2015 UTC,Anyone on the ground in that neighbourhood (for either party) care to share your opinion on the NDG-Westmount race?
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,BattlestarBattaglia,4,Sat Jul 18 16:23:34 2015 UTC,"This is my riding actually. The old ridings which were combined were Westmount-Ville Marie where Garneau barely kept his seat in 2011 and NDG Lachine Dorval where Isabelle Morin won a seat for the NDP in 2011 in what had been a long standing Liberal riding.   Westmount is generally considered a higher income neighborhood and Ville Marie is a diverse mix of student housing, luxury condos and low income housing in some corners. NDG's vote was pretty evenly split last time around between the NDP and the Liberals (Lachine and Dorval were more Orange leaning). NDG is a middle class neighborhood with a diversity of residents along varying linguistic, fiscal and ethnic lines.    Sue Montgomery is relatively well known in the riding as a former Gazette reporter (especially known for her reporting following the earthquake in Haiti). Peter McQueen is probably more well known, as a municipal councilor. He's recognizable riding around the neighborhood on his bike always stopping to speak to residents. A third interesting candidate is the former head of Brewery Mission. His name escapes me at the moment unfortunately. I think McQueen will the nomination. He's been very active signing up party members in the riding.   Any candidate will have a tough up hill battle against the incumbent Garneau. The riding has a deep history of voting Liberal and has a significant Anglo proportion of voters (important cause Anglo voters in QC have been reluctant to vote for anybody other than the Liberals since Mulroney fell and the Bloc rose in '93).   It's certainly an opportunity for a seat gain for the NDP, however, I was disappointed with the candidates running. Garneau has a lot of star power..."
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,LastBestWest,3,Sat Jul 18 23:16:57 2015 UTC,"To me, this just sounds like Mulcair spinning his wheels as he's noticing the Bloc picking up steam. At this point, virtually all Bloc gains will be coming from NDP-held seats, so Tom's time might be better served consolidating the gains his party made in 2011 rather than overextending his party's efforts in a contest against a popular constituency MP with national name recognition.  To draw a parallel, this is like John McCain campaigning in Pennsylvania in the last days of the 2008 US Presidential election, despite traditionally red states like Indiana and North Carolina in jeopardy (Obama won all three)."
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,trailerparkfan,3,Sat Jul 18 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's one interpretation, though not one that is supported by evidence. The Bloc immediately gained about 10 points after Duceppe came back and all of it was at the expense of the Liberals and Conservatives. Sure, it's possible, even likely, that they did take from the NDP and the NDP just took more from the Liberals and Conservatives. Maybe, Mulcair is trying to position the NDP as the DE facto federalist option for Quebecers as the Bloc has now moved into second-place in most polls.  A more simple, more likely, and better supported theory is that Mulcair is saying this simply because the Liberals have collapsed in Quebec and there are several star candidates vying for the NDP nomination in Garneau's new riding."
CanadaPolitics,3dqwpt,bunglejerry,3,Sun Jul 19 00:30:51 2015 UTC,EKOS has Mulcair at almost 40% in Quebec I don't think he is scared he is right where he needs to be.

CanadaPolitics,3dplb3,d-boom,5,Sat Jul 18 05:33:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with Andrew Coyne's take on this. I've read the full National Energy Strategy and found that the language was so convoluted that it was really hard to ascertain what the plans are, concretely, in most spots. In fact, it read by and large like 50 pages of motherhood statements and descriptions of what's happening today.   On the climate change/environmental protection front, there are lovely sounding statements about the need to develop resources in a manner that protects the environment and reduces our carbon footprint and GHG emissions. Not much in the way of meat to sink one's teeth into on how this would be achieved, though. Lots of plans to gather and share data and information. Great to gather and share data to track progress; it's not by gathering and sharing information that you're going to achieve anything in the real world, though.   Here's a link to the CBC article which includes a link to the full document at the bottom.   http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/politics/national-energy-strategy-ok-d-at-meeting-of-premiers-1.3157487  The passages in the document that speak to environmental protection are almost laughable in light of reports of yet another pipeline leak this week.  I've copied a few examples of these passages in, below.  Page 11:   Develop and enhance a modern, reliable, environmentally safe and efficient series of transmission and transportation networks for domestic and export/import sources of energy.  Improve the timeliness and certainty of regulatory approval decision-making processes while maintaining rigorous protection of the environment and public interest.   Page 13:   Maintain the highest degree of environmental safeguards and protection, including by addressing climate change, climate resilience and reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally.    On this week's pipeline leak, here's a link to one of a number of articles written about it:  http://globalnews.ca/news/2117570/alberta-oil-spill-when-failsafe-leak-detection-systems-fail/  While still early days, it's being reported as the worst spill in Alberta, thus far, and has the company that owns the pipeline scratching its head over how the spill could have happened and gone undetected for as long as it did. The pipeline is only one year old and was apparently outfitted with state of the art spill detection technology.  Hmmm ... Hard to believe that the environment will be better protected as the number of pipelines and distances they cover increase.   I've been sceptical for some time now that we can both increase bitumen extraction activity/streamline delivery methods and at the same time reduce our GHG emissions. Having read the National Energy Strategy, I'm not feeling any more confident that we can, in fact, have it all ... as the Premiers would have us believe.   It's a simple law of nature that increased activity leads to increased outputs. Canada has already acknowledged that it won't meet its 2020 emissions reductions targets; to step up extraction activity while at the same time soberly expressing commitment to reducing emissions, smacks of kicking the problem down the road.  The next link in this post goes to a report by the CBC which describes findings in a 2013 Environment Canada report that looked at a particular type of oilsands development (using in-situ technology).  In brief, the report projected that, by 2020, ""this type of oilsands development will be generating more greenhouse gas emissions than all of the Maritime provinces put together today.""  The article also states that 80 per cent of known oilsands deposits are so deep that they are only accessible with in-situ technology. It also describes the damage done by another pipeline leak and speaks to the implications of environmental assessment changes made at the federal level a few years ago.   http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/technology/new-environmental-review-rules-anger-oilsands-critics-1.2252074  I agree with Andrew Coyne's quip about the lack of federal leadership and would add that the gutting of environmental protection laws by the Feds a few years ago is most concerning, given the restrictions in terms of what provinces can look at in keeping with the powers bestowed on them in the Constitution.   I like Mulcair's position on pipelines. I sincerely hope that the NDP will be elected this fall and that they will make good on their promises to repair the damage that the current government has done to our national environmental protection and assessment laws.  Somebody needs to be looking out for the greater good of the country in a manner that balances short term economic desires with environmental imperatives.  It's been clear for some time that we can't rely of the current government to do this. Sadly, I don't think we can rely on individual premiers to do it, either."

The country has embarked on the most ambitious energy revolution anywhere in the industrialized world. Last year, 26 per cent of Germany’s power supply came from renewable sources. By 2050, the figure is targeted to rise to 80 per cent. The shift, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said last month, is Germany’s “man on the moon” project.

Forum has the Libs tied for second with the CPC at 27%; this poll shows continued softening of LPC support, but they still have support of ~1/4 of Canadians. If the Liberals were to do worse than last time you could maybe make the argument that the party will have to do some real soul searching on its future.

Guess what guys? We spent 44 years under a Conservative administration that largely followed Brad Wall's tactic of demanding to know why the fuck anyone other than the originating province should have a say in pipelines, regardless of which jurisdictions they cross. Did it work? Well let's see: Northern Gateway was proposed in 2006, Keystone XL in 2008, the Trans Mountain expansion in 2013, Energy East in 2013.  Four proposals spanning a decade and ground hasn't been broken on a single one. I'm sorry but everything the PCs tried failed utterly, and I think it's high time we switched tactics. I'm willing to give Notley's approach a chance - I'm not saying it's going to work, but it sure as hell can't fail any harder than the old way of doing things."
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,Diffog,22,Fri Jul 17 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. Wall has already sold the pipeline to Saskatchewan, and the PCs sold it to Alberta. Now Alberta and Saskatchewan, for better or worse, need to sell it to the public in Ontario and Quebec. Yelling at them is not going to do anything."
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,drhuge12,5,Fri Jul 17 22:45:43 2015 UTC,Plenty were built the old way though. The problem is that once we allow one province to extract demands from us in a single deal it will need to be a part of every deal going forward.
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,jamiesg,8,Sat Jul 18 01:18:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, but times have changed. First Nations have a voice, environmental concerns are mainstream, and we've almost certainly hit the point of peak oil consumption in Canada and the US (and we hit it long ago in Europe).  It's entirely possible that these will be some of the last oil pipelines built in Canada. Obviously nobody can predict the future and there's lots of disagreement even among experts, but I wouldn't be surprised if global oil demand peaked in a couple of decades or so. Combine all that with ever-improving fracking technology creating ever-higher levels of viable oil supply and I think this may be Alberta's last shot at making a serious buck off its natural resources.  I don't claim to have a crystal ball and nothing's ever certain, but personally I'd rather we err on the side of caution and see new pipelines constructed now, and bugger the precedents set."
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,Diffog,2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"What about the vast amount so pipelines that did work?   Interprovincial (and it's extensions) , trans mountain, all of pembina pipelines, all of trans Canada pipelines, foothills pipeline, express pipeline, alliance pipeline, Mackenzie valley pipeline, and the keystone. And not to mention the endless amount of pipelines in northern AB and BC.   I think we are in much better shape, pipeline wise, then you give us credit for."
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,SexualPredat0r,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"That's fair, you're right that it's not as if we're completely high and dry for oil transport. But AFAIK (and I'm certainly not an expert) we are missing out on export and expansion opportunities by not getting more pipelines up and running. New pipelines would also reduce the amount of oil moving by rail, which in increasing year-by-year and which carries a much higher environmental spill risk-per-barrel.  What I was trying to get at in my original post is that I think a more competent administration might have succeeded in negotiating paths for the Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain if they'd approached from a more conciliatory and consensus perspective. I also very much doubt the PCs would ever have made Energy East a reality (not saying the NDP are guaranteed to either).  Again, I'm just a layperson but when I look back the PC track record of oil sands management over the last two decades the word ""success"" does not come to mind."
CanadaPolitics,3dnrng,Diffog,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"Well I think that more pipelines are good, as rail. Has become too dangerous. But I personally don't think we need to be shipping oil to the US at a discounted price. I'm not too upset keystone xl didn't go through. And I'm a little bit undecided about energy east. Yeah, sure it would be great to have it refined in Canada (no, we do not need more refineries!), but I think we should be shipping it out west to sell it."

The western premiers used to meet beforehand to work out positions on various issues. They once drove Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau half-mad with their Four Amigos routine.  Alberta PC Premier Peter Lougheed and his Saskatchewan counterpart, New Democrat Allan Blakeney, were the intellectual leaders who patrolled a formidable western front.  We’re a long way from that now. Down east, there will be a chuckle or two in the Ontario and Quebec delegations.   Indeed. It's also very strange to see a Western Premier argue in favour of Ottawa having more jurisdiction over energy issues."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,sesoyez,17,Fri Jul 17 18:03:51 2015 UTC,That's a funny way to describe a steady increase in the amount of health care funding provided.

CanadaPolitics,3dne26,krasnyoktyabr,12,Fri Jul 17 18:30:08 2015 UTC,Yup; apparently this is Mr. Harper's health care cuts.
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Palpz,4,Fri Jul 17 18:45:02 2015 UTC,I can't see from any of the links if inflation is accounted for in these numbers or not.  Also would need to account for;   population growth GDP growth   So if you don't normalize against all those you aren't getting any useful information.
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,EngSciGuy,5,Fri Jul 17 19:47:13 2015 UTC,"Even if you normalize for population growth and GDP growth, the 6% annual increases in healthcare transfers from the Federal government massively exceed that."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,AlanYx,2,Fri Jul 17 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"What the argument might be coming from is related to the PBO report darkretributor linked to;  http://www.parl.gc.ca/PBO-DPB/documents/Renewing_CHT.pdf  Basically the average cost of healthcare is going up at a rate greater than the amount the feds are transferring. The provinces are having to cover this extra amount leading to the provinces running deficits but the feds getting a surplus. If the cost was spread out more evenly the PBO claims both sides could be financially balanced.  So ya calling it a cut isn't appropriate, more a case of not 'covering their share'? Though that comes down somewhat to political ideologies.  Also worth noting it was only 6% for the first bit. It is 3% or inflation, which ever is higher."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,EngSciGuy,4,Fri Jul 17 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"The Feds can't control the cost of delivering healthcare, because healthcare is a provincial responsibility under the constitution. There's no way any Federal government, regardless of political stripes, is going to step up and agree to fund whatever increase in costs the provinces happen to create. It's up to the provinces to constrain costs to some function of GDP, population growth, and aging. The Federal government has been more than generous on that score.  The problem with healthcare costs is that the provinces have totally failed to contain compensation costs for doctors, nurses, and administrators. Money going to actual care is being starved. That's got nothing to do with the federal government."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,AlanYx,3,Fri Jul 17 23:06:02 2015 UTC,"Actually a large part of the cost increase is due to the aging population. It costs a lot of money to keep people alive for that end 10 years of their life which they wouldn't be enjoying with out modern medicine. Compensation might play a role, but it is small compared to the other drivers of cost.  The federal transfer amount doesn't seem to account for the aging population given the PBO expects Federal transfers will accounts for only 10% of health funding in 25 years.  The Federal government hasn't been generous, it isn't like donating to charity. It is their job to make sure the country operates properly."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,EngSciGuy,11,Sat Jul 18 02:33:04 2015 UTC,Why the heck would you need to account for GDP growth?
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Palpz,3,Fri Jul 17 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"Why the heck would you need to account for GDP growth?    Because the marginal productivity of healthcare is itself related to GDP.  If I receive a medical treatment that gives me a day's extra productivity (net of not having the treatment and recovering naturally, no need to be morbid), then society has gained that GDP.  If I am completely average in every way, then that intervention gains society one day's worth of per-capita GDP.  That suggests that the socially-optimum level of medical spending is indeed as a fraction of GDP, limited by the cost of the most marginal treatment versus the quality-of-life gains.  Now, in Canada we have decided that the vast majority of (hospital) medical care should be publicly funded.  This does not change the optimum level of spending (since I'd be willing to pay out-of-pocket to receive those wage gains from productivity), but it does affect how we split the bill.  If federal transfers have not kept up as a share of GDP, that suggests that the federal government is either downloading more costs to the provinces over time or intends that the public payment model of health care should be weakened."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Majromax,11,Fri Jul 17 20:08:15 2015 UTC,I am not sure that the unstated assumption that the goal of the public health care system is primarily to boost the GDP  is all that valid.
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Palpz,5,Fri Jul 17 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"""Boosting GDP"" is at minimum what the health care system should do (public or private), since not even doing that is wasteful and inefficient.  Beyond that, we also have non-economic functions of health care, but health care->GDP is a floor.  We have a public health care system because we find social value in risk-sharing, and because a fully private health care system has serious market inefficiencies.  This should not have much effect on the raw size of the medical sector, and evidence from other countries is mixed (where nations with private-sector involvement have lower health care spending, but the US with much more has significantly greater spending.)"
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Majromax,9,Fri Jul 17 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"""Boosting GDP"" is at minimum what the health care system should do (public or private), since not even doing that is wasteful and inefficient.    It is certainly an expected side effect of it, but it should never be considered the goal of the program. We do, after all, still spend health care dollars on retirees, etc, folks who spending health care dollars on doesn't help get them back to work and being productive little citizens.   So anyways, I question the rationale for adjusting health care spending on the basis of GDP, since I still don't see how our health care needs increase upon the basis of GDP. The point, after all, is to allocate dollars where it does the most good for people's health and well being, not to allocate dollars where they will have the highest impact upon our productivity. The fact that it will generally tend to do the latter doesn't make it the target."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Palpz,8,Fri Jul 17 21:45:35 2015 UTC,"Inflation may not be accounted for in that number, but the increases in health care funding are guaranteed in the Conservative's funding formula to never fall below the rate of inflation.  It's set to an annual x% rise in funding or a rise equal to the rate of inflation, whichever is higher.  And there's simply no way that you can call that a ""cut"".  Anyone saying that the Conservatives are cutting health care funding is either ignorant or lying.  There is no other option.  You can argue that the increases are insufficient given societal changes, (an aging population is something I'd consider more relevant than population growth), but any claim that an increase is a cut is simply false.  Which means a mistake or a lie."
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Issachar,7,Fri Jul 17 20:23:08 2015 UTC,But not also population growth? That is interesting. Well glad they at least locked it to inflation.  Well you can call it a 'cut' if it isn't keeping up with inflation and arguably with population. Now by the same argument you can't call it an increase if it is just keeping up with those. Granted it all comes down to semantics and the term used doesn't matter so much as what the end result is.
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,EngSciGuy,4,Fri Jul 17 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure transfer payment increases will be tied to the rate of GDP growth, which captures both population growth and net increases in productivity.    (Yeah the policy is to increase the CHT annually using a three year moving average of nominal GDP growth, with a floor of 3%)"

CanadaPolitics,3dne26,darkretributor,3,Fri Jul 17 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Cheers.  Edit: Oh interesting, so the 'complaint' is that the cost of healthcare is outpacing the amount that the transfer amount is increasing by.   It seems the result of the report is that as the cost has to get more heavily picked up by the provinces they will suffer growing debt, while the federal government is able to generate a surplus, but if the costs were balanced out better both provincial and federal would be fiscally sustainable."

(It might have come up because some provinces had increasing populations and others had stable or shrinking ones.)  I don't know.  But I remember this bit about the increase never being below the rate of inflation because this falsehood about ""cuts"" keeps coming up and I keep getting reminded that it's simply not true.  And at this point, I'm having trouble believing that the so many people who should know how it works have simply not bothered to look it up or don't understand what the word ""cut"" means.  Edit: If I recall correctly, (and I might not) it was set to 6% increases for a number of years and set to go to 3% or inflation whichever is higher after a while and that's where we are now."

Let me help: beginning in 2017, health transfer increases will be tied to economic growth, which obviously will never even come close to the 6% transfers that have been the standard for the past decade.

CanadaPolitics,3dne26,Palpz,0,Sat Jul 18 17:19:23 2015 UTC,I think you're being a bit too definitive with that word. The BoC cut its rate from 0.75 to 0.5 just recently. That could also be described as a reduction in rate.  The feds were previously giving 6%. Now they plan to give much less. Health care costs are expected to rise by 5.1% annually. Their decision to give less amounts to a cut in my books.
CanadaPolitics,3dne26,insanity_irt_reality,3,Sat Jul 18 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"They cut the rate itself. The thing that we're actually talking about is the interest rate.

But this story is important in how it shows that the courts do refrain from excising judicial intervention.

No, that's why an injunction was asked for.  If the judge had time to have a full hearing on the merits of the legislation prior to the election, no injunction would be necessary -- we'd be discussing a final verdict.  The analysis here is largely right.  Courts are generally extremely reluctant to apply an injunction against newly-passed legislation on the basis of alleged (and hypothetical) Charter infringements.    The ""authority of Parliament"" is irrelevant and has literally nothing to do with this decision.   It has everything to do with this decision.  From the ruling, discussing the legal test for an interlocutory injunction:    [51] While  the  government  does  not  have  a  monopoly  on  the  public  interest, the  onus  of  demonstrating irreparable harm to a public authority is less than that of a private applicant. The test will usually be satisfied upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or  protecting  the  public  interest  and  upon  some  indication that  the  impugned  legislation was enacted pursuant to that responsibility. The court should usually assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result from the staying the implementation of that legislation.    and    [52] When  the nature  and  declared  purpose  of  legislation  is  to  promote  the public interest,  a  motions court should not investigate whether the legislation actually has such an effect. It must be assumed to do so."

CanadaPolitics,3dn9le,_Ogopogo_,7,Fri Jul 17 23:58:05 2015 UTC,"I have quite a few issues with this...  Firstly, even if this was 'grassroots organized', it is still a bit of a slap in the face to your volunteers and supporters. The fact that you have a functional executive in your community suggests that people want to see a candidate from your party on the ballot; trust me, I've lived in 'demoralized' ridings where trying to get an executive together is like pulling teeth.   Yes, it sucks to live in a riding where your candidate doesn't have a chance; but every election and candidate out on the doorsteps helps build your brand and gain potential support for the future. Bowing out and saying 'hey, vote for these guys instead' just shoots you in the foot for the future.  Yes, everyone who isn't a Tory wants to see Harper booted from office; but these sort of agreements have a huge potential to turn off your actual supporters and volunteers in the area. After all, it happened this year, so what about the next election? Are you going to find a candidate, or volunteers for the executive, if they think the candidate is just going to fold out?  Secondly, if this is about putting the 'best chance forward', then the 4th place candidate endorsing the 3rd isn't necessarily doing that. 308 has the Greens at 10.5%, Libs at 22.4% the NDP at 26.8%, and the Tories at 38.7%  Yes, combined the Lib-Green vote shoots to 32.9%; but that's still 5.8% behind the Tories...as opposed to say 37.3% for the NDP-Green, which puts them 1.4% behind the Tories, a much more manageable climb. (Also, we're assuming then that all the Greens move to Liberal candidate, which I don't think all will. Some will, some won't, so the 5.8% gap is generous.)  I think it's easier to convince your members to flood en masse to a different candidate when the point gap is less than 2%, within most margins of error, as opposed to a nearly 6% gap. So, mathematically (admittedly, not my strong suit) this just doesn't make sense. So, I don't know if the whole argument of ""let's put our best chance of winning ahead"" actually flies in this example when you look at the current polling data.  Let's be completely honest, the Greens have been slagging off the NDP for months. From accusations that Mulcair is blocking May from the debates (which really, how does that make any sense?) to vowing to throw everything they can at Victoria to unseat an incumbent NDP MP (which is odd, when they talk about uniting against the Tories to then target a sitting non-Tory MP). The Greens are open for cooperation, but apparently only if your party is red and begins with the letter L."
CanadaPolitics,3dn9le,sstelmaschuk,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:11 2015 UTC,The obvious answer of why they went with the Liberal and not NDP is that the Liberal candidate agreed with the idea of almost representing both parties.  Maybe the NDP would not agree with that.  I think the Greens and Liberals are much closer ideologically as well.
CanadaPolitics,3dn9le,Iustis,6,Fri Jul 17 20:37:24 2015 UTC,"In the article, it says the Greens went to the NDP with the same proposal, but it got shot down at the national level.  Another factor could be that Trudeau supports May being in the debates, and Mulcair doesn't. There seems to generally be more animosity between the NDP and the Greens, than between the Liberals and the Greens. I've seen this provincially as well.

CanadaPolitics,3dn9le,Iustis,3,Fri Jul 17 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"I never said I don't get why they went with the Liberals; I said that the argument of putting the best chance of defeating Harper doesn't fly when you look at the numbers.  Without a doubt, if the Liberals were more agreeable to a deal, then it makes sense to deal with them. But at least say that is the primary reason. To try and wrap in, ""this guy is our best shot to defeat the Tories"" when the math doesn't bear that out is disingenuous at best.  But, that's what it hinged on here; not actually presenting the best option to defeat Harper and his local candidate, but which party would offer the best chance for input after the election.  I'll also note that the article has been updated since I first posted, and comments from former Green Executive Member Angela Nagy are proving my first point: this is a potential problem for the Greens long term, as it damages the brand in that riding and undercuts volunteers and future efforts to find and run candidates.    The Green-Liberal co-operation plan, however, has angered some local Greens. Angela Nagy, the riding’s former chief executive officer and sitting board member, for example, is hoping the national office will put a stop to the Fuhr-Adams agreement. Nagy acknowledged that Adams was transparent about his plan to withdraw as the official Green candidate and that the majority of the 45 Green members who attended Thursday’s meeting were aware of it. But she believes the riding association had no authority to sign such an agreement with Fuhr and that it should be rejected on the grounds that it doesn’t respect a party resolution that the Greens will run candidates in every riding. “The Green party has worked long and hard, and its members have worked long and hard, to establish a political party that represents the values of its members, and those values cannot be represented by another party,” she told HuffPost.   45 Members at a nomination meeting, who were aware of the candidate wanting to step down to endorse the Liberals. Yet the Greens got a little over 5,000 in the last election, a good deal more than the small percentage who gave their blessing to this candidate and this course of action.  The polling has the momentum on the Tories' side in this riding; and this deal is very unlikely to change that. Instead, it's just serving now as a case example of what NOT to do in a pre-election cooperation attempt. This is a misstep for the Greens, and it's going to set them back decades in this riding (and it may even have national implications on overall trust/willingness to support the party).   As I mentioned earlier, it's hard to find volunteers and candidates in a riding where your team is 'demoralized'. Even if this was done with the best of intention, it's now established doubt in the party's willingness to get candidates on the ballot and keep them there. This is doubly so due to the fact that it's in a riding where they weren't competitive and the party they're endorsing isn't much better either.     A noble idea, but very poorly executed, and definitely NOT done just to unseat Cannan."

I still expect this to be the Cannan Bowman show, and for Cannan to handily win that contest.  Musings edit:  In fact, if the Greens don't replace Adams I could see this helping Bowman more than anyone, as the lay Green voter just tags the NDP when they can't find a Green candidate on their ballot.  Updated article edit:  They've updated the article with commentary from two other players Mrs. Nagy and Dr. Ryder.  For anyone who cares Mrs. Nagy, the Green member decrying the deal, is by far the most influential of the three (Ryder, Adams, and Nagy).  She's a former city councilor and was once considered one of the more interesting members of the Green party (she ran for the Greens here in '06 and '08).  By interesting I mean to say that she mattered to the party and I think was once considered to be one of their better up and comers.  Dr. Ryder's an awesome dude, had a lecture with him, but I'm not sure how far his rep extends off of campus and I tend to disagree with him on this matter.

CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,d-boom,9,Fri Jul 17 21:34:10 2015 UTC,Fun fact: you don't hear stories of Francophones being refused service in English hospitals across the country because French-speakers from the ROC aren't entitled to the point of believing that they can be served in their language everywhere.
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,BenDionne,2,Sat Jul 18 09:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that is accurate.  If someone is entitled to a service in their particular language, they can then expect to be served in that language.  Period.  Do francophones in the rest of Canada feel less entitled to their legal language entitlements simply because they are francophones in Canada?  Who knows, I don't think you can say that with any degree of certainty.  I know if I was a French speaker and I had to attend in court, for example, I would raise a stink if the judge told me I couldn't receive court services in French and denied me my right to a bilingual proceeding.  Perhaps we don't hear the same stories from the rest of Canada because there is a better legal framework to protect the French language.  That is an equally plausible explanation."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,quasiregular,0,Sat Jul 18 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"No you don't hear much about it because ROC French Canadians are almost all bilingual and because they've been raised up to be second class citizens. There is some fuss now and then, BC parents going to the SCC for equal schools, an Albertan motorist going to the SCC to have access to justice in French but at large they're just resigned to the fact it's their job to adapt, not the other way around.  I mean if a bunch of provinces can't manage to translate their website in French and inkeeping with the fact that bilingualism there is almost non existant, I wouldn't expect that there are many services being provided in French."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,M3k4nism,2,Sat Jul 18 16:18:22 2015 UTC,"As you have noted, when francophones feel legally entitled to receive some service in French, they will fight for it.  Of course they have to adapt and learn to become bilingual in predominantly English provinces, otherwise they would be at a serious disadvantage if they expected to get by speaking exclusively French.  The same goes for anglophones in Quebec; they would be well advised to adapt to the majority language and be bilingual.  Just seems like a wise move, but it certainly doesn't mean that francophones are being oppressed in other provinces simply because they should know English.  The individual in the posted article was actually bilingual, but wanted medical services in his native language to avoid missing some critical detail of his medical treatment.  This is precisely the reason why there is protection of certain English services in Quebec and protection of certain French services in the rest of Canada."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,quasiregular,3,Sat Jul 18 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Protection of English services in Québec is light years beyond protection of French services in the ROC. For instance you can go to a hospital anywhere in Québec and get treated in English. If services are somewhat sub par or not delivered in a timely fashion you'll have a good case to present to anglo medias to demonstrate Québec's intolerance toward English. Switch the situation around and I'm fairly certain I couldn't get treatment in French in Flin Flon or in Red Deer, at least nowhere near as well as I could get treatment in English in Sept-Iles or Shawinigan.  This is unsurprising seeing as ROC Canadians don't learn French while English is being learnt in Québec. Things have been like this forever, that's why ROC francophones are fine with having lesser services and that's why ROC non-francophones are fine with providing lesser services to francophones."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,M3k4nism,2,Sat Jul 18 16:42:17 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot of conjecture and speculation.  Bottom line is that if you are legally entitled to some sort of language protection, then you are within your rights to fight for that protection.  There is nothing wrong with doing that.  There are many examples of both French and English speakers seeking the protection of their language rights, through the media , in courts, and other avenues for redress."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,quasiregular,2,Sat Jul 18 17:07:14 2015 UTC,"Canada was built with protecting English in mind, that's why from the 1867 constitution it was the solely French majority Québec that was made bilingual. Following confederation French was stripped of state services by all other provinces starting with education. By large French services in the ROC are mediocre, plain and simple. You can't expect Alberta and Saskatchewan to properly serve their francophone minorities when they can't even get their website translated.   Above and beyond legalities, I'm arguing for fairness and respect. Y'all don't appreciate the fact that Québec provide bilingual services, you expect it. I expect the same of other provinces. I've never understood how people could argue that Québec is against bilingualism when their own province won't do a tenth of what we do to accommodate our minority.  Honestly, how would you feel if Québec's anglophones were denied equal schools, if they were denied access to justice in English? My guess is, you'd be furious and rightly so still ROC francophones face and have always been facing such issues and it's routine. If they win they'll get some concessions but if they loose it will have cemented the fact that they're an official language minority with lesser rights."

The dude went to a FRENCH hospital in a FRENCH neighbourhood in a FRENCH province, it was not an emergency (filling in hospital card) and he decided to not speak French? That is 99.99% his problem. Don't blame the hospital staff who was fully within his rights to speak to him in French. He could have easily gone to any number of English institutions which are very much over represented as others in /r/canada have pointed out (cc /u/cortisol ... )  I'm sorry, but even as a Quebecker angryphone c'est assez la.     By all of which I mean, please stop apologizing for 101. It's over, we're done arguing about it, that's the law and if (someone) doesn't like it they can learn French or leave."
CanadaPolitics,3do5vc,swilts,13,Sat Jul 18 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"What? No. People have the right to be served in French and English in Québec, especially in a hospital of all places.  The clerk was being massively unpleasant not to use more degrading terms,  she has no excuse, she was specifically hired because of her supposed knowledge of both French and English. She doesn't choose what language people speak, she's at their service. For me this is ground for a suspension and for her to be fired if she does it again in the future.  Now this position might seem odd coming from myself a language hawk and a Québec nationalist but Québec needs to keep the moral high ground. If other provinces can't bother to give their francophones reciprocity to our anglophones regarding provincial services, well it's a shame on them and Canada."

If the reaction is ""well now everyone is going to say we're all English-haters"", then that's getting things backwards.    The problem is that Quebec does have a cohort for whom the promotion of French language and culture actually means ""oppress anyone and anything that isn't 'nous'"".  Is that everyone?  Obviously not, and I suspect it's a small minority that is getting louder and more strident as they feel their influence waning among the population at large.  It certainly does exist.  You see it in the ridiculous tin-pot language police who address the serious danger of Chinese restaurants having signage in Chinese that isn't sufficiently less prominent than the French sign, and who seriously investigate Italian words on a menu in an Italian restaurant.  The people who think that if your first language isn't French you don't really belong in Quebec.  (Or if you speak Creole on your break at work with your friends, this is a matter for official investigation.)  Sadly, some people in Quebec do hate English people or more precisely, anyone who isn't their kind of Quebecois.  (That creole example above is real and had nothing to do with English.)  Many?

In terms of its (mis)use of terminology, the author should know very well that we have a fiscal union in Canada (as do all federations sharing a common national government), so I am not sure what is being suggested.  As for the suggestion that provinces are projected to default or that subnational debt is federally guaranteed.... no... just no.  Even the barest belief in an efficient market illustrates the existence of a non-negligible risk premium when downgrading from federal to provincial sovereign paper.  This is only appropriate when considering the differences in fiscal capacity between a national and subnational entity not in control of its currency.  But nowhere are these risk premiums even approaching anywhere close to those charged on debt securities bearing significant default risk.  Perhaps the author should look first at the spread with high quality corporate debt, as it tends to illustrate the effect of the addition of a small amount of company-specific default risk into the interest rate equation.  Companies (and countries) that are actually projected as highly subject to default risk are charged much, much higher premiums.  Placing any province on this level requires the refutation of the market interpretation  of publicly available fiscal and debt data (the same data used by the author to argue their point); something that any journalist would struggle mightily to do."

But I really couldn't figure out how this term pay equity was calculated until I found this:  http://pec.mcgill.ca/pedefined.html   A good way of defining something is often to start with what it is not. Pay Equity is not equal access to jobs offered by an employer. This is called employment equity, which means that women and men and the visible minorities have equal opportunity when applying for jobs. Nor is it the fact that a person working in company X is being paid $2,000 less than the person of the same gender sitting nearby for the exact same job. This is called internal equity and is unrelated to employment equity.   I actually am inclined to side with Joan on this; although, I would like to see pay gaps for the exact same job.

We've known for decades that punishment in grade school isn't handed out equally, with boys seeing disproportionate physical punishment and getting official attention for the same behaviour more often.  So, sure, there's some pockets where girls are being discouraged, but that's largely subsumed in a system that's firmly leaned towards them in a general sense, and that's reflected in the widening gap between women and men at the baccalaureate level."

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,rainmakerlariato,5,Fri Jul 17 23:54:36 2015 UTC,"If someone is less willing to hire a woman because they believe they will have children someday and, conforming with social norms, take time off for family reasons, how can they get the experience?   You're into the insurance argument.  If insurance can ramp up rates for the statistically much more likely to be involved in an accident males, then business can make the same kind of decisions based around child care.  Both decisions are arguably justified if the statistics of the pool justify the decision in a financial sense.  Any business that thinks of employees in aggregate, which is pretty much any business with a labour pool larger than a small handful of people, is going to trend towards making decisions based around aggregate behaviour.  How can you truly police that, and can you honestly tell them they HAVE to incur greater costs by allowing those childless women their due, while knowing that this means they will also be stuck with a bunch of women having kids and driving up their labour and retraining costs?  I've seen women serially abuse the system around maternity leave, come back just long enough to qualify again, and then bolt.  I've seen women come back for a week, find out they miss being a house Mommy, and bolt, leaving the business with a big bill for retraining and hiring that could have been avoided.  There are real costs around accommodating child care for a company. As long as those costs exist, companies will seek to minimize them, and aggregate decision making is one of the methods."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,Vault_Tec_Boy,21,Fri Jul 17 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"The ""wage gap"" is a myth when you account for level of experience, time taken off work for family reasons, and willingness to negotiate salary.   I guess you could call it a myth when you remove the reasons for it happening?  Experience? It's almost as though women have been in large numbers, in the full-time workforce, for only a couple generations... due to gender roles, discrimination etc.   This one will quite likely work itself out, as we generally don't have 65 year old experienced men going after the same jobs as 25 year old women, even if they're in the same field... the old men get replaced with young men, and on experience, the gap gets smaller and smaller.  Time taken off work for family reasons? I honestly have absolutely no idea how this one gets tossed aside as a reason that somehow doesn't count.   This is a massive factor. Society's gender roles teach us that when someone is sick/injured, its mostly the woman/moms job to stay home and deal with that. Have a child? Huge penalty to women's earnings, while studies have shown having a child helps a man's career (for a noteworthy example: Stephen Harper lecturing Peter MacKay that he needed to settle down and get a wife and kids). While some of these 'norms' are slowly being challenged, this is still a huge factor in earnings gaps.   Societies that have been able to erode these outdated norms, and yes they are outdated, real policy action has taken place. For example, in Sweden, and they just actually extended this too, on top of their being very generous family leave benefits, a portion of it can only be claimed by the father (or the 'secondary' parent in same sex relationship). This was done so that employers and society in general got used to the notion that men can take time off work to be parents too. It has been very successful.   Willingness to negotiate salary? While not quite to the same degree as time off, this is another one that doesn't make sense to toss aside. Young girls are taught to act like ""girls"". How quickly will a young women be labelled a bitch for doing the same thing that would get a young man a ""go-getter""? Gender roles, and how we teach people to act have a real impact. It impacts how the individual acts, and how society perceives them for acting.   That also extends to career choice as well.   I find that too often when we talk about these gender gaps, we do it very superficially. In your case, you identified 3 legitimate reasons as to why there would be a gap... but instead of exploring why those things are causing a gap, and what could done to reduce it, you imply they don't count.   Edit: What I'm trying to say, is that largely, gender discrimination is far, far less overt and on the individual level than it was decades ago. This is a great thing, and we should be happy about that. I would think it is a very small minority of employers that are intentionally paying women less or not hiring them on the basis that they are women. Again, in the realm of thanking ourselves, society has largely deemed those people assholes.  What we still have, as a result of gender norms, social gender roles etc, are more systemic and structural issues."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,jjbus34,8,Fri Jul 17 14:18:23 2015 UTC,"I guess you could call it a myth when you remove the reasons for it happening?   When the factors that remove them are personal choices people and families make ... yes.   Society's gender roles teach us that when someone is sick/injured, its mostly the woman/moms job to stay home and deal with that.   Absolutely, and when polled in Canada around shared parenting, Canadians overwhelmingly say they are ready for shared parenting to be the norm, with polls around this kind of legislation showing 72-80% support for it.  The bills don't pass, though, and here's the kicker ... many feminist organizations oppose the legislation.  They rally around the ""best interests of the child"" angle to do it, but they still oppose it, and they are doing it clear across North America.  NOW has opposed these initiatives in multiple states in the US, for example.  When many women are actively fighting to keep this child care role reserved for themselves, it's pretty tough to call it discrimination.   Societies that have been able to erode these outdated norms, and yes they are outdated, real policy action has taken place.    Yes, they have, but they had to mandate paternity to see it.  When left to their own devices, families with equal opportunity to share paternity and maternity ... don't.  Overwhelmingly, families have the woman at home, the man at work, and offering paternity just gives the man a couple of weeks with his child shortly after the birth.  Until that equalizes, and places like Sweden had to force the issue, you will still have women taking the lion's share of the time off around kids.   instead of exploring why those things are causing a gap, and what could done to reduce it, you imply they don't count.   They don't count as discrimination, though.  No employer forces women to take more STD and LTD than men do ... but they do.  No employer forces women to take more family days or sick days ... but they do.  There is nothing going on here that the employer does to those employees, these are choices those employees are making for themselves.  It's not discrimination if that family decides that Mom does the child care.  That's a choice, and while that choice may be largely shaped and informed by cultural practices, it's still a choice and nothing to do with the employer at all.  Edit:     What we still have, as a result of gender norms, social gender roles etc, are more systemic and structural issues.   See, you DO get it, when you parse all the data.  The issue here isn't a man issue or a woman issue, it's both.  We both have been living in these social roles for centuries, and all the legislation in the world won't break those differences overnight.  Equal pay for equal work is OVERWHELMINGLY happening in this country, but men and women simply work differently.  That's not the fault of the employers, who overwhelmingly follow the rules.  That's our fault.  So, women can carp about the wage gap all they want, but as long as it's individual choices that make up the bulk of it, the only solution is for people to make different choices.  Men can start to pick up the child care, but that's only part of the battle and we're seeing significant resistance to equalizing this space.  Women also have to pick up more of the heavy lifting jobs and start to take on jobs that are less safe, out of town, etc. for more lucrative pay.  Until they do, the gap's going nowhere."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,Vault_Tec_Boy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:36 2015 UTC,"Ok first off you can't attack someone for not proposing a solution or not expanding on their point because you want them to.  Taking time off is relevant and related to experience. An employer doesn't care that you were in a coma for 5 years or decided to stay home and raise a baby for 5 years and they shouldn't. What they do care about are whether or not you were able to maintain or improve your skills and if you have better qualifications and experience then anyone else applying. Not doing anything in a field for 5 years looks like a big hole in your resume that impacts how much you are worth to them.   Negotiating can cause an increase in your pay. I don't know the science behind it but that doesn't mean it isn't relevant. Just look at sports if the best player ever didn't negotiate for a higher salary and always just took what he was offered then he wouldn't be making as much money as he could be. Just look at how much kessel was getting paid by the leafs, he wasn't worth that much to other organisations but he was worth that much to the lesfs at the time even though they didn't want to pay him that much they did. Also their are societal expectations on both men and women to the point where a year or 2 ago a bunch of articles were coming out about how education systems were failing males. It's not just a one way street if you can point to something that would directly impact negotiating a salary then maybe you have a point, but even then that is a weak arguement.   I'm not sure what you mean by extending to job choices as well, but I'm going to assume you mean your argument about social expectations. Now this could be taken as you want all jobs to pay the same amount. I'm going to assume you don't want your mail man, paper boy or cashier earning as much as a doctor, engineer or computer scientist because that is a whole different arguement then men and women getting equal pay. The problem with this argument is that you are saying it's society's fault that women take jobs that pay less. Now I'm sure you could make an argument that it has an impact, but we aren't talking about how to encourage women and men to take all jobs equally we are talking about equal pay. So what we mean is that people getting equal pay for the same amount of work with the same experience and everything. So comparing a doctor to a fast food employee and calling it a wage gap doesn't make much sense.  These issues that you bring up are cultural issues not wage gap issues. It's not the fault of a company or the government that less women want to work in IT and would rather teach. Yes you could say that it is an inherent issue with our culture and we should work to change it, but that doesn't mean people are getting paid less for the same work.   Now I don't know for sure if there is a wage gap or not, but I do know that men working in hire paying jobs and women working in lower paying jobs is not a wage gap. That could be an issue but it's not something that is stopping people from doing the job that they want without equal pay. There are issues that some people think a government should tackle and some people think they shouldn't. This is an issue that falls on both sides when people question whether a government should influence (intentionally) our every day culture and to what degree."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,gronmin,10,Fri Jul 17 15:40:33 2015 UTC,"Ok first off you can't attack someone for not proposing a solution or not expanding on their point because you want them to.   I'm not attacking at all. The poster rightly identified 3 causes, I simply expressed that these reasons shouldn't be 'controlled for', they should be examined.   It appears you have significantly misread what I've said. I'll try to address that.   Taking time off is relevant and related to experience.    Of course it is. I looked at the two separately, as that what's the poster I responded to did. Your entire paragraph looks at this from an individual employee to individual employer standpoint. As I said, we need to go further than that and look at why the time off and reduced experience is happening... much of this has to do with societal norms and gender roles.   I'm not blaming an employer for wanting more experience, I'm saying that our social norms disproportionately cause women to fall behind their male counterparts, because its generally assumed they'll take one for the team (the family) and take the majority of the time off.  The family leave policies of Sweden, like I mentioned took a policy approach to reducing the stereotype in a positive way. It sent a message their society needs to get used men being more active parents.   Negotiating can cause an increase in your pay.   Of course it can. I prefer collective bargaining via unionization, but if you're not unionized, of course negotiating for better pay etc is a good idea. What I said around this point again goes to social norm and gender roles. If women acted like tough negotiating, ""go-getter"" men, its still quite likely they'll be a labelled a bitch, not a go-getter. Social norms have taught people that its less normal for women to act that way, so women are less likely to do it, and people have a more negative view of the behaviour because its not normal.    Now this could be taken as you want all jobs to pay the same amount   No it couldn't be at all. I'm saying that gender role and social norms help form us from a very young age. Take 'getting your hands dirty' jobs like mechanics. If a young girl wants to help daddy work on the car, she gets labelled. She is no longer called a girl, she's a tomboy. Whether its meant positively (I'd say most parents and family members are not trying to be negative when they use it now) or not, its an act of 'othering'. She is told that she is different for wanting to do that. Where as a young boy is celebrated for helping dad on the car.    but we aren't talking about how to encourage women and men to take all jobs equally we are talking about equal pay.   Sorry, I am talking about how to encourage women and men to take all jobs more equally, and take on familial responsibilities more equally. Both women taking on ""man"" jobs, and men taking on ""woman"" jobs; and both men and women taking on family responsibilities.    These issues that you bring up are cultural issues not wage gap issues.   I'm not sure if you read my post. That's what I'm saying. When we talk about the wage gap, many seem to fixate on it at a very superficial level, instead of looking at the cultural and social roles and norms that we teach people from a very young age. It is far less likely today than in the past for overt employment discrimination based on sexuality, but gaps get created due to social norms and roles changing slower in our minds than on the ground.    There are issues that some people think a government should tackle and some people think they shouldn't.    Which is why I provided the example of Sweden's family leave policies.    This is an issue that falls on both sides when people question whether a government should influence (intentionally) our every day culture and to what degree.   I'd say in this case, its government, and our head's needing to catch up with what is already happening. We're lagging behind what's happening around us."

But to be fair the comment you are replying to and most of the comments here seem to be written with a very strong opinion behind them. And your opening seems to carry that same feeling.  I think you should add that superficial line to the front of your post as it does feel like it changes the context of what you are talking about. It changes it from a post about how the wage gap is a thing because society pushes men into hire paying jobs and women into lower paying jobs etc. to a post about societal issues as a whole.   Also, when I said we what I meant was the general conversation that was going on in the comments and the comment you replied to. I also think you should go back and read my post again as it seems you just went it's not what I was talking about/meant and moved on. When I think the post as a whole does convey the idea that the wage gap as described by you is not a wage gap, but another issue entirely. Yes it could cause a wage gap when comparing the income of all men to all women, but when people talk about a wage gap they are generally referring to the issue that women earn less doing the same job as a man.   And on the government influence thing I would say that it is an issue whenever there is a big cultural shift that one side in this case the individual are thinking differently then the other side in this case the government and culture. Most people would agree that our culture encourages people to do one thing or another based on their gender and it is starting to catch up with the individual, but it is going to take time."

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,24PercentMajority,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:12:33 2015 UTC,"And again we should look at why the wife is in the lower paying job. Is it because they know that when kids pull them away from work the financial hit will be less, or is it because they truly want to do that work?

The most complete analyses I've seen still leave about a 5% gap, and from more specific studies it's reasonable to expect that bias causes some of that remainder. Bias against resumes with a woman's name on it is pretty clear in some fields, for example.  I'm yet to be convinced there's a sufficiently clear-cut overall bias that can be effectively handled by federal policy, but it is an issue."

And how it works is overwhelmingly job choice, job tenure, and committed hours to the job.  Those three factors are choices women make, not discrimination.  Why  we go to the lengths we do to hack apart the gap is to discover what's actually discrimination and what isn't.  When you control for personal choices, the portion of the gap that's left where discrimination has room to live gets really small.  Now, I'm fine if we want to talk about what we need to do to nibble down that remaining 5% that could arguably still hold discrimination, but I'm not fine at all with women's groups or political agents misrepresenting the entire gap as discrimination to forward an agenda."

If men and women were earning the same amounts this would just be indicative of a different problem because it would mean that men are  putting much more effort into obtaining money, sacrificing other perks that jobs with lower pay tend to offer instead, just to end up being paid what the average woman is  paid.  Equal pay would literally represent the fact that men have to pursue money much more vigorously just to earn the same amount as a woman."

We prioritize work differently, money differently, and manage the work-life balance differently.  A lot of the discussion on this topic revolves around the penalties women face for being the primary child care providers and while that's a pretty easily measurable fact, no one really goes that extra mile and examines how the other social role - that of the provider - affects men.  For decades, we've known that men suffer from stress and lifestyle related illnesses more than women.  As more and more women enter the workforce and earn their own living, those stats are starting to equalize, which is something we probably should have expected.  What price have men paid, both from a health perspective and from a family or social perspective, for committing all those hours to the simple act of bringing in income?  Making that extra income doesn't come without costs, and those costs are stress related illnesses, workplace injuries and fatalities, greater rates of alcoholism and drug addiction, significant differences in suicide rates, etc.  In a lot of ways, I think women have the superior balance, but ramping men back to that level will be difficult when the basic social expectation is that if someone gets to stay home, it's Mom.  Being from Alberta, I know a lot of single income families where Dad is raking in big oil money, and Mom sits at home and ""tends house"", or who works a dead end job because she can.  There will be significant back pressure when the social push hits to get these women to contribute more heavily so their partners can ease off."

Over-representation compared to what?  The general population?  Why would you compare them to the general population when the vast majority of those people are not qualified or even in the running for a CEO position?  So who is in the running for most CEO positions?  Well, given that the average age of a Fortune 500 CEO is 64 and these these people tend to have decades of experience in their respective industries, you're typically looking at a talent pool that reflects the demographics of who entered that industry (or business in general) about ~45 years ago.  If those people are disproportionately white males, and CEOs are disproportionately white males, then CEOs being disproportionately white males is not ""over""-representative of anything.  You may as well be complaining that we hardly have any teenage or early 20's CEOs.  Well, duh, those people aren't in the talent pool for these companies either, it doesn't mean they're being discriminated against.  If business grads/entrants 45 years ago where 80% male and 20% female, even a gender ratio for CEOs that had 30% females would actually be over-representative of women, not men."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,gointothelight,2,Fri Jul 17 13:45:48 2015 UTC,"You seem to be not understanding how it actually works.  In order to get the jobs, that get you the jobs, that allow you to make an impression on the executive level and above, you need to start your network somewhere. Because the people in the power and influence positions are mostly men, it is easier for men to find mentors, socialize with the next level above them, etc.  When promotions and key staffing decisions are determined, people have a tendency to pick people they know, or people like themselves. So men get more opportunity to show their potential, are more likely to be mentored, and are thus more likely to get those VP and C-level positions down the road. This sort of pattern is very common in my industry.  Where I work, roughly 30% of the staff (male dominated tech firm) are women. Possibly 10% of the director level positions are women. There is a single woman at the VP level and above. There are zero women on the board."

The fact remains that CEOs are not selected from the general population using job seeker demographics from 2015, so claiming CEOs should represent the general population in this way is just ridiculous.  The people pursuing these positions are not reflective of the general population and were even less so ~40 years ago when the current talent pool for CEOs was being formed.  Why are you not outraged about the lack of young CEOs?  They aren't as many of them for the exact same reason that there aren't as many women CEOs.

They are generally selected from the next layer down in those organizations, who are selected from the next layer down, until you get to the entry level.  In most fields, certainly law and medicine, the population is roughly equal at the entry level. As you move up the seniority curve you would expect that to stay the same, all things being equal.  You don't. Not even close. Not even in the fields like medicine where women have been well represented for decades. There is something systemic going on, and I've suggested a hypothesis for what that something is.

When we do child care, we're ""babysitting"" or we're ""helping Mommy out"" and it's pretty much a de facto assumption that we don't know what we're doing and Mommy will do it much more effectively.  Many in situ test situations show that men get more grief when they hang out near kids than women do, pretty much across the western world.

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,C21H20BrN3,10,Fri Jul 17 10:12:31 2015 UTC,"The point I was making about the comparison of different subgroups is that if you have four subgroups—childless women, mothers, childless men, and fathers—there are six different combinations of subgroups we could compare (five if you exclude the fathers-childless men pair). And picking only people under 30 could be well justified, but it's an additional restriction. Without an explanation of what the childless-men-vs-childless-women study was going for, I can't help thinking the study tried to cut up subpopulations in every way it could and picked put the one pair of groups where women made more than men. Don't you find that suspicious?   And I mean, I don't even think the stories we could tell about those groups prove that sexism isn't real or whatever. If childless women earn more than childless men but fathers earn more than mothers, then maybe the reason is that women get penalized in the labour market for having children whereas men get rewarded. But we don't know! That one statistic isn't enough for us to tell.   I don't see anyone in the article claiming that there's widespread overt sexism, or what some people call ""explicit bias"". Feminists these days tend to be concerned about institutional or cultural barriers to equal participation by women in the labour market. Someone in the article mentions lack of access to child care, for example.   The article on the apes mentions that multi-male, multi-female groups are the most common social arrangement among our nearest animal cousins. Does this mean that monogamy is just as futile and unnatural as is an early human woman going out to pick berries?   Edit: I don't understand why so many people in this thread are treating statistical comparisons that shrink or reverse the wage gap as grounds to dismiss any claims that the advocacy group is making in this article. Should not statistical analysis be the start of a conversation that improves our understanding of the wage gap and why it arises, not the end of it?"

I don't think women are 'penalized' but it's just that naturally women focus on their children more than their work and that results in less promotions. This is just my theory, I have no evidence to prove that this is the reason.  I don't get the 'cultural barrier' argument either. Maybe it's due to the bubble I live in because every woman in my close family (aunts, grandmothers, mother) is in a STEM field but I just don't see women being culturally barred from STEM fields. The general trend seems to be that women are simply not interested in the high paying fields in our society. For the ones that are, it's actually easier to get into the high paying fields. MIT for instance has an acceptance rate of 12% for men while it has an acceptance rate of 27% for women.  No, I'm not saying it's impossible for women to 'go out and pick berries'. We have developed consciousness so we can make choices instead of purely following instincts. And yes, monogamy is unnatural.

Meh, even if you're talking salaried positions, the amount of time you spend at work will heavily come into play when it comes time for promotions.   The person that hustles and burns the midnight oil is more likely to be rewarded with a promotion than the person that has to leave on the dot in order to pick the kids up from school / day care, etc.   And, unfortunately, the latter person is more likely to be a woman than a man in most households.

It's illogical to accept that women (and any dependants they may have) would bear the full financial burden through lower income.    Well, when we're getting to this, it probably more works the other way. If you have a dual parent household with the woman as the sole earner, that's most likely to be the case because she has a higher earning potential than her husband.   So a lot of that stuff that leads women to not succeed as much at work isn't a factor (or at least not as much of a factor), because the husband is the one who is primarily in charge of taking care of the kids.  As you said, this is becoming increasingly common, which shouldn't be all that surprising, what with women also being the ones most likely to pursuit higher educations now-a-days.

If it's the fact that one gender is more likely to choose a particular course of action that is leading to these gaps, then refraining from making those choices is the solution to the problem.   If the choices that people are making are causing issues, then the problem is best solves by convincing people to not make those choices, not by attempting to force employers to give equal benefits to different types of employees when they're not getting equal work out of those employees due to the difference in those lifestyle choices.    As others have noted in this thread, not all women have children; as I said, above, procreation is good for society as a whole.

I believe that governments play a very important role in shaping and leading the societies that they are elected to represent.   The Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal treatment for all, and makes specific reference to gender, among groups.  The expectation, then, is that inequities will be addressed. Because of the ""bottom line profits"" focus that motivates the private sector, they wouldn't likely be motivated to address these types of social policy issues. If government doesn't address them, the status quo reigns.   These types of studies inform that policy thinking and solutions development. For example, as noted in the article, the House of Commons Committee on the Status of Women exists for just this purpose; there is also a Status of Women Minister in government that ""promotes equality for women and their full participation in the economic, social and democratic life of Canada.""  http://www.swc-cfc.gc.ca/abu-ans/index-eng.html  ""Promote"" is an active verb. The government of the day brushing findings such as these away looks more like avoiding than promoting to me.   Contrast this with the government's zeal to pour resources into prohibiting a minute number of women from wearing burqas at citizenship ceremonies and I think we've got our priorities mixed up."

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,amish4play,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:06:26 2015 UTC,What I can extrapolate is that it can be done and that there should be no massive offset in a career that may have spanned 10+ years just because you took off 9 months.
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,5140nomad,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"Getting a promotion after returning from a leave of absence is not normal for men either. I can only speculate that you either go lucky or are valuable to the company. Your specific company would have likely done the same for a good employee on mat-leave as well.   there should be no massive offset in a career   There is no massive offset just for taking 8 months to a year off. Being a good parent is what kills careers, not doing overtime, or taking work home, going on business trips, etc. It's unfortunate that child rearing and chasing a career are at odds."

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,5140nomad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:57:48 2015 UTC,But either gender can do that. So its irrelevant.
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,abacabbmk,6,Fri Jul 17 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"point is that taking time off for a male does not hinder income levels, so taking time off for having a kid should also not hinder income level.  Both genders can also take parental leave these days, mind blowing I know."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,5140nomad,3,Fri Jul 17 14:41:11 2015 UTC,"Parental leave is different than missing time for doctor visits, and time spent in the hospital during labour, and time afterwards (i dont think any women go back to work right away, because of many physical/health reasons).   Women are not just babysitting before/during/after pregnancy. They need time off. Thats even assuming there are no complications or that a c-section is not required. Ive seen multiple co-workers take 2 months of leave before their baby is due, because of complications or sickness. its not uncommon."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,abacabbmk,6,Fri Jul 17 14:43:51 2015 UTC,"you completely missed everything i was trying to say.  I said I took 8 months off with no hit to income and even had an increase, whereas people are saying that a women who takes 8-9 months of time off should expect a hit to income."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,5140nomad,3,Fri Jul 17 14:50:26 2015 UTC,"I said I took 8 months off with no hit to income and even had an increase   What I think you're missing is that this is an anecdote, not a statistic.  Until you can show that your experience is the norm, so that most men taking off that 8 months come back to a job and a raise, your point is empty.  And you simply have to know that your experience is the exception, not the rule.  Most men that vanish for 8 months are lucky to come back to employment at all."

CanadaPolitics,3dlank,Randomfinn,9,Fri Jul 17 16:36:26 2015 UTC,So ALL child-bearing age women should just accept that they get paid less even if they do not/can not have children?  Why penalise ALL women from 15-45?
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,Gears_and_Beers,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:06 2015 UTC,"It's my penalizing all women just the summation of all women. A women who doesn't have kids and runs their career like their male counter parts will make the same.   The issue is when you look at all women there are large chunks of the sample who take years off their career, those years of experience and opportunities are lost for ever."
CanadaPolitics,3dlank,Palpz,2,Fri Jul 17 12:06:20 2015 UTC,"I believe the point was that the women who do that have their career impacted; when they take more time off from work immediately after childbirth and put less emphasis upon their work than working fathers do, by taking time off for other child care related activities.   The actions taken by them impact their earnings, which of course when you add it all up has an impact upon the overall earnings of women as a whole.   This of course combines with other factors, like women being less likely to pursuit an education and employment in the most lucrative fields.  But that doesn't mean that a woman who goes after a high paying job, doesn't have kids or one who gets the other parent to be the primary child care giver, and negotiates just as hard for her pay and benefits will have the same impact upon her salary,"

CanadaPolitics,3do9y3,Juggernaut_N,8,Fri Jul 17 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"Quebecois and Canadian aren't mutually exclusive.  Just like Scottish and Canadian aren't mutually exclusive, or Cree and Canadian."
CanadaPolitics,3do9y3,CupOfCanada,7,Fri Jul 17 22:24:20 2015 UTC,"That's a million-dollar question, bud. I think that ultimately, it's a label people apply to themselves, and not one necessarily in conflict with being Canadian. I consider myself Quebecois first, but I still consider myself Canadian, and lots of folks feel the other way around, and some feel only Canadian, and some feel only Quebecois.  As an 'ethnic' term, or one referring to a 'nation,' it refers to the Francophone inhabitants of Quebec descended from the French settlers, who share a common culture developed from centuries of mostly agrarian life, monolithic Catholicism (whose values to a considerable extent still suffuse Quebec politics and society), and linguistic/cultural isolation as a French island in an English sea.   Various people have different ideas about how inclusive or exclusive the term should be. I personally think that Rene Levesque's dictum that ""est Quebecois qui veut l'etre"" is the healthiest way of thinking about it. I take great pride in my heritage, but I also think that people who come to Quebec and want to join in our common cultural life are more than welcome to do so."

CanadaPolitics,3do9y3,drhuge12,3,Fri Jul 17 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's pretty much default for most Francophones in Quebec (whether ethnically Quebecois or not) and quite a few Anglophones, as well.  Though I do think that people who exclusively identify as Quebecois might be more likely to be separatists. There's quite likely opinion polling on this question, give 'er a google if you're curious.  edit: some light googling has turned this somewhat interesting read up"
CanadaPolitics,3do9y3,business_bear,5,Fri Jul 17 22:37:34 2015 UTC,"It refers to a resident of Quebec, a Canadian province. Separatists will usually use it as an alternative to Canadian."

CanadaPolitics,3dnrw4,trollunit,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:12 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this piece. Governments absolutely go through phases with their relationship with the media, but the long-term cold war that's happened between the current PMO and the media is fairly unprecedented. Chretien loved the media, even after he was repeatedly and rightly held to account for a range of issues in his government. Mulroney and Trudeau variously oscillated between love and hate. This is not an inevitable trajectory.   Moreover, to say that all governments will eventually reach the current government's level of media isolation ignores the fact that's how the current government has always been; there was never a honeymoon phase."

CanadaPolitics,3dm379,Majromax,5,Fri Jul 17 12:36:46 2015 UTC,"As a second recommendation, I would suggest George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman series.   In 1857, author Thomas Hughes wrote Tom Brown's Schooldays, a fictional account of student life at the English public school Rugby in the late 1830s and 40s. One of the characters was a complete poltroon and bully named Harry Flashman who was eventually expelled.   Fraser took the Flashman character and wrote a series of novels based on his imagined life in the British Army after being expelled. The character is a bully, a coward and a womanizer - essentially the opposite of the stereotypical Victorian gentleman. The premise of the novels is that Flashman's papers were discovered in an attic in the late 1960s and that Fraser is the editor. The books are very funny.   Fraser was an academic historian, so the history he conveys is well documented - Fraser introduces elements of the unreliable narrator but since he is the editor, the novel has footnotes that highlight historical points of interest and places where Flashman appears to be mistaken. He wrote many other things, including the screenplay for the James Bond movie Octopussy."

CanadaPolitics,3dmr7d,bramathon3,6,Fri Jul 17 18:45:47 2015 UTC,"The debt-to-GDP is about the same now as it was in the last year of the PC government (1999).   Manitoba's economy has been doing very well since the NDP took over in 1999. Strong population and GDP growth (for Manitoba) and one of the strongest productivity growth rates in North America.  Between 1999 and 2008, due to a strong provincial and global economy,Manitoba ran large surpluses, while at the same time investing record levels of money into public services. Continued surpluses and a growing economy shrank the debt from 32% of GDP to a low of 21% in 2007 (that date me be off by a year or two). When the recession hit in 2008, unlike some provinces - Ontario - Manitoba did not cut spending when revenues dropped, but instead engaged in economic stimulus, particularly by investing in infrastructure. The result was Manitoba was in recession for only a short time (dubbed the Manitoba Miracle, by McClean's Magazine), however, this came at a cost of an $1 billion dollar deficit. The government has refused to slash services or infrastructure spending to cut the deficit, but has been able to bring it down to around $350 million since 2009, and says they can balance the budget by 2017-2018 (there is a provincial election in April 2016). Still, debt-to-GDP is lower (at 29%) than it was under the last days of the supposedly fiscally responsible PC government."

Those who say anyone can invest and see the returns must understand that when you are trying to keep afloat the last thing you can do is look at long term investing. You are looking at keeping food on the table and your head above water. At the end of these peoples lifetimes they are enormous burdens on the government as they can't just let their citizens starve and die. This must be addressed during their working careers. Not taxing at proper levels and having the social safety net and minimum wage levels we need to allow everyone to at least earn a living just causes more and more of these issues."

Just look at what most people eat, what they drink, and how much exercise they get.  If you're constantly eating fast food and processed food, if you're drinking coffee and pop instead of water, if you don't exercise... you're probably not going to be a healthy person in the long run.  But it's not just poor people who are unhealthy... you see it in everyone... rich, middle class, and the poor. There are correlations I suppose that make poor people somewhat more unhealthy, but it's not really an issue of not having enough money.   It can actually be much cheaper to live a healthy lifestyle. Going jogging or playing soccer in the park doesn't cost any money vs. going to see a movie. Drinking clean/filtered water is cheaper than any other drink. Cooking healthy food is a lot cheaper than going to McDonalds. Brushing your teeth with toothpaste costs practically nothing.   Then there's obviously things like smoking, alcohol, drugs (both prescription and illegal) which can all have negative effects on our health.  Anyways, this article is just more socialist propaganda trying to justify the redistribution of wealth. Why not write about the real reasons people are unhealthy?"

If Harper resigned before a new leader was chosen, the Conservatives would certainly appoint an interim leader who would serve as Prime Minister.  The only case where a third place leader could be Prime Minister is under a power-sharing agreement. A good example of this is what the second- and third-place party leaders in this year's Israeli election proposed - if they had formed government, the leader of the second party would've served as PM for a year, followed by a year with the third party's leader as PM (and more rotation until an election occurred)"

Her doctor is not prescribing her this medicine because of hospital policy. Children's Hospital is taking its cues from Health Canada. The common refrain from Health Minister Rona Ambrose is that medical marijuana has not been rigorously tested nor approved for treatment by Health Canada. Has Health Canada refused to take up that work for partisan or other ideological reasons? What work is being done to verify it as a medicine then? And if her doctor believes this is helping, why are politics stepping into the picture of individual patient health and why aren't people like Ambrose trying to do something about it?

CanadaPolitics,3diqo1,LondonPaddington,7,Thu Jul 16 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"Has Health Canada refused to take up that work for partisan or other ideological reasons?   Health Canada doesn't do any drug testing or clinical trials themselves. They set standards and approve studies conducted by third-parties (generally but not exclusively drug manufacturers). Until very recently, no third party has tried to put marijuana through the regulatory process as nobody had a vested interest in getting it approved - this is slowly changing though as relatively new government licensed medical marijuana providers now have an interest in expanding the market for medical marijuana.   The first Canadian clinical trial using marijuana was approved by Health Canada last month (evaluating the effectiveness of marijuana in the treatment of arthritis). I'm not sure Health Canada has ever had a serious application for a clinical trial of medical marijuana before that."
CanadaPolitics,3diqo1,Majromax,8,Thu Jul 16 19:32:18 2015 UTC,"Children's Hospital is taking its cues from Health Canada.    Is it?  This is a very specific claim, that the Children's Hospital's policy is being influenced by the Minister's ultimately political statements.  I'd be perfectly willing to believe this, but we haven't the slightest shred of supporting evidence from this article.  The hospital's policy does not seem to prohibit medical marijuana in general, even for children.  Instead, it refers to a lack of study on its efficacy with epilepsy, and this is a reasonable scientific point to make.  (Accurate? I don't know, I'm neither a medical doctor nor a biologist.)  Be careful about the language in the hospital's statement versus that of Health Canada and Ambrose.  Ambrose specifically refers to Health Canada approving marijuana as a medicine, but in addition to that the hospital says it has no information on any reputable studies or organizations recommending the use of cannabis for epilepsy.  On the face of it, it sounds as if this contested prescription would qualify if, say, a US university had undertaken such a study.  Even if we were to believe that the hospital is following clandestine marching orders, we don't have supporting correlational evidence.  When did the policy change?  Was that change around the same time that the government began making a fuss about medical marijuana?  Was this policy changed quickly, or after a long deliberative process?  We don't even have a direct statement from the non-prescribing doctor, who is currently on vacation.  I like a nefarious conspiracy as much as anyone else, but at the moment we don't have evidence for it -- certainly not enough to get out the pitchforks."

AHS says it will evaluate new medical research but for now is taking the lead from Health Canada   I don't consider that to be a conspiracy theory. Or actually really controversial that Children's Hospital or AHS would follow the lead of Health Canada. What is controversial is the position that the Conservative Party has taken on the use of medical marijuana.  Edit: I am not sure if AHS said 'taking the lead from Health Canada' directly or it was just the journalist making the connection.

In light of that, I can't see why the doctors would choose not to renew the child's prescription. The hospital's statement saying   Health Canada has not approved medical marijuana for the treatment of seizures in Canada, and AHS is unaware of any studies, data or recognized epilepsy organizations that recommend or endorse the use of medical marijuana in pediatric patients with epilepsy   is outright false, as the Health Canada website directly contradicts that.

As for the second part of their statement, that's a stretch - they'd be perfectly correct to say insufficient research exists, but that's not the same thing as no research.   Health Canada has opted to leave the decision to prescribe in the hands of individual doctors, which is appropriate enough in my view. Whether doctors have enough information available to them (or whether enough information even exists) to prescribe it in the same manner as other approved prescription medications is another story.

Ritalin, an amphetamine, has changed my life. I'm pretty good in biology. I haven't finished high school yet but I've worked on two papers that have been published (contributor on the first one and lead author on the second), and currently, I'm working on my third. I don't mean to brag but it can certainly be said that I know my way around biology, right? Well not according to my high school last year; I got an score of 89% two years ago, a B in my school.  It's not a bad mark per-se but if I continued to get marks like that I probably wouldn't have a shot at any 'elite' university, especially if I got a score like that on my SATs (which I would have). Imaginably, I also had weak marks in other subjects, especially ones that didn't interest me much.  Now with ritalin, I'm able to succeed academically in all my subjects. I was originally diagnosed with ADHD when I was around 10 but my parents decided to not give me drugs, a horrendously wrong decision in my opinion. If I had continued to be off of medication, none of my dreams would really be achievable. Ritalin has helped me so so so much. I honestly don't know were I'd be without it."

So well i think thats great youve found use for them i would really recommend using them only when you really need them and in moderation unless you want to start having heart palpitations down the road.

They frequently find out horrible side effects years or decades down the road. Scientists are actually pretty bad at determining all side effects and companies have been sued as a result.  One drug that has shown very little side effects over generations is MM, the sampling size is pretty large.

The side effects of this medication can be devastating.  I watched my mother take this medication for a couple years. At the beginning her voice started slurring and she developed some memory problems. We were told that it was due to the seizures that she was still having. Her dosage was increased and she started falling and was confused often. We were told it was due to the seizures that she was still having and her dosage was increased. As time went on, we stopped being able to understand what she was saying most of the time, she sounded like a baby babbling. Which was somewhat fitting as she stopped being able to walk unless someone was holding her (she had no balance). She stopped being able to feed herself and my father had to feed her; she wouldn't take food from anyone other than my father; we had to be careful on what we feed her as she couldn't swallow properly and she aspirated some foods (like rice), which in turn resulted in her developing pneumonia frequently (due to aspirated foods and saliva). Her memory was all but gone; on days that she could talk, she often called me by my sisters name (who hadn't lived at home in years) and would  ask where our dog was (who had died 10 years before). In the last couple months on the medication, she mostly spent her time sleeping, which was a relief for her, my father and myself (my siblings didn't live at home and didn't know the extent of what was happening with her). In addition to the cognitive issues, her liver function was not normal as a result of the medication.   We were told that all this was due to her seizures. The over 100 seizures a day that she continued having the entire time that she was on the medication. My mother was in her late 30's when she started taking this medication and was on it for about 3ish years. In that time she aged about 20 years. I watched my grandmother go through Alzheimer's in her 80's and at her worst, she was still better than my mother during those two years.   She has stopped the medication now and has been on dozens of other anti-seizure medications over the last 15 or so years since, but she still suffers some effects. Her liver function is still not normal, she still has issues with memories. The medication was on up to a year ago still made her loose balance, it still caused her to sleep sometimes 16+hours a day, it still caused slurred speech, some days she would still be confused and ask for our dead dog (now the one that died 10 years ago). And she still had 100+ seizures a day which resulted in over a 15 concussions in one year alone. In fact, one sleep study that she did recorded 127 seizures over one night alone.  Two years ago my father looked into marijuana after hearing how it helped someone else. He did a lot of research, talked to his family doctor, my mother's family doctor, two neurologists and a psychiatrist to get their opinions and they all said they didn't think it would work. He pushed forward and it convinced my mother that she should try it. They couldn't get a prescription so they did research on which strain was the best and talked to a drug dealer in my home-town and got him to bring some in and she started using. She has been using marijuana for medicinal purposes for just over a year now. She stopped having seizures about a month after she started using and she is now working on weaning herself of the medications that were prescribed.   Both of my parents were completely anti-drugs before this. Even five years ago, if you had of ask any of my family if my mother would ever use marijuana we would have laughed at you. This is a women that hasn't so much as had a drop of wine or a cigarette in her life. But she has her life back now. She is happier and healthier now than I have EVER seen her and it is thanks to marijuana. But she still has been unable to get a prescription so she risks going to jail because of this."

In terms of young adults between 17 and 21, there is a big grey zone and it's debatable when it's unacceptable to decide for them (not going to touch that) but even older than 21?

Yeah I'm sure there will still be minors who gain access to it, but far far less under a regulatory system. The black market simply wont be able to make a profit off underage consumers, and without a large consumer base it will be harder for them to push the more dangerous drugs on the public.  Honestly 21 just seems right. I understand the argument for drinking and smoking, but this is something that was illegal for 70+ years and it will be easier for the public to adapt and accept if it's 21+.  The brain stops developing somewhere between 20-25, meaning the damage it can cause to young minds wont be an issue to those who are legally allowed to smoke it. I honestly think 18-19 is too young for our kids to be drinking too, but fighting that now would be an uphill battle that wouldn't gain enough support.   On top of that, drinking and smoking really shouldn't be mixed, which a lot of stoners have already figured out.

The overhead cost of growing marijuana is pretty low. I know people who grow plants in their basement on a shelf with a $100 light. It won't be the highest quality stuff out there, but it's cheap and easily accessible. No doubt there will be a decrease, but high school kids are a large consumer base and there is definitely still money to be made there, even if it's just some 11th grader growing it in his closet.   I do think making it legal will make it harder for kids to get it, but still nowhere near impossible. Even then, how many high school kids have a friend that's 19 or 21? Or a sibling? A parent that doesn't care if their kids smoke? All you need is a dozen kids who know somebody that's legal to buy weed and they can provide the rest of the school.   Alcohol has the other issue of being harder to hide. You can't keep a 24 pack in your backpack or locker, somebody will notice, it makes sound, takes lots of space, etc. Weed, though? You can wrap a gram of weed in saran wrap or tinfoil and it's the size of a coin.

We know it affects the development of adolescent brains, but it's not fully understood what it does.

That's just the common ones.  I have seen my intelligent loving husband go from an outgoing young man, to a complete recluse, to a rage-filled psycho, to a zombie that could only stare at walls until bedtime, to someone who was suicidal and cried all the time, and now he has chronic insomnia, no appetite, short-term memory problems, myoclonic jerks, and very severe anxiety. And his neurologist's answer to everything is stacking more medication (with more side effects) on top of this crap already. And none of the meds he's tried have stopped his complex partials, just his tonic clonics. The only thing that keeps him feeling human is his medical cannabis, it's also the only thing keeps his complex partials at bay.  He has to live his life one day at a time because he could wake up and just feel off, and not be able to do much more than stay in bed for that day with no warning. He can't hold down a job because he's a liability who randomly has to take sick days without warning, he can't drive a car because he's a liability, he can't have a beer, or go out with friends hiking. If it weren't for me and our family, he'd be completely isolated, and many epileptics are because a lot of SOs don't stick around for long-term illness and disabilities.  I know it's not your fault that you're ignorant of the realities of living with epilepsy and the extreme challenges the medications' side effects present in day to day life for epileptics, and I apologize if I'm coming off a bit strong. But this is something I, clearly, have a lot of experience with and feel very strongly about.  Cannabis saves lives, it's why the Charlotte's Web strain exists. It's why Sanjay Gupta changed his position on medical cannabis after years of defending the FDA's classification of it.

If only 20% of people vote you can't really say that as easily. And while it's easy to blame our low turnout on voter apathy/the uninformed/etc., at the end of the day we have one of the few systems in the world where the majority of votes go towards electing nobody, and as such there is very little incentive to vote, especially in non-competitive ridings and especially after they abolished the per vote subsidy."

She doesn't vote, and will tell anyone that tries to mention politics to fuck off. She has zero opinion about the political system. Not in a negative or positive sense, just doesn't care in general. Democracy could collapse entirely tomorrow, and transform into a dictatorship, and she would not care. Actually, she would probably be happy, because she hates when people pressure her to vote.

If you are satisfied, and have been all your life, then you aren't going to know about parties that could threaten to change how things are.

CanadaPolitics,3diq75,Dan4t,9,Fri Jul 17 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the concept of democratic legitimacy. We have already in the past 4 years had a politician who only commands the confidence of about 24% of eligible voters act as if a majority of Canadians has given him a mandate to make all kinds of changes to the very fabric of this country and its democracy (I did some number crunching, based on this article there were about 14,700,000 voters total in 2011 representing about 61.4% of eligible voters, and a little cross-multiplication led me to a total pool of 23,941,368 voters, and since Harper won with 39.6% of the vote, or 5,821,200 of 14,700,000, that's 24.3% of the total eligible voters).  Aaaaaaanyway, that's me saying that acting like only your party's view matters with only 24.3% of eligible voters supporting you is kind of messed up already. Can you imagine if vote suppression and other tools dropped voter turnout even further? I ran some more numbers, and with only 50% of people voting, a 39.6% majority victory would actually translate to less than 20% of eligible voters! That means that 1 in 5 adults actually voted for the guy, and so up to 4 in 5 adults don't necessarily agree with his policies, and yet he's fully 100% in charge, barely any fetters on his ability to make decisions about how we are all governed.   Drop it down to 40% turnout, and we're talking 15.8% support!!  Drop it down to 20%, and our majority Prime Minister only needs to secure about 7.9% of the eligible voters!!!  Democratic legitimacy flows from the idea that those who lead us won a free and fair election that saw a plurality or even majority of the population vote for them. Low voter turnout undermines that, because it suggests among other things that a) there's a problem with the elections, maybe they're not very free or fair, or b) a lot of people feel that none of the parties represents them, or c) people don't feel that the Government will represent them no matter who wins.   When a party is specifically engaged in voter suppression and other electoral fraud, as the Conservatives (or their staff on the suppression side if you disagree with the judges in Sona's case who found that he was likely a fall guy for a larger conspiracy - the CPC did plead guilty to electoral fraud) have found to be in every election since 2006, that's even worse, because it seems like they want to mess with the fairness of the elections and therefore win without democratic legitimacy. That's the kind of thing that leads to extreme rhetoric where people liken Harper's Government to an authoritarian one, etc. Because a healthy democracy flows from the people voting for the candidate that best appeals to them, not the one who was best at cheating and keeping those they don't like away from the polls."

Secondly, as much as I dislike the current Conservative party I do not know if he has seriously ""changed the very fabric of this country and its democracy.""  A much more important aspect of democracy is that the voting public can turn around and vote for someone else the next election.  While 24% may theoretically be able to make a huge shift, they still cannot change the constitution etc. and if they truly act horribly either the next election sees a massive increase in turnout to throw them out - or it is just more proof that the masses are unaware/uncaring about politics (assuming they actually performed horribly).  Lastly, I am still as I said very supportive of electoral reform, ideally resulting in less majority's that largely eliminates the scary picture you are painting without any reference to turnout.    Why is a 80% turnout when the majority of them are influenced by low-information campaigns so much more legitimate than 30% of educated voters?"

A much more important aspect of democracy is that the voting public can turn around and vote for someone else the next election   It depends, many people are worried that all the advantages he's given himself with the recent Fair Elections Act, political financing, Government advertising, Government spending, etc will not result in as free or fair an election as a country like Canada should have.

CanadaPolitics,3diq75,Iustis,2,Thu Jul 16 23:40:47 2015 UTC,"It is a mistake to treat voting as an individual right. It is collective.  Say I am able to vote, so my individual right is not impinged: yet I am a black man, and all of the other black men in my riding are prevented from voting. Does this only impair their individual rights, or does it impair mine also? I think the latter.  I am only using this example to clarify the point, not suggesting the right belongs to particular groups. Nor am I suggesting that my democratic rights are only shared with those who are likely to agree with me.  If democracy means government by the people or their representatives, then it belongs to the people together. If a large proportion of us do not participate because we are discouraged (e.g. with voter suppression tactics) or believe (often correctly) that our vote makes no difference, then we all lose democracy, regardless of whether individually we might vote.  You might think that my influence is increased if I vote while others abstain. Certainly it does, but I do not believe that democracy is simply a matter of exercising power. Just as our system of criminal law is rooted in the idea that a crime against one is a crime against all, the disenfranchisement of one is also the disenfranchisement of all, regardless of whether he be disenfranchised deliberately by force or incidentally by a flawed system. I might not agree with the political choice that one makes, but this is not the point: as a citizen of a democratic country, my right is to be governed democratically, not to get my own way.  Edit: I should also agree with insanity_irt_reality on the importance of legitimacy. When more voters participate in an election, the legitimacy of the elected government is increased, regardless of whether those voters voted for the outcome. A vote for any party gives a mandate to whichever party wins. I may not agree with all decisions a particular government makes, but most of what it does is all our interests. Except in extreme cases (I'm tempted to invoke Godwin), that we are governed effectively is more important than that we are governed exactly as we would like. Every vote is a vote for peace, order and good government. Similarly, I think that every non-vote should be taken seriously as a criticism of the legitimacy of our system."

I think that's reasonable, though I think much of what appears to be apathy is in actually resignation. I always vote, but each time I regret it. I invest in the process, yet every time I am reminded that my action was meaningless and ineffectual. I regret that I wasted passion on voting that could productively have been invested in meaningful political action. Someone I know tells me she is surrounded by friends who hate the government, yet no matter how hard she argues they refuse to vote.  The apathetic will always be with us. But when participation is this low, when it declines as much as it has over the years, there must be something more fundamental at work.  In any case, the passage I have a problem with is the following:   Democracy is about the right to express your dissatisfaction and influence the body that governs you   This takes voting as an individual right. I don't think it is. As an individual independent action, voting really is meaningless. We can only take effective political action in concert with others: only then does the formality of voting matter. It is like dropping the letter to an MP in the mailbox: you have to do it, but the meaningful part was writing the letter; if you didn't do that, mailing the envelope is a useless gesture. So I agree that an unengaged vote is worthless. But I think many people are engaged at some level, yet they do not vote."
CanadaPolitics,3diq75,Tlavi,2,Fri Jul 17 00:09:13 2015 UTC,"Ideals aside, there is a couple very practical problems with low voter turnout. The first is that low voter turnout is never uniform. When students, young people, minorities and others low in low numbers, their interests are in turn not well-represented. In a time where the older generation is in a demographic boom, holds the vast majority of wealth and young people vote less than ever, this seriously skews the priorities of the government.   Secondly, low voter turnout strongly incentives 'turnout politics'. This mean rather than running on broadly appealing platforms, politicians push wedge issues and try to get the base fired up. I would argue that this plays a major role in the kind of rhetoric and polarization we see today - for example calling Trudeau a terrorist isn't something that most Canadians condone or believe, but the CPC doesn't care, because the goal is motivate turnout among loyal partisans. Parties are also getting extremely sophisticated with this kind of targeting. They have enormous databases of information about individual voters, and use that data to make highly calculated decisions. This definitely results in a style of campaign that revolves around highly targeted policies, rather than broadly appealing ones.  While I respect the right of people not to vote, I think this low turnout will continue to have a negative effect on our politics and it is in the public interest to increase it."

I don't have the figures on hand (yes, I see the irony here) but I've read a number of the research projects into voter turn out and there is no clear link between turn out and electoral system. There is minor gains at best.   The reality of voter turnout is that it's declining across the liberal democratic countries. This is true across all electoral and governing systems. Electoral reform may be a small part in increasing turnout but it certainly is not a cure in and of itself."

Take for instance a hypothetical election where Conservatives / Liberals / NDP all score 25% of the vote, the Green party 15%, the block 9% and Independents 1%.   How would we decide which party controls which riding? Would we apply those percentages to the number of seats in each province? What would that mean for a province like PEI with 4 seats?   Or would they do it by the voter turn out in each province overall? For example, 20% of people in Alberta vote for the Liberal Party so they get 20% of the available seats from Alberta in Ottawa?   In both situations the question remains of who would get to represent each riding. If 7 NDP candidates run for election in New Brunswick, and the NDP gets 1/7th the vote, who gets to sit in the seat? Would that be a party decision? How would they decide which riding got represented by the NDP?   TL/DR: How will they select/assign seats in a new proportional representation system?"

CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,Der_Krankenwagen,36,Fri Jul 17 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"*sigh*.  This article goes way overboard with vitriol about ""list MPs.""    In other words, the NDP would like to appoint as MPs unelected (or unelectable) political insiders that are not accountable to voters or representative of any particular community.     This begs the question that existing candidates are effectively representatives of a community.  We've all heard arguments about ""parachute candidates,"" and these would seem to be inevitable in any FPTP system that admits the existence of ""safe seats.""  If anything, MMP would encourage better selection of candidates for the local mandate, since winning a riding's vote by 80% versus 50% would translate to more party-list votes (provided voters don't split their ticket).    MMP’s new class of ‘list MPs’ is also likely to be an upper class. By giving parties more control of the composition of the Commons, the House can be stacked with social, economic, and urban elites in a far more shameless and irreproachable manner than ever before.    ... just how many current MPs are not from the social and economic elite?  And if anything, the NDP caucus happens to be the least elite because of the ""orange crush"" electing a number of young first-time candidates who haven't aged into elite status yet.  (Although I suspect this is more historical accident than anything else.)  Besides, what incentive would a party have to stack their list with elites just because?  Party lists are also excellent vehicles for ensuring that there is regional, ethnic, and economic representation, since a party could still elect some MPs from (say) Northern BC despite being shut out of direct mandates in the area.  We've also entirely skipped over discussion of how a party chooses its list MPs.  The article is taking a very negative interpretation that they would be appointed at the whim of party brass.  This would be a conceivable possibility, but equally likely would be for a party to select its list via a more democratic internal process.    To accommodate MMP’s list MPs, either the size of the House or the size of ridings has to be increased. Both options water down the influence of local representatives and the interests they bring forward to debate.    Yep.  Those high-powered, gods-amongst-mortals, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Ottawa"" local MPs.  If we had these mythical highly representative local MPs, we wouldn't be talking about electoral reform.  Instead, a backbencher's most useful role on the floor of the Commons is as a trained circus seal, barking and voting as the leader tells them to.  If our MPs are reduced to that, then we may as well make sure that the colour of their uniforms matches the public vote as closely as possible.    MMP is lauded for giving voice to smaller parties that amass enough nationwide support to seat a few list MPs, but this outcome also destabilizes legislatures by placing the balance of power in the hands of fringe parties.    ... or it could foster more unity governments.  The current German government is a grand coalition between the right-ish CDU/CSU and the left-ish SPD.  ""Minority parties are destabilizing"" presumes that larger parties are unable to find common ground.  This is nonsense even in Canada, where we successfully had minority governments from 2004 until 2011 that passed supply on a regular basis.    A winning party could form an American-style cabinet entirely from its list MPs, forsaking the caucus elected by voters. This short-circuits a crucial feedback mechanism between the public and their ministers, and divorces the legislature from the executive in a manner foreign to our Parliamentary tradition.    The author needs to read up on Parliamentary tradition.  There is no requirement that Cabinet ministers even be elected MPs, let alone represent a constituency.  Besides, I do not think it necessarily advantageous that a cabinet minister holds a direct mandate from a single riding.  Why should the residents of Mytown-by-the-Lake have greater access to the Minister of Candy by virtue of representation, when the portfolio is necessarily of national (or at least regional) importance?    Complicating the method of election alone shakes voter faith in the system.    [Citation Needed].  Other nations seem more than capable of having legitimate elections with a two-choice MMP system.  Are Canadian voters uniquely simpletons?    There is little benefit added to our politics by injecting a hoard of seat-warming spear-carriers to the House of Commons, ready to vote on command and recite vacuous talking points from their leader’s office.    ... presented without other comment.    If the objective of reforms is to ensure that everyone’s ballot ‘counts’, ranked or preferential balloting is a far superior method for arriving at local agreement on a victor while maintaining the simplicity, accountability, and mapping of FPTP.     Not really.  Ranked balloting allows local compromise on a second-choice, but it does not guarantee proportionality.  Besides, this does almost as much to ""complicate the method of election"" as does MMP.  MMP and other proportionality-seeking methods at their core start with the premise that the local neighbourhood may not be the most appropriate basis of representation.  The community may have been the proper basis in 1867 with little in the way of national media, but I do not feel it makes the most sense nearly a hundred and fifty years later.  (Bonus edit):    The Ontario government appears to agree.    That refers to ranked balloting for municipal elections, which are nonpartisan.  There is no conceivable way of implementing MMP for Toronto."
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,Majromax,21,Fri Jul 17 15:23:10 2015 UTC,"Man, this is just awful and patently dishonest, but let me back that up:  The thrust of the authors argument is that the list candidates would be   MPs unelected (or unelectable) political insiders that are not accountable to voters or representative of any particular community.   But in the very same motion that he links to in the commons, both Scott and Crowder talk about the Law Commission of Canada's report (Voting Counts) which explicitly recommended   Within the context of a mixed member proportional system, Parliament should adopt a flexible list system that provides voters with the option of either endorsing the party “slate” or “ticket,” or of indicating a preference for a candidate within the list.   The Law Commission's report has a nice little sample ballot and an explanation of how this would work, but the quick 'n' dirty is that we cast two ballots on election day.  The first ballot is for your regional representative, FPTP style, and these regional reps make up 2/3 of the house, which will require larger ridings (150kish vs. 100kish at present) and which he addresses and I will shortly.  Your second ballot is this flexible list ballot, where you can either endorse the party's list with one simple check or you can select your own preferred candidate from the party's list candidates, if a selected candidate gets more than 8% of the vote they override the party order.  The assertion that parties would fill their list with unelectable bagmen and hacks is absurd, what party would want to walk into an election with a pile of dead weight on their ballot.  And I also think it would be safe to assume that parties would internalize their list elections, which is to say that party members would vote at conventions for their lists rather than simply have them appointed by executive council.  And lastly, the lists in the proposed system are all provincial to start with, so at least there's some tie to a region for the list candidates, B.C. will have a list, Sask'll have a list, etc.  I think I've demonstrated the childish absurdity of this statement   The proposed system surrenders both electoral choice and Parliamentary participation to party brass, giving rise to outcomes that might attract constitutional scrutiny.   Now   To accommodate MMP’s list MPs, either the size of the House or the size of ridings has to be increased. Both options water down the influence of local representatives and the interests they bring forward to debate.   The system on the table is the latter, larger ridings, and while this invariably means less acute representation I think it's well worth it for the additional proportionality.   MMP is lauded for giving voice to smaller parties that amass enough nationwide support to seat a few list MPs, but this outcome also destabilizes legislatures by placing the balance of power in the hands of fringe parties.   I'd like to see an example where a party with two or three seats hijacked a governments agenda.  I find it hard to believe that giving a voice to the Greens, Libertarians, CAP, and CHP would leave us beholden to their whims.   A winning party could form an American-style cabinet entirely from its list MPs, forsaking the caucus elected by voters. This short-circuits a crucial feedback mechanism between the public and their ministers, and divorces the legislature from the executive in a manner foreign to our Parliamentary tradition.   Boy, they sure could, but who the fuck would do that?  Parties aren't stupid, they don't deliberately throw away elections, could you imagine the press if a party selected even half their cabinet from list MPs that make up 1/3 of the house?  I mean Harper could've also appointed his whole cabinet from the Senate, but then he'd be a fucking idiot and not the PM.   More crucially, the complexity of MMP threatens the electoral enterprise of our free and democratic society by breaking the incentivizing links of accountability and representation between MPs and ridings.   It's not complex, read the Law Commission's report, it's nothing near the complexity of BC-STV for instance, I think most Canadians are grown up enough to grasp this system in about 5 minutes.   At the same time, MMP fuels a culture of hyper-partisan follow-the-leader politics. It fixates on rectifying the quantities of our representatives but does so at the expense of the quality of their office.  There is little benefit added to our politics by injecting a hoard of seat-warming spear-carriers to the House of Commons, ready to vote on command and recite vacuous talking points from their leader’s office. This is the exact sort of pull-string partisanship and rigid discipline that has cast a shadow on Parliament.   This guy.  I like that he states that it'll a create a terrible culture just like the one we have, classic.  But further to that this is another example of his closed list straw man, which probably wouldn't be this bad but isn't even on the table.   and voters in British Columbia, who have taken a pass on a new electoral system twice.   Wow, taken a pass on a system that wasn't MMPR, and further to that we took a pass with 57% of voters in favour of BC-STV the first time around, it's just that it had a 60% threshold.  I'll let the Commission's report point out why they chose MMP over ranked or preferential balloting.   While both Opposition parties are right to start a conversation on democratic reform, the NDP is wrong to prescribe a self-serving remedy with such sparse detail on its effects. Canadians deserve a more particularized discussion of any bid to retool their most basic, legitimizing interface with government machinery. Anything less is a coup of our Commons, and Mr. Mulcair’s NDP has no mandate to impose such a radical transformation.   Preferential balloting is ""self-serving"" to the Liberals, it doesn't get much more particularized than the Law Commission's report, and Mulcair's NDP will have exactly that mandate if they win the next election having been as open to their designs as the commentator just centered his whole article upon.  This article has the intellectual validity of my questioning the Conservatives for endorsing the American presidential system because they support FPTP, not all MMP systems are the same.  tl;dr:  Dude paints a straw man MMP system and everyone should read Voting Counts including the author."
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,_Ogopogo_,7,Fri Jul 17 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"In other words, the NDP would like to appoint as MPs unelected (or unelectable) political insiders that are not accountable to voters or representative of any particular community.   Last I heard, the NDP want open lists. Which means that if there's a list MP you don't like, you can, in fact, vote against them. In a way, they're more accountable than traditional MP's, because more people can vote against them.  Personally, I would prefer the best loser approach, because I think open lists make the ballot too complicated. Open lists are good enough to address the unaccountable complaint, though."
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,QuizzicalButthead,7,Fri Jul 17 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"1) Most systems of MMP still tie MPs elected from lists to regions, they're just larger regions than the present riding system.   2) MMP would actually have the effect of more focus upon who each party nominates. The entire list (or at least the top half) would be severely scrutinized, in a way that isn't currently done with MPs in our current system. Local resources are often too limited for an extensive search into an MPs background, but with nationwide resources we would end up with a better understanding of the people running for each party.   3) I fail to understand how making parliament more similar to the popular vote is less democratic? His case it pretty weak here. Just look at the Greens! How can you argue it would be less democratic to ensure that the consistent 5% or so of Canadians who vote Green Party would be represented by 5% of the MPs in the house?  Edit: Also, how does the list system limit electoral choice? If you don't like the list, vote elsewhere. This would have the happy effect of allowing MORE access to remote communities, since they would now be less limited by the small number of large rural ridings in each area."
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,origamitiger,8,Fri Jul 17 15:02:06 2015 UTC,"I fail to understand how making parliament more similar to the popular vote is less democratic?   The argument there is that a key part of democracy is accountability. A system is more democratic when MPs are directly accountable to voters. Under MMP, the supplemental MPs aren't directly elected; instead, they're usually chosen from a list that's compiled by the party, so those MPs are only accountable to a party leader.  Put it otherwise: If we applied MMP to the 2011 election results, every Conservative and NDP MP would have to be re-elected by his/her constituents, while many Liberal and most Bloc MPs could get re-elected by virtue of getting onto the party list and maintaining the party's vote share"
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,amnesiajune,7,Fri Jul 17 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"A system is more democratic when MPs are directly accountable to voters.   Then our system is already unaccountable.  Most major legislation is drafted by Cabinet, modified little if any by debate and committee, and passed along party lines.  Because election campaigns are national, there is no benefit to a ""rogue"" MP from a party taking a strong, meaningful stand.  At best, they can win local re-election by hurting their chosen party, which makes it more likely that their other preferred policies fail.  Canadians may vote for an individual MP, but they ultimately elect whole governments.  A vote for a candidate is a vote for the whole platform of that candidate's party."
CanadaPolitics,3dmlpw,Majromax,6,Fri Jul 17 15:28:07 2015 UTC,"Our system is unaccountable because voters choose not to hold politicians to account. Every MP can currently be replaced by another party's candidate or by an independent if they don't meet their constituents' expectations. MMP changes that - many representatives can no longer be held to account by their constituents, because they don't have any - whether or not they come back in the next Parliament is the party leader's decision, not a riding's decision. I still support PR (not MMP), but that's a huge drawback to any system that uses party lists"

Not all MPs are created equal.  Suppose I don't care for regulations being promulgated by the Minister of the Environment.  How am I supposed to hold the Minister to account, if she does not happen to be my local MP?  My only choice is to not vote for the incumbent government at the next election, but that choice is no different than the one I would have under MMP.  Government power is by design centralized in Cabinet, which in turn is appointed by the leader of the governing party.  As long as that division persists, elections need to hold the Executive to account moreso than the Legislature.  Your accountability argument would be stronger under the US Congressional system, where ostensibly all legislators are indeed equal in power and party discipline is a good bit weaker."

The issue here is whether you see that as a problem or a feature. If you see it as a problem, party lists aren't a solution - they're the equivalent of fighting fire with gasoline.

You elect a different MP who would vote against those regulations.   There's a reason I said regulation.  Regulations issued by Order-in-Council are not subject to Parliamentary debate or vote, so my local MP would have no say in the matter beyond voting confidence in the government as a whole.  If our ""accountability"" for the executive exists solely in terms of confidence, then proportional Parliamentary representation is paramount to that accountability, even if it comes at the expense of local representation.   If you see it as a problem, party lists aren't a solution - they're the equivalent of fighting fire with gasoline.    I see it more as the status quo.  Were I dictator of the electoral system I'd likely go with STV because of fairness to independent candidates, but I consider MMP to be an improvement over all single-seat (that is, non-proportional) voting systems."

Even if a party leader places them on a list, there still has to be enough votes for that particular party in order to get them back into Parliament.  The difference between this and the existing system is that MPs no longer need significant support within the boundaries of a relatively small district in order to be in Parliament. I personally see this as a good thing, because I think the views of (say) a Conservative supporter in downtown Montreal are better represented by a Conservative MP from Ontario than an NDP MP from the same city, but under the current electoral system, that NDP MP is their representation in Parliament."

When you look at the 2011 turnout numbers for New Zealand and Canada, we've both seen similar drops in turnout of 8.5 percentage points, despite New Zealand adopting MMP.  Again, it's not as simple as ""same turnout decline = no effect on turnout"", but we won't magically get a giant leap in voter turnout because of MMP"

For voter turnout, obviously compulsory voting is far more effective.   But for representative democracy, MMP is far more effective than FPTP. It encourages cooperation, consensus, negotiation and teamwork to solve a nation's problems. Germany's grand coalition is a great example. That's a far better system than the type of ""one man rule"" we've seen, especially in these last 4 years. Look where that's gotten us. The only G7 country in recession.   I know that if you like an antiquated system like FPTP (not personal, it's a knock on the system) which has long ago reached its best by date (imo), and if I like MMP, we can argue about it until the cows come home.

If nobody votes for the Liberals, none of the guys on their party list will make it into Parliament.  I see this as an advantage - in FPTP, MPs frequently fail to represent the interests of those that didn't vote for them in their geographical region. In a proportional system, these voters - who would otherwise be wasting their votes - now have representation through a list MP.

A winning party could form an American-style cabinet entirely from its list MPs, forsaking the caucus elected by voters.    List MPs are also elected by voters. They're just not elected by voters within the boundaries of an electoral district.   Accordingly, their federal cousins’ imposition of this reform is without precedent.    Putting AV/IRV in place is also sort of against precedent, in that while BC and Manitoba switched to this system in the past, they switched back to FPTP after a few elections.  And if you're looking for overseas precedents, the majority of democracies nowadays use proportional systems.   This is a commendable objective – the trouble is that MMP is the wrong vehicle for achieving it.   OK, so the author thinks proportional representation is commendable.

This has been a big problem in Saskatchewan specifically. We can't move grain fast enough. As a result we have been unable to sell grain to countries that normally buy from us."
CanadaPolitics,3dk2v2,PopeSaintHilarius,3,Fri Jul 17 04:15:36 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a massive PR campaign that hammers home the point that pipelines are, by far, the safest method to transport resources.   But that's partially missing the point.  Building these 4 new bitumen pipelines is expected to enable an additional 3 million barrels/day of oil sands production, so that the oil sands can expand from ~2 million barrels a day to 5.2 million barrels a day by 2030, according to the Canadian Petroleum Producers Association.  Many people (including myself) don't think it's a great idea to increase oil sands production by ~160% by 2030, when our country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030, as our contribution on the issue of climate change.  Given what we already know about climate change, embarking on a massive expansion of fossil fuel production seems to me like the completely wrong direction to go, at this point in history.  I hope to see us maintain current levels of production, and then gradually reduce production as we wean ourselves off fossil fuels.  For that path, none of these new bitumen pipelines are necessary."
CanadaPolitics,3dk2v2,adaminc,6,Fri Jul 17 05:01:31 2015 UTC,So what we need to do is reduce emissions used to mine and process that oil.   The GHG issue with the oil sands is how much natural gas they burn to process the oil. Supposedly they are working on getting some micro-nuclear reactors up there. That will reduce the GHGs of the place significantly.  Maybe even add-in more electric vehicles.

Does this look like fossil fuel consumption is declining? https://www.iea.org/oilmarketreport/omrpublic/  If the global economy doesn't buy oil from Canada, they will buy it somewhere else, but it will get consumed."

They estimate that by 2035 oil will start declining in the global energy mix, by 2050 it will be lower than it is now.  They also over predicted 2014's demand by 22%, so there is evidence to suggest they have absolutely no idea what is going to happen 2 quarters from now. Their ability to predict the next 2 years of oil demand is highly suspect."

CanadaPolitics,3dk2v2,drhuge12,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:38:18 2015 UTC,"If we don't produce oil in Canada will just purchase oil from elsewhere. Given that 80% of the emissions from a barrel of oil are created after you put it in your gas tank it's not going to do very much for emissions.  I'm not saying it won't do anything, taking a barrel of Oil Sands oil from extraction to consumption produces about 9% more emissions. Instead of trtibg to throttle Oil Sands growth (and the benefits that go with it) we need to incentivize technology growth to bring that number down. In my mind the best way to do that I'd through a carbon tax (preferably along with a reduction in business taxes) as it makes reductions in GHG emissions profitable."
CanadaPolitics,3dk2v2,KingCreole8,3,Fri Jul 17 16:49:42 2015 UTC,"They don't need to, all they need to do is state that they want to ship their oil to the coast for export.

Mr. Layton has acknowledged that when the cops, looking for underage Asian hookers, returned to the Velvet Touch parlour in the city's downtown Chinatown on Jan. 9, 1996 - their first visit was two weeks earlier and then they apparently charged a man with keeping a common bawdy house - he was indeed there.   Given that the Sun reproduced pages from contemporaneous notes made by one of the officers, including Mr. Layton's name, birth date and address, he had little choice but to make the admission.  But Mr. Layton, Ms. Chow - both then Metro Toronto councillors - and NDP lawyer Brian Iler all painted his visit there as an entirely innocent excursion.  The NDP leader said he simply went for a massage and had no idea the place was suspect; Ms. Chow noted that her husband exercises regularly, was and is in great shape and just needed a massage, and Mr. Iler said in a written statement that Mr. Layton ""had no knowledge whatsoever that the therapist's location may have been used for illicit purposes.""  A rather richer picture was provided by the officer's reproduced notes and an interview with the Sun: Mr. Layton, ostensibly there for a shiatsu massage (which traditionally doesn't require the removal of any clothing, let alone all of it) was lying naked on a bed; the female ""therapist"" dumped wet Kleenex into a garbage can upon the arrival of the police, and when Mr. Layton was asked if he'd received a sexual service and replied that he was there for shiatsu and one of the officers asked why, then, he had all his clothes off, he had no reply.  and   it still isn't actually that important at all compared to election fraud.   I'm sorry but a self proclaimed feminist being caught naked in a house of ill repute that was utilizing underage girls to perform sexual services when as a councillor he advocated a ban on touching during lap dancing is massively hypocritical.

Why are bloggers held to a higher standard of journalism than mainstream media, when it is the mainstream media that has a much easier time ignoring valid criticism, and succeeding in the face of it? Blogs don't have monied interests to power them through regular the controversy that Canada's media involves itself in.  The Star makes up stories.  It is known that journalism at The Globe and Mail is severely curtailed, if it even persists. Their editorial staff is told what to print and who to endorse by their ownership. The Globe also continues to employ and publish a known plagiarist. Postmedia sells tabloids along side it's more serious offerings, but the line between them continues to blur.

The Reform/PC split, which we associated with Canada's divided right-wing, was an accident of the 90s.  The fringe party of 1988 gained support largely because of the utter collapse of the Progressive Conservatives for the 1993 election.  That division was not a ""natural"" state of things, remedied by a revelation of wisdom.  At best you could argue that the Social Credit Party of Canada was a ""right-ish"" party (kinda, sorta, but not economically), but that party last did better than fourth place in the 1963 election.  If anything, Canada has always had two political axes.  The first axis is our commonly-understood left/right split on the economic file, which this article addresses.

In the recent Ontario election, the PCs and Liberals were strongly against corporate tax increases.    Raising corporate taxes can indeed be a vote-getter, but I think it does so more on a populism axis rather than necessarily a progressive/conservative axis.  Corporate tax hikes are rhetorically popular because they give the impression that the public revenue will increase while ""someone else"" will pay.  The economic reality is more complicated, but tax-incidence and adaptation arguments are in my experience flat-out rejected by the more strident proponents of corporate tax hikes.   Cutting corporate taxes has been a major policy iniative and election issue of the federal Conservatives.   True, but I don't think that this policy is a vote-getter.  To the extent it talks about corporate taxes, the Conservative election machine has focused on the absolute level of the tax burden rather than its distribution.  Proposals to increase the corporate tax aren't attacked for who pays the tax, but instead ""the tax-and-spend party wants to take <blank> billion for [etc etc]"".  This is in contrast with CPC arguments over their own tax cuts (the boutique tax credits including income splitting and the GST cuts), which focus very much on voters-in-particular paying less tax."

It could be a 99 cent tax cut but if most of the people who qualify for it are higher income earners, then sure this tax cut has negligible impact on revenue  because it's so small, but it's still regressive and still helps to worsen the income and wealth gaps  by a small amount.

Again in an economic sense this was absolutely the right way to achieve the goal, but doing so went against both left and right-wing populism.  To the dismay of the left, it fragmented the social safety net; to the dismay of the right it kept unpopular taxes (the GST) and raised income taxes further.  In terms of social policy, the 90s was characterized largely by federal non-interference (admittedly because national unity was a bigger file).  The abortion debate of the Mulroney administration was left quite dead, and the Federal government did not strenuously act against the cultural acceptance of same-sex rights, culminating in Martin's (belated) legislative adoption of same-sex marriage.  If you would prefer, I could also use the term ""neoliberal"" instead of ""technocratic,"" since they're similar enough for my purposes here.  Overall, the salient feature of this style of government is that when adopts a measure, it does so while imposing as little structure as possible.  A ""progressive"" policy adopted by a neoliberal/technocratic government would be more in the style of Joseph Heath than Naomi Klein, for example.  For the modern campaign, so far we've seen evidence of this sort of split.  Even though the parties have similar outcome goals, the NDP and Liberal platforms differ on their approaches.  The child-welfare plank is a wonderful example, where the NDP daycare proposal imposes a particular structure on the market whilst the Liberal plan is a means-tested cash benefit.  The NDP platform says, ""this is what Canada's child care should look like,"" whereas the Liberal one is essentially indifferent."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,8,Thu Jul 16 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"The NDP platform says, ""this is what Canada's child care should look like,"" whereas the Liberal one is essentially indifferent.   This is a theme. Child benefit vs. daycare is one example. Climate change (one size fits all cap and trade, vs. incentives and pick your own implementation), and electoral reform (MMB vs. a commission) are others."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,jtbc,6,Thu Jul 16 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're going to equate neoliberalism with technocracy (which is essentially going off of expert advice) you've rendered the term technocratic meaningless. You think neoliberal reform is good so anyone who agrees with you is a technocrat and those who don't are populists.   However, neoliberals are not the only ideological grouping of people who use expert advice or evidence-based policy. Surely, the Keynesian welfare state was technocratic, no? Keynsian technocrats (which the Liberals were, for a time) certainly can't be neoliberals."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,LastBestWest,11,Thu Jul 16 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"Surely, the Keynesian welfare state was technocratic, no? Keynsian technocrats (which the Liberals were, for a time) certainly can't be neoliberals.   I'd actually beg to differ here.  At the time, Keynesian economic policy would have very much qualified in the same sort of ""neoliberal"" category.  This policy reflects, as you put it, a technocratic approach to the problem of recessions and aggregate demand, and its solutions are ultimately extremely market friendly.  Most notably, Keynesian economic policy does not advocate common socialist policies such as nationalizing economically-essential industries for the purpose of directly guaranteeing full employment.  This policy would also have been disqualified from populism because it does not levy any charge of moral virtue or vice as being the root of recessions and poverty.  This contrasts with both old conservatism that would see the problem as one of a breakdown of social class and with revolutionary Marxism that would see the problem as one of an inevitable breakdown of social class.  However, over the past 80 years Keynesian economics has been improved upon; much of modern mainstream economics can reduce to Keynesian-type economics in a situation reminiscent of the Great Depression, but it extends upon this to better model not-Depression times.  In particular, modern economics has a much better handle on the role of monetary policy, which was less relevant in Keynes's day because of fixed exchange rates and the common use of the gold standard.  I would also like to take this opportunity to note that my working definition of ""neoliberal"" still admits plenty of room for income redistribution.  That would be a left/right split within a neoliberal framework. What makes this framework neoliberal is that whenever possible this redistribution should come in the form of a market, with non-market features introduced reluctantly and only as necessary to address market failures.  This contrasts with some of one definition of ""the left"" (namely collectivism and social ownership), but not all."

Meanwhile Mulcair is promising the rich he won't raise their taxes and  pushing regressive policies that are utilized far more by the wealthy while only targeting corporate taxes for increases which economists believe hurt workers more than the rich.    The NDP is perceived as the most progressive party because historically they have been but this just isn't the case anymore.  Anyone who still thinks the NDP is still the leftmost of the three parties is operating on out of date information that doesn't take currentl policies into account.  I admit I did this myself for a long time but I've realized now that getting stuck in the past doesn't benefit anyone and we need to look at the policies that exist in the present.  When we do that, it becomes obvious that Trudeau is more concerned about the middle class than Mulcair is.  Sadly none of them give a shit about the poor though andr this is what really pisses me off most about the NDP's shift.  There were the one party that focused on the poor and now we can't even trust them to focus on the iddle class, never mind the people who truly need our help the most.

Given the host of campaign promises being made by Mulcair (more than an additional 10B/year in spending over the next 5-8 years), it is hard to argue that the party is on the right. To me, it seems like the NDP wants to make the government both larger and to the benefit of the wealthy (ie, small business tax cuts that benefit doctors, lawyers etc, subsidized daycare spaces which benefits primarily the 9-5 upper-middle class).   I see the Liberals proposing policies that will actually help the middle and lower class, especially lower income families with children. Furthermore, they have costed their other positions, and are not greatly increasing the size of the federal government. In essence, the Liberals are implementing progressive policies without breaking the bank. The NDP could learn a thing or two."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,lomeri,6,Thu Jul 16 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"This is my problem with the NDP. They promise before elections without consequence. They did this in Nova Scotia, a province that has been broke for 20 years, and couldn't pay for anything. Heck they even fell into the same trends as previous governments.  I just see pure populism that has no financial basis, they're willingly to promise anything to win an election. I'm very progressive but at the end of the day I believe in financial responsibility.  We're in a recession now, and Harper is in denial about it, and Mulcair doesn't have a finance critic of any merit."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Drahos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"Given the host of campaign promises being made by Mulcair (more than an additional 10B/year in spending over the next 5-8 years), it is hard to argue that the party is on the right.   His policies have the appearance of being left-wing but the results are very much right-wing.  Look at subsidized daycare for example:  Wealthy families are more than twice as likely to use it compared to poorer families.  Another example is his removal of income splitting, which on the surface is progressive, until you realize he's replacing it with a business tax cut that benefits the middle class even less.  Then you have his corporate tax cuts, which also look like a progressive move but as many economists have noted, corporate tax cuts only generate short-term gains that also happen to harm workers more than they harm the shareholders since the business just compensates for the increase with downward pressure on wages.  To make matters worse, he says he will keep us at the OECD average for taxes, yet our corporate tax rate is already 1.5% higher than the OECD average, so just how much room does he have to raise taxes there?  Well, he has negative 1.5%.  So what's a good way to actually have progressive policies?  Well, a personal income tax increase that disproportionately affects higher income earners would do it... yet it's the one tax policy he refuses to even consider, even for the 'super-rich'!  These are the sorts of policies I would expect from the CPC.  Even income splitting, which was derided as being regressive gave the middle class $1B in tax cuts that Mulcair is canceling to give to business owners instead!   In essence, the Liberals are implementing progressive policies without breaking the bank. The NDP could learn a thing or two.   Very true.  Mulcair has no way to pay for his spending because he's promised policies that will not result in much more money coming in.  I suspect he will use debt to pay for it, but that just means he's leaving it up to the next government to decide how to compensate for those expenses, and my guess is that after a decade of NDP deficits it would most likely be a right-leaning government who would cover those expenses by slashing funding for the poor rather than raising taxes on the wealthy."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Legal420Now,5,Thu Jul 16 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"So the Liberals are the most left now? That tax move is not for the middle class, unless 100K a year is now middle class.

CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Eilanyan,5,Thu Jul 16 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"That tax move is not for the middle class, unless 100K a year is now middle class.   Trudeau's tax cuts apply between $44k and $89k while the tax increase applies over $200k.    That is more progressive than Mulcair's small business tax cut, which benefits far fewer in the middle class, while also not raising income taxes on the rich at all.    and want to keep most of Harper's austerity measures    So does Mulcair.  The only tax he wants to raise is corporate tax... to be at the OECD average, but we're already 1.5% higher than the OECD average, so how much room does he have to raise taxes?  Not to mention that corporate taxes are only 14% of government revenue anyways so even if he backtracked on his OECD average claim and raised taxes in a big way, it still wouldn't generate much money.  Also not to mention that many economists don't think corporate tax increases will actually generate more than a temporary boost in funding, most of which will come at the expense of workers rather than the rich anyways.  So, yes, I do believe the Liberals are the most left-wing party now.  Despite repeated accusations that I am a partisan NDP shill, I'm clearly more interested in policy over party if I'm able to abandon my roots and hold them accountable for their shift away from progressive policies."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Legal420Now,2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:42 2015 UTC,So neoliberal economists with neoliberal policy proposals are the reason we should not raise corporate taxes? Or how about universal programs like childcare that benefit everyone (harder for poor to access? Yes but same is true of healthcare)? Or fighting for higher min eage (only reason I am glad they will raise is becuase they said they will use it as leverage against the provinces to raise theirs to match).
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Eilanyan,8,Thu Jul 16 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"So neoliberal economists with neoliberal policy proposals are the reason we should not raise corporate taxes?    No, the evidence indicating it will hurt workers more than the shareholders is why we should not raise them and should instead raise personal income taxes, which Mulcair refuses to do.

Why should a rich person with kids get more assistance than poor person with kids or a poor person without kids?   Or fighting for higher min eage   That's only the federal minimum wage, which effects less than 1% of the population.  Minimum wage increases are not a good way to help the poor anyways, Trudeau's cash transfer system to them is much better."

If a rich family has more sick people they benefit more. We don't have a way for children to be ""severely"" children. Poor parents still benefit while people without kids get nothing. Qualitatively, I would argue access to something they could never afford as a poor parent as opposed to merely access to cheaper childcare is progressive. What also is important is politically it is a lot harder to cut a universal program rather then a means-tested one. Ideologically, the NDP say the state should help every person taking care of a child while the Liberals are arguing to help those who are somewhat poor to somewhat rich with children but not the outright poor or outright wealthy.   They will use it politically for min wage increases across country and helping that 1% of the population at little to no cost is a good thing if small."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Eilanyan,3,Thu Jul 16 16:36:00 2015 UTC,"The national daycare will exclude more mothers then you think and the ones that need it more. For mothers with children under 6 the labor participation rate is 67%, so right away you're excluding 33% of families, its more common then you think outside Vancouver and Toronto.    Of that 67% of working mothers or mothers looking for work (since its labor participation rate) how many work shift work?  How many have a multi-generation household?   How many live or will have access to a government daycare?    If you remove all those families you're only getting probably less then half of all families in Canada, and they probably work 9-5 jobs that have a higher average salary.

So I would say both are unfair to the poorest, but both are beneficial. I guess if I had to pick one I would pick daycare, if only for the hopes that because it is universal it instills that the state has a role in helping people with children take care of them and trying to move the Overton Window closer to the baby boxes of Finland."

I'd even argue the Con's are more left on this since UCCB still benefits the poorer parents more efficiently.   if only for the hopes that because it is universal it instills that the state has a role in helping people with children take care of them   Sorry but I hate this as a parent.  I want time or my wife to have time to raise my kids, not a government system.

Will the actual number of families be more rich than poor? I don't know either way, but considering the UUCB only impacts people making enough income to be taxed while childcare does not, is why I am more in favour of latter. The UUCB is more like a voucher program not a social program.   Is the UUCB high enough to work less hours? If yes, that's actually quite nice. But it doesn't help those who cannot afford to take time off or afford childcare. Government childcare is better then no childcare."

CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,6,Thu Jul 16 15:10:05 2015 UTC,"I feel like the left is based on redistribution, egalitarianism ,collectivism and social ownership. The right based on social order, national unity, and welfare chauvinism. We are arguing in the neoliberal centre over how much we should privatise to global capital social assets and how much we should socialize private activity (and losses). Austerity has come from the centre-left and centre-right of the political spectrum driven by technocratic elite views of public spending and debt (even though Keynesian social democracy has shown over and over to be a more effective generator of capital) not from the Left or Right. In Greece PASOK started austerity and ND continued it. The rightist faction of Syriza is also willing to fight austerity only if it is easy. KKE, Left Platform of Syriza (Left), Independent Greeks and Golden Dawn (Right) all oppose austerity and all but IG oppose capitalism."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Eilanyan,5,Thu Jul 16 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"Ouch, your axis is almost orthogonal to the one I prefer.  For example, I'm perfectly happy with redistribution within the context of a largely private economy.  A progressive income or consumption tax that funds a means-tested income benefit would be, in my opinion, a beneficial policy and probably superior to one that funds independent housing and food and education benefits.  However, this does not fit neatly within your left/right division."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,4,Thu Jul 16 15:28:57 2015 UTC,"That would be third-way centrism.

Milton Friendman would be an example, though his idea of basic income is less generous and from a small tax base then one you would prefer I am guessing though do not know for sure?"
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jul 16 15:33:36 2015 UTC,"Thomas Friendman would be an example   I'm not familiar with him in particular?  From a bird's-eye view, I would prefer to see the following combination of features in an economic system:   Moderate to high consumption taxes A generally progressive tax system Relatively low taxes on capital, especially on investment Relatively strong income redistribution   A basic income in this context seems like a good idea.  I'm essentially operating from an anti-old-Tory view, where I philosophically believe that people will on the balance make reasonable decisions for themselves when given adequate resources.    That means that I disagree both with enforced collectivism (which limits freedom of capital movement and investment) and with provision of ""real"" benefits such as government-owned housing over income benefits.  That opinion is somewhat pragmatic, however, and I'll freely make exceptions for cases where there is a significant collective action problem (like regulation of pollution) or where expert knowledge is required to make a reasonable decision (such as with medicine).  In practice, actually implementing my preferred approach would run into problems with people who are on the margins of capability.  If someone is functionally illiterate, for example, it may be a stretch to assume that their financial decisions are actually being made with full consideration of their own interests.    On the other hand, I strongly believe that the status quo of ad-hoc benefits works against the interest of those who are capable, reinforcing poverty and humiliation."

Mulcair has rejected direct subsidies tied to income and/or means-testing, both of which would ensure this program is utilized primarily by those who actually need the help.

CanadaPolitics,3di0av,CanadianHistorian,13,Thu Jul 16 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Who chooses which families will have access to that daycare?   In Québec, it's down to waiting lists at (I believe) the individual daycare level.  Wealither families have preferential access for structural reasons:   Wealthier families are more likely to have cars, so that they have access to more possibly-acceptable daycares Wealthier families are more likely to have fixed working schedules during business hours, such that they do not require childcare outside of hours provided in subsidized spots, and Wealthier families have a greater ability to buffer non-subsidized daycare expenses, such that they can afford more expensive daycare whilst waiting for a subsidized spot.  This allows them earlier access to the labour market and less disruption to a parent's work schedule."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"So clearly the only progressive solution is to dismantle the system entirely. The poor shouldn't get this program if the rich get it.

There are multiple ways of looking at this issue, and statements that are correct for one definition might be irrelevant or even wrong with other definitions.  Is progressivity measured by an absolute level of benefit to the poor, or relative to other classes?  Is a progressive solution market-skeptic?   In my comment above, I was speaking very narrowly about who has better access to a supposedly ""universal"" program in Québec.  That does not in and of itself mean that the system is not progressive, since again we have to be specific about our terminology."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,2,Thu Jul 16 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"Universality, equality, redistribution are usually considered universal aspects of progressivism. I consider it synonymous with centre-left and social democracy. Certainly, progressive is a vague term that could mean almost anything (progress), but I think it's pretty clear that it has taken on a meaning equivalent to moderate left, social democratic, or liberal (in the American sense).  My opposition to the Liberal childcare plan does come from weather I think it's progressive or not, but simply because I believe it will tonachive the goal of making childcare more affordable or accessible. It sounds like a great targeted welfare program that I could support, but I not in lieu of an program that actually seeks to address the childcare glut in most of this country.   In my comment above, I was speaking very narrowly about who has better access to a supposedly ""universal"" program in Québec.    I didn't contest anything in that post. What you reported seemed accurate to me. It's well-known the rich tend to take advantage of/have better access to u oversaw programs for reasons you mentioned and others.   I did note you put universal in air quotes there, implying not everyone has access to childcare in Quebec, which is true. Of course, no program is truly universal, as there will always be people who can not access services. This is true of out healthcare system as well. However, the term universal is simply to contrast with means-tested and targeted programs.    That does not in and of itself mean that the system is not progressive, since again we have to be specific about our terminology.   Agreed."

CanadaPolitics,3di0av,ThornyPlebeian,4,Thu Jul 16 14:27:40 2015 UTC,"You do know that childcare policy is about providing childcare. ""Lifting children out of poverty"" which of course, in this case is just a calculation based on the extra money the Liberal benefit provides, is not the direct goal of providing childcare (although having more accessible childcare reduce poverty would be great).  The Liberal plan in a direct cash benefit, instead of a proram to actually provide childcare spaces. It's actually pretty neoliberal given that it relies on the market to somehow create more species, despite the clear evidence the market is not doing that."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,LastBestWest,3,Thu Jul 16 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"that it relies on the market to somehow create more species, despite the clear evidence the market is not doing that.   I'm unsure how the NDP plan would create more daycare spaces.  Unless the NDP intends that provinces fully run essentially all daycares,  it will still ultimately rely on the market to create those spaces.  In implementation, any ""$X-per-day daycare"" works like a conditional benefit, where parents who choose to use daycare receive $Y-$X to pay for $Y of daycare, which the provider receives.  In practice, both $Y and the number of vouchers given are matters of public policy, which means that this is not an unlimited benefit.  The NDP plan probably would increase the net amount of money being spent on daycare, since the benefit is conditional.  (A parent who is otherwise indifferent to staying at home or working would have an additional nudge to go to work with the NDP plan.)  However, some of that subsidy will be at the intrinsic margin, in that it will benefit families who are already using (or would intend to use, for kids not yet born) daycare, which decreases the net effect.  Additionally, limits on both $Y and the number of vouchers act to reduce the efficacy of the program.  We see that in Québec, where despite the broad popularity of the program spaces are still rationed with waiting lists.  Waiting lists always indicate a lack of supply relative to demand."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,Majromax,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:39 2015 UTC,"Why are you discussing vickers?  The NDP plan is to transfer money to provinces to fund childcare centres. There centre's don't need to be government run, although I would certainly prefer funding he restocked to non-profit centres, given the considerable evidence that they genrally provide better care and are more efficient with grant money."
CanadaPolitics,3di0av,LastBestWest,3,Thu Jul 16 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Why are you discussing v[ouch]ers?    Because a voucher system is equivalent to transferring money to fund centres.  The day-care provider receives $Y per day per child, the parent pays $X which is a smaller amount, and the province makes up the difference.  Unless the province intends to fully supplant the daycare market (as is essentially done with schooling), then this depends on both the market and the government:   The market must be willing to provide the targeted level of daycare coverage at $Y per kid-day, and The government must be willing to fund the required number of daycare spots.   Things can go wrong on both ends of the system.  If $Y is too low to attract enough ""quality"" daycare providers, then there will either still be a shortage or the providers that do open will be the day-care equivalent of lemons (cars).  We see the first problem in some provinces with regards to health care, where reimbursement rates are too low to attract enough providers for market demand.  If the number of spots is too low, then day-care providers may be perfectly willing to open up but they will not be able to do so.  This seems to be the practical problem with Québec's implementation of daycare, in that Québec City does not provide enough subsidies to fully clear the market."

I like Wellstone but he held little power and major contribution was sruck down in Citizens United. Al Franken has been progressive on some issues (healthcare for one) but has toed party line many times and supports the NSA. Elizabeth Warren is progressive on economic regulation, student loans and decently on social programs. She does not speak to other issues and when she does like Israel, she is as hawkish as Obama (even endorsed Hilary Clinton). Sanders is the only one you listed that is actually progressive significantly beyond centre-left market solutions that Clinton, Chrietien and Blair supported and he is explictly not in the party and has ads on TV right now from the party against him. The democrats that voted against TPP also gave up after Obama gave them a small concession to have two up or down votes not just one.   Obama's regulations were piss-poor to begin with and have been consistently strangled to uselessness including by his own Administration, Attorney General and Department of Justice. At least Clinton only had temporary military excrusions while Obama fought to extend Bush's deadline in Iraq and wants to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. As well as bomb civilians through drones around the middle east. And spy on everyone, anytime for any reason (or no reason). Or how he kept most of Bush's tax rates rather than Clinton's. Or how Clinton's welfare reform looks rather nice compared to Obama's austerity and cuts to social programs (even his stimulus was half tax cuts and he keeps wanting to cut social security and medicare through a Grand Bargain and chained CPI). His stance on TPP makes Clinton's NAFTA view downright protectionist."

A classic example of a false dichotomy. If anything, Canada's usual 3-party system has demonstrated that good policy comes from nuanced debate and positions on a range of issues.  Furthermore, most western countries don't have a 2-party or 2-way debate - they engage in PR and often elect coalition governments.  The NDP are in such a hurry to get elected, they replaced half of their platform with 90's era Liberal policies and are accusing 2015 Liberals of not being progressive enough. Ironic, isn't it?  *Edit: a word."

CanadaPolitics,3di0av,LastBestWest,4,Thu Jul 16 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"A good point brought up in this article is how Canadian politics has often turned issues of regionalism, language, and the Quebec national question, instead of the left-right debates that dominate in other countries.  The Liberals' style of brokerage politics, that is not informed by any ideology or strong principles, allowed this style of clientelistic politics to continue in Canada much longer than it did on other industrial nations, and one of the reasons Canada never had a class-based voting system that all the other industrial democracies had (class voting has been declining across the western world in recent decades). Perhaps, the Liberals were just better able to recognize that ethic, regional, and linguistic cleavage were very impatnant in Canada and exploited them, meaning that Canada's sociology encouraged the Liberals' brokerage politics. However, it's pretty evident that (at least historically) the existence of the Liberal Party made political debate in Canada much less vamues and policy based and mire focised on sectarian issues than in most other similar countries.  • I should also note that the Conservatives and PCs were also an ideology-lite brokerage party. I focused on the Liberals because that is what the topic is on and it's pretty evident, at least to me, that after the rise of the Reform Party, conservative politics became much more values and policy based and less based on clinetalism."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,trollunit,36,Thu Jul 16 12:52:39 2015 UTC,"I can't say that I agree with this article. I find myself attracted to the Liberals because a significant amount of policies on both the NDP and CPC sides are too radical for me, and I consider myself a centrist. There's a reason why I don't vote for them, and why many don't either.  Also, I remain unconvinced that the united right is here to stay. So long as Harper is around, certainly, but once he is gone the current crop of potential successors does not look to have the same ability to maintain a united front as he did. On top of all of this of course is the likelihood of a switch away from FPTP in the aftermath of the coming election, which I believe will provide incentive for the party to split up again (and I would not be surprised to see similar splits in at least the NDP, and maybe the Liberals. These splits however likely wouldn't happen for a few years).  I think it is important to keep in mind though that even if they polls as they stand right now are correct, the Liberals have still tripled their seat count from the previous election. That is in no way a loss in my books. On top of that, the attack ads of ""Just not ready"" will ring even less true in the next election cycle, and if the current polls stay true to election day, Trudeau will find himself given an opportunity to establish himself as a very powerful player in the house as the CPC and NDP will have to court him to pass their legislation.  All in all, I think that reports on the Liberal party's impending death is greatly exaggerated, and we're likely to see no matter what a stronger Liberal part emerge from this election."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,thebrokendoctor,10,Thu Jul 16 13:43:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.   likely with fewer seats and no leader   I don't think it's realistic to speculate that the Liberals are likely going to have their seat count reduced, as there has really been no basis for this in any polls."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,idr6,15,Thu Jul 16 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that line especially threw me for a loop since there is absolutely zero indication that that is what is going to happen. It would require an astronomical collapse of the party during the campaign and the only way I could see this happening is if Trudeau came out and said that he would institute a national military service or remove all taxes."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,thebrokendoctor,9,Thu Jul 16 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I think the author momentarily conflated the polls with the actual seat count in the HoC.   Since Trudeau took over the LPC, people seem to have kinda quietly forgotten that LPC only has 36 seats in the HoC right now. Coming out of the election with 90ish only looks bad because people seemed firmly convinced for a while that they'd win 180."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,Irrational_Actor,7,Thu Jul 16 15:17:55 2015 UTC,I didn't get the whole Trudeau resigning statement either in the article.  I highly doubt the Liberals want to switch leaders again unless they completely bomb in October.
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,kofclubs,7,Thu Jul 16 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The only way he would resign is if the Liberals completely bomb, and it's seen as being directly his fault. (i.e. His debate performances are atrociously bad and cause a total collapse in the polls)"
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,Irrational_Actor,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:04 2015 UTC,"On top of all of this of course is the likelihood of a switch away from FPTP in the aftermath of the coming election,    I'm not this optimistic. I'm hopeful for a switch, but every party at some point has said they'd switch away from FPTP in previous elections too, nothing's happened in that time. Media barely covers it, when it should be one of the most pressing issues. Conservatives even campaigned on it before they took over."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,stratius,0,Thu Jul 16 17:45:30 2015 UTC,Meh if we end up with IRV (Truedau's system of choice) it has all the same problems as FPTP.

CanadaPolitics,3di00g,PickledOnionz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"Isn't IRV a ranked ballot? I don't see how it forces alignment, there's always the option to just select one candidate and if that candidate is eliminated the vote is lost, but that was the voters choice. They should know the risk.  Whatever change is (hopefully) made the most important thing will be that an extremely aggressive approach is taken to educate the public on how the new system will work. The worst scenario is a new method for voting is chosen and nobody heading to the polls has a clear understanding of how it works."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,CupOfCanada,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"IRV is a ranked ballot in single member ridings.   there's always the option to just select one candidate and if that candidate is eliminated the vote is lost, but that was the voters choice.    So in Australia they don't actually have that choice.  At least not federally (some states such as Queensland do give you that option).  When we used IRV in BC, Alberta and Manitoba we didn't force people to rank more than one candidate.     Whatever change is (hopefully) made the most important thing will be that an extremely aggressive approach is taken to educate the public on how the new system will work.    Manitoba used it for decades and they had a long term decline in the number of people bothering to rank anyone second.  (Though it's worth noting in the last election it was used there was an uptick in people  In Queensland, where you don't have to rank anyone second, the major parties tell their supporters to just ""rank 1."" IE don't cast a second preference.  Now, suppose parties did advise their supporters on who to rank second.  You're the leader of a centrist party.  Who do you tell your supporters to rank second? Third? At some point you need to make a choice between left and right, and in doing so cease to be the centre.  From the PSA in the UK's briefing paper:   Still, there is a question over the future of the Liberal Democrats in the UK. The simulations assume they will stick together and benefit from AV. But AV would put pressure on the Liberal Democrats as a party to state to whom they would like their supporters to give their second preferences: Australian experience suggests that parties generally gain from issuing such guidance. 38 In current circumstances, that might increase the likelihood of a split in the party between left and right. On the other hand, the Australian Democrats achieved success for some years without issuing guidance, hoping thereby to attract support from both left as well as right.39  The Liberal Democrats in the UK might be able to maintain the same strategy.   Note that ""success"" here is apparently attracting 12% of the vote but winning 0 seats.  Also:   There is a logic, long recognized among political scientists, according to which an electoral system such as AV should be expected to produce two-bloc politics, or “bipolar multipartism”: a system with many parties in which those parties line up into two fairly stable blocs.3   So here's the situation:  Either less than half of voters bother to rank anyone second, as was the case in Alberta and Manitoba, and you just have FPTP, with the same results in ~98% of ridings, and scads of MPs still elected with less than 50% of the vote.  Or more a lot more than half of voters bother to rank anyone second, and you get two-bloc politics, with a coalition of the right competing against a coalition of the left.  Here's the briefing paper if you're interested."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,CupOfCanada,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:22 2015 UTC,I should add that this isn't just my view - it's also the view the Political Studies Association of the UK put out in their briefing paper.  I'm on mobile so don't have the link handy but if you Google AV briefing paper political studies it should come up.  Look at Australia - they had a centrist party but weren't ever able to take a single seat under IRV despite getting 12% of the vote.  France and their two round system? Virtually 0 centrists. Louisiana? No centrists.
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,unjung,0,Fri Jul 17 00:10:46 2015 UTC,"You didn't read the article, obviously.   The Liberals occupy an unlikely place in the political spectrum: the centre (or as it’s known in political science, “the median”). Perhaps they continue to exist for the same reason that Tinkerbelle does — because we all believe they do. Or at least we used to. But it looks now as if the centre cannot hold. It looks like we are finally catching up to old Duverger and his law — or at least something like it.  With the NDP and the Conservatives topping recent polls and the Liberal party under Justin Trudeau going from tiger to paper tiger, the party is in decline. NDP support has been climbing for some time; and while Conservative support has dropped, the Liberal decline is more significant — and the implications more dire. The Liberals look to be finally getting squeezed out of the middle. With a united political right and the NDP moving towards the centre, there’s no position on the spectrum that is uniquely Liberal. Cannon to the left of them, cannon to the right of them. The party has become redundant in a way that no progressive or conservative party is in Canada.  If Liberal support continues to fall and it once again finds itself the third party following the election (likely with fewer seats and no leader, since Trudeau will probably resign), then Canada will have another left-right House of Commons without much need for the Liberals. That might be enough to seal the party’s fate right there. If they are indeed roundly defeated — the way the Progressive Conservatives were in 1993 — it’s unlikely that there will be a way back for them.  If I were a Liberal strategist I’d be very worried. Indeed, if I were a Liberal strategist I would have the party pandering to Canadians by any means necessary: supporting overzealous anti-terror legislation, throwing unpopular Senate colleagues under the bus, offering tax cuts like after-dinner mints, pushing hollow rhetoric about “hope” and “hard work”, kowtowing to the (undefined) middle class, and talking about changing the electoral system in the unlikely event my party was able to eke out an unlikely victory."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,Cowtown12,4,Thu Jul 16 19:28:26 2015 UTC,"I did read the article. Again I disagree. Not to long ago the liberal party was in the lead and articles were being written saying the NDP will be the third party again. These article are so reactionary. Just because the liberals are third in the polls now doesn't mean its game over. There is still lots of election left. In regards to the mythical center, I still believe the center is best place to be on the political spectrum. It's a balance and a lot of Canadian agree with that or we wouldn't have 6 liberal premiers or many liberal prime ministers. Of the three main parties each on of them have been down and out. Like all three the liberals will be back."

Peter Newman wrote a whole book about this after the 2011 disaster (When the Gods Changed: The Death of Liberal Canada), and Bricker and Ibbitson reached the same conclusion in The Big Shift. As a Liberal, I am beginning to feel at least a little bit like Mark Twain.  None of these people seem to be able to counter the obvious vitality of the party, though. All the indicators of party health; fundraising, volunteer recruitment, candidate recruitment, membership numbers; indicate a party that is rebuilding itself quite well, thank you.   if I were a Liberal strategist I would have the party pandering to Canadians by any means necessary:    He goes on to list a bunch of policies and branding, the party's last gasps of breath, I guess, all of which were formulated when the party had the lead in the polls, rather than the last ditch clutching at straws he'd have us imagine.   But my interlocutors should first ask themselves: why do we need the Liberal party?    Because, as others have said, a whole lot of moderate, mildly progressive, mildly fiscally conservative Canadians think our country does better when it is governed by pragmatism than ideology. We are not about to join the NDP, no matter how regressive their taxation policy, and we are certainly not about to join the Conservatives, even if they grudgingly accept same sex marriage. A lot of us would probably be OK with the old PC's if we had to make a second pick, but that other centrist, brokerage party no longer exists as an option."
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,Eilanyan,8,Thu Jul 16 18:44:20 2015 UTC,My personal issues with the Liberal party is not that it exists (of course it should if it gets votes) but that it tries to portray itself as a progressive party not a centrist one. If anything it is the centre-right party given we have the NDP in the centre and Conservatives as right.
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,KillerCronic,22,Thu Jul 16 14:45:26 2015 UTC,They are progressive. Same way conservatives can be progressive and the NDP may be progressive. The far left doesn't have a monopoly on progressive policies.  Case in point. Liberals introduced the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Universal Healthcare. While the Conservatives introduced (Un)Employment Insurance.  What have the NDP done?
CanadaPolitics,3di00g,Eilanyan,6,Thu Jul 16 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"Universal Healthcare was the work of the CCF and the Charter is a continuation of the PC's Canadian Bill of Rights. That's not to say Liberals should not get any credit, but to suggest that they have led progressive policy is simply not true. They were against the welfare state expansion more than the Red Tory governments and in government were far less open to Keynsian welfare then UK or US were.   I'm not really sure what you mean by far-left. Unless the Liberals have promoted social ownership over the means of production and a classless society I don't know how they are the ""progressive"" party. If you mean the NDP, they have never been far-left and started as a social democratic party and have moved right even since. The CCF was mildly a socialist party and they did do good things for poverty, social ownership and human welfare in Sask."

Economics is a complex game and I won't pretend that either of these two parties will master it, but at this point, we're already on the brink of running aground... changing direction at this point is arguably no more harmful than continuing the course we're on (sorry for the mixed metaphor there)."
CanadaPolitics,3di5jz,safety_jam,3,Thu Jul 16 15:18:53 2015 UTC,FPTP makes this meaningless unless our political culture starts to accept that the largest plurality of seats does not necessarily mean forming government.
CanadaPolitics,3di5jz,Eilanyan,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen at least a couple of recent polls suggesting that Canadians are fine with coalitions.  If things turn out like the polls are currently predicting, it will be a completely different situation than in 2008. There were several factors that made the coalition politically untenable. Stephane Dion had decreased the Liberals' standing, had pledged to resign as leader, and signed a deal with separatists. If the current polls come true, the BQ won't need to be involved, both the Liberals and NDP will have made gains, the CPC will make losses, and neither Trudeau or Mulcair is likely to be forced out of leadership. The ""coalition of losers"" talking point won't be effective this time, because Harper would be the biggest loser of the campaign."
CanadaPolitics,3di5jz,QuizzicalButthead,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:01:57 2015 UTC,I agree but historically we have not had agreements that made the government with the plurality not in government except for rare provincial cases like Ontario before the Rae Days.

But if the CPC wins the most seats and the NDP and Liberals form a coalition of losers to usurp that power, I doubt most Canadians would approve."

Coalitions have never been a campaign issue before this year. Maybe you could argue people punished the Liberals last election for pursuing a coalition, but I don't see how one election qualifies as ""the last few elections."" I'm also not sure why a coalition would even be necessary if the Conservatives were in second."
CanadaPolitics,3di5jz,QuizzicalButthead,14,Mon Jul 20 01:35:54 2015 UTC,That is a call to arms if I ever heard one. The Liberals are also ran at this point and the ABC vote needs to fall into line behind the NDP. Whether that happens or not is the big question. I am still very concerned about the Liberals just getting enough traction to split the votes and allow  few thousand people across the country be the difference of PM Harper getting a fresh mandate.
CanadaPolitics,3di5jz,UnionGuyCanada,13,Thu Jul 16 15:37:37 2015 UTC,"This. It's how Harper has been our PM for so long. A strong majority of Canadians want him out - but we can't seem to decide between Liberal and NDP. I personally would be very happy with a LIB/NDP coalition led by Tom Mulcair, but we all know the chances of that happening.   (this is where I get downvoted) I urge all our Liberal friends to watch the polls closely. If the NDP representative in your area has a good chance at knocking out a CON, vote for the NDP!"

There are ridings where the NDP aren't competitive. Sadly, I happen to live in an Ontario riding where this is the case. I haven't seen a single projection model giving the NDP a chance in my riding, and the candidate is a joke. Using this simulator, giving the NDP 40% support in Ontario still leaves the NDP 5 points short of the Liberals in my riding.   IMO, it's too early to think about strategic voting anyway. We haven't seen a single debate or platform. The numbers can move, and it's far from certain that the NDP will end up ahead of the Liberals as Election Day draws near. Already, you're starting to hear that the NDP don't have a clear plan while the Liberals do. What you're saying may indeed come to pass, but can we wait until at least October to start advocating strategic voting?"

If you make 30k it's a hit each month but those that earn 300k hardly notice it. The high earners do notice their low tax rate,  which is made available by charging everyone MSP which goes into general revenue.

CanadaPolitics,3dgaa0,tvrr,5,Thu Jul 16 05:04:18 2015 UTC,"Generally the ROI on debt repayment is very low. The interest costs are very small (only a couple of percent). As long as the debt is small, interms of %GDP (BC is 17.4%) there aren't many problems caused by the debt and the surplus money can be better spent on either improving government programs or on tax breaks. Inflation and GDP growth will eat away at the debt even if its doesn't get repaid and the money instead will go to more economically stimulating purposes besides giving the bond holders some more cash."
CanadaPolitics,3dgaa0,Wonka_Raskolnikov,6,Thu Jul 16 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"This is true during times of economic stability.

CanadaPolitics,3dgaa0,Move_Zig,6,Thu Jul 16 05:42:00 2015 UTC,"As a general rule 90%-100% GDP for national debt and 70-80% for governments that don't control their own currencies (i.e. provinces or in the case of the Eurozone individual countries) is when debt starts to be a problem. There isn't a hard and fast rule. Canada in the mid 90s was an example of when debt repayment started to become necessary.  Factors to consider are debt servicing costs, which are influenced by credit ratings, which attempted to evaluate the likelihood the debt will be repaid. The lower the chance of default the higher the credit rating and the lower the interests. Credit rating is influenced by economic prospects, government fiscal management and amount of debt already incurred."

I don't think it was the unions, or their stance on the pipeline, or Adrian Dix's baggage. Something cataclysmic must have happened to re-elect the BC Liberals. My hunch is that the NDP's campaign was really weak. Dix didn't go on the attack enough, and criticize the BC Liberals' record.   Now that I think about it, the NDP ran a very weak campaign. Their platform consisted of: ""we're not the BC Liberals"", freezes in ferry fares, tuition cuts, and I can't think of anything else. They just sat back and expected the win to be handed to them, they weren't hungry, they didn't have passion.   In addition, the BCGP surged in popularity and the BC Conservatives were seen for what they really are (a fringe party), which ended up uniting the right and splitting the left.  Any thoughts?  Edit: Also, I feel it was almost defamation how Christy Clark linked the HST to the BC NDP, when it was Bill Vander Zalm of the freaking Social Credit party (predecessor of the BC Liberals) who got the wheels spinning on the HST referendum.  Edit 2: Speaking of passion: Horgan as leader has charisma and passion that Dix and James did not have, and more importantly he is keeping his mouth shut unlike Dix (I wonder how Dix would handle the Nestle water thing as NDP leader), and actually dares to agree with the Liberals and Greens in legislature debates. Definitely the best NDP leader since Harcourt. Maybe better than Harcourt, actually, since he's not calling social assistance recipients ""welfare bums"", or calling for the clear-cut of Clayquot Sound. I don't think I'll rank Horgan among the likes of Dave Barrett, but you never know.  In addition, the NDP has done a lot to get rid of the 90s baggage within the party, but not enough in my opinion. They need to boot Dix, James and Farnworth from caucus, sever their ties with big public sector unions (e.g. BCTF, BCFL), and get rid of that damn $2,000 candidate entry fee."

The common thinking now is that the province will revert to an even split of 4/5 Liberals, 5/4 Conservatives, and 1 NDP.   The provincial Liberals have underwhelmed at best. Premier Gallant's approval rating is hovering around 30%. Our economy remains stalled with no signs of improving. The federal Conservatives have lately been attacking Premier Gallant, and tying his unpopularity to the federal Liberal campaign.   Saint John MP Rodney Weston used the announcement of $68M of federal money to improve the Port of Saint John to attack Gallant for not supporting the project. John Williamson (previously best known for his ""pay white people to stay home while brown people come to work"" comments) has been on local CBC radio, again attacking the provincial Liberals.  As a bonus to the federal campaign in NB, Justin Trudeau will be in Fredericton on Monday. Fredericton is a Conservative seat (held by Keith Ashfield), and the Liberals are pushing hard to flip it back red."

New Brunswick used to make things. Thanks to free trade and back room deals with His Royal Majesty, MR IRVING, manufacturing and fabrication is all but non-existent now.

That's how Saskatchewan turned their province around and we had the same opportunity to do so. His only economic plan was to handout millions of dollars to Liberal friendly construction companies.  Moreover, our healthcare system offers equality of coverage to all citizens. What Premier Gallant did by forcing seniors to pay more for nursing care is downright nasty.  His only rebuttal is having his MLA's go around to local community meetings and telling seniors, the ones who have saved money their entire lives and decided not to buy a second home or a boat, you're shit out of luck.

CanadaPolitics,3dg2ck,ScotiaTide,7,Thu Jul 16 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"Let's face it: Toronto police have a problem with armed criminals and a populace who feel emboldened to argue with police officers. As a Torontonian whose has witnessed people arguing with the police, I'm surprised there aren't more police involved shootings.   The fatal shooting of Andrew Loku is tragic, but is complicated by its purported racial undertones. Would a mentally ill, weapon wielding, Caucasian suspect be shot under similar circumstances? Well, the answer to that question is Yes. So, is Andrew Loku's death a racial issue? Or is it one of mental health?   The fact that Loku's death was capitalized on by groups claiming that it's a racial issue instantly clouds the argument and removes the facts from the case, drawing a more nebulous argument about racial politics and equity in policing, which is, frankly Nietzsche's abyss.   I've lost a relative in a heinous manner, and it deeply impacted me. I once saw a terrible car accident, and that too impacted how I drive. How then do police officers react when on a daily basis they are called to the sorts of human traumas that scar people? How do we ask them to 'un-learn' their response to violent attackers and ask them to reconsider how they interact with people when it's their job to deal with violent and dangerous criminals? We find it so easy to criticize the police for making split second decisions; yet, we're so indifferent to their rationale.   I feel bad for police officers and more too for their families who are often innocent bystanders in a broader political drama that unfolds in the various new outlets of the city. I feel bad for police officers who've been asked to do a job then roundly criticized by people for 'failing us.' Here's the simple fact: they do a job that few of us will ever do and deal with the sorts of human tragedy that we just don't want to deal with. Ask yourself: If the Police hadn't shot, and he'd injured or killed someone, would we not be writing on this board about ineffective policing with a bloated budget and poor leadership?

CanadaPolitics,3dg2ck,amnesiajune,7,Thu Jul 16 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't have any strong feelings about the Loku shooting one way or another. One eyewitness says that Andrew didn't have a chance to say anything before he was shot, so I don't know if that can meaningfully be said to be arguing. That said, approaching police officers with a hammer in hand isn't a great idea (especially when you are a black male).   The OP was complaining about a populace who ""feel emboldened to argue with police"". That clearly implies a much more systemic ""problem"" of citizens of all colours and backgrounds, and is a position that I can't agree with at all."
CanadaPolitics,3dg2ck,lapsed_pacifist,4,Thu Jul 16 15:25:34 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly sure Loku would have been shot if he was white as well.  I believe the police could have better handled the situation and possibly avoided killing him.  Two officers responded at the same time, one of them could have possibly tried pepper spray while the other had his pistol drawn, ready to shoot.  Despite some possible problems in how they handled the situation, the police didn't murder / execute him.  This wasn't a shooting of an unarmed individual, like we have been frequently seeing in the US.  If you pull a weapon on police in a confined space, expect a lethal outcome.  If someone broke into my place wielding a hammer, I'd do everything in my power to neutralize the threat.  If a firearm was available they would be shot."

To illustrate my point further: I moved to a poor area of my hometown, and there is far more police there than in my old neighbourhood.

We can talk about increasing the effectiveness of their training, doing a better job of screening potential officers to try and filter out 'bad apples' before they put the uniform on, we can provide veteran cops better mental services to avoid the 'fish bowl' syndrome and other mental health issues which can lead them to becoming a bad apple later in their careers, etc etc etc.  But for the people they are interacting with, which is partly caused by past discrimination, by the time that interaction happens, the past's impacts have already had their effect. It's not the police's job to deal with that, as that is not their job.   We need to work as a society to reduce the rate of that interaction. As we move towards harsher punishments, and the erosion of funding for rehabilitation programs continues (nobody wants to be seen 'huggin a thug'), it becomes even more important to have things in place before that first police interaction can happen."

While some people, possibly Cole as you say, might push things too far, I think that by and large, general society would be very uncomfortable with the number of bad apples if we had a concrete figure.   I'm not saying its the majority, I don't believe that for a second. But honestly, how comfortable would you be if we knew that about 10% of cops were 'bad apples'? That's 1 in 10 cops.

CanadaPolitics,3dg2ck,justanotherreddituse,21,Thu Jul 16 05:20:35 2015 UTC,"There's a pretty big barrier of understanding on what ""racism"" means in a given context. For some people racism is only defined as somebody hating (or loving) a certain race for whatever reason. For some people racism is only defined as a systemic issue regarding disproportionate outcomes for different racial or ethnic groups. Neither side does a very good job making themselves understood or making the effort to understand the other perspective in most mainstream conversations about these issues, and I'm convinced the chief gap in building that understanding is the unwillingness of people to understand that both meanings of ""racism"" are valid in their specific context, and trying to understand the term appropriately for a given use.   Two equally frustrating examples: you'll often see people respond to suggestions of systemic racism against natives by citing how much federal funding reserves receive, and claiming the federal government does what it can and doesn't show any malicious intent. This only views racism as hatred and divorces it from social realities and makes it difficult to discuss the problem without large-scale handwaving.  Another thing that often happens is an insistence by those discussing systemic racism, frequently academics, that ""white people can't be the subject of racism"", usually because racism is the combination of prejudice and social power, and white people are the most socially empowered in our society. This ignores the understanding of what ""racism"" means in common parlance, as an interpersonal exchange of bigotry without necessarily bringing in a broader social context, and it makes it harder to have discussions about interpersonal race relations because it attempts to marginalize majority perspectives in favour of having a conversation that said majority are simply tuned out of.   Understanding that people interact on both an individual and broader and broader social scales is important, but none of the advocates on either side of these debates (or at least those debates I see online) appear particularly interested in viewing things through their appropriate lens."

Hollow points (expanding ammunition) isn't illegal in Ontario.  I'm not sure what Toronto Police use, but various types of expanding ammunition are the standard for almost any police force in North America.  Furthermore, they actually won't penetrate as far into flesh or other objects.  The lack of penetration ability is critical for public safety, if the police miss their shot is only going to go through one wall and lose most of it's power.

Would just over 50 per cent be enough to make a country or not?  A: That’s the way we’ve always talked about it, and everybody else has. What we’re talking about here is the notion of negotiating, and someone who comes in with a very weak mandate is in a very weak position to negotiate. So it’s not a question of UDI [Unilateral Declaration of Independence]; that’s never been on the table, as far as we’re concerned.   Am I the only one who found this odd? Mulcair's, and the NDP in general, have consistently been arguing that 50% +1 is strong enough to begin negotiations for Quebec's secession but now we find out it will be a ""weak"" position. So they will, what, shrug off a bare majority vote for secession because it's not ""strong"" enough? Be less open to negotiations from a bare majority vote? That's the whole point of a demand for a strong majority by the LPC. To ensure a clear mandate. I feel like Mulcair is just getting to the same position of the LPC (no idea what the CPC view is on this) but is branding a bare majority as enough to begin talks. It seems very disingenuous to how the NDP has previously framed their policy on Quebec secession. I wonder how many soft nationalist know that this is the NDP's intent now.

Mulcair's current clarification does not disagree with that point, it simply gives a little more perspective on how weak a 50%+1 negotiating mandate would be.  I still think that the NDP's position here is not as strong as the LPC's Clarity Act, which is more in keeping with the SCOC's reference that the mandate must be unambiguous in terms of the question asked and the majority vote. I think 50%+1 leaves too much room for ambiguity due to the many administrative and other issues that can cause the final vote outcome to not exactly reflect the will of the people."

I also don't think his clarification disagrees with this at all either but I think it adds a qualifier or distinction that wasn't there before, this being the relative strength of a mandate.   Without that distinction, it's easy to think that soft nationalists/separatists may have felt a vote for the NDP is the next best option to the Bloc because the bar is set lower than the LPC for talks to begin if a referendum were to be held. The addition of a mandates strength certainly puts him more in line with what the LPC has been saying, with the exception that the LPC qualifier is that without a strong mandate (I don't know, 60%? 66%?), talks will not begin. Where the NDP would listen but ... I don't know, give it less importance? Believe they have to give up less in negotiations?"
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,Hoarse-horse,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed, agreed, and agreed. I think the NDP are probably still the best bet for soft nationalists given that being at the secession negotiation table with a weak mandate is I'm sure considered far and away better than not even entering into talks, but it certainly isn't as good as the interpretation of the Sherbrooke declaration as 50%+1 = secession that they may previously have been entertaining."

What ""party it used to be"" are you talking about?  McDonough's?  McLaughlin's?  Douglas'?  Because, dude, it looks about the same way it did a year after Layton picked it up some decade-plus ago.

Beside that, he's not even listening to that caucus as he's ignored many of their urges to to do things like raise taxes on the wealthy, which he refuses to do.  The policies of Mulcair are radically different from Layton's in many ways.  Layton did not support tax policies that mainly benefit the wealthy, nor did he support subsidies that mainly benefit them, nor did he support free trade agreements, nor did he support continuing the war on drugs.  Mulcair has specifically promised not to do anything left-wing.    Layton would never promise not to do anything left-wing.  It goes against everything he stood for.

Now give me a moment to see if I can find a back-copy of the policy manual that's on the website because I'd bet good money it's at least 90% the same document it was five years ago.  The membership determines policy at conventions, and I can only speak for myself but I don't think the party has had some magical 50% or more turnover in members in the past few years.  The policy's nearly identical."

If their policies no longer resemble the sort of policies they promoted under Layton (or any other previous NDP leader for that matter), then why should I care if they have the same caucus?   Like my link demonstrated (Did you read it?) Mulcair is now controlling the party and old-school NDP insiders are now being ignored on issues like free trade, legalization and tax increases for the wealthy, all of which once would have been no-brainers for the old NDP, and which the new NDP has a very different stance on.     I'd bet good money it's at least 90% the same document it was five years ago.   You go right ahead and do that.  I doubt you're accurate and even if 90% were the same, the 10% that aren't happen to be key fiscal issues around the rich/poor divide, which was always the NDP's strong point for progressives.

""I think it reflects that the party wants debate on these kinds of issues.""   from the same article doesn't really point to Mulcair as a dominating figure, McQuaig ran for office under his watch, with his support, and the party knew full well what she was about.  It's not like she even considered running for the Greens or Liberals, those two being so far from her value set.  If McQuaig's the type of candidate Mulcair is running there doesn't seem to be much to commend your concept of him not allowing dissent or stifling the left.  and    If their policies no longer resemble the sort of policies they promoted under Layton (or any other previous NDP leader for that matter), then why should I care if they have the same caucus?   you should care because the policies are almost identical, I'm sure I'm low-balling it at 90%.

I don't care if the same people are there if they are embracing very different policies.  Their promises, not their DNA or their identities, will determine the direction this country goes under the NDP.   you should care because the policies are almost identical,   No, I disagree, I think they are very different.  See: their policies on tax cuts for the rich, daycare subsidies for the upper class, free trade, etc.  I guess we'll know for sure once you do that comparison you said you'd do.  Let me know when it's done please because I seriously doubt it will be even close to 90%, but like I said, even if it were, it still wouldn't matter if that 10% difference was on all the policies that are important to me and that seems to be where they've made the biggest changes."

The NDP has always supported trade (the CCF opposed the protective tariff), but don't necessarily support trade agreements. Under Mulcair they were strongly opposed to the Canada-China FIPPA and have voiced numerous concerns with CETA. They have not supported CETA or TPP.    nor did he support continuing the war on drugs.   Neither does Mulcair. He supports immediate decriminalization and is not opposed to legalization."

CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,NotKennyG,4,Thu Jul 16 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"Neither does Mulcair.    That's incorrect.  He's promising business tax cuts that will only benefit the wealthy, a daycare program that will be utilized by higher income earners more than twice as often as low income earners, and the cancellation of income splitting, $1B of which went to the middle class.  Meanwhile, the wealthy will still be able to utilize income splitting and he's promised outright now to raise their income taxes.   Layton supported supply management.   Who said anything about supply management?  Beside that, I'm pretty sure all 3 parties support that one.   It was Layton who dropped the NDP's traditional and ineffectual opposition to NAFTA.

Considering it has a larger benefit to the wealthy and basically no benefit to the poor I don't see how wanting it to remain could be considered a progressive policy.  Oddly even your link below points out income splitting is not a progressive policy since the benefit skews as income increases.  How exactly would the wealthy continue to utilize income splitting if income splitting was removed? Do you mean the tax avoidance with CCPCs? That is more an issue with CCPCs being abused than a small business tax cut."
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,EngSciGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"Considering it has a larger benefit to the wealthy and basically no benefit to the poor   I said middle class, not poor, and half of that money went to the middle class according to the PBO.   The problem I have with Mulcair is that his replacement tax cuts also go disproportionately to the wealthy.   If I wanted policies like that I would have been voting CPC this entire time.   I voted NDP because they could have been better than this but they're not.  They fooled me and many others but we are waking up now.   How exactly would the wealthy continue to utilize income splitting if income splitting was removed?  Do you mean the tax avoidance with CCPCs? That is more an issue with CCPCs being abused than a small business tax cut.   Your last sentence doesn't make any sense to me.  The tax cuts are separate from how business owners use income splitting.  Mulcair is not ending that policy and this effectively means that business owners now get a business tax cut and they get to keep splitting their income, while the poor and middle class get almost nothing from him... just subsidized daycare, which is also used disproportionately by wealthier families.  I'm sorry these are just not progressive policies.  They are everything I opposed in Harper and Trudeau.  Elizabeth May or Trudeau can now earn my vote because they have actual progressive policies."
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,Legal420Now,9,Wed Jul 15 23:36:08 2015 UTC,"I know you didn't say poor, I did. A progressive policy would be putting more towards the poor vs. the wealthy. Hence why wanting it to remain is not a progressive policy.  Half of the total amount went to the middle class, but it is also important to look at what the middle class is being bracketed as. The finance minister has previously stated a household income of $120,000 is in the middle class, even though that is 40% above the median household income. Ergo I still fail to see why you would not want this canceled if you still consider yourself 'leftwing/progressive'.   Your last sentence doesn't make any sense to me.   I don't understand why it wouldn't. The article you linked explains how the CCPCs are abused. Further any small business tax cut wouldn't make any difference to this practice considering payroll counts against a business' profits so wouldn't be getting taxed anyhow. The only catch is for the case of dividend payouts.  The article itself also gives suggestions on how to fix the abuse of the CCPCs, which again, is the issue, not a tax cut for small businesses. Actually any income bracket can make use of CCPCs, just generally not many people know of them and taking advantage of them requires some financial/business/legal knowledge. The 'benefit' for the small business tax cut is the majority of Canadian business' are small (think ~70% of Canadians work for a small business). Most are not abusing the CCPCs to split income (that is generally a very wealthy individual incorporating themselves for that purpose, not actually running a proper business). Further most small business owners aren't all that wealthy.   Now you could make an argument over corporate tax cuts in general (although you tend to want taxes to be low corporate, mid income, high VAT), but the continuing reiteration of your somewhat inaccurate point isn't at all beneficial to any discussion.  I must say I find it somewhat strange that you turned this into discussing your dislike of Mulcair and who you are going to vote for. Neither of those were points I raised."
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,EngSciGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"Hence why wanting it to remain is not a progressive policy.   Please read what I'm saying a bit more carefully.  I do not want it to stay.  I am not arguing for income splitting.  I'm criticizing the fact that this policy offers limited value to people in the middle, but  that it's now being replaced by something that offers the middle even less value.  Only $1B of that $2B program went to the middle class but the business tax cut that Mulcair is replacing it with  benefits the middle and the poor even less than that.   Further any small business tax cut wouldn't make any difference to this practice considering payroll counts against a business' profits so wouldn't be getting taxed anyhow.   Nobody said they would.  The point is that the business owners in this case now have two ways to reduce their tax burden (his tax cuts and the existing income splitting) while the middle class people who don't own businesses lose income splitting and gain no tax cuts, widening the divide between them.   I must say I find it somewhat strange that you turned this into discussing your dislike of Mulcair and who you are going to vote for.   That's  what was being discussed before you entered the conversation and I must say I find it strange that you continuously misinterpret what I'm saying.  Allow me to simplify:  Mulcair is now promoting tax changes that are highly regressive.  I am opposed to this move.   What is it about this that you think is wrong or have doubts about?"
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,Legal420Now,4,Thu Jul 16 03:32:30 2015 UTC,"Mulcair is now promoting tax changes that are highly regressive.   Except he isn't. The current income splitting is regressive. It is being removed. The small business tax credit is not regressive. Statistically a corporate tax cut increases employee wages, especially when coupled with their planned $15 minimum wage. ~70% of Canadians are employed by the ~1.1 million small businesses in Canada, which statistically is going to be a large number of poor and middle class. Also a quick note, many small business are owned by the middle class. You can figure this out easily by the simple statistics;   http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/ref/guides/99-014-x/c-g/c-g02-eng.gif  https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/061.nsf/eng/02804.html   The point is that the business owners in this case now have two ways to reduce their tax burden   Except that isn't how the majority of small business' operate. They aren't shell companies for the owner to institute income splitting with their family members. Those are generally micro-enterprise CCPCs that are being abused by self-employed wealthy individuals. Further since the payout is from being on payroll, which is an expense so exempt from the corporate tax rate anyhow, the cut doesn't benefit these people abusing them. They could get some small benefit from payouts they are making it as dividends but the majority will be as payroll.  Your complaint over the abuse of the CCPCs is certainly valid and so that is where your focus should be. Or you could complain about corporate tax cuts in general, except the general consensus is to aim for tax rates that are {low corporate - mid income - high VAT}.   Edit: Spelling"

Plenty of people who are not wealthy would ebe fit from a small business tax cut. I know some!

Do you oppose that? You want two-time or means-tested healthcare?    cancellation of income splitting, $1B of which went to the middle class.   Trudeau and May also oppose income-splitting. You know why? Because it is a very expensive program that will only provide $1 billion in tax relief to the middle class, while benefiting the wealthiest 10% much more. There are better ways to spend money.   Who said anything about supply management? Beside that, I'm pretty sure all 3 parties support that one.   Then what subsidies are you talking about?     Mulcair's NDP is now saying they'll even sign flawed trade agreements if it helps business.   Really? They did not say this. They said all trade agreements have some pros and cons, which is true. The NDP have been very critical of major trade agreements under Mulcair Nad have not come out for ornagaisnt CETA or TPP because they have not seen the final texts. They did oppose the China -Canada FIPPA, though, and supporters of that deal (such as the Conservatives and Liberals) said it would help business.     The NDP is opposed to legalization (Mulcair believes weed today is too powerful, not like weed from his days, and it represents a much greater risk to health). The NDP is only willing to commit to decriminalization on weed. They will not commit to reforming drug laws in general nor will they commit to even legalizing weed.

Then he's going to fund a daycare program that disproportionately benefits higher income earners too.  Basically, he's cancelling a program that benefited the middle and upper class and using all of the proceeds to fund different programs that benefit high earners and business owners even more disproportionately!

CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,LastBestWest,6,Wed Jul 15 23:48:55 2015 UTC,Can you point out which bits are inaccurate and misleading for me?
CanadaPolitics,3dfbef,Legal420Now,11,Thu Jul 16 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"The NDP doesn't not unequivocally support free trade agreements and does not support TPP.  While some economists have argued small business tax cuts benefits the wealthy more, that's not certain. Regardless, cutting small business taxes has been NDP policy for decades.  His comment about income-spliting is just bizzare. It's quite clear it benefits wealthy households more. All the non-Conservative parties want it abolish it, but /u/Legal420Now claims it's actually a progressive policy and by eliminating a tax break the overwhelmingly helps the rich the NDP are benefiting the rich over everyone else.   The NDP is promising a universal childcare plan modeled after medicare. While it is ture that the rich tend to use universal programs more than the poor, that has nothing to do with the program itself and doesn't mean they benefit at the expense of the poor (or that the poor don't benefit enormously). Healthcare and education are universal programs that benefit the rich more, but no-one says they aren't enormously benefitial to the the poor and that the poor would not suffer the most if they were taken away. Does /u/Legal420Now want to means-test healthcare and public education.   His claim about corporate taxes (which the NDP want to raise) is especially strange in light of his claim that cutting small business taxes is bad. He says the NDP is cowtowing to business because they want to cut taxes for small businesses, but he is attacking the NDP for wanting to raise taxes for large businesses. His point about cororoatebtqxes only comprising 14% of revenues is certainly nonarguemnt for why they shouldn't be raised, it low because corporate taxes are low! Some economics do subscribe to the dubious concept of the Laffer Curve, which argues that lowering taxes results in so much growth that you get more tax revenue. That claim has been debunked in numours studies. However, it is true that corporate taxes are a less efficient way of generating revenue, but that doesn't mean they won't generate revenue or raising them is somehow a conservative policy. If /u/Legal420Now really believed higher corporate taxes produces less revenue, why would he oppose lower small business taxes?   The rest of his links seem to be a bunch of small scandals involving Mulcair and various NDP MPs. They're not worth addressing aside from the claim that Mulcair wanted to join the Conservatives. This is not true. After he left provincial politics he considered an advisory position on the Government of Canada's environmental round table.   However, when he learned the Conservatives had no intention of honoring the Kyoto Accord or moron towards carbon pricing, he ended the discussions and joined the NDP.   /u/Legal420 not,  for whatever reason, is taking contradictory, illogical positions to attack the NDP. There are plenty of reasons to not vote NDP. One of them is they are not left-wing enough. However, /u/Legal420Now is not making a fair or convincing argument from that perceptive. I've pointed out just a few problems with the claims he makes in his link. Moreover, his argument that Mulcair is son different than Layton are also not true, as many others ITT have noted. Layton was a moderate progressive social Democrat, just like Mulcair is (which is probably why Layton recruited him and Mulcair agreed to join him). Mulcair has changed very few policies the NDP had under Layton. The party is remarkably similar today to what it was in 2011.   EDIT: I may add some comments to this post, if I have the time and patience to further develop my critique of /u/Legal420Now's claims. I think I have covered enough to give you an idea of why you should be very cations about taking his claims seriously. However, I have more important things to do than argue on-line and debating /u/Legal420Now isn't all that stimulating or rewarding because he doesn't make honest arguments."

At the time, the Conservatives were down in the polls by anywhere from 5-10% and Trudeau was still enjoying an extended honeymoon. Like all governments the CPC will only call an electing if it's in their best interest or if they have to. I have very little doubt the CPC would have called an early election if they were comfortably ahead in the polls. The fixed election law is kind of a bull shit law and everyone knows it, the idea of having one seems popular in Alberta for reasons I don't understand.   The extended writ period makes a lot of sense. It is undoubtedly in the Conservative's favour since they still have significantly more money. It also helps them silence the various union and advocacy group that's intend on running add against them. At the end of 2014 the CPC had $11.8 million in cash. Compare this to $7.8 million for the LPC or just $2.5 million for the NDP. For these reasons I think the longer writ is much more likely than the early election call ever was."
CanadaPolitics,3dftct,Political_Junky,4,Thu Jul 16 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"and everyone knows it, the idea of having one seems popular in Alberta for reasons I don't understand.   The reason we 'bertans lost it when Prentice called an early election is because it was so obviously timed to take advantage of a crippled opposition. The Liberal.leader had resigned, the Wildrose was decimated by the floor-crossings and had a brand-new leader, and the NDP leader was also quite new.  Harper calling an early election wouldn't be so obviously opportunistic and cynical, but one could certainly make the argument that it is. And that would play onto a well-established narrative about the Harper Conservatives."
CanadaPolitics,3dftct,LastBestWest,4,Thu Jul 16 07:13:14 2015 UTC,"The Conservatives are said to have a cunning plan to extend the campaign this time around for their own partisan advantage. The typical 36-day campaign would limit the amount parties are able to spend to $24-million — a level of expenditure the three main parties can afford with a degree of comfort.  But every day the campaign is extended, that limit is raised by $676,000.   I don't at all buy this argument.  If the CPC wants to drain opponents' finances, then it should delay the election call.  Pre-writ spending is unregulated, which means the spending limit is effectively infinite.  If the CPC has superior finances, then they should wish to delay the election call as long as possible, such that they can own the airwaves against feeble opposition from the other parties.  Even aside from the spending limit, early calls act to the benefit of party finances since much of the in-writ spending is eligible for reimbursement from Elections Canada.  Even if a party does not have cash-in-hand to cover the campaign, this reimbursement allows them to obtain easy bank financing for campaign spending.  If there is a financial reason for a long-writ period, it is in suppressing third-party election advertising.  These groups currently enjoy unlimited pre-writ spending, but they would face essentially crippling spending limits after the writ drops.  If the CPC feels that campaigns like the union advertising drive are hitting the party, then it would be to their advantage to call an early campaign.  (Similarly, there does not seem to be a groundswell of right-wing third-party advertising.)"
CanadaPolitics,3dftct,Majromax,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:19:32 2015 UTC,"There's also the tricky issue of the by-elections, which do currently have spending limits. The CPC hasn't nominated candidates in those ridings, but Elections Canada has said that they consider national anti-Liberal advertising to count against the spending limit, because the Liberals have nominated candidates, and the advertising will reach those ridings."
CanadaPolitics,3dftct,QuizzicalButthead,3,Thu Jul 16 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I'm so tied of this speculation. I really doubt this will happen, especially after what happened to Jim Prentice when he ignored the fixed-election date and called an early election.  Though, I suppose this is a little different as the election date will be the same, but d the Conservatives really want to give the other parties something else to stack them on. Would it be worth it for them for an opportunity to spend extra money?"
CanadaPolitics,3dftct,LastBestWest,2,Thu Jul 16 07:02:51 2015 UTC,"An early writ drop is too much of an inside baseball issue for people to care. The first debate is scheduled for August 6. For all intents and purposes, the campaign will have begun at that point, so why not make it official?"

I don't really think they would be spending extra money. Until the writ is dropped, they're still running ads. But the thing is, if it's a long election period and the limit is $45 million, but the other parties only have, say, $30 million to spend, the CPC is going to have 50% more advertising than either of the other main parties.

Except for the fact that the prolonged event calendar means the amount of money spent by Elections Canada could effectively double.  Elections already cost between a quarter and a half billion dollars each.  A prolonged campaign means that 330 electoral district offices have to open early and be manned, and HQ staff is almost tripled and retained for the duration of the event period.  The public was always reminded of the costs of the election after each one finished.  If people put 2 and 2 together, they'd realize that the Tories are at fault for the tremendous increase in cost for the sole purpose of trying to drain the coffers of the other parties."

If the Conservatives wanted to ""drain"" their opponent's finances, they would drop the writ as late as possible, not earlier.  That's because every dollar spend during the writ period is reimbursed by taxpayers, so political parties ultimately don't bear the cost. If political parties don't have the money on hand, they can easily get a bank loan.  Spending prior to the writ period, however, is not reimbursed. So if the cunning Stephen Harper was really trying to ""drain the resources of their relatively impoverished opponents"", he would drop the writ as late as possible.  An earlier writ would limit third party advertising.  But contrary to the premise of this conspiracy theory, an early writ has no disproportionate affect on any political party - they all have the same spending limits, and they all can expect their election spending to be reimbursed by the taxpayer."

The BOC is just as interested in growth as the Government. But I believe it won't have the same end result as fiscal stimulus.
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,Vorter_Jackson,6,Wed Jul 15 17:42:55 2015 UTC,"Fiscal stimulus only really works when monetary policy does not itself consider the impact of fiscal stimulus.  This means it works in gold-standard economies (where the money supply is limited by shiny metal) or fixed exchange-rate regimes (where the money supply is determined by an outside entity) or for sub-units of a collective monetary regime (like provinces in Canada1 or nations in the Eurozone).  It's much less useful at the national level when a nation issues its own currency, however.  This monetary offset is largely why Canada was able to balance the budget and achieve a surplus in the 90s, since the contractionary effects of reduced government spending (relative to trend) could be compensated for by looser monetary policy.  Some economists such as Paul Krugman think that the ""zero lower bound"" is a case where central banks lose control of monetary policy and cannot ease further.  Others, such as Scott Sumner and Nick Rowe, think that unconventional monetary policy like quantitative easing can still prove effective.  Regardless, simply by lowering interest rates to 0.5% the BoC obviously thinks that it is not currently at the zero lower bound, and when that is not the case the economic consensus is that aggregate demand should be stabilized first at the monetary level.  (The argument goes that government spending is worth it or not in real terms, where a current cost is balanced against public good.  That relationship does not change much based on current levels of GDP; it's not like a new bridge becomes more profitable over 50 years because the economy is depressed now.  That means that the optimal level of public spending is relatively constant over the business cycle for any fixed definition of ""optimum."")  1 -- This is limited because of ""leakage"", where government spending actually increases demand in other provinces.  For example, fiscal stimulus in PEI might not go so well because so much of the province's demand comes in the form of imports from the rest of Canada."
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,Majromax,6,Wed Jul 15 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"Could it be that the Harper governments' effort to balance the budget with cuts (austerity?) is the ""fiscal anti-stimulus"" that is pushing down GDP (creating what could be a recession)?"
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,braddillman,9,Wed Jul 15 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  First of all, the Bank of Canada is still away from the zero lower bound, so at least until today monetary policy should be effective.  This means that at the national level, economic demand shouldn't be too far from where the BoC wants it.  Second, the Harper government has not really run ""austerity"" in a macroeconomic sense.  Notice all the criticism about ""Harper deficits.""  Instead, what has happened is that the federal government has reduced both tax revenues and program spending (relative to trend/share of the economy).  This is not really austerity in the sense that the Greeks have to go through, since taxing a dollar from a private person to spend it on a government program does not directly increase economic demand -- it just shifts it around.  Austerity/stimulus in this sense should be considered in their effect on interest rates.  If the government borrows a dollar to spend on programs, then that borrowing would naturally increase the equilibrium interest rate (since the government would have to compete with all other prospective borrowers).  That increase in the equilibrium interest rate, however, gives the Bank of Canada a bit more freedom to let monetary policy work, which means more money enters the economy.  This is where fiscal stimulus can work from a monetary point of view, and it's roughly why Paul Krugman argues that some countries (I don't think he's spoken about Canada lately) need to run significant, temporary deficits.  If you want to think about fiscal stimulus, think about ""which party would run the largest deficit/smallest surplus?""  The answer here isn't really clear, since although both the NDP and LPC want to see more public spending, they both also opposed the GST cuts that were the biggest hit to the government's tax revenues.  (TL;DR: When you're beginning with a balanced budget, there's essentially no such thing as ""balanced-budget austerity"" or ""balanced-budget stimulus."")"
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,Majromax,2,Wed Jul 15 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Instead, what has happened is that the federal government has reduced both tax revenues and program spending (relative to trend/share of the economy).   But not at the same time. IIRC the revenue cuts were made around 2007 but the budget wasn't balanced until... well, real soon now I guess. So we had deficit spending from aprox. 2007-2015.   So what I wonder is, could the end of deficit spending contribute to our GDP growth slowdown or contraction in 2015?"
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,braddillman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"The BoC cut rates because they don't want credit to contract (they want it to keep expanding). When credit contracts in a debt-based fiat monetary system, you risk the dreaded ""deflationary spiral"".  The system we have only really functions when credit (money) keeps expanding. The problem with this is that you get credit bubbles in areas like real estate. Canadian consumers have also taken on a lot of debt. So at some point in the future, instead of going out to a restaurant for dinner and putting the bill on a credit card, more Canadians will eat at home and pay off the credit card instead.   Obviously there are big losses in the oil sector already (and potentially much more to come). When the housing bubble bursts, Canadians will also be a lot poorer and will have much less discretionary income to spend on consumer goods and services.  So the BoC is trying to keep the party going. They want Canadians to take on more debt. They want the housing bubble to get bigger. They are trying to prop up the debt based economy with more debt. But this is a not a long term strategy. Eventually the bubbles will burst.  Their plan right now is to basically sacrifice the value of the Canadian dollar and try to blow the bubbles even bigger. I suppose they're not necessarily trying to make the bubbles bigger, but they're deathly afraid of the consequences of the bubbles bursting.   So let's say that the plan is to really expand the money supply to prop everything up. Well at some point, consumers will not borrow anymore. There are many consumers who have borrowed too much already and can't/won't take on any more debt. Businesses are not likely to take on more debt because the economy is going to be hurting. So the only other option is for the government to take on more debt. Well, that's great if you're the government because now you've got the economic justification to spend on all the wonderful government programs that were promised during the election.   The big loser in this scenario is the Canadian dollar. Maybe they figure that if they can bring it down to 60 cents or something again... all of a sudden that $1,000,000 house in Toronto is only worth $600,000 US dollars... which is somewhat more reasonable. Your $350,000 downtown condo only ends up being worth $210,000 US which isn't all that crazy.   So that's their plan. But I think they'll fail in their plan. I think the bubble is too big and prices are going to fall, and credit will contract in a big way... and no amount of government spending and bailouts will really be able to change the deflationary trend. They will certainly defend the big 5 banks (they already pre-bailed them out somewhat with CMHC insurance). If this happens, the Canadian dollar can potentially appreciate as people scramble for Canadian dollars to repay Canadian dollar denominated debt.   But the game is up for the BoC. They can no longer pretend that we are recovering and that the rate hike is around the corner. They're getting very afraid of this bubble bursting. The BoC will be as accommodating as necessary and will not defend the value of the Canadian dollar whatsoever. They will champion this as a good thing because now our export industries will be more competitive with a weak dollar. But they only become more competitive in the sense that everyone's wages were cut in half, their pensions were cut in half, etc.  I would be expecting a very sharp decline in the Canadian economy and a dramatic bursting of the housing bubble, probably within the next year or 18 months."

Also, it should be understood that our models 7 years ago were on a 65-cent dollar. We have been strangled by our oil dollar for many years now. Manufacturers can't hold on forever. Our overheads are extraordinary compared to other sectors.  And it's not always obvious that currency fluctuations affect our profit first. When you cut $0.05 out of every dollar in revenue (5%) what's actually happening is that you're cutting $0.05 out of our profit which might be $0.10-$0.20 out of each dollar (25-50%).   TG for this dropping dollar. At parity everything is still more expensive in Canada so we kinda need a weaker dollar to make us competitive in the US market.

Reverting back to manufacturing isn't necessarily a good thing and it isn't even likely to happen because this oil shock is temporary.    We aren't entering some new era of permanent change here, we're seeing a temporary decrease in oil prices and businesses know investing in Canadian manufacturing is a huge risk because the reasons for doing so will be wiped out as soon as oil prices begin to climb again.  Don't expect too many employers to come rushing back to Canada any time soon, especially not with all of these new trade agreements on the horizon now being supported by all three parties.  Manufacturing is dead and based on the policies of all 3 parties, it doesn't look like any of them are actually planning to revive it."

True but that's not likely to happen.  The decline in the CAD is due to low oil prices which nobody actually thinks are now a permanent thing.  Oil prices will go back up and manufacturers will not relocate or set up shop here if they're concerned that the advantages of doing so are going to be wiped out by rising oil prices shortly after they invest multi-million dollar sums into ramping up production.  Chasing after manufacturers is probably not going to be a winning proposition for us.

We are creating a situation where we can't even compete and then giving out tax breaks to make sure we can compete.  If we stopped allowing all of this business to flow to the developing world we wouldn't need to provide those subsidies to make us competitive.

It is this very rise in price that makes Canadian producers and exporters more competitive: the relative ability of international alternatives to sell in both CAD and USD denominated markets is impaired by the amount of the depreciation.  As for timing, there's no particular problem with timing a cut now; this is more an acknowledgement by the BoC's models that the real rate of return on investment at the very short end of the yield curve is below that of the overnight rate.

I'm not particularly familiar with budget politics, but if I'm correct, this means that the CPC will have had a deficit every year they've been in office - even if they've 'posted' a surplus this past year.   If that's the case do you think we'll see the Liberals/NDP/etc. try to point that out to the Canadian public?"
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,Surtur1313,12,Wed Jul 15 15:17:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I thought they technically had a surplus in their first year or two due to a leftover surplus from the Liberals. But this was before the financial crisis.  Either way, I hope the opposition will point out the governments relatively weak handling of the economy (by their own standards). It would be good political strategy assuming Canadians understand and believe it. I personally have been pointing this out to my Conservative friends to try to bring them around."
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,Raklim,4,Wed Jul 15 15:33:16 2015 UTC,"I've heard a few people try the argument out, and its usually met with something along the lines of ""The NDP/LPC would be far worse at managing the economy"". It'll be interesting to see if the CPC does something similar in response. It may be just enough to scare people off."
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,amish4play,9,Wed Jul 15 15:36:42 2015 UTC,"I think their is a legitimate case to be made that the NDP has a certain level of uncertainty in their economic ability simply due to inexperience.  Their is no legitimate case to be made against the Liberals handling the economy. History has shown them as the best economic managers at the federal level. They could actually run surpluses and sustain growth, unlike our current government. Anyone who says otherwise is being intellectually dishonest with themselves."

That's a very safe bet, it's happening already.  To pick on one of the moderators of /r/LPC (/u/Karthan, to ping if you think I'm misrepresenting you and wish to respond with a correction), the lines about CPC deficits and ""largest ever"" debt have already entered the attack lexicon.  The biggest question to me is how well the opposition can manage the tone.  If they do it well, they will successfully portray the CPC as beneficiaries of oil luck rather than competent management, with their current and future budget plans looking like a debt-fuelled giveaway to ""the rich.""  If they do it poorly, they will reinforce the CPC reputation (deserved or otherwise) of a ""steady hand on the tiller"" and raise questions about how they intend to responsibly afford their own spending programs.  The situation in Greece provides both a positive and negative point of reference (even if the economics don't transfer).  On the negative side, the nation looks like a basket case because of rampant accumulated deficit spending; on the positive side the nation looks like a basket case because of the impact of crippling austerity."
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,ChimoEngr,6,Wed Jul 15 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"if you think I'm misrepresenting you and wish to respond with a correction   Nope, you're right on the money.  Conservative fiscal mismanagement has destroyed the surpluses that the Liberals had passed along to them -- well before the 2008 recession. Between the GST cut, cutting taxes, and no managing the affairs of our fiscal structure we've found ourselves in a deficit every single year since Harper has taken over the government.  If you want to look at the communications elements noted in the above paragraph, it's been a ready talking point of the mighty Ralph Goodale, the last finance minister to balance a budget.

Or they may just go for the simple narrative of ""they lied."" We'll see, but I would like to see the CPC's narrative of being good ecenomic managers challenged."

(Table 5.2.8).  So when the Harper Conservatives, Joe Oliver specifically, claim that they're running a budget surplus for the 2015-2016 fiscal year, it's important to point out that their own budget documents prove them wrong."

However, if something goes really wrong with the economy, like say the collapse of the housing market, the gov't will be running the severe risk of gloating about something nobody cares about anymore."
CanadaPolitics,3ddsz0,mageganker,10,Wed Jul 15 14:51:45 2015 UTC,"if the economy was already at the point where the BoC needs to make a rate cut, chances are that the surplus projected in the budget is gone, as that budget relies on growth projections of something like 2.5% for the year, which means we need to get something closer to 5% growth for the next six months in order to meet projections. A slower economy means less tax revenue.  The Bank itself didn't destroy the surplus per se, in fact it will improve the budget down the line, but they would be acting now because the economy is slow, and the slow economy is reducing tax revenue."

It's not like the government goes to the banks to take out a loan or anything. The government issues bonds. They set the terms of those bonds: how long the bond last for, how much interest it'll pay once redeemed, etc.  Said bonds can then be purchased by, well, anyone who wants to.

We originally set up the BoC to loan from so we would pay no interest on our debt but since the 70's we have been borrowing from private banks and since then our debt has only been growing.

We're not exporting as much stuff, so we don't get as many benefits from any possible increase in exports. Interest rates going down ===> cheaper mortgages ===> an already-overheated housing market gets the heat turned up to 11 ===> way more people have trouble buying houses and thereby accumulating wealth in the way you can't do by just renting ===> when the housing market here finally does have a ""correction"" (or, more likely, an all-out crash), it'll be deeper and nastier and more painful. How much of a feedback loop is ""lower confidence in Canada thanks to rate cut"" ===> ""less foreign investment in Canada"" ===> ""Canada's economy goes even lower""?  Yes, I know that a lower loonie might trigger more foreign investment in Canada, but will that part of it outweigh the ""confidence"" side?   Yes, doing a rate cut now rather than later when/if our recession gets worse is probably a ""pro"".  But I'm not at all sure that it isn't outweighed by all the ""cons"" above.

CanadaPolitics,3dfha9,LastBestWest,7,Wed Jul 15 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Avoid cheap shots; they help no one.   There are major differences between the market for child care, which you're alluding to, and the market for pharmaceuticals. In particular, child care is not subject to market failures that public management would solve, which means the only case for intervention is a redistributive one. If redistribution is the goal, it makes little sense to give money to affluent Canadians, who can totally afford child care, rather than to those least well-off.   In pharmaceuticals, the biggest source of market failure is the market power of drug companies, who are the sole providers of patented drugs. There are also asymmetries of information, where patients are often unaware (or refuse to believe) that generic drugs, when they exist, are cheaper and are no less good than brand-name drugs. Government intervention in this market through bulk purchasing and through requiring the use of generics when they're available can therefore improve not only equity in access to drugs, but also general economic welfare. So there is an efficiency case for universal pharmacare that doesn't exist for universal childcare or universal child benefits.   I also talked about the welfarist case for universal pharmacare here."

I'd say the market has failed to provide childcare pretty spectacularly. The case for intervention is to increase supply and lower costs, to redistribute wealth.   There are also asymmetries of information, where patients are often unaware (or refuse to believe) that generic drugs, when they exist, are cheaper and are no less good than brand-name drugs. Government intervention in this market through bulk purchasing and through requiring the use of generics when they're available can therefore improve not only equity in access to drugs, but also general economic welfare. So there is an efficiency case for universal pharmacare that doesn't exist for universal childcare or universal child benefits.   I agree with what yore saying, if what you are saying is there is a strong case for government intervention in the provision of prescription drugs. It may even be stronger than the case for intervention in childcare.  However, that doesn't mean there isn't a good case for government intervention to address the failure of the market to provide childcare."
CanadaPolitics,3dfha9,LastBestWest,4,Thu Jul 16 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"Child care is labour-intensive, and since workers make a lot of money in a rich country (indeed, what it is for a country to be rich is for its workers to make a lot of money), child care is going to be grotesquely expensive. But that doesn't mean there's any market failure in child care that the government could correct. All it means if parents aren't all buying child care is that they're not willing to pay the costs.   With pharmaceuticals, the government has the power to bring down total costs. With child care, all the government has the power to do is tax people and bear those costs itself, or redistribute money to make it easier for parents to bear those costs. It's not as compelling a case as is the case for universal pharmacare."
CanadaPolitics,3dfha9,enfantterrific,2,Thu Jul 16 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"With pharmaceuticals, the government has the power to bring down total costs.   Increasing the supply of daycare would bring down the cost. Look at Quebec and Manitoba. Using government funding power, non-profit childcare can be promoted instead of for-profit. Non-profit childcare has been shown to be more effective and efficient than for-profit.  I'm not arguing that there isn't are very string case for government intervention in the drug market, just saying there is also one for childcare, just like there is for government intervention in healthcare, which is also labour-intensive."
CanadaPolitics,3dfha9,LastBestWest,3,Thu Jul 16 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"Increasing the supply of daycare would bring down the cost.    That isn't necessarily true.  Providing funding for it could also increase demand relative to supply and drive the cost up.   I believe government funding of student loans in the US is responsible for increasing tuition in a similar manner.  The other problem with daycare subsidies is that they aren't all created equal and they don't all benefit the same types of people.    To know if a policy is beneficial, we can't just look at the benefit, we must also look at who it benefits.  The Liberals and Conservatives are tying their childcare subsidies to income so they've got some amount of progressivity built in but the NDP are promoting daycare policies that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.   Non-profit childcare has been shown to be more effective and efficient than for-profit.   That's really interesting.  Could you share that link with us."

Also the NDP and Liberals had asked them to sell those shares back in 2013 or so when they were worth a lot less so it looks like we still lucked out with the current government.

CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,ryanweal,10,Wed Jul 15 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the Harper government cuts to balance the budget are party (or mostly?) the cause of the GDP decrease. Is contractionary fiscal policy contractionary?  I was reading about the Greek crisis, and that in 2008 their debt were around 127% of GDP. After a lot of deep cuts, they drove the debt / GDP ratio all the way down to... 177% of GDP. Their problem was the cuts drove the GDP down faster than their debt."
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,braddillman,7,Wed Jul 15 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't have that strong an effect. It's more likely that investment has slowed and oil price shocks are hurting revenues.  Greece has had far more problems than spending cuts. What really accelerated the Greek crisis is the euro zone. Before the recession, investment and consumption in Greece was predicated on being able to borrow with the rest of the euro zone at 4%. When the euro zone revealed there was no fiscal union and that Greece was actually on its own, their national interest went north of 20%. Imagine if your mortgage payment quintupled overnight. A lot of this scared investors and consumers who feared a loss of income. Fiscal policy is partly the reason for Greece, but austerity is not the reason Greece is anywhere near its current predicament."
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,dmcg12,3,Wed Jul 15 19:19:17 2015 UTC,"I think Paul Krugman would disagree, e.g.   http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/austerity-and-the-greek-depression/?smid=tw-NytimesKrugman&seid=auto  etc. He's written quite a bit about it."
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,braddillman,4,Wed Jul 15 19:57:14 2015 UTC,Greece was running a deficit of 18% of GDP before the crisis and brought that down to a balanced budget. Canada on the other hand cut the rate of growth of the budget. The cuts amount to a couple billion or a few tenths of a percent of GDP. In a nearly $2trillion economy that isn't enough to make a difference and any changes on that scale gets drowned out by the changes in global commodity prices and their effects on the resource sector. The two situations are not comparable because the scale is so different.
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,d-boom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:17:05 2015 UTC,"Your article doesn't even mention Canada so I'm not sure how you can decide he wouldn't agree.    Just because something is observed in one country doesn't make it automatically true in other countries with very different economic circumstances.  Greece's economy was very heavily dependent on government spending (which is why they had these problems in the first place) so austerity would wipe out a lot more economic activity over there.  Canada, being far less dependent on government spending, can eliminate costs without it having nearly as much effect.  Depending on how the savings from cuts are used, eliminating these costs can even have net beneficial effects for the economy."
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,Garbanoonan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"my critique of that is to say ""ok, so how do you plan to balance Greece's budget then?"".  Nothing short of an equalization-style program is going to keep the eurozone together. Greece wildly overspent, got hit over the head by a recession, and then get hit over the head again by the ECB's tight money policy. The question is where do we go from here. Greece does have a spending problem and tax evasion problem it absolutely needs to address. What does Krugman think should be done? Kevin Milligan at UBC has been making this same complaint over twitter. Greece's tax system is ridiculous and that really hurts their economy too, should europe do nothing?  Also, that's one hell of a causation == correlation argument on austerity with that regression."
CanadaPolitics,3de9vk,dmcg12,2,Wed Jul 15 22:05:03 2015 UTC,"Greece and Canada aren't comparable. Greece's GDP was inflated by its excessive borrowing to begin with. In 08' much of their GDP wasn't ""real"" or quality GDP."

Here is my original post in case anyone is interested:  https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/38ey06/according_to_the_harper_conservatives_own/  Canadianbusiness did a great break down of the numbers last week.   Basically they concluded:   Put it all together, and the budgetary outlook has declined by approximately $2.87 billion, exceeding the entire budgetary cushion by a few hundred million dollars.   But the one point of contention I have is that they gave all $3 billion of the ""contingency reserves"" over to balancing the budget. So even with every last possible cushion, we are in deficit. Also, they were basing it on 1.2% GDP growth which has now been revised down to 1%. But I don't blame CB for that obviously, those numbers just came out today.  http://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/now-is-the-right-time-for-the-federal-government-to-run-a-deficit/"

I find it funny that you would say this:   Pretty much everyone suspected this would happen as soon as the price of oil started dropping.    when right now Joe Oliver and Stephen Harper are still claiming they will run a budget surplus. And just a few days ago they were denying a recession.   Also again, your quote:   Pretty much everyone suspected this would happen as soon as the price of oil started dropping.    With all due respect, your analysis couldn't be more wrong. Oil prices started dropping last year. How can you possibly say ""pretty much everyone suspected"" Canada would run a budget deficit since last year?

All three major parties are focused mainly on the wealthy and the middle to a lesser extent, it just happens that the Liberals are now focusing more on the middle than the NDP is.  I still prefer the NDP in a lot of ways but they don't match my values as well as the Liberals do now and it's frustrating because I dislike a lot about the Liberals too."

It's like the difference between watching Olympics hockey when Canada is playing -- go Canada!! -- and when it's just any two countries and you can sit back and really appreciate the skill and root for the team that is actually better, or has the better story.  In 2011 I voted NDP due solely to weighing up the local candidates and deciding which one I preferred.  I have no idea what I'm going to be doing this time.

Sorry, not going to do his research for him and, like I said to him, it wouldn't even matter if it were true because the NDP has abandoned the policies that are important to me.    The amount of lies being posted in this subreddit by people like yourself is now completely ridiculous."
CanadaPolitics,3dgxvb,LastBestWest,4,Thu Jul 16 11:53:32 2015 UTC,"I have voted for the NDP, the GPC, and the LPC at one time or another in provincial and federal elections. I was a long time supporter of the NDP, but I was never a member. After careful consideration I realized that in my heart I am probably far left on the spectrum, but the rational part of me is pretty much dead center, or maybe a bit left, both socially and economically.    The CPC has never been an option for me. The CPC, and its predecessors, seem more concerned with entrenching what we have rather then improving it, although the RPC did have some good ideas that their contemporary counterparts seem to have left behind.   The NDP has good intentions, but they either think it is a virtue to stick to their ideals rather then represent their constituents (Jack Layton), or they go the opposite direction and abandon their ideals to shamelessly reach for votes in the center(Thomas Mulcair/Andrea Horwath). Also, I am concerned about how they weigh the severity of problems against each other, such as the environment vs the economy, or security vs privacy.    So, basically I believe that incremental improvement is the best way forward for Canada, and the LPC has always been the party of incremental improvement. The LPC is also the party that has had the biggest role in creating the Canada we live in today, which may not be perfect, but it is one of the best societies on the planet; they deserve a good portion of the credit for our relative prosperity.   That being said, I do not agree with everything they stand for, and I am not a particularly huge fan of Justin Trudeau, but that's OK. No party is tailored to every member. In any party you are going to have dissenting views; it is your job to fight for what you think is important within the party. I don't agree with everything, but the LPC are the closest fit for me.   History is full of examples of what happens when change is too fast, and also what happens when societies idealize a mythical past. Slow, steady, pragmatic governance that is cautiously looking for ways to improve is what I want, so I chose the Liberal Party of Canada."
CanadaPolitics,3dgxvb,Iustis,2,Thu Jul 16 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have to generally agree with your conclusion.  I wish there was a true left wing and practical party I could support.  But the Liberals are the next best thing.  They may not shape Canada to my vision, but I feel they will improve it.  I would even be ok with a fairly radical NDP, but too often modern left parties are unwilling to take the 'bad' of their ideology (taxes etc.) with the good (big social programs and reform).  Even when they do they go with bad taxes on the 'other' in this case corporations."
CanadaPolitics,3dgxvb,Rihx,4,Thu Jul 16 06:15:45 2015 UTC,"Even if everything you believe about the Mulcair is true (I say it's not), the NDP is still on the whole less ""neoliberal"" than the Liberals and the Greens. Mulcair not wanting to raise personal income taxes this election and Trudeau wanting to raise them for some (while cutting the for others) will not make the NDP more ""neoliberal"" or ""right-wing"" than the Liberals. Parties are bigger than their current leaders or this election; their histories, membership, and ""brands"" (for lack of a better term) shape their characters and ideologies more than a single leader at a specific point in time. That's bit to say leaders and their policies don't have an effect, they do, but simply that the leader is not that party. I mean, just look at the kind of candidates each party attracts. Left-wing author Linda McQuaig is running for the NDP in Toronto Centre against the Liberals' Bill Morneau, the former head of the actually neoliberal think tank, the C.D. Howe Institute. There are more examples, but this one is the most stark.  I'd argue even the Greens are to the right of technology NDP and Mulcair, although not as much as the Liberals are. For example the Greens' star candidate in Guelph is a former supporter of Ontario PC Premier Mike Harris. May herself was an advisor to Brian Mulroney. I don't know how most Greens feel about that, but I'm sure many are okay with it because a focus on the environment is more important to them than left-wing or right-wing policy. They're an eclectic bunch that doesn't have a set ideology (perhaps even less so than the Liberals), and are united solely on a focus on environmental policy.  Having said all that, and getting back to your question, you can still be a New Democrat whether you like Mulcair or hate him. People in the same party don't agree on everything; that's what makes leadership elections and policy conventions interesting! You could be an anti-Mulcair NDPer who votes NDP this election or you can be one who doesn't vote or votes for another party. Do you know who's running for the NDP in your riding? Have you factored that into your thinking. Instead of bemoaning Mulcair and some of his policies on Reddit, why not contact you local NDP candidate and say you have some problems with some of the policies the party has proposed. If you really have been a loyal New Democrat and care abut the party, you could also join it and have a say in crafting party policy and chosing  (or removing) the leader. You don't have to be a passive observer."
CanadaPolitics,3dgxvb,Dan4t,0,Thu Jul 16 17:50:45 2015 UTC,"Even if everything you believe about the Mulcair is true (I say it's not)   The only reason you could say it's not because you still haven't looked at the links I've given you that confirm it's true.  Looking at that evidence will take care of your doubts but something tells me you have no interest in looking at information that conflicts with what you want to believe.   Mulcair not wanting to raise personal income taxes this election and Trudeau wanting to raise them for some (while cutting the for others) will not make the NDP more ""neoliberal"" or ""right-wing"" than the Liberals.   Trudeau is raising taxes on income above $200k and redirecting that money to the middle class as tax cuts.  Mulcair is promising not to raise taxes on the wealthy and is not giving the middle class the tax cuts that Mulcair is.  He is, however, going to give out business tax cuts that only really benefit the wealthy.  Trudeau and Mulcair will cancel income splitting, but only Trudeau is replacing it with a different tax cut that disproportionately benefits the middle class.  Trudeau's child care policies also give cash to parents based on their income while Mulcair's is a general subsidy that will be utilized disproportionately by the wealthy.  I have also given you links for this but I guess you have avoided reading that one too.   you can still be a New Democrat whether you like Mulcair or hate him.   I agree, however, I personally have chosen not to be a New Democrat because they are no longer the best choice to represent the middle class and the poor.

You just don't seem to understand that subsidies do not need to be direct cash disbursements to taxpayers to count as subsidies.  Funding childcare spaces is still providing a subsidy for childcare services. and the problem is that their method of subsidizing these costs results in higher income earners gaining disproportionate benefits.  Trudeau's method of tying cash disbursements to income ensures the funds do not go disproportionately to higher income earners.  His method of subsidizing child rearing expenses is far more fair.   See, you don't even know what you are arguing against.    Oh god, the irony."

This is such a non-issue that means nothing.    Debt can be used to increase economic performance in the long run so anyone harping on about deficits without looking at debt-to-GDP, GDP growth, job figures, etc. clearly has no idea what they're talking about.  Deficits mean absolutely nothing without context, and when you add that context, it could be very easily argued that we should have been using more debt, not less.   lso this is the first time the US grows while Canada isn't   Yes, because of oil prices... which would have happened regardless of who was in charge.

How does that help at all?  The core of the complaint is that wealthier people are more likely to own businesses and therefore more likely to benefit from small business tax cuts.  This doesn't change by limiting it to businesses with a certain number of employees."
CanadaPolitics,3ddbbi,EngSciGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"Well the change avoids the potential abuse by scenarios that I suggested, which is what makes up the majority of those owned by wealthy individuals, as the article discusses for the majority of the write up. So not allowing the tax break to be used by wealthy individuals using CCPCs as a tax avoidance would 'solve' the problem (and be possible to 'detect' by employment numbers).  I am some what confused by the statement in the article;   is that it doesn’t have good economic impacts because small business deductions contribute to a wall of taxation, so if they grow, they lose some of their benefits and get hit with higher taxes…. It tends to keep small businesses smaller.”   So a business will refuse to grow if by growing their profits get taxed a bit more?"
CanadaPolitics,3ddbbi,TheHonStephenHarper,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"So a business will refuse to grow if by growing their profits get taxed a bit more?   It depends. As it is, businesses lose a significant amount of tax advantages by transitioning out of ""small business"" status. Not only is there a higher tax rate, but they also lose several tax benefits that aren't available to non-small businesses. The result is that by growing your business, you can actually make less than you would by staying the same size.   For example in Manitoba if your business has an income of less than $425,000, they have a 0% tax rate. If they make $425,001 they have a tax rate of 12%. Without taking into account the difference in federal rates and other tax deductions that are exclusive to small businesses, a business would have to increase income to $481,000 just to be at the same place as a business making $424,000.  Here is a paper on it if you want to do some more reading on the topic."

Even if the election date wasn't fixed, there would have been rumblings of one already and based on the polls, the NDP would be aware that they could form the government.

There is a difference between dismantling an existing system and creating a new one. In the case of health care and education, I accept that the social good of providing universal care and education within the current parameters is worth the cost. Here in BC, I make a means-tested contribution to my health care, and I think that is OK, as would some kind of means tested user fee to discourage abuse of health care resources. For primary and secondary education, I hold a similar view (and similarly pay a whole range of means tested fees and supplements).  For early childhood education/care, I would be open to including it as part of the education system if it could be done at a realistic cost. In that case, it should be truly universal, without the regressive rationing effects inherent in the existing system in Quebec or that proposed by the NDP.   Also, means-tested programs are usually anathema to progressives    I am not one of those progressives who finds a means test abhorrent.  I already have to ""prove"" my level of income in order to qualify for all of the tax benefits I may or may not be eligible for.

Yes. The rich benefit disproportionately from all universal programs, but it's not at the expense of the poor, they are just more likely to take advantage of these programs.   People who attack the NDP's childcare policy from this angle (which includes some Liberal MPs) are really being disingenuous, unless they also advocated abolishing free, universal  public healthcare and education in favour of a meas-tested system in which the better off cannot partake or have to pay extra."

It's a bit of both. Let's just use an example, say that I make $150,000 and my partner could make $60,000. With two kids in Toronto, daycare might cost upwards of $30,000 a year, so my partner would essentially be working for minimum wage. I'd probably choose to have him/her stay at home.  Now, let's implement the NDP's policy - daycare now costs $7,500 a year for two kids. It's now much more worth it for me to send my partner to work, since the net income is $52,500 rather than $30,000. My family's benefit of $52,500 is much greater than a low-income family's benefit of $22,500.  Edit: I failed at math here   Or is this benifet inherent in the form of daycare subsidisation that the NDP is proposing and that another form could be more targetted?   That too. A simple fix would be to cap daycare costs at a percentage of income. For example, if we cap it at 10% of income over $30,000 per child, I'd still be paying the $30,000 annual cost of childcare with my high (hypothetical) income, while a low-income family would pay little to nothing.

That it benefits the rich more because it allows people to work more and rich people make more money? Really? That has nothing to do with the content of the program.

CanadaPolitics,3ddbbi,amnesiajune,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:11:39 2015 UTC,"How is this a bad thing?   The way the NDP is proposing the plan (without means-testing or a corresponding tax increase), it indirectly subsidizes the disproportionately larger benefit to the wealthier family.   And why would the incentive for wealthier parents to work be higher than the incentive for poorer ones?   Let's compare two families, one where both parents earn $60,000 and another where one parent earns $120,000 and the other earns $60,000. They each have two kids who need daycare, at a cost of $1,250 per child per month or $30,000 per year. Under the NDP, daycare costs $15 per child per day, or $7,500 per year (assuming 250 days of childcare)  For family #1, sending the second parent to work currently represents a 50% increase in their income - it means that dinners out will be at Montana's instead of McDonald's and family vacations will be in Naples, Italy instead of Naples, Florida. So they're currently very likely to have both parents working. The NDP's plan gives them a benefit of $22,500, which represents a 25% increase in their income after childcare.  Now, let's look at family #2. Sending the second parent to work isn't as valuable to them, because the same salary - not much more than minimum wage - provides less of a relative gain but the same stress of work and dropping off/picking up your kids. They're not as likely to have the second parent working. Now, with the NDP's plan, that same job effectively pays $52,500 rather than $30,000, so it's now a lot more likely that parent number 2 will go work, providing an income increase of $52,500, or 43.75%.  So there's a good comparison - two families, one making three quarters of what the other makes, and yet the higher-income family gets a much larger relative income gain."

If the problem you perceive is the benefits are greater for families with higher income, and your proposed solution is means testing it so it only benefits the poorer family, I don't see how that is increasing the benefits that the poorer family receives. You're just eliminating or reducing the benefits the higher income family receives.

Also it's objectively stupid to change single law about nudity, and replace it with dozens of laws detailing where and how you can sit if you are naked, in order to make sure you are not a safety hazard.  Even from a libertarian ""bureaucracy is literally hitler"" stand point, it makes no sense, because it makes the rules complex. Here it better to make an outright ban and then come up with exceptions."

All the other religions were regarded unfavourably by less than 30 per cent of Canadians, and those who see Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism in a good light far outnumbered those harbouring suspicions.   In the rest of Canada, those who found the thought of a son or daughter marrying a Muslim unacceptable shot up to 32 per cent from 24 per cent.

CanadaPolitics,3depbr,FeelTheFlow,5,Wed Jul 15 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"What the DSF doesn't seem to understand is that with or without oilsands expansion, emissions from fossil fuel use will continue to rise as long as the demand for that oil exists.  Yes, oilsands produce marginally more emissions than other parts of the world, but the majority of emissions in the lifecycle of crude oil are actually during combustion (around 70%).   If these premiers can agree to lessen the regulatory burden on pipelines, while also working to better integrate regional electricity grids and develop more stringent climate policies, it's a win for everyone involved.   Hint to DSF - that's exactly what the Canadian Energy Strategy is doing..."
CanadaPolitics,3depbr,prageng,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with this analysis by DSF. You don't reduce outputs by increasing activity and streamlining delivery methods.  The Canadian government has already acknowledged that we're not going to meet our 2020 reduction targets.  http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/politics/canada-failing-to-meet-2020-emissions-targets-1.2223930  To fast track pipeline development in order to increase the amount of bitumen that Canada can export strikes me as nonsensical given the worldwide momentum for change to address climate change described by DSF.  To persist doggedly in an expanded focus on fossil fuels at a time when other countries to whom Canada would sell its bitumen are taking active steps to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, strikes me as willfully ignoring that the landscape is changing.  Following is a recent article describing the vigour with which China is shifting its focus: http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/15/3659355/china-coal-use-drops/   While China is rapidly pursuing clean energy technology — with solar growth that dwarfs any other country — and also closing hundreds of coal plants in response to domestic air pollution issues and a shifting fossil fuel landscape, the real reason for the dramatic fall in emissions is likely the country’s sluggish economy. So far in 2015, China’s economy is growing slower than the government’s desired 7 percent pace — a trajectory that puts it on course to have its weakest economic year in a quarter of a century.   But while China’s economic growth may turn around, its coal use will not. Late last year the government announced it plans to cap coal use by 2020, a necessary target to meet its global pledge of peaking greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Reducing its use of coal, which still generates three-fourths of China’s electricity, is also a key element of China’s renewable energy target of 20 percent non-fossil fuels in “primary energy consumption by 2030.”   This next link goes to very impressive efforts underway in India to shift away from fossil fuels/step up their use of renewables while improving the quality of life for their citizens. Their challenges are many given how underdeveloped they are as a nation and they'll clearly need the support of the rest of the world to continue making the already impressive inroads they've made into renewables. What strikes me about this article is how much their energy strategy is focused on renewables already and how very much they are talking about the importance of expanding their use of renewables.   http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/09/140919-india-modi-renewable-energy-science-world-wind-solar/  The above sources are two among many that describe impressive efforts by other countries to wean themselves off fossil fuels. Given this shift in attitude worldwide and, with oil prices remaining stubbornly low, I'd expect Canada to get in step with where the rest of the world is headed. We, too, need to start shifting our focus, in earnest, away from fossil fuel extraction and toward development and implementation of renewable sources of energy.   What's becoming increasingly clear to me, the more I learn, is that everyone needs to do their part and the developed world, given our higher standards of living, need to lead the way. Limitless economic and population growth that relies on fossil fuel extraction and transportation is simply illogical. As this DSF article eloquently lays out, the planet simply cannot sustain it.   The reason there is demand for fossil fuels today is that development of renewable alternatives has not been supported enough to make them as widely available. Just because people look for energy sources does not mean that they're choosing fossil fuels as a solution. Government, all governments, have a critical role to play in supporting our global society's transition from the old to the new world energy strategy. The faster Canada makes this shift in mindset in a meaningful way, the better off we'll all be. Pouring time, effort and resources into an energy sector that's becoming increasingly passé is simply eating up valuable time and effort that could be applied to solutions that are the way of the future."

Have the federal government own and put in the pipeline. Rent it out to pay for maintenance/upgrades/surveillance for leaks.

The big issue to me isn't just protecting consumers - it's also protecting the drivers. A huge problem with Uber's model IMO is that they shit on drivers by calling them ""partners"" rather than employees. That means they don't get any rights or benefits. Use the Spotify thing as an example - Uber told their drivers ""If you want business, you have to let people stream music in your car, and you have to pay for the membership and the data usage. Oh, and by the way, we're reducing fares indefinitely so you're gonna make 20% less."" The result was that a lot of drivers make significantly less than the American minimum wage, and that's completely legal because being an ""independent contractor"" strips them of all their workplace protections. (As a side note, the journalist from that story actually became an UberX driver, and found that she made just $9.36 an hour).  ""Taxi companies in Toronto and other Canadian cities are subject to a raft of regulations from which Uber is exempt. Taxi drivers, for their part, have typically shelled out vast amounts for one of the limited supply of official taxi plates, an expense Uber drivers are spared.""  That's a minor issue. A taxicab driver's and owner's license here in Toronto cost $650 and as little as $500, respectively, according to the city's website. The bigger difference between the two are the other regulations. Taxis have to be equipped with several cameras that protect the passengers, as well as a hijack warning system that protects the driver. You also need to have a car big enough to comfortably seat four passengers (source) and a proper commercial insurance policy, not the subcompact with personal insurance that most Uber drivers use.   Steamwhistler's TLDR: Uber is trash for workers and replaces one exploitative system with an even more exploitative system."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,steamwhistler,11,Wed Jul 15 01:47:23 2015 UTC,"Those licenses are given out here and there, and you are lucky if you apply for one and actually get one in your lifetime. Many taxi driver licenses are bought and sold in an unofficial market for hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the area of operation that particular license covers. People with this license will 'rent' it to people who want to be drivers for a huge daily fee. Thats why taxi drivers tend to work insane numbers of hours, as they need to cover a huge flat fee  (license fee) before they themselves make any money."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,abacabbmk,15,Wed Jul 15 12:16:53 2015 UTC,"Although I agree that uber may exploit drivers when it comes to wages the ability and flexibility to pickup a few hours of work with an assist that is just sitting in a drive way has value as well.   Although there are regulations on cabs it's been my experience all across Canada and the USA that cans are most likely much more poorly maintained compared to uber and lyft cars I've been in.   I've had cabbies try to rip me off by taking longer routes, have cars with no speedometer, try to add all kind of bs surcharges, no room in the trunk when picking people up at the airport. Never mind the jn ability to get a cab at any price during Christmas party season or poor weather.   Lyft and uber although not a final solution seem to be on the right path to solve some mobility problems and can address the false shortage created by the limited licence system. Pretending that the current system is fine isn't a solution.    Of course we're only ~20 years away from all the cabbies being unemployed."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,Gears_and_Beers,5,Wed Jul 15 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"I've had great experiences with Uber too, but they haven't been around that long to compare them fairly to traditional cabs. Will Uber drivers be able to afford new cars in 5 years when theirs start breaking down, or will you start getting Uber rides in clunkers? Will drivers have the spare cash when an emergency comes up and they can't work for weeks? Time will tell."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,bhearsum,3,Wed Jul 15 12:06:24 2015 UTC,"The real issue for Uber will be how their service evolves. I've barely been using them for a year, but they've dropped fares (and thus driver income) a lot in that time, changing most of their drivers from people with free time to full-time drivers in generic cars, which is really no different than cabs. That'll be their biggest problem - how to keep fares low while stopping the declining service quality."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,amnesiajune,12,Wed Jul 15 12:46:19 2015 UTC,"I've had cabbies try to rip me off by taking longer routes, have cars with no speedometer, try to add all kind of bs surcharges, no room in the trunk when picking people up at the airport.   All of that happens with Uber too. Drivers still pull off similar tricks as well as new ones that a traditional cab doesn't allow. You can ask for it to be corrected, but that only works if the driver is so blatantly cheating that the fare falls well outside of a normal range.   Never mind the jn ability to get a cab at any price during Christmas party season or poor weather.   Extreme price gouging (what Uber does) isn't any better. If you ask me, it's a lot worse. If you call a cab, you'll have to wait but it's still first-come-first-served."

Otherwise, the supply is too low in many circumstances. That corrects for this.   Another brilliant aspect is the ability to rate your driver.

CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,Borror0,10,Wed Jul 15 02:21:45 2015 UTC,I don't mind the part that pays drivers more to get them out. I mind the part where Uber doubles or triples their profit on the back of a public transit outage or a big rainstorm. There's a reason why that first part is legal but the second part isn't.
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,amnesiajune,9,Wed Jul 15 02:24:33 2015 UTC,"While there's a reason, I do not think economic populism should dictate policy. It appears unkind but it's terribly efficient of a solution to deficient supply."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,Borror0,14,Wed Jul 15 02:39:05 2015 UTC,"What does Uber's increased net income during a demand shock accomplish? It doesn't increase the supply of Uber downloads or the availability of server connections in response to increased demand. It just pads the company's pocketbooks when customers are vulnerable.  I wouldn't mind it if the driver got 100% of the increased price - that's an acceptable economic solution to demand shock. But the costs at Uber's Head Office aren't increasing, so the amount they make shouldn't be increasing either."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,amnesiajune,6,Wed Jul 15 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"Drivers do get the vast majority of the profits, if not 100% of them. That is how it increases supply. As far as I know, Uber charges a percentage so it goes both ways. When demand is low, it also makes less. It's not a one-sided profit mechanism.  Maybe you think they should instead charge a flat rate. I'm not sold. That would impact shorter fairs unfairly or, if they correct for price surge, does not strike me as significantly more fair."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,Borror0,3,Wed Jul 15 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"That's not what I think at all. I'm fine with them charging twice the rate, as long as 100% of the extra fare (what wouldn't normally be charged) goes to drivers.  Let's say that Canadian Tire usually sells bags of salt for $10, with a profit of $4 per bag. After an ice storm, they want to get more salt for customers, so they tell producers that instead of paying $6 for salt bags, they'll pay $15. What's the ethical, legal price for Canadian Tire to charge for those new, more expensive bags of salt? $19, or $25?"

CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,Palpz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"What does Uber's increased net income during a demand shock accomplish?   Drivers get alerts for surge pricing, then come out to make some extra money. This brings online more supply for customers.   There are drivers who only drive during surge times. Savvy ones will know where big events are happening, and will be available.  I've seen 19X (yes 1900%!) surge pricing, in the states after a big event, most of that goes to the cabbie."
CanadaPolitics,3dbk6s,amish4play,2,Wed Jul 15 13:38:56 2015 UTC,"Again, this is accomplished by giving more money to the driver, not by increasing Uber's net income after profit.  To recycle an analogy, let's say that there's a snowstorm and Canadian Tire, which previously bought salt bags for $6.00 and sold them for $10.00, wants to increase their supply to make up for increased demand. They could tell their suppliers ""Instead of paying you $6.00, we'll pay you $15.00"". That's fine, since it provides a greater supply, and it's perfectly reasonable to raise the price of that salt bag to $19.00.  What's blatantly illegal and ethically questionable is for Canadian Tire to then say ""since demand is way up, we'll increase our profits too. So instead of charging $19.00 to make up for costs, they charge $25.00 and increase their profits by 150% thanks to the snowstorm. This is how Uber's surge pricing work - they pay drivers more to get them out, but they also pay themselves more. That doesn't serve any economic purpose, it's just a greedy abuse of vulnerable customers."

To use your analogy, if Canadian tire restricted their sandbag inventory to conform to some regulation, in exchange for a stable predictable profit or monopoly position, then it would be indeed unethical for them to charge extra, however this is not the case with uber. Uber enjoys no protections and has no obligation to restrict their profit making.   People are still free to use the regular taxi service during surge pricing as well, if they can find them."

I would say that domestic politics are the main driver behind Pres Obama's delaying of a decision on Keystone. Those domestic issues are focused around the oil sands being considered an environmentally damaging source of fossil fuels that should be left in the ground by a significant portion of the Democratic party base.
CanadaPolitics,3ddw45,amnesiajune,3,Wed Jul 15 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"Others are going to say that Obama is intentionally delaying Keystone in order to appease the Democratic base, but this is more an ideological reading of events than anything else.  Obama has consistently stated that the pipeline has to go through the regulatory review process just like any other project (meaning he's waiting for the final State Department review to be completed).   Now, it's true that he might expedite the review in some way if he wanted to, but there's no need for him to spend political capital on a project that (in his view) might not actually be needed given the significant amount of increased oil production seen in the US in the past five years. In other words, he's not intentionally delaying the project, but he isn't favouring it in any way either.   This, along with other factors - namely state-level court challenges and a significant increase in commentary on the project (which the State Department is required to respond to), are really causing the delays.   As to your other questions about whether oil produced in Alberta is better for the environment than oil produced in Iran, it's difficult to say. Oil is a global commodity, so if there is more produced in Iran for the global market, less will be produced elsewhere (current situation notwithstanding). Similarly, if Keystone was approved, and even more oilsands crude was shipped to the US Gulf Coast, the current oil they are importing there from Venezuela and Mexico would be shipped elsewhere. This makes it difficult to say what the change in environmental impacts would be in these different cases. Alberta oilsands is one of the ""dirtiest"" crudes currently under mass production (I'm using ""dirty"" as a synonym for greenhouse gas intensive), so a reduction here would likely be better in those terms.   FYI, in general, crude produced around the world is less greenhouse gas intensive than oilsands crude produced in Canada, even including emissions from shipping.

This is true, this whole debate about the Niqab being worn in citizenship ceremonies is a non-issue (though I lean towards having the face uncovered during the ceromony).  More than the actual issue the politics of this are very interesting. It's easy to see why the CPC would want this to dominate the headlines. I'm going to be using this EKOS poll data for some of my points   The CPC base is pretty homogeneous on this. With 79% of CPC supporters stating they don't think the Niqab should be worn during the ceremony it's a unifying issue for their base. It's an incredibly divisive issue for both the opposition parties. 58% and 62% of Liberal and NDP voters respectively are opposed to the Niqab being worn clear positions either way will upset a large amount of each party's base. Public opinion in general is on side with the CPC. 64% of Canadians believe the Niqab shouldn't be worn during the citizenship ceremony. Any time a party can get 64% of the population on side with their stance with all the other parties on the other side of the wedge it is a huge win. This data isn't given in the EKOS poll but I suspect this is a winning issue in Quebec more than anywhere else. The CPC has made huge inroads in Quebec and this will bolster that trend.

CanadaPolitics,3dbr25,Benocrates,11,Wed Jul 15 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"It seems like the accused's Twiiter account was blocked from contacting the complainant's. So I don't think he continued to contact her. (Maybe I'm wrong though.)  Simply mentioning a person's username on Twitter will cause the Twitter platform to inform that user of the ""mention"". The complainant demanded that the accused stop mentioning her. I don't think anyone has the right to request that.  Perhaps when you have a block on an account, Twitter should stop telling you about ""mentions"" originating from that account too.  Edit: in the case of the ""subtweets"" the complainant would not have even seen the offending tweets unless she sought them out."
CanadaPolitics,3dbr25,Benocrates,7,Wed Jul 15 16:16:26 2015 UTC,"It's interesting to think how this would turn out if a public figure instructed news media to stop referring to them. Would repeatedly calling out and accusing someone in a public forum of wrongdoing be tantamount to criminal harassment? I think that leaving notes on their doorstep would, but broadcasting it to the nation would not. I guess the question we are left asking is whether or not Twitter is more akin to a doorstep or a national/global forum."

CanadaPolitics,3dbr25,PetticoatRule,15,Wed Jul 15 17:02:15 2015 UTC,"It said the details, really it's as petty as they made it sound.   But the relationship soured after a video game appeared online showing the face of a woman who could be punched and bruised. Guthrie, like many others online, took exception to the game and used Twitter to protest the game and its Ontario creator, Ben Spurr. “I want his hatred on the Internet to impact his real-life experience,” Guthrie wrote on Twitter in July 2012. Elliott felt Guthrie and others were ganging up on Spurr and unleashed a series of tweets saying so. Guthrie blocked him from communicating with her on Twitter, but she could still read tweets that mentioned her user name. Shortly after, Elliott created the Twitter hashtag #FascistFeminists in relation to Guthrie and her friends. One of Elliott’s final tweets involving Guthrie was in response to another person calling him a “perv and a sad little man.” He answered: “You are wrong on all counts. Go listen to (Guthrie) play her s--- music in crappy bars with your loser faux-feminist friends.” The tweets from Elliott didn’t stop until his arrest in November 2012.   This is from another story that details it more.  But he didn't threaten her or sexually harass her and she even blocked him and he seemed to be countering personal attacks with personal attacks.  Why this even went to trial I can't even fathom."

If any one is guilty of harassment it's Guthrie for trying to affect the every day life of the jerk who created the video game in the first place.

Usually employed for negative or insulting tweets; the person you're mentioning won't see the subtweet in their Twitter timeline as it doesn't contain the @ symbol that every Twitter username has. Someone wants to criticize a person with the username @JohnDoe on Twitter but without that person seeing the tweet in their Twitter timeline. Instead of tweeting ""I think @JohnDoe is an idiot"" they would subtweet ""I think JohnDoe is an idiot"" or ""I think John Doe is an idiot"". In each case the @ symbol is missing so the tweet would not appear in @JohnDoe 's Twitter timeline.   In order to even know a subtweet about you existed, you would have to actively search for it, or be subscribed to the poster's Twitter feed."

Nothing really stops the LPC from stealing some of the thunder from any CPC plan to increase the basic personal exemption income level by offering some level of it as well or by offering it first. Either party could attempt to match what the other is offering as long as funds can be found.
CanadaPolitics,3dbwiw,Hoarse-horse,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:36:02 2015 UTC,I wonder what the LPC policy is going to be for low income people.   Mincome pilot and a WITB boost IMO.

Just including their affordable housing, child care, and foreign aid policies is $20B a year  ($5B + $5B + $10B) and the NDP plan to pay for it with income splitting ($2B a year) and corporate tax increases (if Erin Weir is right to assume zero behavioural changes when raising corporate taxes one point of CIT is $1.5B a year) of 7 points only would produce, in the best case with unreasonable assumptions, $10.5B a year. Seven points is likely more than Mulcair wishes to raise taxes, what does he do about the other $7.5B a year?  The thing is that $7.5B hole doesn't even to begin to describe it. Throw in their small business + manufacturing plan and that becomes $11B unfunded. Add the health care escalator and it's $12B, add transit and city spending it's $16B... you get the idea.  JT has actually said where the $2B ""unfunded"" is coming from.

In it, Justice Major almost makes a mockery of CSIS's incompetence:    Surveillants were unable to distinguish one traditionally attired Sikh from another. When the CSIS surveillance team observed experiments involving a test explosion carried out by Sikh extremists in the woods in Duncan, B.C., in June 1985, the loud sound was misinterpreted as a gunshot. No photograph was taken of the unknown third person present because the surveillants had not brought a camera.   There was serious conflict between CSIS and the RCMP, but it didn't kill all those people. It only let some of their killers go free. They disagreed on whether their job was to collect admissable evidence or to collect any evidence at all.   A department of external affairs official testified at the hearing that he'd received a briefing that a plane would be attacked that week, and he'd passed it over to the RCMP, who told him they already knew about it. Justice Major accepted his testimony, but he was savaged by the government's lawyers on that point and the document itself never ever turned up, Bartleman couldn't identify where or who it might have come from.  So, to summarize,    that's a complete fabrication. CSIS didn't know there was a bomb on that plane. They didn't know much about anything, by all accounts. I think Justice Major used the word ""bumbling.""  CSIS and the RCMP made a hash out of the ensuing investigation by refusing to cooperate. That's not because laws prevented them. It's because of petty squabbling and power moves.    I was a toddler in 1985. I am of Indian background. This makes me feel sick.

Once interest rates go back up to where we'd like to keep them in a more normal world, amortizations could be loosened up a bit (max 25 years if you ask me, but then again not sure why you would ask me as I'm not an expert)."

Making massive debts easier to take on is not the way to solve inequality, because it puts way too many people at high risk of default. Also, this approach would hopefully gradually lower home prices or at least slow their rise."
CanadaPolitics,3d9hkl,insanity_irt_reality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:01:55 2015 UTC,Yes it would lower home prices. By restricting supply not by increasing supply. The exact opposite of what you want. Even with a 15year mortgage vs a 25. It still costs 200$/sqft or so to build.
CanadaPolitics,3d9hkl,Himser,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"The exact opposite of what you want.    I would disagree - if we are concerned that a housing bubble is pricing those who are not rich out of the market, then I would say we would want housing prices to either lower or at least moderate their growth. I don't think there's any way we can expect wages to keep up with the incredible growth housing prices seem to continue to enjoy, and it's going to be increasingly untenable for many Canadians who want to buy a home.  But I'm interested in your perspective - why do you think lowering home prices is the exact opposite of what we want? Do you think that builders would not be able to make a profit if home prices were to moderate a bit?"
CanadaPolitics,3d9hkl,insanity_irt_reality,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"I think restricting supply is the opposite of what you want. Generally if you really want housing to drop in price you need to increase supply, the fastest and cheapest way to do this is to loosen up municipal zoning bylaws to allow everyone to build higher density. By lowering the time limit for loans you both would stop house price increases (at the expense of raising rents) but also slow down any density increases. Due to lack of people able to buy at all.   However you may get smaller condos out of the deal that people may be able to afford. (if again municipal bylaws were changed to allow higher density)"

Given that, it's unlikely the NDP, nor Liberals, would follow a different course.   If you think that by electing an NDP government, you're electing a socially democratic government that is going to radically change things, think again. The NDP recognize that they'll have to govern from the middle which means that tinkering with the affairs of private corporations is verboten and not going to be taken to kindly.

CanadaPolitics,3d9wmt,Trivesa,9,Tue Jul 14 21:15:45 2015 UTC,"Actually the article talked about it at the end. It wasn't that it was considered a threat, they were worried about recruitment of expatriates. I guess that could fall under diplomatic faux pas, unless embassies are allowed to try and recruit foreign workers? Honestly not clear on what the 'rules' are for that kind of thing.  It honestly comes across that they wanted a reason to kick out the embassy (and pull out our own) and just ran with the first thing to come up."
CanadaPolitics,3d9wmt,gunju11,2,Wed Jul 15 03:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, so we're in agreement then - the report that the CBC was referencing did not cover anything to do with Iran's embassy in Ottawa.    Honestly not clear on what the 'rules' are for that kind of thing.   It's frowned upon because the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations forbids diplomatic stations from interfering in the domestic affairs of the host state. When Counselor Mohammadi urged Iranian-Canadians to ""occupy high-level key positions"", ""resist being melted into the dominant Canadian culture"" and stated, ""By 2031, the total immigrant population of Canada will increase by 64%, and the number of Iranians will increase due to birthrate. So, therefore, we need to put into effect very concentrated cultural programs in order to enhance and nurture the culture in this fast-growing population. It is obvious that this large Iranian population can only be of service to our beloved Iran through these programs and gatherings"", he defied Canada's interpretation of the Vienna Convention.    It honestly comes across that they wanted a reason to kick out the embassy (and pull out our own) and just ran with the first thing to come up.   Well, no. We've had problems with this scam before with the Government of Djibouti and the Tamil Tigers. At first glance, this looks like nothing but a cultural outreach initiative. The regime gets information about the immigrant's family in Iran which they then use for leverage. Some regimes (the two that I mentioned) will do it for cash, others do it for favours and/or information. Either way, it's unacceptable and a security risk."
CanadaPolitics,3d9wmt,Political_Junky,7,Wed Jul 15 04:25:53 2015 UTC,At which point you follow diplomatic channels to get them to cease those actions. Kicking out the entire embassy is a childish level of diplomacy. The only group it hurts is Iranians working/educating here and would likely become future expatriates as they would want to remain in Canada. Somewhat ironically the removal of the embassy actually achieves some of what Mohammadi stated by simply resulting in fewer Iranians leaving Iran to become Canadian.

We know this has a huge impact on people now. Mental health is a real thing.   Often, we hear about productivity gaps in Canada. We're just not as productive in X area. We also see, notably the public sector, get accused of abusing sick leave etc.   Well, maybe some of the lack of productivity, and some of those sick days, could be addressed by getting Canadians the mental health tune up they need.   We talk about how we need engineers to design and maintain new amazing technology. These are well-paying, good jobs.   Why aren't we talking about the mental health fields, which help maintain and fix our employees? We fix the machines, but not the operators. Not to mention many of those fields are not only in shortage, but are woefully underpaid, such as Personal Support Workers (PSWs)  If you're suffering depression, or an anxiety disorder, or even something as common as seasonal affective disorder, you're likely taking more time off than you would otherwise.

I'm not even talking about just money (though I do want to know how much it would cost). Right now, anyone can pretty much immediately get an appointment with a therapist. Presumably, funding therapy would mean more patients for the therapists. Would there be a waiting period, and if so, how would you deal with it? I would think that only people with doctor referrals would be funded, but would you actually turn away people without a referral, like psychiatrists do?"
CanadaPolitics,3d9ji2,QuizzicalButthead,2,Tue Jul 14 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"Excellent points.  In some places, there aren't enough therapists (I'm thinking especially reserves/remote/rural/Northern areas), so part of the strategy would have to include spreading them out a bit.  Yes, funding therapy would mean likely a pretty big increase in demand, so we'd have to work on the supply generally.  And it might be possible to have it so that medicare only covers it if it's a doctor referral, but not if you just go pick a therapist yourself ... but then, how many doctors will just go ahead and do the referral even if it's not ""really"" necessary?  There are definitely lots of pieces to this puzzle."

It's the same thought train that gives us ""Tough on crime"" minimum sentencing and the removal of actual rehabilitation programs."
CanadaPolitics,3d9ji2,topazsparrow,2,Tue Jul 14 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"It's not just the lack of finances, the system needs a complete overhaul. The amount of readmissions in acute and long term mental health units is very high. In the nearest city to me, there is a wait list for detox, and a wait list for rehab. The government will pay for 4 days of detox. The problem is people will detox, but then there are no beds available in rehab. That person gets sent home, and has to wait. The thing is, by the time they've got a bed in rehab, the person has more than likely relapsed, and now needs detox again, but there's (you got it) no beds! The cycle continues.   I've heard staff blame it high rates of readmission on the mental illness; basically stating non-compliance with treatment is due to the illness itself. But these medications can make you feel worse than being psychotic - the tremors, fatigue or insomnia, increased hunger, no sex drive. They can literally kill everything that makes us feel alive, and leave a person as a shell of their former self. The community resources are a joke with long wait lists and lacking finances. The government found out a little too late that is was cheaper for people to be treated in the community than at a hospital. Now we're clawing tooth and nail to establish programs that should have been put in place 25 years ago.   Now let's talk about the ER departments. The staff are not equipped to deal with mental illness; it's not their area of specialty (that's not meant to be insulting). They're already overrun due to the lack of primary care physicians in the community. A person who comes in to the ER just has to state ""I'm fine, I feel better"" and they will discharge them. They do not have the time to convince someone they need help, nor do they need a person holding up a bed who may or may not need it. It's a recipe for disaster.   Some of the issue has to do with the stigma surrounding mental health, and the rest is poor planning and lack of resources.   The mental health system is a nightmare for the patients, the patient's families, and the staff. I could add so much more to what I've said, but I'm at work."

I've been through an addiction rehab, plus a lot of other mental health issues, myself, and while I've been very fortunate to get the care I've gotten and to not have ended up in a lot worse shape, I know that for each one of me there are 999 others out there who desperately need help."

A couple of my teachers didn't upgrade, and the only impact was they can't receive tenure at my school or be in control of their course content.   I want to upgrade to the RN, which will take me 3 years full time after this program.   I'm sorry to hear about your Mom. Do you remember if she graduated from a hospital based nursing program?

Telling people they need to wait three to four months to see a psychiatrist when they're coming to the doctor in crisis just doesn't work.   Pouring more money into the system probably isn't the answer unless the system is fundamentally changed so that the limited supply of psychiatrists stops acting as a chokepoint in the system.

But depending on the time and place, it would be attributed to ""laziness"", ""nerves"", ""the vapours"", ""women's issues"" (look up the root of the word ""hysteria""), or perhaps to demons, to ""the effects of sin"", or any number of other things.  Also, many such people probably self-medicated with alcohol, tobacco, qat, coca leaves, whatever psychotropic ""medications"" were available.

CanadaPolitics,3d8nfp,Vova_Poutine,16,Tue Jul 14 12:13:23 2015 UTC,"The high percentage of projects being announced in Tory ridings can partly be explained by the fact that most of the announcements to date have come from a subsection called the Small Communities Fund. That section is worth $1-billion over 10 years and can go only to communities with populations under 100,000.  The Conservative Party has generally had more success than other parties in winning rural ridings, particularly in Western Canada and Ontario. The program has also been particularly slow to roll out in Quebec, which is home to many rural ridings held by the opposition NDP.   So most of the early funding is going to rural communities, probably because those projects are a lot less complicated to get off the ground.    Since this demographic is largely conservative, I think this is less a case of ""fucking grade-A unfair bullshit"" than it is of complaining far too early about a programme when only about 6% of the projects have been announced."

I wish they had included these projects in their analysis. The CPC has 53% of the ridings, so the spending is only 13% out of wack.

Most of the projects announced are smaller projects which tend to be in more rural or smaller centres.   I couldn't Google a number but I'd be curious what % of land mass does the conservative ridings cover in canada? Smaller city ridings are more likely to have projects that cross into other boundaries. Major roads tend to be the boundaries so something like an overpass or light rail improvement would not count.   Is there any proof that projects more worthy in non conservative ridings are being passed over for other less worthy projects? Is anyone willing to claim that Fort McMurray doesn't need an airport expansion?   How about some evidenced based conclusions rather than massaging the data filters in to get a headline that gets clicks.

CanadaPolitics,3d8sqg,CanadianJohnGalt,14,Tue Jul 14 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"Unions, like charities, should be banned from political actions or else they lose their tax exempt status."
CanadaPolitics,3d8sqg,RegretfulEducation,67,Tue Jul 14 12:57:44 2015 UTC,"These exemptions have different legislative purposes.  The Supreme Court has noted multiple times that trade unions have throughout history been intimately involved in politics; advocating for improved work-related laws is part of their very function.  Furthermore, as far as I am aware unions do not solicit for donations from the public.  This is obviously a limited resource; the ban on charitable exemption for political activity comes from a desire to prevent charities from being used as a tax-advantaged front for unlimited public lobbying.  Additionally, a public sector union launching an ad campaign also has a proprietary interest, in that they're attempting to influence the public opinion of their employer.  In a very broad sense, this is no different than Unifor launching a public relations campaign urging a boycott of (say) Ford until the labour contract improves."
CanadaPolitics,3d8sqg,Majromax,15,Tue Jul 14 13:09:01 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing an argument that Unions should be blocked from Politics.

CanadaPolitics,3d8sqg,Meth-Damon,20,Tue Jul 14 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"It's just such a undefendable position.   It is a defensible position, but it's not currently the law of the land.  The ""unions should not be involved in politics"" argument comes from a very sensible place that a union's job is solely to bargain for its workers, and it must do so in the confines of the employer/employee relationship.  Action designed to influence the public at large becomes less permissible as the influence becomes more vague and as the dispute ventures further from an active labour dispute.  For example, ""general strikes"" are broadly not legal in Canada, since a bargaining unit can only legally go on strike when there is no active collective agreement.  On the other hand, as I mention somewhat one-sidedly, the history of the trade union movement is intimately political.  Much of its early 20th-century foundation is intimately connected to socialist politics, and there was and is a free flow of people and ideas between the union movement and ""revolutionary"" socialism.  In this context, the interest-group of a trade union is not just the narrow bargaining unit, but all workers in a collective sense.  So in terms of what the law is right now, statutes and courts recognize the political role of unions.  Given that recognition, banning them from political activities would be inappropriate.  (Regulating them as any other political actor, such as with third-party advertising limits applicable to other interest groups, would make a great deal more sense.)  (Pedant's note: I have enough neoliberal leanings to be sympathetic to the argument that neither unions nor charities nor political donations should be tax-exempt in the first place, but that's a bit different.)"

Well, no, they don't have to solicit donations from the public. Or anyone. Because they're allowed to simply levy their dues upon people who fall within their bargaining unit. Whether any individual in that unit likes it or not.   The mandatory nature of that is why I consider political activisim by unions to be unacceptable. It's an injustice for someone to be forced to choose between either quitting their job or allowing some of their paycheque to be used against their political interests.  This is IMHO especially egregious when we're talking public sector unions. The notion that in order to work for the government, you have to be willing to help finance a campaign to defeat a certain party is just plain wrong."

Corporations can lobby and run independent ads advocating for a party's victory or defeat, but then all of its employees must allow some of their labour to be used against their political interests.   But it's not theirs by that point. They've been duly compensated for their labour via their wage and benefits package. Once someone pays you in exchange for something, it's not yours anymore; you don't get a say in what they do with it.   A more apt comparison would be that of the shareholders, whose money it actually is at that point.   The main difference that I see being that, well, if you don't like the direction that a company you've invested in is taking with regards to political activities, there's far less of a burden to sell those shares, perhaps invest elsewhere, than it is for a worker to find a new job.    Even outside of politics, unions can and do work against the interests of individual workers for the collective interest of the bargaining unit. If I were unionized and my union decided that vacation time is more important than a pay increase, I do not have the freedom to negotiate independently -- I'm left with quitting my job or allowing some of my paycheque to be used against my workplace interests.   Well, yes. I personally don't consider this to be an argument for allowing unions to work against a member's political interests, I would consider this to be an argument against requiring workers to be a memebr of a collective bargaining unit.    This is an inevitable sacrifice with a collective bargaining model. It's probably not ideal, but unless we have a better way of equalizing bargaining power between management and employees then it may be the second-best option.   I agree it is most definitely not ideal, and would grealt prefer a system whereby people would be free to pick and choose who represents them in their negociations with their employer. This would allow those workers who want to be part of the union to be part of the union, without forcing other workers who don't (or who would like to be part of a different union) to unfairly support the former group simply because there's more of them than the latter."

Unions lose their leverage in negotiations when they don't represent large swaths of the workers. If we take the federal government as an example, how would your model work? How many hundreds or thousands of unions would employees be subscribing to? Would TBS have to hire legions of collective bargaining negotiators to meet the demand? Furthermore, internal mobility would be drastically reduced, because pay and benefits packages would no longer change all together. Furthermore, would pay and benefits changes stick to the job or to the person? For example, let's say person X works for 6 years as a policy analyst in division Y. They don't like the big unions, and are represented in negotiations with TBS by a much smaller union that collects less dues and doesn't conduct political activities, is generally less active, and has acquired much less substantial pay and benefits improvements over the years. It being the modern working world, the person decides they'dd like to leave for another policy job in the government with more seniority. That job has been represented by a more traditional union that charges more in dues, is much more active, and has been much more successful at bargaining on behalf of their members. This person is now benefiting from all those additional dues paid. Is this fair?  The point is -- unless everyone is equally contributing to unions, it's not fair for would-be free riders such as yourself to enjoy the benefits the rest of us paid for.  Your proposed solution doesn't seem workable, but I'm all ears to how you think this could actually work."

Unions only deserve solidarity to the degree that the people they represent actually support them.  I understand that the status quo is better for the unions; but I don't really care about the welfare of the unions. The fact that they unfairly benefit from the leverage granted to by dint of the workers who they represent despite those worker's not actually wanting to be represented by the union is something I would like to eliminate.    If we take the federal government as an example, how would your model work?    Essentially a slightly simplified manner as any currently non-unionized workforce is managed. Individuals or groups of individuals can negociate their pay, benefits, and working conditions accordingly. Less than one in three Canadian workers are members of a union, but those places where unions are not in place still manage to run well enough.    That job has been represented by a more traditional union that charges more in dues, is much more active, and has been much more successful at bargaining on behalf of their members. This person is now benefiting from all those additional dues paid. Is this fair?   Why would that person benefit? Again, to point to non-unionized workplaces, just because Joe bargains well and gets a raise doesn't mean that Phil, Alice, and Lilly get one too.   The free rider problem is best eliminated not by making every pay, but by not giving people a free ride."

The status quo is also better for employees. How exactly can an employee in the public service bring leverage to bear on their employer? That employer has a massive pool from which they can replace that person if necessary, why would the employer ever give them a raise? And if nobody gets any raises, then we all get poorer because we all lose ground to inflation.  Unions exist in order to strengthen workers who otherwise possess little leverage over employers - this is more relevant now than ever in an era of low economic growth and a weak jobs market with lots of hungry people willing to work for less. Weakening unions is only good for employers, and I suppose for the minority of union members who have a problem with how unions spend money."

The status quo is better for employees who agree with what the union is doing.  It is not better for those employees who don't agree with what the union is doing. It's better at getting what the union is asking for, whatever that may be.   I don't have a problem with the concept of employees banding together to bring leverage to bear on ther employer. They should be free to exert their influence accordingly.   But they should not be free to exert other people's influence just because a plurality of the coworkers want to exert said influence.   Solidarity should only exist to the extent that the people being represented actually support the position taken.   If someone doesn't want to play, is willing to lose that leverage, they should be more than free to do so. They should also be free to exert what leverage they have in an attempt to get something else."

In case you missed it, here is just a fantastic example:   Goss joined Tim Melton, chairman of Melcor Developments; tech company NPO Zero's CEO Ashif Mawji; CEO of Clark Builders Paul Verhesen; and CEO of Keller Construction John Cameron, to express concern that a change in leadership would spell disaster for a province already hurting from drops in oil prices.  ""This is no time to be making a change to an unknown commodity. We don't need amateurs running this province through difficult times,"" said Melton.  Mawji said he is worried companies like his will be unable to attract young talent without being able to sell them on the low income taxes in the province. He also said the hit to large corporations from potential corporate tax hikes from the NDP will translate to reductions in corporate charitable donations.  ""If there's no bottom line, then there's no money that goes to charities. We won't make donations to charities,"" Mawji said, using the Stollery Children's Hospital and the University of Alberta as examples of where the losses will be felt.   Please, oh please, continue to encourage 'big business' to talk.   It's a great way to showcase who these people really are. Donald Trump might be the loudest, but he's far from unique at those industry heights.   Unions talk about the trampling of collective bargaining rights (which are legally enshrined), and the impact of 'austerity' measures on the workers they represent.

Unions, just like businesses, are not people and should not have a meaningful impact in a democracy. This is a logical exstension of the logic behind barring Unions and businesses from making political donations. If theyre allowed to advertise themselves, then barring them from donating is pointless.

Because of this proliferation of accounts I'm more inclined to ignore Twitter and use Facebook. Facebook you can generally tell if an account is bogus or not.  Also social media is not supposed to be a platform to argue on policy. It's a tool to motivate your supporters. You convince people to support you and your social media is the end location for them where you keep them up to date. People intentionally try to disrupt this and dissuade supports away from a party/candidate. Facebook pages allow a better set if tools to ban users.  This is all very cynical but it's a constant battle online. If you want to know your candidate it's still best to have a conversation with them.  BTW this is all pretty much lifted from an Australian campaign strategist who helped Abbott and Cameron win, and is suspected to be helping Harper. He's got a seminar on YouTube, I'm on mobile but Google should be able to find such a niche topic."

CanadaPolitics,3d8x6f,UnionGuyCanada,14,Tue Jul 14 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"If this hadn’t been posted, I was going to post it because I really like the article, probably for all the wrong reasons. I grew-up in Quebec in the 1980s but, like many, I came and went with relatives who couldn’t find work or were concerned about the rising tide of nationalism and was fortunate to have grown-up in a number of places, among others, the United States. During the 1980s and early 1990s, America held a distinct advantage over Canada – before the Liberal tax cuts, Canadians could waltz across the US border and immediately watch their salaries rise by 20 or 25% while their taxes would drop by 30 or 40%. It was a no-brainer. Why live in Montreal and pay so much (for so little) when you could relocate to greater Boston or New York?  But, a lot has changed. The gap has closed between Canada and the US. You no longer have to go to Plattsburgh or Buffalo to get impossible to find goods that are unavailable here. Salaries in big Canadian cities are on-par with their US counterparts. I remember getting into the car with the family, driving to the US to shop at the wild and wonderful Wal-Mart. The border guard knew we were hauling more than our allotment, but they were doing it, too, so they’d look the other way.   Like I said, a lot of that has changed. Sure, somethings in Canada are more expensive, but we have access to everything that they do. We’ve closed the gap in so many areas and have built a big and wonderful country. So, what the hell is Norm’s brother talking about?   Direct democracy? Free delivery? Sure, Washington and Colorado have legal pot, but a heap of political, administrative and legal issues to wind through. While it might be nice to piecemeal a marijuana plan, doing it all at once is a much more comprehensive way to securing and finalizing plans. While voter initiatives can be great exercises in democracy, they can also be double-edged swords. California’s Prop 13 has been widely criticized as habituating financial problems in the State of California. Governments who wish not to make contentious decisions can enable voter initiatives that can either be gutted by legislatures, or accepted, despite their impact on minority groups (The State of Maine, at one point, had more voter initiatives than any other state, enabling players like Angus King and Baldacci the option of steering clear of contentious projects. Maine, for comparative purposes, is about 1/30th the size of California). The idea that these direct democracy actions are better is debatable, and I don’t think makes democracy “stronger” in the US or “weaker” in Canada.   I get the point of the article: often, there is a lot of needless criticism of the United States that doesn’t really take into account the reality of the US, or it’s people, but I feel Norm’s brother is presenting a very unidimensional argument to sustain his belief, which can be so roundly rejected that it does more harm than good. Presenting a weak argument for something, no matter how noble, enables detractors to gain a strong position. I usually like MacDonald, but feel this article fell flat."

CanadaPolitics,3d8x6f,greengordon,23,Wed Jul 15 19:16:18 2015 UTC,"My iPad is wired to the U.S. Apple site. Mom's tablet forces her into Apple's Canadian corral for the customary fleecing everyone ""up there"" seems to endure with such fatalism.   This one is at once easy and complicated.  The easy part is that we do have arbitrage for physical copywritten goods like books because of resale -- one can physically go to the US, buy a bunch of books, and resell them here.  The easy half is to ensure that a similar practice is legal for electronic goods.  Cross-border movement of an e-book or TV show or movie, even for commercial purposes, should be legal provided the copy was valid in the country of origin.  The hard part is that some of the restrictions are corporate in nature.  The publisher that holds the national copyright is only going to allow Apple to sell the US version and the Canadian version and the UK version separately, with separate pricing schemes.  This in theory could be an anti-trust issue (where the US publisher is authorized to ""export"" to Canada but doesn't), but Canada would have to prosecute under US law.   But I've also come to understand the power of ordinary American voters, especially those with compelling ideas who get behind ballot initiatives or legal challenges or political movements.  An example: like Americans, most Canadians don't regard possession of cannabis as worthy of prosecution. The difference is that because of voter activism, recreational cannabis consumption is now legal in four states, and, in dozens of others, possession is treated in the same manner as a traffic offence.  In supposedly progressive Canada, meanwhile, even simple possession remains a crime nationwide, and the government actually had to be told by the Supreme Court that medical marijuana users have the right — not a government-conferred privilege — to consume the drug as they please. Even in cookies.   Bullhockey.  First of all, criminal law is written at the federal level in Canada and at both the state and federal levels in the US.  Voters in BC can want marijuana all they want, but BC cannot make possession legal because Canada has one single, solitary criminal code.  This is a strength, not a weakness.  Second of all, despite the legalization efforts recreational cannabis is still illegal in the US, under federal law.  The federal government chooses not to give priority to enforcing this law in states where possession is legal, but the situation is not as ""rainbows and cookies""  as this article alleges.  Finally, medical cannabis use is permitted Canada-wide because of that Supreme Court ruling; this is not the situation in the United States, where many states still criminalize medical cannabis.   Another example: In this country, when you need an elective medical procedure, you can get it done in a few days, rather than a few years. Even if you're indigent or on Medicare.   ... no.  Someone who is indigent is certainly not getting an ""elective medical procedure"" done, at least not unless they're covered by private insurance and can afford the co-pay or deductible.   Since Obamacare became law, the number of uninsured Americans has dwindled noticeably.   ... and because of that previously-lauded ""democracy,"" many US states have refused to extend Medicaid coverage to the not-quite-destitute, leaving a tremendous gap in insurance coverage.    Americans work harder, give more to charity — far more — than Canadians, and there is a touching reverence here for public service.   *snerk*.  If anything, the civil service is held in disdain in much of the US.  I see far more ""DMV"" jokes originating from the States as I do from Canada, and even law enforcement has a more tarnished reputation.   Neighbours of mine regularly go to Reagan Airport in D.C. to cheer the arrival of aging veterans, most of whom roll through the arrivals section in wheelchairs. ""Honour flights,"" they're called.   .... oh, by 'public service' this author means 'military service.'  Right.  The US does lionize its soldiers, but on the flip side this makes reasonable public debate about the proper use of military force a great deal more difficult.   American exceptionalism remains a licence to trample through the affairs and even territory of other nations.   ... case in point.   It also seems unfair that America's rapacious banks nearly destroyed the world's economy eight years ago, and that now its economy has recovered much more quickly than everyone else's.   This is insulting to both the recession and recovery.  Foreign banks were just as culpable as American banks (and notably Canadian banks did not run into solvency issues), and America's recovery has been far from swift.  Even in relative terms, America's recovery is only swift compared to that of the Eurozone, which committed a few own-goals on monetary policy.  (Namely by being entirely paranoid about inflation whilst unemployment was high)   As well, the tolerance for guns here, frankly, borders on insane.   Insane?  It seems almost a given from the combination of direct democracy and the military-fetishist warrior culture.   And the level of Christian moralizing in political discourse, with all its spoken and unspoken implications, still makes me uncomfortable.   Democracy!  You can't get away with championing its excess when it agrees with your position on cannabis and lament its excess when it disagrees your social policy positions.   The best of America — [...]  the passion over the rule of law   Wait, what?  This ""passion over the rule of law"" that has led states to effectively nullify federal cannabis law?  This passion that supports American exceptionalist foreign policy that operates with only loose reference to international norms?  This passion that leads to tolerance of extremely discriminatory legal outcomes for trivial offenders who happen to be poor and/or a racial minority?    If anything, America has very little tolerance for ""rules are rules"" arguments.  ""Rule of law"" means that a society is predictable even if it is temporarily not ideal.     The best of America — [...] the brash disregard for classist etiquette, the unrivalled transparency of its economy    ... presented for contrast with   The economy seems to require a permanent pool of subsistence labourers, none of whom seems to be Caucasian.   Classism in American does not operate in the UK style, with old money and new money being separate from both each other and the working class.  Classism in America functions along economic lines, but it is if anything equally strong.  Look at /r/trashy for just where these largely-economic distinctions are soundly mocked here on Reddit, or any joke about fat people in people-movers at Walmart.  This is also still unfortunately and intimately connected with race and immigration.  The American experience of a poor non-white immigrant (legal or otherwise) is very different than that of an upper-class white citizen professional.  The latter can exercise America's fabled democracy and ""transparent economy"", the former has it exercised upon them."

Medicaid is the state-run healthcare for the poor, Medicare is federally-run healthcare for (mostly) the elderly.  In many US states, qualifying for Medicaid as an adult is quite difficult, and simply being a poor adult without children is insufficient.  Moreover, I'm also docking the article points for ""elective medical procedure.""  Depending on just what is meant, elective procedures would not be covered by Medicaid.  If you're interested in some details, you can see one table summarizing the prior approval requirements for Medicaid-funded hospital admissions."
CanadaPolitics,3d8x6f,Majromax,4,Tue Jul 14 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"You're right, I meant Medicaid. But in many states it's not that difficult to get covered.

The operative word being ""if"".  I think it's unquestionable that the US health care system provides more timely service to people who have money directly or via sufficient insurance, but it does not provide a good model for how to import the ""timely service"" without the excessive money.  If Canada spent the same fraction of GDP on health care that the US does, it would stand to reason that we would have an extremely timely medical service as well."

CanadaPolitics,3d8x6f,mikeyo73,8,Tue Jul 14 16:35:20 2015 UTC,"Wait times in the Canadian model seem to be caused almost exclusively by more patients wanting/needing a procedure than there are resources to provide it.  If Canada increased funding by 70% (see Canada at 10% vs US at 17%), then there would be a much greater supply of health services.  We may still not have great rural coverage, but this is equally a problem in the United States.  Since ""throw more money at it"" is both a trivial and uninformative solution.  If we're looking for a system change then we should look more at the United Kingdom (9.1%) or Germany (11.3%) or Norway (9.6%) for inspiration -- nations that have different (some better, some worse) outcomes at very comparable levels of spending."

Wait times in the US have a weird distribution; if you have cash or insurance, wait times are really short, but if you have neither, then wait times are infinite.

Some states have implemented laughably low income thresholds to qualify for Medicaid.  For example, in Mississippi, adults who don't have dependent children at home don't qualify no matter what their income is, and parents only qualify if their income is less than $462/mo. for a family of four.  That's $5544/yr.  So a family of four with an income of $6000/yr., which would equal $3/hr. for a full-time job?  The kids would be covered, but not the parents.

Criminal law that can imprison people is not something that we should take lightly.  The idea that conduct can land you in jail in one place but not in another across an essentially arbitrary jurisdictional line makes the law itself more arbitrary.  This also avoids jurisdictional disputes.  US criminal law might be better if states had full criminal jurisdiction, but that's not the case -- both states and the federal government have criminal powers, leading to conflicts such as on marijuana law.  Since inter-state offenses are properly at the federal level, it makes the most sense to locate all criminal law there."

A lot of judges and similar positions in the states are elected, and make very political rulings.  Even the unelected judicial positions tend to be politicized - and in a similar vein their decisions are often derided/insulted/protested by those who disagree with them.  For example it would not be hard to argue that the recent gay marriage decision of the SCOTUS had shaky constitutional foundations - and this was not helped by the very political/flowery decision written by Kennedy.

I think the difference is that Canada has a largely unified interpretative framework for statutes and the constitution, whereas the United States does not for constitutional law.  Essentially all constitutional questions here get resolved with the purposive approach, which means than even when dissenting arguments are constructed they're following the same ground rules.  In Obergefell v. Hodges, the disunity of approach was extremely visible.  The majority used a framework that wouldn't be too strange in Canada, whereas each of the dissents had originalist leanings.

This one is very fair, and it's a ""supply side"" feature that Canada really should look to adopt.  Some of it may have to do with Federal securities regulation, some may be related to interprovincial trade, some may be due to tax difference, some may be due to Canada's more oligopolist market structure, and some may be a simple accident of geography and population density.   Really hard (but probably worthwhile!) to tease out where the relevant differences lie.   Other things. Free speech is very much taken seriously.

But it's a real advantage the US has. I suspect some of this the Canadian government can't fix - meaning the US just has, and will always have, more wealth, and a bigger consumer base.   But I've mentioned many times here that it's really hard in Canada to make real wealth as an entrepreneur as compared to the US."
CanadaPolitics,3d8x6f,ECoast_Man,6,Wed Jul 15 00:34:41 2015 UTC,"Tell me, is there anything in the American system that you think is good, anything!?    Interstate freedom of trade and federal control over the securities industry.  Combine that with a better transportation network (not so much a feature of the system as of population density), and it's easier to start an American business that goes national.  Aside from that, however, much of the salient differences are not so much American successes as Canadian failures.  Taking health care as an example, we have as much to learn from Britain or France as from America.  Some of the Canadian problems are straightforward.  Access to Information is a notable example here. The current state of affairs is bad, and the solution is to stop being bad at it.  We don't need reference to another nation's model, we just need to stop sucking at fulfilling our own commitments.  Some American successes are also almost accidental in nature.  The US has a better understanding of just what a proper national defense costs, but it does so in the context of an underlying imperialist rhetoric that sometimes borders on military fetishism.  Speaking specifically of the political system than the more nebulous economic system, the US provides a better negative example than it does a positive one.  The US congressional system encourages deadlock almost moreso than compromise, it is extremely unrepresentative, and it is vulnerable to pork-barrel projects and micromanaging.  It is only manifestly superior in de-centralizing some power away from the elected head of government, but other nations are also capable of reaching compromises here without the vulnerability to deadlock.  The conflation of the society and the politic is the problem here.  We can imagine many things we want to emulate about New York or Los Angeles, but about ""America"", in its entirety?  What possibly applies equally well in Boston as in Topeka?  The problem is that the United States is big.  Talking about the United States writ large makes only slightly more sense than talking about Europe.  Articles such as this one look at and lionize (or, to be fair, deplore) one particular aspect of American society.  Here, Neil Macdonald talks about the good points of ultimately a (mostly white) middle to upper class life in America; this is not the experience of a poor racial minority or illegal immigrant.  That's not Macdonald's problem per se, but it does mean we should question importing American systems and ideals without consideration: sometimes we'll get the bad with the good.   I don't get the criticism of the article. He presented his case but also reaffirmed the problems throughout America.    No, he has a few reasonable points, but much of his case is built through rose-coloured glasses.  His problems in many instances directly contradicted his salutary points, such as where he championed direct/local democracy and activism but decried the religious influence.  ""The passion of America is great, except for that bit where their passions conflict with my values.""  I'd much, much rather look at the lessons we can learn from America -- or any other country -- rather than things we should emulate.  Only the former lets us improve on our role models, rather than at best ape their successes."

They would see themselves better integrated, more accepted in Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto. The violent crime rate would be much lower.

No need to be condescending once again, I'm born here and have lived here for decades. I'm not talking about immigration to here; I'm saying if you teleported a foreigner instantaneously from their location to here or there. Do you seriously think there is that much of a world of a difference between these two great nations? I see more difference between any two countries in Europe that one could pick. You never got to the first point. I've been there several times and the people there are wonderful and I've seen many places that are comparable to Canadian localities. If you love Britain so much then move there, or fight for merging our country back in. Meanwhile, I'll continue to be proud of this great sovereign nation with a seat at the UN, an Olympic team, a space program, and everything that makes it as sovereign as the US is from Britain.   Like America, I want every legislative vote to be free, I want a Republic, I want a Canadian version of the amazing Interstate system from sea to sea, I want their fixed election dates, I want an elected Senate, I want equal Senators for each province, I want a Senate that can reject motions unrelated to confidence (that is real ""sober second thought""), I want a completely codified constitution, I will call judges an esteemed ""your Honor"", I want pride in the fact we are detached from Britain, and everything else that America does that could be considered worthy and fuck whatever objection you have to that.   Thanks, I already took high school social studies and did well on it years ago; I know what a parliamentary and presidential system entails.   There's a big difference between de jure and de facto. In the case of the US, people have perverted the system from its original intent. I am talking about the system in theory here. I am not arguing at all for a transformation into a presidential system; I'd rather we improve our current one using some things from them. Their filibuster used to be actually going up and talking for hours on end as in here. Likewise the concept of confidence here works in theory but with the concentration of power in the PMO it's worth squat in a majority government (until that's changed). We have the worst of both worlds right now. You didn't answer what to do if you like the MP but hate the leader. Concentration of legislation from the cabinet reduces the relevancy of the MP and really makes backbencher an appropriate name, for now. In the US, Obamacare was introduced by the representative Charlie Rangel, for example. Secondly, you can't filibuster in the House of Representatives as maximum time for each rep. to speak is set before each debate.   Last time I checked both countries have an amending formula. 3/4 of state legislatures there and 2/3 provincial legislatures here and with approval by the national legislature in both countries. We can talk about how it's much more challenging to change a constitution there but that's once again a reflection of their toxic and moneyed political climate. I remember that one time when a man with support from Alberta and Quebec tried to change our constitution... We both have Supreme Courts, striking down odious legislation, but, to save you the time, I am aware of the living tree doctrine vs original intent and how that creates different results.   If people want a dictatorship, they'll get one. Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, and Nazi Germany waged WWII despite being a parliamentary system. Heck, Mussolini and Tojo did their crimes under a monarch. Considering, all the interference the American CIA has done around the world it would be natural their dictatorships adopted a familiar presidential system. If MI5 was just as powerful we would see more parliamentary dictatorships. Those numbers are skewed by former Soviet Europe choosing en mass to adopt a parliamentary system. Do you think those people after seeing the horrors of authoritarian rule would let themselves slide back into it if they mass adopted presidential systems instead? Currently parliamentary Thailand is a dictatorship, despite having a monarchy. Their PM just so happens a puppet to the military. How about Pakistan, let's see how only just recently has this parliamentary system had a smooth power transition. I don't think I need to mention parliamentary Iraq. Presidential Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea, are or are projected to be some of the fastest developing countries in their region. Of course, there'll be negative counter examples in the presidential systems of Nigeria, Afghanistan, Honduras, Egypt, etc. But the point is that all systems are capable of committing harm if you put the wrong people in power.  The US, UK, Australia, and Poland participated in the highly controversial Iraq War, there was little discernable difference between how the systems responded to that situation then.  You're trying to create the impression that Canada and the US are on different planets. I disagree, of any two nations on earth we are the most similar. People from nations around the world chose to immigrate to our countries for a better life and they couldn't tell you the difference if they were dropped in a neighborhood of Calgary or Dallas. I say that while being a proud Canadian. As the sign under the Peace Arch, BC/WA says, ""children of a common mother"".   You claim to be a ""pragmatist"". Then pragmatically find the nuances and see some good in the US system and some bad in the British one."

CanadaPolitics,3d93h2,KevZero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:38:27 2015 UTC,"ENVIRONMENT — Ontario, Quebec, B.C., and Manitoba are among the provinces most aggressively pushing for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But resource-dependent provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland-Labrador are concerned about the economic impact of some measures that are being taken and are exploring their own solutions, such as carbon sequestration.  ENERGY —The premiers hope to finally complete their long-awaited “Canadian Energy Strategy” to somehow promote green energy innovations while also building controversial new pipelines to transport oil and gas to market. A wildcard is Alberta’s new NDP Premier Rachel Notley, who may be more amenable and eco-conscious than her predecessors.   Lots of activity in Canada on the climate change front, these days. Not surprisingly, the ongoing dearth in leadership at the federal level on this and other national issues is front and centre.    This first article suggests that Notley agreed with Couillard during a meeting they had earlier this week where they discussed the Energy East, TransCanada’s $12-billion energy project that, as a country, ""we have an obligation to show that we’re taking real action on climate change concerns and overall environmental protection and environmental standards."" That's very good news. Question is, of course, what will this commitment look like, concretely, especially given what's come to light in the next article.   http://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-is-notley-handing-quebec-a-veto-over-energy-east-pipeline  This next link goes to an article that describes a leaked draft of a document the Premiers will reportedly be finalizing and signing off on ""to fast-track new oil sands pipelines while watering down commitments to fight climate change.""  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/pan-canada-energy-strategy-contains-little-action-on-climate-change/article25477300/?service=mobile  It would be most unfortunate, and a real step back in my mind, if the Premieres do agree to this type of watered down deal. This final link goes to another recent article by the David Suzuki Foundation. It's very well written and, in my mind, makes a very compelling case for why--on the face of it--it's illogical to be taking about both expanding Canada's ability to move bitumen (through pipelines) and professing a commitment to reducing GHG emissions.   http://davidsuzuki.org/blogs/climate-blog/2015/07/premiers-going-in-one-direction-on-climate-action-the-world-in-another/  The other thing that strike me is that through changes that were made at the federal level a few years ago, the federal government pulled away from doing environmental assessments in many instances. This CBC article from 2013 describes projects that once required federal assessment but now no longer do, including ""heavy oil and oilsands processing facilities, including pipelines"".  One of the rationales that was put forth for the federal changes was that provincial environmental assessments would still apply and that there was no need to do both.   http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/technology/new-environmental-review-rules-anger-oilsands-critics-1.2252074  Wouldn't it be ironic if the provincial leaders were to do something that, in effect, follows the federal hands-off approach while at the same time criticizing the Feds for their lack of commitment and leadership?  Given the mounting scientific evidence of the need to reduce GHG emissions, it would be most unfortunate if our provincial leaders were to allow themselves to be sidetracked by short term economic/fossil fuel business interests.  As I've said elsewhere on this subreddit, just because people look for energy sources does not mean that they're choosing fossil fuels as a solution. Government, all governments, have a critical role to play in supporting our global society's transition from the old to the new world energy strategy. The faster Canada makes this shift in mindset in a meaningful way, the better off we'll all be. Pouring time, effort and resources into an energy sector that's becoming increasingly passé is simply eating up valuable time and effort that could be applied to solutions that are the way of the future.   I sure do hope our provincial leaders don't let us and the rest of the world down."

He even threatened the job of the rookie constable who was just doing his job and holding him to the same standard us little people much endure.   Mulcair already seems to believe he is above the law, imagine how much worse he will be if elected.   Mulcair held talks with the CPC about joining them before he even tried to join the NDP.  The only reason he's not a CPC backbencher is because of Kyoto or because his outrageous demands for a huge salary + cabinet position, depending on who's story you believe.  Even his version of events admits he held talks with the CPC about joining them  (Also, he was a former Liberal in Quebec and the Liberals there are a right-wing party who had been lead by a former Progressive-Conservative of the Mulroney kind while Mulcair was an MP) Mulcair's NDP has punished MPs for voting the way their constituents wanted instead of the way party brass wanted them to. The NDP has bought into anti-science fearmongering over GM foods and idiocy on nuclear power An NDP MP once filed a false police report for a crime that never happened Mulcair's NDP ignored staffer's accusation of harassment Mulcair's NDP accused of covering up harassment allegations as two more staffers come forward NDP MPs Pierre Jacob, Paul Dewar, Nathan Cullen, John Rafferty, Niki Ashton and Alex Atamanenko all lobbied the government to override TFW rejections on behalf of businesses in their ridings.     I used to think the NDP was an ethical party but I was obviously wrong.  They're probably the worst of them all.  They've had more ethics scandals than even the CPC despite not even being in power!   Imagine how bad they'll be if Canadians are gullible enough to give them power."
CanadaPolitics,3d6btb,Legal420Now,6,Tue Jul 14 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"Mulcair's NDP was behind a ""dirty tricks"" robocall campaign that tried to smear an MP in Quebec   From a partisan standpoint: Hilarious move. From a Canadian democracy standpoint: Childish.   Not exactly ethics damaging. They routed phone calls to a floor-crossing MP, so that people could could voice their lack of approval.    Mulcair's NDP tried to issue fraudulent political tax credits to people who made donations to a partisan thinktank   This points to ignorance more than anything. The Broadbent Institute would have known they couldn't issue tax receipts, as they have never claimed to be charitable. The NDP itself had nothing to gain by the Broadbent Institute getting donations. It's not like Ed Broadbent could be persuaded to like them more.    Mulcair's NDP illegally used public money for partisan purposes and has refused to pay it back   I'm very conflicted on the satellite offices. These were not secretive. They did a huge opening, with photo-ops etc. It was not done quietly. At the time I thought it was a great move, to try to get federal politics beyond the 'Ottawa bubble'. Further, the IBOE retroactively changed the rules, and added a sunset clause to the new rules... I will not be surprised if all parties start doing once the rule expires.   The devil is in the details though. The idea can be great, but if they mishandled the operations and public money was used for partisan purposes, that's a no go. I'm glad the NDP is fighting this one, because I think broadly speaking, this is an aspect of federal politics that should be cleared up.    Mulcair's NDP was ordered to repay illegal contributions after they tried to get around the ban on union donations by claiming donations as ""advertising fees""   Your scare quotes are just that. The money was for advertising at their conventions. It is not news that unions buy advertising space at NDP events. It's almost as though the NDP was created by the merging of the Canadian Labour Congress and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation.   Fighting EC over it seemed pointless. I'm glad the NDP just said fine, and paid it back.   It does call into question the fact that a government agency made a decision which resulted in many unions obtaining free advertising though.   Mulcair once pulled the ""Do you know who I am?"" card    Seriously? You went for this? While it can be seen a douchey thing to say, that is nothing. Should I bring out then CPC MP Eve Adams blocking a gas station over a car wash dispute? No... no I shouldn't, because its stupid, and has nothing to do with a party's ability to govern a country.    Mulcair held talks with the CPC about joining them before he even tried to join the NDP.   What does this have to do with ethics? He was interested in a job in the PMO. So?   Mulcair's NDP has punished MPs for voting the way their constituents wanted instead of the way party brass wanted them to.   Disagreed strongly with the move. An MP represents their constituents first, the party second, and if there is any time leftover, they can represent themselves. However, 'strict party discipline' is not ethics damaging.    idiocy on nuclear power   Provincial party, not the Fed. Nice try though.    An NDP MP once filed a false police report for a crime that never happened   Backbench MP, immediately booted from caucus. I'm not sure what else the party could have done. Obviously a terrible move on that individual's part.    Mulcair's NDP ignored staffer's accusation of harassment   Allegedly. Both the party and the union representing the staffers say an investigation was undertaken, and it was dismissed. Both the party and the union appear to be happy with the results of said investigation. NDP staffers have already changed unions over a disagreement, it seems unlikely to me that the union would do anything to undermine their credibility with the staff they represent.   At least this staff had the ability to file a grievance and have an investigation immediately underway. Too bad we can't say the same for CPC Senator Don Meredith's staff, be that the underage girl, of the revolving door of staff that left due to harassment and bullying.    Mulcair's NDP accused of covering up harassment allegations as two more staffers come forward   If true, this is a strike on the NDP, and the union representing them. No cookie for anyone, that needs to de dealt with properly. If true, it also diminishes the statement above.    NDP MPs Pierre Jacob, Paul Dewar, Nathan Cullen, John Rafferty, Niki Ashton and Alex Atamanenko all lobbied the government to override TFW rejections on behalf of businesses in their ridings.   Whether they agree with the policy or not, it's their job to advocate for their constituents. Amazing that the CPC, and now yourself, have tried to use their own policy as a weapon against the NDP. Pot meet Kettle.   I strongly disagree with the education-related tax credits. I'm not a matyr though, so I still claimed them. It would be stupid for NDP MPs not to go to bat for their constituents, even if meant trying to get them access to programs they don't like.   Would you link to an article that spoke of an NDP MP helping a constituent register for the new childcare benefit? Probably not, because that's just called doing their job, despite not agreeing with the program.   Considerable reach on a lot of these, and you're conclusion is laughable. A couple of real missteps though, and they need to be dealt with properly."

There just aren't that many wealthy people in Canada. According to the linked article, you hit 1% at $160k of income. This is somewhat lower than other estimates I've seen, but not hugely so.   The ""1%"" makes more sense in the US where the income distribution is wider. You don't hit 1% as a single filer in the US until $300k, and substantially higher than that if joint tax filers are included. That's a huge gulf from the average taxpayer, whereas in Canada the ""1%"" gulf is much less.  It has implications for tax policy -- we just don't have a deep enough critical mass of really wealthy people in this country for big tax increases on just the wealthy to raise very much money. You see that in the current Federal Liberal plan... the whole 4% tax increase at doesn't even fully fund their child benefit plan by their own numbers, let alone provide any money to pay for anything else.  Public policy in this country would be a lot more sane if people understood the income distribution. For example, Ontario teachers at the top of the grid don't feel wealthy at $92-99k of income, plus a government pension match of $11-12k, but that total compensation puts them in the top 5.6% of income earners in the country. You need a fair number of ordinary taxpayers to pay for one teacher at that rate. And l don't mean to pick on teachers... those pages and pages of Hydro One workers on the Sunshine list earning $300-500k are earning salaries that wouldn't be out of the ordinary in the US, but are absolutely bonkers in comparison to the general population in Canada. Then we wonder why Ontario can't balance it's budget. There aren't enough taxpayers to support this pay structure."
CanadaPolitics,3d802w,KingCreole8,4,Tue Jul 14 10:08:17 2015 UTC,"It's also incredibly geographically specific. Salary over $160k is nothing to sneeze at anywhere, but it buys significantly more in small rural communities than in some of the larger metro areas."
CanadaPolitics,3d802w,weecdngeer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:35:54 2015 UTC,"There are some good points here, and its an issue for politics on the left today. I've been clear when talking with other NDPers that the push to raise corporate taxes is not enough, nor is it enough raise them on just the wealthy.   To enact the kinds of social programs, and drive for quality a democratic socialist wants to see, we need to tax all but the poor to a much higher degree.  And as a labour activist, you do get push back when you suggest that while teachers are worth every penny they're paid (and I do believe that), they will have to carry a bigger tax burden given their high incomes."
CanadaPolitics,3d802w,Chrristoaivalis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:49 2015 UTC,"I've read the dialog in this thread with interest and must say I disagree with some of the comments. From what I've seen, the issue is more to do with income inequality, and whether it's growing, than what the median income of the top 1% of our population is (as an aside, the article quotes an income figure of $160,000 ... I'm assuming the authors are referring to median income for the top 1% but the article isn't clear on what the figure represents, precisely).   Following is an excerpt from a Huffington Post article dated March of 2014:   According to Lemieux and Riddell’s research, incomes in Canada grew by 13.5 per cent overall since 1982, adjusted for inflation, but almost all of that went to the top 10 per cent of earners. The top 0.01 per cent of earners saw incomes grow more than 160 per cent, adjusted for inflation, during that time. Income growth was “negligible"" for the bottom 90 per cent. http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/4897794   These next excerpts are from a Toronto Star article from September 2014 on an analysis that was done by the Broadbent Institute using recently released Statistics Canada data:   The top 10 per cent of Canadians have seen their median net worth grow by 42 per cent since 2005 to $2.1 million in 2012, the study found.  Meanwhile, the bottom 10 per cent of Canadians saw their median net worth shrink by 150 per cent. In 2012, their debts outweighed their assets by $5,100. That was worse than in 2005, when they owed $2,000 more than they owned, the study said.  Even more striking is the fact the bottom 50 per cent of Canadians own just 6 per cent of the wealth, while the bottom 30 per cent own just 1 per cent, the institute said.   The article also states that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has raised concerns over growing income inequality worldwide and is encouraging countries to rethink their tax policies to make them more distributive. The International Monetary Fund has also looked at the issue of income inequality, saying the growing imbalance could threaten future economic growth.  http://m.thestar.com/#/article/business/personal_finance/investing/2014/09/11/rich_gaining_more_wealth_study_shows.html  This next link goes to an analysis available on CBC's website from December 2014. http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/canada/manitoba/income-inequality-damaging-canadian-economy-1.2882793  It presents findings of a more recent report by the OECD which ""argues there is a 'sizeable and statistically negative' relationship between income inequality and economic growth"" and ""that raising income taxes on the rich can help the situation, rather than reducing growth"" and ""that reduced inequality promotes economic growth.""  The analysis also cites a number of options for addressing income inequality in Canada. The full article is worth reading; I've copied a few examples in, below, for ease of reference.     We must cap corporate annual bonuses. It has become common for corporate CEOs to make six and sometimes seven-figure bonuses. Bonuses are certainly valid in many instances, but the practice has become extreme. We must raise the number of tax brackets and marginal tax rates on higher income. We now have evidence that high or higher taxes on income do not hinder growth. So what’s stopping governments from raising the marginal tax rate on higher income to 60 per cent or even 70 per cent? Canada’s tax system has become considerably less progressive in recent years. We must encourage increased unionization. This will allow workers to be better protected and in general have higher wages and better benefits.    In sum, the message I'm left with is: regardless what the ""median income"" of the top 1% in Canada is, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is sound public and economic policy to address the issue of income inequality. I know a number of people who work very hard at their jobs--and for 40 - 50 hours a week--and they're nowhere close to the top 1% of earners. I wouldn't consider the work that they do to be any less valuable to society and yet they make significantly less than what ""top earners"" make. There's no rational reason for their contributions to society being valued less by the so called free market society. Lots of room, here, for improvements to our public policy in this area, in my view."

But yeah there is no organisational connection at all between the CPC and any provincial parties. Manning and Day were both insistent that no provincial parties take the names Reform or Alliance (though the Wildrose party is descended from a party called Alberta Alliance) and, though perhaps any of our Conservative friends here can clarify, that was a point of contention in the unification discussions (the PCs having retained their relationships with many of the provincial PC parties)."

He has mixed up our tax rate numerous times and vastly overstated the amount of room he has to raise corporate taxes.  Not only that but many economists would argue that any revenue gained from a CIT rate increase would be short-term and lost over the coming years to the negative revenue effects of those rate increases, possibly in even larger amounts than had been gained in the first place!  He's choosing a type of tax increase that can be easily offloaded onto workers and consumers while avoiding the one tax increase that's actually progressive and would be harder for the wealthy to avoid paying.  Mulcair's policies are great if you're a conservative but they're not progressive at all.   nding loopholes on CEO pay to fund the largest increase to the welfare state in our lifetime is pretty ok in my books   LMFAO.

CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,PickerPilgrim,18,Mon Jul 13 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"given that they have an all volunteer military   I grew up in the US. Went to an urban, mostly poor, mostly brown and black high school in a city without a lot of opportunities. Graduating class of 2001. Military recruiters were on our campus all the time. They always made promises. It was peacetime then. They'd see me carrying a guitar case and tell me I could play guitar for the army, that I'd get to travel, maybe be stationed in Hawaii. They get kids interested young and they make it sound like the best thing you can do with your life.   I didn't enlist, but I know a lot of my classmates did. They signed up to travel, goof off, learn a skill and get their education paid for. Four months after graduation the twin towers fell, and they were off to Afghanistan and then Iraq a few years later.   I don't know if any of those guys tried to get out (I left town with my own plans and didn't keep in touch) but I sure as hell wouldn't blame them if they did. And I'm not sure what the appropriate course of action for someone looking for a way out is, nor am I necessarily saying Canada should swing the doors wide open for deserters, but I take issue with this ""all volunteer"" thing.  They get kids to sign up when they're too young to know what they're getting into. They straight up lie to these kids about what their service will be like, and they most aggressively recruit in poor, minority communities. They exploit the lack of opportunity in the ghetto to round up 'volunteers' who come home in a few years with physical and psychological issues that get neglected in a deplorably inadequate Veterans Health Administration system.  I'm not sure my exact point, but to deny sympathy and support to these guys on account of they 'volunteered' get's under my skin. I'm not sure Canadians understand how aggressively the US military recruits young men in certain communities."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,EskimoNorth,9,Mon Jul 13 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but if they didn't have a choice and were forced to volunteer in your community how did you manage to not volunteer? Your community only had 2 choices."

CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,ChimoEngr,9,Tue Jul 14 13:23:50 2015 UTC,"No. If deserters truly feel that way then they should have the moral conviction to say so to their chain of command, disobey the order to deploy and do their time in Leavenworth.  There are two Vietnam era celebreties I greatly respect. Elvis for accepting that he was a citizen first and did a tour when he was called up. Mohammed Ali for saying ""fuck your white man's war"" and doing his time when he refused to serve. Both accepted that while they may not like the rules, the still had to abide by them. Those considering deserting from an all volunteer force should look at those teo examples and follow one of them."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,EskimoNorth,6,Mon Jul 13 20:07:21 2015 UTC,"Not for the soldier, for you maybe though. This is my response in another thread somewhere... it's a little angry:   ""He has to not fight an illegal war"", that's not a soldier's job.

It's your fucking job Joe Citizen to make sure that you vote responsibly, and elect governments that won't go bully other countries about issues of ""WMDs coughoilcough"" Once you have thoroughly failed this soldier and then he failed himself by not just quitting (which is something you can do in a volunteer army). Then there is no one to blame but the soldier. A soldier doesn't have an obligation to not fight an illegal war. You have the obligation to make sure they don't end up in them. ""Well there's nothing I can do it's a con majority hurr hurr"". Are you typing this from your jail cell because you have been arrested countless times over the past decade in your crusade against this illegal war? Or perhaps the courtroom where you are challenging this illegal war? Or perhaps you are typing from your smart phone behind a barricade before your resistance attacks Parliament to force it to right the wrong of going to war illegally? No? None of that? Just complained about it online? And now you expect soldiers to somehow be free to critique the government in uniform and also somehow maintain the discipline to go toe to toe with people who really hate you and are doing their best to sent you home in a box? Eat a bag of dicks. He didn't release, he ran. He didn't make a stand against an illegal war and take his licks, he ran. He didn't go over with his brother and sisters (all volunteers), he ran.

I couldn't agree more. It does make sense to wait a brief time, (hours at most) until you can arrest someone quietly.  After all, if you can arrest someone after a service, it's probably wiser to do that than to barge in while the priest is speaking and drag away a guy while he's trying to pray.  This is particularly true if it's a minority community in which winning hearts and minds is important.  But making churches into sanctuaries is an complete anachronism rooted in the idea that churches are holy ground in which only the laws of God hold sway and this fact is recognized to be so by the state.  This might have been true in 16th century England, but it's certainly not true today.  The government should respect our inherent right to practice our religion freely, but this does not mean that the state recognizes our property as ""holy""."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,SilvioBurlesPwny,31,Mon Jul 13 20:10:53 2015 UTC,"To those of you who are holding a firm line on this I invite you to reconsider your opinions.  I volunteered helping some of these young men and women when they came to Canada after the first few years of the Iraq War.  The world is not so black and white, you can think of it as either you sign the contract or you don’t, but that misses the unique reality of combat and unemployment in America. The first is the notion of choice.  Many of the men and women come from impoverished backgrounds in rural America.  In small towns in the Carolinas and in Washington there are no real jobs.  The only employer in the region is the Armed Forces.  Because of the very high cost college for most of these people is out of the question.  Some young parents join to get the benefits of health care for their children (something we take for granted here). Recruiters often overpromise the benefits of enlisting (tuition, health care benefits) while at the same time understating the degree that these recruits will be subject to combat.  I met one young man who enlisted to be a mechanic and was being trained to breach doors and secure rooms for urban combat.  When he said that he was to be a mechanic his CO told him that he would be in combat.  So he deserted and fled to Canada. Another guy I met was from rural Washington and signed up so that he could pay for college.  However, the rigors of the job, and the continual deployment that many Marines have seen over the past decade more or less  Another common reason for deserting was the wide ranging practice of “stop-loss.”  I am pulling from wiki here, but this basically is defined as:   In the U.S. military, it is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date and up to their contractually agreed end of active obligated service (EAOS). It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service. Stop-loss was used immediately before and during the first Persian Gulf War. Since then, it has been used during deployments to Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo and after the September 11 attacks and the subsequent War on Terror. The policy has been legally challenged several times. However, federal courts have consistently found that military service members contractually agree that their term of service may be involuntarily extended until the end of their obligated service  That is pretty wild if you ask me.  The US military can unilaterally extend your time in the military if it deems it necessary.  This is particularly tough given the nature of the contract.  They are putting you in combat roles, and given what we now know about PTSD I could easily see someone deserting after their first tour in Fallujah or the Korengal.    If we are going to think of it as just a contract that you sign up for we need to consider the inequity of this specific type of contract (unlimited extension), the asymmetry between the parties that are signing it (poor Americans and the US military), and the unique nature of the contract (you are going to go kill people who will also be trying to kill you)."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,d-boom,20,Mon Jul 13 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"In small towns in the Carolinas and in Washington there are no real jobs. The only employer in the region is the Armed Forces.   Those aren't the only options. There are choices besides stay in ones home town and joining the armed forces.    I met one young man who enlisted to be a mechanic and was being trained to breach doors and secure rooms for urban combat. When he said that he was to be a mechanic his CO told him that he would be in combat.    That is called Universality of Service. Any service member is expected to be ready and able to fight if needed. Its a core principle of the military. We have the same thing here. A RCN sonar tech is expected to pick up a rifle and fight if ordered to. That is part of signing the contract and taking the oath. Joining the military and expecting to be exempt from combat is like working for McDonalds and being surprised that the job involves working with food.   Another common reason for deserting was the wide ranging practice of “stop-loss.”    From the wiki quote: ""federal courts have consistently found that military service members contractually agree that their term of service may be involuntarily extended until the end of their obligated service"". This was part of the contract that they agreed to and signed. If they didn't like that provision they should not have joined. Disliking something after the fact does not justify breach of contract or desertion.

Maybe not the only option. But an easy one, with easy access, greater perks and prestige than an entry-level job at Mcdonald's. It's also a lifestyle that government does its best to romanticize.  If you were faced with a) working full time at a minimum wage job for years, trying to save up, perhaps in vain for something greater. or b) serving in the military, gaining respect, and a free education all while believing you're helping your country what would you do?  I can't really fault someone for choosing the latter.

CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,algysidfgoa87hfalsjd,7,Mon Jul 13 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that I can fault them.  But I'm not sure I can fault them enough to warrant sending them to jail.  Especially not when I consider how aggressively the US goes after highschool students.  I'm happy to call an 18 year old kid an idiot who should've known better.  But when that kid hasn't done anything to harm anyone (oh no! their ignorance - which was intentionally sought out - cost the US military one millionth of one percent of their budget for the year!), I'm not happy to send that kid to jail.  Whether or not Canada should actively help deserters avoid prison is a trickier issue, of course.  It's not one I have enough information to answer.  I just know I wouldn't use ""they broke their contract"" in my decision making."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,d-boom,6,Mon Jul 13 19:21:37 2015 UTC,The jail sentence isn't just about the cost to the tax payers. It is about discipline and ensuring an effective military. Desertion and a lack of military discipline can cause serious problems. The reason the military insist on discipline and following orders even in peace time on home soil is because it needs to be second nature to the soldiers. When they get on that two way range they need to follow orders and not spend their time weighing whether or not to do what the officer says. And they certainly should wander off because they don't like what is happening.  The whole aggressive recruiters is a bit of a red herring. Regardless of why they signed up they did sign up and took an oath to serve the country and obey the orders they receive.
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,CptCoatrack,11,Mon Jul 13 19:33:23 2015 UTC,The whole aggressive recruiters is a bit of a red herring.   How? You claim they should've known what they were getting into when they signed up. Do you blame the deceivers or the deceived?

What I don't understand is Canadians who seem to believe that just because the US has reason to imprison these people, Canada should go along with that.  I mentioned financials because that's a harm done to actual people.  I don't believe Canada should be looking to help people who harm other people.  The US military, though, isn't a person.  I'm only interested in protecting it from harm as long as it is doing good in people's lives.  Right now it's doing some good in people's lives for sure, but it's also doing harm.  If pressuring it to be more ethical in its recruitment practices serves to reduce that harm, I'm all for applying that pressure.  If deserters harm the US military, then the US shouldn't recruit deserters.  Their approach to this is to punish deserters severely enough to discourage desertion.  On the other hand, by accepting deserters, Canada harms the US military ever so slightly.  Not currently by enough to prevent the US military from protecting the people it protects, but perhaps (but still probably not) by enough to encourage them to stop recruiting people who are likely to have a change of heart when faced with reality.  In other words:   Regardless of why they signed up they did sign up and took an oath to serve the country and obey the orders they receive.   The only reason I care about that is continued good relations with the US.  I might care a bit more if we were talking about Canadian deserters, but we're not."

Their military effectiveness is in our interests as well. Not to mention we have the same laws. If I'd done that I'd be sitting in Club Ed for violating the National Defense Act rather than wasting time on reddit.

I was 17 and was one of the youngest that joined that year. We all knew what we were getting into, for the most part. Only after we signed up did we know that we could be called back into active duty within 5 years of leaving.  The US is even worse. They have 'stop-loss' where they can extend your service as long as they want.  I joined the army for many reasons others do, I needed money and at 17 years, it's the best money you'll see. Where I lived at the time, jobs were scarce. I could have opted to sign up for welfare but I like earning my money. That means I had a choice between 2 shitty options. If the PM changed since you joined, then the terms of your contract have also changed and like many contracts, that change would render the original contract null and void.  If I joined as a peacekeeper and some politician changes my role without my consent, that's enough reason to quit/flee. If I joined as a clerk and someone changed my role to become a sniper, that's not right.  So, it's not a simple as you put it. It's much more complex."

You answered these questions?   1) Are you willing to die for this country?  2) Are you willing to kill for this country?  3) Are you willing to fight in a theatre or war that you may not personally believe in but are lawfully ordered to go to?  You didn't join as a peacekeeper. There is no way that there is any confusion as to your role after your interview.

Its use is founded on Title 10, United States Code, Section 12305(a) which states in part: ""... the President may suspend any provision of law relating to promotion, retirement, or separation applicable to any member of the armed forces who the President determines is essential to the national security of the United States"" and Paragraph 10(c) of DD Form 4/1 (The Armed Forces Enlistment Contract) which states: ""In the event of war, my enlistment in the Armed Forces continues until six (6) months after the war ends, unless the enlistment is ended sooner by the President of the United States.""  Every person who enlists in a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces signs an initial contract with an eight (8) year service obligation. The enlistment contract for a person going on active duty generally stipulates an initial period of active duty from 2 to 5 years, followed by service in a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States for the remainder of the eight year obligation.[1] Service members whose ETS, retirement, or end of service obligation date falls during a deployment may be involuntarily extended until the end of their unit's deployment."

CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,Issachar,19,Mon Jul 13 18:35:30 2015 UTC,Good.  We should not become refuge for soldiers deserting.  It is a volunteer army.  Disobeying a lawful order is significantly different from desertion.  Disobeying an unlawful order is a whole other ball game.   To compare the armed forces of the United States today to the draft days of the Vietnam war is moronic (in my opinion).  War resisters were fleeing from something they were forced into serving. Sgt Hart volunteered like the half dozen other deserters.
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,medym,5,Tue Jul 14 00:15:41 2015 UTC,"To compare the armed forces of the United States today to the draft days of the Vietnam war is moronic (in my opinion).   Here's something to consider though.  If you have an all-volunteer army, the result is that your fighting soldiers tend to come from lower socio-economic groups.  And you get almost no soldiers from the socio-economic groups that go on to be politicians, legislators, Presidents and Prime Ministers.  So you end up with a situation in which the people deciding whether or not to go to war have very little ""skin in the game"".  And what they do have at risk is going to be their political ambitions or their financial situation.  And war can dramatically aid both those things if you're in the right position.   But it's not their blood on the line.  It's not going to be their nephew, niece, son or daughter getting shot down over Syria and getting beheaded or burned alive.  By contrast, a draft that worked, (i.e. one in which the well-connected didn't ""conveniently"" get their children stationed in safe places), a draft in which their child was just as great a risk of a horrible death as the man making $20,000 a year focuses a politician's mind differently.  If they knew by voting for war that their child or their sister's child or their neighbours child might be the one coming home mentally broken and drinking themselves to death, (or not coming home at all), we might see decisions about war being considered more carefully.  Perhaps bringing back a draft or mandatory military service might be a very good thing."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,Issachar,6,Tue Jul 14 01:34:18 2015 UTC,"Here's something to consider though. If you have an all-volunteer army, the result is that your fighting soldiers tend to come from lower socio-economic groups. And you get almost no soldiers from the socio-economic groups that go on to be politicians, legislators, Presidents and Prime Ministers.   There are literally dozens of senior politicians in the United States who served. Bush, Bush, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Truman had prior military service. Current politicians who may be seeking the nomination to run for president include Lindsey Graham, Jim Webb and Rick Perry- all with military service.  Canadians also have a large share of military veterans seeking election, Garneau, O'Toole, Leslie, Sajin, and so on.  So lets move past that argument.  Lower socio-economic position does not mean you inherently make poor decisions or uninformed ones. Our CDSs have come from modest beginnings to rise through the ranks.  Military service is an equalizer.    Hey, I am all for mandatory military service. I think more people should serve. But that does not excuse desertion.  When you join you are explicitly explained the risks, the commitment and the challenges."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,ChimoEngr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I think not.  Throwing up a few names with military service most of which are from times when the United States had the draft hardly negates my point.  I didn't say that no one in the military will ever get into politics.   The point remains that countries without mandatory service tend to pull their soldiers from the poor.  Those without options other good options.  While countries with mandatory military pull their soldiers from all of society.  And I'm sure it hasn't escaped anyone's notice that the rich, powerful and well connected, (those that volunteer armies tend not to draw soldiers from), tend to be the ones from whom political leadership is drawn.  If I showed you a couple of dozen rich, white, ivy league kids in America with rich parents and a couple of dozen poor black kids and asked you which are more likely to be sent to fight in a desert country after having volunteered would you say you know, it's pretty much a toss-up and it's just as likely those ivy league kids will have spent two years in the middle east getting shot at as those poor black kids""?   If I asked you whose parents are more likely to be making the decisions about whether or not to risk soldier's lives would you say ""again, it's a toss up""?  Not a chance.  Volunteer armies generally pull from the poor and disadvantaged.  Governments are generally led and run by the rich and powerful who are far less likely than the poor to have their kids in the line of fire."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,Issachar,3,Tue Jul 14 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps bringing back a draft or mandatory military service might be a very good thing.   There are a number of problems with instituting a draft in Canada. Historically it has been a divisive issue, even more divisive than anything to do with Quebec being seen as getting special treatement. The gain from implementing the draft has to be large neough to risk splitting the country into two, or even more peicies. Maybe not to the point that provinces attempt to seperate, but it would definetly make for a disfunctional country.  The more general issue I have, is that not everyone is suited for military service. There are some people who will not subordinate themselves to following orders without getting an explenation first, or at least the promise of one. They must either be broken, or turfed. Forcing people like that to serve in an institution that will damage them wether or not they do any high risk activities, is not something I can consider to be a public good."
CanadaPolitics,3d51bd,darkretributor,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:54:52 2015 UTC,"That's probably the largest problem with mandatory military service and as you say it's probably fatal to the whole idea.  After all, Quebec residents seem to have a rejection of any military action that cannot be overcome.  The fight against the Nazi's was probably the most justifiable war in history and Quebec was very clear in it's rejection of any involvement.  And if you're not willing to have mandatory military service in order to fight literally Hitler, (okay, not him personally), it's safe to say that you're fairly emphatically opposed to mandatory military service.  That said, the benefits of mandatory military service remain even if they remain out of our reach.  Without mandatory military service there will always be large gulf between the people doing the deciding and the people doing the dying.  And I suspect that that gulf leads to different military decision making.  Ironically, a lack of mandatory military service may make Canada more likely to get involved in wars that we should stay out of."

There are massive differences between a cell phone contract and military service.  First off, a bad cell phone contract can't kill you.  Second, a bad cell phone contract doesn't move from ""you patrol on a US base with a gun that you don't use because there is no war"" to ""go kill people, oh and btw, it turns out that we were totally mistaken about those WMDs, they never existed at all"".  Third, no cell phone contract can be extended without your consent.  By contrast, soldiers had their service terms renewed and could not quit due to the war.

Sure, they could choose not to enlist, and continue working two jobs packing meat and picking fruit forever in poverty, or if they join the army they are promised a whole world of opportunities and education/training but biggest of all its a chance for them to get somewhere and pull themselves out of poverty.  If you join the army out of desperation, you should not have to get fucked in the ass in jail if you suddenly have objections to killing people or dying.

In more general terms that interview increased my respect for Mulcair just a little bit more.  And just to fill in a possible blank, I actually favour retention of the Senate, in essentially its current form.  From my POV, the only changes would be to improve the appointment process - surely it can't be that hard to find 100 Canadians who are knowledgeable about some field of public policy or the other and who would actually be honoured to serve their fellow citizens.

The first is discussion with the Premiers and trying to reach a deal between the governments. Most of the provinces favour reform of the Senate, so there's an opening point to get them to consider abolition.  Yes, the feds would have to grant concessions to the provinces; but why is this inherently considered a bad thing? There should be some sort of give-and-take in the process.   Barring working with the Premiers, Mulcair could take a more populist route and encourage citizens to call for province wide referendums on the issue. We've done it before (Electoral Reform, HST, Charlottetown Accord, Quebec Separation) and then it would go to the people; who generally seem to see the Senate in a negative view, more so than the Premiers.  It would take a lot of doing to get provincial governments to honour the results, but it could also put some Premiers in a position where they have to respond or risk losing support in their province.   The second route could have a high political cost; it could alienate Premiers from working with the feds in the future, and if the citizens reject abolition then the subject is dead for at least two decades...but it could also be the swiftest route to actual action."

Of course, if representation is something they want, there's ways to compromise there; off the top of my head, codifying the Council of the Federation beyond a once a year summit of Premiers and expanding it to a federal body with provincially appointed representatives that work within the federal government could be a tempting counteroffer...But that's just me spitballing."

It is constitutionally guaranteed to have at least as many MPs as Senators (4).   codifying the Council of the Federation beyond a once a year summit of Premiers and expanding it to a federal body with provincially appointed representatives that work within the federal government could be a tempting counteroffer   Or a reformed Senate that actually IS a house of regional/provincial representation

Maybe I'm cynical but I feel if there was any real desire to combat crime these kinds of programs would be given higher priority.   I think the word ""tough"" in ""tough on crime"" is intended to signal a more punitive approach, rather than an approach that will reduce the crime rate. With that in mind, punishing inmates by reducing their access to education would seem to be in keeping with the stated goal.  That said, I very wholeheartedly disagree with the more punitive approach. I think rehabilitation of those who have made mistakes is both the moral thing to do and also avoids the cycle where inmates who went in for relatively minor offences leave prison hardened (heavily punished) criminals and go out and commit more crimes."

It is somewhat disingenuous to call the gun crime bill 'Layton's gun crime bill' considering it was actually a conservative bill and the NDP were requesting changes be made to it.

The government hired the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche to examine prisons in seven countries aimed at building an “understanding of various models, approaches and experiences,” according the 1,400-page report obtained by CTV News under the Access to Information Act.   That's clearly a far cry from actively planning to privatize prisons, but it shows the CPC considers it an option (which is bad enough, personally). It doesn't seem like a big leap to associate private prisons with the 'small government' side of the political spectrum."
CanadaPolitics,3d4j0x,doctorb_gus,16,Mon Jul 13 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but from the CTV article:   Public Safety Minister Vic Toews acknowledged he discussed the idea of private prisons with his British counterpart in a meeting in May, but said he ended up ruling it out.  “Britain indicates . . . that there were benefits. I’ve examined that myself, but I don’t see there are sufficient benefits to change over an entire system,” Toews said.  “I didn’t feel there was any benefit to going toward a privatization model, that is the private supervision of prisoners,” he said. “We have no interest in going to a private model which would put the supervision of prisoners in private hands."

It's perfectly valid to look at them as being analogous, especially in this context where prison guard unions have lobbied for tougher sentences - the exact concern people have about private prisons - simply because of how these policies result in achieving financial goals for themselves at the expense of others.."

Unfortunately due to them manufacturing the furniture with unique fasteners and requiring them to move anything, if you wanted a cubicle moved you had to get someone in to move it for you.

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Palpz,13,Mon Jul 13 14:11:29 2015 UTC,OK the CPC  lose power in October and we have an NDP majority. Will the majority conservative caucus in Senate stall the NDP agenda or will they swallow their pride and pass NDP legislation.   If an unelected Senate stall his agenda Thomas mulcair head will explode I think
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Majromax,20,Mon Jul 13 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"You could ask the same question about a hypothetical Liberal majority, or an NDP/Liberal de facto arrangement.  The constitutional convention is that the Senate does not block supply.  On the other hand, there may be a partisan advantage to doing so.  The trend of recent years has been that when partisan advantage conflicts with constitutional convention, the advantage wins out much of the time.  Of course, the ""majority conservative caucus"" is not a sure-fire thing.  Out of 105 senators, 47 are affiliated with the Conservative party and 1 is a Progressive Conservative.  The Senate currently has 22 vacancies.  An incoming non-Conservative Prime Minister could promptly appoint enough Senators to turn the Conservatives into a strong minority rather than a majority.  This would be no problem for a hypothetical PM Trudeau that has a platform item on how his government would appoint Senators, but it could be an optics problem for Mulcair that does not wish to appoint any Senators.  Harper could also fill all of these vacancies himself at any point before the official dissolution.  Doing so would be even worse optics, however, since it would look like a transparent power grab in advance of losing in October.  (Convention is less settled on whether the Governor General must accept appointment advice during the writ period.)  Perhaps rather than abolition-by-stealth or raw neglect, the current set of Senate vacancies is a stealth transition plan in the event that the Conservatives lose in October."

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Majromax,8,Mon Jul 13 15:37:32 2015 UTC,"No Province is allowed to go beneath 50% representation in the Senate by convention.  So what happens when PEI loses another Senator due to retirement or prison? Will the Governor General be required to appoint Senators?    Yes, but convention does not crystallize into law, especially here when it would conflict with the convention of appointing Senators only upon advice.  That said, I'm also looking forward to the results of the ongoing Senate appointment case.  That has the potential to set out when an unfilled vacancy turns from an arbitrary affair to a breach of convention to a breach of a fundamental constitutional guarantee.  Upon the latter, the Governor-General would then have to reconcile advice with constitutional obligation.  I think the only way to really do that would be to dismiss the Prime Minister and appoint another who would give advice.  This same process would apply to breaches of any other democratic guarantee, such as seeking to prorogue Parliament for longer than a year."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,ChimoEngr,5,Mon Jul 13 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"No Province is allowed to go beneath 50% representation in the Senate by convention   I've never heard of that convention before. Do you have any source for it? The only lower limit I've ever heard mentionned for the Senate was the 15 member quorom. What you've mentionned would set a higher bar for forcing the GG's hand so before I get my hopes up, I'd like to know a bit more about it."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Majromax,6,Mon Jul 13 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"De jure, the Governor-General appoints the Senators.  I don't recall of any time where an outgoing Prime Minister has made controversial appointments, but I suspect that in such circumstances the practice would be for the Governor-General to refuse advice to appoint Senators until after Parliament has convened and the new government has demonstrated the House's confidence."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,CanadianHistorian,2,Mon Jul 13 18:22:22 2015 UTC,I think the day before an election is called is the last day on which he could do so without raising a question of the legitimacy of said action.  Whether or not the GG would make such an appointment after dissolving Parliament would be a judgement call on his part.
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,bunglejerry,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:03 2015 UTC,"Well, de jure, no. The Governor-General is allowed to do that. :)  Whether or not the Governor-General decides to follow the advice of the Prime Minister given under such circumstances would be more of a de facto decision; one without precedent that I'm aware of, so His Excellency would be charting new territory."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Majromax,2,Mon Jul 13 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"Like de jure the election can be taken to the full 5 years from the previous one and be held in May but de facto previous Prime Ministers have held one 4 years into their mandate.    Well, no, de jure each general election must be held on the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election, as per the amendments to the elections act made in 2007. You know, while we're being pedantic and all.   Anyways, I'll stand by the 2nd part of my initial response to your reworded question. Both the GG failing to appoint Senators upon the advice of the current Prime Minister and the Prime Minister trying to get the GG to appoint Sentators after losing an election would be unprecedented in Canadian politics, so we can't really give you a definitive answer. Not that it would be definitive anyways, as the GG could break from precedent.   If you're asking what I think would happen, I think the GG in this instance would probably err on the side of the course of action which doesn't on the face of things appear to be grossly undemocratic, and would likely refraim from appointing said Senators."

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,bunglejerry,3,Mon Jul 13 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting addition on the transgender rights bill, as I just did some research on it: does everyone know that this bill was re-instated from the previous session (2013 following prorogation), and that in the previous session, the bill had passed Senate committee review without any amendments proposed, and was being debated at Third Reading, and that Third Reading debate was delayed at the request of Senator Plett? I find this interesting, because when the Senate re-studied the bill following its re-instatement (it was only re-instated up to the beginning of Senate review), they amended it at Committee (Senator Plett moved the amendment). Timelines are also pretty obvious indicators of sabotage, here. The bill in its current form was re-instated in the Senate in October 2013 (and remember, the Senate had already conducted a lot of debate on this bill, as it had made it all the way to their Third Reading - the final stage in their legislative process - before the September prorogation). And yet debate on the bill didn't happen until Second Reading began approximately 8 months later, in June 2014. Then it went to committee for review after another four month delay, in October 2014. The committee reviewed it, then sat on it for another four months, only getting back to it in February 2015, which is when Senator Plett moved the amendment. The committee reported it back to the Senate, who then didn't bother to look at it for another four months, which means the amendment wasn't even debated until June 2015. Since Senate amendments force a bill back to the House, this of course left no time for the House to review the amendment, agree or not, and send it back to the Senate pre-election. So all of these delays effectively killed a bill that the House approved and first sent to the Senate in March 2013."

I agreed, but I think the will of the House is generally the will of the government because the government is generally guiding the will of the House. Equally, my original question deals with the Senate blocking Parliamentary legislation - I imagine this would only happen when the Senate majority and House majority were different parties, so it is likely a majority government being blocked by Official Opposition senators. In the context of the question, it's probably both the will of the government and the will of the House being blocked."

If the unelected senate is seen to be sabotaging the work of the elected house, it will get easier and easier to drum up support amongst the populations for its abolition.   The Senate has to know that what is best for them is to remain quiet on the sidelines.  The question I want to know of Mulcair is this: given that Senate abolition will take years at a minimum, what will he do as vacancies pop up? He's said he'll never appoint senators, but I understand legally he might have to.  Abolition is all well and good, but the NDP need to elucidate a short-term plan in the meantime."

If events conspire to get the public really whipped up against the senate, premiers might find themselves having to change their approach or else face being voted out in the next provincial election.  It's definitely a challenge, though. I see the best hope being to get the premiers agreeing in advance to respect the results of a non-binding nationwide referendum. Given that unanimity is a requirement, that can stop the process being sabotaged by a single province.  The spanner in the works, of course, is reform. If the two choices were abolition vs. status quo, abolition could win. But if a third option were offered, I think it would take the Senate seriously overstepping their limits before abolition could win in a referendum."

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,QuizzicalButthead,2,Mon Jul 13 18:52:09 2015 UTC,I started as a Paul Martin Liberal going into to university. By the time I left I was a social libertarian to the economic right of Stephen Harper.
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,CisPrivileged,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:41:57 2015 UTC,That's a shift! Care to share how that came about?
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,ChimoEngr,3,Mon Jul 13 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest I didn't really know much about politics until half way through university. My idea of getting informed at the time was watching the debates before an election. I think a lot of people, especially young people, assume that they're liberal if they don't really think about it or pay attention (not saying people can't be liberal once they start getting informed).  I started off by familiarizing myself slowly with the news and whenever a debate was going on I tried to research it and come to my own conclusion. I soon started realizing that I generally agreed with Harper on a lot of issues, though of course not all.  At the same time I tried to read my university paper's  news and opinion articles. I very quickly realized that I didn't share the extreme left wing view point that was being pushed there. I found the constant articles on shutting down the 'tar sands' annoying and unrealistic. I didn't really care about having gender neutral bathrooms on campus and thought it seemed like a complete waste of time and effort to debate something which such a small part of the population would even 'need'.  I was annoyed that my student society took my money and used it for causes that I didn't agree with. Or worse, they used it to prop up failing businesses in the student union building so they could pay students above market rates. I didn't understand why they didn't rent the space to corporations like subway and McDonald's. It was a no brainer to me, the student society could effectively sit back, collect money, and reduce or eliminate student fees.  I took a very strenuous undergrad degree and it didn't help that I was stressed right out and having to duck and weave around protests that bordered on the insane. One group dug up the lawn in front of the library because they believed in 'gardens not lawns' for example. Ironically I think the heavy activism on campus pushed me rightward.  Sometime in late University I decided I wanted to read biographies from famous politicians and get a sense of their principles and their journey. At this point I was certain I was going to run for office at some point. I started with Sir John A. (the man who made us) after that I would pick up biographies at the thrift store when I saw them (sometimes having tastes for 'boring' books is awesome. Eventually I found Margaret Thatcher's ""The Downing Street Years"". This book had an incredible affect on me. Her policies, her views and her decisions just made sense to me. Our thought processes were the same, we seemed to have similar values. I still have this book on my book shelf, I've read it twice and talking about it makes me want to read it again.   In that book, Thatcher references a book by Friedrich Hayek called ""The Constitution of Liberty"". She apparantly thrust on the table during a presentation and said ""This is what we believe in"". I bought that and read it. Again this book clicked with me and helped me develop my understanding of economics. I continued reading his other books. I went on from there to read Milton Friedman's ""Capitalism and Freedom"" (it was okay), and am now slogging through Atlas shrugged (it should have been half as long!).  That's how I ended up firmly on the right of the economic spectrum (that ended up way longer than I wanted). Like most young people I just don't care about traditional social conservative values (gay marriage, abortion etc). I think all these books pushed me further towards the social  libertarian side of things.  I prefer to describe myself as a social libertarian rather than a progressive for a couple reasons. First, libertarian for me is uniquely associated with the right. Second, progressives also tend to be okay with more extreme measures to fix things like the wage gap or racial imbalances (like affirmative action which I'm against. It also comes with a bunch of other things like wanting to reduce income inequality which I don't particularly care about, certainly not at the low levels we see in Canada."

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,practicaldildo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:49:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure if it is the same everywhere, but in Quebec the prices in bars are often displayed with tax included, but that is the only place I can think of where that is true.  Maybe the idea is that estimating tax is easy after you do it often, but in situations where it is not (or you are drinking) they should make it easier?  I certainly think it would be nice to have it calculated in everywhere."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,lytical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer not to do any calculations at all, especially there are also various exemptions and additional taxes, and regional differences.

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,trollunit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:50:55 2015 UTC,"/u/Political_Junky answered this question for me a few weeks ago:   The problem is that pricing regulations are exclusively provincial jurisdiction.    Much of the reason for the notoriety of the GST in Canada is for reasons of an obscure Constitutional provision. Other countries with a Value Added Tax legislate that posted prices include the tax; thus, consumers are vaguely aware of it but ""what they see is what they pay"". Canada cannot do this because jurisdiction over most advertising and price-posting is in the domain of the provinces under the Constitution Act, 1867. The provinces have chosen not to require prices to include the GST, similar to their provincial sales taxes. As a result, virtually all prices (except for fuel pump prices, taxi meters and a few other things) are shown ""pre-GST"", with the tax (or taxes) listed separately.   This is a really unfortunate situation because I agree with you that the primary reason governments are so scared of raising GST is that it is so visible to consumers. That's why they prefer to raise corporate taxes or income taxes or random fees, etc., because even though the same people all pay it they don't feel like they're paying it.  Getting the provinces on board to mandate after tax prices is crucial to making our tax system more efficient. Ideally GST would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 15-20%; this would give you enough additional revenue (assuming each point raise in GST is worth $7 billion) to cut corporate and personal income taxes in half without reducing government revenue. I'd also leave enough room to give healthy rebates for those living in poverty that taper off as income increase so they're no worse off."

I know the optics would be terrible. I'm imagining a Mulroney-Campbell scenario where he's already given up winning, but thinks someone else in the party might be able to do better."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Hoarse-horse,7,Mon Jul 13 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"There is no conceivable partisan advantage in doing so.  Even if the election were delayed until next year, we would quickly run into the 5-year constitutional limit.  The election writs were returned on May 23, 2011, which means that dissolution would have to occur no earlier than the end of May in 2016.  Six months of heavy PR would likely not overcome the terrible optics."

I think switching Harper out with a less weary looking leader counts as a conceivable advantage. It didn't work out when Mulroney tried it, but the McGuinty-Wynne switch worked like a charm.

Keeping in mind that I think that the likelihood of Mr. Harper or any PM simply not asking for an election when they're required to ask for an election under law is negligible enough to be discounted completely, if such a scenario were for some reason to occur, I think the GG would probably go ahead and make the call regardless."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,Hoarse-horse,3,Mon Jul 13 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think the GG would probably go ahead and make the call regardless.    For the PM to ignore the fixed election law by delaying the call would put the GG in a conflict of determining who's advice is binding. That of Parliament through legislation, or that of the PM. it would be interesting to see which way it went, but I doubt we'd ever see it. Repealing the fixed election law would be a lot easier."

CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,SulfuricDonut,2,Mon Jul 13 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"I can answer this question for a univeristy as opposed to a hospital, which is somewhat similar.  Government fees are intended to cover most of the necessary things and programs a university needs, and tuition is meant to cover the cost of literally teaching the classes.    This is an oversimplification, but you have three camps of funding.  Tuition to go to Professors and administration of classes, government funding to go towards renovations, new buildings, and all the concrete things a university needs, and, finally, private donations either go to things that government funding COULD cover, but doesn't, or had to stop covering, or they can go towards programs the government won't cover, or isn't allowed to cover.  Universities often ask for private donations for their scholarship funds, which aren't covered by the government because the government(s) already provide bursaries directly to students.  Same can go for internship funding, experimental projects, and short-term very specific workshops, conferences, etc.    All of these rules can and do go out the window if there is ever a crisis and something desperately needs funding."
CanadaPolitics,3d4mi0,SulfuricDonut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm curious how the breakdown works for healthcare. In B.C. at least the private funding tends to be for new facilities, which causes me to scratch my head. If we need a new hospital (or even a new wing), why isn't that considered ""essential"" and covered by tax dollars?   Maybe because practically, it's easier to privately fundraise for a new children's hospital than to raise money to pay nurses?"

Especially when you consider the fact that Harper has the worst record on both job creation and economic growth in over 80 years.

Proper targeting of said infrastructure spending, such as towards the $8 billion+ in differed maintenance on our nations post-secondary institutions (this is just the cost at 51 institutions that are members of CAUBO) could help address the annual decrease in our international rankings for R&D, innovation, and education. (WEF global competitiveness indexes)  That would have improved our advanced education infrastructure, increasing our 'capacity for innovation', and created jobs. The hat-trick, if you will.

What made it even more frustrating for me was the two people I was canvassing with seemed to have little knowledge/interest about policies either - why were they there?   Again I have had this exact experience. Most of the people I've come across volunteering don't have any interest or knowledge of policy either. I have wondered the exact same thing because for me you volunteer for a party because you think their policies are the best for the country, not just because you've always been a Conservative or you can't stand the thought of the Liberals winning. A lot of people treat it more like a social club as well. I mean I'm grateful people are getting politically involved in a constructive way but it is so confusing for me."

CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,MethoxyEthane,5,Tue Jul 14 18:48:38 2015 UTC,The Victory Lab was a fantastic read. I highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in the inner workings of political strategy.
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,drhuge12,6,Mon Jul 13 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"It is a good read, but I honestly found it kind of depressing that elections have basically been reduced to formulae by consultants and strategists.

CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,drhuge12,3,Mon Jul 13 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Was that a volunteer position? How many hours a week did it take up? What kind of stuff were you doing when knocking on doors if not trying to convince people of things?
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,jtbc,3,Mon Jul 13 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was a volunteer position. However many hours you're willing to give is how many a campaign will take.   What kind of stuff were you doing when knocking on doors if not trying to convince people of things?   Door knocking is all about collecting data on your supporters. If people actually have questions you can try to answer them if you feel comfortable but if they aren't a receptive voter you move on. It's a waste of time to try to convince them."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,hankjmoody,3,Mon Jul 13 21:54:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as /u/Political_Junky said, they're happy to have however many man-hours you can throw at them.  You basically knock, introduce yourself politely, ask if you can count on their vote, note the response, and go on to the next door."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,ctcsupplies,2,Mon Jul 13 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"Depending on the level of sophistication of the campaign, you might also ask some survey questions (which policies do you care about?) or record some demographics. Typically you are also looking for people who will take a lawn or a window sign, or who need a ride to the polls on E-day.  Doorknocking with the candidate is a whole different experience, because they will actually get into conversations with voters, and try to persuade them."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,drhuge12,5,Tue Jul 14 00:56:22 2015 UTC,"I used to, many years ago, volunteer with my grandmother (who is a blue-blooded, hardcore CPC member) at major CPC events out in the valley. Including that time (though there's probably been more than one) where PM Harper visited the ranch out on 8th Ave here in the GVRD.   Overall? Pretty 'blah' experience. I honestly couldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't discourage it either. Just don't go into it thinking that you're going to be like a West Wing cast member. It's a lot more mundane."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,drhuge12,8,Mon Jul 13 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"To be perfectly honest volunteer for a campaign is usually mind numbing and boring work.  It revolves around cold calling, door knocking and data collection/data entry.  Unless you have an established reputation on previous campaigns, are part of the riding association executive, or have a personal connection with the candidate, you are pretty much a cog in the machine.  You are not going to be asked to come up with campaign strategy, or implement policy decisions, you will not be privy to backroom decision making and you will be very very far away from anything that remotely resembles real big P-politics.  Volunteering on campaigns is where you establish your reputation and prove how hard a worker you are.  If you show up and volunteer you will get lots of face-time with your candidate, but your candidate will probably be too busy trying to get out the vote, so he won't be engaging you in any detailed policy talks.  If you are good volunteer - IE you show up when you say you'll show up, efficient with your time phone calling, door knocking, and your campaign manager likes you etc etc. you will be invited to cool events with VIPs and MPs - if that's what your into."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,jtbc,3,Mon Jul 13 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely all of this. OP, if you're interested in politics, this is where you start making connections and proving that you're a capable worker."

You meet cool people (usually), get free snacks, see more of your community on foot than you would otherwise; I would totally recommend it.   Some things to keep in mind: don't get too caught up in federal horserace stuff and keep your attention focused on your community when you're volunteering, and very importantly, always be kind and courteous to people volunteering for other parties. They're usually all nice people and concerned citizens; don't bring that famous Ottawa vitriol home with you (candidates bear a lot of responsibility for setting the tone on this, though)."
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,Iustis,3,Mon Jul 13 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"I volunteered during a byelection a few years ago. I did doorknocking, sign waving, sign delivery, and drove people to the polls. I knew the candidate (who did not win) so got a little bit of backstage access. The candidate put up a good fight uphill, but lost.  The experience hooked me on politics, so I have since been volunteering regularly with the Liberals for a couple of years now. If you show up reliably, work hard, and show interest, you will more than likely be given more responsibility and training, at least the way the Liberals are doing things. I still do doorknocking because its fun, but have branched out into fundraising, organizing events, and some other stuff with a specific campaign.  I find it very rewarding, sometimes even more so than my day job."

CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,Political_Junky,3,Tue Jul 14 03:21:45 2015 UTC,I'm the campaign manager's slave assistant.  What I need from a volunteer is this in the most basic sense: -Phone canvassing -Door canvassing -Warm body for an event  Beyond that there is opportunity if you're not an idiot and I can trust you. -Correspondence if you can write -Canvassing with the candidate if you're charismatic -All my IT woes if you can computer  Ya I'm blunt but I'm drunk on a Tuesday morning.  And yes I got my job from volunteering and I enjoy my busy existence now. So it does pay off?
CanadaPolitics,3d69gy,uogeegee,3,Tue Jul 14 05:21:25 2015 UTC,"I honestly think I can recommend it (even if it just mundane door knocking etc.).  I think it can be fairly enjoyable (even just walking around on a nice day can be nice).  But I also think it is really useful as a perspective on the electorate - I would be lying if I did not say it has made me a lot more cynical.  It is so easy spending time on somewhere like /r/canadapolitics (hell even /r/canada) and getting a distorted view of people's engagement with politics.  I still think it is worth it, and it is not bad, but I would love to force everyone who wants to implement mandatory voting to canvass for at least 3 hours."

The city would need an additional billion in infrastructure spending just to get to the point where they would have a credible bid -- the US Olympic Committee is warning them that they'll transfer the option to Los Angeles if Boston cannot get it together. That really leaves no viable North American option....  So, should Toronto bid? Why not? We have much of the needed infrastructure ready and could easily put in place the remaining affairs. Toronto would be an excellent host city and looking at other 2024 contenders, we seem like we'd be in for a good shot.

CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,kselick,21,Mon Jul 13 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"Two enormous issues here. One involves funky math, the other involves a lot of huffing and puffing about non-existent religious discrimination.   Funky Math   Nobody has ever demonstrated that graduates of TWU law school would discriminate against gay clients. Ontario’s Human Rights Code would prevent that anyhow. Nor has it been suggested that TWU grads wouldn’t be competent lawyers. Indeed, TWU has a reputation for high academic standards.    Right, they didn't. Who cares. The LSUC was concerned with its statutory obligation to protect equality and the public interest, not with the competency of TWU's graduates.    With glaring illogic, the court said that being ineligible for a position at TWU law school would make it more difficult for gay students to gain access to the legal profession. There are 9,000 applicants annually for only 2,782 spots at Canadian law schools.   Well, since we're on the subject of ""glaring illogic..."" First of all, I have literally no idea where she is getting this 9,000 number. Pre or post Lakehead and Thompson Rivers?    But if TWU opens up (for example) 150 more places, then even if those places get filled by non-gays, it still means that there will be less competition for the other 2,782 spots. Now only 8,850 people will be competing for those spots, so the odds of getting accepted are better. The accreditation of TWU law school would therefore make it more likely, rather than less, that gay candidates in the pool of 9,000 will get accepted.    Some funky math here, and breathtakingly dishonest at that. Consider the number of spots available now as X. Consider the number of spots at TWU Law as Y. The number of spots available for straights will be X + Y, and the number of spots available for non-straights will be X. She's basically assuming that straight people will no longer attend law schools other than TWU. Sure, opening another law school, notionally -- if we accept that the number of applicants and the number of places elsewhere stay static -- means that there is marginally less competition for X seats, but as you can see straight people are competing for X seats too. That's not improving the field for gays, its notionally improving the field for everyone, while straight people have one option among many that gay people don't have.   And this is a ridiculous argument for a lawyer to make given the realities of the profession. BC is already struggling to avoid an Ontario-type situation with its articling bottleneck, and I suspect if TWU law were to open the other universities would reduce their class sizes.   Lastly, I reject, as did the LSUC and the Ontario Superior Court, this reprehensible numbers game. From the judgment:    Discrimination is not evaluated on a numbers basis.  It should be self-evident that, since discrimination is usually directed at minorities, the number of people who experience the effect of discrimination will be fewer in number than the people who are the source of the discrimination.  Discriminatory actions are no less discriminatory because they only effect a few rather than many.    And now it gets really strange:    The Law Society has engaged in blatant religious discrimination purportedly to prevent future discrimination by TWU grads based on sexual orientation   Wait, didn't she already concede that this wasn't the case? Because... it isn't. They expressly did not purport to do that. Is this an editing problem or am I desperately confused.    This issue has split the legal community across Canada, but the Law Society never polled its 47,000 members to see what we think. The vote among the Society’s own directors (called benchers) was only 56 per cent against accreditation. But the benchers themselves were elected with a voter turnout of only 37 per cent. So it’s possible that as few as 21 per cent of Law Society members approve of what our organization has done.    Again with the bizarre math. It's within the same range of possibility  that as many as 99 percent of them approve it. Maybe she should take a look at the BC Law Society referendum: 5,951 lawyers voted against, 2,088, for. I don't know anything to suggest that Ontario would be different. But it doesn't really matter because the merits of the goal of equality is not subject to a popular vote -- that's kind of the point.   Huffing and puffing  The other noteworthy things is a strange focus on what the author sees as religious discrimination, which evinces significant confusion as to who is doing what to whom.   Let's be clear. LSUC is an administrative body governing the practice of law in Ontario. It is governed and empowered by the Legal Profession Act. It decided not to accredit TWU so its graduates could automatically practice law in Ontario. This writer doesn't like that:   But we can’t quit in protest, because if we did we couldn’t practice law. Adding insult to injury, we lawyers are compelled by law to pay for the “service” of being governed by people who may force profoundly antithetical views upon us.    Yes, you are compelled by law -- you have been for centuries. The practice of law is ancient, honourable and requires levels of trust and integrity. It's a self governing profession. You can't just go off to University of Phoenix online and start drafting wills. And the bigger issue here: How on God's green earth are views being imposed on the writer by this decision? I don't understand it! She's an Ontario lawyer, and a decision has been made to not accredit a BC university ... how is that an imposition of a view onto her?    ...to violate the religious freedom of Trinity Western University ...   TWU and one of its students went to court hoping to have their constitutional right to religious freedom upheld  ... it would allow the Law Society to get away with violating the Charter rights of TWU.  The Law Society has engaged in blatant religious discrimination   Ok, here are my thoughts:   Preventing one group from having special privileges to exclude other groups, while maintaining all of its standard rights and privileges is not discrimination. Christian students can still go to UVic and UBC.  TWU is not a natural person and doesn't have Charter rights.  LSUC didn't send in the bulldozers and demolish TWU. TWU can still open a law school. They can still teach Canadian law. They can still offer a JD or llb program. Their graduates just won't be accredited to practice in Ontario. They can still form whatever religious community they want, but any religous right they have doesn't oblige LSUC to allow their graduates to practice law in Ontario. The suggestion seems to be that Ontario's legal profession isn't allowed to govern itself if someone, somewhere, is believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And yeah, sure, religious Charter values are at play. But also, you know, equality. LSUC balanced those values. They and the Court did so using the Doré analysis.  They found that whatever religious rights TWU have are not absolute and untrammelled. You can't do whatever you want because you're motivated by religious belief, and arresting behaviour (that, for example, you have a statutory mandate to arrest) is not forbidden because that behaviour is motivated by religious belief. I assume this writer is in favour of not giving amnesty to the perpetrators of honour killings, and does not view the prosecution of the same as ""religious discrimination.""  Telling people they can't do a bad thing isn't discrimination just because those people are motivated by religious belief to do it."
CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,macamareva,9,Mon Jul 13 20:39:14 2015 UTC,Another thing to tack onto this.  I believe that TWU graduates would still be free to go through NCA exams and then work in Ontario.  If they just received a top quality Canadian Legal Education this should not be a problem for them.
CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,Iustis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"It's still a problem where most law school students apply for articling positions during second year and not after graduation (and writing NCA exams).  As well, I don't get this, but how would forcing law students from TWU to write an additional test in any way alleviate any discrimination against LGBT students? The school is still allowed to teach and have their covenant, but this just seems like a discriminatory measure against graduates for choosing to go to a religious school. LGBT students also sometimes don't get into law school and also have to choose second choice law schools so how is this any less discriminatory?"
CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,LicencetoShill007,10,Tue Jul 14 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"TWU is not a natural person and doesn't have Charter rights.    That one doesn't really fly.

Otherwise, a church (also not a natural person) wouldn't have Charter rights.   Sorry, I went full Joel Bakan for a minute there. Yes, legal persons have some, but not all, Charter rights (including IIRC the freedom of association which starts with ""everyone,"" but not including s. 15 the freedom of equality, which is more important because she keeps alleging that religious discrimination has occurred). But like you say, it doesn't make any sense b/c the freedom of association isn't even engaged here.    What matters is that the Ontario court noted that none of TWU's rights were actually infringed, which you get into with your subsequent points.   Well, not exactly, and the exactness makes all the difference, and makes this ""their rights were violated"" argument nonsensical.   What the Ontario Court did was a Doré analysis, which does not enquire whether a right has been infringed, per se. It looks at whether a ""Charter value"" has been limited. Charter values are much looser than Charter rights. That's why this argument doesn't make that much sense. Clearly ""Charter values"" are engaged here but not clearly Charter rights. If there was an ""Oakes"" type analysis done I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be able to find an infringement of s. 2(d), like I said."

Some funky math here. . . That's not improving the field for gays, its notionally improving the field for everyone, while straight people have one option among many that gay people don't have.    The ruling argued that it would now be overall harder for lgbt students to find a law placement, which she correctly argued was misleading. Also, you understand that probably 90-95% of straight students wouldn't want to go to a school that is overly religious and bans both drinking and non-marital stress right? It's designed for Evangelical students who (though I'm not one, I can definitely see why they would have a hard time at law school. Religion and Christianity can be mocked without repercussion there, while nobody would tolerate any kind of anti-homophobic remark).   I suspect if TWU law were to open the other universities would reduce their class sizes.    No school would ever do that, the bottle neck is from too many school adding seats and none ever takes any away.

She's an Ontario lawyer, and a decision has been made to not accredit a BC university ... how is that an imposition of a view onto her?    If it went the other way people would be complaining just as hard that the decision imposes an view they don't agree with. You're only looking at one side of the issue making your comments no better than hers.    Preventing one group from having special privileges to exclude other groups, while maintaining all of its standard rights and privileges is not discrimination. Christian students can still go to UVic and UBC.     How is this an argument for not accrediting TWU? LGBT students can still go to UVic and UBC.    TWU is not a natural person and doesn't have Charter rights.     The Charter right of Freedom of religion applies to legal entities too, see the foundational case of R v Big M Drug Mart.   The suggestion seems to be that Ontario's legal profession isn't allowed to govern itself if someone, somewhere, is believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.   Did that sound not offensive when you wrote it? Imagine if you replaced that with belittling gay rights for example.    They found that whatever religious rights TWU have are not absolute and untrammelled.     Did you really compare the freedom to open an effective law school based around your honestly held religious beliefs, where nobody is forced to apply with honour killings? Seriously, you can't even look at the other side which is apparent with your criticism but if you could look at everything you wrote objectively you would see how you and the author are two sides of the same coin."

However, they want to do things, namely discriminate, based on that belief. They don't have the right to do anything they want based on their religious belief.    If it went the other way people would be complaining just as hard that the decision imposes an view they don't agree with. You're only looking at one side of the issue making your comments no better than hers.   No, back it up here. I literally don't understand how the decision of a law society to refuse to accredit a law school is the imposition of that view on lawyers of the province. If they went the other way i would profoundly disagree but it wouldn't be the ""imposition of view.""    How is this an argument for not accrediting TWU? LGBT students can still go to UVic and UBC.   Yes, everyone can go to UVic and UBC... but gay students wouldn't be able to go to TWU. That's kind of the whole point. Nobody is excluding Christian students from a law school.    The Charter right of Freedom of religion applies to legal entities too, see the foundational case of R v Big M Drug Mart.   But IIRC it doesn't apply to s.15, so why does she keep talking about religious discrimination?    Did you really compare the freedom to open an effective law school based around your honestly held religious beliefs, where nobody is forced to apply with honour killings?   Yes, I did, and I made the grounds of my comparison quite clear. You, and TWU, are suggesting that TWU should be able to do a certain thing because they are motivated their religious belief and to deny them would offend their religious freedom. My point of that lots of people are motivated by their religious beliefs to do things -- ""because religioun"" isn't an effective argument to excuse blameworthy behaviour.    if you could look at everything you wrote objectively you would see how you and the author are two sides of the same coin.   In the sense that we apparently disagree? Nah, I just don't think fundamentally that the existence of a particular religious community in British Columbia obliges the LSUC to cease to exist as a self-governing entity."
CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,macamareva,2,Tue Jul 14 10:00:01 2015 UTC,"The talk of ""religious discrimination"" doesn't hold any water when it's easy to draw this line of thought:   If TWU expects students to adhere to its own version of ""christian values"", which are themselves intolerant and discriminatory, then one might suspect that JUST MAYBE they would try to churn out grads who will practice and interpret law through those same ""values"".  This, to me, is an even greater concern than the school discriminating against students who aren't likely to wish to apply to attend there."
CanadaPolitics,3d5ufc,arvy_p,2,Tue Jul 14 13:39:49 2015 UTC,"I might have supported TWU if not for two simple statements in the Community Covenent agreement that all students must sign:   observe modesty, purity and appropriate intimacy in all relationships, reserve sexual expressions of intimacy for marriage, and within marriage take every reasonable step to resolve conflict and avoid divorce sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman   These statements combine show a clear lack of understanding of the law in canada in that Marriage between any two adult human beings is legal in canada. With the statement ""sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman"" being in bad taste of Canadian law.   So why would any ethical law society even consider allowing a graduate from TWU to hold a license when the university disregards it themselves.  ""Healthy Sexuality People face significant challenges in practicing biblical sexual health within a highly sexualized culture. A biblical view of sexuality holds that a person’s decisions regarding his or her body are physically, spiritually and emotionally inseparable. Such decisions affect a person’s ability to live out God’s intention for wholeness in relationship to God, to one’s (future) spouse, to others in the community, and to oneself. Further, according to the Bible, sexual intimacy is reserved for marriage between one man and one woman, and within that marriage bond it is God’s intention that it be enjoyed as a means for marital intimacy and procreation. Honouring and upholding these principles, members of the TWU community strive for purity of thought and relationship, respectful modesty, personal responsibility for actions taken, and avoidance of contexts where temptation to compromise would be particularly strong.""  http://twu.ca/studenthandbook/university-policies/community-covenant-agreement.html"

The quarter needs to go, to make even decimals of the dollar easy to use. The only reason we have nickles right now is quarters. We need to go: dime - 50 cent - dollar - toonie. Everything ends in an even zero that way. After a while, the dime would get phased out too. Coins are meant to be used daily for purchases, not for pocket-carrying and rounding.  ...  Besides, after enough time we'll go to all-electronic anyways (way, way down the road)"
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,ManofManyTalentz,2,Mon Jul 13 18:58:10 2015 UTC,I'm confused. What is wrong with the nickel?
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,CisPrivileged,3,Mon Jul 13 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"Well, it has to do fundamentally with what the point of having coins is. They were designed to be able to carry a certain amount of purchasing power. The idea is the things you buy most often (bread, milk etc)  should be purchasable with just one coin. Think 1920s where a coffee was a nickle. Now a nickle is useless due to inflation and it has zero purchasing power. So, the coins need to be bumped up to account for inflation and restore their purchasing power.   The ideal situation then would be nothing ending in five cents and only ten cents, so the ideal coins right now would be twoonie, loonie , fifty cent and dime."
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,ManofManyTalentz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:48:11 2015 UTC,so once you phase the dime out we just hope we break even on the rounding of cents off each purchase? But If I buy the same thing everyday on the wrong end of the rounding I'll always be losing 20 cents a purchase and not make it back up on a different purchase later.
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,djn808,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:01:30 2015 UTC,"So you're making two assumptions: You're only buying one thing ever in your life over and over. The other is that the 20 cents are worth anything at all. The dime would have to be displaced much later on, as arguably it still has some value.  You're never buying anything else again? Ever. This is the same argument as the penny, except that it's a dime. It'll be the same deal: mathematically it's been proven, beyond what ""makes sense"", that the averaging does round off, and if it's a specific company making the purchase, electronically it's counting the pennies anyways. Otherwise, the market will self-correct to the dimes. This is strictly a consumer bill."
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,ManofManyTalentz,53,Tue Jul 14 10:44:31 2015 UTC,"I thought this would be an interesting exercise, and spent some good time googling ""Harper government accomplishments"". I found a number of things that CPC supporters would count as positives, mostly either economic or foreign relations related. I can't agree on most of those, so let's put them aside.  I think CETA may turn out to be a good thing. The devil is in the details, and I'm not familiar enough with those to say for sure, but broadly, I think they'll be able to chalk this up in the ""good for Canada"" column.  Income Trusts - I probably don't know enough about this, but I was very much against Harper's promise to preserve them, and was pleasantly surprised when he changed his mind.  /u/aceofhicks mentioned eliminating the penny. It may sound like faint praise, but it was about time.  Aside from that - I gave this the old college try, and while I did find things that some might consider positives (stance with the UN, Israel, various middle east policies) I could not find a single other policy where I could honestly say that I thought they did the right thing.  For the record, I can not say the same for the last Tory government.  Mulroney instituted the GST, which cost him politically, but I think was the right decision. Increased support for national parks. The Meech Lake accord didn't succeed, but I think it was a good effort, count that as you will. NAFTA wasn't a full win (softwood, water), but as these things go was perhaps as good as could be expected and came out better than not. His stance against apartheid and intervention in Nicaragua were commendable, even though it put him against the US and UK.  I mention Mulroney only because I want it to be clear that I'm trying to come at this from a non-partisan place. I cast my first federal vote for Mulroney. While I don't think I'd make that same decision today, I can say that I don't regret that vote."
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,conflare,31,Mon Jul 13 02:02:53 2015 UTC,Mulroney also negotiated the Acid Rain Treaty and brought in the Environmental Protection Act.

While the US and Britain were still in the 80s and early 90s locked into a scorched earth Anti-Communist agenda Mulroney was trying to support and spoke out in favor of the Anti-Apartheid movement in Africa that other Western powers believed was only a front for communists.  Something I think this Government could be proud of but honestly they aren't is helping to broker a dialog between Cuba and the United States. But their heavy handed media control and the fact that it doesn't play to their base means it's not something they see as favorable or 'good'.

As a results, these forests are calcium starved, and have not grown, at all, for decades. As those trees die of natural causes they will not be replaced.

It is literally the only thing they have done that I could think of except for maybe the penny.   The fact that our government does things I do not like or approve of does not make Putin's Russia less of a threat. Frankly, my evaluation of the appropriateness of their response might be poor - foreign policy and diplomacy are not areas that I consider personal strengths.   My thought process is as follows: I believe Russia is a threat as I have a friend who does business with senior Russian officials. It was explained to him that Russians are not happy with the outcomes of the First and Second World Wars and the Cold War. It rankles the senior oligarchs very much and they want to push the limits of international tolerance as far as they can to reclaim territory. We have seen evidence of this in the Russian incursions in South Ossetia, Chechnya and the Ukraine.   The second part of my evaluation is simply the fact that policies of appeasement do not have a great tradition of success.   The third issue I consider is that we have Northern territory with natural resources - we need to define and undertake the necessary action to establish our northern territory as part of our sovereign lands.   The final aspect of my evaluation is that Canada is a prominent western nation but we really are not all that threatening to Russia. If the US is too aggressive with Russia, war really does hang in the balance.

Sounds very much like ""bears-on-unicycles stereotype"", Russia never had any political or territorial claims or disputes with Canada. I do not think outcome of First or Second World Wars are relevant anymore. It may have an appetite to have an economic and political influence on former USSR countries, but only because it maintains assets in these countries to this day. Ukraine had military bases that were agreed to be used by Russia after USSR collapse, South Ossetia was/is a sleeping conflict since 90s, Chechnya was a militant Islamic insurgency on Russian territory and never seceded form Russia, even during the 90s.  Any attempts to try an position Russia as potential aggressor for the rest of the world is the result of a few spin doctors working for US military sector.    The second part of my evaluation is simply the fact that policies of appeasement do not have a great tradition of success.   Appeasements are not taking place anymore.

Urban ridings will likely not go to the conservatives no matter what so they had nothing to lose. Suburban voters who are more likely to vote conservative are pleased by the cost-saving at someone else's expense for a situation they perceive to unfair (that new houses have boxes but old ones have door-to-door). Also the most negative repercussions from the community boxes (e.g. the impossibility of the boxes in areas like the Plateau in Montreal) will only be felt after the next election.

(It would be great if we could get rid of the principal residence capital gains exemption, but I know that would be rather unpopular politically... TFSAs at least slightly level the playing field between homeowners and non-homeowners.)  As other people have said, getting rid of the penny was a smart move.  I think the stimulus spending was well done, but it would have been nice if Harper hadn't needed to be pushed into it by the opposition parties threatening to bring down the government.  Bringing the ""Royal"" back to the air force and navy isn't something which affects me in the slightest, but it sounds like the affected military personnel appreciate regaining their historical designations, so I count that as a positive.  I'm glad they care about free trade, and I'm happy that the wheat board was abolished; I wish they would go further and kill off the dairy quota/tariff system, both because it's standing in the way of free trade deals and because it's an idiotic and regressive system anyway.

It came too late in effect for me to use this policy but I do think it was a very positive change, as it reduces the burden on both students and the government to simply give an almost automatic permit.  In general they current government has kept the allowances and programs for international students to work during school, remain legally in Canada after graduation and eventually find a path towards permanent residence if they so wish. This contrast greatly with other countries, like the UK which is looking to end international students working and ending post-grad work permits, making them leave the UK upon graduation and applying for a regular work visa from abroad."
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,weecdngeer,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:42 2015 UTC,"The single greatest policy impact to our family is income splitting, or at least the attempt at income splitting. As a single income family, the prior tax code seemed like a penalty based to how we chose to raise our kids. My brother and his wife make roughly equivalent to my income, but are able to pay substantially less tax, plus write off child care payments. I support our household on my income at higher tax rate and the work my husband does in caring for our kids isn't tax deductible in any way. With respect to the argument that income splitting is a tax benefit to the wealthy only/primarily, professionals can already set up professional corporations to split income rather easily (I'm too risk averse to be comfortable with that option) but tradespeople like my husband's former co-workers are generally stuck under the standard code. This policy levels the playing field, IMO. I'd love it if they'd move to true income splitting (taxation by household rather than individual), but the current policy is a step in the right direction, IMO.  I'm not a Harper cheerleader by any means, but I do think that we've weathered some rocky economic times in better shape than some of our peers under his direction."

CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,kofclubs,7,Mon Jul 13 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"The extremes of the argument were both very vocal, both in favour and opposed to the monopoly. I'm not going to stand here and say that every farmer in the west was opposed to the monopoly but a lot of farmers in my area anyway wanted to be able to sell their grain where they wanted to. It also rankled that Prairie grain farmers were required to go through the Board monopoly but Eastern and BC farmers weren't.  The fact is, it was never about eliminating the CWB, it was about getting rid of the marketing monopoly the Board held. There should be no reason for a farmer who has the means and ambition to go shopping for the best price for his grain to sell it to whomever he damn well pleases. The Board monopoly was an anachronism from a time when your average farm was a fraction of the size it is today and farmers didn't have the means to sell their grain to anyone beyond their local elevator. Today, even a so-called ""small farmer"" has the means to make a deal with any grain company within hundreds of miles and ship their grain at volume without needing to go through the elevator middle men.  The Board still exists and if, as we were told over and over again during the debate about the monopoly, ""the majority of farmers want to deal with the CWB"" then it should make no difference whether the Board has a monopoly or not. The guys who want to deal with the Board continue to do so, and the ones who want to shop around for the best prices can do so as well.  For what it's worth, I'm not wild about the government selling controlling stake in the Board to a foreign company; it would have been worth keeping ownership in the company, either keeping a majority of it government owned or offering shares to farmers or something like that."

CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,kofclubs,2,Mon Jul 13 17:11:48 2015 UTC,"I think whether or not bringing the CWB back in some form is misguided is up for debate.    Not really, most farmers didn't want it.  My family farms grains in Ontario and thankfully there's no idea's to resurrect our outdated wheat board that was disbanded in 2003.  If you ask users like Vorocano or other former CWB farmers they'd tell you the same, there's always going to be some that want it back, but not a majority.  Thats also 2011, the 2015 Ag policy looks like something on /r/conspiracy.  They're not listening to farmers and they're blatantly ignoring Ag scientists.  From the 2015 platform:   f Requiring that research on the safety of GM food on our health and the environment be conducted by independent and unbiased (unaffiliated with industry) scientists.   I guess they've never bothered to actually look at studies, much less an internet site that lists them:   The results show that independent peer-reviewed research on GMOs is common, conducted worldwide, and makes up half of the total of all research on risks associated with genetic engineering.   http://genera.biofortified.org/wp/genera-announces-beta-test-launch  That site also posts independent studies, sorry but I get a good laugh when someone tells me there isn't independent studies and that their isn't a scientific consensus on GMO's, let alone put that in their policy.     Encouraging ecologically-sustainable practices by supporting organic practices and crop diversity, reducing the use of pesticides and herbicides, banning terminator seeds, improving the collection and disposal of waste materials, and conserving wooded buffer zones.   First, terminator seeds have never been used and will never be used or approved for usage, why someone wants to waste time banning them is just pandering to the uninformed.  Switching to organic lowers yields which will increase food prices, as will adding a GMO label. In many cases Organic is not better for the environment, the pesticides can be much worse since they're not synthetic. Also farmers could lose things like no-till, soil erosion is one of the biggest issues facing farmers so it would actually have a negative effect on the environment, not a positive as those that buy into this would think.  We'd also need more land to make up for lost yields. The other thing is this plays on the idea that organic is healthier, anyone who follows Ag science knows this isn't true, its a marketing gimmick.  Sorry but if you think farmers like the NDP Ag policy you're not reading Ag news but activist news.  Or pseudo science out of this activists mouth.  Its ironic that some champion the NDP for climate change when their Ag policy does the opposite and actually hurts the poor by driving food costs up."
CanadaPolitics,3d2lhg,conflare,2,Mon Jul 13 01:58:02 2015 UTC,"There is so much nonsense and misinformation around GMOs and organic crops. (I'm certainly not against the idea of growing organic crops, but there's more nuance there than I care to get into at the moment). Never mind that the organic label doesn't mean what most seem to think it means.  There are some issues that ""the left"" (or certain segments) have latched on to that are fairly embarrassing, many of the myths surrounding GMOs being one of them. I have some concerns around it, but those are mostly related to corporate influence on important crops and their behaviour in developing nations. I think there are some legitimate concerns that need to be addressed, but nonsense like getting cancer from GMO foods overshadows them and we end up not having the real discussion.  I'm not sure about your characterization of The Western Producer (that I linked to above) or the Canadian Farmer's Association as activist or pseudo scientific, though.

It would also leave them open to criticism for being too left and anti-science on this issue.  But yes, there's so many myths and marketing around farming that I'm not surprised that most are frustrated.    I didn't see a Western Producer article, although I read it regularly.  My family has memberships to OFA, CFA, GFO, etc. but I've never seen the CFA be pro-organic and anti-GMO, its why I think the article is before Mulcair and when the NDP changed their position.  I don't believe Layton was, but not 100% on that.  CBAN, NFU, are leftist organizations and I'm sure you know the Ontario Land Owners on the right.

Rail cars isn't really an issue for many farmers these days either, as most of the farmers who ship to the States truck it to elevators and grain companies down there.

It goes to an inland terminal or small elevator, who then ship by rail. Those big terminals handle upwards of 100 rail cars in one shipment, whereas your average small town elevator when the Board was created did maybe 10-20. Rail movement is important to the grain industry, that's true. It is the major way that the grain leaves the terminals and gets to the ports. I will admit that I worded it poorly in my post just above this. What I should have said is that removing the Board monopoly doesn't hurt farmers in terms of rail movement because most farmers ship their grain to a big Viterra or P&H or JRI terminal to be part of a giant 100,000 tonne shipment anyway.  The quota legislation was put into place because CN and CP weren't interested in shipping any grain; they were too busy shipping crude oil and intermodal containers."

It may be that such farmers are a vanishingly small minority, but no effort was made to find out what the numbers on such farmers are. 20 years ago, absolutely there was no way to farm on the prairies without a permit book. But now with the rise in acreage of new crops like corn and soybeans, at least here in Manitoba, it's far easier to farm without dealing with wheat and barley.  And you could grow certain varieties of wheat and barley without a permit book, you'd just have to sell them for feed wheat or malting barley."

If, as you say, the majority of farmers loved the CWB then they should continue going strong as a commodity company for many many years to come.  Care to elaborate on the ""lot of negative consequences?"" Prices are pretty similar to what they've always been. Yes, wheat prices tanked after the CWB monopoly was eliminated, but that has a lot more to do with the bumper crop that came in that year than anything else."

It just becomes another grain trader, as we've seen. The question was never whether the farmers supported the CWB as an organization, it was whether they supported the CWB monopoly.    If, as you say, the majority of farmers loved the CWB then they should continue going strong   Trying to say that farmers supported removing the CWB monopoly because they didn't continue to support it after it lost its raison d'etre is totally disingenuous."

This is a tremendously ... ignorant argument, to pick the least colourful of the adjectives I'm considering.  The Bank of Canada does not have a mandate to serve property owners in Vancouver and Toronto.  Its express monetary policy objective is to keep inflation ""low, stable, and predictable,"" which in practice means it targets a 2% inflation rate within a 1% range on either side.  If inflation falls below that rate or is projected to do so over the medium term, then the Bank of Canada must cut interest rates or otherwise conduct monetary easing.  Monetary policy is a very blunt tool.  It cannot be used to fine-tune the composition of an economy, which is what these ""housing bubble"" arguments implicitly argue for.  Not properly setting monetary policy to avoid a housing bubble is akin to setting Loblaws on fire to reduce junk food consumption.  What's worse is that this argument ignores recent history.  The Bank of Sweden (Riksbank) attempted to do just this.  It raised the policy interest rate by about 2% between 2010 and 2011, on fears of unsustainable levels of debt (especially including household and housing debt).  At the time, the Riksbank was unconcerned with the fragility of a recovery and the currently-low inflation rate.  Following textbook economics, the Swedish economy entered into a renewed recession.  This one was so deep that the Riksbank had to undo all of its interest rate increase and more, officially entering the realm of negative interest rates earlier this year.  That housing bubble got even more pronounced, and the Swedish people endured years of unnecessary suffering for all that ""success.""  If we as a society are so blooming concerned with a housing bubble that we're willing to bludgeon the economy to death, then we should regulate the damn market before that more drastic solution.  Reduce mortgage amortization periods to 15 years on 5-year mortgages, and the government will stop any housing bubble in its tracks without a rate change.   The true risk of a housing bubble isn't in some mysterious ""pop"", it's in what happens when mortgage payments become unaffordable.  That risk is magnified for long-amortization, low-interest mortgages, where a small change in the rate can result in a large payment change at mortgage renewal."

Basically I'm wondering if a rate cut does anything to the economy when lenders don't pass it on, and as a corollary if that means lenders are simply lining their pockets with the rate cut in that instance.   Question for the economists. When the main lenders don't pass on a rate cut to consumers, what is the effect of a rate cut? When the BoC cut rates by .25% in January, did it effectively result in the banks charging prime + 1.25% instead of prime +1% on a given mortgage?  Beyond that specific example, does a BoC rate cut actually do anything for the broader economy when the main lenders don't pass it on?   It remains relevant, given the article's concluding question:   The last rate cut did little to change any of this. Will another on Wednesday do a better job for the economy?"

Yes, the rate cut still does something.  First of all, the rate cut will still influence government debt.  If all else fails, this is where it can affect the real economy, since governments will need to obtain less money through taxation and bond issues to fund operations.  It would be a relatively small effect, but it would still act as de facto fiscal policy.   if that means lenders are simply lining their pockets with the rate cut in that instance.   That's also an effect, from a macroeconomic standpoint.  First of all, to ""line their pockets,"" this means that lenders would have to borrow from the Bank of Canada and issue private loans.  Even if they do not otherwise change their private-debt rates, increasing the quantity of loans for investment (ideally) or consumption (less ideally) has a macroeconomic effect.  Even in the worst case of no new aggregate loans, just what will banks do with their new pocket lining?  They're not using the capital to underwrite new loans (by assumption in this paragraph), so they're either investing in their own business or returning the profits as dividends.  New investment is still economic activity, and money returned as dividends is still new money in private hands for use on whatever.  We would hope that a BoC rate cut would have a broad-based impact on the economy, but a narrow impact is still better than no impact.  Since rate cuts are a blunt instrument (see my other post), it's up to the remainder of the financial system + government regulation to make the best of it."

I'm not sure I understand. Couldn't the lenders simply maintain the same lending rules as before, in which case any new loan would net them a greater profit against the BoC's rates than before (or do they not borrow from the BoC very often?)? So they wouldn't necessarily lend any more than they were previously, and there would be no greater incentive for consumers to increase their lending because they're still being asked to pay the same rates, and so in effect the banks are making more money while overall lending is not being increased?"
CanadaPolitics,3d3dv5,insanity_irt_reality,2,Mon Jul 13 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Couldn't the lenders simply maintain the same lending rules as before, in which case any new loan would net them a greater profit against the BoC's rates than before (or do they not borrow from the BoC very often?   The headline rate is really the interbank rate, or the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other.  This is really a wash in terms of bank profits, since it means that a greater profit at RBC (since it can borrow reserves at a lower rate than it charges for loans) means a lower profit at (say) TD (which would lend reserves at a now lower rate).  The Bank of Canada also sets a Bank Rate for overnight loans it makes to commercial banks.  Lowering this rate would be where possibly increased profit comes into play, if the banking system as a whole has borrowed from the Bank of Canada to issue loans.  Finally, the Bank of Canada also has a Deposit Rate, which is the rate it pays banks for their reserves.  This rate will also go down, and in so doing it decreases the profit earned by banks on money that's ""sitting there"" as reserves.  A bank earns more profit from your savings account when rates are high, rather than when rates are low.  Your deposit gives the bank reserves, and the deposit is a 0-interest liability (since you can take it out at any time, the bank owes you that money).  The bank earns the deposit rate on that reserve (if it holds on to it), the interbank rate (if it lends it to another bank), one of a few investment rates (if it uses the reserves to buy government or corporate bonds), or the bank's prime rate (if it uses the reserve to issue a new loan).  In all of these cases, the Bank of Canada lowering rates means the profit on your deposit does not increase.  Banks ultimately make their profits by borrowing short-term (overnight loans from the BoC or other banks, or deposits that can be redeemed at any time) and lending long-term (mortgages, credit cards, bonds -- things that can't be called in at a moment's notice).  It's that interest rate spread, more than any single rate, that influences bank profits."
CanadaPolitics,3d3dv5,Majromax,2,Mon Jul 13 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"I'm having trouble following as I feel like you went a bit off track with deposits and interbank lending, but it seems that your answer is: yes, the increased interest rate spread on banks paying less to borrow short-term following a BoC overnight lending rate cut and still charging the same on long-term lending would effectively lead to greater profits by the banks.  The reason I say the bit on deposits was offtrack is that they aren't really where banks make their money - banks make the lion's share of their profits on lending. Don't they?  And the reason I say the bit on interbank lending was offtrack is that it's a wash, as you said, and not really relevant to the question which was much more focused on what you covered in the latter portion of your comment. It's interesting, but not specifically relevant to the question. Fair?"

The problem here is that banks don't borrow from the Bank of Canada long-term.  The bank rate is used to manage temporary positions like large withdrawals of savings, but as far as I am aware no bank maintains a permanent overdraft with the Bank of Canada.  Think of it this way: banks borrow overnight at currently 1% (0.75% target rate plus 0.25%). The only risk-free asset they can put that in is really Government of Canada bonds, but short-term bonds yield about 0.5%.  There's only loss in that.  Banks cannot take long-term loan positions with short-term Bank of Canada funding without breaking regulations in terms of capital requirements.  Bank loans are an asset to the bank, but they can only be used to justify issuing further loans when priced in a risk-adjusted way.  In the meantime, take a look at the financial statements of a bank.  Picking RBC out of a hat, they report (pdf, page 45) that just over 2/3 of the bank's total liabilities come from deposits."
CanadaPolitics,3d3dv5,Majromax,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"I'm willing to admit that this is hurting my head.  How does an overnight rate cut stimulate the economy, if lenders don't really benefit from it anyway (if that's the point you're making -- it doesn't give them room to lend long-term at a lower rate because it's only temporary for them)? And why do banks generally lower their long-term lending rates to match the BoC's overnight rate if their lending tends to be much more short-term and therefore likely to rise when inflation gets back to 2% or higher?  Edit: following another attempt at re-reading your points, my questions could be better. So when we're told the banks are not passing on the rate cut to consumers, does this mean they're maintaining the status quo interest rates on deposits in addition to status quo on long-term lending rates? Or did they in the very recent example lower interest rates on deposits to match the BoC's 25 basis points cut while maintaining long-term lending rates at a status quo? I think I'm getting closer to getting this...  By the way, I totally understand if this is where we decide to end the conversation since you probably don't have the time to teach me economics 101."
CanadaPolitics,3d3dv5,insanity_irt_reality,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:44 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a carrot and stick approach.  For the carrot, any bank who wants to borrow money can do so at a lower rate.  That means that a long-term asset like a 30-year bond can better support retail loans, since it would cost less money to make up the liquidity difference.  (Liquidity means ""can I spend this now?"" -- yes to cash, no to a bond).  For the stick, the interbank rate gets used as a benchmark for far more than retail lending.  A bank with some excess deposits can issue new loans, lend to another bank, or sock the excess in short-term government bonds.  If the interbank rate goes down, that means that banks will want to put more in higher-yielding vehicles, but the supply of government debt is limited.  The upshot is that dropping the interbank rate will also cause rates on government debt to fall to match.  Right now, the Bank of Canada pays the same interest on reserves that banks can get from 1-year Government of Canada bonds.  If the deposit rate drops further, then you can expect bond yields to drop perfectly in time.  Once that happens, what are banks to do but expand their retail loan operations, offering lower interest rates if necessary?  Retail banking is still moderately competitive; high rates cannot persist forever or else one company would advertise its lower rates and win a bigger marketshare.    That the banks didn't fully drop their prime rate probably means they think that consumer debt is somewhat riskier than before, and that's a different calculus."
CanadaPolitics,3d3dv5,Majromax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:25:49 2015 UTC,"A little fine tuning of the transmission mechanism to note that BoC rates don't directly affect most government borrowing as only the shortest term treasury bill is priced in relation to the prime rate.  Most borrowing occurs further out the yield curve, and while BoC decisions signal anticipated diections for economic growth and inflation, influencing market rates at these maturities, the prices paid by governments (and indeed all borrowers) are ultimately set by the market rather than by the Bank.  The yield curve can rise at the mid or longer end completely independent of monetary policy decisions at the short end pushing in the opposite direction."

""There's an economic element to it, but there's always a political element too.""   Davies comes across as very thoughtful and pragmatic. That's a good thing, as the devil is in the detail on these types of complex deals. On CETA, they've already expressed concerns over the ISDS provisions, among others. These same concerns would no doubt apply equally to the TPP and with good reason. This link goes to an analysis featured recently in the Huffington Post by Bernie Sanders, U.S. Senator (currently running for Democratic Party president nomination). Among other things, Mr. Sanders provides concrete examples of how multinationals have been using ISDS provisions in existing trade deals to challenge implementation by host countries of legislation designed to improve their social and/or environmental outcomes. Not surprising, then, that the NDP have expressed concerns about this.  http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7352166  Something worth bearing in mind, I think, is that the more the world moves toward selling/shipping goods to larger numbers of countries, the more difficult it will be to reduce carbon emissions, as needed, to address global warming. The way I see it, you can't significantly increase activity, output and shipping distances and expect that CO2 emissions will decrease ... At least not until the world has made serious inroads in weaning ourselves off fossil fuels.   In my view the narrative on trade still isn't where it needs to be. If this is something that large portions of the world want to move toward, we need to start including concrete plans to increase trade without jeopardizing our emissions reduction/global warming goals.  The idea on the climate change front is to reduce, not increase, carbon emissions.   A big concern I have about expanding trade, worldwide, is that there doesn't appear to be much thought given to whether it's, in fact, pragmatic to do so AND address climate change simultaneously. In sum, yes, I agree 100% that there is both an economic and a political element to free trade. There's also a climate change element, though, and I'm not convinced that working to elevate other countries' environmental standards piecemeal is  enough. There is also a need to look more globally at the impacts of increased activity and transportation between countries and, presumably, for longer distances than we've seen thus far in the world. If the world's move toward more trade isn't tempered with this type of pragmatic thinking, I fear human kind may very well find that we've been very shortsighted and, in fact, favoured short term economic development over the medium to longer term ability of the planet to sustain life.     fixed typo: replace ""social and/or economic outcomes"" with ""social and/or environmental outcomes"""

CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,d-boom,8,Tue Jul 14 09:32:37 2015 UTC,"There's very little about Mulcair's NDP that's left-wing these days:   The NDP no longer opposes free trade and has indicated they would embrace agreements like the TPP, even if they know said agreements are flawed, if it helps business export more product. Thomas Mulcair believes the 'super rich' already pay enough taxes and he's promised not to raise them. (Even Trudeau is willing to raise taxes on income above $200k at least) Mulcair has said that he believes a combined top marginal tax rate of 50% is fair... yet this amount has already been exceeded in many parts of the country.   How can we ever fund a more fair society when we cap taxes at an amount that's already lower than what many are currently paying?  This is a disgraceful betrayal of NDP policies, Thomas.   Mulcair's small business tax cut will only benefit the wealthy.  How come they get tax cuts but the poor and middle class don't? The NDP's child care plan, like his tax plan, is now disproportionately favored by higher income earners because it also benefits higher income earners the most His chosen method of raising taxes (corporate tax increase) is problematic for several reasons:  1) They are the easiest taxes to avoid/evade  2) Corporate taxes represent just 13.6% of all government revenue so even a significant increase here doesn't generate much extra money  3) Economists have long known that corporate tax increases lead to downward pressure on worker wages, often resulting in lower wages for workers long before the shareholders will accept smaller profits   4) Mulcair doesn't seem to actually know anything about where we stand on corporate taxes relative to other countries.  He has mixed up our tax rate numerous times and vastly overstated the amount of room he has to raise corporate taxes   5) Many economists would argue that any revenue gained from a CIT rate increase would be short-term and lost over the coming years to the negative revenue effects of those rate increases, possibly in even larger amounts than had been gained in the first place!.   The NDP once claimed that more competition in telco wouldn't reduce prices (LOL!)  and then tried to block Wind Mobile from competing against the big three (not LOL).  (Here is evidence that competition did reduce prices for consumers.  People who had access to Wind were even able to save as much as 200% once the Robellus stranglehold had been broken, which the NDP tried to prevent) The NDP once claimed that our telco prices were a great deal and we should be happy with them. (Here is evidence that our telco prices are higher than the OECD average and that the NDP was using faulty data) In fact the NDP has a long history of supporting protectionist policies that hurt consumers but benefit the shareholders and workers at Bell, Rogers and Telus. Thomas Mulcair once pulled the ""Do you know who I am?"" card after being stopped by Parliament police for not obeying traffic laws.  He even threatened the job of the RCMP guard who was simply doing his job and holding him to the same standard of everyone else.   Mulcair seems to believe he is above the law.  Imagine how big his ego will be if he becomes Prime Minister.   Thomas Mulcair held talks with the CPC about joining them before he even tried to join the NDP.  The only reason he's not a CPC backbencher right now is either because of Kyoto or because his outrageous demands for a huge salary + cabinet position, depending on who's story you believe, but even his version of events admits he held talks with the CPC about joining them  (Also, he was a former Liberal in Quebec and the Liberals there are a right-wing party who, while Mulcair was there, had been lead by a former Progressive-Conservative of the Mulroney kind) Mulcair's NDP has punished MPs for voting the way their constituents wanted instead of the way party brass wanted them to. By default, all votes are whipped votes in the NDP and they have the worst track record when it comes to free voting. Mulcair's NDP was behind a ""dirty tricks"" robocall campaign that tried to smear a Liberal MP in Quebec The NDP once tried to issue fraudulent political tax credits to people who made donations to a partisan thinktank The NDP illegally used public money for partisan purposes and has refused to pay it back The NDP was ordered to repay illegal contributions after they tried to skirt the law to get around the ban on union donations by accounting for it as an advertising fee rather than a donation The NDP is promoting bad cannabis policies, ignoring what the evidence says about legalization.  They also want to continue the war on drugs against every other drug.  The NDP has bought into anti-science fearmongering over GM foods and anti-science idiocy on nuclear power An NDP MP once filed a false police report for a crime that never happened The NDP ignores staffer's accusation of harassment NDP accused of covering up harassment allegations as two more staffers come forward The NDP has defended internet censorship laws passed in our 9/11 anti-terror legislation that enables the government to take down websites if they're offensive, even when the website in question breaks no laws and the author is not being charged with a crime.  Numerous NDP MPs have called for a return of these censorship laws. (and here's another one) Thomas Mulcair has said he's ""an ardent supporter of Israel in all situations and in all circumstances"". He's declaring support for Israel in events that haven't even occurred yet!  How can we know who to support if the event hasn't even occured?  How can anyone take us seriously as an impartial voice for peace when our PM is saying shit like this? Mulcair has some very frightening views about federalism, language and Quebec separation, which includes opposing the Clarity Act and opposition to English being on road signs.  Does he not realize we have two official languages? NDP MPs Pierre Jacob, Paul Dewar Nathan Cullen, John Rafferty, Niki Ashton and Alex Atamanenko all lobbied the government to override TFW rejections on behalf of businesses in their ridings.     Today's NDP is not the NDP of Tommy Douglas, Ed Broadbent or Jack Layton.   It is an NDP of lies, deceit and betrayal."
CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,Legal420Now,5,Mon Jul 13 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"That is a fairly comprehensive list of the problems with the NDP but I disagree that they all are contrary to being left-wing. Corporate tax increases, market skepticism around telecoms, subsidized daycare, economic protectionism and supporting censorship of ""offensive"" speech are consistent with left wing politics.

Most people who make this argument are either dishonest Liberal trolls or simply do not understand the history of the NDP.   Mulcair has changed very few NDP policies from Layton. The only area where you could say be has moved to the right is on income tax. However, on other policies he has moved the party to the left. For example, he has been much more agresssive in promoting national public daycare than Layton. And, I know this is just rhetoric,  but if you listen to his debates in the House of Commons (not Question Period) he actually rails against the ""neoconservatism"" embraced by the Liberals and Tories since the 1990s. He also refers to the NDP as a ""social democratic party."" Layton never did that."

Universal services are fine when you have progressive taxes that ensure the wealthier and payting their fair share.  When you propose adding new universal services that are used disproportionately by the wealthy, and then you refuse to adjust tax rates so the wealthier pay their fair share, this is when you have a problem."

CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,LastBestWest,3,Tue Jul 14 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"That's just not true.   For example:   Trudeau is willing to legalize weed, raise taxes on the wealthy, and give assistance to families with children based on their income Mulcair is promoting the drug war and refuses to legalize, says he will not raise taxes on the wealthy, and his preferred form of child-care assistance is preferred by the wealthy and disproportionately benefits them   I'm sure there are probably a few ways that Mulcair is more progressive than Trudeau but in most ways he's not."
CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,swilts,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"So, weed is the one issue.  I really must disagree with you that a means-tested cash payment is more progressive than a universal public childcare program, leaving aside the fact that the Liberal plan, while a good welfare policy, does not improve access or reduce the costs of childcare because it does nothing to create spaces.   As Stephen Lewis pointed out at a childcare policy conference recently, the Conservative UCCB (which the Liberals have modified and adopted) is not a childcare policy. It's tax and welfare payment policy."

It's being phased out over like 8 years and most of the spaces get created in the last few. In the near and medium term it would be dozens of spots per riding. So, not so much a national daycare plan as a national daycare venture subject to future funding.   I was told by someone who would know, if you can find their white paper it's all in there."

That article was linking to the poll that showed the NDP's plan is more popular with higher income earners.  It's already a well known fact that subsidized daycare disproportionately benefits the wealthy:   Families in the top 25 per cent of annual earnings are nearly twice as likely to have a child in Quebec’s $7-a-day program, compared to families in the bottom quarter. In other words, the province is spending billions per year to make life easier for its wealthiest citizens. This makes no sense, particularly in an era of fiscal restraint.   http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/quebecs-plan-to-end-7-a-day-daycare-is-a-breakthrough-for-economic-fairness-and-common-sense/  And I think he hid the URLS because that's how hyperlinks work.

There is no denying that they didn't have the authority to use those funds as they did.  If they did, why didn't the CPC and LPC do the same thing and then refuse to repay it as well?  Do they just not realize they can get free money by spending it inappropriately and then refusing to repay it?  Or maybe they know they can't spend funds like that.    I smell an astroturf account.

I will need a source showing that Liberals agree to the details of agreements they have never seen. They favour free trade generally, and Canadian participation in negotiations including CETA and TPP, but statements on agreements pre-ratification, tend to go like this one:   “We are broadly supportive of this free trade agreement between Canada and the Republic of Korea, which will help provide a strong platform for Canadian companies to pursue opportunities more broadly in the Asian-Pacific region. We will take the time to review this agreement in detail."
CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,ParlHillAddict,3,Mon Jul 13 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't so much a new policy as an affirmation by the party of what it has been doing your years (as the article stated, since the 1990s).  I'm a strong NDP supporter and a supporter of free trade. I would be fine if all tariffs and export restriction (except for on a few strategic industries) were lifted.  I am suspicious of these so-called free trade agreements. They're not free trade deals in any real sense, but would be better described as managed or regulated trade. And too often these regulations overwhelmingly and unjustifiably favor large, multinational corporations at the expense of sovereign, democratically elected governments. Too often they restrict the policy choices of governments and even allow foreign corporations to sue governments for enacting policies that impact their profits (and, no, policies do not have to be discriminatory to one nationality of company to run afoul of trade agreements).  One can support free trade without supporting all free trade agreements. I have no problem with the NDP saying they support the principle of free trade. However, they must take a critical approach to these agreements. Refusing to condemn or support CETA and TPP until a final agreement is reached and made public is a responsible policy (which the Liberals, by supporting treaties they have not read, are not doing). However, I have seen leaked texts from some of these deals and there are many troubling things in them, particularly ISDS provisions. I would hope the NDP would not support these large deals until there is some significant reform of ISDS. Perhaps, it doesn't have to be eliminated, but there  need to be more mechanisms to reduce conflict-of-interest among arbitrators and re-balance the scales in favour of goverbments by ensuring judgments respect domestic legal principles, allow for appeals of rulings, and make it easier for party governments to issue rules of interpretation to arbitrators."

Sure the NDP were 25 years and a few thousand economics papers behind the times but better late than never.  I think this is a good thing. A consensus on the issue has emerged. One that is not only economically correct but a change in government wont predispose the trade deals that are vital to Canada's prosperity. I for one prefer a policy debate about the details rather than a clash of ideologies."
CanadaPolitics,3d2vyx,LastBestWest,6,Mon Jul 13 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"I think the NDP (at least, those with the power to set policy) has accepted the reality of NAFTA for 15+ years. Trade deals are really hard to get out of, unless one of the partner nations completely collapses or otherwise makes the agreement untenable. Sure, you'll get the hard-left socialist members at conventions bringing it up, or a NDP MP dissing NAFTA from time to time (usually as part of a larger argument), but the reality is that NAFTA is here to stay until it's updated or replaced.   It's like Conservatives (e.g., Diefenbaker) who carried on opposing the Maple Leaf flag after it was brought in; they wouldn't fully accept it, but after just a few years, only a few would have been seriously willing to push for restoring the Red Ensign."

CanadaPolitics,3d1v4t,KillerCronic,2,Mon Jul 13 03:48:42 2015 UTC,Germany supplied Saddam with chemical weapons. US supplied Saddam with general munitions.
CanadaPolitics,3d1v4t,tinlizzey12,3,Mon Jul 13 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"Indeed Germany was also complicit with the US in the war crime but lets not forget that this was a US policy -- the US was the one acting as the broker and even financier for these deals.   Classified documents show that Bush, first as vice president and then as President, intervened repeatedly over a period of almost a decade to obtain special assistance for Saddam Hussein--financial aid as well as access to high-tech equipment that was critical to Iraq's quest for nuclear and chemical arms.  http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-25/news/mn-2628_1_foreign-policy   Thats' why Saddam's regime had to be first removed from the US State Dept list of terrorist nations in order to allow the transactions to occur. In fact much of the technology and weapons he purchased included US licensed material that would have needed a separate OK from the US to be imported into Iraq.  Not only did the US provide the chemical weapons material (whether directly or by brokering the deals) the US also provided the targeting intelligence to deploy the chemical weapons, and covered-up for Saddam's atrocities afterwards (by for example blocking Iran from raising the issue at the UN  http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/iraq47.pdf  ) and by even trying to shift the blame for Saddam's gassing of the Kurds onto Iran.  http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/  http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/17/opinion/17iht-edjoost_ed3_.html  http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article1413.htm  http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB82/  http://fff.org/explore-freedom/article/reagans-wmd-connection-saddam-hussein/  The cooperation continued even after the war, with shipments of anthrax and other bio-chemical agents, to known weapons fronts in Iraq. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1359802/Iraqs-chemists-bought-anthrax-from-America.html  Furthermore, after the Second Gulf War, when Iraq filed its Final and Complete Declaration of its WMDs consisting of 12000 pages, the US accused him of lying about no longer having WMDs (which turned out to be true) but the US also secretly removed 8000 pages from the declaration that implicated US and Western companies in his WMD program.

Keep your friends close and your enemies closer is good statecraft, and with no embassy, we are keeping Iran at a distance.  Normalising relations is also advisable as it is also part of keeping Iran close. It also means that we have a mechanism for changing their policy. It is a very long lever with a massive weight on the short end and a small one on the long end, so the impact is not great, but with relations broken off, we don't even have that.  Depends on what level of trust you're talking about. We have limits to how much we trust any country, including NATO allies, the five eyes and the US, so there is no other nation that we fully trust. Trust is also something that you have to build up. At present, we can't trust them that much, but that can change over time, if we have and maintain diplomatic relations. We are unlikely to gain the level of trust one has with allied nations, (at least so long as they remain a dictatorial theocracy) but I could see us trusting each other as much as trading nations do, given time."

CanadaPolitics,3d1v4t,trollunit,4,Mon Jul 13 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"The reason that Kennedy cut off diplomatic ties with Cuba in 1962 was because Cuba was the only country ever to be a strategic threat to the country. I mean, the Soviets literally had 30 to 35 medium range ICBMs with 1mt warheads--Little Boy was 16kt, so these warheads were over 50 times more powerful--pointed at the United States mainland, and six additions 12kt nuclear weapons that could be carried on one of 42 unassembled Il-28 bombers on standby.  The missiles had a range of 1200nm and the Ilyushin bombers could fly 600nm. The missiles and planes were in the range of Florida; the missiles could also hit the Gulf coast and much of the eastern seaboard up to the Mid-Atlantic. Cities such as Miami, New Orleans, Jacksonville, Atlanta and even Washington DC. At the peak of the crisis, these cities could have been hit by as much as 36mt of Soviet nuclear arsenal; 12kt wiped out Hiroshima, so the result would have been beyond catastrophic.  Justified or not, the US percieved Cuba as a threat for over 50 years. But the point is, that's why diplomatic ties were cut, because of the threat.   Although Iran is not a direct threat to Canada, it is a direct threat to Canada's allies and interests in the Middle East, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, through the Revolutionary Guard and their funding/support of Hizbullah, Hamas, Houthi rebels in Yemen, the Assad regime and the Islamic State. Iran has been responsible for more deaths of Westerners in the Middle East, North Africa and central Asia, than the US or even Pakistan.  The Iranian regime is suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapon, and their violent, apocalyptic rhetoric against both Israel and Jews triggers worries that they just might use it.   In addition, the motorcycle-riding Basij and Revolutionary Guard suppress their own people if they dare rise up against the brutal theocracy that rules their watan. I mean, the country has literally cut itself off from the internet as a result of the 2009 Green Revolution.   The president and Iranian parliament do not have the power: those that have the power are the Ayatollahs, the clerics (Guardian Council and Assembly of Experts) and the Revolutionary Guard. And they are fanatic, with an extreme anti-west, anti-moderate Islam mindset, for the same reasons that the WBC does what it does; they feel God requires it.  The Canadian Forces answer to the British Monarch in her role as Queen of Canada through the Governor-General of Canada, who in turn answer to the civilian leadership in the Cabinet--including the prime minister and minister of national defence--and are tasked with defending the country. The U.S. armed forces answer directly to the President and Congress, and are sworn to upholding the U.S. Constitution and defend the country from enemies both foreign and domestic. In this way, the military serves the people and the nation first and foremost in both countries. The Revolutionary Guard has no such mandate. They serve the Revolution, the Ayatollahs and the clerics. Much like the SA (and later SS) did not serve the German people, but served the NSDAP, and specifically Hitler.  I cannot see any reason or justification as to why Canada and Iran should restore diplomatic ties until the Supreme Leader agrees to stop threatening Canadian interests in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia is just as bad (maybe even worse than Iran) in some areas, but foreign policy is not controlled by the clerics, only the royal family, who are willing to open up with the west. And at least they supply the west with oil and play along with the west's geopolitical interests. Iran was threatening to mine the Strait of Hormuz at one point and cripple oil supplies."

Khomeini said safheh-i ruzgar (صفحه روزگا), or a metaphorical ""map of time"", i.e., Ahmedinejad was talking about Khomeini's desire for the collapse of the State of Israel, for the Israeli ""occupation"" of Jerusalem to end.  In 2002, Barack Obama made a anti-war speech, as Bush and Blair were beating the drums for war in Iraq. In the speech, he said that Saddam Hussein was no threat to the US, and like all petty dictators, he would fall away into the dustbin of history.   Ahmedinejad was inelegantly trying to convey similar logic, that Khomeini desired for the State of Israel, which he believed was unjustly occupying Jerusalem, to fall away into the dustbin of history--and it was badly translated as wanting to destroy Israel by force.  In before I get called an anti-Zionist."

To this day, blood is still being shed in east of Ukraine as part of the fallout from that coup, as the government we are supporting and giving military training is pressing attacks against rebel positions there.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LQFKmVQKho (today's report of battle activity).

Letting a few protesters camp inside the embassy for a few days (including one with a Canadian passport, who had the right to seek temporary refuge) does not equal ""overtly aiding"" a coup. But when you have protesters (ranging from peaceful to extremely violent) on one side, and aggressive military/security forces on the other, all raging around you, it's understandable for an embassy to make decisions on the fly that don't look good in hindsight. Maybe they made a decision that attempting to forcibly evict them (once they were already inside the grounds) was a worse idea than letting them stay until they could be convinced to leave on their own.   This isn't being covered in the corporate media because some people might put 2+2 together and realize that the same army we are training is also engaged in a hot war, making us again overtly complicit in those actions.    Reports from the rebel forces are just as unreliable as those of Ukrainian forces themselves (the idea that Ukrainians suffered substantial casualties while rebels had only a few ""warriors"" injured is incredibly hard to believe). There's war propaganda from both sides, and YouTube channels run by the rebels (or the nation that supports them) aren't exactly an unbiased source.   Canadians are well aware, even from the ""corporate media"" (tip: few actual Canadians use that term; though, it's very popular in Russian press...), that Ukrainian forces are still engaged with rebels despite the various ceasefires and agreements. Canada is open about its role supporting the current Ukrainian government. Meanwhile, there's a certain other major power that has been aiding the rebel forces since day 1, but continues to deny it completely. Funny how that works..."

The Putin government is antithetical to what anyone on the left should support and is going as far as funding Far-Right parties in Europe such as the french front national.

Who knows.   the idea that Ukrainians suffered substantial casualties while rebels had only a few ""warriors"" injured is incredibly hard to believe).   Why is that? First off, the rebels are currently in a purely defensive position in this war. It's far easier to sustain fewer casualties from this position. Secondly, the incompetence of the Ukrainian military has been well established to date. They are a conscript army with poor morale and have suffered far more loses than the rebels have since the start of this conflict.   That being said, of course I'm not viewing these as gospel truth. But there ARE no reports from the other side or the western media. This war barely exists to them, particular in the current state where the rebels are just defending. Pretty hard to whip up anti-Russian hysteria over the fact the rebels aren't letting their people be genocided out of Ukraine by neo-Nazi militias..."

CanadaPolitics,3d2vhe,Juggernaut_N,7,Mon Jul 13 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you consider to be a religious influence. At some level, religion provides a foundation for many peoples' values and these values inform decisions like voting. Even if someone is not religious like myself, I can't help but be somewhat influenced by my Catholic schooling and the occasional visit to a Lutheran or a Catholic church when I was younger. Even if I disagree with many aspects of catholic doctrine, I believe it has contributed in some ways to my outlook and values just like many other aspects of my life have shaped who I am. Does that mean religion has an influence on government when I vote? Possibly, but I can also provide secular rationale for my values as well."

CanadaPolitics,3d2vhe,revchj,2,Mon Jul 13 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"I can't prove anything, but I'm convinced that the social conservatism of the CPC is grounded largely in Evangelical Christianity, which in Canada is strongest in the West and especially in Alberta.  Evangelicalism is not identical in Canada to its larger cousin in the U.S. (which is almost entirely identified with the Republican party), but there are major links between the groups, with Canadian Evangelical pastors often coming from, or educated in, American seminaries.  This suspicion of mine was heightened around the time of the Bev Oda affair, when I heard a rumour that when KAIROS was defunded, international aid money started flowing instead through Evangelical-controlled agencies. Incidentally, I'd love it if someone here could either substantiate or debunk that: it has bugged me for years.  The influence on the left is harder to trace because it exists mostly in mainline Christianity, which is less homogenous.  As an Anglican, I can tell you that Premier Christy Clark and Green leader Elizabeth May are both Anglicans... and neither one really cares what our senior Canadian bishop thinks, much less the Archbishop of Canterbury.  The heyday of the Protestant Left was in the Social Gospel movement of the early-mid-20th century, epitomized by Tommy Douglas.  Its spirit is much diminished now, but lives on in groups like KAIROS and especially in the United Church (which, back in small towns in the 60s, was often jokingly called ""the town council at prayer"").  Catholics have a strong tradition of social conservatism and economic leftism, but only a minority of rank-and-file Catholics are actually influenced by their church's social teaching. Apart from the United Church (and perhaps the statistically insignificant Quakers), I know of no other Christian denomination whose leadership is strongly and universally leftist.  With immigration shifting to historically non-Christian countries over the past few decades, the religion of immigrants might now be having some impact on the immigrant-vote strategies of the political parties.  Even so, Christianity remains the dominant religion in Canada by far, with other religions claiming only a tiny slice of the pie, so I don't think Sikhism, Islam, Hinduism etc. are major concerns for party strategists yet. Many immigrants are Christian, usually of a socially conservative variety of Evangelicalism or Catholicism, so they usually get covered when courting the Evangelical or Catholic vote."

The provincial level is a different story. Access to abortion services in the east coast are pretty horrific, and that's almost entirely due to the influence of religion in the area. The Wildrose in AB scared the crap out of me with their rhetoric, but seemed to have tamed or at least quieted some of the more right wing members of the party in the latest election."

CanadaPolitics,3d2nl6,suchapain,3,Mon Jul 13 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"Because it was put to referendum. The accord was a complex compromise, in which no one got exactly what they wanted. So there were dozens of reasons to vote against it (because people didn't think it gave their interest group enough), and only one reason to vote for it -- which is that it was a reasonable compromise.  Also, a huge factor was that people by that point genuinely detested Brian Mulroney, wanted him to fail, and didn't want him to have an important legacy."
CanadaPolitics,3d2nl6,_eleemosynary,4,Mon Jul 13 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"I think Wikipedia has a good explanation   As the campaign progressed, the accord steadily became less and less popular. This is often credited to much of the electorate finding at least some aspect of the lengthy accord with which they disagreed and the extreme unpopularity of Brian Mulroney in 1992. Canada was experiencing a deepening recession since the Meech Lake Accord process ended on June 23, 1990, and many saw a political elite obsessed with constitutional affairs to the detriment of the health of the economy.  Mulroney was already deeply unpopular with Canadian voters, and was generally seen to have made a number of mistakes in the referendum campaign. Most famously, he referred to persons against the Accord as ""enemies of Canada"", and while speaking about the dangers of voting against the agreement in Sherbrooke, he ripped a piece of paper in half with a dramatic flourish to represent the historic gains for Quebec that would be threatened if the accord failed. Many voters, in fact, misinterpreted the action as a reference to the potential breakup of the country, with overtones of belligerence and intimidation.  The Accord was especially unpopular in Western provinces, where prominent figures argued that the Accord was essentially a document created by the nation's elites to codify their vision of what Canada ""should"" be. B.C. broadcaster Rafe Mair gained national prominence by arguing that the accord represented an attempt to permanently cement Canada's power base in the Quebec-Ontario bloc at the expense of fast-growing, wealthy provinces like Alberta and British Columbia that were challenging its authority. To proponents of such beliefs, opposing the accord became portrayed as a campaign of grassroots activism against the interests of the powerful.  In Quebec, a tape featuring two bureaucrats saying that Bourassa had ""caved"" in negotiations was played on a radio station. Further undermining the ""Yes"" vote in Quebec was when British Columbia's Constitutional Affairs minister Moe Sihota, responding to Mair's comments, said that Bourassa had been ""outgunned"" in the discussions. Despite a consensus victory by Bourassa in a television debate against Parizeau, the ""Oui"" campaign stalled at 45% in the polls."

CanadaPolitics,3d0t60,alessandro-,13,Sun Jul 12 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"Mr. Fast insists, though, that he is not beholden to any particular sector in deciding whether to sign a Trans-Pacific deal.  “At the end of the day my role is to promote the national interest, writ large. I think Canadians understand that.”   Unfortunately it would appear that the CPC don't include engaging Canadians or legislators in their definition of ""national interest.""    A recent article  in the Globe and Mail (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ibbitson-whats-mulcairs-position-on-free-trade/article25349233/?service=mobile) describes the NDP's ongoing lament over the secrecy surrounding TPP negotiations as well as their position on trade deals like CETA (with Europe) and the TPP:   In principle, the party supports free trade with Europe, a continent with stringent labour and environmental safeguards and a robust social-democratic tradition.  But New Democrats are unhappy with, among other things, a provision that allows corporations to sue governments that violate the agreement, known as investor-state dispute resolution (ISDS).   “I can’t think of a more foolish position [to take] on an important matter like a trade agreement than to pronounce on an agreement before it is completed,” Mr. Davies maintained. In any event, he considered it highly unlikely the NDP would be ready to take a position on the TPP until after the election, because the party would first want to engage in broad consultation.   I say ""ongoing lament"" because the NDP and the Greens highlighted similar concerns roughly one year ago when they signed a statement with concerned legislators and other interested parties in other affected countries calling for a draft to be made public ""... before any final agreement is signed with sufficient time to enable effective legislative scrutiny and public debate."" Here's a link, for those who are interested:  http://canadians.org/tpp.   Clearly, nothing's changed on this front as far as this Government's attitude and approach are concerned.   That's inexcusable and very un-democratic, in my view.   In this next article, Mr. Davies highlights additional concerns with respect to the TTP in the area of the very poor human rights track records of a number of participating countries (http://www.cbc.ca/m/news/politics/trans-pacific-partnership-never-heard-of-it-canadians-tell-pollster-1.3116770).    ""It (TPP) involves countries who are not democratic, that don't allow free elections, that suppress dissidents, that ethnically target minorities, they have child labour, forced labour. In fact, Brunei, one of the countries, recently passed Sharia law, which makes homosexual acts and adultery punishable by stoning to death.""  Davies said this is unacceptable. ""These are not Canadian values, these do not conform to minimum international standards,"" he said. ""I expect the Canadian government to be speaking publicly and strongly about these because we think trade policy should be used to raise these kinds of standards and it should be a condition of participation.""   Contrast the above with what the Prime Minister had to say in the House of Commons recently about the small minority of women who would choose to wear Niqabs at Citizenship Ceremonies (and the CPC's 11th hour introduction of legislation designed to prohibit them from doing so) and the question that pops into my mind is, why would Canada be so duplicitous as to take such a principled stand on this issue while at the same time turning a blind eye to human rights violations in countries by entering into financial relationships with them.   http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com//news/niqab-court-ruling-appeal  In fact, there is a whole host of human rights and environmental concerns with the TPP as this next link and the excerpts copied in below reveal:  http://canadians.org/media/top-un-human-rights-experts-say-tpp-concern-human-rights-assessments-must-precede-negotiations   The human rights experts criticized the extreme secrecy surrounding the talks. They also had harsh words for  ISDS ( Investor-State Dispute Settlement) provisions that allow foreign corporations to sue countries over laws and policies which curtail their profit on investments. The rapporteurs said that this would have a chilling effect on countries’ ability to enact laws to protect environmental and social standards.   Finally, this next link goes to a very well reasoned piece in the Huffington Post by Bernie Sanders (long time U.S. senator who's seeking the Democratic nomination for President). I refer to this piece a lot in TPP-related reddit comments because it's so very easy to read and compelling in terms of the arguments he makes as to why the TPP is tantamount to ""a race to the bottom"" for the middle class, democracy and affordable healthcare. Among other things, Mr. Sanders lists concrete examples of multinational corporations using ISDS provisions from existing trade deals to interfere with Government policies geared toward bringing about social and environmental improvements in their respective countries. The analysis is relatively short; I highly recommend reading it.   http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/7352166  At the end of the day, I'm not particularly interested in hearing a play-by-play on the partisan games of chicken and blame and shame that political leaders are playing out in public arena to position themselves for upcoming negotiations. Rather, given the foregoing, I'd be a great deal more interested in hearing from our Government on how, precisely, this deal is ""in Canada's national interest"".  Moreover, while clearly not everything the Government plans to do can be brought to Canadians for a vote, in a liberal democracy like Canada one would expect that Canadians would be informed if they seek to be. As matter of course, the legislators we all elect to office should have been included in this ages ago; if they aren't, they can't possibly do their job ... which is to represent us, after all.   That the shroud of secrecy surrounding these negotiations persists means that voters will be going to the polls without benefit of knowing, in official terms, what the full draft agreement contains. This, in turn, means that robust discussion around the pros and cons of the positions of various parties on the agreement will be, at best, only partially informed.  This isn't how sound liberal democracies function. In a sound liberal democracy, the party that's elected to power works for (and reports to) the electorate ... Not a handful of multinational corporations."

There are industries Canada has to protect in order to stay sovereign. How long can we survive a trade embargo from China if we import most of our food from them because it's cheaper.  Whatever course you want to take to protect Canadian agriculture, doesn't matter to me. As long as it is effective and results in high quality, safe food for everyone.  Believe me. Food is not something you want to have ""competition"" on. Everyone has gone crazy with the capitalist bug and they think everything is up for auction.  It's not. Food, security, government.

It's a topic about which the majority of people participating in this subreddit will have an informed opinion, and about which those who don't can easily educate themselves on in order to form their own informed opinion.   But to put it in short form, the primary effect of artificial restrictions on the amount of dairy and poultry products which can be produced is to dramatically increase the price paid for those products by Canadian consumers, to the benefit of a small cartel of producers.   This is a bad thing."

Listen, you can believe in supply management all you want. My point is, don't expect others to do the same and pretend like your view is right, especially when you refuse to discuss it.  Here are some facts for you. The average chicken farm in the USA is 2 million chickens. With supply management in Canada, the average chicken farm is 12,000-24,000 chickens. Supply management enables family farms to operate and creates jobs in communities across the nation. Half of all chicken meat in the USA comes from just 10 farms.  When you buy an egg in Canada, you know you are supporting a Canadian farmer. You know those chickens were treated well because of the strict rules and regulations we have in Canada.   Supply management guarantees things. Food security. Food quality. The ability for small farms to turn a profit. The list can go on and on. But I won't bother, since you won't even offer up one bit of evidence to support your notion that flooding the Canadian market with cheap quality goods is good for Canadians."

CanadaPolitics,3d0t60,KillerCronic,5,Sun Jul 12 20:38:00 2015 UTC,"My rebuttle of the arguments inside the article. Something you were unable to do for the facts I provided.  Starting with Macleans:  The article essentially explains that supply-management is just another form of subsidy for the dairy and poultry industries. The author brings up the fact that the Euro Zone and the United States still maintain subsidies for their farmers in these areas. I agree that this is a problem, and the EU has said they are willing to eliminate subsidies is the United States and their other major trade partners do so as well. I think the flaw in using this as an argument is that subsidizing the industry does not harm our position in international trade talks.   The author further argues:   he reality is this: supply management is not perfect, but it is more perfect in the Canadian context than any other system of dairy market organization.  Canadian dairy farming is one of the few agricultural sectors that is self-sufficient—providing income security for farmers and requiring no government subsidy   And if you don't look at the fact that supply management costs the average family an additional $300/year, you might find that line of thought convincing. Government is funded by taxpayers, and so is the dairy industry. Effectively, through maintaining supply management, the government is taxing consumers and harming its trade position, as well as the position of 94% of Canadian farmers who find it harder to export due to our maintenance of supply management.   We need only look to Australia to see the risk of eliminating any controls on our dairy regime. As I have previously published and studied, as of 2000, Australia opted for a completely subsidy-free regime, with disastrous results.   He provided no evidence to why Australia's system has been disastrous. Almost all the evidence points to the contrary, especially in light of the Dairy export boom. NZ and AUS are major exporters of dairy products to Asia (where demand for milk products continues to grow), have relatively low prices and strong farms. Abolishing supply management could be a major boon for Canada's dairy industry if we dismantle it slowly and with government support.  The second article is the opinion of the HoC, which has chronically been weak to stand up to the Dairy Lobby. Furthermore, it only suggests what the opinions of the house is. I'm going to be honest and say that I didn't have time to read much of it.  Montreal gazette: Written by the same author as the Macleans article (Bruce Muirhead, who happens to hold the Egg Farmers of Canada Chair in Public Policy - this is to say he is also a lobbiest for the supply management system) In this article, he once again makes the same platitudes to support his opinion:   Canada’s system of supply management makes so much sense for both consumers and farmers. It is cost effective, while enforcing a consistent set of rules to provide consumers peace of mind and promote the highest standards for food safety and farming practices.   Its hilarious for him to assert that supply management is good for farmers and consumers. Canadians pay up to 3 times more for milk and dairy products. Furthermore, it can hardly be good for all farmers. When supply management was implemented in 1970's, there were 145,000 farms in poultry and dairy. Now, there aren't even 13000.  Huffington post: Once again, same author, same platitidues.  One thing I've noticed is that he continues to suggest that supply management protects the quality of dairy products. This is a flat out lie. Its Canada's regulations surrounding dairy and poultry industries that maintain the quality. Foreign competitors would be subject to the same regulations, meaning that the quality on the market would not suffer.  I'm sorry, but I'm not convinces by any of these resources. Given all of the evidence to the contrary, I find it difficult to take 3 articles written by the same lobbiest very seriously.  Below is one of the most detailed published reports on supply management and its harms in Canada. I would highly recommend taking the time to read it.  http://www.policyschool.ucalgary.ca/sites/default/files/research/m-hall-findlay-supply-mgnt-final.pdf"

What's the logic in treating eggs and milk like that, when we don't do so with shoes, hand tools, cars, ipods, etc?  Helping ensure that the dairy industry doesn't need to capitalize on economies of scale is not a public good. Efficiency is better. I don't see how ""the family farm"" is supposed to be better than any other kind.

Why would we be paying for it anyways? If other countries want to subsidize the food that we consume, I say we let them.

""The entire Canadian agricultural economy?"" Hardly. Other areas of the agricultural industry manage quite well without limiting their production and forcing Canadians to overpay for their products. Eggs, milk and poultry is not in any way shape or form the entire Canadian agricultural industry.   Once again, you seem to be making some pretty rash broad sweeping statements that fall apart when a comparison is made to other similar industries.   I see no reason to prop up the profits of the producers who currently benefit from the supply management system any longer. The industry will adapt accordingly, and the rest of the country will benefit as a result from both cheaper Canadian products and increased access to imports from abroad."

Actually its the opposite, an example is we have more dairy farmers as our herds are smaller.  Canada its around 78 where New Zealand its around 450.  Also New Zealand the dairy farmers are slaves to Fonterra as they have a monopsony, so similar to a quota system since there's one buyer.  Besides, if you want to export dairy you have to go through the WTO which uses a quota system for dairy exports.  I always here complaints about the price, dairy imports from the US and EU have been subsidized to be lower in price so its not a direct comparison.     Comparable figures in other countries to this $1.26 are 20c in the UK (where it is currently abnormally low because of a price war), 55c in Australia, 60c in the USA and 75c in Canada.   https://keithwoodford.wordpress.com/2014/04/02/why-is-new-zealands-retail-milk-so-expensive/  Everything costs more in Canada, an example is fuel used for transportation which is needed for any dairy producer to get the milk to the processing plant and then to market, that adds to the cost consumers pay not a dairy farmers pocket.  Its the same for say a pair of Nike shoes, its cheaper in the US then Canada just bc doing business here has more taxes.  Full disclosure that my family farms and we used to have a dairy operation so I'm quite familiar with the system and the benefits and downfalls, I also don't have no horse in the race if its eliminated or if its kept.  But I can tell you that the system is much better support and entry system for farmers then in the US.  The ""rich dairy farmers"" comments are entertaining though to read, my guess is they've never actually met a dairy farmer."

In other words, Canadian Muslims need to receive a state-sponsored stamp of approval before participating in dialogue with our government.   I find that suggestion distasteful. Considering the last time that kind of thinking prevailed, where former Conservative (and Liberal) MP Wajid Khan (Mississauga-Streetsville) reported a political and social rival to police (Qayyum Jamal), his only ""crime"" apparently being speaking out against the war in Afghanistan, and turned him into the ring leader of the Toronto 18. He was ultimately released due to lack of evidence but was held in jail for 2 years without bail. So there, we have a Muslim MP lying (or at least distorting the truth) to have someone jailed.

Immigrants to Canada integrate so well because when they arrive in Canada, they find that race isn't all that important to most people, and that urban centres are well mixed and diversified, eliminating the need to ""blend in"". Muslim immigrants have much been dealt with the same way: they come to Canada, they're Muslim, and that's ok.  Starting crap like this gives Canadian Muslims things to be mad about. The government segregating them as a class of their own makes the Muslim community into an ""othered"" group, which creates feelings of alienation and discontent. Over time, it can grow into anger that they're being treated differently, and at that point, you have a problem.  Canada can do better than what we're doing now when it comes to Islam in Canada.

Sectarian violence of this sort has been plaguing the world since long before 9/11. (Which I assume is the starting point you're referencing with ""15 years."") The root cause is the things those with power do to disenfranchise, disrespect, dehumanize, and destabilize those without power.    Stop denying it and pretending they don't exist.   They exist alright, but the causes of this behaviour are far more complicated than simply, ""they're radical muslims."" It isn't specifically about radicalization, but to anyone who's remotely concerned about the presence of Muslims and Islamic culture in Western countries, I'd recommend Doug Saunders' The Myth of the Muslim Tide."

You are simplifying thing a bit here. That is a part but not the whole. Wealthy countries with high wages usually make up for it with increased productivity. An hour of work might cost more in Germany than Vietnam but that German worker produces more. Labour costs are related to but not the same as wages. Germany has been very successful despite high wages and an expensive currency because they have invested heavily in productivity.   Since most research of late points to an explosion in CEO salaries that has in no way been tied to CEO productivity, perhaps we should be looking for efficiencies in the upper echelons,   Executives get paid a lot but there very few of them. The contribution of the CEO's pay to the marginal cost of a product is tiny. The CEO of GM could get paid $1 a day and a car would still cost basically the same to make as it does now."

Unless Ontario wants to drastically cut costs for auto manufacturers to incentivize them, I don't see how we're going to compete and I think the simply answer is: we shouldn't.   Ontario should look to expand Second Career to people currently employed in the automotive industry and enable them to take diplomas/degrees at public and private colleges and universities before there is a lay-off, by that rather than waiting for them to be laid-off and wait the 13 weeks (minimum) start the program early and enable them to walk away rather than be laid-off.   Second, the government should work with industry experts and analysts to target growth opportunities and provide key support to ensure that those industries remain competitive and viable long-term. If that means targeted tax cuts or government promotion of goods and services abroad, then do that.   I would also suggest that focusing on auto manufacturing rather than develop our strengths is a bit like shooting ourselves in the foot the night before a marathon. Why would we want to try and compete with the likes of Mexico when we're not in that category?"

It's not about cutting costs or a race to the bottom, it's about stopping the self-inflicted wounds that are making the province a more difficult place to do business. We can't do much about the price of electricity any longer, but a lot of the big self-inflicted wounds are still to come (carbon pricing, ORPP, Trudeau's 53.25% marginal tax rate plus whatever tax increases Wynne has in store, etc.), and we still have a chance to put the brakes on some of those.  I honestly don't understand the ""we shouldn't even try to compete"" attitude. For people who believe this, where do you expect to be able to find work once so many businesses leave? Do you work in government or tech? Because those are about the only two industries in this province where you're somewhat insulated from the carnage that the private sector is going through right now. (And honestly, I suspect most of the young Liberal supporters who are in tech are going to bail on the province and head to the US once most of the economic opportunity here is gone and tax and energy rates continue to rise.) For the rest of us, and particularly those of us who are middle aged, it's a terrifying time to be in the private sector in Ontario. I know my employer is in trouble because of rising costs, we've been through three rounds of layoffs, and the ORPP is probably going to be the catalyst for another couple rounds. I've been looking to jump ship to something else for almost 20 months now and there's nothing.

I work in the private sector.   The automotive industry is a tight market, one hallmarked by strict competition at all levels and at all types. It means that their margins are thin, often compounded by legacy costs and subject to shifts in the market place. A move to Mexico realizes a significant saving for manufacturers who are increasingly offering better incentivisation to consumers, further reducing their profitability margin. The Mexican government is offering zero taxation, access to prime real estate and development projects that directly benefit manufacturers. From the Maquiladora districts in northern Mexico to FTZs dotted around the country, they can reduce overall costs, provide significant savings while increasing productivity versus operations in Canada.   The government formulates these ersatz schemes to retain automotive manufacturing, but the decline continues. And it will continue. With free trade, global trade and communications, there's no need. Just-in-Time manufacturing means that manufacturing can be customized to needs in real time, not once they've built-up an inventory of unwanted cars. They can get equipment from Mexico to Canada very quickly, whether on trucks, or trains or ships. Ontario can appointment an industry leader, can pray to the deities, or they can accept reality.   Ontario needs to appoint an ""Industry Czar"" a person wholly independent of the government commissioned to look at strengths and weaknesses, create non-partisan plans and help the government prepare strategy. I've already suggested a few things:   Extend Second Career to include people not currently laid-off while increasing the maximum funding from $28,000 to $34,000 and enable them to take two year programs; Extend the mandate of industry groups in the province to help attract business; Provide direct and indirect subsidies to industries establishing in Ontario;  Lower the corporate tax rate to 10%;  Provide Toronto with a special economic designation that provides increased cooperation on projects with economic impact and ensure that the Greater Toronto Area has increased communication with the Government of Ontario;  Establish a Minister responsible for Urban economies.   These are just a few basic ideas. The issue is that we're over a barrel with manufacturing and we're not going to win. We need to be economically competitive, and we need the ability to attract new companies but not when we know that we simply don't have the foundation. We have to ensure that people in roles like auto manufacturing have an exit plan and facilitate the government moving towards a better market orientation that seeks to broaden our economic activity, not link it to an outmoded industry.   I just want to add(Edit):   For the rest of us, and particularly those of us who are middle aged, it's a terrifying time to be in the private sector in Ontario. I know my employer is in trouble because of rising costs, we've been through three rounds of layoffs, and the ORPP is probably going to be the catalyst for another couple rounds.   I agree wholeheartedly, but a big source of the problem is that the government is focusing on one industry and not looking at the economy from a macro perspective. What are we doing right? What can we do better? How can we attract more business? This is about accepting that auto manufacturing is one area that we're disadvantaged in and rather than do what we're doing, we should look to build other areas of the economy. The government has taken several steps to help retain manufacturing, but it keeps walking out the front door. If after everything we don't succeed, then don't try again: Help retrain people and move them into new jobs. Build other areas of the economy."

CanadaPolitics,3d195y,Frisian89,8,Sun Jul 12 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that argument before and that doesn't seem to be the case.

CanadaPolitics,3d195y,Oliphantt,10,Sun Jul 12 19:58:04 2015 UTC,"This depends on the type of water in the system. In soft water, fluoridation lowers the water pH which then can corrode piping. They have to add pH adjusting chemicals which increases costs"

CanadaPolitics,3d195y,adaminc,3,Sun Jul 12 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"No you were right the first time.  Na+ + F- + H2O  <->  Na+ + HF +OH-  Equilibrium obviously on the far left*, but you can see this reaction produces hydroxide, which causes the pH to rise (the salt is a weak base). However it is added at very low concentration and this is a pretty weak base so I am not sure how much an effect would there be, nor do I want to calculate anything right now  *Actually, HF is a weak acid, and therefore F- is a strong base, and so equilibrium is on the right."

CanadaPolitics,3d195y,Frisian89,3,Sun Jul 12 23:08:42 2015 UTC,"Interesting TIL, thank you. This sets up a reasonable argument against fluoridation in communities with soft water.

It’s in all waters,” he explains. “What we’re doing is optimizing the level to a level where it can prevent caries [tooth decay]….we don’t think it’s any different from fortifying salt with iodine or cereals with folate to prevent other diseases.”  Ito is not alone. More than 90 major organizations support adding fluoride to water to reduce the incidence of cavities, including Health Canada, the Canadian Dental Association, the Canadian Medical Association and the Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry.   This is a resounding consensus. I'm so disappointed that my city, Calgary, has joined others in reversing one of the greatest achievements in health in the 20th century.

Open lists aren't ordered.  Parties nominate candidates just like now, but unlike now you have a choice.   You also seem to be ignoring my point about independant candidates, given that those are of course impossible to get elected under such a system   No, I'm not. I specifically mentioned them.  Independents have an easier time getting elected, or re-elected.  Since the point was missed, I'll go more in depth below.  There are a few different ways to go about it.  The one I prefer is to just give independents the same access to the ballot as anyone else. Take this ballot from Tasmania for example. They use STV, but you could use the same form of ballot for any open list system.  So if I want to vote for independent Ian Hill, I just put an X next to Ian Hill's name. If he gets enough votes, he gets elected.  In a 5 seat district (which this ballot is for), that would be ~12% of the vote or so.  The late Margo MacDonald of Scotland is a recent example of that (she was elected in 2011 but passed away since then).  That's a closed list system, but it works the same way.  Another way you can go about it is to form an ""independents' list."" Open lists are really just an agreement to transfer surplus votes between a set of candidates.  In Germany, independent politicians band together as a ""free voters association.""  Where free voters (Freie Wähler) have had the most success at the state level is in the open-list state of Bavaria.  In the most recent Bavarian state election free voters managed to take 19 out of 180 seats.  19 independents is a heck of a lot more than have ever been elected under IRV in Australia or FPTP in Canada.  It's comparable to the 16 out of 166 independents elected in Ireland under STV in their most recent election though.   and the point about IRV not likely requiring a constitutional amendment, whereas implementination of a nation-wide PR system most certainly would.   Who says a PR system has to be nation-wide? Scotland's isn't.  Ireland's isn't. Australia's isn't.  No one is pushing for a nation-wide system here.  We're just talking about multi-member districts, and those have ample precedent in Canadian politics.  Talk of a nation-wide system is just a strawman put forward by PR opponents.  IRV would also rather unfairly disadvantage the Conservative Party.  I'm not a Conservative, but I don't agree with using electoral reform as a stick to punish one party or another."
CanadaPolitics,3d0t8q,CupOfCanada,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"One more point. Australia uses IRV for its House and look at how close to a two party system they are (yes, the coalition has multiple parties but the odds of them acting with anyone but the Liberals are like the odds of an independent Tea Party siding with the Democrats).

Sure, it's pretty good for single winner elections (I don't know what you mean by the term 'nonpartisan elections').  But our federal and provincial elections are not single winner elections, they are multi-winner.  I'm always disappointed when I see people suggest that we use IRV for federal elections, because in most respects it's just as bad as FPTP. It's not even remotely close to being proportional, so we'll get the same skewed results we always have. Results might be ""more fair"" in individual ridings, but the end result nation-wide will be just as skewed."

Example using 2011 Results with 2015 seats  Total Seats = 338  Conservatives 39.62% = 133.91 Seats  NDP 30.63% = 103.69 Seats  Liberals 18.91% = 63.91 Seats  Bloc 6.04% = 20.41 Seats  Green 3.91% = 13.2 Seats  Party with the highest amount of votes will get rounded up until the number of seats is reached(if above 5)  Conservative = 134(+1)  NDP = 104(+1)  Liberals = 64(+1)  Bloc = 20  Green = 13  3*  Note Forces et Democratie has 2 seats currently in the case of a seat short they should be handed out via popular vote so example, if they are 4 seats short the Conservatives, NDP, Liberals, and Bloc will recive an extra seat. This could happean if a party dosen't meet the threshold % of the vote, in my opion it should be 2%-4%"
CanadaPolitics,3d0s8q,scouter0,27,Sun Jul 12 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"This reads to me as a lament from a ""radical"" that the NDP is no longer as ""radical"" as it once was.  I put ""radical"" in quotation marks because the author, Rick Salutin, is born and raised in Canada and we have never had the kind of radical politics that a comparison with Syriza or Podemos would warrant.  Canada has NEVER had the kind of political radicalism that results from civil war and authoritarian governments (something both Greece and Spain are still recovering from).  The NDP has certainly came more to the right with Layton's later tenure and Mulcair's current one; however, I think it is a mistake, and well worn NDP rhetoric, to claim that adoption of similar economic perspectives makes the Liberals and the NDP essentially the same.  This feels very much like an update to ""Liberal and Tory, same old story"". If that really were the case, we would only have one party in this country and not two, three, four, or more.  I'm not saying the Liberals and the NDP shouldn't merge, but to claim that they are essentially the same already is nonsense. The CPC wasn't founded upon the merger of two long standing right wing parties that woke up one day after many decades of differences. The Reform/Alliance started out as a splinter group from the PCs and was just over twenty years old when the merger happened. The 'unite the right' movement really was a 'reunite the right'. The NDP, and the CCF before them, have never been a part of the Liberals and vice versa."

CanadaPolitics,3d0s8q,ProbablyStalin,16,Sun Jul 12 16:26:20 2015 UTC,"the Liberals are more “democratic” on electoral reform (a ranked ballot)   Last time I checked, we support a MMP system to replace FPTP (http://www.ndp.ca/news/ndp-wants-to-implement-mixed-proportional-system). I'm unaware if the Liberals have cast their support behind any concrete replacement of FPTP, or just an abandoning of FPTP in general.   NDP economic policies are no more interventionist than Liberals’; they would, for instance, “improve rail travel” and “develop proposals” for high speed trains. So would Justin Trudeau and your Uncle Harry.   I mean, we'd also start spending billions more on social programs than the Liberals would, so we've got that going. We do certainly stand more ideologically to the left than the LPC on social spending, and we've always stood that way. Granted, we are a fair bit further right than the days of Tommy Douglas, and while that does sadden me a little, the world of politics has swung far to the right since the 1980s and 90s.   If both awoke from their enchanted state, like Sleeping Beauty, and realized their slumbering unity (with a kiss) they’d easily win any federal election, about 2-1.    It's pretty obvious that we're not identical parties, and I think C-51 is a crystallization of that. We ideologically opposed it, and we voted against it. The LPC voted for it because ""it was an election year"". I think that's pretty telling of just one example of a massive ideological rift between the two. Besides, if the LPC and the NDP did merge, I'd be first on my way out to join whichever party formed from the center-left and left-wing flanks of our party.   The relevant examples are Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain. Both arose — suddenly and almost from nowhere — in societies shattered by austerity policies, which the main parties, left and right, rolled over for.    I don't think it's fair to compare Canada with Spain and Greece, the context just doesn't fit. For one, we're not experiencing a debt crisis, and we have our own central banks. We also haven't experienced a right-wing dictatorship in the past hundred years, so there's also that.  The rest of the article is just kinda nonsense comparing the situations of Spain to Canada, which once again, is really just not an apt comparison. The whole opinion piece really doesn't cut that deeply, and at the end of the day, we're two different parties with a different ideology."
CanadaPolitics,3d0s8q,jtbc,7,Sun Jul 12 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"or just an abandoning of FPTP in general.   The Liberal proposal is to establish an all party commission to look at the alternatives, including ranked ballot and proportional options, and report back within 18 months. They are also committed to implementing the selected alternative before the election.  MMP is the current NDP policy according to the policy book, but as far as I know, no specific platform commitment or timeline has been announced.  I don't understand why Salutin finds the Liberal position more democratic, other than the all-party input part and looking at multiple options, but that isn't what he said.   The LPC voted for it because ""it was an election year"".   They also voted for it because they agree with parts of it. They did author the post 9/11 anti-terrorism act. This is a real and substantive difference between the parties, though the gap probably isn't as large as the rhetoric would suggest, if you consider what they are likely to do in government.  The NDP position on federalism (Sherbrooke Declaration vs. Clarity Act), is similarly indicative of a real policy gap between the two parties.   Merging the two parties would be a much bigger deal than Salutin suggests, despite overlap on some issues. The parties don't have a shared history, as Reform and PC did. There are significant amount of Liberal and NDP members that would cut up their cards before accepting a merger with the other side."

CanadaPolitics,3cwyky,trollunit,16,Sat Jul 11 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"More like confusion reigns in Jeffrey Simpson's article.    silhqot’in essentially recognized aboriginal title over a swath of territory for a previously nomadic aboriginal group. In this territory, with a few restrictions, the group now has de jure sovereignty, a precedent that, if extended over time, would leave B.C. pockmarked with little self-governing, largely sovereign aboriginal territories over which the Crown’s writ would barely run.   This description of the holding of Tsilhqot’in is so amateurish to be basically meaningless. The concept of aboriginal title existed before this case, which further defined and clarified the concept. It was developed in a 1997 SCC case called Delgamuukw. The Delgamuukw test recognizes aboriginal title when the group sufficiently occupied the land prior to sovereignty and the occupation was exclusive.   Once made out, you get something a bit like common law title: a right to exclusively use and occupy the land and decide what happens to it, subject to the restriction that the use can't be inconsistent with the right of future generations of the group to use it.   But that doesn't mean, like Simpson outright states, that the government is powerless. That's absurd. Just like with aboriginal rights, the government can infringe aboriginal title as long as the test set out in Delgamuukw is satisfied. To justify it, the Crown has to show    that it discharged its procedural duty to consult and accommodate;  that its actions were backed by a compelling and substantial legislative objective; and  that the governmental action is consistent with any Crown fiduciary obligation to the group   Again, this has been the law since 1997. To the extent that Simpson is saying that this is the bad thing about Tsilhqot'in, he's completely wrong. To the extent that he's saying this will cripple BC's forestry and mining operations, he is verifiably wrong.   What's different about this case is that it establishes that semi-nomadic peoples can claim aboriginal title too. That makes sense. These people killed everyone that tried to come onto their territory, and defended it with martial superiority. They controlled it, even if they moved around throughout it. This was proven in the ~300 page trial judgement.    previously nomadic   This group has always been nomadic and they remain so today.    What’s clear about the Tsilhqot’in decision – and the long trail of previous aboriginal-rights cases – is that it makes for steady and remunerative work for lawyers.    See, thing about rights is...   Essentially, the courts, and especially the Supreme Court of Canada, are making laws in this field.   S. 35 is the law. If parliament didn't want courts to interpret it it would have set out specifically who is and who is not entitled to aboriginal title.    Their knowledge of on-the-ground realities is perforce limited and their interest in the actual or potential impacts of their decisions seems equally limited.   McLachlin was a UBC professor writing on corporate commercial law for many years, and a BC judge writing judgments on the same for many years. If Simpson would like to adduce some sort of support for his accusations I'd welcome it.    The aboriginal rulings are reminiscent of former justice Bertha Wilson’s comment in her famous Singh decision on refugee-determination policy when she dismissed possible complications flowing from her ruling as matters of “administrative inconvenience.” That “inconvenience” actually produced years of complication and chaos, huge financial costs, large backlogs and, of course, more work for lawyers.   This line in Singh referred specifically to the government's argument that Singh, some guy they were trying to deport to Sri Lanka where he was going to be tortured, should be denied procedural fairness because it would be too costly to arrange an oral hearing. Justice wilson said that when S. 7 is engaged in an admin law procedural fairness context, ""oral hearings are too costly"" is not a good argument for limiting it. While I struggle to see how that's relevant to aboriginal title I agree resoundingly. Though I get what Simpson is saying, generally, that the enforcement of rights can be expensive.    “considerations such as economic implications and political outcomes should be relevant to the judicial process, even if not determinative. It is troubling to us that no reference is made in the court’s decision to such possible implications.” Instead, they describe the Tsilhqot’in decision as a “technical treatise on the law, with didactic overtones.”   The court did in fact do this. the decision has actually been criticized by first nations activists for including a list of possible reasons to infringe title that is too broad, and contains too many economic considerations. from the judgement:   In the wake of Gladstone, the range of legislative objectives that can justify the infringement of aboriginal title is fairly broad. Most of these objectives can be traced to the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty, which entails the recognition that “distinctive aboriginal societies exist within, and are a part of, a broader social, political and economic community” (at para. 73). In my opinion, the development of agriculture, forestry, mining, and hydroelectric power, the general economic development of the interior of British Columbia, protection of the environment or endangered species, the building of infrastructure and the settlement of foreign populations to support those aims, are the kinds of objectives that are consistent with this purpose and, in principle, can justify the infringement of aboriginal title. Whether a particular measure or government act can be explained by reference to one of those objectives, however, is ultimately a question of fact that will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para. 165]    The Court clearly took into account economic objectives, though many think that this paragraph is not really permitted by s. 35 of the Charter.    (and long-shot candidate for the Supreme Court of Canada)   If some short-panted USask professor nobody has heard of replaces Rothstein it will be a strange day indeed.    Companies and aboriginal groups are getting on with negotiating deals (“muddling through,” as one astute B.C. observer said), with little attention being paid to Supreme Court rulings, while some of the more vocal provincial chiefs talk up court rulings, heap more demands on the governments and, in a few cases, head back to the courts seeking further expansion of aboriginal rights.   That's just not true. The decision is the stick, the development money is the carrot. My understanding is that the decision was an enormous boon to the negotiators.   If anyone wants to read commentary about this decision that isn't totally worthless, try this one or this one, both by leading downtown Vancouver law firms."

""Fiscally conservative"" and ""fiscally liberal"" are both relative terms.  What distinguishes a libertarian is a governing philosophy.  Libertarians are by definition in favour of the smallest government possible; the philosophy considers state taxation to be tantamount to theft, which means that government spending can be wrong even if it would be of net benefit to the public.  Political libertarians disagree about what level of government is necessary, but the key word there is necessary: government action must be justified as not just beneficial but essential to the public.  The Liberal party is generally willing to use government finances to buy things in the name of the public good.  In physical terms, this emphatically includes infrastructure; in social terms this includes funding for the status quo welfare state and significant transfer payments to families and the elderly.  In practice, the fiscal policies of the Liberal and Conservative parties have little daylight between them.  The parties take different stances now for partisan reasons, but most of the CPC platform could have been at one time the LPC platform, and vice versa.  At the moment, the CPC platform is hewing more closely to the ""no deficit ever"" line.  The NDP is much more closely a social democratic party, with a strong but not necessarily dominant socialist wing.  This party generally believes that the welfare state should be expanded.  Uniquely of the ""big 3"" parties, the NDP seems to prefer non-market delivery of its social policies.  The big-ticket campaign item for them is a child-care policy, for which they wish drastically limit the user-fees charged to parents."

CanadaPolitics,3cycdt,ChimoEngr,13,Mon Jul 13 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"Hey. Moderator of /r/LPC, the Liberal Party subreddit, here.  The Liberal Party of Canada is a moderate to moderate left party with a substantive fiscal record of being able to balance the books. Socially progressive and, in some circles, socially libertarian the Liberals in Canada have sometimes been referred to as being civil libertarians for their creation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, implementing the secret ballot, and working on the balanced framework of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities over the last century. The Liberals legalized marriage equality, fought for abortion access, and have worked on numerous civil libertarian issues.  Now, on the fiscal side, the Liberals have had rather excellent run in the last twenty years in being fiscally prudent. Investing in programs and trying to develop large investments in the public -- ranging from the Kelowna accords that would've spent billions on Canada's first nations and a cross-national housing strategy. Sadly, those two programs were nixed when the NDP voted with the Conservatives in 2006 to deliver the current Conservative government.  The Liberals ran the longest set of surpluses in Canadian history, much under Liberal MP Ralph Goodale. You can see a good selection of postings here: http://ralphgoodale.ca/the-goodale-fiscal-record/  So, there is a history that is at both nuanced and, in some senses, hug the centre of Canadian politics with a civil libertarian bent along with prudent fiscal management. I find I agree with the Liberals about 70% of the time and, honestly, that's good enough for me to support them as both a volunteer and a subreddit moderator.  Honestly, I've never really figured out what being ""fiscal conservative"" is, seeing that the Conservatives, when handed a budget surplus by the Liberals in 2006, started a long line of deficits and the largest debt in Canada's history. So, to be honest, not 100% sure what a fiscal conservative is anymore. Someone else might have to answer that for you."

Come on now.  I'm not a big fan of the CPC, but you've missed the real criticism for some attack lines.  ""The largest debt in Canada's history"" is only true in nominal terms, because inflation increases the dollar-cost of debt.  In real-goods terms, on both an inflation-adjusted and ratio-to-GDP basis, the Federal debt is quite small.  That phrase is also only meaningful because there has been a surplus.  For most countries that run small but sustainable deficits, every debt is the ""largest ever"" (nominally).  Additionally, the ""long line of deficits"" is not a uniquely CPC position.  The entire coalition kerfuffle of 2008-2009 was triggered because the initial CPC budget proposal did not have enough stimulus spending -- the coalition budget would have put Canada into a larger deficit.  What the CPC can be blamed for is serious, but wonkish.  The GST cuts in particular took what we now know was a large peak of the business cycle surplus and turned it into a balanced budget.  Of course, when the budget barely balances in a boom time then any economic slowdown will cause a deficit.  (On an extra-wonkish note, the GST is one of the most efficient, least-distorting taxes we have, and it should be the last thing cut.)  So in terms of the level of public spending, the LPC would have spent no less than the CPC from 2006 until today (and probably somewhat more).  The level of public taxation, however, would have been the most marked differene."

A decade old article by Jim Coutts, that anyone who wants can read here, identified these as:   Reform (at one time they party was actually called the reform party), in the sense of democratic reform, starting with responsible government, and social reform, exemplified by the introduction of the welfare state. French-English partnership, exemplified by the continuing tradition of altering leaders from each language group, the official languages act, and strong pro-federalism. Canadian identity, by which he means maintaining independence from first Britain, and now the US. He uses Chretien on Iraq as a recentish example.

I know you want to support the NDP as that's your persuasion, but you're skewing the facts on this particular level of government and this particular party to benefit your preferred party, and needlessly inserting yourself here. I believe this thread was originally about a redditor asking questions about the Liberals and the Libertarians.  (2) RE: C-51, the Liberals have stated that they would install a layer of civilian oversight through a non-partisan all-party committee of Members of Parliament, put in a sunset clause that'd auto-expire such legislation, and would curtail significant levels of powers that C-51 grants the federal government. If a Liberal government is elected in October expect massive portions of C-51 to be substantially reformed and Canadians rights to be respected again.  As an NDP supporter you well know that Mulcair has committed to repealing the worst parts of C-51... but would bring back aspects of the bill in his own bill if he ever becomes PM. Of course it'll be different, but no party should be saying they'll be absolutists on a particular bill. Rather, the discussion should be on investing in the right way to both protect Canadians' liberties and ensuring that we do not leave ourselves open to threats from terrorism. I'm rather sad that this conversation didn't happen in parliament, won't happen in the public, and definitely will be trod upon rather viciously in the general election.  (3) You're saying that different leaders bring different things to the table, and have different styles of doing things for the country. That's neither strange nor different. Rather, it's kept Canada together, met the challenges of the 20th century, and dealt with the issues of the day better than an ideological political force. I think it's a strength.  To be honest, I've always been uncomfortable with the NDP and the Conservatives over their need to be ideological ""pure"". Those types of organizations tend to be immoderate and engage in a centralizing effort like Harper's almost totalitarian control over his caucus or Mulcair's very vicious form of control over his own party. For both of those parties it's a very domineering system inside their organizations that have their leader at the forefront. Just as an example, it's the ""Harper Government"" or the veritable cult-like love that the NDP have for Layton (and more now with Mulcair). For the Liberals it's about Trudeau's team and the people he's surrounding himself to create a superior cabinet and a capable group of folks to take Canada into the 21st century.  As I've stated in the previous paragraph it's a personal preference and a choice that people have to make when they decide on the party they want to support in elections.

Another quibble I have with people who suggest increasing military expenditures, is that they never say what they want to spend it on.

In all rich countries, most health care costs are paid by insurers, either public or private, and insurance is all about pooling risk, which means you'll always be sharing costs with people you don't think are responsible. The only alternative I can imagine would be to outlaw health insurance: only the sick would have to pay for health care, but anyone who got very sick would either get bankrupted by the expenses of care, or would be unable to pay and die. I don't see how this is a desirable system.  I am also perplexed that you would see the US system as a model. They spend far, far more on health care than any other country—even their public health care spending alone is higher than Canada's, if I recall correctly—and seem to get little to show for the extra expense. The Netherlands uses a similar system to the U.S., but again their healthcare isn't obviously superior in any way I know of to health care systems in similar countries.  This is all apart from the fact that the federal government couldn't actually privatize health care; it could just abolish the Canada Health Act and hope that the provinces privatize it, which is something I doubt the provinces would be eager to do."

You're also onside with the large clean energy push (that you can read on www.realchange.ca with last week's announcement). I actually agree with you for the need for nuclear investment, but it's a scary word for the general electorate right now.  So you're 50% onside with the Liberals if those are your top concerns.

Any nation that turns so much of it's economy to a function that is ultimately destructive, and only at best, buys time for the citizenry to build, is rather sick. Also, if we invested that much into the CF, there would be a very large pressure to use it, and that would also be a bad thing. 2% is a more reasonable goal.   but with some safeguards in place so tax-dollars don't go to irresponsible individuals.   How do you define irresponsible individuals? Just the smokers and drug addicts, or can we expand it to young adults and kids partaking in high risk activities?

I want the government to subsidies clean energy, namely nuclear power, while keeping it private.   First, nukes are not the only form of clean energy. Second, if the government is going to sink a lot of money into power generation, something that is a natural monopoly, and is an essential public good, why should they turn control of it over to the private sector which has the single goal of making money and doesn't care that much about the public good?

Or in the very least, if we're now having numerous debates, set aside a couple for official parties, and allow the fringe (green, FetD, Bloc, and any other independents in the commons) to participate in a couple of others.  But it's outrageous to expect that the Greens, Bloc, and FetD be given the same pulpit and place in national debate air time as official parties.

Agreed. No idea how he linked their debate stance with C-51 or TPP. I'm also questioning the idea of a long-time NDP voter turning his back on the party when Jack Layton initially fought against Elizabeth May appearing in the 2008 debates.   I can't for the life of me understand why official party status isn't the cut off.    I think the problem people have with using official party status as a bar is that it would have excluded the NDP in past elections, as well as the Reform Party in 1993. People are probably going to hate this idea, but I think opinion polling should be the main bar. If you're consistently polling above a certain threshold (10 or 15% would be good IMO) nationally, you get a spot. Polls have been wrong about the winner, but they're good at detecting fringe parties. The previous election result can be a really bad indicator of a party's current viability. The Reform Party contested the 1988 Election and won 0 seats, then they won 52 seats in 1993.  Not that it matters anymore. The Consortium's hold has been broken, and we're having multiple debates, so who cares? The Green has a spot with the other parties in the Maclean's debate.

I'm happy to have a debate or two with all 6 parties with seats in the house and any other independents who care to join as well, it's nice to have a mix."

Depending on the threshold, they may well have been excluded. In any case, I still think it's a better metric than official party status. Ideally, I would also add running close to a full slate of candidates to the criteria, which the BC Conservatives also would have failed.   Furthermore, we then have to arbitrarily select a number to be the ""average opinion poll"" cut off, we have to determine which pollsters are credible enough to be in the average, etc.   It's worth pointing out that the concept of ""official party status"" itself is arbitrary.

This excerpt from the Canadian Superior Court Judges Association provides a more eloquent explanation than I did, as to why judges ought to remain impartial:   It is not enough for the judiciary, as an institution, to be independent - individual judges must be seen to be objective and impartial. In their personal lives, judges must avoid words, actions or situations that might make them appear to be biased or disrespectful of the laws they are sworn to uphold. They must treat lawyers, clients and witnesses with respect and must refrain from comments that suggest they have made up their minds in advance. Outside the courtroom, judges do not socialize or associate with lawyers or other persons connected with the cases they hear, or they may be accused of favouritism. Judges typically declare a conflict and withdraw from a case that involves relatives or friends. The same is true if the case involves a former client, a member of the judge's former law firm, law partners or a former business associate, at least until a year or two has passed since the judge was appointed and those ties were severed.  Judges often choose to avoid most forms of community involvement. A judge may undertake community or charitable work but cannot offer legal or investment advice. Judges cannot take part in politics, either as a party member, fundraiser or donor, and many choose to relinquish their right to vote. While judges have been more willing in recent years to make public speeches or agree to media interviews, they refrain from expressing opinions on legal issues that could come before them in a future case. Judges are forbidden from being paid to do anything other than their judicial duties, but can accept appointments to serve on royal commissions, inquiries and other official investigations.

Meanwhile, I like a lot of the things the NDP party have been saying lately and I voted for their candidate in the last election.

He uses that exact example with reference to aboriginal Canadians and pipelines almost every time.   What should stay is the parts that say that if you post on Facebook that you're going to go join isis to kill infidels, then buy a gun and a one way plane ticket, that you can expect to be asked some questions. All the bill does there is take parts of what csis was already doing under the table of no legislation and give them the official go ahead to do them.   What Trudeau has actually said is that if we're going to have these things they need substantial and powerful oversight. Something in line with what all of our allies have. It ain't rocket science."

CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,Vova_Poutine,4,Sat Jul 11 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"Cannot be trusted to follow through? By taking a stance on the bill and keeping it consistently over the last year? Have you even paid attention to the liberal position?   I can understand not liking c-51, I don't and that's fine, but to try and spin it as if the party is not committed to their decisions is just dumb, and then follow up by claiming they wont be committed to their announced policies based on c-51 is even dumber.   It could be a valid argument if, say, the party had started with one position in the fall, switched to another in the winter, switched again to some vague non-answer, then switched again to a final position once they saw a polling shift towards the bill (and also making their final announcement in a tweet wtf?).  But that's not what happened (for the liberals anyway). You do to have to vote for them, you don't have to like them at all, but the reasons should be thought out to some degree and not be in contradiction to reality."
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,PickledOnionz,3,Sat Jul 11 11:27:05 2015 UTC,"Trudeau's own words were that they were opposed to the bill in its current form, but voted for it anyways to avoid attack ads from the CPC. In other words, they vote not on their conscience but on whatever they feel will get them into power. So no, I dont trust them anymore after such a blatant admission that they will vote out of self interest rather than for what they feel is best for the country."

Part of the reason the LPC voted from c-51 was for content they approve of, part of the reason was to reduce the opportunity for fear tactics to be used on the issue of national security during the election.   You don't have to agree, but you should read the full context of Trudeau's answer to better understand it."

CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,_wtravis,2,Sat Jul 11 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"The liberals have been far more consistent than the NDP.  The NDP's stance came after months of feeling the winds and didn't solidify until well after the bill had been presented. Playing politics for votes is  opportunism and certainly not consistent.   First is was basic opposition, then it was amend, then there was a period where some people were saying repeal in fuzzy language, then it was flat out repeal. I think. It's hard to keep track, and most citations for that are from twitter or comments that leave a question mark like ""every offending provision"", implying that there may be some that weren't offending that wouldn't be repealed."

And if you read Trudeau's quote in that article, he almost says this is exactly why the Liberals voted for Bill C-51. And regardless of how they spin it, it's clear their position was 100% motivated by ""playing politics for votes"".   Yes, the NDP's position on the issue has evolved. So what? We're talking about whether or not the Liberal position has been consistent, not the NDP's. You're simply trying to refocus the conversation rather than addressing my point that they haven't been (despite OP's claim). (And I don't even disagree with you that the NDP's position has evolved, so sorry to let you down but you'll get no debate from me there.)

CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,_wtravis,2,Sun Jul 12 11:11:04 2015 UTC,Did you even read the article? It pretty clearly puts forward the same points that the LPC has made since October. The same points they've made for like 10 months now; Support for certain c-51 measures and a promise to amend with things more oversight. Did Trudeau say that voting for the bill was to remove it as a political football between the LPC and CPC? Yes.  Was it ever said that this was the only factor in deciding how to vote? Nope.   You can dislike and disagree with the party and it's policies but the one thing the LPC has been on c-51 is consistent. There's nothing to get away with.
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,PickledOnionz,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"I did, and is typical of the Huffington Post it does plenty of apologizing and spinning for your party of choice. But here's the most important quote, in case you missed it (it's in the headline, too):   “I do not want this government making political hay out of an issue … or trying to, out of an issue as important as security for Canadians,” Trudeau said. ""This conversation might be different if we weren’t months from an election campaign, but we are,” he added.   He says so himself (when speaking to a crowd of progressives) that the decision to vote unconditionally for Bill C-51 was politically motivated and would've been different if it weren't for those circumstances.   But show me where in their press release after the vote they explicitly say ""We're only doing this to stop the Conservatives from 'making political hay', otherwise we'd not be voting for it without amendments."" They don't. They say they support the bill, amendments or not, because it's important for Canada's security - i.e. even without amendments it's worth supporting. That's not consistent with ""we're doing this for political reasons otherwise we wouldn't support it unconditionally"". That's the opposite of consistent. That's a direct contradiction, actually. So yes, that is something they're trying to get away with, and no, their position is not consistent.   You're right that I dislike and disagree with the party (as much as you dislike mine, no doubt). I get that you're a partisan and you've bought into the spin that they've not changed their position - and it's your right to choose to believe it. That's fine. Hell, the NDP hasn't been consistent either (a common Liberal anti-NDP talking point on this issue), their position has evolved over time. I'm okay with that, and I'd be fine with the Liberals doing the same and being up front about it.   But what bothers me is trying to spin this back-peddling and damage control as consistent. The Liberals made a political decision (which I think was the wrong one) and voted for a draconian bill because it was popular in the polls at the time and it would position them as ""strong on terrorism"". But now that the draconian nature of the bill has become common knowledge, support for it - especially among progressives - has sharply declined, and now they're back-peddling. They're trying to spin their decision to vote for the bill as ""irrelevant"" or ""only to stop negative campaign ads"". Read some of the comments here from your fellow Liberal partisans. They say the same (if they're not busy attacking the NDP for anything and everything they can think of to shift the focus away from their party's position on the issue).    But ultimately, in my opinion (and clearly not yours), the NDP made the right call on refusing to vote for this draconian bill. The Liberals did not. It's honestly as simple as that. Now they're in damage control mode - and they're relying on partisans like you and many others, on reddit and elsewhere, to help them convince people they didn't get this important decision wrong. So I wish you the best of luck with that difficult task, but we're not going to change each other's minds on that."
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,_wtravis,2,Sat Jul 11 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"would've been different if it weren't for those circumstances   You're words.   This conversation might be different   Trudeau's words.   These are not the same. You are taking an open statement and assuming a definite result from it.   ""we're doing this for political reasons otherwise we wouldn't support it unconditionally""   Why do you keep putting quotes around your personal paraphrasing of  statements? That's not what a quote is and its incredibly disingenuous.   their position has evolved over time   Yes, following the polls as they have changed.  And finally,   popular in the polls at the time   There had been no polls released on C-51 at the time the LPC had announced their position.  Trudeau has said the same thing for 10 months, if you didn't pay attention that's you're own fault. Whining and finger pointing about partisanship adds literally nothing to your position. They have not back peddled, they have not switched their position."
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,PickledOnionz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"You're   Your. FTFY. I'd put the correction in quotes but that'd be disingenuous, I guess. ;-)   These are not the same.   No, they are not literally the same words. It's true. But the sentiment is the same, and that's my point. It's convenient to interpret it otherwise, but that's how I see it and I think that's pretty undeniably the intention behind what he's saying. If we were to read things without any context or subtext, then sure, I'd concede the point. But I also think it's naive to look at this so uncritically (even if it is convenient if you're a Liberal partisan).   Yes, following the polls as they have changed.   I don't think the pot has ever called the kettle black is such an intensely flagrant way. And you're conveniently forgetting that the NDP made their decision to vote against Bill C-51 in the face of polls showing overwhelming support for it at the time - so no, that position wasn't ""following the polls as they changed"", they made the right call despite what the polls were saying.   There had been no polls released on C-51 at the time the LPC had announced their position.   First of all: Source? Second of all: Even if there weren't any public polls it would be crazy for the Liberals not to have done internal polling and seen exactly what the public polls later confirmed very soon after.   Demanding that I ignore the political convenience and potential political motivation of the Liberal's half-baked position, given how it lined up with the polls at the time, and then slamming the NDP for ""following the polls as they changed"" is a pretty hilariously staggering hypocrisy, frankly - especially given the fact that the polls were overwhelming against the way the NDP was voting.   If they were only basing their position on polling data, well, their position would probably look at a lot more on the fence. They probably would've voted in favour of the bill but tried to spin it by saying that they had lots of reservations and maybe only did it because of the political circumstances. Gee, that sounds familiar... ;-)"
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,_wtravis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"Good, when someone starts correcting grammar it means they don't have anything of substance left to contribute. Saweet.  Whole lot typed out there that doesn't say much of anything beyond a bunch of personal, unprovable prepositions.  Saying the LPC is consistent in there position is not a justification for voting for the bill, it's literally just pointing out that they have been consistent. A large motivator for the NDP is that they portray themselves as occupying some moral high ground, that they operate differently than other parties. This may have been different in the past but we've seen Mulcairs NDP shift considerably away from the NDP of the 2000's, both in policy and in behaviour. Following the polls on this issue and coming out saying that they would repeal c-51 only after it was safe to do so shows that they do operate like a typical political party. And that's all fine, they eventually got around to it and have safety locked up the anti c-51 crowd, which is important for the coming election.   If you want to criticize the LPC for voting for c-51 that's fine, there's lots wrong with the bill, but it should focus on actual parts of the bill that are unwarranted. Trying to present their position as changing or inconsistent is wrong, Trudeau has said the same thing for almost a year in every setting and interview about c-51. Its clearly projection of the main flaw in the NDP's position, which was fluid for the majority of the debate, to try and claim there is inconsistency.   Criticize actual events and policy, you don't have to make things up to find material."
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,PickledOnionz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:34:54 2015 UTC,"Haha well I guess if you stopped reading after that one line it does. I still make that mistake lots too when I'm writing in a hurry! Just trying to help. :-)   Whole lot typed out there that doesn't say much of anything beyond a bunch of personal, unprovable prepositions.  A large motivator for the NDP is that they portray themselves as occupying some moral high ground, that they operate differently than other parties.    I mean, c'mon.   Sure, that's your perception, and that's fine. But that's about as subjective as it gets. That kind of flies in the face of repeatedly accusing me of not saying anything of substance.   Criticize actual events and policy, you don't have to make things up to find material.   I mean again, look at what you just wrote to criticize the NDP.  ""The NDP... portray themselves as occupying some moral high ground"". That's neither an actual event nor policy. That, and your insinuation that they're somehow hypocritical for not living up to this perception you have because their position has moved from ""repeal parts of C-51"" to ""repeal all of C-51"" is just your subjective opinion of the party. (It's an opinion I could easily have of the Liberals too, or literally any other political party. Every party tries to portray themselves as morally superior to their rivals.)   In the rest of that paragraph you continue to beat the ""they're just following the polls"" point you made, but continue to ignore how they took a stand on the issue, and stood by it, that was wildly unpopular at the time. The Liberals are the ones who chose the position that was safe according to the polls at the time, and are now paying the price for it politically among their base of centre-left voters. Hence, trying to spin their vote as either ""irrelevant anyway"" or ""only because of political circumstances"" when pressed by progressive voters. (Talking points often repeated by Liberal partisans in this very sub.)  Regardless, nothing I've written here is something I've just ""made up"". It's based on the sources I cited earlier in this debate. So here they are again:   ""This bill can be improved, but on the whole, it does include measures that will help keep Canadians safer. As such, we will support it."" - Justin Trudeau, February 4, 2015  “But we know that, tactically, this government would be perfectly happy if the opposition completely voted against this bill because it fits into their fear narrative and [their desire to] … bash people on security.” “I do not want this government making political hay out of an issue … or trying to, out of an issue as important as security for Canadians,” “This conversation might be different if we weren’t months from an election campaign, but we are,” he added. - Justin Trudeau, March 9, 2015   That last part is key. ""The conversation might be different"" if not for the political situation. To me, as I've been saying here, if you look at the context, it's pretty hard not to see what he's saying as meaning anything other than ""We might not have voted the way we did"". Especially on the heels of saying ""this government would be perfectly happy if the opposition completely voted against this bill"". Honestly, you're free to disagree with my interpretation and I have no problem with that. But I didn't just ""make it up"" out of nothing at all, and it's disappointing you're resorting to accusing me of that to defend your position, rather than addressing what I'm actually saying.  Hey, I'll give you that they've consistently unconditionally voted in favour of Bill C-51 in the House of Commons. That's true. Or that they've consistently defended voting for the bill unconditionally in all their official party literature (website, flyers, etc.). But when speaking off-script, in a panel or on Twitter, the messaging has been very different - not at all consistent with aforementioned official sources like their website or press release that use their earlier justification for voting in favour of the bill. The talk with UBC students is a clear example of this inconsistency in messaging."

At the time, there was huge support across the country for the security legislation and some Liberals feared Mr. Harper would call a snap election and then portray himself and his party as the champions of security.   Trudeau's speech made global news of how to deal with terrorism. They were doing so great at going against the stuff Harper wanted to do. Him helping pass C-51 felt like it went completely against the amazing thing he said: ""Criminals can not and will not dictate how we act as a nation, how we govern ourselves, or how we treat each other."".   If I have to be serious, I believe the liberals would do better economically. I think their plans on democracy are good, but when 200,000 people march down the street to say they want this bill repealed and he still is for it, why do his plans on democracy matter when people know he's not listening.  He said some of the toughest things against terrorism and that toughness was undone when the huffington post caught him saying this would be different if it wasn't an election year. He showed fear of Conservative attack ads and that he was going to do things to get elected and not for the good of the nation.  note I'm on an iPad and it's really hard to type."

Liberals supported the bill in part because they support some of its provisions (as do critics such as the Canadian Bar Association and UofO professors Forcese and Roach), and felt they couldn't vote against those parts.  The positions of the other two leaders was equally political. They are just less honest about it. Mulcair's initial position was very similar to Trudeau's (keep the bill, but amend the bad parts) until he smelled a winner by taking a stronger anti- stance."
CanadaPolitics,3ctqph,jtbc,10,Fri Jul 10 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"Like Mr. Fenik, Diane Freeman, a professional engineer and veteran city councillor in Waterloo, says she was a Liberal member for the past 10 years – but turned in her membership in March. Mr. Trudeau’s position on Bill C-51 was the last straw. “It fundamentally undermines civil liberties of Canadians. There was no requirement for the Conservatives to need the support of the opposition.” She is now the NDP candidate for Waterloo, a riding held by the Conservatives. She was approached by the NDP to run.   That's news to me, where has she been and why have I never met her? I've been active here for years now and haven't seen her anywhere near any local Liberal activity. Not exactly an ironclad commitment to the party there. I've met Waterloo city councillors while volunteering or at events before (because they're members and they care!), it's not like she never had the time to come and say hello to her fellow local Liberals.   I highly doubt C-51 was the last straw, our nomination race was underway for about 8 months before C51 became a thing and she had plenty of opportunity to contest it just like another former city councillor did.   The more prevalent narrative in the community is that she was party-shopping. The NDP nomination was uncontested but Bardish Chagger, our LPC candidate, was well positioned to clean her clock in our nomination race. Why not take the easy way out and be acclaimed with a party that seems to be suddenly on the rise?"

With the oversight proposed by the Liberals, Conservative MP's would have been able to monitor the RCMP investigators. They would also be able to interrupt the investigation by call them in for questioning over pedantic details if they got close to finding evidence.

CanadaPolitics,3culvr,PopeSaintHilarius,3,Sat Jul 11 17:32:01 2015 UTC,"Sure, basically, I've been persuaded that a huge part of high home prices and rent in urban centres is due to poorly conceived zoning and land-use. Basically regulations like height restrictions, parking requirements and other density restrictions make it extremely difficult to build new housing in cities. In the past this drove urban sprawl, but now its mostly driving prices up as sprawl is unsustainable. So I think we should pretty much upzone the entire country. This will bring down housing costs, raising the real incomes of everyone, while also creating better cities with less pollution, walkable neighborhoods and shorter commutes. If you ever wonder why we don't build neighbourhoods like the old European cities or some Northeastern cities, its because we banned them.  The other components is a land-value-tax. Land value taxes tax the value of land directly, not improvements built on it. This encourages the best possible land-use, unlike property taxes. Additionally, the huge increase in wealth inequality is heavily driven by land values, so this is a superb way to tax the richest and raise money. We could either use the money to expand our social democracy (my preferred option) or just cut other taxes.  They are sort of esoteric reforms that aren't on any major party platform, but they have bipartisan potential and are almost universally liked by experts. Here is a great article from the economist.  Edit: these changes happen at all levels government, not just federal. Nonetheless, I'd like to see the federal government taking some action here. For example, national zoning guidelines and an LVT could be national."

And even if there is a written constitution, it's not like you can know what is or isn't against it just by looking.  They're deciding these things as they go along.  For example, look at the Insite decision.  Given the last 70 years of how Canadian law was applied, you would have thought that the feds were correct in treating Insite as they did, and in fact they were incredibly lenient for not coming in there all War on Drugs-style.  But all of the sudden and out of nowhere, the laws are unconstitutional.  This was a case where the right result was achieved, but in a way that is deeply troubling.  I don't really know how you can fault the feds for not divining the whims of the Court before it's expressed.

It's probably not the best way, but I do appreciate the intent even if the execution is flawed. This is going to sound really dumb but it's honestly the vibe I get in this country: the lack of official oversight on paper isn't as important as it seems in today's society. Things have gotten to such a state with technological literacy in general that it's hard for a government to get away with egregious violations. I mean of course they will try, but these old fashioned fears of dictatorship don't make sense to me in this age and in this country.   For sure there are incidents and policies that arent okay...but given the complexity of managing certain risks, sometimes we aren't going to get it 100% right. In a country that goes through periods of minority governments and a lot of collaboration at times, the big-picture oligarchy dystopia fears don't make a ton of sense to me.  So while I agree you can isolate this or that in the bill and feel a bit uneasy, I don't believe that it will be utilized to that extent.

This issue is finally highlighting the dissatisfaction students have with FEDS, and I hope change can come to the organization, which is supposed to exist for the students rather than themselves."
CanadaPolitics,3ctzar,lomeri,12,Fri Jul 10 20:15:25 2015 UTC,"That sounds a lot like something the University of Victoria Students' Society would do. In a previous AGM, they were intending to vote on a controversial issue. When they saw how many students showed up to vote against it, a few of the executives up and left so there would no longer be quorum, (the AGMs require a certain number of students and a certain number of executives present.) This prevented a vote on the issue and ended the meeting. I believe they later voted on the issue in a meeting with fewer students present, and it passed."

We're talking university campuses, here, the most progressive spots in Canada, arguably, and the Canadian fabric already sees high support for gay marriage, universal protection against discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation, long-running and very successful Pride parades in every major city, and legislation on the books protecting equality as a general concept for over 50 years, now, since the Bill of Rights.   Where are these looming threats and bogeymen that they need protection from?  Overwhelmingly, what they are being protected from is contrary opinion, and unless there's some rationale for why hearing contrary opinion is damaging, experiencing dissonance from within the community is supposed to be part of the university experience.  These are not safe spaces, these are privileged spaces, spaces where the normal debate gets shut off, so that one group has a guaranteed microphone."

If you feel uncomfortable when somebody voices their opinion when you're in university, you will have an extraordinarily difficult time when you get out into the real world. There will be people whose opinions differ from yours, and there isn't a whole lot you can do to change this.  I like the quote in the article ""If you don’t feel ‘safe’ making decisions in public, don’t seek public office"". If you don't feel safe in university, voicing your opinions or listening to opinions, don't go to university, voice your opinions or listen to opinions."

The numbers are seasonally adjusted and there are other factors such as timing or a overall shift from part time to FT work that can explain it.   There was a gain of 143K in q2 for full time work with a 110k decline for part time (seasonally adjusted) so it seems that there has been a recomposition of the job types in q2.

In fact, even now Stephen Harper is still going around from question-free photo-op to question-free photo-op, running on the economy but just fearmongering that the NDP will turn us into Greece.    I said Harper has the worst record on job creation and economic growth in 80 years. That speaks for itself."

CanadaPolitics,3csl1q,d-boom,0,Fri Jul 10 14:51:19 2015 UTC,I don't know why they bother reporting the monthly job numbers. The data is so fuzzy as to essentially be useless.
CanadaPolitics,3csl1q,NoMoreTFWs,9,Fri Jul 10 15:17:27 2015 UTC,"They've been doing it for decades. Just like the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States and quite frankly most OECD countries.  It's not just about another disastrous month for the Canadian labour market. It's not just about the 6,400 jobs we lost in June.   If you look at the actual Labour Force Survey from Statscan, which I highly recommend:  http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150710/dq150710a-eng.htm?HPA  It offers a treasure trove of information regarding industries, work force demographics, how each province is doing, & short, mid and long term analysis.   It contains a lot of critical information that the private sector covets and uses.   I couldn't disagree more with your statement.   Although to be honest, with the drastic cuts on Statscan imposed by the Harper Conservatives, the information is less reliable. This was put on full display early this year when Statscan had to revise downwards the entire 2014 job creation by 33%.   Canada gained 121,300 jobs last year, not 185,700, Statistics Canada says in major labour survey revision"
CanadaPolitics,3csl1q,d-boom,5,Fri Jul 10 15:20:25 2015 UTC,The data statscan collects and publishes is certainly useful. The big problem I have is that a month is not a good time interval to use to determine the overall economic picture. There is too much volatility in the monthly numbers. Quarterly and yearly data smooths out some of the noise and gives a better picture of trends.
CanadaPolitics,3csl1q,NoMoreTFWs,6,Fri Jul 10 15:51:17 2015 UTC,"They offer quarterly and annual analysis on top within their monthly report. Going 3 months without any information on the labour market is, in my opinion, ridiculous. This is exactly the problem we're having right now with the overly delayed GDP numbers. We just recently got the April numbers and we're into July. Timely economic data is of critical importance in the 21st century. There's nothing wrong with providing revisions in later monthly reports as more information comes in. That's exactly what the BLS does.    employment grew by 33,000 (+0.2%) in the second quarter.    Not a pretty picture. Not at all. We should be creating that many jobs in 1 month, not 3. Especially if we ever want to have any hope of putting a dent into the 1.3 million of Canadians who find themselves unemployed. Otherwise they're more and more are just going to become discouraged and drop out of the labour force altogether.   Edit: Changed wording to make it clear that I obviously didn't think that ALL the unemployed would become discouraged."
CanadaPolitics,3csl1q,Palpz,4,Fri Jul 10 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"Especially if we ever want to have any hope of putting a dent into the 1.3 million of Canadians who find themselves unemployed. Otherwise they're just going to become discouraged and drop out of the labour force altogether.    The rate at which that occurs is very low. Usually within the 0.1 and 0.2% range.  You tend not to get massive amount of people just giving up, even if the overall unemployment numbers are staying steady, largely because just because the numbers are the same, doesn't mean that it's the same people staying unemployed.   The average duration of unemployment is just over 21 weeks. A full third of unemployed people find new employment within four weeks.  It's not like we're talking some massive group of people who never have jobs versus the rest of everyone who has rock stable employment. There's a whole lot of shifting going on, in both directions."

CanadaPolitics,3ct8bh,darkretributor,3,Fri Jul 10 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"Mortgage broker Lou Perrotta said that in terms of volume, 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the mortgages he puts together are now privately financed, typically because borrowers are declined for a bank loan for reasons like a low credit rating or unsteady income.   Isn't this the exact same sub-prime mortgage fiasco that the US had to deal with?  Edit: I guess (so far) the portion of mortgages that are sub prime is lower than it was in the US. And we're not securitizing these mortgages and selling them with dubious credit ratings (as far as I know)."
CanadaPolitics,3ct8bh,Move_Zig,4,Fri Jul 10 18:11:52 2015 UTC,"No, these loans would be held entirely on private balance sheets.

Bingo, this is the big one.  If housing prices fall, then those private investors currently earning 9% are going to be seriously hurt.  But that's okay, because what it won't do is cause big financial firms to collapse.  The big problem with the subprime mess in the States was that these loans were bundled and used as collateral for other loans.  When the housing market fell, suddenly a lot of collateral wasn't worth what the banks and financial firms expected it would be worth, and margin calls are serious business."

They seem to be failing at it this election though.  In terms of FPTP - I expect this sort of instability to persist.  There's a left-centre-right spectrum competing for attention with a sovereigntist-nationalist-federalist spectrum, and FPTP (and instant run-off voting) does a really poor job of capturing that complexity.  I'd expect Quebec's party system to be unstable until we get a proportional electoral system.

It is a fair argument to make for excluding the Greens in 2008, and perhaps why FeD hasn't been offered a place in the debates now. Obviously, I don't think the argument is applicable now that May was elected under the Green's banner.  IIRC, The big reason why Elizabeth was initially excluded though was because she had a cooperation pact with Stephane Dion (neither would run candidates against each other) at the time, as opposed to having an elected MP. The NDP's opposition to her inclusion and their collusion with the Conservatives was what really made the decision controversial."

I would actually agree with that, and that would be a good reason for excluding F&D. Doesn't eliminate the Greens or Bloc though."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,bunglejerry,3,Fri Jul 10 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"5% and a seat in parliament are roughly equivalent.  Only once in all of Canadian history has a party received 5% of the vote and not won a seat - the Greens in 2008.  Here's the trouble though - how do you make that criteria forward looking? It would have disqualified the Reform and Bloc in 1993, and it was pretty damned relevant to have them included in those debates."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,3,Fri Jul 10 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"how do you make that criteria forward looking?   The simple answer is, you don't.  There's no obligation for the consortium to be forward looking on who may win.  As soon as you start trying to guess who is relevant, you open yourself up to perfectly reasonable accusations of favoritism.  Having a standard rule based on actual performance has it's flaws, but it would at the very least be consistent."

I really don't see why the Globe or Munk should be a slave to the Consortium's past precedents.  I thought the point of having multiple organizations host debates was to try out different sets of formats and rules. The current polls make it impossible, but if this was a typical election, I would have liked to see a debate between just the leaders of the top two parties."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,6,Fri Jul 10 14:19:44 2015 UTC,They shouldn't. But Tom Mulcair should stand up for the right thing here - giving the Greens the same shot the NDP were given when they didn't have official party status.

Layton and Duceppe both opposed such a debate.  These ""extra"" debates will likely be one on one between Harper and Mulcair if they happen at all."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,bunglejerry,3,Fri Jul 10 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I remember that. IIRC it was mostly grandstanding and bluff-calling. Wasn't it an offhand comment of Harper's that Ignatieff seized on? Good for Ignatieff for doing so, but it's no real surprise it didn't happen.  There are other debates, though, that feature different combinations of party leaders. This one, for example, if it's still on."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:52:43 2015 UTC,Right.  Trudeau hasn't accepted that due to the lack of French.

Harper then stepped up and said he would champion the federalist position and debate Duceppe in French. Duceppe backed down from that."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,2,Fri Jul 10 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"To add to what bunglejerry said, times are different. In the past, the Consortium Debates were the only show in town. Now, we've got multiple debates. May is getting debate exposure, just not as much as the top three. That feels right to me.  I get what you're saying. I would be upset if there wasn't a debate including the four main leaders. But MacLean's has done it, so the Globe and Munk shouldn't feel obligated to follow suit. Like I said, more diversity in formats is better. If there was a clear top two (like in almost every past election), I would want a debate with just the two leaders. I also wouldn't mind seeing a ""mega-debate"" where they invite every single registered party leader."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,3,Fri Jul 10 16:44:29 2015 UTC,"May is getting debate exposure, just not as much as the top three.   Actually, exactly as much as Trudeau.  Trudeau has already said he won't attend if May isn't invited.  Mulcair should say the same.  He doesn't be cause he puts his advancement ahead of his principles.  Rational self interest normally doesn't bother me, but in this case I find it pretty distasteful, especially given the NDP's supposed commitment to democratic reform."

The Green party is in a dead heat for fourth place in the polls with a likelihood of landing fifth.  Regardless of personal feelings about how Elizabeth may is a hard worker or a good speaker she has not moved the Green party forward in terms of creating an alternative.  The Green Party is not a major player, and unless something changes in the next couple of months they will not be.  It isn't the debate holders job to make the Green Party a relevant alternative to Canadian Voters.  It isn't like Elizabeth May is being shut out entirely, and one can make a very reasonable case that her party doesn't deserve to be involved (or the Bloc for that matter).    There isn't a moral issue here, this is Pierre Trudeau trying to generate an issue for political expedience."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,2,Fri Jul 10 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"The Green party is in a dead heat for fourth place in the polls with a likelihood of landing fifth.   Like the NDP in the 1990s.

Yes, exactly the same.   Of course the NDP also had at that point shown they were capable of winning double digits in terms seats and popular vote over multiple elections. So really not even remotely similar.  The Green Party has not at any point in their history shown the ability to meet a fairly low bar of winning one seat and winning 5%. If they accomplish that this time around I will happily advocate for their spot in the next elections debate.      It's about democracy.   Do we give the Christian Heritage party a place if they run more candidates?  What about independents , who in terms of winning seats have proven themselves to be just as effective."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"The real bar has been whether or not another party would go to bat for them.  In 2008 Dion threatened to withdraw from debates that didn't include the Greens.  That shamed the NDP into also calling for their inclusion.  Based on the LPC's previous statements w.r.t both language and inclusion of other leaders, I don't expect the Liberals to participate in these debates.  The Liberals are only the third party now though, so the organizers may not care.  If the NDP would also step up to give the Greens the same opportunity they were given when they weren't an official party this would be a done deal.    So the ball is in Mulcair's court."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,CupOfCanada,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:02 2015 UTC,I expect the NDP to ignore the Greens fully. They're fighting over several ridings in BC and Mulcair seems to be the type to be unforgiving on any threats. How quickly they have forgotten to be on the otherside of the ballroom.
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,FilPR,3,Fri Jul 10 16:32:30 2015 UTC,Exactly.  It says a lot about what the current NDP is quickly becoming.

CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,danjahjno,2,Fri Jul 10 21:44:09 2015 UTC,"The decision made by these two organizations is somewhat disappointing.  May is as intelligent as any of the leaders that have been invited.  She has a reputation of being extremely hard-working, specifically in terms of studying the details of much of the legislation that has been passed over the past 4 years.  On that basis May's presence might actually raise the level of both debates rather than be a distraction, which seems to be the concern.  The real benefit for most electors is that - by being involved on the debate stage - May would be in an excellent position to directly challenge questionable assertions made by any of the other leaders.  Any votes that May might be able to dislodge wouldn't necessarily migrate to the Green Party, but that is a different issue - at least voters could be better informed.  OTOH, I can't identify a single personal change that these two decisions will induce."
CanadaPolitics,3csfm5,patadrag,2,Fri Jul 10 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"Given the way that May has behaved in past debates, is it really so stunning?  When you make Steven Harper look sympathetic, you're probably doing it wrong."

It's no different than taking out a mortgage to buy a house.

For example, a government might believe that a certain tax cut isn't beneficial to society overall, compared to other uses of the money. However if they believe that it would appeal to a large number of voters in the short run and would help them get re-elected, which would allow them to make other changes that they genuinely believe are beneficial to society, then they could use that rationale to justify (to themselves) doing a tax cut that is good politics and bad policy.

That being said, the best course of action would have been to legislate debates a year or two into their most recent mandate. Form an independent committee to set the ground rules and to determine who should be holding these things.

Maybe not all of it, but TV still reaches 75% of the 18-35 population (can you tell it's pulled from my marketing texts?) in an average week and I don't think that's going to be cut in half or anything over the next ten years.  As for Harper not going to the consortium debates, my quibble is generally about reducing TV exposure in this election.

Based on the left-wing echo chamber they have created, of course.  If you didn't see it before, now it is clear for all to see: They refuse to air election debates that include the Prime Minister, and instead press ahead with debates with only left-wing parties.  Instead of accepting the fact they no longer have control as gatekeepers, they choose brinkmanship with one political party.    The credibility of the Consortium members is lost.

Instead of accepting the fact they no longer have control as gatekeepers, they choose brinkmanship with one political party.   Again the consortium are not breaking the status quo here. A single party figures it fits their narrative of being an outsider/little guy under attack, even though they have been in power for 10 years, so they picked a fight to rile up there base and hopefully bully their way to favorable terms, nothing more."

It ensures that any one actor who has a vested interest in the outcome of it can't control the entire thing by playing them against each other, like the PM is trying to do with his B/S power play.   The bullshit powerplay is from the Media Consortium.  Harper's power play is completely in line with any political actor, including the other political parties.

Again the consortium are not breaking the status quo here.    They are when they organize debates without the Prime Minister.   If the consortium said they didn't want the PM, you'd have a case, but since it is the other way around, you don't. The PM is breaking the status quo by refusing the consortiums invite.

CanadaPolitics,3cpjmp,joecdn,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:01:14 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how one power play is legitimate, yet the other is not?   Sure.  Political parties are there to do politics, and the Media Consortium is not a political party.  The news media should impartially and objectively report on events, not become a political actors in the election.  This is journalistic ethics 101, and the Consortium has left their ethics by the wayside.   I see it more as the PM being spiteful, while the consortium is attempting to fulfill their mandate of informing the public at large, which is part of the deal that gets them primacy on the dial.   If they really want to fulfill their public service mandate, the Consortium will broadcast the actual Leaders Debates.  But by going ahead with the Opposition Debates, knowing the PM will never attend, the Consortium becomes a political actor in the election, contrary to journalistic ethics.  And if the Consortium is trying to persuade the PM to attend the Opposition Debates, then that's even worse because the Consortium is trying to influence political actors and change the outcome of events.  Journalistic integrity seems like such a quaint idea these days.   The PM is breaking the status quo by refusing the consortium invite.   And I applaud him for that.  Go Harper.  We'll get better debates as a result, and the Media Consortium's power and arrogance will be diminished.   If he'd set up the other debates and attended the consortium's it would be a legit competition.   That's some high-level cognitive dissonance you've got going there.  A ""legit competition"" does not mean the Consortium automatically gets to host the debates, it means they don't.  And Harper didn't ""set up"" the leaders' debates, he invited others to do that, and along with all the other political parties, he accepted 4 proposals.     AS it is, he just comes off as spiteful.   The spiteful party here is the Media Consortium.  Their proposal wasn't accepted, and they're acting like a bunch of sore losers.  But what is actually more concerning, is they are behaving like a partisans, not journalists."

Since they never had a monolopy, it didn't need to be justified. Many debates take place during the election at the riding level (often without the CPC candidate, but that is another matter). No one forced the leaders to only attend the debates held by the consortium, it was that those debates gave the biggest bang for the buch as far as talking to the whole country went. Anyone else could have attempted to set up another debate prior.

The consortium has traditionally had a monopoly on a national level, due to the CRTC rules that have forced cable providers to prioritize their networks. Back in the day, even people who didn't have cable still had access to CBC, Global, and CTV via analogue signals from broadcast towers. Since these networks chose to not compete, they have traditionally been a monopoly. The internet has only recently changed this.    No one forced the leaders to only attend the debates held by the consortium, it was that those debates gave the biggest bang for the buch as far as talking to the whole country went.   National media with mandated availability to all Canadians by the CRTC is the commodity he was referring to. Therefore, the consortium was the only option to access Canadians without cable, or in remote areas where cable wasn't even available. This was critical for reaching aboriginals on reserves."
