ghibli,3e1ntc,Vulcan_domino,4,Tue Jul 21 07:13:47 2015 UTC,"The future of Studio Ghibli is very uncertain. Whether this current hiatus leads to future productions or not remains unknown. The challenge, simply, is to make enough money to be profitable, while keeping the high standard of quality Ghibli represents.  If you can create animated feature films that earn $100 at the Japanese box office, then Ghibli can succeed. If the films only earn $25 million (From Up on Poppy Hill, Princess Kaguya, When Marnie Was There), Ghibli cannot. And that's the real problem. The studio is built, almost specifically, for Hayao Miyazaki blockbusters. And even Miyazaki's last feature (The Wind Rises) failed to earn a profit, despite making over $120 million in Japan.  How do you make hand-drawn animated features at a time when the public is only interested in Disney-style CG? Forget about quality; nobody can touch Studio Ghibli for quality movies. The public only wants computer-graphics cartoons that are mostly interchangable, follow the same formulas, and are very fast and flashy. How much money did ""Minions"" make so far? More than all the Ghibli theatrical runs in the US, that's for sure.  We'll be closely watching Goro-san's next move. Perhaps he is finally settling into his role and becoming more comfortable in his skin? Perhaps Yonebayashi will continue to grow as an artist? Perhaps other directors like Yoshiyuki Momosa (Capsule videos, Ni no Kuni) will craft a feature film? Or maybe Paku-san returns with another film project and funding, hot on the heels of his Oscar nomination?  Tough to say for now. Hayao Miyazaki will continue to work on smaller-scale projects, such as his recently-announced Ghibli Museum short film, but it's not yet known what their next move will be. The old Toei Animation model of lavish, high-production animated feature films may be coming to an end in Japan.  We will be watching closely for any developments."

Not a lot of people have been buying bluray and dvd has still survived, unlike the vhs to dvd switch. Due to the fact that bluray isn't as popular, not a lot of media that came out before bluray will make the switch other than highly popular or important media. My Neighbors the Yamadas is not popular enough for them to take a chance to put it on bluray because they likely wouldn't make a profit."

Recently though they've been releasing large waves of blurays. The Spirited Away re-release was in one of those waves. A lot of older less popular movies were released too, such as Journey to the Far Side of the Earth. So there's a chance they'll release it, and if bluray catches on then there's even more chance for a release. For now though I wouldn't count on it. If you want the complete collection i'd go for the DVD for now."
ghibli,3dh4zp,ghibliblog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, with it being the only one left that's only on dvd I wonder if they're just going to skip it. And I don't even know who has the rights to Only Yesterday and Ocean Waves, if Disney has them I doubt they'll release them, but if GKids gets them they'll probably release them at some point!"
ghibli,3dh4zp,costofanarchy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"If Disney allows those films to be released by another publisher, such as GKids, then those films will be released. But in the case of Omohide Poro Poro, I don't think it will ever be released in the USA because of its content (there is a scene of a nine-year-old girl in a public bath house). Nobody's willing to risk their company or their job over a potential scandal, real or imagined.  Umi ga Kikoeru is probably too obscure for a US release, and there may also be rights issues with the Japanese TV network that aired the film in 1993. There may also be song rights issues, as well. Now that I think about it, Poro Poro used a lot of licensed music as well. Perhaps ""Zamfir, Master of the Pan Flute"" is holding out for his million-dollar paycheck?  As for Yamadas, the DVD just didn't sell. It's not popular enough to justify a BD release, especially when Disney doesn't care much about Studio Ghibli anymore. They can't sell toys, they can't spin off the characters into other commercial properties, they can't put Totoro onto a Disneyland float...so what's the point?  Again, your best option is to import the Japanese BDs. That situation is unlikely to change anytime in the near future."

ghibli,3dh4zp,ghibliblog,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"You can get the Japanese Blu-ray, although it's pricy.  It seems strange that this one (My Neighbors the Yamadas) is being left out, but it has significantly fewer ratings on IMDb than other ""relatively obscure"" Ghibli films.  It has fewer than half the ratings of Pom Poko, and far fewer viewings than The Cat Returns or Tales from Earthsea.  It even has fewer ratings than Only Yesterday (never officially released in the U.S.), and barely more ratings than Ocean Waves.  I'll wait a while (maybe a year), and import it if it doesn't show up.  It's nowhere near among my favorites, but I'd like to have a complete collection, and I'm sure I'll want to see it down the road, and like lending out my movies to others when introducing them to the Ghibli catalogue.  On the other hand, I think Only Yesterday is a top notch movie, and I highly recommend you get it if you can afford the import cost.  As for Ocean Waves, I've never seen it, and I wasn't sure what to do, and I just googled it on a whim (while writing this comment), and I see that it releases in Japanese tomorrow!  I will definitely be importing this, as I'm doubting a U.S. release.  It's possible that GKids will pick it up, but even if they do, we'd be quite far from a U.S. release."

ghibli,3dddz7,solstice_of_light,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:59 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking of collecting Ghibli, then get the individual copies. This collection only has Miyazaki's works, and aesthetically doesn't match the other releases.  Still; it's a very nice collection in its own rights."
ghibli,3dddz7,Kolop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:43:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That's a good point, I didn't realise Studio Ghibli makes movies without him so I'll have to purchase them separately anyway. The artwork on these is nice though, but you're right it won't match"
ghibli,3dddz7,Kolop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:30 2015 UTC,It is 11 movies for 27 a piece essentially. You should just buy them off Amazon. Almost all of the blurays+DVD combos are on right now for less than 20 a piece and the quality is fantastic. The only issue I have with the new blurays are dubtitles and the new Totorro dub.  Edit* (Whoops! Just saw that you said it was 185 USD which is 17 a piece. I still stand by my previous reccomendation though as the Blu rays are really great and the price will be similar to what that boxset will run you.)

ghibli,3d9tyx,panda_cupcake,3,Tue Jul 14 16:57:02 2015 UTC,"They do contain the Japanese dubbing. The only issue is that some of the blurays have ""Dub titles."" Instead of a literal translation they just have the english dub as the subtitles. It hasn't turned me away from the blurays, they are really great quality, but it is a little bit obnoxious."
ghibli,3d9tyx,Kolop,2,Tue Jul 14 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Japanese audio isn't considered a dub because it's the original audio. Perhaps that's where the confusion is coming from?    To insert a new soundtrack, often a synchronized translation of the original dialogue, into (a film).   The Free Dictionary"
ghibli,3d9tyx,solstice_of_light,2,Wed Jul 15 06:56:43 2015 UTC,Japanese soundtracks are available on all Studio Ghibli DVDs and BDs. You can buy Disney's releases with confidence.
ghibli,3d7lk1,raechae4,3,Tue Jul 14 03:31:35 2015 UTC,Take a screenshot from the Blu-ray and have it printed on a site like Shortrun posters.

ghibli,3d49mc,Ewandowski,5,Mon Jul 13 12:05:04 2015 UTC,My normal edition came. Emotionally overwhelming film.
ghibli,3d49mc,FaerieStories,3,Mon Jul 13 20:48:38 2015 UTC,Mine was packed pretty tightly with the post cards in it.
ghibli,3d49mc,Hash_brown,3,Mon Jul 13 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, I think I'm going to leave them in but if I decide to rewatch this often in the future I may remove them."
ghibli,3d49mc,Kevinik,4,Mon Jul 13 21:09:08 2015 UTC,Where can I get this?  Edit: Nevermind I got it at UK Amazon. But I read it's Region B . And I don't know if it's playable in Region A too.
ghibli,3d49mc,TalesOfFan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:28:47 2015 UTC,"It's likely not playable on a Region A player. I have a bunch of Studio Canal Ghibli releases, and all of them are Region B only."
ghibli,3d49mc,Moonhowler22,3,Tue Jul 14 05:43:02 2015 UTC,That's really nice.
ghibli,3d49mc,BermudaCake,2,Mon Jul 13 17:39:19 2015 UTC,This may be the nicest Collector's Edition of any DVD/Blu-ray I own. I can't say much about the film as I haven't seen it yet but I plan on watching it tonight :)
ghibli,3d49mc,xRIOSxx,4,Mon Jul 13 12:06:10 2015 UTC,You won't be disappointed! Pretty much every frame of Kaguya could be stuck in a frame.
ghibli,3d49mc,iMattxC,4,Mon Jul 13 17:43:26 2015 UTC,Enjoy! Its my favorite ghibli movie. Might have to get this.
ghibli,3d49mc,TalesOfFan,2,Mon Jul 13 19:38:36 2015 UTC,It's so good
ghibli,3d49mc,posananer,2,Mon Jul 13 23:19:09 2015 UTC,Very nice. Maybe I should have sprung for Studio Canal's release. GKids didn't put out a special edition. :(
ghibli,3d4zt1,Noxate,6,Mon Jul 13 15:55:46 2015 UTC,"Miyazaki said he is currently working with computer graphics staff on a short animated film to be shown at his museum in Mitaka, western Tokyo. The main character of the film is a small hairy caterpillar living on a small green leaf."
ghibli,3d4zt1,susrev,2,Mon Jul 13 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the film he was going to make before he got talked into doing Princess Mononoke (I think it was Mononoke, anyway)"
ghibli,3d6crr,Nin10dork99,2,Mon Jul 13 21:40:28 2015 UTC,Disney doesn't own the rights to all the movies in the US. So a complete collection is impossible.
ghibli,3d6crr,Shigofumi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"Would you think that eventually, somebody would release one?"
ghibli,3d6crr,Shigofumi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:07:37 2015 UTC,"Each company knows Ghibli is a goldmine, their not going to relinquish their rights unless the company somehow goes bankrupt."
ghibli,3d6crr,Shigofumi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"Well, that would explain why we haven't gotten one yet. I would import but the prices are over $800."
ghibli,3d6crr,ghibliblog,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:29:09 2015 UTC,Most Japanese people don't buy home-video releases so the prices have to be jacked up so the companies can make a profit off the few people that do. We'd be in the same boat if they US wasn't such a heavy BD/DVD buying culture.
ghibli,3d6crr,romerz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:41:25 2015 UTC,"It's not likely to happen. It's too bad, because the movies on the box set were given new digital remasters, and in the case of Nausicaa, are improved over previous releases. There are just too many copyrights issues, as well as Disney's reluctance (they can't sell Ghibli toys, so there's no money in it for them)."
ghibli,3d6crr,Kolop,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"I would assume that it'd happen someday, but I'm worried it'll take years. That's fine, maybe someday I'll import it..."

ghibli,3d2q45,subflax,9,Tue Jul 14 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"Bioworld is a popular manufacturer of ""pop"" items (they make a lot of mario and other videogame things). Hot Topic has had Kiki and Totoro things for around 6 months now. I was told then that the next additions would be Spirited Away and Laputa (MY FAV), so I'm hoping this is what's happening! Also they actually have really good deals online and very nice shipping, so see what you want in store, then buy it online!  WARNING: Do not go in with more money than you want to spend! I made that mistake... I have almost everything in those pictures minus the No-Face plush.. :D"

By buying from Hot Topic your money actually supports Studio Ghibi instead of some leech on Etsy or random ""nerd"" t-shirt site."
ghibli,3d2q45,Brownski,3,Mon Jul 13 11:42:36 2015 UTC,I bought my fiance the totoro sweats a while ago and he wears them almost every night. I hope they come out with more.

ghibli,3d5qmm,Kolop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:35:34 2015 UTC,Just finished watching this for the first time and now I'm even more sad that this has never been released in the US. I really hope this gets a US Blu-ray release one day.  Does Disney still own the rights to this?  I wonder if GKids would ever be interested in releasing this. Ocean Waves as well.
