They are way more docile when sleepy because when they are sleepy, in their minds:  amount of effort required to wake up and react to annoyance > annoyance.  So I usually clip their nails while they're sleeping.   Also, it varies from cat to cat. They really have different personalities. My bigger/older cat won't put up with any shit but the kitty in this picture sometimes enjoys being picked up and snuggled and stuff like that. I didn't really wrap him up like a burrito in this picture. He was already lying down on top of the blanket and I just pulled it on top of him and tucked him in. :)"

tuckedinkitties,3a5r54,Chevellephreak,5,Wed Jun 17 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"My cat loves to jump up on the mattress while I'm trying to put the fitted sheet on. Finally, one day I just fastened down the sheet with him underneath. He flattened out for a moment and then began squirming like mad trying to find a way out. I was a horrible person and just stood there chortling the whole time. He kinda learnt - he still jumps up, but now takes off after the first three corners are tucked."
tuckedinkitties,3a5r54,LadyVimes,4,Wed Jun 17 17:21:48 2015 UTC,I do this every time. She still does it! Her favourite sleeping spot is on the tote that the linens are in so she knows right when the damned sheets are going to be changed!

She will yowl at us until someone picks her up and lets her drink out of the faucet. Most of her time is spent laying on my dads stomach."

Older cats are so extra cuddly and seem to really grow into their personalities, it's so wonderful to see (my other boy is 15).  Bournville (19) has his bit of the sofa with a fleece but he spends most of his day under my duvet. Coco has a padded bed on an ottoman by the window, there's a gap where heat from the radiator comes up so he has underfloor heating."

Maybe you could do something similar?"
tuckedinkitties,2z0vo5,feralstank,9,Sat Mar 14 18:06:40 2015 UTC,I actually was looking into setting up AutoModerator for just that reason. Why target cat subreddits? This is so strange.

tuckedinkitties,2xjjol,MsStardust,20,Sun Mar 1 07:10:22 2015 UTC,"I covered him up, and he stayed snuggled next to me like this for several hours. Poor little dude.  Update: We took him to the ER this morning. His fever was quite high, so they gave him sub q fluids, and ran blood work and did X-rays, which both came back negative. However, his fever is even higher, so they are going to give him antibiotics and IV fluids, and keep him overnight. Hoping for the best, but I'm worried.   Update 2: I just called and talked to my cat's vet tech. He's getting IV fluids and antibiotics, and seems to have perked up a little. He's purring, and they got him to eat (he had not eaten since Friday night, so for about 42 hours). At one point, his fever was up to 106.1°F. It's now down to 105.3°, but that is still very high (normal for cats is ~101.5°), so we just have to wait and hope the fluids help.   Update 3: They did an ultrasound this morning and found nothing, so they put him on another antibiotic and an antiviral. As of this evening, my kitty still has a fever, but it's down to 104.3, and he's eating like a champ, so we get to bring him home! We're on the way to get him now. :-) Also, thank you so much for the gold! What an unexpected and nice surprise to find when I logged into reddit.   Update 4: After charming all the hospital staff (the vet tech said she wished she could keep him), our little guy is home, and sporting a stylish new haircut! He's still not feeling well, but his appetite has come back, and he's being good about all the meds I have to give him. We'll be watching him closely over the next few days, and he follows up with our regular vet on Thursday morning. Thank you all so much for your concern!"

tuckedinkitties,2x2bp3,Panic_Mechanic,2,Wed Feb 25 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"Not really, they might if they haven't had a bath in a while, but it's more like some dandruff than grease. They really aren't that hard to take care of. They need a bath every couple weeks as well as claw clipping and ear cleaning, all of which are really easy and pretty fast. Most sphynx grow up getting used to those things so they don't really put up a fight. I highly recommend getting a sphynx!"
tuckedinkitties,2x2bp3,Thespomat27,2,Thu Feb 26 08:04:06 2015 UTC,"Bathing them every two weeks sounds like it cuts down on that potential greasiness.

One of my cats died on 1-23-15 and it was a very very sad thing to have him gone. We were all stunned and devastated. We still are. I find myself thinking of him and start crying at least once a day.  A few days after legend died, I happened upon a kitten that really needed a home. He's 5 months old and not in perfect health so I took him to my vet to see if it was even possible to rescue him and bring him into my home. I don't want my other two cats to get sick. But the vet gave me a few rx and the all clear that he won't infect his new brothers.   Spartacus has given us all something to be happy about again. something to look forward to and smile about, rather than look back and mourn over and over. I will never forget legend and will always have him in my heart. I just wish they could have met.   Sort for the wall of text. I just want to get this out. It's rather therapeutic.  TL;DR one cat died, I was sad. Rescued a non perfect cat, we are healing."

Her face coloring is pretty neat- she has a perfect split down the middle of her mouth that runs down to the top of her chest. Her whiskers are white on the tan side of her face, and black on the black side of her face. Maybe that's common? I think it's interesting at least. I got a couple pretty good shots of her when she was dressed up all fancy on Christmas and one closer up. And since this OP loves to deliver, here's a bonus one of her poking her head out from the reddit Kitnipbox we ordered over the holidays. Do you have any kitties?

So one day it was getting late and we were gonna put the cats away for her. Suddenly we noticed one was missing. We panicked and thought it got into the rest of the house (the worry with the rest of the house is we have a dog that plays rough and unless the cat hits him back a few times, he will put his mouth around the cats neck.
