VPN,3e1cro,jjolla888,2,Tue Jul 21 11:37:04 2015 UTC,"In the case of a DNS leak, it still goes through the tunnel.  The concern with DNS leaks is with more advanced threats than public wifi use.  On a VPN network that is utilizing shared IPs for privacy, all of the DNS requests come from the same IP address and go to the same DNS servers. This is the same mechanism for privacy that regular VPN traffic uses as well. The concern is that if someone were watching at somewhere like the VPN's datacenter's edge, and the DNS is leaking, your traffic sticks out from everyone else, because the DNS server that the VPN traffic is going to is unique.  It is still going through the tunnel, and is still encrypted."

At those speeds the processor in your devices is also a concern.  You will probably want to host your own VPS in a datacenter very close to you for optimal performance, but you lose the privacy benefits of IP sharing in that case.  There aren't a lot of very good VPN solutions for 300 Mbit+ connections."
VPN,3dihy8,Youknowimtheman,2,Thu Jul 16 16:47:50 2015 UTC,So the trade-off isn't really worth it then? If I'm supposed to be getting 1000 Mbps then with a VPN  I would be at 200 Mbps then. That's still pretty good unless I'm not considering some other important factors. My main thing is to keep my privacy while also getting bang for buck. I currently pay $70 ish a month for 45 Mbps so that price for 200 Mbps sounds good although I would probably factor in the price of the VPN.

You can reserve up to 20 ports, that will not get changed on you. You can connect to up to three different servers, and each gets the 20 ports forwarded.  Very good speeds.  The OpenVPN client that comes with any Linux distribution should work fine. But they do have a GUI client to wrap around the underlying OpenVPN client. Its own more up to date copy, not the distribution one, I believe. It seems to be very popular with their customers. But I just build the OpenVPN client from source myself. Easy to do on Linux."

You need a good processor for that. ASUS RT-N66U has a great processor, Linksys E3000 doesn't handle SSL very well. In terms of speed between the two, because the Asus has a better processor, it can handle the bandwidth speed a lot better, more speed. The Linksys struggles and your download is much slower than without your router being on the VPN. Your computer can handle SSL quite well nowadays. Most people are better of using a VPN on their own computer for faster speeds, unless they have a router that can handle it. You need a really good router to handle multiple devices to get even better speeds for all of them. Sure there's overhead, but you also need decent equipment."

VPN,3ddcs6,Youknowimtheman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, it could very well be another issue (ie as others suggested, your ISP slowing down your connection to the VPN sites themselves, china-specific filtering issues, etc) instead of  simply inadequate VPN bandwidth.   Have you looked into BlackVPN?  I've never used them, but if I recall they are headquartered in Hong Kong, so they  may have some advice for this very issue? However, it is somewhat worrisome that they don't advertise servers in HK itself, though    HideMe is out of Malaysia, maybe they're helpful likewise (and they do have a HK server listed)  I'd also consider speaking with AirVPN and Proxy.sh again, as both of them  are supposed to have some serious hardware (no bandwidth limits) and a variety of servers, including in Hong Kong (Proxy.sh has servers in China itself, as well as Hong Kong).  Proxy.sh also allows you to  nest/obfuscate VPNs if I recall (ie VPN into one of their servers in China, then pick another VPN outside to obfuscate etc).   In my experience, the Proxy.sh crew has been pretty well informed and willing to talk at length (they will escalate your posts for a manager or exec if you have in depth questions).   Also, if money is really no object, Proxy.sh has an option on their pricing page for custom solutions so you can work out exactly what you need.           Good luck!   Edit:   No personal experience here, but if nothing else works and it seems the issue is filtering related, check out CryptoStorm . They are far from ""popular"", use latest technologies, and have a community which may have  some ideas. The only downside is that they don't have the spread of servers that many others do, but its still worth keeping your eyes open."

VPN,3d9a8i,Amplige,4,Tue Jul 14 15:45:34 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with the sentiment from others here. OP, if you understand that a VPN is a tool to help maintain privacy (and anonymity to a certain degree) of the end users, why would you require such detailed information from those you interview? There is a disconnect here I think you will have to reconcile before moving forward with these interviews.  I myself have an academic background in conducting qualitative research and mid-sized ethnographies and I not once was required to get any invasive details on the study participants if they chose not to provide them.  Just out of curiosity, why do you require all of those details? If it is to gather a demographic of the people you are looking at you can add a small layer of anonymity by perhaps asking someone their age range (E.g. Age 25-34) or perhaps their occupation type (E.g. Retail) rather than the specifics of these."

Is there any possibility you can present this thread to your professor or perhaps have a brief meeting outlining the concerns raised here? Is it possible that your professor is unaware of what a VPN is/does/promotes?  It strikes me as very strange that a journalism instructor will not accept anonymous sources. Is that not one of the core pillars of journalism? That a journalist has a right to protect their sources? For an article on an anonymizing service it is extremely bizarre a professor would not allow for anonymous sources.  If there is a concern about you perhaps fudging the data and/or merely fabricating VPN user interviews, perhaps you can find a happy medium with your professor? For example a real time, private chat via CryptoCat or another anonymous centric messaging system that the professor could watch? Just throwing ideas out here as I think you will have an incredibly uphill battle convincing practically anyone on this thread of giving up such personal data to a complete stranger."
VPN,3d9a8i,alargecat,2,Tue Jul 14 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"I'm at a journalism summer program at Northwestern for rising high school seniors. My instructor recently graduated and (in my view) seems kind of lost- bad critiques of work, etc. For this assignment, we are required to have named sources, and I had a hard time convincing her to let me write about the rise of VPNs in the first place.  I'll try to find some students on campus instead. Thanks!"
VPN,3d9a8i,merkinj,2,Tue Jul 14 19:03:46 2015 UTC,"Best of luck. That is a shame your instructor has such a narrow minded approach to this potentially interesting article you could write. My only recommendation that I can offer going forward is make sure that when interviewing anyone explicitly tell them:   They have no presumption of anonymity/confidentiality. This disclosure is a must in all research. Make it fully known before anyone talks to you about these issues that they will be named and have other information gathered. This is the only ethical way to go about this type of research. If it is an absolute must that they be fully named, I would encourage you to tell respondents to not discuss illegal activities. While there is a thin line between coercing and protecting respondents here, this is something I would do in your situation. Encourage them to perhaps discuss issues in the broader picture or abstract sense so as not to implicate themselves in any potentially illegal activity."
VPN,3d9a8i,traveler19395,5,Tue Jul 14 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight. Your wanting to talk with people to collect opinions on why people who are privacy oriented use a specific type of  service that helps keep someone anonymous . You then reference Mr. Snowden and the prism program he brought to light , which is fairly effective. While at the same time we are to trust you that you are who you say you are. Then to top it off you want to us users to give you profoundly identifying information to you? I  think you might want to take some more rudimentary classes on how to conduct an interview."

I forgot to mention that VPN clients are not used because I use the VPN from a pfSense router to protect my entire network.  Furthermore, as mentioned by @bad_as_the_dickens, VPN clients just disable IPv6 on the computer but do not provide an IPv6 connection (either native or tunnel).  Since my ISP does provide a native IPv6 connection, I have to manually disable IPv6 on the router so it doesn't leak.  I'm still searching for a VPN service that provides both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  I find IPv6 much faster to resolve DNS queries so I'd prefer to use it whenever a VPN provider enables it. Plus there's the added benefit that Port Forwarding, UPnP and NAT-PMP are no longer needed since all devices get a public IPv6 address."

VPN,3cu9ry,q00p,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue as you. Come to find out, PeerBlock was blocking the connection. Once Peerblock was disabled, connection was possible.  While you may not have PeerBlock, there may be another program that could be blocking the connection whether it be a firewall setting or an antivirus that blocks suspicious IP's or another program that blocks certain IP's like PeerGuardian or MoBlock. Even the Windows Host file could block certain IP's as well. Just because you had issues with the software doesn't mean the software has issues itself.  I am curious. Did both the Client and OpenVPN software fail to connect? If it was one OR the other, that sounds like an installation issue. If it was both, then I would think that something is blocking the connection for one reason or another.   Edit: PeerBlock updated its IP range which is why it had worked before that time. After the update, it took me several hours to figure it out. So while it worked before, through no action on my part, the connection was failing. And so while no action on your part, maybe something updated and then caused the connection issue."

It's really good that you are informing yourself.    Is it particularly useful to pick a VPN service whose headquarters are not based in one of the Five Eyes countries?    As a general rule, yes, but even those countries can offer protections e.g. the US's no logging and free speech laws. That said it is still recommended to choose a service with servers and HQ outside of those countries.    Are there any other countries that should raise a red flag for me?   Russia, China and the U.K would be some I would avoid. They are not known for their privacy laws.    Should I be considering a VPN that has servers based in certain countries?   Some countries offer better protections than others but choose a service that has multiple server locations so you can choose yourself.    What technical things should I be looking out for? I've heard of OpenVPN but I don't really know what it is. Apparently it's important.   OpenVPN is widely considered the most secure way to use a VPN. Stick with this option!    What exactly is a seedbox and is that worth having along with a VPN?   A seedbox is not related to VPN's. They are servers which are used to download files using the P2P protocol. People who use a seedbox typically connect to it using a VPN as an extra layer of protection when downloading files from the seedbox to their computer.    Anything else I should consider along with a VPN?   Not really. Get used to using a VPN first. Once you are connected use a service like ipleak to check you are fully secure and not leaking your DNS, IP etc.    Any VPN providers I should actively avoid? Anything scandalous I should know about?   Stick to those mentioned in Torrentfreaks list and you should be fine. Hope this helps.   p.s Someone must be shadowbanned in this post."

Speed is dependent on a few things and generally speaking you will lose some when using a VPN. Some factors to consider are, what type of servers is the VPN provider using, whether or not they are gigabyte capable and their relative location to where you are i.e. the closer you are to the server the less speed you will lose.

So let's say I'm in China and I want to know the ping to TorGuard how does knowing your ping help me? Your site says that it's pinging from multiple locations. So does that mean your averaging the pings? If so what is the purpose? Since most of the providers have 30+ VPN servers, I'd like to see a ping for each one with information on where the ping originated from. The same goes for the download speeds, it would be nice to know the download speeds for each server and not just an average since the speeds can vary greatly.  I'd suggest you add a feature that allows users to enter their location on your site and get ping information based off that."

The Ping model works as follows:- One nodes lives in Texas, it connects to torguard that has a server in London, it then Pings the closest Public Ping server (usually a DNS), is this not useful information to determine weather one of the torguard servers is faster/responsive than another? Are you saying you want to know the ping to the vpn server before dialing? if you think that this is important information that would benefit the site then I could certainly implement that. Unless I have completely misunderstood you in which case please elaborate.  One of my main concerns is would you YOU the user pay for all what you asked for for a low monthly price or should I apply Advertisements on the site to help pay and display more detailed results. The individual results does make sense for the intermediate VPN user."

A proper VPN service (check the sidebar, and be extremely suspicious of anything free) will route your data to their servers, and out to the open 'net from an IP address belonging to them.  A good VPN is reliable and safe for keeping your data private from your ISP (ex. Comcast), for protecting you on open wifi (ex. Starbucks). By extension of keeping your data from your ISP, they will not receive copyright notices if you are downloading torrents, those notices will go to the VPN company, and most will not give up your identity.  VPNs are not for hiding from the NSA, unless it's just one part in a much more technical and elaborate strategy."

VPN,3c2f6o,Astramancer_,5,Sat Jul 4 03:26:13 2015 UTC,"In very basic terms, an IP address is easy to explain what it is.  It's, well, an address.  If you're browsing a website, you find out their address (changed from ""reddit.com"" to whatever the appropriate ip address is by a domain name server) and send them a letter (a packet, in computer terms).  They get your letter asking for a copy of the front page, and they send it back to the return address (your IP address).  The problem is that your ISP has to know where the letter is going in order to get it there in the first place.  The letter can be encrypted (https), which makes it so that your ISP can't read it, but they still know where it's going.  They also generally know what kind of letter it is, because of where they're going/coming from -- they know if it's a post card or a package containing torrent data, or voice coms or whatever.  If it's not encrypted, they can do a deep packet inspection and know exactly what it is.  You can also deliberately send a letter with a wrong return address, but you won't get the response, the wrong return address will.    Now what VPNs do is that you send them encrypted letters.  Their servers then decrypt your letter and pass it along to your original destination with their address as the return address.  So reddit sees traffic from PrivateVPN and sends the response there.  The VPN servers then take those responses (which may already be encrypted) and encrypt it themselves and send it to you.  So your ISP is only passing encrypted traffic between you and the VPN.  That's all they see.  The VPN is passing encrypted traffic between you and the website.  So the website doesn't know where you are, and your ISP doesn't know who you're talking to.  At this point, only the VPN knows both where you are (your real IP address) and who you're talking to.  This is why it's so important to choose a legit VPN.  But keep in mind that if someone really wants to know who you've been talking to (web-wise), and they have a legal right to that information, they can get a court order to have the VPN hand over their logs.  You can make this process harder by choosing a VPN based outside of your country, but that's generally going to result in less responsive service (since the packets have to travel halfway around the world, possibly twice if the service you're hitting up is in your country).  You can also add additional layers by connecting through multiple VPNs, but that can get pricy and, again, will increase the amount of time it takes to get packets from you to where you want them to go."

VPN,3bz6j5,emptyset404,12,Sun Jul 5 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"In this thread: terrible advice!   I just purchased torgaurd vpn service.   If you used a form of payment that is linked back to your identity, you have failed.  Since this is part of your chain, you have ""poisoned the well"" so to speak.   Step One: VPN on Host    Is your host Windows? What steps have you taken to ensure all traffic actually goes through your VPN? What have you done about DNS leaks? Are you connecting through an ISP that you paid for, linked to your actual identity? Does your VPN provider log (yes, yes they do)?    Step Two: Launch VM    Is your VM configured to route all traffic properly through the VPN tunnel, including DNS? Is your VM operating system Windows? Have you disabled all non-essential services running inside the VM? Is there absolutely anything in the VM that could be used to link back to your identity (or, a flaw in the VM software that could be exploited to gain information about your host operating system (which is linked to you).    Step Three: Launch Tor (assuming from inside VM)    Have you disabled scripts in Tor browser? Are the services you are connecting to logging your access? Are you connecting to any services that can be linked back to your actual identity?    Step Four: Launch VPN from VM   Actually, if your VPN account was paid for through a method that links to your actual identity, what you've just done is negated the anonymity offered by Tor.  This is because somebody with NSA-level resources can now correlate your incoming and outgoing connections into the Tor network from the same VPN provider.   What do you all suggest I do for complete anonymity?   Few people need total anonymity.  The NSA does not care about your porn or torrents.  If you want to hide your porn, pay for a VPN.  If you want to hide your torrents from copyright trolls, pay for a VPN in another jurisdiction.  After this reality check, if you decide you don't really need this level of anonymity, consider paying it forward with a small donation to the Tor or Tails projects.  You're already paying for a VPN, throw a couple of dollars at them.  The types of people that actually need the following level of anonymity are:   Journalists working in dangerous countries Low-profile human rights activists in dangerous countries Low-profile dissidents of the State   I say low-profile, because high-profile activists are under active vs. passive scrutiny, so the low-profile activist is defending against passive identification.  For the same reason, high-profile journalists should probably act as if under active scrutiny.  Caveat Emptor:   Use Tails on read-only media and verify the GPG signature In a high-risk country, connect to a Tor bridge Use a computer manufactured pre-2001 and remove the hard-drive If you must take the risk to physically store media, use a fully encrypted removable drive (or transfer files out via Onionshare, or Tahoe-LAFS) Do not connect through the ISP you are paying for Instead of a VPN, consider a jump box in a different legal jurisdiction that you can pay for with untraceable funds, where you can actually disable services, logging Never access services linked back to your identity (e.g. Facebook) Assume all services you access are recording every interaction you make, so change your behavior accordingly: do not describe where you live, do not describe the weather, do not access the service at the same time every day, do not use your freakin' handle   Good luck, and stay safe.

VPN,3bz6j5,dewbiestep,2,Fri Jul 3 15:56:30 2015 UTC,"The NSA level resources have already:   Put the VPN providers ""on the payroll"" if you will, and they willingly submit or provide access to logging information For those VPN providers that have resisted, where possible the NSA simply breaks into their systems and performs the logging themselves The NSA has also broken some of the cryptography used by some VPN providers, so that traffic encrypted on those connections appears as cleartext to them   Bitcoin payments are still a transaction that occurs over the internet, so it can be traced just like any other data packets.  So just take care when performing those transactions: use Tails via a connection that is not your ISP to purchase Bitcoins, and spend them in the same way.  Again, this all depends on what you need to defend against.  Anonymity is hard and not convenient.  If there is a step that feels easy, then it's very likely because you're doing it wrong.  This is why I favor purchasing a cheap VPS with Bitcoin to use as a jumpbox and controlling (for most) variables.  You can install and customize an image on a VPS to suit: disabled services, disabled logging, encrypted partitions.  And yet it's still not bulletproof!  We're still talking about hardware that is not physically in your control.  Unless you have a way to check every single time, who is to say your ""set it and forget it"" personal VPN wasn't swapped out for an image hosting the same software and configuration?  To mitigate that, every time you connect, you could purchase a new instance, setup the jumpbox from an image, and connect.  If you purchase from the same provider, that can establish a pattern but using multiple providers make it difficult to automate.  This is also expensive.  Trade-offs.  As to whether or not you've failed - it really depends on your threat model.  It is highly unlikely that anyone posting on Reddit asking for this information actually needs protection from the NSA.  That said, I'm all for not making their job easier as a form of civil protest.  :)  The most likely and damaging threat to most Internet users are copyright trolls (even for people that aren't torrenting!) - and a VPN or seedbox in a different legal jurisdiction is enough to mitigate that risk.  Pay for it in Bitcoin if you're extra paranoid.  You'll be fine."

VPN,3bz6j5,sohoodnerd,2,Fri Jul 3 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"VPN > Whonix in VM > ???? > Profit  My understanding is Whonix is like 2 iso VM, one is the operating system you use, the other acts as a virtual router to encrypt all connections through Tor.  So let's say you get a virus that fucks up Tor or enables Javascript or whatever in your VM OS.  Doesn't matter, your traffic is encrypted in a layer outside of the OS.  As a matter of fact you don't even need to run Tor in the VM OS, you can use a normal browser and go full dummy on the virus downloads. So in the end maybe it's like:   VM OS > Whonix Tor > VPN on main OS > Your Router  But if you were REALLY serious about security, perhaps you'd build/buy one of those physical boxes that connect to your router that encrypt with Computer > Tor box > Your Router.  That shit is way outsite of my level of expertise so ask someone else about the details.  Or someone else will comment that if you were serious you'd burn Tails on a DVD. It leaves no traces,  but then again Tor is only one layer, so what if Tor is cracked?"

So stick with Whonix's build of TBB."

VPN,3bz6j5,ThizzWalifa,2,Fri Jul 3 21:42:52 2015 UTC,Inside TOR browser there is an option to run transparently where the browser doesn't connect to TOR. TOR option is there for the purpose of those who run a TOR router. By default this option is enabled in Whonix. On top of this it is set to a specific port for the browser. This means the browser will use different circuits than your other apps. Whonix has ports dedicated for specific apps of those included and those not. This way you can make sure your chat app has a different IP from a Bitcoin wallet as they are set to different designated ports.  Whonix comes with its own built in version of TOR Browser bundle which I believe is optimized to run in Whonix. And so yes to answer your questions it isn't double TORified.
VPN,3bz6j5,ThizzWalifa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Your better off with VPN > VPN > TOR than VPN > TOR > VPN. The reason for this is that running a VPN through TOR disrupts TOR's ability to use stream isolation and distrusts TOR's ability to continually change circuits to protect your anonymity by making a Sybil attack less likely. By running a VPN though TOR your IP stays static. With TOR on the tail end your IP is constantly changing. Also if you ever once use that VPN from a no  TOR IP connecting  to the VPN then you fucked your privacy because if that VPN was used in your real IP and it did log then it has your real IP attached to it and if used though TOR it would be entirely ineffective because it already knows who you are. A VPN on the tail end is only something that should be used if you must evade a TOR band (site blocks TOR) if not a VPN after TOR should be avoided at all costs. In the event that it must be used that VPN must be entirely isolated to TOR, it must be signed up for through TOR and sandboxes to TOR and payed for anonymously through TOR so that the VPN never sees a non TOR IP."

VPN,3bk5k5,greatestape,14,Mon Jun 29 21:51:59 2015 UTC,"From what I gather in your post, your threat model essentially rests on you trying to avoid detection from your ISP and subsequently copyright holders.  A threat model is important to consider. If one is trying to achieve full anonymity and confidentiality from the likes of the NSA, then a VPN alone is not enough.  I would highly recommend a VPN in your case, however. I won't go into specifics as to which provider, but a quick search of this sub can reveal quite a few providers who are up to scratch.  There is of course a level of trust you have to place in the VPN provider itself that it is adhering to it's claim of ""no logs"". There have been a few high profile cases where VPN providers tracked users after claiming no logs were being kept. In my case however, I have not experienced any issues with my provider logging me (that I am aware of) and/or forwarding along DMCA complaints to me (for what it's worth).  Many of these no log VPN providers that allow P2P would merely ask you to avoid using servers in specific locations (E.g. USA) so as to avoid any problems with their data center providers in that respective country.  Above all, a very easy mistake to make when utilizing a VPN for P2P purposes is not ensuring that DNS leaks are neutralized. Without going into a great level of detail, you can achieve this with many of the VPN providers' proprietary software where it is a mere check box that needs to be checked. Usually you will see a setting that makes note of ""Stop DNS Leaks"" or something along those lines. An easy way to check if your DNS leaks have stopped is to go to DNS Leak Test and run it through an extended test. You should see only the DNS settings of your VPN provider here if it is configured correctly.  I am by no means an expert on VPNs, but I hope this helps steer you in the right direction."
VPN,3bk5k5,Amplige,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:24:17 2015 UTC,"Hello, I just purchased my very first VPN. Specifically AirVPN. I'm very illiterate with this kind of stuff so I have no idea what all the settings I need to tinker with. But I turned on Network Lock, and I connected to a server in Canada. I also ran that DNS leak test you linked and it only pulled up the VPN's ip address and the location in Canada. Even in the extended test. So does that mean I'm good? And is that it? I can torrent away safely? I don't have to worry about anything?"

VPN,3bk5k5,Stannaz99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:57 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  /u/Stannaz99 summed it up quite nicely. The integrated Network Lock is a very key tool (which I also should have mentioned in my initial post) as it prevents your real IP from leaking in the event the VPN server goes down. This can be fatal in terms of torrenting anonymously.  I am not entirely familiar with AirVPN's policies on P2P on Canadian servers, but my guess is that if you successfully connected to a torrent swarm on an AirVPN Canadian server, you should be allowed.  If you have tested your DNS servers on DNS Leak Test, and it only resolves to the VPN server's DNS settings, my guess is you would be good to go with the settings you outlined.  My only other suggestion (and others may say it is overkill in this situation) is, if you are using FireFox, and wish to ensure your VPN connection is secure when downloading the initial .torrent file from a website, you may wish to disable a browser function called WebRTC. For more information please check out PrivacyTools.io  From the site:   WebRTC is a new communication protocol that relies on JavaScript that can leak your actual IP address from behind your VPN.  How to disable WebRTC in Firefox?  In short: Set ""media.peerconnection.enabled"" to ""false"" in ""about:config"".   Explained:  Enter ""about:config"" in the firefox address bar and press enter. Press the button ""I'll be careful, I promise!"" Search for ""media.peerconnection.enabled"" Double click the entry, the column ""Value"" should now be ""false"" Done. Do the WebRTC leak test again.   The leak test for this particular function can be found here.  This is mainly geared toward users using a VPN to surf the web anonymously too, but it is never a bad idea to use all the security tips you can."

I'm just curious because he's having me mess with things like changing ports, Enable uPnP port mapping, Global Maximum Number of Connections, Protocol Encryption, and I have no idea what that means. Just wanted to make sure it's not going to mess with my security or efficiency of my VPN."
VPN,3bk5k5,AppleShampoo102,2,Thu Jul 9 01:41:36 2015 UTC,"To be absolutely safe, simply have network lock always activated.  You should have protocol encryption disabled as it is not required, since the VPN does the hiding of packets for you. UPnP should not be enabled, either.   I personally have always run a torrent client with entirely closed ports and encountered no issues, and I would recommend this unless somebody else has other views on this. In the case you would like to have an open port for incoming connections, you should use AirVPNs port forwarding, which all goes through the VPN.  Doing all of his recommendations, minus protocol encryption and UPnP and possibly ignoring the ports, should increase the efficiency of everything, while maintaining the overall security.   My personal recommendation would be to scrap uTorrent, and move to qBittorrent. The GUI is similar, and you should have no issues with understanding it. qBittorrent is open source, and runs much much more efficiently than uTorrent - although it's not a problem if you would like to stay with uTorrent.   As usual, do not hesitate to ask me any questions."
VPN,3bk5k5,Stannaz99,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the quick reply! I really appreciate it! I took your advice and switched to qBittorrent. :)   Alright, so I went to Connection, I unchecked ""Use UPnP/NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router"". Then I went to BitTorrent, and set ""Encryption mode:"" to disable encryption. That's what I was supposed to do, correct? After that I think the only other think in that guide was to change the disk cache to 1800. So do I just go under ""Advanced"", and then at the very top one that says ""Disk write cache size"" change it from auto to 1800? Then that's it? Is there anything else I should do in qBittorrent to make things faster? Once again, thank you so much for all the help. I do not take it for granted. I GREATLY appreciate it."

Also, I've noticed while using AirVPN that my internet speed slows down greatly. Just to be sure I did an online test, the results were while using AirVPN I get 4.63 Mbps download speed, then when I turn AirVPN off and do the test again I get 13.60 Mbps download speed. Why is that? I've been told a good VPN shouldn't slow down my internet at all. Is there anything I can do to fix this?"
VPN,3bk5k5,AppleShampoo102,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:29:07 2015 UTC,"You should not have a slowdown of that large. Unfortunately I may have to disappoint you on this one since I have many computers and different setups with VPNs, yet I have no clue why seemingly random setups go excessively slow.  My advice would be to go to AirVPNs forums for assistance for from other users. If you feel like doing something yourself then my only suggestions is trying other protocols/ports and changing the buffer size, seems like it works sometimes but hasn't personally helped me out much. A quick Google should bring up how to change buffers - I'm on my phone right now and don't have time to type it out. If you have difficulty, then just let me know as I'll likely be on my desktop next time.  Best of luck on this one.  Note: There's a way to change buffers in the AirVPN client, so include ""AirVPN"" in the query.  EDIT: I forgot about the torrent clients; change the connection amount settings at minimum and you should be okay. I personally use 500 per torrent and 1500 in total, although I would recommend 1000 total for you as you are on a ~12mbps line.  EDIT 2: Found it for you; https://airvpn.org/topic/14401-calling-for-tests/ - They give a list of values to try, try them all with a reconnect in between and see how the speedtest goes, try different combinations with the buffers and protocols/ports too."
VPN,3bk5k5,Stannaz99,7,Thu Jul 9 06:52:29 2015 UTC,"If you use a VPN you are not untraceable. At a minimum your VPN service provider can trace you. If the FBI needed to find you it is likely that they could force your VPN provider to co-operate with them. That said, the FBI is not going to do this for a P2P file sharing complaint.

The only way a media content owner could find you is if they contacted the VPN provider and that VPN provider handed over your information. Which most of them would never do.  edit: Also... a lot of VPN providers don't keep logs so they wouldn't even be able to tell the media content owner which customer it was. They would have to be tracing the communication in real time and since they aren't legally required to comply with request from a media content owner there isn't a chance in hell they would do that."
VPN,3bk5k5,Amplige,3,Tue Jun 30 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Using a properly configured VPN, the chances of Vobile identifying you again are extremely slim to nil.  The legal loops that a private company such as Vobile would need to hop through to identify you would be great in number. Whereas without a VPN you IP address is in plain sight in a torrent swarm (where they could easily identify your ISP and request an infringement notice be sent to you personally) a VPN hides your real IP leaving Vobile only seeing the IP of the VPN.  Vobile at this point would need to find a way to legally compel the VPN provider to identify you (normally through originating IP) then once again send along a notice to your ISP once they have received that information. If the VPN is incorporated outside of Canada I would assume (not a lawyer) there would be a great amount of legal work necessary to force an uncooperative VPN provider to start logging to help identify you.  TL;DR - For what you are using the VPN for, the time and expense necessary to identify you would far outpace the monetary wins any company could win from you in a Canadian court. You would need to be an egregious pirate for this to be worth legal action against a VPN."

Prior to the start of this year ISPs in Canada were not legally obligated to forward along infringement notices sent to them from copyright holders. Some ISPs did while others did not.  At the start of this year ISPs became obligated by law to forward along infringment notices.  While these notices cannot demand payment (to the best of my knowledge), ISPs must still send them to customers to let them know that a copyright holder noticed them infringing upon their content."

In cases where there are heavy hitter pirates, so to speak, these companies could potentially come forward and bring the ISP to court in the hopes they will win an order to have the ISP release customer information.  Granted, this is not a very common practice in Canada due to the fact that monetary wins for these companies are very limited; fines can only range between $100 and $5000, whereas in the US, there have been numerous cases of people being sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single movie download. I doubt any company could convince a judge in Canada to levy the maximum $5000 fine against a person for a single infraction (if it even made it to court).  And finally, these companies who come to Canada looking for a quick score have to now send all infringement notice letters first to the legal department of the ISP in question for review. If it contains language akin to what we see in the US (Pay $100 now and this all goes away), it can be brought before a judge to have the language changed if the ISP feels the copyright company overstepped it's bounds."

My point is one of practice, where ease of use for (relatively) novice users with a sometimes limited command of English, and therefore not something that'd necessarily apply to the subscribers of this sub. It's important that providers understand that ""Click here to install our software if you can't get it via Google"" is one thing, and ""read and comprehend this tutorial on how to download our .ovpn files and then get them to work on your device"" is a somewhat different one.  Things most people assume are simple, like paying for service, can get a little bit complicated in places with no credit cards (yes, those exist), for example. Now, if you're going to present yourselves as offering a service that defends free speech and censorship from repressive governments or whatnot, my feeling is it's important to be coherent all the way, and take matters like those into account - which is why making sure that installation of the custom-rolled provider apps is as simple as possible."

You would need to edit the settings for the VPN type you are using but it should not be very hard. https://github.com/liquidvpn/dd-wrt-openvpn-config-creator here is a video on how to use the script on DDWRT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm3EyorNZig
VPN,3bgikx,smrdave,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:30:00 2015 UTC,Nice work. It looks like you are Liquid VPN or a Liquid VPN employee. I'll be checking you out.
VPN,3bgikx,mcgoo99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:23 2015 UTC,"VPNinja. you download the android configs, and it's easy to match what data goes where under the OpenVPN Client settings. plus this guide helped a lot.  http://www.myopenrouter.com/article/how-set-vpn-netgear-r6300-openvpn-and-dd-wrt"
VPN,3bgikx,Seattle_mr_it,0,Wed Jul 1 18:05:43 2015 UTC,It is OpeVPN. It seems like it would be easy but it just won't work.
VPN,3bfatk,bigupurself7,4,Sun Jun 28 18:35:07 2015 UTC,Run the VPN on your router.
VPN,3bfatk,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:25:42 2015 UTC,Any other options ? I have Verizon FiOS and I have to use their supplied router/modem
VPN,3bfatk,Shepherd7X,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any, sorry :/"
VPN,3bfatk,Bfoley45,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:43 2015 UTC,I posted something about this before only with Xbox but the concept should work.  http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/3745fr/vpn_for_xbox_360/ Hope it helps!

VPN,3bet7b,SentrixHD,4,Sun Jun 28 15:57:49 2015 UTC,This is not a good post for here. You will only start an argument.
VPN,3bet7b,Youknowimtheman,2,Sun Jun 28 17:39:33 2015 UTC,NordVPN. Been using them for 6 months now and I will re-subscribe when my subscription's up. They're top notch. Google is your friend.
VPN,3bflaj,Youknowimtheman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"VPNs, even in the vanilla OpenVPN app, should not silently fail and fail over to your regular connection. If this is happening, you should contact your VPN provider.  The only case where I can think this would happen is if the problem is between your PC and your router. DHCP could overwrite the routing table that was modified by the VPN. Even then the --redirect def1 option should cause the connection to fail rather than allow traffic."
VPN,3bflaj,2ntense,0,Sun Jun 28 20:42:04 2015 UTC,I know that there are Windows applications that disconnects your internet connection when you're disconnected from your VPN (this is called killswitch). I don't know if they're reliable though.
VPN,3bcmad,dutch4892,2,Sat Jun 27 23:11:57 2015 UTC,"yea, so long as you can configure the dsl gateways to forward ipsec traffic to the sonicwalls it should work, a friend of mine did this with a cheap tplink but its the same principle. let me know if you want more details"
VPN,3bcmad,ImperatorKon,2,Sun Jun 28 03:55:44 2015 UTC,Details would be great if you have them.  Otherwise I can probably flounder around and figure it out.
VPN,3bcmad,h_dd_dubs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"this can absolutely be done, also some other considerations such as separate LAN address space for each site need to be taken into account.    network devices are notoriously bad with caching DNS entries but nothing a power cycle can't fix, not ideal but..."
VPN,3be0ap,A_Sinclaire,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:27:30 2015 UTC,It may be a little overkill for what you're looking for but have looked into a VPN? /r/vpn
VPN,3be0ap,ChiefMedicalOfficer,2,Sun Jun 28 10:07:34 2015 UTC,Not really. As you say it does seem a bit too much for a few videos here and there :/
VPN,3be0ap,ChiefMedicalOfficer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:12:48 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Personally I would stay away from any of the free region unblockers.

VPN,3bbgst,zagbag,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:02:46 2015 UTC,Thank you. I found a VPN service in Charlotte that I am trying out.
VPN,3bbgst,traveler19395,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:15:25 2015 UTC,That's rather specific. Perhaps you have friends or family there?  They could host a VPN server on their router so you can use their IP from anywhere.
VPN,3bbgst,traveler19395,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:27:48 2015 UTC,Yes I have family there and if I could use their router then that would be ideal. Have any recommendations for hardware/software and guide on how to accomplish this? Thanks for your help.
