howtonotgiveafuck,3e1tqq,SecondBrownies,2,Tue Jul 21 09:10:40 2015 UTC,"You can do it Ciaran!   I wonder if this change in perception has anything to do with quitting your job. Perhaps you feel vulnerable as you're out of your normal routine and that's causing more anxiety about the challenges.  I read something about avoidance being bad as it reinforces the neural pathways in your brain so that you're more likely to avoid things in the future, where as if you consistently get out of your comfort zone and do what makes you uncomfortable, you're more likely to do that in the future [citation needed]."
howtonotgiveafuck,3e1tqq,Kazcube,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to change how you perceive yourself. For example, I was really fat. But I managed to keep the fat off because after a while, I stored seeing myself as fat and instead see myself as athletic. Of course, my actions back me up. I eat well and I work out frequently.  Likewise, you have to stop seeing yourself as _________ (shy, giving a fuck, scared of rejection).  I think it's hilarious that you asked for money for alcohol and that you're being quite creative in your pursuit of rejection.  Good stuff."

howtonotgiveafuck,3dz8zq,Sharobob,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't really believe in the whole ""100 days of rejection thing"" (Can-n I say that here?).    ""Approach anxiety"" (a term PU gave to general feelings of socially based anxiety) never goes away.  There...I said it.  Why is that a problem?  Why is getting a physiological response in relation to talking to strangers something to be ""cured""?    Focusing on overcoming ""approach anxiety"" is usually a project people take on to avoid dealing with more disturbing feelings.  Feelings of loneliness, poor self-image, inadequacy, etc.   What's easier...doing 100 approaches with the false goal of becoming some sort of social god or accepting the fact that maybe feeling lonely off and on will be an inescapable part of being human?  I'm not saying that cold approach never has its place.  It has opened up opportunities for me in the past.  But it is simply just another tool in the tool box.  It is not a lifestyle."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dz8zq,xEnsox,10,Tue Jul 21 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's even the point of this.   It's to prove to himself that he can do it. That the world doesn't end when he goes up to someone and gets rejected. I don't think he's expecting to come out of this a social god that can walk up to anyone and charm them, I view this as working on building up confidence in interaction with strangers. Maybe eventually it will be more difficult getting rejections because he'll have gained practice in having a soft open or developing a better first impression.  I find it interesting following the stories. I don't expect him to turn into James Bond but reading about his journey is inspiring me in my own little way to not worry so much about strangers' opinions because they affect my life so little at the end of the day."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dz8zq,Sharobob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"Let's put aside the OP's motivations for the experiment.   How does purposefully and consistently inviting rejection from strangers build up confidence?    All it does  is condition the person to expect rejection.  My opinion is that the experiment is a flawed form of gradual desensitization therapy.  Gradual systematic desensitization is not about throwing your kid into the deep end and seeing if he will figure out how to swim.    It's about taking the kid to the lake and letting him scope it out.  Then when he's comfortable, letting him stick his toe in.  Then letting him go in waist deep, etc.   If OP has social anxiety, it would make more sense to start small and build.  The objective should never be failure.  It should be success with the permission to fail.    Instead of asking random people asinine requests, maybe it would make more sense to simply ask for the time initially.  Then asking what they are doing that weekend.  Then maybe organizing a meet up."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dz8zq,yellowway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:38:02 2015 UTC,"But the thing is that this isn't swimming. You're scared of swimming because if you fuck up, you drown and die. What he is proving to himself is that rejection is nothing more than perceived risk rather than actual risk. Rejection isn't going to hurt you or change you permanently in any way so he's trying to prove that to himself.  I don't think he's conditioning himself to expect rejection but more to teach himself more that rejection can be a success in itself because that means you went out and tried even though you got shut down which is more than 90% of people out there can do."

Maybe they have deeper stuff to deal with, maybe they don't. Maybe they just want to challenge themselves. Maybe they want to get out of their comfort zone. Maybe they're bored. Maybe they are trying to learn new things. Maybe all of this. Maybe none.  In my view, this is much more about learning and experience than about just curing some sort of anxiety."

howtonotgiveafuck,3dze97,MereGirl,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a pretty visible case of acne, and one thing I've noticed is that most of the time it's much more of a big deal to me than it is to other people. What actually was bad was not the skin problem itself, but the way it made me act, like I had zero confidence. That was what drove people away, not the acne. So when I started to give 0 fucks about it I saw how little that actually mattered when dealing with other people.  But the thing is: fuck people. Even if someone is actually repelled by that problem, you're lucky such a person is not around you, seriously. Just be awesome and feel awesome around people who accept you and let the other suckers go away.  I know acne and rosacea are very different, the first being much more common, but that's all the experience I have with skin stuff, I hope it helps :)  Also, ever did you ever try finding some online community for people with rosacea? It might be of use too."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dxutd,vigilrexmei,5,Mon Jul 20 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's you not giving a fuck, or an internal fear of yours? For example, if you would not give a fuck about a person starting a conversation with you at the gym, you would just have the conversation, since you do not give a fuck. However, you don't WANT to have a conversation - that's something different. Ask yourself why you don't want to have it. It's ok to not want to have one, but don't confuse it with not giving a fuck. It seems you really actually DO give a fuck.  Same with going to visiting touristic sites. You don't WANT to go see those places. If you wouldn't give a fuck (not care), you wouldn't mind going to them. So you actually DO give a fuck about going to those places.  Rethink the whole not giving a fuck vs not wanting to do things. And if you don't want to do things, remember, it's OK, but ask yourself WHY don't you want to do those things and get to the roots. It is rooted in deep caring."

Because they can see your face? I think your comment history is a much more intimate revealer than your physical appearance.   If you're earnest in making your argument, I don't really see the difference. It is laying yourself bare for criticism if you ""remember the person."" Not everyone treats internet strangers as faceless automatons."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dudc7,ubrokemyphone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"It's greater for the reason you mention: they can't see your face or interact with you physically. Physical proximity can be very intimidating, even if the other person is not making any aggressive body language, the mere fact that in the back of your mind you know that they are close enough to hurt you, will subconciously lower your own aggressiveness. Unless you're of course an aggressive person. Then it works the other way around."

This same thing has happened to me over the last 10 years as I'm getting older and slowly and am able to start seeing people for what they really are... Selfish, thoughtless assholes who are ready to toss you into the furnace at a moments notice. Maybe not everyone is like this but I've done nothing but be kind, caring, generous and humble towards everyone I've met(mostly my closer friends) and none(a few still do) of them have any interest in attempting to show the same back to me. It's crazy O_o I feel like i've lost my best friend that I literally grew up with all because he's got a clingy GF who can't do anything without him. I want to make sense of this when there's no point racking my brain over it tbh.  I'm trying to justify why this is happening. My friends are getting older too. They work, they're getting married and starting families. Still I find myself asking why even though you can easily contact me through the web and my cell, why people will straight ignore me when I call or text but in person pretend like it's all good. As for the former... It sucks but people grow apart. I think it's just nature. Relationships over time fade away. Idk in my situation it's still to be determined honestly. I think my problem is I want to give in to giving people second chances when if I showed them the same amount of respect they showed me they'd likely never talk to me again.   Just do your best to stay strong through these tough times. Nothing's harder than getting knocked down but it takes chops to get back up and keep pressing on and that's exactly what I'd like to see from you.   Do an inventory of your friends and send them all a few things(like a text, and call and a email or internet message) See who responds and ask, if you see the others around, why they couldn't. I really hate to see others going through this but like I said it's something that a lot of us have to deal with unfortunately. The world we live in is an ugly place and that's why you gotta find other people who know it sucks and are prepared to rock the fuck out as hard as you rock.   Stay strong and give it your best.

howtonotgiveafuck,3dt0m7,yagi-san,9,Tue Jul 21 04:30:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone who has responded so far as well as OP have one thing in common - being very nice and getting taken advantage of. (And before I get flamed, I am the same way and I've seen the same thing happen to me, so I get it.) We give and have expectations that we will receive the same in return. And so we get disappointed and hurt, because it never seems to happen for us, but we see our ""friends"" do that for others and don't understand why.  The problem, I think, is twofold. One, people are very self-centered by nature, and we are usually motivated to satisfy our own needs. We all make decisions based on what we want and need, and others don't really factor into our thought process. The majority of the time, people are not thinking about you, and they do what they feel they need to do to make themselves happy. So, I think that most of the time, people aren't really trying to take advantage of us or screw us over or be mean to us, they are just doing what they need to do and our feelings aren't even in the equation, and this isn't even a conscious thing, it just is.  The second part of the problem is that we are the same as those that we want to get mad at. When are giving and caring to others, we are mostly motivated by how we feel about ourselves and what we want in return - in other words, we want to feel like we're good people and want to be recognized as such by those around us. So we feel hurt and rejected and blame everyone for treating us badly, but we continue to do the same thing and nothing changes.  So how do we not give a fuck about all of this? First, have realistic expectations about others and what motivates them, and don't take it personally when they don't seem to give a fuck about our feelings. This doesn't make them bad people, just normal. I believe that most people aren't inherently bad, just selfish, and the more I realize that they are just looking out for themselves and not really thinking about me, the less I take it personally and move on.  Second, accept that we are trying too hard to get validation from others about ourselves by being giving people. This tends to be the hardest thing to do, because it's so much easier to blame others than to accept responsibility for our own actions. However, this is the thing that we have the most power over, and what really allows us to not give a fuck. I've come to believe that when I give to others, I do so because I want to give for its own sake, without expectations of return. I give because I like who I am when I do so, but I also look out for myself and don't let myself be used, either.  Finally, one more point to consider, and that is that we tend to attract and be surrounded by people that reflect how we act and present ourselves. In other words, if you find yourself surrounded by assholes, look within and figure out what it is about you that attracts them to you. If your circle of friends is full of selfish assholes, you're a selfish asshole as well or you do something that attracts them, like be a doormat.  I guarantee that when you start to change your perception of you and just be comfortable and confident in who you are and who you want to be, you will find the people around you either changing to accomodate you or you will find new people crossing over into your circle of influence. Either way, it all begins and ends with us not giving a fuck and doing what we think is right."

You've laid it all out in a logical manner. And, you know, I agree with you. I do give unselfishly, because I like to give things to people, I like to help them, a Psych degree was my life goal, I don't really expect anything in return. But it's true, people are living their own lives and I have to look out for myself. And validation is something I strive for. I don't even care if validation is just a thank you, but at the same time, validation can't come at all times because people are living their lives how they want, even if I am not a part of it, and I can still know and be awesome even if they don't know and I don't have the opportunity to show them that.  Thanks so much for your HNGAF advice!"

I still have my moments where I let other people get to me too much, but then I remember this and get my perspective back.  To me, HNGAF means to be good with who I want to be and strive to meet my standards, regardless of what others think. If you think about it, most of our problems with NGAF is that we care too much about what others think. When we can just limit our giving of fucks to what matters to us (what we want and believe and what those we really care about think of us), then we don't care so much about the rest of it."

howtonotgiveafuck,3dt0m7,dgillz,3,Sun Jul 19 09:35:45 2015 UTC,"The same thing happened to me too. I was always contacting them, found out a few times they didn't invite me out too.   First thing you have to do is understand that these people, while they might be friendly, they're probably just acquaintances than close or good friends. If that is the case, it's simple - go find some new friends. Drop them. They probably won't call you for months."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dt0m7,purplelephant,2,Sun Jul 19 13:19:56 2015 UTC,"No one really contacts me. I get social anxiety about it, so how do you recommend I find new friends? I'm almost considering making friends again through the internet, because at least there's more interest and need to have conversations to get to know them, and it's fairly reciprocal."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dt0m7,purplelephant,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"The best way I have found to make friends is to join a group for things you enjoy; like climbing, tennis, boxing, crossfit, gaming whatever it is. Don't just try 1 thing, try them all and you'll see that you'll end up making friends here and there.  What about studying? Going back to school?  Write a long list of all the things you enjoy and start finding things in your area that you can do. I had a friend last year that moved to a new country, he ended up working at a charity during the weekends and ended up making a good bunch of friends. Remember, friends don't need to be the same age as you - similar interests is what counts."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dt0m7,purplelephant,2,Sun Jul 19 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"I love your suggestions. I've looked into them, but motivating myself to do them is the problem. I have been wanting to work for some animal non-profits, so maybe I should find one that I can volunteer at on the weekends.  That's a great example, moving to a new country is a very different experience than moving a few cities away, especially to such a densely populated city. Things are out here, I just have to go out and do them, other wise I'll keep sitting and being ""lonely"". Thank you."

We would get together sometimes, but I felt as if they were all hanging out without me a whole lot. It turns out that they were. They had a whole social scene taht I was not part of. I decided to just cut them out and look around at who was left. It turns out that I had a whole bunch of other friends that were eager for me to hang out with them and they quickly welcomed me into their group. Now I am included when plans are made. I also get lots of invitations to do things one-on-one with these wonderful people.  They had been there all along, but I was blowing them off because I was chasing after the other group.    I hope you find your tribe.  Edit: It took me about a year to grieve the loss of my ""friends"" and really feel part of this other group."

Honestly, I have people who I think are great friends, but even they have (for lack of a better term) ""screwed me over."" I wouldn't even know where to start in looking at who I have left.  I hope I do, too. It would be nice to have at least one person outside of my family who is interested and wants to hang out with me, just as I will want to do with them."

I found myself having a great conversation with a friend who I saw intermittently, but who I trusted. As we were hanging out, I thought, ""I always feel better after I hang out with her"" and decided to tell her my whole situation. She listened and responded kindly, and then started inviting me to everything she did. She had been wanting me to free up my schedule for her for a long time! I tried this with a few other people and the same thing happened. But it was scary scary scary to open up and be so vulnerable to people! It turns out that when I feel good hanging out with people (really good, not ""ooh these people are so cool, they are going to make my life better"", but GOOD as in ""I can really be myself around these folks and they seem to LIKE it!"" kind of good) they are feeling good too and want to spend more time together.   There were a few misses too. There were people I reached out to, did stuff with, and then it just kind of fizzled.   Like I said, one year. One trip around the sun, one year of making ""annual plans"" and leaving old annual plans behind. Getting through birthdays, holidays, etc without the old group.   Good luck to you!"

If I expect something to be good and it isn't then I risk giving a fuck ( anger/dispointed)  If I expect something to be bad then I worry and give a fuck.

I cut them out of my life if they begin to be something I don't want to be around. I've done this with several people and it's done my soul wonders.   I also let myself feel.

It'd be interesting to know if it actually had any lasting effect on me... it was the first time I had come across that level of psychological mindfuck, and I did not like it. Oddly enough now, psychological mindfuck/horror is probably one of my favourite genres of any kind of media, and it didn't take long after reading The Stranger to start to specifically search out that type of thing, including beginning to ask myself the question: ""What kind of stories could I tell that would reproduce the gutwrenching loss of hope and happiness that I myself experienced reading this book?"""

I wouldn't be surprised if she played you to make you feel guilty.  But I feel you, though.

howtonotgiveafuck,3dk5nq,ViscaBarca10,10,Thu Jul 16 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"It's the same concept used to explain why Denmark (or Norway?) Is the happiest country in the world: they have lower/no expectations.   When you expect everything to be awesome all the time, anything less than perfect is a disappointing.    I heard a woman in the nail salon yesterday talking about how ""bad"" her vacation was because it rained two days and the beach was crowded.  And the thing is that makes sense. That sounds like a disappointing vacation. We are so conditioned to expect these instagram perfect tropical beaches that the fact she was away from work, on a beach with people she cared about is no longer enough.  A few flaws or bumps in the road, a change in plans and it's a ""bad time"".   It's apparent in our everyday exchanges. It's common to greet someone with ""How are you?"" And the expected response in America is ""good"" or ""great"". A reply of ""okay"" or ""normal"" creates an awkward social situation.  That person is suddenly seen as ""negative"" or a ""downer"". But when we're expected to be ""good/great"" all the time then we start to expect to actually feel that way. And anytime we don't then something is wrong. Desperately wrong. And that makes us feel worse.  And that's a huge contributing factor to the high rates of depression in the US."

How does the message of this article square with the idea that we should be always looking to better ourselves, to reach for higher and more challenging goals, etc.?  If being average was more socially acceptable (especially here in the US, where ardent capitalism and one-upmanship reign supreme),  what would happen to our population of over achievers, who all seem so allergic to just being average?"
howtonotgiveafuck,3dk5nq,Agnostix,3,Fri Jul 17 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"The way i read it, was that it was more about accepting a mediocre result as acceptable and to not beat yourself up about it.   Have dreams, have goals, work hard for them but don't expect perfection."

howtonotgiveafuck,3djsft,Kazcube,3,Thu Jul 16 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"Yay, congrats!   If after your 100 day challenge you really want to challenge yourself, try and find the people out and about on the street getting people to give money to charity and ask for a job with them  They have a really high staff turnover so generally they don't say no, and you can decide not to work with them on a days notice and it's nothing new  Your whole day is filled with interactions like this, people who flat out don't want to talk to you, people who stop and you find out incredible things about another human, rude people, polite people.   It's an exhausting job, but you learn so much about yourself and other people - within a safe environment with a team leader and a team around you to give you support!  I worked these jobs for a few months in Australia, they're simultaneously the best and worst jobs ever haha"
howtonotgiveafuck,3djsft,needsmorezazz,2,Fri Jul 17 04:11:55 2015 UTC,"I must get asked by at least 2 fundraisers each day. Walking through the city centre reminds me of Pokemon where you have to go around the back of the trainers or get challenged as soon as they see you.  I can imagine it's a difficult job if you aren't accustomed to approaching people and getting rejected. I refuse every time, but I'm always polite and sometimes have a brief conversation. I work for a charity, volunteer for a charity, and personally raise funds for other charities, so if I wanted to donate to somewhere, I'd look into where those funds actually go and organise it myself, but I understand that a lot of people make that decision on the spot when asked in the street.  At the moment, my goal is rejection of course, but if something else comes of approaching someone, then I'm just going with it. It's nice to connect with people and have conversations that never would've happened otherwise, but I feel that if I was doing it in a professional capacity, it wouldn't be as genuine, because I'd have to bring the conversation around to them giving me money. Did you feel that way when you were doing it?  And is your username a Metapocalypse reference? I fucking love Murderface."
howtonotgiveafuck,3djsft,needsmorezazz,2,Fri Jul 17 08:19:14 2015 UTC,"hahaha that's such an excellent way of describing it  Yeah I definitely felt that way too, I eventually just gave up on signing people up and just went to work to talk to people tbh I completely disagree with those jobs, but they're great practice at dealing with people of all kinds and dealing with rejection. Like the first year of donations goes to the company you work for and not the charity, but it must be profitable otherwise all charities wouldn't be doing it  and yes, yes it is. I haven't watched the latest season though ):"
howtonotgiveafuck,3djsft,no_ripcord,2,Fri Jul 17 08:38:18 2015 UTC,haha. i've recently started doing a free hugs thing - where you stand out front of a central station with a sign offering free hugs. i didn't even realise a massive part of it is rejection. so many people walk past and reject your hugs. but it's also truly amazing when you can tell you really made someone's day with such a small gesture.

It's hard because it's the exact opposite of what we're meant to think, and when we have been raised in an emotionally manipulative way. We still have to keep on living though.   You always have time to do something. Maybe it's finding a job one day, adapting your resume the next day, planning the cover letter the next day and writing it. You just need to fricking try.

howtonotgiveafuck,3die20,docb30tn,2,Fri Jul 17 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly! The video isn't saying 'be successful' it's saying 'try'.  Someone posted a link here a few days ago, check out the lecture on Epictetus: There are some things in your control and somethings which are not in your control. Taking an action and interpreting events beyond your control is 100% within your control.  As someone who has been looking for a job for the best part of a year, you eventually realize that sometimes they just want someone else. There might be someone with a better degree or more experience, and that's okay. If you did your best, that's all you can do. Be pissed off but then make the next application. Eventually it will happen. I hope."

howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,eastrod,65,Wed Jul 15 23:37:18 2015 UTC,"As cliche as this may sound, this movie changed my life when I first saw it in my early 20's.  I'd grown up mildly bullied and trying hard to fit in, get cool things to get girls all while being jealous of celebrities and the successful wishing that I was them.   After seeing this movie with two other similarly afflicted 'average' friends, we discussed the futility of striving to be popular for popularity's sake and instead agreed to work on bettering ourselves. Since then two of the three of us went to trade school where we landed great jobs that we enjoy and along the way happened to meet wonderful girls that were attracted to our carefree lifestyle. The third guy wanted to start his own business and after a few years of hard work and living on the cheap, determined to carve out his place in the city we live in, he is now living out his dream. He just recently met a girl as well who shares his ambitions and supports his goals of expanding his business and they couldn't be happier!  Now you may say, 'Eastrod, that doesn't sound like much of a success story. What does this have to do with Fight Club or not giving a fuck anyway?' While we may be living what seem like average lives, all three of us made these lives for ourselves on our terms. We stopped giving a fuck about girls and money and possessions - none of which we had to begin with - and focused instead on bettering ourselves with things like practical skills and good attitudes and those other things came along naturally. None of us are crazy rich but none of us are crazy in debt from spending money we don't have or rich but depressed we aren't as rich as that other guy. None of us liked being single for years during this process but in time, the right person came along for each of us. Best of all, the three of us can look back satisfied with the choices we made because we didn't have delusions of being movie stars or millionaires - who gives a fuck anyway as long as you're happy? While Tyler Durden's message is dark, the flip side is that once you take away all the bullshit entitlement, the high expectations and the need to have all the best things, you truly are free to just be yourself and make a life you can be proud of.   TL;DR Fight Club is my favorite movie. It helped me and some friends stop giving a fuck and we all turned out alright ~10 years later!"

howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,the_new_KING,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"I kinda struggle with this because, well, why the fuck can't I be a millionaire? There's a 1% out there that's super wealthy, I don't see why I can't get into that 1% if I play my cards right. I feel like taking a lowkey job or doing something adventurous that doesn't pay well (snowboard instructor, for example) would be selling myself short. It's possible, so if I'm not doing it I feel like I'm failing. I'll have a family someday, I want to afford food for them and be able to pay for their college without adding another 10-20 years to my retirement age. The goal is get enough money so I can stop caring about money and focus on relationships and stuff I actually enjoy, rather than spend 8-10 hours every single day away from that doing things I dislike all in the name of money. What scares me is if I fail, then what? That's what gets my anxiety up. Then I have to waste so much time every single day just to get some green paper, THEN I'm allowed to be a human again. THEN I'm allowed to have free will. But only after I've sold over half of my waking life to some corporation. Like if I don't end up having money to support myself forever by like 40 or so I don't know how I'll be able to keep going being a slave like that...

howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,StatMeansNow,7,Wed Jul 15 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"I've often thought about number 5: how advertising triggers our evolutionary urges. It's as if inside every human is an ape fighting for its life. The ape's natural urges all have an important purpose, but they're simple, and easily manipulated (by other humans, because of our extensive understanding of these urges). We face a challenge that no other animal has ever faced: we must decide when our natural urges are helpful and when they are a liability."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,Kaizerina,2,Wed Jul 15 08:47:29 2015 UTC,"As an aspie, I've never quite understood how people can't see through this type of advertising and control their subconscious; many aspies can do this consciously, and thus have an inner and outer consistency of belief and action that few can rival. I'm just now realizing that not everyone can do this, because not for everyone is the subconscious conscious. But I do believe that all people can do this -- not just certain people on the spectrum. Maybe it's up to we few aspies and auties to teach people the mental powers that are innate within us in order to help humanity move forward? Idk I'm just brainstorming."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,the_new_KING,2,Wed Jul 15 19:58:11 2015 UTC,"I'm an advertising major at a really good school, and you're exactly right. Most people can tell what we're trying to do, many can even point to specific things and tell us what urge we're putting pressure on. However, when most people consume media (browse reddit, watch tv, ect.) they are turning their brain off intentionally for a chance to rest. Seeing through the advertising techniques to determine what primal urge the ad is leaning on requires critical evaluation of the add, full attention, and a desire to see through the ad (and even more of these to find an alternative/defense to the advertised thing). While watching in an inactive cognitive state, we humans just let things slip into our subconscious without us realizing it, because our guard is down. You see the hot girl and the sports car, and while you might normally think this is a stupid ad and really obviously selling cars with sex and power, watching the same TV after a long day at work without paying much attention will make an active impression on your inactive mind. Enough of these minor impressions from ads later, and you now associate that kind of car with sex and power whether you want to or not."

I have about five ad blocks on my browser. And I almost never let my guard down in that respect -- I'm always trying to analyse and think critically.   Don't you feel... a bit dirty about what you do? How do you feel about directly contributing to and profiting from the downfall of humankind? Jk la dramatisme, c'est moi. :-D"
howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,the_new_KING,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:29:38 2015 UTC,"Advertising is a necessary part of an economy. Without advertising and branding, people wouldn't know products existed, where to find them, or how to differentiate products from other products. Just because advertising has come a long way and is now backed by various persuasive theories and research doesn't make anything worse or better. I don't feel bad at all, I do, however, feel bad for the people weak enough to allow themselves to be swayed by anything and believe everything they read or see. Consumerism is just another vice people with weak willpower succumb to."

My career has also taken a turn and what I had worked for all my life is also no longer attainable. I am not sure what I want to do with my life now, but that doesn't bother me.   I have NOTHING to lose, NOTHING anyone can take from me and I feel free and happy. I used to own a house, a car, have a husband, a family and a career, I was so unhappy.

I went home, sat down at the kitchen table and said I had to change my life. For me the line that affected me the most was, ""The things we own, begin to own us."" At that time I was a guitar player. That was my life. It was my identity. A realized that guitar playing had become a prison. I had lost out on so many things because I always had to practice. I had had a brief thought about quitting a month or so early when I had taken mushrooms, but it was just too scary. However, after seeing the movie I did it. I went from playing the guitar 6 hours a day, to not touching it for 3 years. It was the scariest thing that I have done in my life, and the most liberating. I might have made that change at some point in the future even if I hadn't seen the movie. But I know that it definitely had an impact on me.

howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,cranky_p,2,Wed Jul 15 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"I subconsciously followed advice from the film, I realised this after I re watched it recently. I lived in an underdeveloped part of china for 9 months, i let myself go and lived far more freely, then I got into my first real fight and it felt great. I never knew who I really was til I went through all that. Now I just want to go back, the western treadmill I've been on is just so superficial."
howtonotgiveafuck,3dcblb,satisfyreality,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:29 2015 UTC,"I never post anything here anymore.  But these still rain true.  I left the city with a backpack on the train and moved west, with no prospects, hating life.  After 6 months in a tent, many ups and downs, anxiety, an alcoholic lifestyle, a long term relationship, several moves and travels later, I fell into a calm, happy life style on my own terms and an almost enlightenment from these ideas.  I finally felt happy when I just gave up, by brain quieted down so I could concentrate, I can hear the truth for what felt like the first time of my life,  everything I do know is out of necessity, I lost my entitlement to everything.  Don't get me wrong, I work hard, I'm comfortable, I feel good in my skin, but I gave up on life and let go and am a million times better because of it.  I feel like how the Christians only can describe as walking with God, and having faith, or how niche described the übermensch.  I learned that I kind of liked being depressed sometimes, it's when I was the most honest with myself, and that's ok. Give up, and just let life happen to you, the bad stuff and the odd stuff is just as great or better than the good times."

howtonotgiveafuck,3d80yp,eatmorepossum,5,Wed Jul 15 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting point for discussion.  I always took the spirit of this sub to mean ""how to be confident enough to not give a fuck what others think and live your dreams"".  Listening to the first 20 minutes of the speaker his point seemed more to the tune of ""how to not give a fuck about what it means to live in a society and be kind and decent to others and selfishly do what ever feels go to you"".  I heard him talk about encouraging his friends to light up cigarettes in a bar and tell the employees who are put in the awful position of telling you to obey the law to fuck off.  Then he went on to say what a free thinker he was that he refused to pay any taxes because he didnt want to.  When the tax man came he just told them to fuck off.  This type of idiotic rhetoric seems better fit for /r/anarchy and will probably resonate with thirteen year olds who haven't contemplated what it means to be a decent human being.  To me, not giving a fuck means prioritizing your own dreams above your fears of what others think of you.  It means being the first one in your family to get a college degree when many people have told you you're not smart enough.   It means having the courage to get up on stage and do a stand up set in front of an audience even though you know you might bomb.  It means going snow skiing for the first time even though you dont know how and will probably fall many times in front of others who may laugh and point from the ski lift.  Just my take on the sub though.  I guess the upvotes will be the final judge."

But since that philosopher took not the slightest notice of Alexander, and continued to enjoy his leisure in the suburb Craneion, Alexander went in person to see him; and he found him lying in the sun. Diogenes raised himself up a little when he saw so many people coming towards him, and fixed his eyes upon Alexander. And when that monarch addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, ""Yes,"" said Diogenes, ""stand a little out of my sun."" It is said that Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and jesting about the philosopher as they went away, ""But truly, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."""

howtonotgiveafuck,3d2udz,ngf15,8,Mon Jul 13 02:07:07 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue. I remember once my boss yelling in my face and i gave 0 fucks. My coworkers were baffled. But about a year after that time i read a book. (And fuck that book) it was called never eat alone. And after that i gave wayyy too many fucks about my professional career. Life got a lot worse after that and coworkers liked me less. Because i always had low grade visible physical stress in social situations. Its odd how a book can make a negative impact but so can any brainwashing.   I think the idea that certain things are ""important"" is where we go wrong in DGAF. Im over that professional gotta network bullshit because it hasnt worked.   You dont need a good job. Nobody does. Good jobs dont even really exist. Lawyers? Unless youre working for a high rated law firm youre at 45k. Doctors? Overworked and in tution debt. Bankers? Sketchy and shaky jobs.  All our worries come from illusions of what we need and dont need. We would all survive on a job at mcdonalds. There should be no reason to fret. We dont need a ferrai or tiffanys necklace. That is stupid pointless shit that is brainwashed into us by people who convince you that its needed.   I have a friend who ""needs"" 30 gucci handbags. She gets upset if the new fall season comes out and she doesnt have it.   I was convinced (brainwashed) by my family to go into business. Did not work out all.  We are being brainwashed all the time. Dont let it get into your head that a job is something you need. Or any particular one. Maybe .being a farmer is your true calling or even going into another business would totally suit you. Or maybe all jobs would suit you. Or maybe changing career paths would be the best thing to do instead of doing the same damn thing all your life."

howtonotgiveafuck,3d2udz,sit12,6,Thu Jul 16 00:21:21 2015 UTC,"Hey u/ngf15 !   This is such an interesting question. It absolutely is, and it's the only possible way to make it to where you want to be IN your professional life.   Just to give you some background, my name is Jordan. I got my MBA at 21 while taking over as CEO of an international marketing agency. I've founded two more companies and am now focusing on the mind-body-life academy cnqr.co.   I bike to work, play trap music over our office speakers, wear dri-fits and shorts, and I didn't even blink an eye when I lost a $40,000 sale because I sent an email that said, ""Hey Tom, would appreciate a response. -Jordan"" and he emailed my boss at the time complaining about my rash behavior. So that's when my NGAF journey probably started ;)   Now, I know some of my advice won't be fair because I am an Entrepreneur. And a struggling one for a long-ass time. But I made that CHOICE, and that is what I want to talk about with you. Choice.   A. You have to find your values. When you have your own personal values that YOU have sat down and thought about, you can't be touched.   My #1 value is freedom. After that comes fairness. Those aren't right or wrong values! They are just the ones that I have learned I enjoy living my life by.   Because I know my values, I can guide my choices. I don't want a corporate job, because I lose my freedom. I was willing to grind making less than minimum wage because I know there are going to be exponential results.   I don't hand out cash to homeless people. But I will direct them to staffing agencies, and even coached a guy to start his lawn care business. I don't like charity, but I love providing empowerment. Just another value.   Once you have your values,   B. Your life is only in someone else's hands if you give them that opportunity. Don't give that away.   As you go through school, you need to be building SKILLS. When you have skills, you are a valuable employee across industries and locations.   Save some some cash for a month or two so you know you'll be safe, and then you don't have to worry any more. You should be able to walk out of any situation you want to be in, and maybe that's an immature answer, but who cares?   If you were raised super religious like I was, you may subconsciously believing at every moment there is a giant man in the sky judging your choices, writing them down, and then sending you to a fire-y pit at the middle of the earth. That can have a pretty HUGE effect on your interactions in the world. So... you may be dealing with some bigger issues down the line depending on what you choose to believe in :)  C. Separate yourself from the game, learn the rules, and get really good at them. Here's what I mean.  You are going to play these politics if you want to climb the ladder, but there is nothing wrong with that. It's going to be a blast.   Sorry to get all Zen on you, but there was no ""you"" in that meeting. It was a just a brain reacting to being attacked.  If you were playing the game, you would be aware of that as it happens in the moment without letting it get to you too much. When you step away from the situation and watch it unfold, you have a CHOICE on how to react.   So once you understand there is a game being played (you already do-- and remember this is just a game, dude. All of this.) you can learn the rules.   That's the skill building, networking, selling, etc. Read, practice, learn.   It's no fun to fake confidence and competence in the corporate world, because you will get caught.   But when you enter the room with real skill and confidence, this whole ""trying not to give a shit"" thing doesn't even come up anymore.   When I go into a room of multi-million dollar board members and sell, I'll wear a suit just to make them happy, but my shorts are in my car, and I tell them that.   I ask questions and deliver my pitch because I am sincerely there with the skills to help them, and I will deliver those skills to the best of my abilities.   So when they say ""no"", or ""stupid idea, dumbass"". I can laugh and go, ""wait, haha, why is that a bad idea?"" and either I learn something new, or that person gets called out. It's just my ideas, not ME.   When you go into a job interview, you are interviewing the JOB too! If your boss seems like an asshole, don't you dare take it. If you can't find any other job, that's a skill problem, so get back to learning.   I'm pretty sure I'm just rambling, but I hope this was helpful. If you wanna hit me back with some questions you might have in the comments maybe we can help other people reading too."
howtonotgiveafuck,3d2udz,jdarbuckle,3,Mon Jul 13 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"No rambling at all, this is solid advice. How did you find out what your top values are ?"
howtonotgiveafuck,3d2udz,haydukk,3,Mon Jul 13 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for this post. It's quite enlightening.  I was in pharmacy school, to give you some context. I've switched out since actually, because I won't take their bullshit anymore. Most people I've talked to hate the fact that you have no freedom, even the pharmacists at my part time job. If a patient wants to talk to you about their 12 cats, and all the random crap that would make even an awkward nerd cringe, you have to stand there and listen to that bullshit, even if it takes up 20 minutes of your time (I asked that to the pharmacist I was working with why she didn't just say she was busy - she said that's part of your job). You're everyone's bitch as a pharmacist; it's basically a highly educated customer service job - and you know customer service is basically, take all the bullshit because the customer is always right. There's not much difference of skills between you and the pharmacist across the street, so the customer chooses whoever's going to bend over more. So yeah, I took my first step to regaining my freedom in life. Being neutered for the next 40 years of my life for some money isn't worth it.  So I guess I got A down so far. As for B, how did you develop your skills? Also, I read a quote from House of Cards that said ""You don't want to work anywhere you're not willing to get fired from, Zoe. Treading water is the same as drowning, for people like you and me. Good luck, I'll be watching"", what's your thought on that?  Finally, I'm thinking of going the entrepreneur route too; my career personality test results from years ago when graduating high school put me as entrepreneur (I thought it was bullshit and didn't listen). What are your tips going that route?  Again, this was an incredibly interesting read. Thanks."

For example, taking the ""marketing"" position in all groups of school to get better at it. You have to do something anyway, right?  Yes, and you're willing to get fired by building skills, so you know you are valuable wherever you go. Pick relevant ones in your industry, for example..... Want to be a Trep? Solve a problem. You're in pharma. Your patients take too much time. Maybe you need to create a questionaire or app or program that solves that.    Learn the skills you need to solve that problem.

Does this mean IGAF? Yes and no. The less fucks I give generally means I'm getting paid less. It'd be awesome to have a kickass green mohawk but as I have to work at clients' sites, I gotta look professional. It's a tradeoff, but I'm willing to accept it as I get paid reasonably well for this.   My free time? I spend it drinking beer on my porch wearing my dragon kigurumi, or take my big-ass inflatable dragons to the lake to play with. Or do whatever I want. What's the worst that could happen? Someone at work finds out? Meh. It's not basis for firing me. And if they fired me, whatever, one phone call or IM later I've got a new job. Or if I didn't unemployment benefit would be enough to cover my bare minimum expenses.   Oh hey IT guy, nice to see you're stalking my desktop! That's illegal in this country and I'm on my coffee break anyway :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,3d347j,Squid4Hire,3,Mon Jul 13 03:33:00 2015 UTC,"Apathy is the complete opposite of not giving a fuck, according to Mark Manson. Not giving a fuck means to not care about adversity, not not caring about yourself and your values. In fact, you should care a lot about yourself and your values.  Here's the difference:  Imagine a scenario when you're standing in line at McDonald's. Someone cuts in line in front of you.   Apathetic response (I give too much fucks about what others will think if I react, so I'll just convince myself that it's okay): pretend like you don't care. Not giving a fuck response (you don't care about how people will judge you): you call out the guy ""the line starts back there!"" because you care about your values: fairness/justice.   Read this: http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck  Quoting from it:   When most people envision giving no fucks whatsoever, they envision a kind of perfect and serene indifference to everything, a calm that weathers all storms.  This is misguided. There’s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They’re couch potatoes and internet trolls. In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they actually give too many fucks. They are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. Therefore, they make none. They hide in a grey emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life."

I'm not confident, so I fake confidence. Faking it until I make it would mean feigning confidence until I get a girlfriend.

howtonotgiveafuck,3d347j,itsjh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:16 2015 UTC,"There's two ways of not giving a fuck about other people I think. First one is to simply not take anything personal, that whatever someone says or does, it comes with a clear understanding that it has nothing to do with you. That's their experiences and learnt behavior that you by accident happen to trigger. The second way of not giving a fuck is the kind that block yourself in order to not deal with whatever they trigger in you. This is often in my experience automatic and out of ones awareness and this not giving a fuck feels confident but makes you unhappy and numb inside. Sometimes people build a story of how boring other people are or how shallow/stupid/naive they are as a kind of very clever defence mechanism. So I think the key is self-awareness to find out how you hide from yourself and face those fears. The best tool for this is meditation I think. Meditation also makes me more empathic and interested in other people. Meditation has also been a great tool to see what stops me from doing what I want, or realizing what I actually want. There's no mumbo jumbo to this, it's purely a practice on self-awareness. I'm not sure if this is of any help to you but if you're interested on how to get started, let me know."
howtonotgiveafuck,3d347j,Nesii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"There is a huge difference between NGAF and apathy. You seem to ve, by your own admission, apathetic. I understand this because I go through bouts of it all the time. There is no solid one fits all answer for being more empathetic or sympathetic to other's cares.   You can start however by simply challenging yourself to take care of yourself the best way you can. Brush your teeth, make your bed, comb your hair, keep doing little things for yourself, and eventually you will be caring for yourself.   For others, it is also in the little things. What helps me (may not be for everyone) is a sort of realisation that these other people, like me, lead lives of varying degrees of difficulty and adversity. By merely asking how someone's day is you give them at least a shred of joy at the prospect that someone gives a damn.  It just takes time. Finding what in life matters and what we should give =< a fuck about is part of the journey after all. As is finding out what doesn't really matter.  That's my 2¢ for what it's worth. Hope it helps."

Ugh have to find it. But this line stuck in my head recently.  It's good to know this so that you keep your esteem up & so you don't get anxious & so you won't fuck up more in your work, etc due to not being able to concentrate/mistake lingering on your mind. But if you know it's not your fault, or that it's ok, you can just move forward and get the things you know you can do, done.  Like not being nervous in an interview/speaking because you feel you really do understand things due to the amount of research & practise you've put in."

Don't feel too bad about walking around for ages and finding the right type of person to approach because I've been guilty of that myself. When I told a man I thought he was hot and asked him on a date I spent some time finding a guy who looked like he wouldn't stab me before asking, all you need to do is be aware of what happened, i.e Purposefully vetting the people you approached and make a point to try and not do it in future, I was forever telling people about the rejection game at first and I did that out of nerves and wanting to let them know I wasn't weird. It isn't something I do anymore. Well I sometimes do but it's not down to fear, more just that telling them about the challenge felt like the right thing to do given the conversation we were having."

howtonotgiveafuck,3cft74,capass,15,Tue Jul 7 18:59:11 2015 UTC,"To take a piece of advice from No More Mr. Nice Guy: Learn to not try to control what you have no control over and spend your energy on what you can control.  Meaning e.g. you can't control how your boss will respond to your request for a raise or how a girl/guy will respond to you asking them out, so just accept that whatever happens everyone involved will survive and nobody will like you any less because you asked. What you can control is deciding to actually ask, instead of being scared to ask. You can only control your own actions, and never the outcome.  I disagree with you that we shouldn't care about the result. Of course we should care about the result, why else would we be doing anything to get the result we want, in the first place? We should accept that we can't control what the result is and thus we should be ready to accept rejection as well as success, but we should definetely care about the result."

I understand you want to help your family recover, maybe to a state similar to what it once was, but there's no way you could ""shape"" your family members. All you can do is shape your own behaviour. Your mother and sister know just as well as you do that there are problems in your family, and frankly it's their responsibility, not yours, to fix their own issues. I know it's stressful, especially when it comes to your family, but I hope you can at the very least ease your own pain. Because at the end of the day it's your family and if you want them to give a fuck about you you gotta give a fuck about them too.

Plus, like you said, a lot of credits will transfer over anyway and since you have geneds out of the way it shouldn't be much of an issue to go for it.  Tons of people do the same thing every year."
howtonotgiveafuck,3cgp56,JohanBroad,2,Wed Jul 8 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of those are degree requirements. I am going for my AA in Welding, and I had to take English, History, a Science class, a Humanities class, and a few others that have nothing to do with Welding or Fabricating metal.  However, as ""useless"" as they were, I found that I enjoyed them.  I liked learning about art history, I enjoyed writing papers for English.   I found them to be intellectually stimulating, and in some cases amusing.  The idea behind requiring classes like this is to 'round out' your degree into a more comprehensive education, not just give you a basic set of certifications in one specific field.   If the classes you mentioned were electives, they were still not a waste.    I'm assuming you are still in your twenties, so I'm not surprised at all that you found that you have no further interest in your original Major.  I'm 45, and I am retraining after spending a couple of decades not knowing what I really wanted, and I feel like I have wasted a lot of time in shitty jobs that I didn't really choose, but wound settling for.  Now that I am studying Welding, I can see dozens of directions I can go with a Welding technology degree.    So don't regret your ""wasted"" classes.  You might find yourself listening to music and realizing that you understand it better than you did before you took the class.  The psych classes might help you in dealing with people you have to work with, regardless of the field you are in.  In the end, it doesn't really matter, because Life is not all about making money and being a 'success""(whatever that means).   If you learned something that is interesting or enjoyable, it wasn't a waste at all."

howtonotgiveafuck,3c7eol,kismetjeska,5,Sun Jul 5 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"This is weird place to get advice since you have to give a little bit of a fuck (pun intended) in order for a romantic relationship to work, but I'll try to help out anyway.  Since you said ""boyfriend"" and not ""ex-boyfriend"" I'm going to assume you guys are currently together.  From what I can tell, it seems you have some self-esteem issues that you've been avoiding that are now displaying themselves as insecurities with your boyfriend.   DO NOT place your self-worth in the hands of others. EVER. You're stuck with one person and one person only for the rest of your life, yourself. If you don't learn to love yourself you'll never understand how someone else can and this will destroy any relationships you have. ""someone prettier/hotter/funnier/whateverer"" is subjective. If he breaks up with you because he thinks he's upgrading or some bullshit then fuck him (but don't actually fuck him), don't waste your time mourning him because you just dodged an asshole sized bullet. (weird phrasing but I'm sticking with it) - Loving yourself goes hand in hand with appreciating yourself and if someone doesn't appreciate you for who you are then they are not worth your time. Being mad at yourself is good (in a self-improvement kind of way). It means you aren't passing the blame to anyone else. You're not playing a victim. You're not in denial. You know your problems are your own and you want to overcome them. That's a step most people don't take because they don't want to be responsible for themselves. Kudos. Since I don't know your relationship I can't really say much to help you on a personal level but you have to remember that he's with YOU. Not someone else who you may think is prettier/hotter/funnier/whateverer. He chose you and you chose him to get closer and more intimate, that counts for A LOT.   You got dis. Good luck. Have fun."

Then, once I started to gain some confidence I worked on the things I didn't like about myself.   Soon enough it all clicked. I started to value myself like crazy. I didn't care if my boyfriend wanted to leave me. Not that he does. Or I'm sure he would have by now lol. I just take it as something I can survive through. I've been through way worse. I can survive a break up if that were to happen at some point. It gives you this sense of inner peace. It's a wonderful feeling."

howtonotgiveafuck,3c7eol,try_stuff,6,Mon Jul 6 05:43:59 2015 UTC,"(From my understanding) The end-goal of howtonotgiveafuck isn't apathy (not giving a fuck about anything), but being able to decide when to give a fuck - or, being able to healthily manage your emotions.  The core of it is being comfortable with one-self. Not falling prey to distracting and unhealthy emotions that give roots to insecurities such as envy or jealousy and to do that you have to move past what it is that makes you feel that way. You gotta look into yourself and figure out what is it that makes you feel inadequate and insufficient and confront those feelings and find ways to overcome them.  It's called How-To-Not-Give-A-Fuck because your fucks are wasted on things that don't matter (insecurities), instead of what does matter (yourself)."

howtonotgiveafuck,3c63go,Vindicated0721,19,Sun Jul 5 04:31:20 2015 UTC,"Not giving a fuck is a product of the man-vs-society conflict.   Anyone who doesn't give a fuck has, at some point, presented his or her self very genuinely to society and has been told that he or she doesn't fit society's norms. Typically, this results in a backlash by the individual. This backlash is often called ""bucking the system. ""  If you'd like to buck the system, you have to first be crushed by society. You need to have that inner man-vs-society conflict. That narrative must become you, and you must become it. This is something that cannot be faked. Not giving-a-fuck is a badge of honor. It is a badge of having the courage to be yourself even when yourself isn't good enough.   Until you step out, tell the world who you truly are and be laughed at---until you rise above loving yourself in spite of what the world thinks, you won't understand what it feels like to truly give no fucks. Not a chance."

You cant achieve your ""I dont give a fuck about the opinions of others"" goal in one giant step.  But you can do it with hundreds (or even thousands) of little steps.  Example of little steps that match your problems:   wear one piece of clothing you really want to wear, instead of a complete outfit tell people about one geeky hobby you have, instead of all the geeky hobbies talk to your friends while there are a few strangers nearby (and increase the numbers with each step) take a day off, then work like you used to, then take a few days off (the work one is a bit hard)   The one on looking good is a nice habit in my opinion. But going out with a shitty look will 'harden your shell' in terms of not giving a fuck.  The more little steps you make the closer you get to achieve your goal and little steps are a lot easier than one or two giant steps.  I hope my advice is of any help to you.

This disregard for mods who run the site and try to keep the subreddits running was the impetus that set up all of the slowly percolating frustration many mods (and users) have had with the admins for quite a while.   A lot of subreddits didn't communicate this effectively which is why the anger of many users is centered around Victoria being fired and the way that Ellen Pao runs the company. Those things are the domain of a private company and we really have no right to have input on those things.  Ultimately, you're right that it is dumb to get worked up about Ellen and Victoria. However, many subreddits weren't protesting those things -- they were protesting the way that the admins treat moderators, subreddits, and users. That just was misconstrued by many users due to poor communication. It still probably isn't something worth getting fired up about for many people who use this site but hopefully it makes a little bit more sense."

Just don't give a shit, you are working to the best of your ability and aren't doing a half ass job. Apart from that yolo that shit.   It's not your dad's company, if you disappear tomorrow will the company stop functioning? Nope.  Just relax and know that no IT project was ever completed in time :)  When I'm on the way home I read books on my kindle to unwind, I sometimes think about what I'm going to do to fix a problem and if there are better approaches, I never stress... It's a creative thought process.   Disclaimer: my advice works well but take it with caution. You still be to have some accountability for your work."

Caveat: be aware of after activity effects. Some things may heighten stress instead of reducing it, like say an adrenaline-pumping multiplayer FPS. Train your mind to put distance between you and your thoughts, i.e. meditation (recommended) or some relaxation exercise. Activities that make you aware of your larger existence. For some this may be spending time on things that matter to them (family, friends, nature, etc), for our it might be spiritual or inspiration reading, or even biographies.   For all of them, take some time to learn how they feel to you after you do them, and after doing them consistently for a period of, say, 2 weeks. This is to find what might work for you.  Hope you find something that works."

I went on stressing until ~ no joke ~ I developed blisters on my retina from the stress.  Yes, that really is a thing.  I had no idea either.  Now I have what might be a permanent blind spot in one eye.  I had to force myself to realize that while short-term it might possibly be in the client's best interests for me to stress too much, and put too much effort in, it's not in anyone's long-term interests.  We all have the right to make our life as healthy and balanced as possible.  Sometimes it is hard, sometimes it feels downright impossible.  But it is necessary.  If you let that stress fester and build, it is destroying your body slowly from the inside out.  Don't wait to fix it until you see the signs of it.  You are smart and creative, and you need to capitalize on those things to give your brain something challenging but non-work-related to do when you get out of work.  Maybe try a new hobby or pick up a new skill. When ideas pop into your head about work, make a quick note and then dismiss it with ""thanks I will tackle that tomorrow""."

One way to think about it is if you constantly go back and continue to do work when nobody is paying you extra, then you are devaluing yourself. That sets a standard for the employer (and other employers at scale) that it's ok and they should keep demanding this workaholism from the workforce. Who wants to live in a world like that?"

Each day try to achieve what is on the chit. This gave me a real view on what I can achieve humanly possible.

howtonotgiveafuck,3c16ql,intellectual_ab,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"There's a natural effect in which walking through a door has a negative impact on memory.  With a bit of awareness and mindfulness, you can use this to your advantage.    In case you have a logical filter in place that starts getting suspicious when woo-woo terms like mindfulness and meditation come out, here's the logical justification for using some of these sorts of mind-hacks:  In any given moment you have a finite amount of physical, mental, emotional, and material resources you can bring to bear to effect change in your environment.  This is your sum total of sentient force.  The only time you can change things is here and now.  Regretting or reminiscing about the past, or worrying or looking forward to the future are both squandering your resources.  If sentient force is your light, being focused in the moment is the difference between a laser and a light bulb.  That said, you are best served by consciously deciding where to spent your sentient force rather than doing it on autopilot.  Start noticing your thoughts and breaking bad habits.  Neurons that fire together wire together, and old neural networks can be broken with stop-thoughts and new associations.  Back to doors - when you walk out of your work, take the time it requires to get from the door of work to the door of your transportation to focus in the moment.  Feel each step of walking, each breath, so totally focus on the experience of the moment you separate yourself from the thoughtspace of work.  Then, as you travel, focus entirely on your travel.  If you're driving, this should be a no-brainer.  No calls or planning or anything else.  Spend time in transit focused on your movement in space.    And then as you walk through the door of your home, feel relaxation hitting you.  Go through a quick relaxation routine and program your brain and body to associate walking through your front door with relaxation.  Let each space be its own, and do not carry things from one room to another.  Leave work at work, drive when you are in your car, and relax while you are at home."
howtonotgiveafuck,3c16ql,talanton,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"First of all you have to ask yourself why you care so much.  Why is work causing such anxiety and apprehension? I find putting things into perspective can help.  Work is a minor worry compared to when you get cardiovascular disease or cancer from all the stress you are causing. You may be working on a big budget game but it's not yours.  It's not your startup or product.  You are just being paid to work for somebody else.   The second thing you can do is to take proper notes and use a todo list system.  GTD or getting things done is very popular.  The goal with any devised system though is to put your thoughts on a medium that's not your mind.  To some that's a notebook and to others it's an app like trello or asana.  Jira is particularly good as well.  The goal though is to context switch fully. When you leave work your notes should be updated and your todo list as well.  You have what you have done and what you need to do and any other notes.   When you leave there's no reason for all of this data to be in your memory anymore because it's written down and you know it is.    When you come into work you should onload the tasks back in and schedule the day.  Then when the day is ending, about a half hour before it's time to stop work and close up your notes and tasks.    Everything I do is in my notes.  My bosses do at times get mad because when they ask me impromptu questions I tell them I don't know. They tell me I should know. I tell them I can find out in just a minute if they like as it's in my notes.  I have been told I have dementia before by my boss. But the truth is I have a mind as clear as a new whiteboard.  I do care about work a lot but it's not beneficial for me to always be stressed.    One other thing is unless you are oncall I suggest you leave your cell phone or work cell phone with your keys.  There's no reason you need your cell phone in the house.  If you get a call you will hear it and if you need to check texts there are many apps for that like mightytext."

I sent a response to a RFP, and I almost had a nervous break down waiting for their decision.  I was irritable all the time, I was making myself ill, and I was unhappy.  Then I realized that I'm hoping to get a LOT more customers.  I am hoping to have actual employees (not just my mother) working for me.  I have big goals, and if I can't make it through one RFP without having a stroke I'm never going to accomplish what I want.  And that's what helped me.  Now when I start to get stressed or obsess about something I think to myself ""This is nothing compared to what I hope to be dealing with next year.  I can handle this.""  Maybe frame it that way and it will be easier to stop obsessing about it?  Look at in terms of what you want for your future, and realize what you're doing now is small potatoes compared to that."

If you get to a good, comfortable stopping point then stop. Use the end of the day to tie off loose ends and seal communications. A lot of stress comes from the non-technical tasks not getting their due time.  Tell the stress sharers to GTFO. Some people deal with stress by broadcasting it around the team like a radio beacon. Tune out, those people are like cancer.  Spend a few minutes doing your mental 'filing'. I adopt a quasi meditative method here. I clear my mind then allow the first 'stress' thought to surface. I then immediately 'file' it as 'done-no longer to be though about', 'ok but nothing you can do about it until tomorrow', or 'ok take action tonight but then put it down'. I repeat until no more thoughts pop up.  When I say 'file' I visualise the issue as a file going into a drawer, then I mentally close it. I may even mentally lock the drawer for a persistent one."

howtonotgiveafuck,3bss8f,downslayer,6,Wed Jul 1 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"It's actually really simple. We avoid feelings. Like you said, feelings don't just go away. We can distract ourselves from them, but eventually, they'll just come back stronger.   Use your instinct. You don't need to understand it. In fact, it's best if you don't try, because that will just lead you in circles around the emotion.  Let it happen. If the emotion is too overwhelming, write, meditate, let yourself cry, but do whatever you can to just let it happen - by that I mean don't try to force anything. See what comes out. Be conscious of your breath and make it long and steady.  Loneliness is a really hard emotion. I've had really rough patches, and no. It never goes away. It's a calling. But it's not external. It comes from inside. Like you said, for unconditional love. Who do you know for a fact that is capable of unconditional love? There is only one person who's feelings you can be certain of. Only one person who you can feel from the inside.   I've made this clearer before, so let me know if you do need someone to talk to. Trust me, I'm good at it, and I love doing it. These emotions are addicting because they're all we have. We are here to feel. That's all we can really do."

Definitely one of society's most addicting and potentially damaging drugs.   The first thing you have to remember is the key is not ""more energy"" or ""more willpower."" It's taking all these pieces of your life, laying them out like a puzzle, and thinking strategically on what parts of ""your life"" you want to work on.   The true ""inner peace"" feeling comes from looking at this puzzle in front of you (even if it includes mental and physical things you want to improve) and saying to yourself, ""NONE of this is me."" Because it's really not. They are all just pieces of the amazing and beautiful universe you are connected too.   But I digress, because that stuff starts to wig people out :P.   Once you have all your pieces of the challenges you are currently facing written down on a sheet of paper, realize that all that shit fits on a piece of paper. You are currently safe, full, generally okay. There's just all this fun stuff to work on. That's kind of empowering, isn't it?  Everyone wants to feel loved, playa. We all just get it in different ways. I suggest thinking of different ways to get love; the best is by giving of course. Your mentality right now (and all of ours, when we get exhausted) is to wonder why no one is paying attention to us. Well, they are kind of thinking the same thing!   Create some cool art. Volunteer. Buy coffee for people and give them high fives. Join community rec leagues filled with old farts who just want to make friends.

My parents were good for providing me with zero guidance and whatever little advice they bestowed upon me turned out to be bad and make my life worse.     Therefore, I've struggled with finding a parent/mentor sort of figure in my life. I wish i could give you advice that would help,  but to be honest,  I'm still trying to figure this out.   I think the advice about getting a pet,  plant and/or hobby is great.   In my past i had a bunch of hobbies which gave my life some meaning and employed me in my free time.    One other thing I can suggest which I'm not sure if someone has said already is going out for a walk, and getting exercise. Go out for a walk to a destination,  like a coffee shop,  and hang out there for a bit.   When I've felt alone, I've done that and just hung out for a while.   You can bring a book, small project,  or your tablet/phone/laptop and do stuff,  but the point is that you're out of your living space.   You don't even have to interact with anyone,  just having activity around you can be good."

It's when you really start to learn about yourself, delve into the things that make you you. People give meaning to your life, but they can also distract you from who you really are. Seriously, you'll look back on this phase one day with gratitude.   That being said, is there no outlet for you to meet people? There's always meetup, you can meet some great people through that. Or bars are always a good way to meet people (if that's your scene). What about your work? Do you meet anyone there?"

I need affection and emotion.  The remedy is simple but hard at the same time - engage in social interactions as much as possible - smalltalks everywhere, small compliments to people around you - like ""hey, nice bag, where did you get it?"". Sometimes these interactions may turn in to friendships, sometimes they just help to dull the loneliness for a while.  Good that you've started in the gym. Squats and deadlifts are of great help as well."

Convincing myself I am okay alone and that I can be happy get's so fucking tiring. I just think sometimes there are people who thrive off of other people and their relationships with them. I am working on fixing that because a lot of people have let me down and I need to learn to rely on myself.   Honestly, when it gets lonely I focus on work, exercising, music, and if I am too tired to be productive- watching a nice movie. Stupid things I know.   But, if you are bored and lonely and need support, just message me honestly because I am probably feeling the same at that moment."

Sure, I've encountered strangers that are vulgar in public (like singing offensive lyrics) but they are all races, if they share anything in common is that they are usually younger folk and are seeking attention of some kind. The stereotype you feel if this relating specifically to black folk isn't one I would relate to as it's not in my experience at all. My city has a huge minority population and I can count on my hand how many times I've heard a black person doing what you say 'blacks people do'.   The reason why she didn't hear you isn't that you weren't loud enough, it was she didn't give a shit what you were doing. She was focused more on her own stuff than the stuff of a stranger. Most folks most of the time are self focused in this way, and I hope knowing that helps any anxiety you have.   Personally I think you should be less concerned about acting our stereotypes that bother you and just do you. I agree about the offensive lyrics though, it's one thing to challenge yourself, it's another to be a deliberate dick by choosing a song to sing in public that is offensive.  You may feel nobody should be bothered by the song, but that doesn't mean folks are not.  Being mindful isn't the same as giving into anxiety."

How not to give a fuck isn't about not giving a fuck about other people or not being considerate.'  Oh OK, because whenever you hear someone singing to themselves you get personally offended rather than just think they're enjoying he selves. Guess you and I disagree in what constitutes being inconsiderate.  'You went into a restaurant, not even a public place, where people were working and talking and trying to enjoy their meal and you basically (attempted) to ruin that.'  Did I? Did I really? I disagree wholeheartedly. I attempted to singly loudly enough to be heard for the duration of one song. That doesn't mean I attempted to bellow in people's ears, just that I wanted to be audible. And FYI I was in a coffee shop not a restaurant. 100% a public place.  'You also used language that some people find rightfully offensive.'  I have no idea what language you're talking about but you see the phrase 'some people'? Whatever you're talking about, look closely at that phrase you've written. You find it offensive but I disagree.  'Sorry, but this is the behavior of a bratty teenager, not a self-possessed man.'  Says you. All you' re doing is misinterpreting the situation and blowing things out of proportion. Singing in public isn't inherently a bad thing. Shouting and screaming yes, singing waaaay too loudly, yes, but singing in and of itself isn't bad so I disagree.  'And what the hell, you posted this girls twitter here? Did she give you permission? Please remove it.'  See, now this is what happens when you leap to conclusions without sufficient evidence. How do you think I got the girl's twitter and why do you think we took the selfie? She knows aaallll about what I'm up to was waiting for me to post the update, you could clearly have assumed that for yourself but you jumped to conclusions for God only knows what reason.  'Edit: if you want to try this challenge for real, go to a street corner and try again.'  Oh I will do this challenge again. I'm gonna do it tomorrow and I probably will go to a street corner, but you know what else I'm gonna go? Head straight back to that coffee shop. Please stop reading if that offends you,"

Everyday on the subway people roll their eyes when some loser feels their desire to sing along trumps everyone else's to not hear the warbling.

If you were in a coffee shop and saw 2 friends singing Lady Gaga at a reasonable volume, you wouldn't give a damn,  'And you were trying to be loud. You ended your post saying you were going to try to be louder. You were bummed when you weren't heard.'  Yes because I wanted to be heard. Literally. Heard. Being heard singing in public is an issue for me. It's not hard to work out. So yes, tomorrow I'm going to be louder so I'm heard. If people sat 2 feet away can't even hear me then I'm not loud enough.   'Do you not know how shitty it sounds to others when you sing along to music only you can hear? Everyday on the subway people roll their eyes when some loser feels their desire to sing along trumps everyone else's to not hear the warbling.'  To be honest, it's not something I ever see except for when people are drunk and it doesn't bother me hen. I once heard a group of drunk white guys singing the whole lyrics to 8 mile by eminem on the train. I found it hilarious.  'And you sat right down with people who were working. What the fuck, you seem to have zero sense of etiquette.'  Technically it was one person, but let's play your game for a second. Assuming I gave that girl the worst experience of her life (and she really enjoyed our interaction btw). She'd have endured it for literally 60 seconds. Try to remember the part where I said I sat down with 75% of the song done.  'A coffee shop, or a restaurant like pret, are not public places. They are privately owned and people spent money to be there.'  OK  'And I didn't make assumptions, I ASKED if you got permission. That is the opposite of assumption, but you still didn't answer if she knew you were going to post her Twitter.'  No you did. Which is why you told me to take her handle down. You've decided that you're against me and are looking for ways to prove me wrong. Also I said she knows exactly what I'm doing. That literally means that she knew I was goi to put this post up with her Twitter handle. She's probably reading this now and laughing at you.  And I don't think you know what ""offend"" means. It doesn't offend me. How could it? But you are a selfish jerk for it.  Thanks for reading and thanks for being so vocal in your dislike of me and what I'm doing. People like you give me the fuel I need to get to where I want to be in life. Have a lovely day and a fantastic existence."

You'd have spent 60 seconds of your life being annoyed that someone was singing and wouldn't have been able to let it go.  The fact is that anything in life is going to annoy somebody. I've seen people singing out and about and found it hilarious, you find it annoying. That's life. I could approach a woman tomorrow and ask for her number and she could either think I'm the hottest man on earth and love the fact I asked her, or she could be a rape victim who's triggered by the fact at I look like her rapist and could have her whole week ruined by the same interaction that the first woman loved.

howtonotgiveafuck,3bhsqn,BsodIRL,12,Mon Jun 29 09:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that your friends and fiancée treated you so awfully. All I can say is that: I think it's helpful to think of friendships and relationships transactionally. What are you getting out of them, and what are they getting out of you? There always has to be that balance. For example, if you need help with some problem and unburden on your friend once in a while, then that's okay so long as you don't do it too often, and are willing to listen to their problems and help them out as well.  The problem comes when there's an imbalance: one person is giving all, and the other is taking and not giving anything back. This sounds like your situation; maybe this is an aspect of your personality, that you don't want to speak up for yourself, or perhaps you got landed with a circle of friends who found out that they can take from you and not be expected to give much back. Either way, I would gently recommend that you reevaluate that circle.  I keep the balance by cutting the people out of my life who don't give a fuck about me. Because, what's the point if I'm giving and getting nothing in return? It sounds harsh and callous to talk about people like this, but I think you have to be pragmatic: you need to consider your own emotional and mental health, and giving someone a lot of time and energy without getting anything for it can really drag you down. So delete everyone on your Facebook friends list (if you have Facebook,) and see who adds you back, or just delete the people you've never spoken a word to, or the people who give you bullshit. You have the right to your own emotional wellbeing, and when people are threatening to take that away from you, then that's their problem, not yours, and you don't need those people in your life.  And seek out positive relationships: look for the people who will spend time with you, will listen to you, will respect you for who you are, and invest time and emotions in them.  Tl;dr: Keep the balance. Cut the people you don't care about, and the people who don't care about you."

howtonotgiveafuck,3bhsqn,Eze-Wong,12,Mon Jun 29 11:15:37 2015 UTC,"I think most people on DGAF suffer from this ""complex"". The complex being self sacrifice. It usually comes out of overbearing pressure to conform. And people often relent their own needs because in their minds the higher good is to sacrifice themselves for another.   Theres a good way to test this on yourself. Ask ""would I give my life up to save a bus full of burning children? Then how about your wife? Or maybe just another person?"" If you answered yes you suffer from overwhelming white knight self subjugation (aka nice guy syndrome).   A lot of people develop it because society and media make self sacrificing heroes into big virtues. The  the 8 year old boy who died saving his family for example. What makes it so tragic is that the boy himself was probably the one who was the most needed in being saved.   And thats where people develop issue.  White knight nice guys are always trying to do the higher good and 99% of the time its self sacrificing. What ive noticed about... ""alpha males"" (and im cringing while i use the term) is that if and when they do self sacrifice it will ultimately be appreciated. But what many white knights do is sacrifice themselves for things that will never be recognized. For example, I spent 2 days making a ""romantic box"" full of mushy crap for my ex (i cringe hard when i flashack to that time). She barely looked inside and then set it aside. I became mad at her because I expected a loving response. I faulted on many aspects of the relationship but mostly because the relationship although focused on me giving to her sounds great.... couldnt be sustained because my self sacrifices were uncessary.   For example, i could have just as easily taken her out to a nice dinner and taken selfies for her to post on facebook. The calue and worth for social media idiots like ourselves woild have resulted in net benefits for both of us. But what I choose was a win ~ lose situation. Nice guys do this a lot. They internalize that doing something nice isnt good unless there is some suffering or sacrifice involved.   Im not saying you are exactly like this OP but it does seem you have some tenets of it.   Lastly if you truly give 0 fucks... you might end up like me. Alone. Very very alone. Its okay but nit ezactly rhe happiest existence. I think if I could improve my relationships I would have thought of more scenarios where everyone wins. But I often only contemplated ideas that made the other person happy... which inevitably caused hidden spite and self sabotaged the relationship."

And there are times that I know I shouldn't but do it anyway even when no one has asked. Those specific instances are absolutely my fault alone.

Like I got this impression of him that he seemed so needy, especially when he approached multiple girls and he's like, oh I can't have yours, and then he looked at the other girl, can I have yours then? Seemed kind of insensitive, I'm surprised even 5 girls agreed"
howtonotgiveafuck,3bbzif,uhasnicelegs,10,Sat Jun 27 20:13:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that he's trying to get over his approach anxiety, but he could have just as well said hi and made conversation for like two minutes.

howtonotgiveafuck,3bbzif,uhasnicelegs,4,Sun Jun 28 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really great to watch. I think 4 of the 5 'yes' girls were in the second half of the 100 he asked.   A few times he stopped to actually ask the girl why, and sometimes they told him, and he naturally got better at it. The last girl to say yes even said ""you're really brave"", but we know he's been asking girls and getting more confident the whole time.  Indeed you can know how to overcome anxiety intellectually, but it is an emotional problem, and emotional problems are best dealt with through action, which I think he demonstrated. He showed that in order to not be affected by adverse situations, you have to put yourself into adverse situations of lesser consequence, so it's not as difficult when you face the real challenge. A bit like how vaccinations work, or any other training.  I'll bet out of the next 100 girls he asks, far more than 5 will say yes, since he's learned so much during the first 100. Now that he has little anxiety approaching girls, being more sensitive, or stoic, is a lot easier."

Just keep in mind that most people who go around accusing other people of being fake or shallow are probably just projecting their own insecurities about being fake and shallow.   NGAF does require practice and you have to kind of rewire your thought process. There's nothing fake about practicing a new thought pattern. You need to internalize the idea that you aren't your thoughts. Let me say that again because it's key: you aren't your thoughts. Your thoughts have been instilled in to you by culture, your family and friends, your experiences, but they aren't you, and learning how to change them doesn't make you fake."

It's a feedback loop, and the idea is to cut the ""loop"".   This so very much. It sounds disingenous at first, but it really does help to act, or behave, as if something doesn't bother you. You have to back it up with that essential pattern breaking that /u/RPSigmaStigma mentioned.  So, you recognize the pattern and stop one part of it--the part where you publicly linger and dwell on the instance. As you notice more of these instances, you can become more aware of your own negative and positive thought loops.  As you recognize them (and it can be scary when you finally realize how frequently you cram your head fully of negative and self hatred), you can begin to employ various strategies to help overcome the thoughts and to think differently.   But really, just catching yourself in the act is huge. And the brain is a funny thing - I'm sure you've heard about the studies that show when people smile, stand taller, stand arms akimbo, etc, that they actual do start to feel better and more empowered.   It's baby steps for me, but they work more often than they don't. Good luck, OP."
howtonotgiveafuck,3basb7,Skycakes,7,Sat Jun 27 19:58:35 2015 UTC,Not giving a fuck is about learning how to deal with uncomfortable feelings that arise while you are doing the things you want to do. Here's an example: a guy gives a fuck about people seeing him at the beach with his shirt off. He wants to just go to the beach to have a good time. So he goes and takes his shirt off. At first it's uncomfortable but he makes room for that feeling. Soon he realizes that no one really cares and he forgets about it and has a blast in the sun at the beach. That's what this is all about- doing what you truly want to do and just dealing with the uncomfortable feelings as they arise. You're never going to be numb to being uncomfortable about things. You just need to learn to ignore them.

Therefore by saying to yourself that the ""normal"" you should be freaking out, you're subconsciously telling your ""present"" self that it's not right that you're not freaking out and that you actually should be. And this could result in bringing you down, back to what you subconsciously think the ""normal"" you should be doing.    I was suggesting that if this is true, you would benefit from identifying this thought and letting it go. So now what you previously referred to as the ""normal"" you, becomes the ""past"" you. And the ""present"" you now becomes the ""normal"" you."

Well, I only said it because I feel like the new me is ""normal"" and I'm glad I'm not freaking out like the old me, that's all.

Why do you gain such significant meaning or validation from external sources? Why is your happiness directly related to how you interact with others?  You can't really move forward until you know your path. You have your destination in mind; to be free of your own emotional storm. But you need to know why your interactions with others defines your happiness and work on solving the root of your problem.  Only then can you start moving forward."

Hmmm well yes, I'll have to dig down to the issues at the real bottom but I am not sure if I could do that alone? (Been thinking about going to therapy but just paying for something that might be possible to fix myself is a bit off-putting).   I believe it started with my upbringing (trying to please everyone and caring what others though about me) and since moving from my home to a university in a different country, I have only myself and a couple friends/family members I keep in touch with online, so really it comes down to security of their presence... Honestly I have no idea what I am going to be doing 12 months from now, absolutely none, and the people act like a constant that I can rely on.... so that is probably it. And  for that reason I place so much importance on their presence in my life as they are basically the fundamentals that are holding me up. I should probably develop a stronger base to support myself rather than rely on others but it's just I've always had someone there for me, to help me or offer encouragement and it's difficult to let go of that.... but I sort of see the problems now. Thank you, I will try to see if I can work based off that and become someone more independent!"

When your happiness is linked to someone else, you can never be happy alone.  You should really look within and find out what makes you happy.

I haven't been in a serious relationship in 3 years. I date on and off, but usually end things before getting serious. Some people think it's weird. Those people are usually in relationships and think that life is only good while you're sharing it with someone. While love is an amazing thing to experience, you can wait.

howtonotgiveafuck,3axfzo,zachochee,34,Wed Jun 24 07:34:06 2015 UTC,Get better friends.  If they are genuinely talking shit about you when you leave they aren't worth your time. Real friends will confront you if they have an issue with your actions. People who say mean shit behind your back probably have their own insecurities that they are trying to hide by directing attention towards something else (you in this case).  Don't waste your time and stress on them.
howtonotgiveafuck,3axfzo,PirateOwl,12,Wed Jun 24 09:37:22 2015 UTC,"It's inevitable facet of having friends. My best friend of 20 years started talking shit about me, and I knew it. I was devastated. We did everything together. High school, College, and even we roomed together post college.   But then again, I realize I talk shit about him too. So this lead me to believe I was being a hypocrite.  We all talk shit, but we don't always do it because we genuinely hate that person. We do it because it's fun or we have nothing else to do.   Don't view friendship as this everlasting bond of someone who will have your back through thick and thin. Hell... families aren't even that close or are willing to do that much.   Friends are temporary alliances based on locality, common interests, and trading. That's it. They aren't these magical invisible lines that tie people together.   Most likely those friends talk shit about other people too. Behind their backs. There isn't a person who doesn't talk shit behind someones back. And even if they don't they probably think it... but just don't say it.  Honestly look at your group of friends. How many times have you either thought of shit, or talked shit about them? And if you haven't... given the opportunity you WILL most likely talk shit.  I've seen tons of best buddies talk shit as soon as a hot girl enters the room. Girls are the same, if they are competing for some guy they will stab her faster than freddy kreuger during a power nap. In fact, I broke up a couple of best friends because they were both competing for me. (Which I'll never really understand why they liked me in the first place LOL)."

howtonotgiveafuck,3axfzo,Shiloh788,6,Wed Jun 24 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"I had this with family. Had them over for a bbq and as they were eating meat that took me  6 hrs to smoke they talked trash about me to my friends.   I heard them from through the kitchen window and my friends looked very uncomfortable.  This is why I have no family but my daughter anymore.  I realized how toxic my relationship with them was and feel better for lysing the connection.  I feel sad that I had to do that but it was a big contribution to the very depression they were complaining about.  Hearing someone comment how crappy you are while stuffing their faces with food you lovingly prepared for them is a real eye opener.  You will feel bad for a while, but then the weight of their non acceptance will lift off your mind, and you can feel the freedom of not being judged in everything you do.       This was not a one time event, I had put up with the pain of not conforming to their idea of what my life should be like for 45 yrs,  because it is hard to make that decision to cut ties with family, but it had been toxic for too long.  Save your self esteem and ditch them before you start believing you're as bad as they say you are."

That said, most people won't start talking about someone right after they've left the room unless 1) they're immature (my guess) or 2) you're a douchebag that just said something awful.

How does that affect you in any way? People moan about their friends, their family, their spouses, everyone. It really doesn't mean they don't like them, but sometimes they need to say it to validate their feelings or get an ego boost. That's 100% their problem, not yours. If they say it behind your back, they don't want you to hear, meaning they want to look better. If anything, it says more about them than it does about you. It's great to stand up for yourself but the only person you need to do it for is yourself, because that's the only opinion with any real merit.   You don't have to cut them out but maybe take up a new hobby and find nicer people.   You just have to look at what all these people say, inside and outside your head, look at it straight on and see if there's anything you can turn into a positive action.

howtonotgiveafuck,3askyv,melodicprophet,97,Tue Jun 23 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"Mate, there are a lot of great answers out there, so I will keep mine short.   I will share with you what my therapist told me a few years back. It took a while to sink in, but I am slowly internalizing it. It doesn't necessarily have to take that long, but I had other issues to take care of, and everything comes when the time is right. You seem to be able to reflect upon yourself in a cool-headed manner, and to generally be in control of your own life, so I think you can make use of this a lot quicker and more consistently.   Essentially you have it figured out. It starts with this realization. You convince yourself you are in love with a girl because she shows you the attention you have been craving for so long. I feel your analyzis is correct, at least it echoes what I have been dealing with.   Good news is, you have done most of the work already. The next step is to identify this thought pattern as it arises. A girl is nice to you, gives you a cookie, tells you something that makes you feel good. Take a deep breath. You feel something. Take an even deeper breath, breathe deep into your core. Is this feeling really love? Can it even be? No. Are you attracted to her? Does this fact that she is being decent to you right now means she will always be there for you an provide comfort? Obviously not, at least you cannot know that at this point.   All these are just a projection of your own craving. She is not the person in front of you, she becomes the embodiment of your own deep insecurities. Think again. Enjoy the gesture. Move on.   As long as you identify the pattern, allow it to take place but analyze it rationally and accept it for what it is, i.e. a projection of your own need, you will find that this person is definitely not what you make her to be, at least not at that point. In my experience a loving, nurturing relationship can only arise with time, energy and a deep connection. You should not seek it or project it, but only allow it to happen with time. By making her into something she is not, you are disrespecting yourself and putting an undue burden onto her. This could very well torpedo a promising start, since she cannot possibly live up to your expectations this fast, and neither can you. This is however a blessing in disguise, since it will prevent you from wasting years of your life with a person who is not who you made her up to be, and who might very well make you miserable as fuck.    Bottomline is, you know you are indulging in a nice comforting narrative, so when you recognize it it loses its power and allows you to move on. The more you will practice this and keep a cool head, the less power it will hold over you.   EDIT: so much for being short"

I project the things I want to see into them when that really isn't them at all. I have no right to be hurt when I barely know them and am not a part of their lives. I even realized I do this, and sometimes still do it all anyways. I have to kick myself and make myself see it for what it really is.

Now I am by no means done with this, but I feel heaps more sure of myself, I no longer seek validation or some sort of meaning to my life, because I know this is all weak bs I was telling myself, the only meaning that matters is the one I create.

howtonotgiveafuck,3askyv,Eze-Wong,121,Fri Jun 26 22:46:48 2015 UTC,"LOL.  Before I was clicked on the link and read the thread I was thinking. ""Hmm He's probably like me, his mother must have abandoned him so he's looking for nurturing from another source like I do.""  I'm similar and the only girls I've dated are the ones who have paid attention to me in some way. IN fact, the very first girl I had a crush on, I remember well only because she had done something nice for me. It wasn't because she was hot, or popular (although she was), but it was because she gave me a cookie or something like that.  I was abandoned by my mother when I was a toddler. I never received the nurturing from my father. And I've always noticed a pattern of what kind of woman I wanted. 99% of the times she fulfills my idea of a good mother. Good cook, kind, caring, sweet, a little on the chubby side maybe, etc.  It's pretty normal, but I stopped giving a fuck about 3 years ago. How to get there is difficult but you don't really have to try to achieve it.   People are just people, they can't give you anything. Emotional attachment is looking outside yourself to fulfill some need. I used to be dependent on other people for reassurement. I needed someone to tell me how good, smart, nice, kind, and wonderful I was. If I didn't receive compliments then I couldn't believe these things about myself. When you stop looking for validation outside yourself, you realize that the only validation you need is internally. Once that happens you can start building this ""ecosystem"" of internal sufficiency. People say we need each other, but you really don't. You don't need anything to feel safe, comfortable and great.   We are born needing the comfort of our parents, but that also makes us weak. I had to work really hard to become self sufficient and stop needing people for everything. I no longer lean on anything emotionally to keep me going. If someone says ""Hey ____ you're handsome"". I don't let it get to me. Likewise someone tells me I'm ugly as fuck. I also don't let it get to me.   For every opinion someone has about me, I think of them rolling a dice and choosing what to say. Their opinions reflect who THEY are. Not who I am.  Once you realize that opinions don't reflect you or what you're about at all, then you can start to work past it.  Kind of weird and nonsensical but I gotta go to work, lol if I have time I'll edit this to make sense.   EDIT: Brofist for the gold."
howtonotgiveafuck,3askyv,Eze-Wong,23,Tue Jun 23 05:22:58 2015 UTC,"I think what is strange is that I don't neccessarily crave attention. I crave connection.  I get plenty of attention and it doesn't do much for me. And truly, most people's opinions don't affect me at all.  But when I see good in someone and want to connect further, it bums me out when they don't reciprocate. Or worse, if I suspect that they are deliberately suppressing that part of themselves out of fear.  I have no fear of being hurt.   I am fearful that I am way too preoccupied with trying to connect to others. So much so that I am putting off my own life."

howtonotgiveafuck,3askyv,Mynotoar,17,Tue Jun 23 07:39:46 2015 UTC,"Being jaded helps a lot. I know, it sounds negative but in the grand scheme of things... looking for everlasting friendship just doesnt seem to exist. Most times it seems situational. And even like ""ideal"" families behind closed doors have their own issues. Being able to see the flaws of the positive. And the pros of the negative has helped a lot with the neediness.   For example, this one time i was at a club dancing (by myself mind you) and this girl turns around assumes im hitting on her and gives me this disgusted look. At the time it ruined my night. I got over it because i started to realize that not everyone would have reacted as she did. Her life experiences formed the reaction she made. Anyone else could have laughed at me, ignored me, or even wanted to hook up and make babies.   The real reason I was upset was because i thought her opinion was a reflection of myself. That i was ""bad"" in some way. When i realized her reaction was not a reflection of me, but of her, it helped alleviate that situational dependency of her opinion.  Hmmm to put perspective on it... we all grow up learning from others about ourselves. This is a common theme in psychology about the self reflective ego. We look to others to affirm what we think. For example beautiful girls go out and know they are hot. When one person denies or acts incongruent to her belief they get angry, apologetic or even try to change their mind. Our idenity is a often part of our world and we depend on others to fufilll that need.   So anyways ultimately, thos idea of a caring girl has always been something i wanted. A chubby julia childesque manifestation of oedipus syndrome I wanted was a result of my need to be ""safe"". A deep hurt child lurked and waited for that comfort he mever had. But thats because i thought I needed it. When i realized that i dont need those things... or that in some way its also repulsive, i stopped depending on women to assure me that im loveable. I was recreating scenarios where mommy could come back to me, hug me and say she loved me. Daddy issues exist but so do mommy issues.   So yeah. I now dont even go out most times and spend most my time alone. That seems depressing but for a guy who always needed compliments from others it was a big step to independence."

And whenever other people, besides those I was sexually attracted to, would show me attention I would latch onto them in a similar way. I'm still learning to have healthy relationships in my life.

I don't think the need/desire to be accepted and loved is exceptional to myself or indicative of mental disturbance.   I personally extract much more out of a pool of responses that have a wide range. From tough love, compassion, to making my post into a joke. They are all helpful perspectives.   And I am honestly feeling much better. I have a lot of interests and a lot of things going for me. I've been running from them and while doing so; hoping to accidentally run into the arms of someone who will shield me from my deepest fears.   But I've always known deep down that such a dream is not my real dream. It's a lesser dream. The desire to have someone accept me for LESS than I am...because I am too scared to be all that I really am.   I see now (in large thanks to this thread) that I am only hurting myself. And that placing such an expectation on anyone will only lead to ruin...if not because of the pressure on them, the inherent flaw: My own shame and anxiety from not pursuing my real dreams will drown the relationship.   Say what you will, but I am very glad I made this thread. I'm feeling focused and have regained perspective on some relationships in my life."

Any relationship that exists on that premise will eventually end in ruin because no one can perfectly protect you. You will put a lot of stock in them and they will do something that you will perceive as them failing you and you'll blame them for it. That's not love. That's an unhealthy dependency which developed because a parent never taught you how to be an adult. Only way for you to fix that is to realize 1. You're capable, 2. People want you to do well, 3. Relationships are there to mutually enjoy and not just from your side. But again, I don't know you. This might not be you. This is just a really superficial interpretation of what you wrote."

It's proven to make me quite happy as I still connect and spend time with them.  The important factor for me is that I'm only investing my friendship in them. I love and care about all my friendships deeply but at the end of the day I'm living for me. Not everything I do makes everyone I know happy but my friends know how I am and accept me for who I am. Those who vocalize a specific issue get my attention and consideration about what's bothering them and those who leave I stop caring about.  Basically I think you can invest yourself in people in an unromantic way while still getting satisfaction and genuine friendship.

The general pick yourself up, think positive and do it yourself attitude around here is great for most of life's small problems, but this sounds deeper. The way I see it, self help is great if I have a cold or I got poison ivy on me, but if I think I broke my arm I'd go to the doctor.   If your financial situation doesn't allow for it, try talking to a religious or a community leader who has experience speaking with people about these things. I would actually not recommend seeking that kind of counsel from family or friends, I think the outsider opinion is important and they won't have any stake in the matter to distract from helping you.

And some of us have them for awhile and lose them whether because it's our doing or someone else's or just life.  I'm amused by this need by humans. Well, I know animals do, too. I'm amused that we get hurt by this need.  Sometimes, I think I'd rather have this, and the hurt that comes with it,  than to feel nothing. I've learned to appreciate having it.  If you can step outside of yourself and observe yourself when the pain comes, I think it might help.  Maybe look at the mirror to see yourself.  Your want and need, and the hurt that comes with them, are within you. It has nothing to do with someone else. They're just passing by.  I think we're like containers of various stuff.  Every so often, something or someone passes by causing the shakeup. Neither the thing or the person can remove anything from the container."

If a guy is talking to me because he thinks I'm attractive, that makes me uninterested in him, because the dude just wants my body, he doesn't want me because he doesn't know me.

Tons of men lose their virginity between 20-25. In my freshman college dorm, maybe half of us were virgins. I lost mine at 21. There's literally not even one single reason you should give a fuck. You're young. There's nothing wrong with you. It'll happen. Focus on using your fucks for interesting things that matter."

I mean, daily I get messages from 24, 25, 26 year old guys who are employed, handsome, charming and virgins because the right connection hasn't happened yet. It can seem incredibly lonely and isolating when it feels like all your friends are dating (my first kiss was at 19 so I definitely remember the feeling), but it's so important to keep things in perspective. Somewhere around mid-twenties is probably the drop off point where most people seem to have had sex. And honestly, you'll enjoy it a lot more at 19 or 20 without the drama of 17 year old girls, ha!"

I lost mine at 18, freshman year of college to the wrong girl and I highly regret it, because at the time I was so obsessed with achieving the social status of losing ones v-card. That girl was the wrong girl and I regret losing something so special to her. If I could I'd go back and wait longer for the right person. Don't give a fuck about losing your virginity for the sake of losing it. Instead, be proud you haven't made the mistake of losing it to the wrong person like I did. Wait and find the right person to lose it to, and it'll be that much better."

Self worth and happiness can not be dependent upon other people, what they do or think, how they react to you.   No one owes you their time. Life doesn't resemble media.   Try not thinking about people when you aren't with them. Throw all of your efforts into doing something, making something, learning something, creating something, practicing something, working, resting, jerking off, whatever.   You can always sell your own phone number and email to spammers if you want your phone to be ringing off the hook.   If you need to be needed, then seek out people who really need help. Volunteer.

Jerking off can help protect against prostate cancer, there was a TIL post about it a few days ago. Prostate cancer is an awful way to die. Killed one of my favorite comic book writers, Harvey Pekar, and then it killed my dad. I knew Harvey Pekar had a vasectomy because he wrote about it in American Splendor. My dad could never catch a break, never rest, he was over worked and over stressed, and my mom is a gold digging she-beast so no help from her.   Jerking off is like male menstruation, just unfairly fun (imagine your balls are in your lower back and they rip away from the inside of your nutsack then dribble out of your dick for a week uncontrollably, you wouldn't put up with anyone's shit either). Both genders are constantly producing new cells in the reproductive organs, and if they don't clear out regularly they go rancid.    When I can't fuck, nothing makes me happier then seeing my dude beating off while watching porn and playing MtG online because I know it'll help him to avoid a painful death.

Another is to get into 3D printing and modeling 3D files, this requires tools but is apartment friendly.   I got into 3D stuff. I don't know anything about engines except, I did learn all about fuel injectors randomly from a friend's dad one christmas. The dad was bothering his adult kid but not enough to be considered a terror, he was just being nitpicky. The dad worked for a European car company in the 1970s-80s. So, he talked to me all about fuel injectors and he chilled out with the nitpicking. I found his old patents that had expired and modeled a fuel injector he designed while he was talking to me.  Patents expire so that you can learn from them. The only reason why I don't know more about engines is I haven't pursued teaching myself more about them.    this will take years   Choose 2/3 for the expense of the remaining: Good. Fast. Cheap."

You are the most important person in your own life so making yourself happy should be important. If keeping up with people in the social media world stresses you out then don't do it and if they don't keep up with you or show interest then they might not be the best people to keep company with. I'm only a couple of years removed from high school and I understand that struggle.

You may just be a person who gets his/her self worth from constant social interaction. Maybe in times of no social interaction find something to supplement the loneliness. This could be an activity that betters yourself and makes you a more likable person. Or maybe organize something that would attract other people, like a concert event, sports tournament, 5k. Maybe look into something entrepreneurial that would attract people, like opening a bar or restaurant.  That's just my personal suggestions. I may be way off at assessing your personality type and personal needs.   Edit: realized that you're 17 and can't do any of the entrepreneurial things I suggested. Maybe look into working at a restaurant. Also, if you plan to go to college, you may enjoy being in a fraternity."

Chances are, you probably won't see a majority of your friends since they will be going to different colleges.  In college, you will make friends and the same thing is going to happen, they will start to disappear. You have to remember that other people don't think of you as the center of the universe. They have their own life to live, and so do you.  Your self worth is determined by you and not by anyone else. As you age, people start talking to you less, especially friends who are getting married or have boyfriends/girlfriends.  Thus, do something with your life. Build something. Read something. Always try to improve yourself and determine what you are worth; not by other people's standards, but by yours."

It seems like work to find so much rejection, but I like that you're trying to do more than just ask girls out. You're putting yourself out there in ways that you most likely wouldn't have otherwise.   A thought: This has me thinking about shame and being a humble person. No one is seeking you. You're now seeking them. The 'who' doesn't matter right now. I feel like many of us live in this dream where we act like people want me and being needlessly picky about what we're exposed to. Most of us aren't remotely in that position to do such. If you're in a position of higher status (wealth, power, fame), people seek you out. Most of us are not, but we act like it. At least to ourselves and that effects our outward expressions. The most truly successful people tend to have the ability to be humble, work diligently, and keep their head up.

Neither the past or future exist, at all.  At best you have extremely, one-sided versions of the past that do not comport with what actually happened.  Once you get with the fact that you don't know what actually happened and you have no access to the past, then it will just float away.  Your mind uses memories of the past to keep you safe.  Your mind does not use these memories to make you happy.  It's all about survival, but in these modern times, most of the events the brain evolved to react to don't exist anymore, so it latches onto any perceived threat.  It's all illusions though.  Your mind is creating illusions of threat that it knows you will believe, so that you will act accordingly, keeping you safe.  But feeling and thoughts have no intrinsic meaning."

You're not going to be able to hold it forever and it's going to blast out in a spectacular way. Just feel your feelings and make room for them.

It takes a long time and it's much more difficult than you'd think, but it is something you can change.  You can get yourself into a pattern where all your thoughts are consumed with regrets and you live in constant guilt. And, if you're anything like me, you can do it so long and so well that you forget that you were ever even capable of doing anything else. It becomes your default, and despite the anxiety and depression that causes, it becomes more comfortable than the alternative.  You're not learning how to let things go and live without the fear and guilt of regret. You're remembering. So you have to practice it. You have to do it even though it feels worse than you already feel. You have to sit with it and catch yourself when you do it and tell yourself not to. You have to do it until your default becomes uncomfortable too, which is going to feel even worse.  But eventually, gradually, it starts leaning the other way. The regret hits you second rather than first, and that feels very weird when you notice it. And as you keep practicing, it gets weaker and weaker until it stops happening most of the time.  And then you just keep doing it. Which you already know how to do. The result will just be better this time."

It's usually a good idea to obey at least some of the laws where you live in order to maximize the amount of fun that can be had in a lifetime. Sometimes laws/rules can be chill.   Rules about which fork to use are bullshit.   Rules about wearing safety goggles are, imo, pretty cool.    Wear white shoes all year if you want.   Try to break gravity and the earth will hit you hard.   Play grand theft auto for real in Los Angeles and the police will hit you hard.   There's no rule requiring phone ownership or that texts be responded to.    I sleep in a nest on the floor, eat soup for breakfast, I never call my mom or accept her calls because I don't have to and don't want to, I brush my teeth more then twice a day, I'll wear the same clothes for more then 2 days in a row if they're still clean. Sometimes I'll just eat cake for dinner. I talk to strangers. I use marijuana but abstain from alcohol. I'm a pro-military liberal. Monogamous Satanist.   I live a happy life because I don't always do what people told me I'm supposed to do.   I have a rebellious spirit because it kept me alive and safe, but I've never even had a parking ticket or speeding ticket.   There's no rule requiring me to have a point to all of this other then I'm stoned and like the way typing feels when I'm high.   I don't give a fuck if people read what I write."

howtonotgiveafuck,3a50u8,Be-Bop-Brew,3,Thu Jun 18 00:48:01 2015 UTC,"Happiness is good buddies with Safety but a group of Rules is always following Safety around like creepy assholes. When Happiness needs to take out Rules with a grenade launcher, all too often Safety ends up in the crossfire and dies too. Happiness then dies of grief and an asshole named Sadness takes over. Life isn't the same when that guy is in charge.   Often times it seems like the really heavy artillery is needed because some Rules just don't seem to die. But, they draw their strength from attention. Old Rules die quite deaths when everyone stops paying attention to them.   Turn away from the Old Rules or go to a new place for a while with different Rules. In a short time some Old Rules will die off.   With less Rules bothering Happiness and Safety, you can more easily pick off the specific Rules that are bothering them and just keep the good ones.   Eventually all that's left is Happiness, Safety and small but manageable group of Rules that enhance life for both Happiness and Safety.   Rules are like feral cats."

Solve. Thank. These people aren't mad at you, they just need to vent. So listen, don't try and interrupt, don't try to solve the problem, even if they are barking up the wrong tree. Apologize, even though you didn't do anything wrong. Tell them you're sorry they had to deal with their problem (even if it's fucking stupid, it usually is). Solve the problem or send them to the proper channels. Then thank them for the opportunity to help them. If you can think of it as a more remote thing it won't bother you so much."

howtonotgiveafuck,3a65gu,OneRedSent,4,Tue Jun 23 06:14:44 2015 UTC,"I've been dealing with angry customers for over 8 years now, and now rarely does someone being upset bother me.  To be honest it's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what action I took, because it's not just one thing, at least in my experience.    One aspect is that through repetition, and the more customers you help, patterns in their behavior start to emerge. Then you can start to anticipate what's going to happen, which gives you more control, or at least more comfort.   Another thing that happens is that I try to see the humor in the situation that's happening, while its happening.  I think about things like how it's going to be a great story to tell later on.  It helps you keep your cool.  Obviously this can backfire, so you have to control your expresses and body language.   Speaking of body language, huge factor.  Sometimes I observe my fellow co workers in my job at times when they're in a difficult customer interaction.  I can see the stress written all over their face.  People feed off that, because it shows that you're afraid.  It becomes more difficult to control the situation.  I try to make sure that my facial expression at all times during an interaction reads ""This is not a big deal to me.""   Back in the days when I was taking it personally, in my rookie days, I remember thinking and agonizing about it later on for the next few days, during which I would think of alternate scenarios that could have happened if I had said something different at certain points.   I haven't done that in a while.  I suppose that goes under the umbrella of experience. Experience is the best teacher...somebody famous said that."
howtonotgiveafuck,3a65gu,IlIlIlIIllIIll,2,Thu Jun 18 17:42:29 2015 UTC,Solid advice. I think listening but just giving off the body language that I'm not bothered will help me to be able to not take it personally. I'll give this a try and see how it goes!

howtonotgiveafuck,39ym00,onda-oegat,17,Mon Jun 15 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"I think there is intrinsic good to this philosophy when it is applied in an appropriate manner. I hold that not giving a fuck is actually a stripped down, modernized, tongue-in-cheek reformulation of Buddhism's tenets regarding suffering and acceptance. Giving a fuck, i.e. allowing your illogical emotional responses to particular events that are beyond your control to dictate your experience of reality and your behaviors, is almost never beneficial in any situation.   It is not helpful to panic when someone is having a medical emergency. It is not sensible to cringe several hours later over that stupid and embarrassing thing that slipped out of your mouth at the office earlier in the day. It does not help to scream obscenities at your dog because it woke up at 3am and decided to diarrhea-shit all over your work shoes. It is not helpful to sit in your dark bedroom for several weeks eating Andy Caps Hot Fries™ and posting to /r/birdswitharms because you are depressed over a recent failed relationship. It will not improve your situation to cry and cower in the face of death.  The best way to deal with all of these situations is to detach yourself. Step back, clear your mind, and say to yourself ""Fuck it. Shit happens. The best thing I can do about this situation is..."" By engaging in the not giving a fuck way of life you are making a conscious effort to clear your mind of the sort of unhelpful clutter that does jack shit to improve the situation and only serves to cloud your judgement and reasoning abilities.   That's not to say that someone can go through life not giving a fuck about everything. Simply understanding the philosophy and it's benefits then doing everything your power to apply it as needed can be helpful. It can help you gain composure and perspective. It is a powerful tool to have in your arsenal in the daily fight against bullshit, and you may stand to gain much from practicing it and improving your ""fuck it"" technique.  To better understand this age-old philosophy I would recommend some light buddhist reading, such as Mattheiu Ricard's ""Happiness."" Give it a read. Or don't. Honestly I don't give a fuck."

But you should definitely introduce yourself first. Talk to someone for a bit, see if there is a connection and then go for the number.  Best of luck."

howtonotgiveafuck,39z0wm,Be-Bop-Brew,2,Wed Jun 17 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"I've found the success rates of cold approaches have the lowest success rates. The success rates are a lot better in social settings where there is at least one thing that is common. However, cold approaches also give really good experience when it comes to talk to women. If you can get over the approach anxiety there then you'll have no problem approaching women in a social setting where there is something common."

An intelligent person would feel flattered/attractive by being asked for their number after a friendly exchange of smiles. If she is not interested she can always say something like 'that's flattering, but sorry -I already have a boyfriend' or something to that extent. My point is: a mature person would understand the situation and feel good about someone showing interest in them in a nice way, instead of being surprised and saying a ridiculous 'uhh.... No? ? ? ?'. That is just so childish and stupid. Even if she would not share your interest, there were a million better and more normal ways to decline. I would not bother thinking about her if I were you, OP. She needs to grow up."

So being yourself (your clothing, way you behave, way you speak [our voices change depending on who we speak to), really depends on others!  Also I think you jumped to the wrong conclusion it doesn't show that you should just be yourself regardless. It shows more how if people don't understand something, and it involves strangers that don't really look part of their tribe, they feel apprehensive.  This tribal ""us vs them"" behaviour informs things like why you get people stealing/taking advantage of certain people or killing. But then you get that jarring picture of them (I.e. Hitler), being so loving to children & animals (aka their own).  I.e. say you were a white businessman looking Dude like the guy in the real hustle (remember that show?), people are less apprehensive because it seems you have money & look socially prestigious, so you have it all, so why are you doing something? They'll think it's probably not because you're out to take advantage, i mean you have it all."

Those two things may seem the same, but in reality they're completely different. Just think about them for a moment.  Not giving a shit is neglecting people and things, not doing your homework, not caring about other people, being a lazy asshat (basically what you described). Not giving a fuck is being yourself no matter what people say, enjoying your life to the fullest and not being limited by others.   I think many people misunderstand the idea of not giving a fuck and think it means the same as not giving a shit (though I think you might realise now that they have a totally different connotation). That's why we get people like the ones you mentioned, those who think they don't give a fuck when they're actually just douchebags that don't give a shit.  Edit: My first gilded comment is about something that I actually believe in...that makes me happy :D Just remember: give a shit, but don't give a fuck.

Meaning that if you aren't even willing to give a damn, you aren't willing to even think about it. Not giving a fuck means that you just don't want to put in more effort than you need to.   If you don't give a fuck, you may still give a damn. Kinda a double negative way of thinking.  It's not an exact science, but it works"
howtonotgiveafuck,39qfsm,yalik3that,2,Sun Jun 14 18:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think it makes more sense to sort them the other way around, because not giving a damn is stronger in its meaning than not giving a shit which is itself stronger than not giving a fuck.

howtonotgiveafuck,39qfsm,jerryFrankson,-1,Sun Jun 14 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"Words Words Words...  See, ""I don't give a fuck what people think"" is fine.  ""I don't give a fuck about what people think OF ME"" is not okay.   Even the darkest minds care about reputation.  People can be used in a utilitarian fashion to achieve greater magnitudes than ones self can.  People can be easily moved like pawns to achieve your desires.  Example: Marcus Aurelius, one of the greatest stoics of all time.  Now, one cannot allow themselves to be emotionally, or bodily moved by the thoughts of others.  Simply laugh it off or coin whatever they say as a joke.  Though you should understand that others opinions of you (If it is a consistent opinion from the entire population of earth thinks so- then perhaps it is time to change the outer self to suit human requirement to be a social animal.) do matter because reputation does.  The reputation of ""I don't give a fuck about what people think of me"" implies a lack of power in inter-social dynamic.  Thus, for a person like me, I would have no desire to interact with them because they are bottom feeders.    We have to ask, what is ""The self?""  It is a combination of what you have learned and experienced, some biological interaction and nothing else.  Change is active and dynamic on a consistent basis.  If you choose to study charisma and human interaction- it will change you.  Some say, ""But that isn't being yourself!"", I say, It is.  Your self is the combination of your education.

howtonotgiveafuck,39qfsm,nirenem,3,Sun Jun 14 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"""I don't give a fuck what people think"" is fine. ""I don't give a fuck about what people think OF ME"" is not okay.    I honestly don't think that's true. A lot of this sub is about getting over anxiety by not giving a fuck what people think of you.  Maybe a better one might be that it's okay to not give a fuck about how people affect you, but it's not okay to not give a fuck about how you affect them? Freedom up until the point where it infringes on other people's freedom."
howtonotgiveafuck,39qfsm,jerryFrankson,3,Sun Jun 14 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"That parent comment is way too manipulative for my liking, but I don't completely agree with you either. What HTNGAF-ism boils down to for me, is that I don't have unlimitless fucks to give. Because my time on earth is limited, which is fine. And because my energy and passion are limited, which is fine too. It just means that I have to decide which things are worth giving a fuck about.  So if someone is looking at me strangely, then tough luck. I've got way better things to spend my fucks on than some random stranger in the street. Like friends and hobbies and movies and lovely weather and delicious food and the way that girl is smiling at me and opening a fresh beer on a warm day and that ""Man, this is the life"" moment and the adrenaline you get when you're going down a rollercoaster and the smiles on my friends' faces when they get out and...  Well, all the things that make me happy. Those are the important bits. Those are the things I save my fucks for.  Now, that's my way of looking at it and living it. Others have different interpretations and that's fine. Just do what works for you, and everything else isn't worth giving a fuck about ;)"

howtonotgiveafuck,39pn4j,meowkittyxx,10,Sat Jun 13 15:07:27 2015 UTC,All i know is that visualization and positive thinking only go so far. I would say exercise is definitely one way to build confidence and self-esteem directly. Also doing things you fear maybe? I'd also like to get people's opinions on this
howtonotgiveafuck,39pn4j,weekndwarrior,9,Sat Jun 13 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Personally for me its not outter appearance as much as it is just being confident as a person. I can work out sure, but that doesn't fix the problems going on internally. I've also noticed that my lack of self esteem and worth seep into other arenas of my life. Why do I procrastinate and don't have any motivation? If I truly loved myself I wouldn't be doing these things. I've been trying positive affirmations but it's been a really slow process."
howtonotgiveafuck,39pn4j,weekndwarrior,3,Sat Jun 13 16:06:08 2015 UTC,"Well the thing is, it's hard recommending a sort of ""one-size-fits-all"" solution. When I bring up exercise, I don't necessarily mean the benefits that come from it appearance-wise. There are also the internal benefits of exercise like ya know, feeling healthy? lol. Not just that but exercise regulates mood and for most people it's not a healthy habit so just going out there getting it done can feel like an accomplishment, it's all subjective really. I think things like affirmations, mantras and other positive thinking type of exercises will only work for a subset of people and even then it doesn't really fix the problem ya know? I can tell myself I love my body everyday but if im fat and overweight and honestly think i look gross, those affirmations are just going to screw with my head lol. I hope i didn't ramble on too much, I'm still trying to figure this stuff out myself."

You're a human being living on this planet. You're a living consciousness and your happiness depends on the fact that you understand your life has value. How do you measure that? You don't, value is an abitrary concept therefore your value is up to you, make up the rules. Is there a council somewhere determining your worth and happiness level? Fuck no, life is essentially meaningless and whatever you do that doesn't take away from someone else's happiness has no negative effect so fuck it, be happy."

This is the highest-regarded work on the subject of self-esteem, and will give you many insights into the workings of your own mind as well as the minds of others.   It will help you to pinpoint in detail what you feel about yourself that is regarded to be healthy, and what you feel about yourself that is regarded to be a reflection of holding an incorrect perspective of self (or an incorrect self-esteem).   There are methods in the book that can aid you in forming a healthy self-esteem on all fronts - however just reading and digesting the material I personally believe would help anyone to begin to ingest a complete and correct perspective of themselves.  I'm sure that you will learn a lot, and much of it will be of help."

How did i fix it ? well i got laid. i put in 110 % effort because i couldnt stand it, and so i was  motivated to fix  it using practice and hard work any tool i could find manipulation fake confidence etc. but!!!! i am in another long dry spell now, but i am not spiralling into depression. this is because i have unteethered my self worth from getting laid. You have to examine what and how your self esteem is made of   what did i tie my self esteem  to instead?> I didn't. I look good i act confidently, i get out and seize the day by myself. if i do that, i allow myself to pat myself on the back, i got out and played soccer,m it doesnt matter if i win or lose     another way, if that doesnt work is to find another source of confidence. i was depressed and low. no friends no ladies nojob. goodbye traditional sources of confidence. so . i taught myself how to use powertools and built a table out of logs in my parents basement.This table is fucking badass, and i still use it as my coffee table today.

I don't wear v necks for you or for anyone else, I do it because I hate wearing crewnecks and having them rub on my skin. I wear makeup (especially heavy eyeliner) because I like how it looks. I'm sure most people think it's too much or it looks trashy, but it makes me happy. Most of my clothes are clingy because I have a curvy body type and my other option with the clothes I own right now is to wear things that are baggy, which is utterly unappealing because that's not the aesthetic I prefer.   Not all women dress for men. I would venture to say a significant number of them don't. Your thinking seems to neglect the option that women can dress in ways that make them happy, and men may find that manner of dress visually appealing. But it may have nothing to do with men at all.

If I had a lot of money, I'd spend a lot of it on my appearance as it directly affects how you carry yourself and (I think, and many successful people would completely agree) contributes directly toward your overall success in life.   The unfortunate reality is that people judge one another based on appearance. If you dress well and look good, people assume several things about you: 1) that you aren't lazy; 2) that you have at least some money; 3) that you probably get laid every so often; 4) that you have a decent job. On the other hand, when you see someone wearing some ill-fitting jeans and some shitty t-shirt, you assume that they don't care.

howtonotgiveafuck,39kh3k,TheBrownBus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, in this scenario its pretty normal to give a fuck.  The only way to not give a fuck about this sort of thing is by doing it.  I heard some quote along the lines of courage is not the absence of fear, but acting despite fear, and that's what you have to do here.  Act despite your fear.  Once you've done it once you will feel incredibly empowered and it won't seem like a big deal the next time.  Make the goal to be doing the thing as opposed to her saying yes.  At the end of the day, having the courage to ask will feel good regardless of what she says, even if her saying yes will feel better.  The only possible result from you asking is a positive one."

Not her friends, you'll have to deal with them but by that point if she says yes she'll guide you through that shit. If they dont like you, well i guess its good your not dating them and they can deal with it. If she says no i guess you really don't have to worry about it, its as close to a win win as you can get! Its really gay but I literally always tell myself ""Nike man just do it"" before I ask a girl out. Its might help you, it might not, it just makes me laugh about it enough to where its not as serious as it was before and take a little pressure off."
howtonotgiveafuck,39kh3k,zabts,0,Fri Jun 12 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"Ask your girl out. Find the guts. But what if, sadly, you don't have the guts ? Involve the friend-girl. Tell her that your-girl thinks you like her but you just want to clear the air. Then slyly confide in her that you actually like your-girl. The friend-girl will almost definitely tell your-girl. So your-girl will know without you telling her. Assess your-girl's behavior (or not, your wish) and go hit on her now (or not, your wish, she knows already anyway). But seriously though, try to find the guts to ask your girl out directly."

After all, there are a hundred reasons she didn't/couldn't answer the phone at that moment.   Now, if you're taking into consideration the angst and anxiety that comes from will she/won't she call me back, and then finally resigning yourself to she won't, then I can start to buy it as a rejection.  In the end, it wasn't the ""in your face"" immediate rejections of your other tests.  Good luck!"

Had you asked for a discount for no reason it would have been all right, but lying wasn't cool, especially given that you had such an enjoyable meal.

howtonotgiveafuck,39fris,Instant_Bacon,3,Thu Jun 11 15:59:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe Maybe not. Either way once we'd been talking for 2 minutes it simply became a pleasant conversation and half an hour in any idea of rejection had gone long out the window.

I second what some other person said here, she was probably just complimenting your confidence. Also, I have to disagree on your theory about altering the environment and removing all negative influences when it comes to changing someone's behaviour. This is just not true in all cases. Psychology is never simple and mostly also not 100% accurate. Let me ask you, are you a doctor? Or where did you get this information? I would feel offended if someone not in my profession would tell me how to do my job. Maybe not as extreme as her, but that doesn't matter. I saw your latest post and thought to myself, that is a really interesting story and I want to read more about it... but this one and the Playstation piece was very off-putting, to be honest. Pity."

howtonotgiveafuck,39azo8,DranDran,9,Thu Jun 11 07:42:37 2015 UTC,It was hard because like most men I've been brought up in a world where approaching a man sexually could result in violence.

Difference being, those other exercises dont involve actually lying ('cause you arent really into any of the guys nor do you want a date).   The whole point of ""X DAYS OF REJECTION"", I thought, was to train yourself in being rejeted to something you ACTUALLY WANT. This is more like.. X DAYS OF AWKWARD SITUATIONS. xD  I guess its the deception or misleading part of your excercise that rubs me the wrong way, because chances are you will run into a gay guy who will be into you, and then youll have to let him down by telling him hes jsut part of a personal experiment. But to each their own."

It might have been breaking through ""social norms"" way back when, but the majority of the population has accepted the fact that some men are attracted to other men. Not just some men, a lot of men, actually.  Breaking through social norms would be you dressing like a girl and THEN going and doing this fucking weird little experiment of yours.  I'll show myself out of this subreddit now."

But I am a stubborn bastard. Some people find meaning in specific goals or acomplishments. I've personally found my drive by seeing my existence as a undefeatable enemy who my greatest hope is to stall, reduce the hits I take, and with much luck and effort occasionally win brief, prized moments of bliss. Framing myself in oppositional way, my bullheadedness kicks in and helps me take the slings and arrows. There is no crown and there is no prize, but even if it is pointless I can choose to cling to life and spit in the face of an insane universe simply because I find challenge and humor in doing so.  I'm not here to change the world, I'm a tourist just trying to carve out a little space for myself where I can live out my life trying to minimize the pain and heartache of myself and and those around me."

howtonotgiveafuck,39e8cl,blauman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:46:42 2015 UTC,"I'm inspired by maslow, and of looking at the unique features of the human being, of theory of mind, of linguistic language being unique, how it's linked to empathy - the arts we like best are the ones that speak to us most.  And here's what it can ultimately all be drawn towards of fulfilment in life:   Realise your social identity that makes you belong best & enjoy adventures in life together with them. Maslow was missing sustained novelty/entertainment as a fundamental human motivator.    That's what it all comes down to.  feel free to ask me questions, i have written more extensively with more elaboration, but here's some questions that I address:   Why is the cosmic perspective powerful - true universalism, social identity. it expands the tribe beyond appearance & engaging in the right arts & culture - of music, film, tv. Expanding the tribe gets rid of us vs them. https://soundcloud.com/radio3arts-ideas/r3arts-free-thinking-21 a nice podcast with scholars from europe talking about identity. what makes things ""entertaining""? why is comedy funny, entertaining. Why do people like shiny rocks (newton has a quote about being drawn to a pebble on the beach). Why do some people cry at maths equations? What about being interested in weird objects, etc. It comes down to novelty - knowing how something is 'rare', the human behaviour of taboo i say is rooted in here too.   So sustained novelty & realising your social identity - to belong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belongingness  i have work in a bit so sorry about the bad formatting but i can write it up more eloquently later (i have documented these ideas elsewhere)."
howtonotgiveafuck,39e8cl,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"Belongingness:       Belongingness is the human emotional need to be an accepted member of a group. Whether it is family, friends, co-workers, or a sports team, humans have an inherent desire to belong and be an important part of something greater than themselves. This implies a relationship that is greater than simple acquaintance or familiarity. The need to belong is the need to give and receive affection from others.   Belonging is a strong and inevitable feeling that exists in human nature and can be the result of one's own choices, or the choices of others. Because not everyone has the same life and interests, not everyone belongs to the same thing or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify oneself as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to one's surroundings.   Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary argue that belongingness is such a fundamental human motivation that we feel severe consequences of not belonging. If it wasn’t so fundamental, then lack of belonging wouldn’t have such dire consequences on us. This desire is so universal that the need to belong is found across all cultures and different types of people.

The body quickly goes back to it's normal, automatic mode of thinking and function after challenges like this. Yes, you do get the experiences but they won't make much of a difference after a few months pass.   What I would recommend you to do (after the challenge) is build yourself a daily routine where you would meet this kinds of challenges on a regular basis. Actually, it doesn't have to be daily. Make it at least weekly. After some time, that will become your automatic mode of thinking and functioning and that's where the real change begins.  Also, remember this golden rule of knowledge: It has 3 parts to it. Listening, thinking about (or doing, like you are now), and implementing it into your own life. Aim at the last one!

howtonotgiveafuck,397yro,WTEL,13,Tue Jun 9 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"My dad is dealing with some really stressful shit that in result can create some very nasty negative shit. He directs a lot of that negativity at me. He isn't always like that, but the last couple of years dealing with what he's dealing with has really made him more sassy.   When he gets like that I hang up on him. He can be really hurtful to me sometimes. I'll stop him mid sentence and say something along the lines of ""OK I'm done I will talk to you when you're not being an asshole"".   While some people would never dream of calling their dad an asshole, that's just the kind of relationship I have with my dad. We're a very blunt and brutal Italian family when need be.   That's how I deal with it. Usually once he's calm he will call and apologize and we'll talk about it like rational adults. But in the heat of the anger I just hang up on him lol."
howtonotgiveafuck,397yro,buttholemuffin,16,Wed Jun 10 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Tell him he's being an ignoramus, and that you won't talk to him until you're able to have a proper adult conversation. Then hang up."

If you honestly won't talk to him unless he treats you like an adult then he wouldn't have a chance to treat you like shit, because you aren't talking to him. You can't just say you need to treat me respectfully or I'm walking and then not walk. Stand up for yourself and tell your father that if he wants to be a part of your life he needs to respect you. This may be a hard thing to do but it is worth it, trust me."

So he's not always shit...if I blocked him out completely until he changes, that would mean losing some conveniences too. In a practical sense I need him for some stuff.  Given I know he's a borderline psychopath, who also has the belief that nobody can change, along with a ton of other cynical deeply ingrained beliefs, it seems unlikely that he'll ever change. So I'm just trying to make the best of a shit situation, minimising the shit by hanging up when I can etc.  And despite our differences, it would bother us both if we were completely estranged from each other. At least, I still think a ""normally OK but sometimes shitty"" sense of family is better than none."

They fail to realize when their children has surpassed them in some areas, and don't need to be further ""humbled"", especially to a point where this becomes discouraging  instead. Not to say we shouldn't respect them.  They assume this: I am the father and I can say as much guilt inducing shit to my kid as I want, I have the right and will forever have the right. What they don't realize that the guilt inducing shit, once might have educational merit when they are in power, is useless and simply annoying now that you have a life of your own.  Find me a happy, encouraging man in his 40s and I will guarantee he has no children or married.  Unfortunately, I accept that fathers are not meant to be friends, and they teach us trial by fire at an early age, even if this does not stop at later age. If it makes you feel better, my father has not talked to me for the last 3 months. Just don't GAF. Don't know how to say it."

howtonotgiveafuck,397yro,fuckkarma,2,Wed Jun 10 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"That's personal emotion. Avoiding it is still letting unconscious anger take an affect on you. This method lets you feel the emotion that you couldn't let out with him around. That's the point of it. Letting your body know that it's okay to feel that way, so next time won't be so damn frustrating. I've let out many withheld tears doing this.  Avoiding a thought is avoiding a negative emotion. Perceiving negative emotion is fear of emotion. Emotions don't go away, but emotions are never inherently bad, though they are sometimes blocked unconsciously."

howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,DarkStarXP,31,Tue Jun 9 16:35:44 2015 UTC,"Where do I start?    I get the impression sometimes that your insecurities make you perceive situations that may not be negative in a very negative light.    The person with your bag seemed to be concerned about you more than attacking you. I know it's hard when someone says something that you don't want to hear or don't want to accept about yourself and your first reaction is outrage and ""why is this person attacking me?"". But I think if you did some self reflection you might come to ask yourself ""would my grandfather be proud of my behaviour?"".    You are so young and at this time in most people's lives they are trying to discover themselves, to see where they fit in, how they want to present themselves to the world and it can be...fucking awful sometimes. And trust me when I say that even the kids who are popular or seem to have it all together are feeling just the way you do a lot of the time.  This may be hard to believe but ask anyone over 25 and they will tell you the same.    All I can say is please don't question yourself. You are who you are and there is nothing wrong with that even if the people around you think a different lifestyle is ""cool"" right now.    I think that YOU believe your glasses make you look nerdy which causes you to think that everyone else feels the same.  If you rocked those glasses like they made you motherfucking Einstein/Elvis Presley had a baby - I guarantee others would slowly start to think the same as you.    Whether you pursue medical or not, tennis can always be a beloved hobby to you. And you know what? You'll probably enjoy it more that way.    If you are seriously concerned about your health I would advise talking to your parents about seeing a professional. Just to talk or even possibly see if you need medication. If your family truly are medical professionals then they will understand the importance of mental health and strive to help you. You say you are most comfortable with your parents and were close to your brother so REACH OUT TO THEM! You don't have to struggle alone.    Keep your head up and do what's right for you. What others think will turn out to be a vague memory in the great span of your lifetime.     And seek professional help if you need it and never be ashamed of that."

howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,Ek70R,3,Tue Jun 9 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear things suck ass. Sometimes life sucks ass for a lot of us so you're not alone there.  You're already doing one of the things I would do in your position, which is looking for support. Maybe it's possible that if you could try to widen your support network, find more activities or things that you enjoy and make you feel connected, and balance out this stuff with some positive things you'd start feeling a bit better. That is what I mean when I use the word ''support''. You've said your parents and brother make you happy, so you have them, and you can have/make others.  Secondly you point out that there are situations that you have tried to cope with by altering some of your behaviors and it is absolutely not working for you. So, different solutions need to be found. Again this goes back to finding some way that you can get support from others and gain ideas of how to deal with these things that WILL work for you. A therapist or book or friend or whatever are all resources to figure out different ideas of how to deal with the shit of life that we all deal with.  There are really nice people in the world, there are really fun things, and you will fit in somewhere, just got to find it"
howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,poopaduped,3,Tue Jun 9 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"Your mind is holding you back. That time where you are with your family and have fun and ngaf is what you want to reproduce in other activities. Well, how do you do that you ask. First you should learn that your emotions thoughts are not controlled by you so learn to accept that and ngaf about them. Your goal is not to fight these emotions nor to chase particular ones. That is because if you rely on your thoughts emotions you re going to be a slave of them. you shuld learn to let them float from you. This is the true meaning  of ngaf. That is what you are doing when you are whith your family. You let the emotions thoughts float and are 100 percent on the present. The thing is your are doing that unconsciously so learn to do it consciously. That time where you are giving a fuck is the time your mind is dragging you from the reality. And that is because you can not controll your inner experiences as much as you would like to."
howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,kgkfdjjlkdgjd,3,Tue Jun 9 17:56:53 2015 UTC,Have you tried talking to any of your teachers? I think they'd be really understanding. You also need to see a therapist big time. But not much longer and you can go to uni and I think a change of scenery might help you. I've struggled with social anxiety but not as badly as you have I don't think. But if you ever want to talk to a random internet stranger I'm here :)
howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,Delilahhaze,2,Tue Jun 9 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"You should access any counseling services your college provides.  You need to get treatment for your anxiety and depression.  You should also open up to your patents and siblings about your feelings and problems.  As medical professionals, they will hopefully understand that anxiety and depression are real diseases that can be treated, and can provide some of the support you need.  Another thing that will probably help would be to join some clubs on campus.  Interacting with people while doing an activity you enjoy will help take some of the social pressure off you and also make it easier to practice your social skills, and maybe you'll make some friends."

You should try and see if there are people in college who like tennis who maybe you can rally with. Try not to worry about walking and that library guy is an arsehole.

How do I know this? because what doesnt kill you makes you stronger, stronger everytime. Probably right now nothing of this shit makes sense, but when you get older you´d probably say, I fucking did it!!.   So my advice is, browse through this sub and the wonderful advice it has to offer and keep going from there, remember not giving a fuck is a skill, and like everybody around here, we are learning it everyday. Also, Id advise you to go to the gym, lift some weights eat a lot and get muscle mass, trust me it will make your self confidence skyrocket, start by not giving a fucking fuck a little step at a time, your situation is hard BUT YOU ARE HARDER, it will make you very very strong over time. And as a guy who constantly wore glasses since a little kid I can say that yea, wearing glasses sucked ass and still does, but hey it is who we are, we are glass wearers and we look awesome with them, it is part of our personality, the best we can do is choosing a nice pair of kick ass shades and rock them!. Go ahead bro I trust you come on!."

howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,RakeRieme,2,Tue Jun 9 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"Plastic frames can't hide my hipster shame. I love my glasses now that I don't f-ing look like hairy potter. haha It's unfathomable how many people told me that. I was like you are just now using hairy potter as a reference? You scrub, I read that book like 4 years ago, read a real book like some avant garde fiction, maybe some house of leaves or upon a winter's night a traveller. And I wonder why I became an English Major XD  EDIT: OP, suggestion to totally read ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" by Milan Kundera. Just the description might get you: ""A young woman in love with a man torn between his love for her and his incorrigible womanizing; one of his mistresses and her humbly faithful lover—these are the two couples whose story is told in this masterful novel. In a world in which lives are shaped by irrevocable choices and by fortuitous events, a world in which everything occurs but once, existence seems to lose its substance, its weight. Hence, we feel ""the unbearable lightness of being"" not only as the consequence of our pristine actions but also in the public sphere, and the two inevitably intertwine.""  EDIT 2: There is a positive way to read the book and I think it could be very enlightening for you. It was for me at least :)"

howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,RakeRieme,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:48:55 2015 UTC,"Hey man- First off, I think you're in a much better place than most people who have these thoughts at your age. You are very self-aware, which is great. All that means is that you have that much more power to change your mindset.   If you only hear one thing from me, it should be this: GO SEE A PROFESSIONAL NOW. See a psychiatrist/pschologist, spiritual counselor, whatever...I wish I had at your age!  You have a HUGE advantage. You are still very young. You have YEARS ahead of you to shape the way you're going to be as an adult, and the awareness you have at the moment is a foundation for significant changes in your life if you take advantage NOW.  You're a smart guy. You see there are problems in your life, and you're seeking a solution. So the only next step in the process is to start seeking that solution (outside of reddit, of course...but this is a good start!). It's a long process and it's not easy by any means, but it doesn't have to be like this, and right now, you are in the best position possible to change it.   Feel free to PM me if you just need someone to talk to. I hate seeing people in desperate situations, especially if you're entertaining suicide. That's not a good place to be, so please reach out to your family, friends, someone. I promise, it's not as bad as it seems!"
howtonotgiveafuck,396hrr,DrDeath008,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:43:27 2015 UTC,"I have the same issues and on top of that I am being screened for bipolar yet again. Different story. Anyway I have MDD, Panic Disorder, and GAD as far as positive and confirmed diagnosis go. I am 24 to give you an idea, and I have had anxiety and depression since I was 10 or 11. It used to be mostly social, but has evolved to include things like going to the store and even panic about the prospect of panic. I was adopted basically at birth and I grew up pretty comfortably, but when I was young I was bullied and harassed constantly till I transfered schools. I experienced a LOT of death in my family at a young age. I have HORRIBLE social anxiety and I often do waht you do, but I am just now after starting therapy again, beginning to see that 50% of these types of situations are simply the other person. I think, OP that you are like many of us here and very aware of social scenarios, almost like you feel more weight when dealing with them. It is then really no surprise that you would place an extreme amount of import to social interactions as well. You see, I also have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and the way I look at it is that my social anxiety is NOT getting anxious in social siutations because I think and notice and feel things, but rather my social anxiety is the fact that I CANNOT easily let go of certain events to the point where they tear me apart and eat me alive. Guilt about not saying goodbye to someone, etc. It gets pretty crazy. However, in college I was the President of my fraternity which is an odd position given my circumstances. What I gain from that is that yes my anxiety is an issue that causes me great discomfort and even horrible issues, but when I was needed, I was able to pull through. I maintained this even given my circumstances for almost a whole year. In the end I crashed and burned, but no one around me remembers me for that. I can almost guarantee you one of two things. That the guy who said this has bigger issues, to which I would say to try to listen and detach, because the information you get from the way he talks to you can eventually provide you with the firepower to let him know to back off if it is a constant issue. Not necessarily to get back at him or anything though.   TL;DR TC PLEASE do not think ANYTHING is wrong with you based on the scenario. The ONLY ""wrong"" thing that I can notice is that you seem to want to think that you are akward etc. That is NORMAL and like others have said are mostly insecurities. You just aren't an asshole about it, and quite frankly that is something to be proud of. However, I am super nerdy and I understand the feeling, but my suggestion is maybe pick up a new hobby like try to go to the gym or something. If you cannot change but one thing, change the conversation. (A wise piece of advice I heard many times in reference to fraternity stereotypes and sexual assault which I like to think we worked to prevent at our house- I for one took on this hyper-vigilant role which allowed me to feel like I had a job at parties, and paradoxically relax). My other recommendation is not the greatest thing to hear (I've flushed meds when I was put on them at a young age) but I didn't get much relief in therapy with my MDD until I tried 6 antidepressants. One made me feel like I had the flu, others made me vomit, and even another effected my breathing and heart rate to a dangerous level. I have been on: lexapro, abilify, clonazepam, ritalin, focalin, adderal, vyvanse, dextroamphetamine, seroquel, cymbalta, effexor, paroxetine, risperedal (HELLISH MED for me--> Gained 20lbs in a month right before my senior picture), and even more but honestly I don't think going on is gonna help. What I do want you to know TC is that I was really bad, I did some awful shit recently because I had the worst depressive episode I have ever had, I still have these issues, and they frustrate the living hell out of me, but I CANNOT lose hope and focus. Now, 2 days ago if you would have said that to me I would have wanted to tear you apart, but we have to do what we can and take things a day at a time. Man I have so much more I want to say but I am just one guy. You have support, please don't forget that, even if it's just a bunch of people all over the world saying they have similar issues. It may not be the fix you want, but stop and think about that for a second, and it is still pretty amazing. Plus I don't think my SA is all that bad, because there have been many times that my anxiety has come along with gut feelings, and it turns out I am a pretty good judge of character in other people- so in a way it has helped me too.  EDIT: Yes I know those aren't all ADs, I have taken many meds.  EDIT2: It hasn't been said enough, it might be hard but reach out to a professional BOTH in the medical field and a counselor to talk to. The fact that most of my issues were untreated plays a 100% role in the fact that I am more dysfunctional today. Also, go to someone you like. So many people don't want to help you, they want to solve you. That isn't good. Find the person who wants to, and will help you.  EDIT 3: I am a logical person so this kinda stuff helps me but idk if you will like it. When you say: ""I also wore glasses right after my problems had just begun. It makes me look like a nerd which makes people see me in a negative light. I feel that if I stop wearing them, I am just lying to myself and it shows that I care too much about what people think."" this is not a convincing argument because it is circular and contradictory. I say that because the next time you think something along those lines, remind yourself how silly the logic is (you have a situation where your conclusion is always true but your assumptions don't necessarily lead up to that conclusion without a bunch of added logic let's call this x- the added logic is negative self talk- for me this happens almost in an effort to convince myself that things are worse than they truly are by literally convincing myself of truths that simply aren't true or logical). This part takes WORK, but if you can sit there and agree with what I said, then the next time you have the same thought, just say well this is that x shit and I already know it's silly. Then try to focus on something very detailed and get lost in it. It takes training but this is one of the only things that has helped my SA because according to my therapy it started at a young age which means going up against lots of previously learned and engrained behaviors"
howtonotgiveafuck,391qgt,Lightfiend,29,Mon Jun 8 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"A psychopath is basically by definition deeply anti-social, and I don't mean that in the common sense of ""introverted"" but in the sense of ""I'll destroy society and other people if I damn well please"".    Not caring what people think is just the tip of the psychopath iceberg.  Not giving a fuck should not extend to complete lack of empathy and willingness to hurt people for selfish aims.   I think a disregard for opinions of others sounds nice, but only if you have a pathologically burdensome regard for others' opinions.  Or in other words, if you give too much of a fuck, a psychopath mentality sounds good in comparison.  But it's hard for you to imagine truly not caring at all if you hurt someone.   For psychopaths, they by default don't care if they hurt ANYONE.    I think that you're partly right, psychopaths are a good case study in not giving a fuck, in the way that the Nazis are a good case study in efficiency.  Yes, they had some interesting ideas and methods, but it's important to be clear about what you're learning from them, and what you should never learn from them."

Absolutely, that's all I'm trying to do here.  The book and article mention how we should think of these traits on a sliding scale. I think all of us here understand this, especially in the context of ""not giving a fuck:""  None of us want to 100% not give a fuck - but we are here because we give too much fucks. And in that sense, turning up the ""not giving a fuck"" dial is what our goal is."

I have also known people who fit the description of your friend (drug dealer, many shallow relationships to draw upon, upbeat narcissistic attitude and not caring what others think), and while they are extremely popular they are also... psychopaths. While they can quickly superficially connect with people, a skill arguable more useful than any other in today's world, they also are often abusers, thieves, cruel towards animals (guy I knew loved to kick dogs), and cheaters. Many are also prone towards temper tantrums when they don't get their way and I wouldn't say that is really not giving a fuck."

howtonotgiveafuck,391qgt,garblz,8,Tue Jun 9 12:38:38 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying OP. There is a great deal to learn from psychopaths. I know a lot of people may disagree because of the serial killing stereotype out there, but that's just not the case with every psychopath. There is definitely a happy middle road between psychopath and worry wart. Most of lie to the extreme end with being too passive, caring, and self protective. Psychopaths are on the other end. I think reaching a middle road while getting the best of both worlds is what we're all after.   Learning from psychopaths definitely can teach us a lot. Sometimes that immaturity and primal nature is something that we lack. Being too in our heads and planning and worrying all the time makes us alienated from people.   What I've noticed in studying psychopathology (as a hobby) is that a lot of what you said of your friend is very true. Nothing really gets under their skin. Part of it is that they see humans as tools. And I've actually experienced this before. When I was younger and as a waiter all I cared about was getting tips. I saw people as a means to an end and plastered on a fake as smile and often would lie my way to tips. But I would get huge tips. Like 200-300% of the meal.   Later in life, I was a caring person and at the same time I got a sales job. I crashed and I burned. Everyone in my office didn't give a damn about the customers, but it helped them excel in that job. I cared about my customers, but none of them ever helped me... and despite all my good intentions, nobody really liked me and I flopped.  Now, I don't want to live life taking advantage of others all the time. But that's what relationships are. A trade. And sometimes you need to take what you need from others without so heavily caring about what happens to them. This seems to be a repeating pattern I keep running into. Whenever I white knight something, it blows it in my face. I end up making things worse. Everyone's uncomfortable and pissed. A good example of this is when I was seeing 2 girls at the same time. I wanted to do the right thing and break it off with one and continue seeing the other. Both girls ended up pissed off because I was doing the ""right thing"" and being honest.  I've learned many people want to be lied to. There's a fantasy, a kind of mystery and beauty in it. Much like people want to believe in magic, Santa Clause, or Religion. Psychopaths can deliver it. Giving fucks and caring about other people destroys that fantasy many times. It puts things in a negative perspective when you start caring about how the story is narrated. It's like when people complain about Game of Thrones and how unfaithful it is to the books. Some people don't give a fuck, embrace it, and even interpret it in their own way. It's more attractive.  I got a bit ranty so I'm going to stop. But Yes I totally agree with you OP"
howtonotgiveafuck,391qgt,Emsteroo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"I've learned many people want to be lied to. There's a fantasy   God, yes! I mean what people love is a coherent book-like story, but normal life just doesn't roll out like that. And a certain disregard for other people does allow you to create this illusion for them.   Both girls ended up pissed off because I was doing the ""right thing"" and being honest.   No wonder for me. Let me tell you about my (unpopular) stance on the subject: I don't care if my wife cheats on me, as long as I'm not aware of it. Like, she goes to a party without me, has a bit too much alcohol, and a bit too much fun, and this leads to sex. So what? Stuff like that happens, people are just people. But if you have the courage to do it, have the strength to deal with your own guilt and don't make it my problem. My 20-year marriage is too important for me for trivialities like this to destroy it. As long as I have my share of warmth at home, good sex, kids and work are not neglected (in other words, just don't overdo it, or I will get pissed). But all this is another story about the rapacity and exclusiveness of monogamous relationships; I just put it in here to (maybe ?) explain the 2 girls' POV.   that's what relationships are. A trade.   Yeah. Is he funny? He provides you with an entertainment. Is he generous in bed? Stop pretending sex is 'sacrificing yourself on the altar of love' or you will get burnt.   One of the things women (usually) want is confidence, even if you sometimes do something against their will. To be clear I'm not talking about rape. I'm talking about going to a restaurant that's not her optimal choice. I'm talking about taking her on her word if she says she wants to go somewhere, instead of pestering her with such a myriad of 'are you sure?'s that she herself don't know anymore.  It's actually quite hard. Because if your decision doesn't work well, you will get the blame. Thing is learning to live with it and not care, because it's more about making a confident decision at all than making the right one.  Thing is, it's not the constant self-consciousness and worrying what other people might think that makes you a good person. So, if you're a good person you can work towards dropping the worrying - you'll still be a good person, but much more fun to be around."

I'd love to not care what others think and also be a little less empathetic sometimes, just so I can selfishly put my own needs ahead of others every now and then instead of trying to be so bloody diplomatic all the time. Would love just a teensy smidge of psycopathic confidence."
howtonotgiveafuck,391qgt,Pongpianskul,0,Tue Jun 9 13:30:01 2015 UTC,"One way I try to ""learn"" from the psychopathic mentality is by watching good TV and movies that portray highly functional psychopaths.  For example, I love watching scenes with characters like Walter White, Hannibal, or Frank Underwood. Their ability to keep their cool in high risk situations, their social charm and rapport building, and their clever, off-the-cuff thinking when met with unexpected challenges are - by themselves - really interesting traits that I think we all wish we had.  Am I saying I like meth dealers, cannibals, and corrupt murderous politicians? Of course not! I don't think finding something good about a person means I think they are a perfect moral human beings.  (I also understand that fictional psychopaths aren't the best examples of average psychopaths. But that doesn't really matter to me, I'm trying to dissect characteristics I admire in other people, fiction or not)."
howtonotgiveafuck,391qgt,affenlehrer,2,Tue Jun 9 13:41:05 2015 UTC,Have you read The Psychopath test by John Ronson? I haven't read it but have heard him talk a bit about his research and its really interesting too. Probably in line with all you've already written.   I think the trouble most people in this thread are having is their stereotypical idea of a psychopath is a serial killer or someone who commits atrocities without a conscience.  That some psychopaths exhibit high functioning successful traits too gets thrown out with the bath water.  It's an interesting topic!

For one thing, you only have to worry about yourself, because you're the only thing that's real.  But what does that make everything else?   Everything else is also you.  The world is your subconscious projected outward.  Why does the world suck? Because you suck.  Sounds harsh but what it really means is that all change in the world starts with you.  If you can improve yourself, your world will improve.  Anything you want is yours, for a price.  The price is you, if you give yourself to something, you will get it.  If you push yourself to overcome your subconscious, you will flourish into a world that is as beautiful as you let it be."

The experience of the world is data in our minds and is shared among the people. Those who choose to take responsibility (like say, for a war or a terrible crime) and work on it in themselves also change it in the world, because it's data in the collective mind. Not accepting guilt, but rather accepting it's data in the mind that can be changed by personally addressing it in yourself.. taking responsibility. It's like a worker stepping up to the plate to do a job no one else is doing.  It reminds me of Buddhist monks praying for the world."

Finish up the engineering degree and you'll emerge into the economy with something most people twice your age lack - the ability to do something people need and can't do for themselves.  You're working hard, making progress, and that's gonna pay off.    On confidence, realize that you should not look for objective confirmation of your self worth.  In order to find confidence your self worth needs to originate in who you are, not what you do.  There will always be another mountain to climb, something you could have handled better, someone who's done better, and if you see your worth through the lens of whether you've bested everything you could ever possibly best you're not going to get there.  So ask yourself - Why are you doing what you're doing?  What do you want from life?  What does it take to get that?  What's important to you?    From there, recognize that you're the only one who will ever care as much about you as you do.  The people who holler for real estate in your head are doing that for their own reasons and motives, and God bless 'em, but you're looking out for you.  Understand that, while others are important, they're only important to you through your own personal moral code.  People will try to convince you that you don't deserve your own moral code, that you have to follow theirs, but fuck anyone that tries that.  Every man and woman in this world has that, and that alone, as their birthright, and only fuckin rats and weasels try to take that away.  That's where confidence comes from.  People sublimate themselves because of fear for their entire lives, confidence is the refusal to do that yourself.  Fuck their curves and timelines and ideas of where you should live or what you should do or what school you should have gone to.  You're looking after your father because he's sick and you love him.  You're going to community college because you're on your own journey, and once you're an engineer who gives a shit?    Women will respond to that, especially if the moral sense of self from which your confidence arises includes a sense of respecting them insofar as they deserve it.  You shouldn't want to be with any woman, you want a woman who brings out the best in you and you bring out the best in her.  Hope that helps jack.  You're doing good."

I grew up very, very awkward and felt it was necessary to go over hurdles to gain confidence. I struggled for years until I had moment like yours and I did some research.   I remember hearing about a trick, which I now incorporate in my life now, that a famous billionaire shared in an interview recently as well. Go through your failures at the end of every day and identify them and be honest with yourself. The ""trick"" (not really a trick, but that's how it was presented to me as) is to be honest and recognize that ""hey, that's where I failed and where I can improve on tomorrow, or the next time I come across a similar incident."" I know this doesn't help in the immediate moment, but I think long term it will build lasting confidence in your life, as I found it to have done for me.   I like the idea of focusing on negativity because you don't place yourself in what I would call a ""drunken stupor of confidence,"" similar to taking a few drinks and using that crutch to get you some confidence. I found that pushing myself to do things I was afraid of -- or rather, things that I knew I SHOULD do (so not jumping in front of cars or anything) -- which would throw me into extraordinarily uncomfortable situations. I would force myself to approach a girl with no plan on what to say just to get myself to talk to her and to allow myself to build a natural conversation.   Let me tell you, this is not a quick fix. This is a long term method to developing skills to self improve, especially on confidence.

howtonotgiveafuck,38y58k,MrBawwws,3,Sun Jun 7 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has bad skin.... It's often digestive issues. SIBO, Candida, H.Pylori, allergies, etc..  I'm only mentioning it because it's not common knowledge, even for dermatologists and doctors. I'm not coming from the aspect of pseudo science or homeopathy or any of that crap.  You can test it. If you have reactive skin, try going all out on dairy, gluten, sugar, etc. Your symptoms will be 10x worse. The exact mechanism is theorized to be either leaky gut, or the bacteria/fungus causing an overload of toxins. (ranging from endotoxins to histamine)   Eliminate all garbage food, take digestive enzymes, eat garlic, bitters, ginseng, lemon juice, or apple cider vinegar and the vast majority see improvement.  I'm sure I'll be downvoted by someone but you can really look it up if you're concerned about your skin. Eczema, Psoriasis, Dermatitis, Acne, and Rosacea patients all over the world have reported that diet changes do in fact make significant changes to their skin.  That or the removal of an environmental toxin. Usually in the case of eczema. Sometimes it is hard/soft water or mineral deficiencies. But those are also related to the toxin tolerance of the person because of their gut issues."

I've done gluten free low carb paleo (although with some dairy included) for 8 months and didn't notice any changes. On a separate occasion I did dairy free for 30-40 days and again nothing changed.
howtonotgiveafuck,38y58k,Monkey_Jerk,2,Tue Jun 9 03:25:03 2015 UTC,"It depends on the person, but for many it's more important to change and identify what is the gut problem. For example, if you have leaky gut, that needs to be repaired. But more likely there is a system parasite that needs to be eliminated first. And then another set of bacteria needs to take it's place. AKA. Probiotics.  I'm not an expert but I find this guy particularly informative but possibly questionable.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZPWdE-GuyY"

howtonotgiveafuck,38y58k,diplocker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:38:09 2015 UTC,I'd be careful with it. Some people apply it topically and it works. But it just aggravated the situation for me. Some also suggest internally and it works well for them. I think it depends on the person but if someone has androgenic acne (Which often appears at the onset of puberty) it's less likely to be effective as compared to digestive acne where it's claimed to help more.  There are generally though a lot of good reviews on it. Just remember to do the research and dilute it before ingesting. It can dissolve the enamel of your teeth if you go crazy with it and start swooshing it in your mouth lol. But generally it's safe and it's a very old house wife remedy.

It was about one guy who had only one arm. He used to be self-conscious about it, like people were judging him for it. But then he realized it was the only physical thing people noticed, so he didn't have to give a fuck anymore. Lettuce in his teeth? Nobody notices, since he has one arm. Dirt on his face? One arm. Torn clothing? One arm.  Same thing could apply to you. Bad skin? Alright, well now nobody notices if you're ugly, or you have dirty clothes on.  Use it as your ""armor.""

howtonotgiveafuck,38vjgn,stoic_buffalo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:48:23 2015 UTC,I would say Fight Club. It's not so much a book on HOW not to give a fuck but rather a thought experiment on how the way you look at things and how you value your life can be both very depressing and freeing depending on your chosen path.
howtonotgiveafuck,38ud4x,iHarryCJ,7,Sat Jun 6 22:15:16 2015 UTC,Recognize shit happens that you can't do a damn thing about.    Try to do some good.

howtonotgiveafuck,38ud4x,Semilocon,4,Sat Jun 6 23:16:04 2015 UTC,"Not giving a fuck is situation-dependent. This is sort of like the free speech that many people think they are entitled to but do not understand. When you do something while not giving a fuck, it really boils down to ""not giving a fuck about the consequences."" If you go in a theater and should out BOMB because you don't give a fuck about the consequences, then great -- You succeeded in not giving a fuck, but you certainly will have to face the consequences. If you make inappropriate comments to your boss because you don't give a fuck, then you will have to suffer the boot.   For most people, the consequences of doing certain acts are based upon how other people see them in a social situation: should i ask this girl out? should i go eat out alone? should i go see this movie alone? should i wear this fashion today?  --- while these decisions have consequences, they are inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, and therefore not giving a fuck probably will not cause too much problems."

Now why would anyone refuse to acknowledge things when the universe throws something at them does not really make much sense. I guess people want to protect themselves, and the easiest way to do this is by being ignorant. It becomes a problem when we realize that we actually don't need to protect ourselves simply because the universe isn't out to get you, rather it is always working to help you. This realization is difficult to come by because most people see the universe as a cold, callous, and dog eat dog. Those that understand that the universe is in favor of you, and not out to eat you alive are usually never ignorant. NGAF is not taking things too seriously if bad things happen, or things don't go how they should. In life both good and bad things happen, and the best attitude to have is to not care about what WILL happen or won't happen. Ignorance is way different than NGAF."

It's not as much about what you're going to be doing daily a year from now as it is about where it will lead you in 5 years, 10 years, 15, etc.   Personally I think the whole way they advertise the military as ""Military is the some of the best job training / experience available"" is a huge marketing scam, from what I've seen, it's pretty much a vortex, you walk into a black hole and walk out a few months / years later and pick your life back up from scratch. This usually ends up with most people getting workforce jobs. If you want a white collar life, you get those jobs due to networking, contacts, workplace experience, going to conferences etc... not just sheer military training on a resume. If you want to be a pilot and you join the Air Force etc. you're probably in pretty good shape, but if you want to be an engineer, go to engineering school."
howtonotgiveafuck,38ggbl,shepherdess00,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:35:20 2015 UTC,"Contrary to some negative comments about the military here, I actually joined and benefitted from it, so here are my 2 cents:  Some people know what they want to be/do from early on, if you still do not know at 21, I would HIGHLY recommend the military. The probability and statistics of getting killed and/or PTSD or very low (a rather small percentage of service members actually see combat).  As someone who doesn't know what they want to do, you will be presented with a TON of jobs and different things to do, ALL of which you will get trained for. Meaning you do not  need to have any prior knoweldge/experience in order to apply for that job (try finding that out in today's job market). Also, depending on branches, you can change jobs halfway through (some conditions may apply depending on the job). When you get out:  Given that you took your service seriously, you now have gained more discipline that you could have ever imagined you could have or need, and life experiences that you just can't get anywhere else, you will have also matured/grown up faster than someone who did not join the military.  Also granted that you took your service seriously, you will have been honorably discharged meaning you have your benefits. If what you did in the military is not something you want to continue as a career as a civilian, you now have the GI Bill that will pay for you to go to school (the new GI Bill will also pay your rent so theoretically you don't even have to work as long as you are in school) and you'll basically be back to square one, but with a ton more life experience and more maturity, and maybe your perspective has changed enough to where you will be able to decide for yourself what you want to study in school or where you want to go in life.    (The GI Bill doesn't only pay for academics, it will pay for trade schools and other specific trades, such as becoming a pilot or something.)    PM me if you have any questions."

howtonotgiveafuck,38gycu,nonhumanperson,2,Thu Jun 4 03:29:17 2015 UTC,"In many ways, how we are defined is based on the work we accomplish and how we appear to others. But definitions are just labels, they are not constraints to our potential. We are not the defined, but we are the definer. The things in your life have value because you define them as valuable. There is no other definition for value than this. You set the goal, you color your experience with hope or disgust. All these things exist as a function of you.   The sacred exists everywhere and nowhere. Some find the sacred in the largest of things, some find the sacred in the smallest of things. The idealists find everything sacred, while the cynic never finds it at all.   Don't spend too much time on trying to live your life according to some image. No matter how well-thought out we believe our lives to be, they are always subject to impermanence. Anything can change at any time, including who we are and what we want to become.

When the prediction is different from the reality, it will become a huge burden to the brain. The brain will feel surprised, sad, and angry. Emotions are self protection mechanisms, keep us from unpredictable dangerous situations.  However, the evolution of our brains can't keep up with the speed we change our world. There are a lot of things our brains can't predict well, like what other people are thinking about. These will become very stressful to us.  One way to deal with it is to stop predicting, especially those things we are very bad at predicting. When you realize the only thing you're angry about is your own bad prediction, it may become less troublesome. Try to focus on things you can predict well, things are in your control.

You can get rid of the spiritual part and focus on basics. Start with a comfortable position, focus on your own breath, this is the most important thing in your life, your life depends on it. If other thoughts enter your mind, just bring your thought back on your breath. Keep practicing.  Self awareness, focus, willpower are like muscle. You can't get strong without practicing, and you should start with simple one like above. You can't wait for some strong emotion happens and start deep breathing, that won't help much.  A book I find very helpful is Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan. You may find it helpful too.  To solve other problems like low self-esteem requires strong self awareness. With strong self awareness it will be easier to ask yourself questions and bring the core issue to the surface. However without self awareness, you'll easily be driven away by your emotions.

What you CAN control is YOUR emotional response to these events. There's a lot you can work with from there. Self reflect. Ask yourself some questions. Why are you so attached to the opinions that other people have of yourself? Or why is it bad for two people to want to have a private conversation which does not include you for whatever reason; it could be they've had an established relationship outside of work and they aren't comfortable discussing some things outside of their social circle. It's not a reflection on you, it doesn't mean you're a bad person, it just means that these two people have a different relationship with each other than they do with other members of your team, which again is outside of your control. Focus on mastering yourself and how to respond to things that happen to and happen around you. Now this doesn't mean become a loner or whatever.

howtonotgiveafuck,383v1i,dblake123,7,Sun Jun 7 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"I've realized this some time ago and would like to add one thing: the need for external validation usually comes from lack of internal validation. We're not sure about ourselves, so we seek approval from others - be it peer group, parents, significant others, anyone really. We're basically waiting for ""yes, you're doing it right"" for our every action. We kind of lose ourselves in that process, maybe not completely, but even giving a small fucky fuck is losing part of yourself - you give part of your brainpower to the situation you probably can't change.  This may sound like a cheesy motivational poster with no merit, but I can speak from my and my friends' experience: you will always give a ton of fucks, unless you stop beating yourself and accept yourself the way you are. Not in a ""yeah, I suck and I won't do anything about this"" way, more like ""I do things in a way I don't like, so let's get to work"". Change won't come overnight, it's a lifelong process, but accepting our flaws and, more importantly, finding our strong parts is the best way to stop giving too many fucks about things that don't deserve being given a single fuck.  Giving a fuck is an easy and negative way of fixing ourselves. Loving yourself is the hard way, but it pays off."

We are slaves to our genetic programming and we're not even conscious about it 99.9% of the time.    Love only feels good because of our reward system is programmed that way by evolution.   If you find the fact that love is bullshit and just random, to be empty and sad. Well consider the fact that once you die, you won't even remember your loved ones or your whole life.

All I can say is it's difficult to leave your loved ones behind, but it is important to remember that your life is important also. Honor her love for you by making decisions that lead you to where she would want you to be, as in happy, healthy, and with someone who loves you.  Old age is a difficult time, and things can change quickly, or stay the same for an agonizing length of time. Watching my grandmother, who was quite the sharp tongued devil herself, waste away and lose her grip on reality to dementia is difficult to even think about, but it reaches a point where being there is harder on you emotionally and physically and you have to take care of yourself. Have your goodbyes, and be sure to say EVERYTHING you need her know about how you feel before you go. Even if you come back and visit, or Skype, it is a great relief to know you've said everything you needed, in case you don't get another chance.

I started to use Tinder and I've gotten a few matches already. There was 1 particular girl I found to be extremely attractive who I became matched with. I sent a funny/lame joke and this girl hasn't responded. However, I have been messaging with other girls so I know I shouldn't care about this girl not responding. But a part of me really wants her to respond.   Like I mentioned before, I don't care too much because I've had others respond and have good conversations with.

howtonotgiveafuck,381du5,dumbcollegekid,24,Mon Jun 1 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"Holy shit! You need to stop giving a fuck about her immediately dude. Let me explain something. Girls have absolutely no investment in Tinder. The desperate ones do, but they mostly just want Instagram followers. Girls get 10x the amount of matches we do. I know matching with a girl can seem like a personal thing, but it's not. Maybe she just wants to see how many matches she can get. Maybe she's actually dating a guy she likes right now. Maybe the joke you sent reminded her of something her ex boyfriend said that made her upset. Maybe she was taking a shit when she read your message and forgot about it because 50 other guys just sent her messages asking for nudes.  Maybe her grandma just died. You have no way of knowing any of that. What it comes down to is it takes a long ass time to find a decent match on there because of all of the variables. After two years and less than 500 matches I've only had two moderately successful dates. It depends on so many factors there's just no way to know. So don't sweat it. Seriously."

Guys are much more visual IMO. All it takes for us to swipe right is ""is she doable?"".  Girls have a bit more thought that goes into swiping right (I'm guessing).  Not to mention what guys are attracted to and what girls are attracted to are totally different things.  The dude above who said that girls get 10x the matches that guys do isn't exaggerating and I think 10x is a lowball figure. On a site like OkCupid where you don't have to match to send a message, girls barely have to do anything but go through their inbox from the moment of signing up. This is all assuming each hypothetical person is at least moderately attractive ofc."

I can think of a handful of things I only like to do by myself or without company.   Perhaps pick up some new hobbies and expand your horizons so you aren't limited to the interests that would make people think that.

You're making an assumption, and the worst possible assumption, at that.  And also: If it's something that, if a friend got close enough to find out, they would think you're a freak, then they're not really a friend. And if non-friends found out, you shouldn't care.   Bottom line: there's no magical thing you can do to instantly release these self-conscious feelings. You just need to own it. So what if you're embarrassed for a day, even a week. You'll get over it, and they'll forget about it.   On a related note: you know that music group called Owl City? And how some consider his music lame, or you're gay if you listen to it? Well, I listen to his music, and I like it. I'm not gay, and I don't care if people think I am because of my taste in music. Because fuck it."

We hadn't talked for a while at that point, so it sucked when that came out of left field. She told me she wanted to catch up some time though, but that never happened and then she went and unfriended me on Facebook and all that bad noise. Honestly, I'm upset that I still care about it.

You obviously put so much trust and love and care into the friendship, which is why you currently feel so wronged. Maybe it's far-fetched to say this... but I don't believe that her ditching you was sudden. I think you kinda suspected it yet chose not to face reality -- call it denial, I suppose. Perfectly fine to be in denial too. You know that saying ""there are many fishes in the sea""? It applies to friendships as well.

howtonotgiveafuck,381du5,KelonjAllDay,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:46:30 2015 UTC,"That sounds really difficult.  1) You can't control your environment to the extent that you won't encounter loud noises.  2) You can control both your perception of the loud noises (wearing headphones/even earplugs as frequently as possible when in public)  3) You can control you brain's response to that sound if you hear it, either with cognitive behavioural therapy, medication, things like service dogs and lifestyle changes which affect what gets you wound up, or some combination of those.  You obviously learned to go into 'panic' or 'fight or flight' mode when you heard a loud noise, so there's going to be a lot of un-learning you have to do in order to get over that. It will take you just as long as it did for you to get into that position.   It might be worth going to your doctor to see what they say say. You're trying to break a cycle of learned behaviour, so if you go on medication for a little while, your body might get a vacation and your brain will stop making that negative connection, and you just stop doing it doen't happen again, even after you stop the medication. (Obviously everyone's different but it might solve the problem).  One thing I learned from a friend of mine is if you're starting having an attack, to try and imagine a perfect scenario where you feel safe, like in a room in your house, in the middle of summer, with the window open, someone's cutting their lawn outside, Ferris Bueller's Day Off is playing on the television but you've got the radio turned on too, listening to the talky-shows your grandparents liked, you've got your favourite book open in your lap...

I'm sure you have your ways of avoiding loudness already, but challenge yourself little by little to the uncomfortable situations/places that you avoid. It'll get better with time. Anxiety is a complicated thing, and I imagine there's more beneath the surface than just not liking loud noises."

I try to find humor in the general things that upset me, that's how I try to cope with them, It's mainly the sting of insults and fear of others that tend make me so shaky and awkward. Hell I even delete comments reaching negative karma out of fear of pissing people off and having them be nasty to me, which is EXTREMELY pathetic of me. Maybe it's lack of self confidence I don't know but I'm trying to get over it."

That guy/girl with the awesome relationship? Person who seems more successful at doing exactly what you do? Teacher, coach, professor, celebrity, guy on the street? They are all just winging it. No - one - knows - what - the - fuck. Sure, people have some plans and goals but they're not 100% free from doubt and worries 100% of the time. This helped me judge the value of someone else's opinion better; they see and think what they are led to believe/see by their frame of mind and previous experiences. You have a frame of mind and previous experiences as well. No one's frame of mind and previous experiences are somehow fundamentally more valuable than another's and no one has their shit sorted out all the way.  For me this made every single aspect of life with other people better, from smalltalk with a store employee to understanding and maintaining close friendships. It even allowed me to make way more meaningful connections with other people because I'm talking with that inner voice everyone has in their head as opposed to talking with the image they constructed of themselves. Does that make sense? Hope it helps and you get to try it a bit."

He doesn't have the power to kick me out, and I ordinarily wouldn't give much of a fuck, especially because he conveys these things pretty rudely and without grounds. But I care about my mother and value her opinions, and she cares about this guy and values his (and excuses him by telling me that ""he just doesn't think about these things,"" which is bullshit), so I end up indirectly giving a fuck even though I really don't want to.  I'm absolutely making progress on reversing that and am maybe 4/5 of the way back to relying on my own self-assessment and the judgment of more decent, reasonable people (feels great), but if anybody has tips, I'd still be interested (hell, it's Saturday morning, so he'll probably come in here with a grievance in a few hours)."

Just think about how you would never treat someone like that, especially if you were in his position. I mean, shouldn't he be kissing your ass because you're his girlfriend's kid. The real problem is your mom's response to his actions. Your mom should be on your side. Name calling is for children. Does your mom now how this affects you? If you smell bullshit, you're probably right. You know what is right and wrong, so stand up for yourself. Chances are, this boyfriend isn't going to last forever, but you and your mom will be, so get straight with her. You don't deserve to be treated badly. I don't know how old you are, but you wont have to deal with mom and boyfriend relationships forever. If you don't respect him as a person, don't respect what he has to say.

Two thoughts:  Relax; be willing to miss things. Focusing too intently for fear of not hearing something is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The less your mind's going ""but what if I don't hear X?/I really need to hear X,"" the better your chance of being attentive enough to hear X.   Also, folks who matter are likely also those who can be told about your problem and who will be willing to accommodate it. Likewise, important things are things that can be repeated multiple times and/or written down. That shitty hearing is a filter, if an involuntary one, that's giving you a sense of people's character and what they say a little quicker than someone else."

howtonotgiveafuck,381du5,thegrasingsheep,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:00:37 2015 UTC,"I have said this somewhere else before:  There are two main assumptions that poison most social interaction: (1) The people I talk to are smarter/more competent/more articulate/more supercalifragilisticexpialidocious than I am. So naturally, I need to watch what I am saying lest I want to be judged. (2) The people I talk to don't have social anxieties of their own. Now, and this might shock you, but both statements are pretty much false all of the time. I have come across a lot of wonderful (and less wonderful) people and everyone around you (and yes, I mean that, everyone!) is plagued by insecurities and all the issues that getting through the day brings with it. Conversely, ask yourself this: If ""others"" are also struggling with insecurities, self-hatred, a constant need of wanting to belong and all that jazz, is it really a ""me vs. them"" situation rather than a case of ""let's all be scared together""? People who do best in the ""cool"" department are usually people who really don't care that much in the first place (and I think those people can afford not to care so much, because they understand that we all are pretty much lost 90% of the time.

Instead, care enough about them to acknowledge that they are far from cool and charismatic - they might have more life experience, but no matter how old someone is, social anxieties are part of the human experience (if anything, there are just varying degrees of how pronounced these anxieties are, but we all have them).   So in a very real sense, you already are like them. Focus on that common ground rather than outlining what makes them so (seemingly) different from you. It will help you relax to realize that, sure, this one older person might be extremely comfortable with talking to a young 'un such as yourself, but will second-guess himself when talking to his father-in-law or his other peers.

The code needs to be demoed tomorrow, so the best solution is simply not viable, and there are more important things I need to be working on right now for the demo. This bug is, in my opinion, trivial.  So my choices are: fix it the wrong way, or don't fix it right now. Either way, he'll attack me for choosing the wrong way, which is of course so fucking easy to say when he doesn't examine all the other constraints. Or, he'll attack me for not fixing it or being ""too lazy.""  And this is where the gaslighting bit is pretty interesting, because neither of his attacks appear wrong to management.

This person is toxic and one way or another needs to be removed from your life as soon as possible.

You need to own that shit.  Are there people better than you?  Sure but who cares.  You're not competing with Paul Mitchell you're competing with the worst stylists on the planet and you're going to crush them.  You're better educated you care more and dammit you are good enough.  You're new, you're not the greatest in the world... yet.  Your clients aren't going to the greatest stylists in the world... as far as they know but you can show them they are.   You might be the greatest in the world someday but not if you hold yourself down.    Sure you might fuck up but everyone does.  It's not IF you fuck up big but when and it all comes down to what you do in that moment that defines who you really are.  Someone is going to move, someone is going to lie to you and shit is going to get fucked up.  If you throw in the towel at that point it will be your fault for destroying yourself.  Don't be that person.   Be that awesome motherfucker you are.  Own that shit.  It's yours if you take it.  There's a saying ""the whole world is a petting zoo if you're willing to pet it"".  Be that person, pet the world.  No one got awesome by thinking they suck.  Fake it till you make it if you have to but honestly you've made it you just don't know it.   Seriously tomorrow you get up and when that voice in your head says ""you suck"" get pissed, get just as pissed as you would if someone said that to you.  You would never let someone tell you that you suck because you know it's not true so why do you lie to yourself.    Punch the shitty you in the face and make shit happen like you know it can.  Celebrate your successes.   When you do great be happy.  Smile.  High five.  You gotta take credit for the wins not just the losses.    tl;dr my wife is a massage therapist and she's like you.

howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,samferber3,77,Fri May 29 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"Sharing your life step by step on social media. I see it all the time. People who let you know they went on a run, had a good breakfast, and went to boring old work on the weekday or brunch and the beach on the weekend. Or they just applied to something (grad school et. al.) and screenshot their submission. If you're not gonna give a fuck, you wouldn't post on social media at all. But since that isn't likely to happen, you should at least post about stuff you DID, not banal shit you're DOING. No on gives a fuck if you're bored at work, again. But if you've been running for the past two months without telling anyone and today you post a before and after pic of you minus 20lbs, that's impressive. Or you applied to a new job or grad school and stayed mum till you got it, that's cool too. A sign of insecurity is in general telling people what you're planning to do or want to do. And those same people might discourage you from your plans by being apathetic or telling you they don't think it's possible/a good idea. Fuck that, just shut your trap, do the fucking thing, and tell no one until you can see results - which by then other people should have noticed and commented first. Just do you. First foremost and always, do you. For example, I just started exercising again after many failed attempts. This time around I ain't wasting no time telling people I'm doing it. My only focus is to actually DO it. And my goal is to look good by my birthday in December. Everyone else and their "" you said that last time "" bullshit can go fuck themselves - I don't need that negativity in my life right now.  Oversharing your abilities while talking to people. I catch myself doing this all the time, and it comes from a subconsciously deep desire to be liked by others, which pushes me to work my achievements into conversation. I think this is the other side of the coin to Number 1. I've been getting better at just listening to people and asking them about themselves while offering up no info of my own, unless they ask for it or its relevant. Relevance here is also key - what you share should show that you empathize with the other person, not that you have a story just like theirs. Done in excess, the latter comes off as trying to one-up the other person. For example, if someone is telling me about their trip to Paris, I'll talk about how awesome it must have felt to be there, and ask them to tell me about the food, the clubs, the culture, if they went to a specific café where the French intelligentsia met back in the day., etc. I WONT talk about how I can speak French and have read Camus. Nobody needs to know that shit, and if you think they do - you give a fuck. I've been getting better at it but I'm not there yet. What I have found is that not talking about my achievements makes me a better judge of someone else's character. Think about it - if you're talking to someone and they have no idea who you are or what you can do, their reaction to you is much more honest. They have no preconceived notions of you and thus the way they'll treat you will be an indicator of how they treat others in general. If they're kind, friendly and easy going, that's who they are. If they're arrogant and build themselves up, that's who they are. This makes it much easier to choose friends wisely imho. Long story short, keep your trap shut.  Not trying something new, especially something that doesn't call your attention right off the bat. Trying new things has been addressed here before - the whole ""Idgaf if I'm a horrible dancer, Imma join a salsa class anyways"" idea. But someone who says that already had an interest in dancing, they just were afraid to get into it because of their insecurities. What I'm talking about is doing something you didn't think you'd have done before. For example, I love the more traditional arts of performance and dance and art. I have no real passion for the STEM fields, but I've recently started using CodeAcademy to teach myself how to code. When I told some of my closest friends (who know how artsy I am) they incredulously asked ""Why?"" My response was ""Why the fuck not?"" Even if I don't create the next Instagram, coding works out the logic-and-reasoning side of my brain, which I've woefully neglected. And you can create cool artistic shit with it as well so ... why the fuck not ? Imho everyone should try something out of left field and not give a fuck. Since when has extra knowledge been a bad thing ? It can only make you a better person in the long run.    I think I've been on my soapbox long enough haha, take this as you will.   EDIT: I spilled out some of my own achievements and things I want to do in this comment. How ironically meta lol.  EDIT 2: Me at being gilded"

howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,Hip-pie,3,Sat May 30 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair: I used to think stuff like posting workouts or healthy ways was obnoxious too- but in the case of running, at least- on one of the apps, every time someone ""likes"" your post, your phone lets out a little crowd roar cheer. That makes me push myself harder and not quit since I'm ""accountable"" to other people.   I agree with the bulk of your post, and see how it can work both ways, but I no longer judge people who post about doing cool things since it's a positive affirmation thing for me when I do it."
howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,mrwhalejr,9,Thu May 28 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"That's really cool that your app does that and I'm glad its working out for you!   But do you mind if I play devils advocate ? What that app is doing for you is the same as what likes/retweets/etc, do for other people - they condition you into a positive feedback loop, where your input is your action (running) it's effect is the likes + cheers which increases your input (you run more). Like you said yourself, you're now 'accountable' to people. But what would you do if the likes stopped coming? Would that send you into negative feedback, where you steadily decrease your running because the arbitrary likes have petered out ?   I guess my point would be that one should strive to find intrinsic motivation to accomplish goals such that outside encouragement/discouragement does very little for you. Therefore anything you share would be more of a factual 'here is what I'm doing/have done take it or leave it' rather than an inquiring 'here is what I'm doing/have done what do you think?' It's not a judgment either way, because if you need that outside push to get you going and pick you up when you're down, more power to you. Whatever works for you, do it.

The sneakiest of all though.... i had a friend who was thoroughly convinced he didnt have an ego. so he started giving a fuck about making sure people knew he didn't have an ego. got a big head over ""not having an ego"". that's giving a whole more fucked up kind of fuck. it all gets very complicated, the small sneaky fucks people give when they're trying so hard not to. you just gotta let all those fucks drop like dead leaves and one day you look back and your like oh... my egos gone! cool! but that takes a lot of time and patience. the end result is worth it though. deciding to stop giving a fuck actually led me on this whole spiritual journey because when you decide to stop giving a fuck you get closer to your true center of the Self."

howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,Osricthebastard,5,Thu May 28 20:34:54 2015 UTC,"You can't destroy the ego because if you did you'd sit at home staring at a wall all day and only rarely get up to eat or shit when your body tells you that you have to. The ego is essential towards having any sort of personality, drive, or desires.  Ego is a good thing. But the ego MUST be kept in check. And THAT is the goal. To keep it from turning in to a monster."

Egotistic bastard is just a term used to describe narcissistic individuals who work only for themselves. Is that immoral? Depends on how you see the world.   Crap.

howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,Osricthebastard,1 point,Fri May 29 07:49:07 2015 UTC,"Morality isn't subjective it's very rational. Altruism is good for the species and selfishness drags the species (and often the whole planetary ecosystem ) down. This isn't something that's up for debate. Narcissism is bad. Period.  Not to mention from a purely selfish point of view, narcissism greatly damages the ability of the narcissist to form and maintain decent human relationships. The inability to critically self analyze can effect career potential and advancement in the world. It can be a monumentally destructive force in the narcissists life."

Anger, sadness, frustration, longing; are generally the emotions we feel right before we say ""I don't even give a fuck.""  Making a post about it also makes a good case that you actually do give a fuck."
howtonotgiveafuck,37kwaq,heypipiopi,3,Thu May 28 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Here's a few symptoms (and examples) of GAF you might see pop up:   Doing things you don't like but feel you are obligated to (going to a wedding/party when you'd rather be somewhere else) Caring about your appearance (Don't leave the house unless you're looking stylish and smelling fresh) Explaining yourself to others or arguing (I need him to understand why I'm right and he's wrong!) Disliking or judging other individuals or groups (That asshole cut me off on the highway, she must be a real asshole) Being self-conscious (I want to sing karaoke, but I can't... I have a terrible singing voice) Being afraid (whatever you are afraid of, you give a big fuck about, otherwise you wouldn't be afraid of it)   Do not judge yourself about anything on this list you identify with - you can't not give a fuck about anything, it's impossible.  Do your best to be conscious and deliberate about what you give a fuck about.  For instance, you may not give a fuck about dressing stylishly, but if you have a big interview for a job you want, it's in your best interest to dress to the nines.  Great question OP, this is an important topic for everyone to consider.  EDIT: Additional words for clarity"

howtonotgiveafuck,37jb7l,danxmason,12,Thu May 28 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"Im probably gonna get excessively deep, but hey: Its all about being a Fool. Fools are people who act autonomously, without concern for what others think of them. Being foolish is actually really looked highly upon. Acting with confident indifference is an archetype people enjoy being around typically. Humans are actually pretty social, and most people (if not all) are desperately trying to enjoy their life. Showing people confident indifference lets them see that quality in themselves and lets everyone around you better feel at ease. Dont take things seriously, just question and talk about assumptions, enjoying the ride will inspire others to enjoy you enjoying the ride. People like watching others have a good time, so pretending everything is fine will convince people it is true. In life you can either act autonomously or you can act collaboratively. Both are essential to act out in order to get people to enjoy you. Getting the willpower to not care though, that comes from habit. Just ask people the time, ask people directions, get sued to talking to people. Humans are just like you. We're all desperately trying to get along in life according to our own autonomous values while needing to collaborate with other people. Convincing others that you are chill and easy to be around is a great skill to get good at. I've been practicing for a while, and It's chill as fuck. You'd be suprised how far a question like ""How was your day?"" or ""Whats your favorite color?"" will get you. It just builds confidence, then you go on to bigger better social engagements. Either you will succeed in being social or you wont."
howtonotgiveafuck,37jb7l,DrDeath008,1 point,Thu May 28 08:10:01 2015 UTC,Pre programmed indifference is a pretty interesting idea. I guess it sorta comes down to being able to sell yourself as an authentic and enjoyable person. Thats how people become different to you.

howtonotgiveafuck,37jb7l,DrDeath008,2,Fri May 29 03:54:07 2015 UTC,"There are two main assumptions that poison most social interaction:  (1) The people I talk to are smarter/more competent/more articulate/more supercalifragilisticexpialidocious than I am. So naturally, I need to watch what I am saying lest I want to be judged.  (2) The people I talk to don't have social anxieties of their own.  Now, and this might shock you, but both statements are pretty much false all of the time.   I have come across a lot of wonderful (and less wonderful) people and everyone around you (and yes, I mean that, everyone!) is plagued by insecurities and all the issues that getting through the day brings with it.   Conversely, ask yourself this: If ""others"" are also struggling with insecurities, self-hatred, a constant need of wanting to belong and all that jazz, is it really a ""me vs. them"" situation rather than a case of ""let's all be scared together""?   People who do best in the ""cool"" department are usually people who really don't care that much in the first place (and I think those people can afford not to care so much, because they understand that we all are pretty much lost 90% of the time. This goes for the jock, the nerd, the cheerleader, the CEO and all the other cliches you can think of)"
howtonotgiveafuck,37jb7l,ThomasKoenig,1 point,Fri May 29 07:03:49 2015 UTC,"Bare with me. How old are you?   I find that I am all the calmer when u understand more about what's going on. Like for me, awareness beats anxiety. I'm anxious when I am in a position where I can be made to look foolish for instance. But when I'm comfortable with what I'm doing I'm not likely to be anxious.   I ask how old are you because egocentrism is common in the 13-20 year olds bracket, and early 20s too. But it can go in to later adulthood. If you haven't heard or before it is the phenomenon of believing everyone cares about you as much as you do! ""I care about how I look, smell, and act, therefore everybody else does too, and to the same degree"". This mentality can lead to anxiety.  So take a step back. Make yourself comfortable in your scenario and remember nobody cares about you as much as they care about themselves"

Two years later I finished the course perfect grades although I got weaker and tired towards the end. It meant paying a lot of attention to the work, you can't cruise it so when you feel like a weirdo for how much you're concerned with the work just keep going (shoot for the moon, end up as an average smart kid).    So I wasn't too bothered about what other people thought because I had an absolute direction, and I think they appreciated that too. You don't have to talk about it, if someone asks what you're doing just tell them, if they want an explanation just give it as matter-of-fact. Nobody is going to really care though, your family will probably settle down after a short period at the start."

howtonotgiveafuck,379eef,AngelLeliel,3,Wed May 27 10:08:40 2015 UTC,"What I learned from a bad breakup is that you can't blame yourself too much, I struggled thinking it was all my fault after the first breakup for a few months, but you just gotta hang in there, eventually you will shake the feeling.  Initially I was good for a month after the breakup, yes I was still wrecked emotionally but I was getting better, until I log into facebook one day, roughly one month after she dumped me, and she was in a relationship with someone else! That really made me feel shitty because when she dumped me she said it was because she didn't have time and didn't want to seek a relationship. Eventually I was able to let go, but I finally received closure when I saw them break up shortly after they were facebook official, then I started hearing rumors that she's known for not being able to maintain a stable relationship, that's when I realized that I wasn't in the wrong and that it probably wasn't my fault at all. I still sometimes will have a thought cross my mind about how much it sucks, but you just gotta keep those negative feelings in check by having healthy outlets. I began playing a lot of pickup basketball and working out more frequently with my extra time after getting dumped and it really helped give my mind a break, I don't know how it is for you but for me when I play a sport, recreational or competitive, I can hyperfocus on that sport while I'm playing and it helped me not think about being dumped when I was still recovering.

I kind of recently confessed that I still had feelings for an ex in a long message on Facebook and got brutally shot down. I know it's my own fault but I feel like shit for it.
howtonotgiveafuck,379eef,Battler11,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:54:17 2015 UTC,"That's a tough one, I have a rule of thumb of not sending things like that via message. I guess you just gotta shake that one off and not worry about whether or not it was your fault. Shit happens, but you're still alive. If you've worried about it wrecking your chances with her, don't worry. If you and her broke up then there's no reason to get back together, it just wasn't meant to be. I will say oneitis is a lethal but curable disease, once you find a way around oneitis then you can come to peace with what has already happened, then you will find the power to finally move on. Keep looking up and you will find that inner peace."

This is an opportunity to take some time and find out what is truly important to you. Once you figure that out then you can not give a fuck about the rest. That's what this whole sub and philosophy is about. It's a process man, doesn't happen overnight but it will happen if you change habits and continue pursuing your purpose.

Instead of having ""lose weight"" as a goal, decide to lose 10 lbs by the end of July, but cutting out sodas, bread, and desserts & exercising 2 times a week.  Instead of having ""study"" as a goal, decide to get a 90 or greater on your next test or assignment, by resolving to read and take notes of at least one chapter a night, and review the previous nights notes for 30 minutes.   This methodology has helped me immensely! As the overused quote goes: ""goals without deadlines are just dreams"""

When I was in high-school, my whole forehead was covered with acne and you can imagine the number of people that told me to get it sorted out. It didn't help that I was chubby due to midnight junk-food.  When those strangers told me all of these remarks, the thought process in my head went something like this: well no shit, of course i know i have acne and that's why i have a fringe to hide it. i know i am fat but i am 16 and people my age need to eat a lot because we can still grow.  Halfway into my first year of university, I asked myself once more: I cannot give myself anymore excuses like I did when I am 16. My parents are overseas and I always said that if I was given freedom, I can actually take care of myself. Well look at yourself, you are not losing much weight, and your face has not cleared up. didn't you say yourself that once you have control of your life (financially, and other -ally), you will get it sorted? My face has cleared up significantly and I don't have really have any pimples to worry of. I loss some weight but I haven't develop the discipline to exercise more regularly. What helped me was eating less snacks and junk-food, you feel less bloated and you look less bloated after several months. I started cutting out salt (salt is alright but moderation and not in excess.) and try to cook food that isn't instant noodle or sunny side up."

howtonotgiveafuck,36s5p7,prototype31695,4,Fri May 22 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"When your working or improving yourself, do it for yourself. Self improvement is not dependent on how others see that improvement. You can better yourself (for yourself) and still not got give a fuck about how others see you. Now it may seem like self improvement for you involves an undermining lack of self acceptance from your current state. That also is not true because a person can recognize the desire of change and still accept how that change will affect them, both in the state that is desired and in the state that is being changed."
howtonotgiveafuck,36s5p7,jimbopimpo1,3,Sun May 24 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"I think that when you're trying to change the message the ""tape recorder in your head"" is playing, there's always a ""one step forward, two steps backward"" kind of thing going on. By ""tape recorder in your head"" I mean the messages you've internalized from parents, teachers, friends, co-workers, etc. Examples include ""I'm smart"" ""I'm fat and ugly"" ""I'm a bad driver""   So I think there's going to be an element of you being into looking good for the sake of others, if that's been true for you in the past. The important thing is to keep it on a downward trend.   I've learned through cognitive-behavioral psychology that you can't simply eliminate the thought you don't want. So, if the thought is ""I'm weak"" you can replace it with ""Wait, no I'm not. I've come to the gym twice this week. I used to not go to the gym at all. So I'm stronger than I was 3 months ago!"" or something similar. Maybe something shorter ..."

I try my hardest to be a better person than I was yesterday, so losing weight is a necessity because I know I'm overweight (I accept that I'm overweight for now and accept the body I'm dealing with for another year) and I will soon be better than I once was ( finally healthy) and with even more acceptance because it'll eventually turn into loving myself. I don't love the person I see and that I am as of now.   Just don't give a damn about what people think about you and just try to work towards being healthy. People need daily exercise so definitely have a dose of exercise into your life. It's about being healthy at this point because you love the rush that exercise gives you and about accepting the person you are now. It's okay to put a hold on something to achieve the other, then you're able to use both philosophies and incorporate them both into your life at the same time. Sounds weird but I hope that made sense."

Lucky to be blessed with a quick metabolism, so keeping the weight off after high school hasn't been a problem, though the relationship issue hasn't changed much  Honestly, getting out more is the most important thing. What year are you? Junior going on senior? Got plenty of time this summer, not to mention opportunities in the fall to meet and befriend people. I always played the humble fool; act silly and weird while amiable and people will like you around. Strong personalities have attractive power, and I'm not talking sexual attraction, though it helps.  I had an odd degree of ""popularity"" in high school in that I was the turtle that came out of his shell, but it kind of happened by accident. Essentially you could say I got involved with the wrong crowd, but they had been long established friends that I reconnected with in ways they didn't think a nerd like me could have fun. Honestly, join something like cross country or wrestling. The way me and and old teammate would put it is that it's an amalgamation of misfits.   Wrestling you have all of the different weight classes and year statuses, so everyone on the team is a different size and age.  And cross country is great for staying in shape, and while you are forced to exercise, as they say misery loves company, and your teammates will share in the suffering and struggle.  I only hit the skin depth level of my potential response to you, please reply if you want to talk any more. The teen formative years of high school are tricky, and social development is actually one of the core skills they don't teach in class."

You can indeed change if people tell you that or not.  It is far easier to NGAF if they don't annoy you with their shit. If you're interested in this, keep on reading:  What everybody tells you is that there are always people who dislike you for nonsense reasons. This is true. What nobody tells you is that there a simple ways to stop those assholes from mocking you.  Your confidence is the difference-maker. The two simplest ways to a) be more confident and b) show more confidence are the following:   [walk correctly](www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fD2TSL2s7I) and create and hold eye-contact   I was guilty of bad posture and escaping eye contact and therefore was bullied in high school.  In an upward circle i improved my body language and got more confident. In the beginning I was submissive towards those bullies (while I thought I was confident), a year later every bully was submissive to me. (Some of them had so much respect for me they were ready to eat punches to protect me.)  Watch the video, practice the right walking technique for 5-10 minutes. Look your bullies in the eyes, not with an angry face and not to win a staring contest, but do it.  They will at least(!) stop to mock you."

That is until they physically touch/abuse you, at that point defend yourself and punch them in the head (or whatever), you may lose the fight, but they'll most likely stop fucking with you once they realize you'll fight back.  Spend your energy trying to befriend kids that don't make fun of you. I know it can be hard, I was teased some in school. You just gotta persevere through life, once you get to college it should all reset like it did for me.  Also remember there's nothing wrong with you, they will find things to mock and tease no matter what.

Eventually I changed the things about myself that I didn't like but also found people who liked the things about me that I didn't want to change. Eventually most people find 'their people'. I find that my friends now (I'm in my late 20s) are almost invariably the ones who were similarly awkward and unpopular when they were young.  Also, about the porn addiction: unless you've had a diagnosis from a therapist who is sex positive and open to porn and masturbation as a normal kind of sexual expression, you probably don't have a porn addiction. Most men watch porn every day and masturbate, and many women do too. Nothing wrong with it, as long as you're not letting it interfere with your life and you don't contribute money or page views to porn that exploits people (e.g. featuring non-consenting participants, people who feel pressured, minors, etc)."

But, I also think this post illustrates a larger problem with social media in general: the fact that people depict their ideal life and ideal selves online. This is problematic because those people aren't necessarily being honest with themselves or their loved ones about some struggles they might be facing (it's often very difficult to genuinely ask for help and seek meaningful support online).  And this makes social media very misleading for everyone else. Because people don't genuinely open up or make themselves vulnerable on social media, but instead curate their lives to me what they wish it were, it makes everyone else assume that their lives are mediocre at best in comparison. Then they become self-conscious, further curate and idealize online, and the cycle continues.   Further reading:    I live in PA currently, and Madison Holleran's suicide was a huge news story last year. Over the past few weeks, there've been several additional articles on her death, mostly discussing the discrepancy between her life as it was perceived by everyone else (she was a beautiful young woman and a star athlete at Penn) and her life as she actually lived it, struggling with depression. And these newest articles focus on her life as she portrayed it on her Instagram account. You can see the ESPN article here.  I also really like this article on why GenY kids are so unhappy. It pays particular attention to social media."

howtonotgiveafuck,365nja,reynolds753,4,Sun May 17 13:28:30 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head.  I like Facebook because it's a way for me to see what the people who matter to me are up to, and it's also a way for me to feel like I still have a social connection with old friends from college/high school who I wouldn't otherwise connect with. It's been problematic for me in the past, but at this point I only post if I have something I really need to say or something strikes me as interesting enough that I want to share it with specific people."

I think if you're just 'living life' and doing your thing, not worrying about the website, there is no reason to delete it.  But most people obsessively check their phones on the bus, upload pictures of themselves and live in a digital false reality.   I personally haven't used the platform for anything but messaging and promoting my books for about 6 months, but even that started to annoy me.   The thing that motivated me to make the leap is that I started mentoring people on living deeper lives, and I cannot do so if I don't do what I preach myself.   I'm also curious to see what I am doing with my time if I don't have anything to check."

I've refined our marketing to be largely successful without the use of paid ads.   I use my personal Facebook sparingly. I don't get many messages and tend to avoid drama, etc and keep myself planted elsewhere. To me, it's a tool to be used, not something to be avoided.

Such is with me, but it is because that is what I have chosen. Real life in the meatspace is a parallel story, and your experiences can be just as shallow and meaningless unless you endeavor to change that.   But of course, it is always a choice. If you are happy with what you chose, then it is good. I'm not trying to judge you on this or anything. I just wish to highlight that Facebook isn't the problem, it's mostly the human condition.   Not trying to devalue anything you said, you've said a lot stuff that rings true. Peace."

Many video games, websites, and other projects are a result of tons of people using these sites and becoming friends and first of later.  If this means some cools things wont get done in the future then thats disappointing.... You can interact faster with like minded people on the internet than randomly in public.  In public there is no /subreddit on this street or location...and if there was you cant move as fast to the next 'subreddit' of interest.

I laugh at their need to insult me, because if they took the time to think up a witty insult, I must be that much further ahead of them. I am at peace with myself and know myself better than anyone around me. If one insult is particularly true, I embrace it. For example: Yes, I am an asshole. The same asshole that is currently happy to be headed headed home from my job paying twice what most people my age make, and when I get home, my girlfriend of five years will be there to greet me. I think the key to not giving a fuck is to focus on the positive side of every situation, and keep the negative in the back of your head.

""It bothers John, who you like hanging out with.""  ""I will try to swear less when John is around.""  See the difference? :-)  One excellent HNTGAF approach is General Semantics.

This type of criticism allows us to see how we can improve in our work, social, and personal life. Now the criticism you shouldn't give a fuck is non-constructive. Why? Because it usually derives from personal emotions. One person may say your work sucks, without an explanation. Most of these are based upon an individual feeling that they're inadequate. In order to make themselves feel better, they put others down.   Now this is just my perspective.  Good luck! Stay Strong :) Hope this helped you"

I've been doing nothing but writing music and poetry since I've gotten fired. I always found college to be a waste of time for someone like me, but now that I'm dead sure of what I want for myself, I've applied to a liberal arts school that I'm dead sure will take me there. I'll probably rack up quite some debt.  You don't have to do anything. Now or ever. You get to do whatever the fuck you want to do. Fuck anyone who says otherwise. I'm dead serious.

howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,gerardogram,25,Tue May 5 10:19:20 2015 UTC,Balance  Sometimes short-term pain is required for long-term gain.  Balance
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,Aldring,10,Mon May 4 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes yes. But not all the time for goddsake!   Do you think ""elderly you"" will say ""I wish she'd worked harder so I could be in a better nursing home?""  No. She won't. Because people in nursing homes no longer give any fucks at all. They can't. They don't have any to spare.  So yes, balance is appropriate. The point is, enjoy yourself now because you can't enjoy yourself at any other time. This may sound simplistic to you, but you'd be surprised how few people are really enjoying their lives. The happy people are disproportionally high in this sub perhaps, but in some, they're dying like flies confused and ashamed and unhappy."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,gerardogram,7,Mon May 4 23:34:54 2015 UTC,"No argument that many people are living in misery. And balance doesn't mean that you don't enjoy your life. It simply means that you don't get to do what you want all the time. Life requires give and take. Unless you choose to live outside of normal life, without a care for material things of any nature, without desire for some semblance of secure food, clothing and shelter. For some, this is what they want from life. But for the vast majority, we find a balance (hopefully tilted toward enjoyment) between what we want to do and what we have to do. Sometimes what we have to do things that are enjoyable but are necessary. To use your example, I have to do somethings now so that when I am older and can't, I am taken care of.  I think the point, 'don't keep doing what you hate because you feel trapped', is a good one. In spite of how overused it is, you do only get one shot at this."

I would still be at home playing video games or something. Sometimes following your dream involves going through tons of shit you don't want to do. The best rewards often come through shit.  The fact of life is: your quality of happiness will be a lot greater if you make some temporarily less happy investments. If you only think about the here and now, you'll eventually end up being less happy."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,dnew,5,Mon May 4 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"This is completely untrue. You can trust your instincts without having to think about everything you do. Choosing to make current investments so you can be happier later is your choice, and it is most certainly not the only path.  I'm sure that if past you wasn't keeping future you in mind, you would be happy in a completely different way. There is no happiness scale. Your happiness is infinite. When and how you choose to access it is your own choice if that is what you want. You will feel shame for feeling happy sometimes, but that's just something else to let go of. Emotional freedom is the only way to truly be happy. Forgive me if you must, but I think all the shit you went through is worthless on its own, just as your current lifestyle is, just as all of ours are. Do you want to accomplish happiness? Do it now, but realize if you're rejecting or grasping an idea purely based on shame. Every moment in eternity is worthless except to the moment that it is."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,Toront0,-7,Tue May 5 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"so he could enjoy the amazing life I have now   Do you see what's wrong with this sentence? ""He"" is no longer with us. ""Past you"" does not get to enjoy the amazing life you have now because Past You is long gone. All he got to experience was the life the past past you had worked or not worked for. From what you say, it hasn't been a bed of roses. I'm sorry.   The fact of life is: your quality of happiness will be a lot greater if you make some temporarily less happy investments.   WHOA! This is hardly a ""fact of life"" or a fact of any kind. It is an opinion and nothing more. and it is not the result of a scientific inquiry.  Lastly,for a person in this sub, you are giving an awful lot of fucks. I don't know how many fucks a person has to give here before the mods ban you, but it probably isn't in the double-digits.   Sometimes following your dream involves going through tons of shit you don't want to do. The best rewards often come through shit.   I question these assumptions very seriously. How do you calculate the dross:happy ratio over a lifetime? What % of your time has been spent happy versus % of your life doing something you'd rather not?   If you only think about the here and now, you'll eventually end up being less happy.   This is another opinion I do not share. In my case, however, it is more of a fact. This is because I had a horrible, fucked up childhood surrounded by crazy shit and I grew up angry. I couldn't believe 2 people who had created such a petty, nasty, hateful, meaningless, joyless, fearful, abusive and loveless life for themselves had brought another creature into their world but there I was and I was pissed.  They taught me nothing. I had to figure it all out. They didn't even teach me the language of the country I was in since they were immigrants. The idea that life could be enjoyed never came up. It took me a hella long time to learn to live happy and not giving a few fucks had a lot to do with it. That's all I'll say."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,Zin-Zin,7,Mon May 4 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"I think there's a disconnect in this logic that there's a separation between Past/Present/Future selves. (And where does Past Self stop and Present Self begin, yesterday? A minute ago? A second ago?) If there is such a disconnect...If you are not your Past self, then where did all the memories come from? How do you know to write English? Any scars? Where'd you get them? Those are all a part of you. And they are a part of you because you are now your Past Future Self.   And the same goes for your Future Self. My future self will inherit the choices that I make today. The actions that I take today. I'm old enough to be able to see what would have happened if I had made a different choice in my life. I don't regret, but I do learn. And my Present Self is Yesterday's Future Self, and Yesterday's Future Self can see how making the enjoyable choice all the time does not help the Whole Self thrive. Because the Whole Self wants to develop in a way that takes more time than the individual moment. See what I mean?   But I agree with you that some people get lost and end up doing something that they don't enjoy for way too long.   (Top Tip: Avoid such sweeping generalizations that include everyone, like ""We have been tricked into working by our Future Selves."" B/c all it takes to blow your 'argument' wide open is to point out one person who actually enjoys their job in the present moment.)   I think you're remedy--just do what you enjoy--is a bit short-sighted. By all means most people should avoid doing something they hate. The way I see things now...I see where I want to be in 5 years. And why do I want to be there? Because it is a challenge to me. When I get there, it means that I have grown as an individual, that I have reached more of my potential. That's important to me, it's enjoyable to me, but not in every moment along the way. Sometimes I have to sacrifice my Present Self's enjoyment of the moment for a bit of hardwork. But he's OK with it. I talked to him and though he doesn't enjoy it in the moment, he knows its better for everyone involved if he makes that sacrifice. And he knows it makes him a better person. And one day, a Past Future Self will thank him, though Completely Past Self is a bit envious he didn't make the choice earlier.   See what I mean?"
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,michelswennson,1 point,Tue May 5 03:27:33 2015 UTC,"where did all the memories come from?   Memory is a record of all past events that have impinged upon our brains. It is also known as conditioning.  There is not an entity called Self that persists through time. That would contradict the laws of physics. The self of right now will not be there tomorrow but the consequences of its actions will, just as you say.  The only important point in my post is that we can only enjoy ourselves in the present. Perhaps most people already know this and are able to live accordingly and have happy lives. For me, it was a big revelation."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,jollychimp,3,Mon May 11 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry you had to live such a life with those people. I can see how the HNTGAF philosophy is a good way to deal with that. It's definitely a good thing to not give a fuck about what other people think about us, or about how they try to influence us to change our decisions. That's what this sub is most properly about, I think. When I learned HNTGAF, I was able to break free from the hold my parents and the people from my community had on me and do what I really had a passion for.  But there are still some things that we should give a fuck about. We should care about others, about what's best for those around us, and try to help them whenever we can. That includes our Future Self.  I'll take a simple example: smoking. I've been a smoker in the past. Every cigarette, in that moment, made me happy. But in the time immediately after smoking, I was much less happy. (My health was affected, my testosterone levels dropped, I had less money to spend on basic necessities and even other, more lasting pleasures.)  Now that I've quit smoking, I'm much happier. I can literally breathe easier. But that doesn't mean that I wouldn't enjoy a cigarette right now if I smoked one. I just have to delay that gratification so that I can experience a more lasting and fulfilling one."
howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,gerardogram,1 point,Tue May 5 08:30:13 2015 UTC,"You're correct. My views aren't as rigid as my post makes them seem. I'm still struggling to undo all the mistakes made by a wild and irresponsible Past Me and I've decided to be more thoughtful towards Future Me.  Nevertheless, the main point I was trying to make is sound. We can only enjoy ourselves in the present. Many people have forgotten this and postpone their lives indefinitely, planing to finally enjoy them in the future. And the future never arrives."

howtonotgiveafuck,34v1b6,r314t,5,Tue May 5 03:33:49 2015 UTC,"There is a German pronoun that states:""If everybody is selfish, nobody is forgotten.""  To NGAF properly, it is required, that you never do something predicated on other peoples recognition or respect, as you fixate your happiness on an outside event, of which you have no control.   Rather be in a constant reflection of your own interests, as your inner voice will negotiate the right balance between ""Now"" and ""Future me"". It will tell you, what you should do. Bitterness and regret only arise, if you constantly ignore your own interest.   So to be happy.. Just live in the moment. As I say.. ""If you live everyday without regret, you don't have to have any claims/expectations for 'future you', as it is unsure."""

That's a hard fact, unless you were born enlightened. If you HAVE PLANS, then you HAVE PLANS. that's another one. Being happy is not a plan. It's an emotion. It's there with you always. You can access is it WHENEVER. I repeat, WHENEVER you want to.   Do you have plans? Do you know what you want? Two completely different questions. Completely irrelevant. Hard work is not the natural order. Change is the natural order. You don't stop living. You change with it. It is completely inevitable. That doesn't mean force it in that direction either. It means go with the flow. Trust what life gives you, trust your instincts, and don't confuse them with your defenses (either of your current happiness, or plans for your future self)."

Some work gives great benefits, but once you reach a certain point you start to gain less an less.  It applies to a lot of things in life.  The key is to recognize where the hell are you in that curve.   You are, just like all human beings, ultimately, Free.   You can take choices that improve your life.   The thing about Not giving a fuck, is about caring about what's important and ignoring meaningless shit.   What's important is those things that can greatly affect something if they change a little bit. What's meaningless is those things that barely affect something, if they change a lot.   That ""something"", can be anything you value.  Yourself, other people, a project, the world, mankind, anything.   Apply that to your situation.  Not caring about the future, affects you very little or a lot ?  What do you gain and what do you lose ?  Worst case and best case scenario. How big would be the difference ?   If there's a great change, regardless if it's good or bad kind of change, then caring about the future is important.    The great thing about diminishing returns is that tells you some effort in the right place can help you a lot.  Not giving a fuck about a lot of meaningless shit can give you so much time you can afford to pay some effort to a lot of different purposes.   Good luck !"

I was supposed to be getting paid $10-$12 an hour for a few months now, come to find out I'm still getting paid minimum wage. I bitch at my manager, who is also my friend, because what the fuck you know? That's literally thousands of dollars that I was supposed to have. Anyway, then I go to corporate and they wouldn't help me. I was stressing on how to quit, what to say, all that. Then the other day I was vacuuming and corporate called and terminated my employment, said they were making some changes and no longer needed me so I guess that's just getting laid-off. I almost felt sad, then realized I wanted to quit badly anyway so they just did me a favor. Worked in device repair. Fixed iPhones, Samsungs, iPads, all that shit. You know what I did though, since fuck that company? I put a note on my college's bulletin board with prices I'll fix people's phones at and listed them at half the price of my old job.  I have another job lined up hopefully at this new vape shop starting at $9.41 an hour, and I've been vaping for two years and am experienced with the mechanics and building and all that, so I think that'll be good for me. In the mean time I'm trying to just stay chill and not let my free time get the best of me."

All dicks look kind of weird to us, just as I'm sure there's (at least) a mild ick factor for men vis a vis vulvas. Genitals are pretty grotesque any way you slice it. They ain't pretty and they aren't meant to be- they're meant to procreate. Most women aren't going to say anything about your penis. We're more worried about how we look naked than what's going on in your genital region. If you do happen to stumble upon a lady that gives you grief then consider yourself lucky- you probably don't want to sleep with someone who's got weird hangups about stuff like that. It's not worth it. Go forth and proudly dangle your dongle before womenfolk- the good ones will appreciate what it does rather than how it looks."

I personally call honeybadgerism zenning out cause that's just what it feels like to me personally. But this process of achieving that mindstate near permanently has been difficult, because I had to try and remember to get in touch with myself more while in that state to internalize it all. I just figured a huge portion of my Zen today as a matter of fact, and made sure I became familiar with the feeling.   The challenge with teaching this philosophy is coming from the fact that to honestly pass on the art of NGAF, the student has to internalize the philosophy. It's difficult to internalize something and near impossible to do it quickly, unless the person is traumatized. So I would suggest trying to think up some exercises to get inquirers to try to help bring out the honeybadgerism feeling and get it familiar to them first. Then, have them work on self actualizing and internalizing that.   Just my little .02"

howtonotgiveafuck,33tx3h,Kazcube,44,Sat Apr 25 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, initiating a high five is very easy, but we fear the rejection, which makes it difficult to do. It makes us uncomfortable, therefore is outside of our comfort zone. If you work up the courage to initiate this, you'll realise it's not actually a big deal, which will improve your confidence. You'll also expose yourself to rejection and face your fears. It's a form of exposure therapy, which is a process for reducing fear and anxiety responses through repeated exposure to what you're scared of. It has proven to be extremely successful in treating anxiety.  High fiving a stranger is an interesting experiment and demonstrates the lengths you'll go to avoid things that make you uncomfortable. I spent a long time trying to find the 'right person' to high five and made up excuses, like “That guy has his hands in his pockets. He's on his phone. Little girl. Too fat. Too thin. Too pretty. With a group of people...”  What I learnt from this is that there’s always going to be an excuse not to do something that makes you nervous or uncomfortable. High fiving a stranger is way out of my comfort zone. Getting out of my comfort zone is a gateway to bigger things, and not doing it is like denying myself everything in life which I'm currently restricting myself from due to anxiety."

It doesn't necessarily have to be high fiving a stranger or anything listed in that post. You could identify something else that's outside of your comfort zone and do that instead.  It might be confronting someone when you would usually stay quiet, or talking to an acquaintance instead of avoiding them. It's about breaking the pattern of avoidance.

This is your number 1 priority as a therapist can help you bring yourself back to the present and help you re-center yourself. If your therapist can prescribe medication and you feel like you need them, great have him/her do it.

howtonotgiveafuck,33qsh3,covernduck,4,Mon Apr 27 13:23:08 2015 UTC,"If our thoughts and emotions are not controlled by us, what is controlled by us?   We have control over our thoughts and emotions, just not as much as we believe. And the more stressful the situation you find yourself in, the less control you have of what you think and feel (even less).   What is the difference between us and ""our own minds""?   First of all, our brain is primarily a do-not-get-killed device. It judges everything around you, assessing risks to everything that's going on around you. It does this on its own making sure that we survive. That is not you, you have these thoughts whether you want or not. I'm copying something here which I wrote some time ago:   Your mind is a product of 100,000 years of evolution. During these (early) years people in groups generally survived longer and had more children. So it's been passed on to the next generation, then to the next and so on, while people who just tried to manage it on their own didn't have a good chance of survival and if they did, they didn't have any children so their genes didn't get passed on. That is why we worry about what other people think of us. We don't want to be abandoned and expelled from the group, because it lowers our chance of survival. It's been passed onto us and that doesn't make us weak or defective (for having these thoughts), in fact it's normal. Now in todays world that isn't really useful. Getting cut out from a group won't result in death, you just find new friends or if you really want to you can live your life in loneliness, I guess.    So that's why you get anxious when you give a speech or approach a girl.  What our mind is telling us is just a story, and it is almost never what is really happening right here and now. It is what could happen, what could potentially endanger our life.  That's why mindfulness is so useful. To see a situation for what it really is, and not what your mind is telling you.  I.e. When some people are looking at you in a strange way, your mind is telling you ""oh shit. They must be judging me."" That is not what's happening. What's happening is that people are looking at you. The rest is what your mind is telling you.  With mindfulness you can notice these thoughts as stories of the mind. They may be true, may be not. The important questions is: Is this thought helping you to live the life you truly want?"

If ""me"" and ""my mind"" are 2 different things, please tell me what the ""me"" is? If it doesn't consist of thoughts, feelings and so on, what does it consist of?   our mind is telling us is just a story   What is telling a story to what precisely? In other words, what is being told a story and what is doing the telling? Where does the story itself come from?   To see a situation for what it really is, and not what your mind is telling you.   If a situation is not what your mind is telling you, how can you tell? In other words, how can you observe a situation without the use or influence of mind?  When I have the thought ""people are looking at me"" I do not interpret it as criticism or anything else because I never presume to know what other people are thinking and because even if I did, I wouldn't care very much. I happen to know that in this day and age, human beings are all bewildered beyond reckoning.  No one knows why they want what they want, why they believe what they believe or why they do what they do. They don't even know that these things are well worth knowing.  My mind is not other than my self. If you disagree, please clarify further if you can.    Is this thought helping you to live the life you truly want?

howtonotgiveafuck,33qsh3,thetisdeamon,2,Mon Apr 27 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"If ""me"" and ""my mind"" are 2 different things, please tell me what the ""me"" is? If it doesn't consist of thoughts, feelings and so on, what does it consist of?   Maybe I used the terminology a bit wrong here. It doesn't make much sense to differ between what is you and what is not you. That is a philosophical question of free will and we don't know much about it, yet.  What makes more sense is to differ between two different parts of yourself, like OP has mentioned: The ""thinking self"" which is responsible for all thinking, planning, imagening, judging, comparing and so on. So every thought you have originates from the thinking self. And on the other side there is the ""observing self"" which is responsible for attention, awareness and focus. It can observe everything: sounds, smells, vision, thoughts,... The observing self cannot think, it can only pay attention to your thinking self(thoughts). The thinking self thinks about your experience, while the observing self registers it directly.  We use the word ""mind"" usually only for our thinking self, while there is no word for the observing self in the west.  Thinking and observing are two different processes. Your thinking self produces thoughts all the time and you automatically observe them (only you don't know that you are actually observing), which makes it seem that you are those thoughts, that they are the absolute truth. That is what OP called ""fusion"" and ""becoming a slave of the mind"".   This is what mindfulness-meditation or just mindfulness in general is about. You build up such an amount of attention that you can see that thoughts are just words, a bit of language, nothing more, and that feelings are just bodily sensations constantly changing. And you notice sounds, smells, touch, ... That they are just those things. There is a difference between hearing and thinking about hearing.  Your thinking self is commenting on every little thing all the time on what's going on around you. And this is influencing your perception of the world. This is why when you are depressed, your world seems like absolute hell, and people see no way out of this hell and kill themselves.  This is what I meant when I said you can see the world how it really is and not what your mind is telling you. This is what people talk about when they tell you to ""be present"". They see the world much more through the observing self than through the thinking self, the neurotic ego."

For a lot of gyms, regulars start to know and talk to each other, and who knows, you could eventually find a workout partner to go with.  Play a sport? See if there's a city league you could join temporarily.  Sign up for lessons to learn something new.  Think of habits that require you to be around other people, whether you interact with them or not. The more people I'm around, the more I realize the irrationality of my social anxieties and insecurities. No one will ever judge you as much as you judge yourself."

There's many things out there that I don't give a fuck about.  You're always going to give fucks in your life, yes. You have to. Not giving a fuck about anything at all is a very harmful way to live and it means you have no purpose, no drive in your life.  The art lies in choosing what things you want to give a fuck about.  Once you've done that and once you start giving a fuck (or more fucks) about things you want to give a fuck about, you start giving less fucks about the things you don't want to give a fuck about. Because a man only has so many fucks to give.  So start giving a fuck about the good things and the right things (personal time, friendships, a healthy mind and body, etc.) and you'll stop giving a fuck about the wrong things. To me, that is the true meaning of not giving a fuck: to give good fucks, not bad ones.  Also, I don't think I've ever said the word 'fuck' so many times. Well, maybe that one time I stubbed my toe on the bed."

howtonotgiveafuck,33hcot,jerryFrankson,5,Wed Apr 22 18:50:17 2015 UTC,"""The art lies in choosing what things you want to give a fuck about.""  Lets say you choose not giving a fuck what others think about you. As much as you want that, there is always going to be your mind which is going to create thoughts and emotions which are going to make you uncomfortable around others. It's what our mind does. The mistake is that we identify with those thoughts and emotions and the things is we start feeling bad about why are these emotions coming up when we already chosed about not giving a fuck what others think about us. We try to fight them,  ignore them and that only makes it worse. What we should do is acknowledging that we don't entirely control these thoughts and emotions. We understand that our mind is going to give fucks no matter what. Therefore the secret of truly ngaf is accepting that, and not letting it control your behaviour ( Ngaf that you gaf).   (English is not my native language so I hope I am clear on what I am trying to say.)"
howtonotgiveafuck,33hcot,ivaerak,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:38:42 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. But I still don't really agree.  A good female friend of mine died her hair bright blue a few days ago. I don't think she ever died her hair before. You know what everyone's reaction was? Not ""It looks nice on you."", but ""That's such a typical [friend's name] thing to do, it's awesome."" Because she really is that kind of person. When talking casually she gives out way too much personal information, and when she gets bored of her hair colour, she dies it blue. Because that's what she wants to do and she truly doesn't give a fuck about what others think of her.  There are people like that out there. A lot of people. Personally, I strive for a healthy balance. I do give a few fucks about what people think of me, the things I do, the words I use. But not enough to let it define me. I use it as a tool. Because perception is everything. People motivate their choices and actions on perception, which includes their perception of you. And by being a little bit thoughtful of that, I have the power to choose the message I'm sending them. By knowing that and by giving a few fucks about it, I'm conscious of my behaviour around others, but not self-conscious.  That's the way that works for me. If you don't want to give a fuck about what others think of you at all, that's possible too. It just means you have to give more fucks about the things that you like to do, things that make you different. And most importantly to give a fuck about owning that uniqueness.  A kid I knew at school was just so fucking weird. He used to wear gloves even in the summer and to say things that made you go ""What the fuck, dude?"" all the goddamn time. He also did some pretty gross and messed up shit that I won't divulge here. My point is: he was a really fucking weird kid. And that's what everyone saw when they looked at him. But he didn't give a fuck. He was doing stuff he wanted to be doing, however messed up it was. I'm not saying you should become like that guy, you really shouldn't. But I'm pretty sure he was happy.  So I stand by what I said earlier. To me, the key is to find stuff you want to be giving a fuck about. That's what works for me and that's what I'm sticking to. If what you're saying is working for you, then we have no problem."
howtonotgiveafuck,33hcot,Spacemage,2,Thu Apr 23 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"I gurantee you that the weird kid, your friend and anyone whose actions scream a not giving a fuck attitude in one points have had doubts, negative thoughts and uncomfortable emotions etc. when doing an action which says to the world idgaf. The difference between them and the ones struggling to achieve that attitude is that, they consciously or unconsciously accept these emotions, thoughts etc. and if needed they act contrary to what these emotions makes them to act. They detach from them and therefore they do want they truly want to do.They acknowledge that their mind might give a fuck but decide to not give a fuck about that at all because they know that they can't controll their mind emotions etc as much as they would like."

A dude that I'm kinda friends with gets bikes for free because of his sponsorship - he recently was given a bike worth around $3,000 for free cuz he's awesome.  He also owns a bike courier company and kinda drunkenly offered me a job there, even though they're pretty much fully staffed.   I trust somethings gonna happen, I just gotta focus more on what I love to do rather than what I've never done (but would like to do). There should be a distinction between just wanting to be a cool/awesome person because that's actually what you want to do with your life, rather than that's how you want to be perceived by others.

I've realized had wierd social issues, have issues connecting with people, up until a few years ago I didnt like to be touched it was weird to me but now I realize its normal. Social anxiety and feeling weird acting around other people. I always had girlfriends in school, but that was it. I realized- I friendzoned every girl I talked to. This is so fucking weird I feel so bad about this. This is where I really think I had more problems than I realized. I've had girls touch me, but I brushed them off cause I never made the intimate connection. I flirted with them and didnt realize. Pretty much couple girls straight up said they'd do me, they like me. I didnt realize they liked me when they talking to me and a girl tried to grab into my pants and I brushed her off. How fucking weird is that!  Anxiety didnt help I graduated a virgin cause I didnt make the connections, I was just a kid. I think I'm a late bloomer I have a baby face up until last year. I dropped out of community college from the anxiety, I realized I didnt have the confidence to go back to school and dropped out after 2 weeks.

It seems to me that developing all these techniques and actively using them every single day is draining one's own energy and life, when on the other hand, the abuser uses minimum energy to drop insults, which drain the victim's time and energy."
howtonotgiveafuck,3338sn,Harbor_City,2,Sun Apr 19 10:07:30 2015 UTC,"I agree to a certain extent. It depends on the type of person you are dealing with. When it comes to attention seekers (sometimes) you can't simply ignore them. You have to know the type of personality they have, because if you ignore their insults, it may be received as a sign of weakness and cause them to continue their abuse.   In my case, I don't see ignoring him as a bad thing because it takes minimal effort and I am avoiding a negative encounter. I could try other things, like talking to my boss about it or standing up to the abuse, but that takes more energy and planning, and quite frankly, I just don't give a damn. :)"

False entitlement complex, insecure, makes fun of others for the sake of receiving a reaction (which will lead to even more offensive jokes), attention-seeker, throws tantrums like a child when things don't go his way, makes loud noise just to annoy others...  I can't talk about him with getting annoyed at least a little. He used to pick on me, stopped, and now he's doing it again. What I've been doing is exactly the same thing you're doing now. I mastered the technique of pulling off an unamused face, looking at him dead in the eye and sighing as I ignore his really bad jokes. They're not even jokes, they're straight up insults.  The thing is, I don't think this is a situation where you should ignore. I've been doing it and these kind of people don't stop. They might for a while, but it doesn't last long, it's a game to them. They enjoy offending others. It's a hobby. You can either laugh with them or laugh back at them, either get thrown shit at or catch it and throw it back. Obviously though, it depends on what kind of asshole you're dealing with. If they're at least a bit of a responsible adult, they'll get the message, however if they're a child throwing tantrums like this dude they for sure won't.   Take a few jokes to show you're not a stuck up, and then tell him to fuck off when he goes too far. Ignore a few if you want to, but don't just stand there every time and let him piss on you. Depends on the severity as I said, though you still shouldn't let anyone abuse you every day. If work becomes very unenjoyable just because of one person, it's time you shut those kind of people up."
howtonotgiveafuck,3338sn,JohnFell,3,Sun Apr 19 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with Seroton1n in that you absolutely CANNOT win with a narcissist, except if you are able to escape them.  In the workplace, this is extremely difficult to do.  Corporate America embraces the narcissist.  Since the narcissist is not constrained by morals or truth the way everyone else is, the deck is stacked in their favor.  They often win raises, promotions, and the admiration and favors of higher-ups because they lie about themselves and others, and if they have even marginal impulse control they ensure that people in power never see any unsavory parts of their behavior or personality.  Life is indeed one big game to them.  Narcissism often overlaps with some degree of sociopathy, and when human attachments and affections (giving and receiving) are not a motivation, life gets pretty boring for the narcissist so the only thing they have left is toying with others the way a barn cat toys with a mouse.  If you do figure out a way to beat them at their own game, at least temporarily, then you've won the battle but started a war.  They will simply escalate their behavior to win the game.  They might retreat for a while to lick their wounds but they will return to their game.  It really sucks.    The one I'm dealing with now, some things have worked temporarily.  He's insanely passive-aggressive and I've confronted him recently on his passive-aggressive belittling of me and told him ""You talking to me this way stops.  NOW.""  His reaction was sheer bewilderment and 100 percent denial that he ever uttered the frequently-uttered insults.  But he backed off to my face, probably due to being shocked someone actually stood up to him.  Instead, he is now working directly with my boss to try and sabotage me and it's working.  I've had multiple conversations with my boss about this person, and so has the previous manager who retired, but boss thinks all problems amongst coworkers are 100 percent the fault of the person who brings the problem to her, and it's up to the worker to cure the psycho coworker of all of their pathologies as if by magic.  So I'm looking for another job."

It's really too bad you feel the need to find a new job.  Other than direct confrontation, one thing I've found that does work, and this is really tough and long term, is to get going and outwork, outperform, and outclass him.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  And the tough ones make the going all the tougher.  This cause's now lit the fire.  Time now for you to move the Earth.  Use what has happened to motivate you to succeed at your job.  He'll never catch back up to you.  You don't cure psychos.  They lack psychological wiring necessary to be cured.  Rise above and go at your job with zeal, and powerful professionalism.  Help others succeed, Collaborate.  Be a leader.  Its not this guy you need to convince.  It's your co-workers, your management, your leaders.  How can you make their day more easy?  How can you help them look good and help them reach their goals?  The psycho is like an old wasp.  The pain in the ass, no fun to work with, but you don't owe this creep the sweat of your b__ls. He's not in your league.  You just became your boss's best, most valuable employee, thank you very much psycho.  Now get back up on the porch and stop backing if you can't run with the big dogs, psycho.  Empower yourself.  Monday's just a few hours away.  Go forth and drive your life with deadly seriousness and motivated goal orientation.  You now are the lion in the room.   It's a mindset.  Hope this helps.

I tried to calm him down but he punched me and pushed me on the table. I somehow managed to keep my cool (I was really close to snapping and beating him to the pulp) and called the police, he ran away before they came.   Unfortunately I have to see this guy every now and then due to my hobbies so I can't avoid him. I've tried to ignore him completely but it's hard. I've had to tell people ""I'm not sitting next to that lunatic"" and moved to an other seat or make him move, so he knows I kind of recognize his existence. I know if he even once pushes or agitates me, I'm going to snap and pummel his face in. I've told him to not push my buttons and the fact I'm afraid I might get violent if he even once touches me.

People can be completely different under the influence of liquid rage (I'm speaking from my own personal experience). I'm no psychologist, but perhaps he has some type of mental disorder.  Nobody deserves to be assaulted and I don't want to excuse his behavior either.  As hard as this may be for you, maybe you could ask if he has any hard feelings against you, and if so, then why. If he brings up the whole party thing that happened, tell him it's not a big deal. Then ask what you can do to resolve those feelings. Just a suggestion. Otherwise, if he's just a dick about it, then play it cool and walk away."

howtonotgiveafuck,32vl3u,ClearEyeColoredMind,92,Fri Apr 17 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"Life shouldn't be about accepting death and having to deal with it.   When you accept death, you no longer have to deal with it. By accepting death, you stop giving a fuck about it. That's the whole point, imo. Also, it seems to me as if you are confusing acceptance with surrender. Accepting eliminates the burden of it altogether.  Of course you can avoid the entire affair by simply being present. If you confine yourself to the present, death simply ceases to exist. That is, until the moment it happens to you of course, but then at least you will have lived a full and care-free life and it won't seem so bad anymore :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,32vl3u,fight_collector,12,Fri Apr 17 03:38:04 2015 UTC,I agree. I think truly accepting death is the most liberating feeling you can ever achieve. It allows you to experiment and have fun with whatever you want while your here knowing that the warm blanket of nothingness will eventually put you to eternal rest. To some that may seem terrifying but to me it's actually comforting. If you try to ignore death and pretend that it's not gunna happen it's likely that at some point that suppression is going to manifest as anxiety.

I don't know what to believe, hell, maybe I don't believe anything. All of this really sparked from me losing my dad two years ago, and maybe I haven't accepted death.

That's how I've stopped fearing death. Accepting death has made me realize that its okay to die, its a natural part of life. Death is enviable so enjoy life while you can and make the best of it. Your time on earth is precious that's why you shouldn't give a fuck and do what makes you happy. What happens afterwards is unknown. Maybe there's a heaven, maybe we get reincarnated, maybe we return the reptilian overload or maybe nothing happens afterwards. Who the fuck knows. All you know for certain is that just like every living thing on this planet your time will come and you will pass.

Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality without Religion is Sam Harris' new book and I think it's by far his best. It takes a very scientific approach to the same stuff Alan Watts was talking about 50 years ago in The Book: On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are which is also a must-read for those of us who frequently contemplate death. Another earlier Watts book is also very worth-while: The Wisdom of Insecurity. All of them generally revolve around the illusion of the ego and the kind of existential crisis that it can cause. Google them if you're interested. They've helped me as much as anything has.

We know what happens to your meat-vehicle--it gets recycled back into the universe--but as to what happens to your awareness, we're all grasping at straws. Maybe if we could even explain the process of consciousness, or detect it, or measure it, we might be able to speculate, but we can't. All we know is there is a relationship between the physical brain and the experience of being but correlation does not necessarily equal causation.

It holds the water admirably. When the sun shines on it, it reflects the light beautifully. When I tap it, it has a lovely ring. Yet for me, this glass is already broken. When the wind knocks it over or my elbow knocks it off the shelf and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‘Of course.’ But when I understand that this glass is already broken, every minute with it is precious.”   The rollercoaster ride WILL end. This is inevitable. The sooner you can internalize that life is fleeting and you only have moments to enjoy it, the more you will get out of it. Not accepting the fact that it all eventually ends leads only to anxiety and grief.

In any case, I think the acceptance of death can lead to apathy towards life, which albeit i digress is the nature of this sub! Nonetheless I agree with op. On the rollercoaster your enjoying it, but a factor that contributes to its appeal is that at any moment you could fly off, or the rollercoaster could go off its rails. The fear of death contributes i think to the vitality of life in a way. The fear of death gives you an opportunity to live life with courage. That is not to say that one should live under a rock for the rest of his life, on the contrary, the rush that comes out of life is to take risks, be adventurous, and do things one would not normally do. Without the fear of death or suffering all this would be meaningless and a sedentary life would be just as appealing. Just my two cents.

howtonotgiveafuck,32uk8z,WickWackLilJack,6,Fri Apr 17 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"I think being present is about just going with the flow, not get caught in your head and being defused with your emotion while accepting that you can't completely control and being okay with that   You're certainly flirting with presence! I think you're describing amor fati more than presence, but the two are very much related. Amor fati is love of fate, or wholesale acceptance of the present moment as it is, as if you had chosen it for yourself. Because hey, this is the way things are right now: you can accept it or deny it but it won't change a bit. If it's a shitty situation and you can change it, do so: if not, accept, adapt, and move forward.  Presence is a state of no mind. Have you ever been engrossed or absorbed with a task? And then you look up and realize your whole day has gone, only it felt like you were doing XYZ for a few minutes only? That's presence.   You know when you rehash some negative experience in your past for no reason? Or look forward to your upcoming vacation in two weeks? Or look at the clock every five minutes wishing the day would be over? That's time traveling, aka the opposite of presence.   Hope that helps :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,32uk8z,fight_collector,3,Fri Apr 17 00:00:52 2015 UTC,To me that phrase means focusing on what you are doing at a specific point. I'll agree with your take of not getting caught up and getting emotional about things.

howtonotgiveafuck,32uk8z,mana_Teehee,2,Fri Apr 17 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"Being present is along the same lines as cultivating mindfulness.  Focusing your awareness in this moment, and letting go of thoughts of the future or the past, or even your judgements or filters of your current experience.  Looking at it from a purely practical standpoint, at any given moment you only have so much mental, emotional, physical, and material resources you can bring to bear in any given situation.  That is the sum total of your sentient force, your ability to effect change.  The only place that you can effect change is in this present moment.  If you are busy worrying about or looking forward to the future, or regretting or reminiscing about the past, your sentient force is scattered.  You're temporally unfocused.  It's the difference between a lightbulb and a laser.  Being present is coherence, focusing all of your attention here and now so that you can see things for what they are and act appropriately in the moment."

It's advised to keep yourself involved to take your mind off things, e.g. take up tennis. It's a hard sport if you're a beginner. All your physical and mental energy will be expedited into getting the ball to cross the net and land within the lines on the opposite side. and later you thinki about how you played, give yourself more things to think about. Push the rubbish to the back of the mind, and eventually drive it out.  I started volunteering with a cat shelter.

I'm either feeling trepidation/anxiety/fear of doing an action because my past has taught me to be that way, or I'm dreaming about an ""ideal"" (read: bullshit!) future that does not exist (as the future, unarguably, doesn't exist).  You may not be exactly where you want to be, but it is where you are!  So interact with who's there, get everything good than can be gotten out of where you are, even if you think you'd rather be somewhere/somewhen else.  Use whatever ability you do have (which I know all to well can feel like none at all sometimes) to make better your situation.  ""Being present"" is sort of a different way of saying ""make the best of the situation.""  Also, read this: I saved it off a website called Cedonulli  This guy is prone to stream-of-consciousness prose, but his stream is a damn smart one.  That's an understatement - he's a consummate fucking genius, and he just writes the way he writes.  Anyhow, he's shut down and reopened his website more than once, so I saved this thinking it may happen again:  Here’s something that annoys the fuck out of me, on all levels.  Questions.  Questions intended to build a profile.  Like … “so what do you do for a living?”, from some middle aged couple’s wife I just met fourteen seconds ago.  These kinds of questions are designed to profile you.  NOT to get to know you, but rather the opposite.  Put you in a pre-defined category.  Based on your clothes, your hair, your job.  That requires no personal effort to understand you as a person, and it’s in all likelihood also building a completely incorrect perspective about you.  It’s lame, it’s shallow, and it’s annoying.  People disagree with me a lot on this one.  They say that it’s just a starting point, somewhere to build common ground, society approved way of commencing a dialog.  It’s NOT, though.  It’s just drive-through mentality of understanding your surroundings, and I’m refusing to participate.  Similarly, girls trying to get to “know” you by asking a million questions.  The answers, no matter what, are creating an illusion.  If you dated a lot, then she compares you to some other dude she dated who also did.  Makes a million assumptions based on that guy.  And sure, I’m going to an extreme vilifying any and all questions.  My problem with them is if they’re used as a shortcut and therefore denying the person a genuine experience building their own understanding.  It’s like the difference between being able to see or being blind.  If I blindfold you, you’ll notice things you never did before.  Sounds.  Smells.  Touch.  You’ll have to pay attention with a multitude of senses to replace the one you rely most on.  Just like questions.  I’m always told that I’m very evasive, vague, mysterious.  I’m going to force you to know me based on this current moment.  Your own, personal, direct observation of right now, what you yourself see, perceive, feel, understand.  Because that’s what I really am, not a collection of my work experience, travel, or dating history.  The point of this post?  Try to experience people you find interesting in a new way.  Don’t gather factual bits about their past, in order of importance the way you perceive it (maybe that person really doesn’t care about a career, but you do … so asking them gives you a totally irrelevant perspective about them).  Look at how they stand, gesture, smile, how they present themselves, what they will talk about when you volunteer conscious attention, open, no agenda, no directed inquisitions.  Tell stories, see what kind of interaction that creates.  Be in the current moment with a person, rather than fact tidbits of their past."

Fortunately, I came finally to the conclusion that I shouldn't do it just because I want to fit in, but it took me some time.  EDIT: I should add, that I am much happier to be truth to myself. When I meet up with friends and go out, I can have fun without drinking, the downside is only that real drunk people are incredibly annoying when you are sober..."

I stopped years ago—I'll have one drink, to be polite, and TBH some craft beers are very tasty—but never go further. Three drinks and I spend the whole next day in a weird depressive state. Never worth it. I make every effort to be chill and non-judgmental about it, though sometimes this is hard in the face of the tremendous onslaught of pro-drinking culture.  The hard to not GAF about part of it is that being able to drink, or at least tolerate drunk people (sorry, just can't) would enable me to get a lot further in life. I'm a respected player in a local arts scene, but I'll never crack the inner circle, because the inner circle hangs out and drinks together. But, like I said, just not worth it.  You will find this gets much, much easier as time passes. By 30 or so, the real drinkers will mostly self-segregate.

Evidences of NIHL include a history of exposure to loud sound and a hearing loss in a narrow range of frequencies, such as those from gunfire, power tools, explosions and night club music. The loud sounds result in the over-stimulation of the hearing cells leading to cell death. The two types of loss are one, intense noise incident, or gradually, over time due to exposure to noise. There are certain fields in which workplaces have hazardous levels of noise. Musicians have a very acoustic ""workplace,"" and can develop gradual NIHL through the music they constantly hear. Governmental agencies describe workplace standards to manage noise pollution and protect the hearing of workers. The best, first option for protecting hearing is lowering the volume at the source of the sound.  There are, however, ways to mitigate the damage after a period of potentially damaging noise. There are also options to manage hearing loss once it has occurred.

Think about something else, like a leaf falling out of the sky, or your ingrown toenail, or the tack of peanut butter and jelly in the crevice of your top right molar. There are a bajillion other things going on at all times that are of equal opportunity for you to focus on.  You're right, you have had an obsession. Don't worry so much about why it came to be. You're been brought up to pine after girls. That's the Disney fantasy -- the girl is rescued by the prince charming who's been plotting for years how best to win her love.   Fantasy being the operative word.   Your heart hasn't been physically ripped out. You aren't an idiot. You had an ideal in your head about how the world works that didn't quite match up with reality, and when she bailed, you couldn't give up on that ideal.  You kept tabs on her. You extracted excruciating details about her sex life after the fact and harbored over them. You spent a lot of energy hoping and dreaming, like the Disney fantasy wants you to do. You kept hurting yourself, over and over, until you began to convince yourself that the pain was worth it.  Now, you're facing reality. You've habitually focused on the thought of her each time it comes up, and now it's a really strong thing when it does come up.  Stop it.  Like any addictive pattern, it can be broken. Each time you think about her, consciously be aware of the thought, but let your focus travel elsewhere. Let that thought of her die out. It's not her you're focusing on, not how she is today. It's of how she was yesterday. It's not helpful. It's a choice. A choice you can make today. Each day, it will get 1% easier. Soon enough, you'll move on. You'll find another girl to shag.   Or not.   You can keep pining. It's your choice. You can keep blaming some girl in the past for why you're not being social and happy today. When your friend says, ""dude, I've got two chicks over, I need you to come over and handle one so I can get some,"" you can say, ""sorry man, this girl I knew ten years ago really fucked me up and I can't be a man anymore."" That loses you bro-points. You don't want to lose bro-points.  If you want a feel-good movie about this, watch Swingers with Jon Favreau and Vince Vahn.  If you want to take real action, take a class in Mindfulness Meditation or see a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist. It's cheaper than you think.  Good luck!"

howtonotgiveafuck,31zlhx,Spasmoganabulator,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:50:57 2015 UTC,Heartaches all about wanting what you can't have or waxing nostalgic about something you once had. Both of which are next to impossible to focus on if you truly look forward to your own life. Look at what you already have and how far your own faculties can take you. A lost love doesn't compare to a lost life and ambition. If you're looking to get over the heartache start living like you are. Open yourself up to new experiences and stop idealizing something so out of context that it's become pure fantasy.

howtonotgiveafuck,31qgrl,jimmahdean,7,Tue Apr 7 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"""Bringing myself down""  Therein lies the thing. You are being harsh upon yourself my friend. Let me ask you, would you ever treat a close friend the same way you treat yourself and bring yourself down?   I believe it may be wise to begin with how you perceive yourself. Start by truly forgiving yourself for any of your past wrongdoing or mistakes. This allows you to be at peace with yourself. Then work on bettering yourself the way you want to better yourself, not the way someone else wants you to be.  Then perhaps you should treat yourself as you would a dear friend. Encourage yourself when you fail, and seek to comfort yourself when you are down (do something you enjoy, seek out friends, etc.).   I lived a miserable existence when I cared too much about the way people thought (or rather, how I thought they thought, another line from Othello). I decided one day, that I had enslaved myself to the opinions of others and abused myself for too long, that from now on, I am my priority. I will find friends who like who I truly am, even if it takes a while to find them. I will live life according to my values, not acquiesce to what others believe. By living a good life under my values and under my direction I can take pride in who I am, even if others disagree.  I hope this helps."
howtonotgiveafuck,31qgrl,jimmahdean,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:01:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty good at being myself, though I usually feel bad if someone doesn't like me. ""I'm likable, damn it! Why don't you like me?"" This generally doesn't happen. It's happened a couple of times because when I'm in a good mood, I can be obnoxious as fuck. It's usually because, when working customer service, I simply can't help people through no fault of my own. I like helping people, but I can't schedule some bitch for 6pm when she's an hour and a half away from the shop and we close at 4, I'm sorry, it's not gonna happen. Just because the products we sell are a thousand plus does not you're some special snowflake.  I value honesty and humility, and someone's not honest with me, ""Oh, sorry, I have family stuff to do."" Sits at home doing nothing Then I get really frustrated, I know it's for a good cause, but just tell me you don't want to come, I can handle it. Don't act like you know everything about everything when I just told you a story about some plane crash in some show I'm watching and now all of a sudden you're an expert on plane crashes. You can admit you don't know fuck all and you're intrigued. Of course, I'm too reserved to tell people off when I need to, though it would certainly get them off my back, I don't want to upset them.  Wow, that was rambly, okay, whatever, I'm done for now. :P  EDIT: Not done. I think my biggest thing preventing me from not giving a fuck is that I live with someone who's a complete douche and it's driving me crazy. He stays up all night playing video games, and I told him that when I get out of the shower, I don't want to have to wait for him to get off of my computer in the morning because I don't have very long to relax before work. The next day, I come out of the shower and he's fucking playing frontier defense in titanfall. I tried the whole not giving a fuck thing. ""Dude, what the fuck? I told you I don't want to have to wait."" (Not tactful, it was 5:30am) ""I'll be done in a minute, man, you don't need to be a little fuck about it."" ... I know I shouldn't care, but if he's just going to bitch, and it's not going to solve anything, I'd rather not get insulted. If I could actually manage to get someone to do what I wanted when I stopped giving a fuck and got mad, then I could probably learn to do it."
howtonotgiveafuck,31qgrl,thejaytheory,4,Tue Apr 7 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"If I may, I see how you are approaching many of these scenarios, and I believe a different approach may be in order.   I have felt that same feeling of sadness when someone doesn't like you when you are yourself. It permeated a lot of my mindset last year. Here's something to consider however. If you are being the person you truly are, laughing at the jokes you find funny, and enjoying the things you like enjoying, if the other person thinks that your jokes are bad, or your definition of fun or hobby is a waste of time, why the hell do you want to spend another minute with that individual? I think British humor is hysterical, and I know a great many people who don't like it one bit, and they are what might be considered popular or generally fun people. But I don't want to hang out with them, or be considered 'part of their group' if they don't like what I like! Instead I kept looking til I found people who like the things I like, and I bond over that stuff. I know I am likable and still there are some people who treat me like dogshit, for no reason other than from their perspective, they don't like the way I act. I don't care. That's them, they can think  what they want, I elect not to hang out with them. What I am getting at, is if someone doesn't like the real you, they are not worth your time, you wouldn't like them anyway.   I also feel for you on the honesty and humility part. I got downright indignant with a group of people who went behind my back and gossiped about me, then had the audacity to smile and greet me warmly. In that instance, the best thing to do is to cut ties with someone if they are toxic enough to deceive you. In the example you gave, it seems like they were trying to avoid hurting your feelings or seeming like a sluggabed by not doing something for a good cause. Either way, that is their issue that they can't be honest with themselves. That's their character flaw, it doesn't reflect on you nor should it concern you unless you are their boss. I know friends who have horrific time management, but as much as it vexes me, I know it isn't anything against me, it's just how they are. You do you, I'ma do me.   Last thing, and probably, the most important.  ""If I could actually manage to get someone to do what I wanted when I stopped giving a fuck and got mad, then I could probably learn to do it.""   That is not IDGAF, that's still giving too much of a damn. In fact, you give so many damns, you are trying to be the primary investor in the Damn Corporation, so you can control what direction the company heads in. You cannot make people change, you cannot force them to do anything, just like no one can force you to do anything. The point of IDGAF is to not let petty nonsense like your degenerate roommate bug you to the point where you can't operate normally. I had a degenerate as a roommate too, and I couldn't get him to move. IDGAF solution was to simply not let his degenerate ways bug me, and simply carry on with my day. Now of course, I don't know the specifics of that one, if he is being loud at 2AM in the morning you have every right to blast Dave Mustaine at him until he gets the picture.  That's my two cents."

No, what's fucking bullshit is you yelling at a goddamn video game when I'm sleep 10 feet behind you and I have to be up in 2 hours.  I do give way too many damns. That's why I'm here.

Take some steps to see if landlord/residence authority can do anything about it. If he is not respecting the general unsaid rule of ""Don't scream after 12am you pig slop eating degenerate"" than you can absolutely take measures to get him to respect it. I will warn you however, authorities like a landlord or a resident authority may not be able to do anything.  Of course, like I said, if he is yelling at 3am in the morning, I consider that free reign to make his life a living hell by blasting an airhorn in his ear every time he yells.

Break down all of that in to pieces.. actually just like you did with your list.   -Work is very stressful. Many projects in the works and lots of responsibility headed my way.   Do you have these under control? Are they timed right or workload dispersed to you can manage? Yes? Golden.. No? Then make a plan so they are.   -I'm divorced and one of my kids doesn't seem to like me all that much. He's young and is always saying how he wants to go to his mom's house, but still...it stings to hear him say that stuff. He also routinely calls me by his mom's BF's name.   I am divorced too but my kids are older. If you can, talk to him about. It might be a developmental stage (younger boys want mommy more). As far as calling you the wrong name..might be a good indicator that your stress is causing you to not spend QUALITY time.. don't know.   -I have a disease that causes me great fatigue and pain. Have had it for almost 20 years and it is really starting to get to me how bad I feel. There isn't much hope in a cure either although I've been in treatment for the past 2 years but am still hurting.   Is it the actual pain that is getting to you more now, or the fact that you have this disease? If it's the later, some relaxation moments and focusing on accepting who you are related to this may help. Also, is it made worse when you are stressed?   -I fucking come home last night and a fucking tree fell over and crushed three of my neighbors' fence. I have no idea how much this is going to cost me but I don't think it will be cheap.   Go talk to your neighbor. If you two can handle it like adults it may not be as bad as you are thinking. If it is as bad, make a plan.   -I don't have much family...just my mom and a brother whom I sometimes talk to. Depressing.   First, lots of people would love to have a mother and brother...you're up on people who are literally all alone. Second, and you know this already, go make some friends.   -I have ADD/ADHD which I'm sure isn't helping matters much.   Don't let that be an excuse. If you aren't treating that, you should.  Bottom line is, things become overwhelming when we can't see a clear plan for managing them all. Break the overwhelming picture in to small snap shots, plan what you can and manage the rest. This too shall pass.  EDIT: Being a psychologist doesn't mean I know everything, just not pulling random stuff out my butt."

When people around me demean me by allowing their lifestyle decisions to destroy our friendship or relationship because they choose to stay negative, around other negative people, or even just out of shape, mind and body, I often wonder if I've made the right decision by moving 1200 miles away without a word said to friends I've had for years, people who I loved more than anything.  Those people never really stuck to any of the truths that friendships are built upon. Some decided that, in my struggles, they were neutral parties. I could never argue with neutrality.  However, others outright lied to me, hurt me directly so that they could gain from it. That is too much, and fucks or not, I mo longer felt supported by anyone I was close with. So I left withot a word. I don't talk to them anymore and I don't know that I ever will.  I guess I just want something new in life, not the same old, immature mind sets. I strive for fulfillment, usually they would just be chasing fleeting happiness, the next party, the next high.... I wanted a solid future, where I would be able to have a great time all of the time, have nice things, be able to meet interesting people and study interesting art. Have access to ever more forms of pleasures, and even to let them slip away, to recognize that hey are merely moments of eternity, priceless and innumerable as the stars in the sky.    I would not like to become overindulgent. My ideal lifestyle would be a sort of electronic music monk hood, however, I am young, there is fire in my heart and lungs, and I want to show the world the Eerie Light that burns in me.  My old friends, they wanted to get high, and so I had to leave hem all behind.   Cause I wanna get higher than them.  Than anyone. Hahaha. Motivated but few fucks given."

If someone believes you are bad, then that is fine. They are entitled to their opinions.  The point is that you know that you are doing a good job by your own standards; and that's what matters.  tldr Care about doing your job well, not what other people think of you."

Whiny students are a good example of stress factors, so if I were you, I'd ignore them. Usually, they are just looking for confirmation why you graded them the way you did, so it's also a very good idea if you can explain to them what they did wrong. You can always just hear them out, and if their complaints make sense, then correct their grades, without giving too much of a fuck about it.  The opposite of this is happiness. Whatever makes you happy is worth giving lots (if not all) of (your) fucks about."

So you don't give a fuck that it's hard. You care where it counts and that's important. But try not to let those kinds of comments eat into you like that. Reaffirm to yourself that you are doing absolutely everything you can to be a badass teacher and don't let anyone tell you differently. If it eats into you like that it's likely because on some level you're concerned they're right. Take that uncertainty out of the equation by any means.

That's something great about you and that you should preserve and cherish.  The point where you cross the line is when you identify too much of yourself, and every eventual setback will make you doubt about your own being and purpose. This is what you should learn to control.  On the more practical side, try also to recognise how much you're trying your best with the resource and constraints that you are given, especially working with students that can be assholes despite them (we've all been there), and repeat to yourself that you're done your best and there's few chances that someone would have done a better job.

You just have to make a line to figure out what is your responsibility and what isn't your responsibility. It is your responsibility to teach the material. It is your responsibility to put fair questions on a test, and to provide assistance to any student that asks for it. It is not your responsibility to give everyone an A. It's each student's responsibility to take the information you've given them, understand it, and apply it to the tests. Its their responsibility to seek help if they don't understand it.  As an educator, you should try to inspire students to learn. You can't force them to learn what you're teaching if they don't want to learn it. Not everyone will get A's because not everyone will want to learn what you're teaching."

In your case, if you feel like you work hard, you do everything you can, and you still have students complaining then it's probably on them and not you. They're probably just slackers looking for an easy grade. Therefore, they do not deserve any to be given any fucks.  I'm not saying everyone is perfect all the time. It's always good to assess what you're doing and how you're doing it, but if you're giving everything you can, then it's probably a good bet you're already giving all the fucks required."

Just last week I worked up the courage to join a small pick up game at my local park. I just moved across country, and have been craving some soccer lately.  I saw seven guys playing down the street at the park and I went home, got my stuff, and almost put everything away because I didn't have the balls to go ask.  After a couple minutes of mental debating, I realized I had nothing to lose. I went down the block, walked onto the field, and asked if they minded I join them.  They all ended up being on the city Highschool team, making them a little younger than me (im 22).  But it was really fun and they ended up asking a few questions and I gave them a few pointers.  This thread got me really excited, with me being a pretty shy person. I feel like I broke through a tough barrier that I've always had problems with."

If you get the transplant, will the other organs recover or are they permanently compromised?"
howtonotgiveafuck,31cria,trauma_gland,6,Sat Apr 4 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"My spleen will always be enlarged but the pressure differential between it and my liver will be eliminated.  Over time it may shrink somewhat.  I will be at less risk of rupturing it (which I have done before) because of the reduced pressure between those two organs.  It is my opinion that the ascites are also pressurizing my spleen. The fluid adds pressure to everything in my abodminal cavity and maybe even the thoracic cavity when I am very full of fluid. They should clear up with the new liver.    I have osteoporosis from taking steroids to reduce liver inflammation for 8 years.  The osteoporosis should also be improved over a period of time.    My blood will be much more normal.    One big concern is that several of the drugs I take and cirrhosis itself lower blood pressure in the heart.  The new liver will put my BP back to normal and there is a possibility of having a heart attack, stroke, or other heart problem.  Hopefully any other damage as a result of my liver having a reduced ability to process toxins will recover as well.  I am probably approaching kidney damage at this point so hopefully the transplant comes pretty soon!"

Not only did it lead me to depression, it lead me to mild schizophrenia, 7 years of 2 degrees, a fear of everything even leaving my room and near suicide twice (was ontop of the bridge i was about to jump from.

There is only one persons approval who you need and thats yours. When you go to bed the only person that will be thinking about you is you.

howtonotgiveafuck,316n0g,misskinky,21,Thu Apr 2 12:23:48 2015 UTC,The fact that you're worried about not giving a fuck means you still have the capacity to care or you wouldn't even be asking this question.
howtonotgiveafuck,316n0g,IllPanYourMeltIn,3,Thu Apr 2 13:36:29 2015 UTC,"Ok yes, you're right, clearly I do have some small capacity to care. But if it weren't an issue, I wouldn't have felt the need to ask the question."
howtonotgiveafuck,316n0g,IllPanYourMeltIn,3,Thu Apr 2 14:53:45 2015 UTC,The point I'm making is that if you do have the capacity to care then you need to try to hold on to that feeling of caring about things and channel it into the important stuff.
howtonotgiveafuck,316n0g,Crag_Hack_HOMM,9,Thu Apr 2 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Very general phrasing but from what I gather, you have moved from being indifferent about minor things into becoming apathetic about everything.   Forgive me, but I find it hard to believe you are fully immersed in the IDGAF mentality. You already show you care to some extent, so you might be thinking you are in this mindset.  When I immersed myself into this philosophy, I made a choice: I no longer give a shit about what people think about me, BUT I give a damn about MY values. I don't give a fuck about meeting other people's expectations, BUT I do give a fuck about meeting MY expectations and fulfilling MY wants and goals. Fuck you if you think success is being a CEO. I think success is leaving a mark on the world, so I am going to do that.  Try this; go write down your goals and values (if you haven't fully figured them out yet, that's fine, it takes a while). Read this list and ingrain it in your head. Work everyday to meet these goals in some way. For example, I want to write a book, so everyday, I set aside at least an hour to write, damn the torpedoes if someone wants me to do something for them during that time.   This mentality isn't about being apathetic, its about getting rid of the anxieties about small shit that holds you back, so you can get on with developing the self written epic that is your life.   tl;dr: Find a passion and give a fuck about that passion."

I think your next step should be this:  Forgive yourself for NGAF.  You have learned not to care about the judgments of others, now it is time to learn that you are Not Required to Judge yourself."
howtonotgiveafuck,315k0f,Altec1234,9,Thu Apr 2 03:55:47 2015 UTC,"Most people have an innate thing for wanting to help others which ends up destroying themselves in the process as it neglects their own mental/physical health; I think this is because it's a lot easier to help other people than deal with our own problems and helping others allows us to shunt our own to the wayside. Unfortunately, it is worse in the long run to do this, as it makes us worse, and ultimately if people don't want to be helped, they can't be (which I honestly think is the case for most people, especially addicts).   We suffer through other people's suffering because it can sometimes give us solace for our own suffering, especially if we haven't learnt to disconnect from them and that we can't help, that we shouldn't try to help.   Giving less fucks about the things we can't change leaves more room to focus on the self. I know that's looked down upon, but it shouldn't be. If people focused more on the self - which yeah, does involve being more apathetic and less empathetic to others (but not actively destructive, mind) - I think things would likely be better overall. We often give too many fucks about things we can't change which ends up making our own lives worse as we dwell in misery."

howtonotgiveafuck,315k0f,xenokilla,3,Thu Apr 2 11:38:58 2015 UTC,I recommend reading Codependent No More by Melody Beattie or a similar book dealing with the topic.

howtonotgiveafuck,315k0f,pejoration,2,Thu Apr 2 09:17:52 2015 UTC,"So many people on this Earth are suffering. Far too many. The natural order is for us to try and help one another. It's called love. Some people are way too stuck in their own misery that not only do they use addictions to keep the feelings at bay, but they suck other people in by seeking validation for the way they live their lives.   As long as you're around them, their energy is going to affect you no matter what. Whenever you see yourself striding from the truth, try to return to your breath for a while. Long and deep and hold it for a while, and then the opposite. Feel your own truth for a while.  When and if you feel the need to help, be around them, but realize what's going on in those times, and if you can get them to realize the truth in themselves, then great, but don't try to fight anything or you will find yourself in their situation.  Being constantly around each other, either they will gravitate to your level, or you will to where they are. Do yourself a favor and spend at least a little time on your own. Regenerate the fucks they took from you, because there are so many good fucks to give. I obviously give a fuck about this in the same way you do. Use it."

Additionally since I am a strong person I feel that friends have occasionally tossed their problems my way then sat back and waited for me to fix things for them.  Eventually I became exhausted and at the point where you are now.  It took years for me to recognize this and decide one thing:  I can help people best (and serve myself best) by conducting my own life in a way that is a GOOD EXAMPLE.  Encourage them, do a couple random acts of kindness, but don't let their lack of enthusiasm for their own responsibilities be your anchor. And I second the suggestion of reading up on co-dependency.  You'll find you're not alone in this type of issue."

When I stopped being paranoid if I was interesting or not, I instantly became more interesting! Instead of being nervous to say some dry joke or a bad pun, I just did it. The result of that was that the kinds of guys who don't like my real qualities lost interest, and the kinds of guys who do like my real qualities became more interested. Win, win!   When you clear your mind of all of those questions, you have more room to have fun and interesting thoughts. Plus, the new confidence is immediately apparent to others. I swear, like the first time I used this philosophy I had a great night, even though I didn't end up getting a number or taking a guy home. I just had a great time, met lots of great people, and felt really great.  Game changer."
howtonotgiveafuck,31245j,chelbski-willis,8,Thu Apr 2 02:16:10 2015 UTC,"look at it like a filtering process: if you do you, perhaps even in overly pronounced way, you will attract those who will like you for just you and filter out those who don't. the self will always come through eventually, so might as well skip the part where you waste hours or days till you feel comfortable with opening up and find out right there and now if you two are going to be something."
howtonotgiveafuck,31245j,ninnu,5,Wed Apr 1 18:29:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's so important for people of either gender to just be themselves. What if you pretended to be or forced yourself to be all the things one particular person you are interested in will respond to? How long can you keep that up?     You won't just have everything about you magically change into being those things because you pretended or forced yourself to be them. You will be living a life of very difficult conflict inside of yourself. That will bleed out into your interactions and the other person might start thinking something is wrong with him or her, which can start a sort of reactionary pretending or forcing on that person's part.    Eventually, you aren't going to be able to continue pretending or forcing and then the relationship will explode or slowly fade away, either one very painfully, or you'll stay together because you already have so much shared history or maybe even have had kids together or something and now you're just living a long life of disappointment and bitterness that will not just bleed over each other but out to family members, friends, co-workers, neighbors, etc.     It may sound silly and simple, but the advice to be yourself (obviously, the forward moving parts of yourself, not the parts like the one that tells you if you stay in bed all day every day something will somehow happen to change your world for the better) can have very far reaching positive consequences."

Although I believe a positive personality goes a much farther way in terms of attractiveness.    Totally agree with this.   Financial stability is a race that few will win.   But won't agree with this.  Inevitably, we have enough control over our financial situation and most of the other things. To become financially rich, it just takes a perception change.  You yourself have mentioned that,   The easiest way to do this is to ignore the perception other people have of you or even the effect they may have on you.   So if you change the perception towards money, you can also become financially rich.  These could be a starting point towards that,   The Secret - A Movie on Law of Attraction r/LawOfAttraction"

howtonotgiveafuck,30v1rc,P4PChamp,40,Mon Mar 30 23:00:04 2015 UTC,"This is the best possible outcome, brother. I got caught up with a girl last summer. I was in so deep I couldn't see what was so blatantly obvious to everyone else. She was playing the shit outta me, still flirting and talking and laying her head on my chest when we were together, even after she started dating one of my friends. It was a shitty experience, but I'm glad I went through it. I came out stronger, more wary, and perhaps a bit wiser.   I hold to a very strict policy now: if she doesn't make the same effort to talk to me as I do to talk to her, it's time to move on. If I have to initiate conversation every time, she's clearly not that into me. In the end, it's made me more comfortable with myself, which I believe is the key to mental peace. Being an introvert means I've always been comfortable with solitude, but I'm no longer worried about keeping someone interested. If they're not interested, I move on. I'm okay with being alone, because I'd rather continue living how I always have than jump into a relationship with no substance."

I always create expectations in my head and then when things don't pan out as I had hoped, I get sorely disappointed - even if it's such a minor thing.  Stop being mad at yourself - instead, take that energy and introspect! Analyze what had happened, how it came to that, and just learn from the experience, then move on. Vent away, man, I wish I had done it more often in the past instead of letting things boil inside me. So unhealthy."

She was cute, people were saying we looked good together when we hanged, so I guess that's where my expectations came from. Then we took it up a notch to ""BFF"". It's in quotes because it was half joking when I was saying that she was my best friend. Then with all these things in my head about how she liked me and all, I decided to take the plunge. Bam. I mean, it wasn't a big deal because we weren't really that close and all but all the things in my head coupled with the rejection made me not give a fuck anymore. Now I have an Afro."

No one can give up on you because no one knows everything about you—past, present, and future—that would be needed as a basis on which they could make that decision.

howtonotgiveafuck,30verw,JustinAuthorAshol,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Other posters have said ""fuck them"". I dont think thats the best approach. If youre having mental problems, that means that you most likely dont have the mental foundations. I dont mean this in an offensive way. Im saying this from personal experience. When I was depressed, numb and suffered severe self esteem issues and SA, I couldn't deal with my problems effectively because I lacked the foundation. I don't know what issues you have or what exactly bat shit crazy classifies as, but you need to work on yourself. NGAF means a lot more then simply not giving a fuck. It also means giving a fuck about your well being, pursuits and passions, while NGAF about the obstacles (like negative people). It also means NGAF about the things you cant change (like having big ears). You can improve mental health. My best advice to give to you is to give a fuck and work on your well being. A good place to start for you may be setting small goals towards improving your mental health and to work on your confidence.There's a lot of helpful links in this sub and other subs that you can look into. You can also message me if you want and I can tell you some of the things that have helped me (previous posts/articles/tips) and are currently helping me. As a previous poster said realize that their reaction is one to the situation. I think thats also a good start. Also if you do decide to change do it for yourself, not for them.

Not giving a fuck what others think of you does not mean you don't have to care about your skin. If you are interested in improving your skin quality keep doing your research.

Don't let anything get in the way of your dreams, especially not the social illusion that acne is in any way, shape, or form, something that determines your value as a human being.  And, like every social bullshit that's crammed down our throats until we believe it, it only limits you if you give it the power to do so.    I ain't sayin it's  not easy to dig yourself out of the societal paradigms that want to keep you (and everyone else) down.  But if you don't work through it, it'll consume you your entire life.

Adoption of certain personality traits in an artificial fashion (I.e ""be more optimistic"", ""laugh more"") are contrivances. They are not genuine. If you are having a shit day, pretending to laugh so that you can fulfill a requisite that you have self imposed is only laying further 'giving a fuck' on top of your attempt to not give a fuck. In effect, you are giving a fuck about not giving a fuck.  Be very careful in regard to this kind of stuff. While it's extremely well intentioned and you sound like a very positive and energized individual, this kind of adoption of contrived  mental attitudes verges on mania."
howtonotgiveafuck,30n5ti,JustinAuthorAshol,0,Sun Mar 29 21:07:22 2015 UTC,"Be very careful in regard to this kind of stuff. While it's extremely well intentioned and you sound like a very positive and energized individual, this kind of adoption of contrived mental attitudes verges on mania.   Yeah be careful, because not giving a fuck can be... dangerous.  This is exactly the type of social programming bullshit you got to watch out for.  People worrying about your safety if you don't-give-a-fuck too much.    That's shit. Don't eat it. It's poison. The ""don't-give-a-fuck-too-much-is-dangerous"" is, itself dangerous.  And that's not a contradiction, that's a paradox. The paradox proves the point.  There's no such thing as safety.  Choose safety out of fear or freedom out of courage.  Give a shit about what other people think, or dontgiveashit."
howtonotgiveafuck,30n5ti,themodernritual,3,Mon Mar 30 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"Not giving a fuck can be dangerous.  If you don't give a fuck about your hygiene, you stink. If you don't give a fuck about what you eat, you become unhealthy. If you don't give about the well being of others, and cause others harm, you're an asshole. If you don't give a fuck about your education, or indeed about what is real and what isn't, you turn deluded.  What I am warning OP about is adopting a position excessively. Certainly, to have a good attitude will hold you in good stead to pave the way for a beneficial and enriching life, but there is a fine line between adopting a positive mental attitude and indulging in contrivances.  A contrivance is acting in a way that you are not in the hope to be something. It's exactly the same as the salesman who is dirt poor but spends his money on a good car to appear successful. Excessive indulgences in contrivances, in my experience, leads to a deluded mind. Why? Because when you start drinking your own Kool Aid, it's difficult to discern what is real and what isn't.   Saying blanket statements like ""Confidence is the best quality a human being can have"" like they are empirical laws is exceptionally dangerous thinking. Especially, when applying a little bit of philosophical discourse around the statement, it falls apart.  Confidence can turn into arrogance in the blink of an eye, and falling under the spell of ones own confidence can lead to seeing things with a lack of clarity. Arrogance and contrivance are states of mind that impede beneficial and clear thinking.  I have met many people who have exuded confidence, but when you check underneath the hood, there is little-to-no-experience and an even lesser application of wisdom.  Confidence can get you a great deal of things in life, but it's ridiculous to suggest it should be a human being's highest aspiration.  I would much take a person who quietly gives half their sandwich to a homeless person over a person who exuded excessive confidence simply for the sake of it.  Nothing wrong with having confidence, but being a genuine individual is far more important."
howtonotgiveafuck,30n5ti,JustinAuthorAshol,2,Mon Mar 30 08:25:41 2015 UTC,"And none of that conflicts with anything that I or the OP said.  To be fair, my point can be made more clear:   Giving a fuck is dangerous. Not giving a fuck is dangerous.  Fear that giving-a-fuck-is-dangerous is dangerous. Fear that not-giving-a-fuck-is-dangerous is dangerous.   Life is just fucking dangerous.  But what holds people back is fear.  So what do you want to do?  You want to breathe life into people but then you got scared about what you said?  You want to say, ""HTNGAF, but oh yeah... also be careful cuz u might get hurt?""    Look, you can create a motto How To Give a Fuck or How To Not Give a Fuck and they can both end up in the same place: authentic personality that is stripped away from society's negative influences and then redeveloped into something else.  But what exactly is that ""something else""?  If someone really follows this philosophy, the only thing at the end of this road is either (a) personal freedom or (b) death.  I mean, if you encourage someone to just NGAF, they might go out and do something... stupid and dangerous.    And so what is your belief?  ""Waaah we can't have that! We can't really just NGAF!""  OR  ""Hell yeah that's what I'm talking about, NGAF is how you learn to fly.""  Because the former is fear and the latter is freedom.  It's fear or freedom.  One or the other.  There is no inbetween because everything inbetween is fear.  Do you want people to live their absolute 100% potential, or do you want people to to live 99% their potential, ""Just To Be Safe"" ?  Because, you know, that last 1% is dangerous.  That might hurt someone.  But you don't really have control over what people do once their free.  The creator of this philosophy doesn't have control over that.   Now I want to caveat all this... I don't know the guy who created this and nothing I say is meant to reflect on him in real life.  Sounds like a nice guy that's still trying to find his own path.  Like who isn't?   But the age of the guru is dead. And what's replaced the guru?  The modern system.  The one that fucking kills people before their dead.  Slowly.  And painfully.  Starting at like age 10 or 13 or what fuck ever.  And that painful life can last a long time until someone is 70+.  So the question becomes, should the creator of this philosophy try to guide people into being ""good people"", and Giving A Fuck?  That's OK only in a very generic sense, but what does ""giving a fuck"" look like?  See, if the creator of this philosophy tries to define that, he's only going to inject his own personal ideologies which is missing the point entirely (even though he came up with the idea).    (He doesn't have to do that.  There's another way.)  People should be encouraged to be free.  Like, without fear of being free.  This philosophy has the teeth to be a path to freedom, but only if followed in the spirit of total freedom.  Anything less than total freedom is a slippery slope back down to believing in the lies of modern society that traps people into believing the same bullshit line that they weren't free in the first place.  And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"

First of all, the answer to, ""is this acceptable/creepy"" is neither of the following:   No it's not creepy!  It's ok! Don't worry if it is because if she thinks it is, then she'll say no and you'll never see her again!   You see, both of those answers contain a mental state called Fear of Not Giving A Fuck (FONGAF)  Now one might call it Desire to Give A Fuck (DTGAF) You can look at it either way.  But when you're learning HTNGAF it's best to think about FONGAF.  Because that's what's going to be your own personal guide HTNGAF.  Get in touch with that fear.  Listen for it.  Be comfortable with it.  Because it's been with you for so very long, and you've always just tried to deny it or push it away because it's icky.  But really, FONGAF is your friend.  It's your guide to learn HTNGAF.  In this case, others have replied with some of the FONGAF reactions: attempts to comfort, appease and rationalize.   No it's not creepy!  It's ok!  This is an attempt to comfort you.  But see, if you allow yourself to feel good because someone said this, you're Giving A Fuck about what this person is saying.  And that's not what we're here for.  Go to /r/pleasegiveafuckaboutme if that's what you want. Don't worry if it is because if she thinks it is, then she'll say no and you'll never see her again!  This response is a little trickier.  It's saying the reason it's OK to do that is because if she thinks it is, then it will be OK because you won't ever see her again.  But think about it.  What if you did see her again?  Like every day, for some reason.  And she had friends?  And they were in your social circle or school or something?   The key here is this...   I was just wondering if this kind of behavior is acceptable since I don't want to come out as creepy.   Now that's nothing necessarily ""wrong"" with asking others if this is creepy.  You can get advice and yada yada yada.  But this subreddit is about learning howtonotgiveafuck.  So that's where we need to go on this.  In order to learn howtonotgiveafuck, the first thing you gotta do is be aware of those times yougiveafuck.  Because that's when you can practice notgivingafuck!  It's like a muscle really.  And you don't have to do heavy lifting at first cuz that can really hurt you.  Of course, we're not talking about any kind of givingafuck.  We're talking about those givingafucks that are based on fear and hold you back.    So your fear is whether or not this is creepy.  Fuck who cares? Do it because you want to do it!  And don't wait for a ""chance"" to occur.  You have given yourself an assignment:   Go out to the mall and tell ten girls Hey, I just didn't want to let the opportunity pass and not compliment your beautiful smile.  My name is Owlshitty.   I could go into some more detail on suggestions and shit, but all of that is really blah blah blah shit.  Just go do it.  The point here is to find out HTNGAF.  Now the deeper shit is, why does it matter if what you do is creepy?  Why does that matter?  And what does ""creepy"" mean?  Who's the ""Judge of Creepiness"".  I'll tell you fucking who. You!  You judge if something is creepy or not creepy.  And don't give a fuck what other people think.  Tell someone they're creepy.  Tell someone they're not creepy.  Who in this fucking world has the absolute DEVINE right to judge anything that you ever fucking do as creepy?  Other people are NOT GOD.  Other people are not your judge or jury.  The truth of the matter is, there is no such thing as creepy behavior.  How many people have to believe something is creepy before it is?  One?  Two?  Ten?  One Billion?  Who the fuck cares!  You tell me.  Are you creepy?  You gotta answer that right now (and the answer better be a FUCK NO!). :)  Are you creepy?  No.  You are not. That's HTNGAF.  You decide what's right.  You decide what's wrong.  You don't let anyone else decide what's appropriate or inappropriate. Not. Fucking. Ever.  See really, you gotta follow these feelings down to their roots so you can pull them up, cuz they're weeds.  :)  Here's some takeaways:   Nice dream.  :) Go for it. Watch for FOGAF.  Watch for it both in yourself and others.  Learn to spot it. Begin the process of digging them out.  Take your time.

I get what you're saying how I just should just notgiveafuck and do whatever I want based on my own rationalization of the situation. The thing is, I just don't want to be this person who just doesn't give a fuck and do whatever I want. I believe there are certain limitations about what you can do. Sometimes, just notgivingafuck may be morally wrong (e.g. Hitting on this girl with a boyfriend because I know I can have her).   But given my dream, your advice is amazing!"

howtonotgiveafuck,30fjnz,C2-H5-OH,3,Thu Mar 26 23:18:58 2015 UTC,"I'm going to address this from the point of view of HTNGAF.  I'm not going to give you advice on how to break up with a girl you're not even dating.  First of all, it's not going to change a damn thing but maybe make it more awkward, and second of all, that's stupid as fuck and you'll regret it.  Look I know your suffering, but ""taking control"" by telling her no is asking for holy hell.  How the fuck do you think she's going to take that?  Like maybe, telling all her friends that you thought she was interested in you?  Giggle.  Even if she was, that's the kind of reaction that can happen.  But you think she'll give you roses for saying some shat like that?  Don't for one second think that would make this situation better.  You are in extreme danger here.  You're stuck in a room, afraid of the granades in your belt, and you think the solution is to pull the fucking pin.  Yeah, this is the kind of fucking mistake that can wound a man for life.  And it's not because ""girls are bitches"" or anything.  Well maybe they can be, but that's only one way of looking at it.  A girl might recover her own sense of ego in the matter through social sharing.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That's just how it works.    Now /u/lordlaser9 had the correct diagnosis for you the first time round with ""This is a classic case of oneitis.""  I'll say the same thing a little more emphatically.  For the love of all that's holy get yourself the fuck over to /r/seduction and start doing some challenges ASAP. That'll give you some confidence and experience to stop ruminating and it'll give your mind someone other things to fantasize about.  Then the last thing is HTNGAF about this girl.  You're scared shitless because she's giving you some indication of interest.  Think of it like this.  It's a game.  But there are bullets.  Like, for real.  You're in fucking combat.  You cannot wish it away.  And you're probably going to die.  And there's only one goddamn way out of this hell hole.  And that's not around her.  It's through her.  Yup.  That's your only way out.  Forward. Not backward.  And not fucking lying on the floor curled up in a fetal position.  Get the fuck up you damned coward!  Get up and march forward and fight and Don't Give A Fuck and be prepared to fucking die you piss piece of shit.  .  .  . And ask her to hang out for pizza and games or something and have a good time.  And when the smoke clears you'll be lucky if you can get yourself the fuck back here before you're half broken and half dead.  But you'll be wearing the scars of battle and pain and glory and not the tales of a half forgotten dream of a life that never happened. No.  I am not going to lead you down that foggy path of a forgotten life.  That would be fucking inhumane.  I'd take mercy on your soul and shoot you in the fucking head and put you out of your misery before I'd lead you down that sorry road.  Because I'm your only true goddamn friend around here.    So this is one way HTNGAF about something.  Make it into a game.  A game of life and death.  Oh, and it's fucking real.  Because you're going to come out wounded or victorious.  But put it in some terms of some game that takes you away from the hum drum of daily life.  If you cannot fantasize less, fantasize more. But take control of that fantasy in a way that will help you get through life.  That can charge your brain up to see things in new ways and have fun in life again. And oh yeah, be prepared to die motha fuckah!"

Maybe you need to do that and have closure before you can truly NGAF. I had a similar experience with a friend who disappeared when I fell into deep depression. He claimed he didn't want to upset me, but the truth is he was scared and confused. Ultimately I told him that I really wished he'd been there for me and it change the way I felt about him. Being honest felt really good and I could move on.   So if you want to proceed, rather than blow up on him, just calmly say, ""Funny how you haven't changed much. I've gone through some tough times and am grateful for the people who stood by me. Those are the only people who's opinions matter to me.""  That will shut him down because you've made it clear his words mean nothing to you.   Who knows, maybe he actually grew up and will apologize for being a tool."

You don't have to prove yourself. You already have. You were invited there because you were wanted there.   When you're there, appreciating the fact that you were invited to be a part of your friend's awesome day, make an effort to be present. When I am in the midst of potentially stressful times, repeating ""be here now"" is effective for grounding. Get out of your head. Everyone else will be having their own thoughts about the food, the decor, the friends, the music, the whatever. If anyone is spending that day thinking about you and what a loser they hope you are, that's pretty sad. Go ahead and acknowledge that for a moment, that it's pretty sad they would use this awesome day and your friend's great gesture in inviting you to be negative and gossip-y. But stop there. You won't be dragged into that negativity. You were invited because you are inherently great, so just do your natural thing and be inherently great there, eating some nice free food, maybe meeting some great new people. Get your dance on.   If Vincent wants to start something, that is unusual because it means he is bringing his own negativity into this positive, celebratory day. Don't engage with that, don't take on his garbage. If he decides he wants to be catty, he'll be catty whether you are there are not. It's not personal, it's not about you. It's about the frustrations and self-loathing thoughts that have been building up in him for the past 3.5++ years. Not your problem. Feel pity for him if you want, that he'd cloud his own potentially fun day with such negativity, but don't let your thoughts of him affect the fact that you were invited to a pretty sick party full of people who clearly love you and appreciate you enough to want to share that experience with you."

An introvert would stay at home exactly because they would know that people they consider annoying like that would be there. And for an introvert, this usually carries more weight than the meaning of the event itself.  I'm no psychologist though. Just speaking from experience.  Of course, it also depends on what his/her friends really are like. From the description, they don't sound like very nice people. Or maybe I'm just seeing them from an introvert's perspective.

If my intention is good, then I have done a good job"".   That quote (might have to search for the exact video, should be on Youtube somewhere) has stuck with me ever since. Over the course of years I have applied it as ""I don't control other people. I only control myself and my intention. What other people think about it... well I couldn't care less"".

It was the hardest of the three calculuses and the least applicable to the stuff I tend to do nowadays. I also took it as a high school student at community college in my last semester senior year, which made it even harder with everything else going on.  Calc I and III are far more useful - hell, Calc III was actually kinda fun and made more sense because it applies to so much stuff in the real world. Keep at it though. Integrals are tough as nails and there's a lot to memorize. I got a B+, B-, and a B in I/II/III, and it didn't stop me from making my way to the top. Somehow I scored an A+ in DiffEq though. I promise it gets better, but I also promise it's important.  The further I go in my studies, the more I realize how important calculus is. Think of math as a giant willow tree. Everything you learned up to this point - EVERYTHING, from Day 1 of 1st grade math until now - is the dirt and roots of the tree, the foundation upon which everything comes together. Calculus is the trunk of that tree. It's thick, heavy, and stiff, but all higher math grows from it. You can cheat by trying to grab a hanging willow and climb up it that way, but you'll only know the end of that branch and not how you got there. Once you're past the trunk, the material is lighter, you can jump around easier, it's not so stiff, and that's where things really happen.  A note on Wolfram Alpha - sure, it's nice to use the tools at your disposal in the modern world, but you better know how to set up the problem in the first place. That's the thing about math - actually doing the problem is for plebeian computers to figure out. Humans are the ones who set up the problem and know why the solution is the right one.  Good luck!"

Better grades land you in a better starting spot. This sub's philosophy is replacing anxiety with a focus on progressing in health, wealth, love, and self-awareness.  Too often I see comments in this sub that appear to come from the approach that they are saying the fuck with everything because the world is fragile and we're destined to fail anyway, so I'm going to do what I want. While I'm all for that, no way of life one chooses is better than another IMO. But I also see this sub as way to remind oneself and learn about letting go of the stuff that you can't control and focus on what you can control.  I also want to mention that although A's can help land better jobs and ultimately pay for your degree, it is surely not the only way or necesarily the best way to make a living. Its all about what individual path you choose to focus on to progress in health, wealth, love, and self-awareness.

howtonotgiveafuck,303jhr,thecowninja,6,Tue Mar 24 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"Because she makes you happy, or at least she did... And that's normal. But you have to look at another pretty girl. Is she pretty to you? Imagine now the fact (this is true) that she can mean just as much and MUCH more to you than the girl you're obsessed over. That is the truth, I wouldn't lie to you. This lets you know that it is true that you are not bound to anyone other than of your own choosing.   Love requires two participants to hold a relationship together and create the ONE relationship. However if she doesn't care, why should you? She is not a goddess, she is not your over lord. You are equal, you are equally as attractive, sexy, beautiful, nice, kind... so why do you look for her recognition when the thing is you are equal if not better in many cases? Don't sweat it man, you've got this because you are you, and you are on equal grounds. She'll regret not giving you a chance because she'll see who you really are. She can't see who you really are until you see though. So better not waste anymore time. ;)"

But with this cloud, the harder you fight it, the larger and darker it gets.  Move into the feeling to extinguish it. It demands to be heard. So face it. Feel it.  Try meditation.  It's helped me considerably.  Also, pick up 'The Happiness Trap' by Dr Russ Harris.  Don't judge your emotions. You feel what you feel. That's totally cool. You might be afraid of judgement and that's okay too. You're allowed to feel it.  To not give a fuck, you need to accept that you do give a fuck and then give all the fucks you possibly can.  Only then will you be free."

I can definitely relate to the feeling of spending all your time in ""what if"" land, I think the hard part is the come down when none of the ""what if's"" actually happen. So I don't try to stop myself thinking those thoughts I just tell myself to be honest that most likely they'll never happen. But there's always that chance and that's the killer."
howtonotgiveafuck,303jhr,MrMez,2,Tue Mar 24 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"I find what helps is to bring your perspective back into balance with reality. What tends to happen with objects of affection is they begin to start a life of their own in your fantasies. The girl becomes this specter of beauty that you can't get out of your head... and it is at this point you are no longer imagining this girl, but your conceptualization of the perfect woman. So I think in order to get over 'giving a fuck', you need to realize that the fantasy you have in your mind is not congruent with the reality of this person.   Try to imagine some of her less attractive traits. Not to diminish her, but to see her as a human being, and not this ungraspable fantasy girl. Work on this until you break this illusion that she's irresistible or perfect, she's not. Remember it is the fact that you cannot have her that makes you want her. We all chase that which recedes from us. But realize this is a trick of your mind.   Then put your efforts into pursuing other girls who are available to you and are willing to put forth the same effort towards you as you do towards them. It is never healthy to live a life of craving... you tend to get caught up in your own web of illusions and grow in frustration over time. Cut your way out and see your path towards freedom."
howtonotgiveafuck,303jhr,Hippostalker,2,Tue Mar 24 13:31:32 2015 UTC,"This sounds like the stupidest way in the world, but it works.   Every time you find yourself daydreaming about her, pick a celebrity, and replace her with that celebrity.   When your mind says ""but I don't..it's not her..."" you tell yourself ""Well, too fucking bad, that's not an option"". (Will also help in the future when you run across that one person that inevitably is married or otherwise unavailable.)  It's easier, because there's usually a ton of information out there about a celebrity to help keep you sidetracked until time has passed (because that's really all that fixes broken hearts).   The only thing I must caution you with is allowing yourself to be overwhelmed with fascination with the celebrity...because that can be just as unhealthy as being attracted to an unavailable girl.   People usually say ""start a new hobby"" or ""exercise"", which are all good ways to distract yourself, but those don't handle those moments when your brain is releasing 'feel good chemicals' because you are daydreaming about her.   It usually takes only a couple of times of interrupting your ... ""private time"" to start back down the HTNGAF path."

PEACE BITCH""  Not in those words maybe but you know what i mean, sometimes when something is grinding you its better to just handle it and get it out of your head no matter how awkward it feels. Just count to three and do it.  The just count to three and do it is an excellent way for shit with the opposite sex either way in my experience.

Luckily, we had a few friends that also lived with us, but it was still pretty brutal.  We were civil, but you could practically feel the tension in the air.  We went from back to acting like we were dating to bitter enemies several times a week.  The best way, in my opinion, to deal with a situation like this is to just press on through it.  Trying your hardest not to pay her any sort of thought until it happens naturally is what I did.  The more you dwell on it the harder it will get to let go and the more your feelings about the situation will fluctuate.

Would you consider yourselves on good or bad terms? Is there anything you could say to her today, right now, that wouldn't be awkward, or is it an unavoidable awkward situation? The way I see it you have a few options depending on the answers to the questions.   If she never reciprocated feelings at all, you need to just leave it be. Time is truly the only thing that heals the heart. Except for... Find someone else to GAF about. Especially if you can start giving more fucks about yourself and your own opinions that of other people's opinions. You sound like you're in college, so there's got to be a decent selection. If you feel like you're undesirable get in the gym. No matter how ugly your face is and awkward your speech is, if you have muscles at least some girls will be interested in you.

Also what you said makes no sense. I can't compare them because they're not the same thing. Depression can be brought on by a variety of factors. This is a situation about a guy that feels embarrassed about a girl, it's very specific. Depression smoothers a persons life in every case were this is a situation that can vary greatly in severity.   So hopefully my advice will work because it worked for me. I just brushed it off and kept going."

I'm not saying wish it away, I'm saying accept it and move on, don't let it hold you down by taking any more of your time, it's not worth it, stop thinking about her is how this is achieved.  If they can't do that then they have a serious problem that therapy may only resolve, if this is more than just a embarrassing moment and actually does trigger signs of depression, which I doubt it will because he should feel proud for stepping outside of the comfort zone. It's a healthy approach. If you want to throw the usual argument, anything can be interpreted by anyone differently, you can but we'll be here all night.  Also, bad analogy. You where on the right track with food but fell at the end. What your saying implies there is a way to solve the issue completely and completely dissolve the pain, it can only be managed.  Your analogy works in my favour if you say ""ok, I'm hungry, but sitting here thinking/obsessing won't solve anything, in need to go get food/help"".  They mentioned they were anxious too, which may bring on depression if they get stressed enough. In which case, my advice won't work because they probably need therapy due to various factor we don't have information about."

It is called extrapolating, he can take our limited words and turn it into a system that works for him, it does not work as well when you give every step for him to walk, he has to create his own path, not walk someone else's.

My Dad's family is that way. It takes 6 months of marination, but positive behavior changes sometimes occur.   I've also had situations where a friend suggested solutions A and B to me, I've found reasons asto why they didn't work, but in the process of criticizing the suggestions, I've discovered ways to adapt and combine ideas so as to create my own solution C that's more viable to me for whatever reasons.

I come from a broken home. You: Don't give a fuck about that shit!  Everyone has a hard fucking life.  You just need to learn HTNGAF...  Friend: Oops, I forgot that my presentation is today.

It's not that I wouldn't want to play with them, it's that I don't mind playing without them. I didn't launch that game to play with my friends, I just wanted to play.   I love playing games with my friends, as anyone would. I also love playing games with lobbies full of randoms. I just want to play. If you're friends are playing with a full party, play with new people. If they have an opening, see if they're going to keep playing.  I don't know what games your referencing here, but it sounds like a moba or cs:go from the zero context clues I got. These are great games to expand playgroups with forced team play. Conveniently also giving you more opportunities to make friends to play with if yours are busy/full.   To answer your question about htngaf, motivation is hard to pinpoint on a personal, case-by-case level. I've fired up anything from State of Emergency to Flower to expunge distress after a long day. Day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment, what drives actions changes. Maybe they're not in the mood to play with you, maybe they haven't seen that you're online, maybe they're actually on the toilet and their status is out of date.   Just because your friends don't immediately invite you doesn't mean they don't want to play with you. They may feel putting the onus on you to respond to an invite feels bad to them. It might feel as bad to them as having to ask to be able to play with them feels to you.  In any case, gonna wrap this post up with some Kendrick Lamar lyrics. ""They say communication saves relations, I can tell. | But I could never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real."" Talk to your friends. They're just wandering through life like you - with video games."

Do mind your protein intake is sufficient. I actually think the term 'hard-gainer' is often used too quickly. You say you couldn't gain weight when you worked out at your dad's gym, I would blame it on not eating enough."

howtonotgiveafuck,2zu4x6,lahlahlollies,4,Sat Mar 21 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree (tho' I'd have agreed during most of my teens/twenties!). Drama is of course exciting, but happiness can be exciting if you make it so - setting new challenges or just doing something (big or small) you really love. People often contrast (painful but intense) drama, which takes effort (physical/mental/emotional) to deal with, and happiness, which is often accompanied by no effort (""if it ain't broke, why fix it?""). But happiness does not necessarily equal a lack of effort. Inertia can be boring. Happiness has been defined as a ""flow"" state where you lose track of time/awareness of self by being absorbed in a task that is tricky, but not beyond you.  So yeah, I agree pain is usually more dramatic, but happiness can be dramatic too."
howtonotgiveafuck,2zu4x6,AboveAllBeKind,3,Sun Mar 22 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"You're not completely wrong. I find it weird that we seek happiness but when we are truly happy, we don't even acknowledge it. We just take it for granted and experience it, like you said. It's not until later that we look back and realize how happy we actually were, I think due to the memories we make.  Embrace everything, even the sad times. True acceptance is what pulls you through. Feel whatever the fuck you're feeling in the moment."
howtonotgiveafuck,2zu4x6,jbtk,2,Sat Mar 21 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say happiness is boring, but rather it's perhaps a bit stagnant?  Way I see it is, when you're in a really happy place in your life, it's nice to just feel relaxed and calm and safe and to just enjoy the simple things in life.  But being sad, or going through a tough time, is what allows us to grow as human beings.  It's what allows us to change and to become more beautiful.  And so you're right, crises are interesting because they provide the conditions for you to (hopefully) become a better version of you.    I was with a wonderful, fantastic girl for a year and a bit.  The relationship ended recently too, and while I desperately miss her and all the happiness being with her brought, I'm now in an exciting place where I can work on myself and change.  I have absolutely no idea what each day will bring and that's both terrifying and wonderful.  Of course I miss the happiness and the feeling of being grounded, of belonging, that comes with a good relationship.  But in the end, you're all you've got in this world.  Relationships come and go, crises come and go, you'll be happy and sad countless times and that's never going to change.  You have to accept the stage you're at and see the positives, that's how you don't give a fuck about being sad.  You look at it as an opportunity to grow.  Have fun with being single, friend!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2zu4x6,EnvyDemon,2,Tue Mar 24 02:48:46 2015 UTC,"""Happiness is a pause between two moments of suffering.""  You can be happy and still think on things! The way I see it is you must accept that suffering and happiness are a part of the yin and yang of life. It's light vs. dark. It's good vs. evil. You can't have one without the other. One is necessary for the other to exist. So, it's best to accept the struggles of life with an open mind, which is exactly what you're doing. Good on you, man, I'm proud of ya. Just know that happiness will come around again, this time with the lessons this bout of suffering brought you, so hopefully you'll appreciate it more and enjoy it to the fullest; because, believe me the good moments aren't boring, they are more of a reward."

Keep the motives of the critical person in mind, if their criticism is bothering you in an unhelpful way.   Does the person giving the criticism have any experience with what they're criticizing? Are they in direct competition with you?   If the person has nothing to gain and lots of experience with what they're criticizing then they're probably for real.

If something doesn't feel safe, don't go for it, but remember that most of our safety nets are much larger than we perceive them to me.

Sometimes we let our failure (or fear of failing) control us and instead of seeking a lesson in it, we give up or stop trying. We let doubt and criticism sink in, and dictate our actions.  If people want to see you fail, they are not worth listening too. But if they want to help you Learn from failure or mistakes, then definitely hear them out OP. Outside perspective is good as long we don't let it control us, or what we want to do.

The galaxies you see in this picture, are so far away it took 12 BILLION YEARS for its light to reach earth. Once you truly, completely appreciate just how big that is, you can compare it to the problems and negativity in your life, and realize, indeed, that compared to such never ending vastness your problems mean absolutely nothing.  Also realize, that you are apart of this grand vast universe, not seperate from it. And someday you will leave it, you will die. Memento Mori. Therefore, in your limited time here, you must make this life the best you can! Appreciate the good things, the beautiful things, and realize that you just don't have time for all the things negative and holding you back, hence not giving a fuck.  When most people wake up monday morning, they are discouraged, because they know that they are about to go back to work again for the 2,00th time. When I wake up monday morning, I am happy, because I know that there is a beautiful sunrise waiting for me, and that sometime through that day I will be talking to those who are close to me, and doing the things I love.

howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,wooterpooz,9,Tue Mar 17 17:19:27 2015 UTC,"I think this is the point I was trying to make: the reluctance/fear we have towards the unknown could be correlated with how vulnerable we feel in the world. I think the predator/prey analogy can be effective because 1) nobody wants to identify with prey and, 2) learning to see things more from a predator's perspective could work in the way an alter-ego would, by helping to boost confidence and giving a sense of place in the environment."

howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,Anaraky,6,Wed Mar 18 03:26:31 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is, even if we ignore the fact that animals and humans are quite different, is that the hard part isn't realizing that it would be best not to be afraid or have anxiety. Shit, who doesn't realize that? The hard part is actually making that shift.   Having butterflies in your stomach in the face of a new experience is quite natural. Whether you identify that with excitement or fear has, in my opinion, more to do with how many novel experiences you've had in your life up until that point. If you've shown yourself you can handle new environments before the downside is minimized and you can focus more on the upside. Or in other words, experience grants confidence. Lack of experience thus means lack of confidence. Suggesting people see themselves as prey are in my eyes quite absurd."

I agree with you and I was trying not be all ""hey! guess what? avoiding situations means you have anxiety! how about that?""  I guess the line just resonated somehow and I wanted to share it, though wasn't exactly sure how to place it in context.  Regardless of the liberties my post takes and the questionable logic, I still think it could be a useful way of framing things for some. I often find that by gaining awareness of the possible root causes of my behavior (whether or not they are the true cause) helps me to approach things differently in the future.  I think the prey vs. predator dichotomy packs quite a punch and could possibly be a useful motivator."

Successful people/animals make the most of change and use it to their advantage instead of being over-cautious.  Do things have to be 100% scientifically accurate if they are used as a little trick to open up ourselves to new opportunities and to overcome unnecessary fear? I don't think they do. I used to pretend to myself that I was a robot when I was training, I would imagine my arms and legs as hydraulic cylinders - sounds silly, completely unrealistic, but it stopped my arms and legs hurting and kept me going."

However I'm still hesitant regarding the rhetoric since a lot of areas within self-help has became quite high-strung much in thanks to adversarial, black and white thought processes such as alpha vs beta or predator vs prey. Pushing yourself is good, but I've seen people that think you need to do it constantly and in all circumstances.   There isn't some big scoreboard that tallies up all the stuff you've done, there isn't an award ceremony at the end of the road. This type of dichotomy ignores that fact, and ignores the fact that you need the relaxing yin to the ambitious yang.  These are just my thoughts though and if people can use the mindset without getting too wound up about it, then it's all great. I feel like some caution is required though."
howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,Skycakes,3,Tue Mar 17 23:10:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about dichotomies is that they make powerful rhetoric. That's why the often become popular as well.  Personally I don't think they're problematic unless you ignore edge cases. This or that comparisons simplify complex issues, and cut through to the heart of the issue (when used correctly of course). But they're not rules to live and die by. They're more useful for explanations. And I think it's the people who don't realize that who misuse them. For this article I think it comes down to a simple question: do you see your surroundings as a threat, or an opportunity? And the answer can tell you a lot about yourself.  Or confirm what you already know."
howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,emiellucifuge,2,Wed Mar 18 02:30:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe then, to embrace the uncomfortable even when it feels unnatural. Force oneself to find as many uncomfortable situations as possible and push through.   The way I look at it : if you are comfortable with what you are doing you are not doing it right. It is good to be out of your comfort zone. (obviously with restrictions. It doesn't mean you need to sleep outside in a cardboard box in the winter time just to be 'uncomfortable')"
howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,emiellucifuge,2,Tue Mar 17 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"Depends really. That mindset you described is great if you don't have many novel experiences or haven't faced a lot of high-pressure situations. However it is important to realize it's just a tool and not a be-all-end-all lifestyle as I've seen some people come to think of it as. As when you've done enough shit in your life you realize that you can handle pretty much anything if it comes down to it. Maybe you'll do well, maybe you'll do poorly. Either way, everything will be fine. And at that point, you can afford to pick and choose between the experiences you'd actually like to have without being restricted by anxiety."

Both carnivores and herbivores have reason to be wary in new environments. Even if you're at the top of the food chain you still must be careful of dangers both from the environment as well as from competing members of your species. Also, there are advantages to new territories that prey animals can take advantage of. That's why you see ungulates migrating in vast herds across continents.  For me, life is a delicate balance about giving a fuck about the right things and not the wrong things. It's important to be wary of danger when there is dangerous shit happening. It's not wise to not give a fuck about looking before crossing the street. Does this mean I'm cultivating a ""prey mentality""? No, it's just common sense. What's appropriate is to sit and take time to truly evaluate the reasons why you are hesitant about new situations. There is no need to appeal to one's animal nature to do that.   P.S.- I'm not trying to be combative and if this works for you that's great. I'm just offering an alternative perspective."
howtonotgiveafuck,2zd2uz,Doriphor,9,Tue Mar 17 20:13:59 2015 UTC,I agree with this - the predator/prey analogy has no actual basis in biology.  What about predators that are also prey? Only a tiny proportion of predators are at the top of the food chain.

Humans are unique in their capacity for all sorts of behaviors, liquidity of mindset, and helping each other.  To see the world in terms of those who prey and those who are preyed on seems rather bleak IMO.  Sure, dogs may be predators and get excited over new surroundings, but not all dogs are like that, and it doesn't logically follow that to like novelty means you are a ""predator"".  If all Apples are Fruits, it doesn't mean that all Fruits are Apples."

howtonotgiveafuck,2z00lj,bluntbangs,6,Sat Mar 14 15:46:43 2015 UTC,What if my life was better 5 years ago?
howtonotgiveafuck,2z00lj,that1guywithredhair,11,Sun Mar 15 02:33:34 2015 UTC,"Examine HOW it was better. Why.   You can even specifically state how and why here if you want? (I.e. that doesn't need to be rhetorical, what I'm asking). For example, my life was better five years ago in the sense that I had a stable job. It was worse in the sense that the relationship I was in was suffocating.   So I'm going to look towards building what was better then (my career) and not replicating what was bad (that type of relationship).  I think on paper Five Years Ago might look better, because of the financial steadiness. But in truth, I'm glad I'm not so scared of my ex anymore. Money is a necessity, but my mental health is more important.  I think the five year rule has to include updates for how the world is now, because it's changed too. The employment market is shittier than it was, and it's really telling in my profession and city. It's a dead industry. So I'm going back to uni to finish off my degree and changing industries entirely, working part-time while I do it. So in five years time I'll have a job that will realistically still be around (the healthcare sector is what I've chosen as it's a pretty defensive sector and should continue to spawn jobs. I know some research suggests around 50% of existing professions will be made redundant by 2025).    So I think this period also feels better than five years ago because I'm actively pursuing a way to fix current issues. Five years ago I didn't have to worry, but now I do; five years ago I SHOULD have been worried, but I was myopic. I'm less myopic now. Or at least I'm aiming to be, so that's the right place to start.   EDIT: Do you really have red hair? (Mine is reddish.) Hey, things are already looking better. Red hair was the fodder for ginger and 'ranga jokes five years ago. That kind of mentality has died off. I've noticed TV shows and films deliberately selecting people with red hair as being the epitome of beauty. In Game of Thrones it's called ""kissed by fire"" (actually the name of the episode focusing on two red-headed women, Sansa and Ygritte) and in The Walking Dead it's called Abraham Is Frigging Awesome. (This character and actor is single-handedly making red hair on a man look sexy-fiery, to the point where when I actively have the hots for this actor now. Hmmm.) In True Blood, which I've only glimpsed, red hair seems to be Alpha Hot, with the two main redheads being the sex bombs of the show.   Hey, anyone wanna sign my Red Hair Hotness Is Back (Elizabethan Period 2: The Reawakening) petition?   Also, I know TV and film don't make for a happy life - they're escapism. But haven't you noticed that TV shows and films are getting better? The broadness and levels of escapism are improving. Yes, there's still a lot of crap out there (i'm not fond of reality TV shows involving cooking and DIY or home renovation), but there's smart and/or humorous shows out there now that can intelligently bring you out of yourself - Breaking Bad, Nathan For You (hilarious, check him out), Louis Theroux's docos, even GoT is an entertaining watch (and you can channel all your life hatred into hating Joffrey or Cesei or Ramsay, attune any horniness into the ample nudity.)  And while we're probably looking down the barrel of another Fast & Furious movie, at least there's a Blackfish out there to compensate for the latest Transformers disaster. Someone lifted the bar, somewhere. Even music is improving - I love musical scores for film, and now that Hans Zimmer is being elbowed by all these great artists (Zack Hempsey! Trent Reznor! Atticus Ross! etc) flooding the space... well, my playlist has benefited significantly.   You're still the man, Hans. BWWWWOAARMMMM! (Inception sound)"

What do you see? (PM me if you like?).  I'm of the opinion that most people alive today are of a confused generation. I'm sure every generation says that of itself and I'm sure they are right. But does the fact that it's been going on for a long time (humans who are blessed with intelligence are also ""blessed"" with the knowledge of their entrapment or suffocation or whatever it is that keeps one's natural spirits deflated) mean that it has to keep on spinning?   No. Someone can at least TRY to at least assuage the waves that drown us. Even (especially) those waves that are of our own design.  An answer, something that makes a difference, is what matters.  If anyone wants to take this theory a step further, or propose an alternative line of thought, please PM me. I've published two (non-fiction, psychological development) books so far. Dull textbooks on bullying and conflict resolution.   My history: I have decided, since I was a child (long story), to remain unmarried and without children. I decided to make my life my own and try to give something back. I'm still (37F) of the same thinking.  Has it occurred to many redditers out there that we often give advice to strangers that is MORE BENEFICIAL than the advice of a psychologist? (I have the psych degree, have seen many psychologists, and can say whole-heartedly that the voices of many on this forum are more supportive and helpful than any psychiatrist and psychologist. I DO acknowledge - disclaimer time - that some specific issues do require individual counseling.)  Or perhaps we can have a guide stickied to this sub? Input from all of us, the advice we want to remember."
howtonotgiveafuck,2z00lj,TheDamnBoyWonder,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"It's been several days since I responded to this most excellent post so I have trouble remembering what I had in mind! I'm old but not old enough for this to be a legit excuse.  I just re-read your post and found it flawless. I have lived what you describe. For the first 50 years of my life, I managed to be the most miserable person I knew of.   When I turned 50, I deliberately decided to cease all efforts at self-improvement. Most of these efforts were devoted to conquering social phobias I'd had since early childhood. So I decided never to force myself to interact with people if I didn't feel like it. In fact, I became a hermit!  I've lived as a hermit for almost 5 years now though I do see people on a regular basis. The only folks I know in the State in which I reside are my landlord and the lady at the Post Office since they don't deliver where I live so I need a PO Box.   Strangely, it was only when I decided to stop fiddling with myself and deliberately decided to accept myself as is, spots and all, that huge and real improvements started taking place without effort or even expectation on my part. The results are still spinning out and lately I've not only learned to love myself (something younger me would've considered as likely as learning to fly like an eagle). I even like other people!  A year ago, some Jehovah's Witnesses came by. Although I am not susceptible to their belief system, I now invite them in and serve them tea and cookies each time they risk their lives to navigate the mountain to come see me. They are serious and sincere people and so I'm willing to talk to them about whatever interests them. They aren't what is usually referred to as friends, but they are pleasant company nonetheless. And now my fear of others of my kind is gone. Completely. And I am amazed.  I have learned that I only live in the present and if I am to be happy it is now or never.  Humans these days, and maybe for centuries past, are programmed to want to become something better than they are. This entails a constant tension between what one is and what one would like to be and this tension can ruin all possibility of enjoyment in the present (or ever since enjoyment takes place exclusively in the present). This wastes life in the most horrifying way for no damn good reason.  We do not learn from beating ourselves up it turns out! We learn when we are happy with how things are now. Unbelievable but true - at least in my case.  Your post is outstanding and of the greatest importance for human beings at this time. I believe that we are living in the Epoch of the Great Bewilderment. Our kind no longer has any idea what to want, what to believe and what to be. This massive bafflement engulfs every aspect of our lives, both personally and publicly, and makes us unable to function in beneficial ways.   Your post addresses this problem brilliantly and I'm very grateful to have come across it. Please keep preaching the 5-year rule. Our young are so confused these days that many don't even want to live. This is understandable considering the world we have created for them. We must all do whatever we can to change this."

Five years ago I thought you could get a job, any job, with a STEM bachelors degree, fantastic references, and killer work experience (I'm a co-author on three papers). Now, after nearly a year of unemployment following a brief desperation-driven stint in retail I'm back at it again, making $10.25/hr destroying my body in the lumber aisle at Home Depot and sleep on a pilates mat laid on the tile floor in my dad's home office. Five years is a long time. A very long time."
howtonotgiveafuck,2z00lj,dnew,2,Sun Mar 15 07:08:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be five years. And I'm not arguing five years isn't a longish time. It just feels like the right amount of time to me. I'm 38 F, and that's not an age that I feel particularly captures me (I feel both younger and older in different ways - especially: seem younger to others; feel older inside). By this age I'm giving five years a VERY different outlook to I did when I was in my 20s, where five years seemed like a VERY long time. To me, now, it seems like not long enough. You start to worry about making a difference in your life, the world, whatever gets you going as you age - and I now feel like five years can pass very quickly and uselessly if I'm not careful.   Ten years ago, I'd: - Published two books. They still sell (textbooks: human development, workplace bullying) to schools and companies across the world, but bring in very little royalties. Being a writer sucks. - Joined up with a comedy team called The Chaser, which had a TV show and website here in Australia. They were like our version of The Onion. I was very excited when I got the job at 24 - I'm being paid to be funny, satirical - and after a year... they ""forgot"" to pay me and the other contributing authors and let us go as the TV show took off. Worse, a few article submissions that were ""rejected"" appeared on their show when it first started. I felt sick. This was utter, specific theft. Welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. Being a writer sucks. - Five years ago I was still a finance journalist and sub-editor and writing stories about the GFC for a well-paying, steady job, with my work occasionally appearing in Australian newspapers (The Herald Sun etc). I wrote about trading psychology, a topic I found interesting. Then the company went under and the very thing I was writing about (shocking unemployment statistics) became my reality, not a story I was writing about. Being a writer sucks. - Signing up at our welfare office! That was fun. Being treated like a criminal is awesome. Being a writer sucks.   But I'd still argue that, after all this crap (including losing my job which meant losing my identity, losing hope in the writing/journalism industry, youthful promise dangled in front of me and taken away) that I'm doing better now. I wasn't for a while, but now I am. Because I know things will change, even while I'm earning a quarter of what I used to earn doing something I don't like. (New industry choice; new outlook; new people.)  Five years is arguably not so long, I admit (this is controversial) to people who are unmarried. I decided to remain unmarried and never wanted to have children. It was a decision I made when I was little, and I've never wavered in that thinking. So, in choosing not to have kids and not do my bit about passing on my awesome genetic code, I do feel that my time is more my own and I should use it better. I think people who are married with children find five years to be a very long time - children are incredibly taxing and life-altering, and I know five years can feel like twenty life times to parents. (It did to my parents. And me. I was the oldest of five kids. I remember my childhood being a constant cycle of nappies and new babies to be carried around on my hip. Most of my childhood photos show me in this light.)   So people can choose the time span. It's supposed to be more reflective of being a bit older, knowing a bit more what you want. I think people are realizing this later and later in life. How much do we really know about ourselves when we first leave school? I ran off and got a degree without really thinking about it. No one told me the world was going to change and my career choice would be obsolete. It was the awesomest career choice to me (come on, writers, ""awesome"" is a word and you can accept it or not - give me a fellow wink to let me know you understand, huh?) and it was my passion and my life. It still is, in a way, and I can say that no person has hurt me as much as ""writing"" has.   But I got over it. You're clearly incredibly intelligent. A MAJOR life-career letdown this is going to almost kill you. Almost killed me. I rarely mention to people I meet now about my former career. When I hear, ""You published books?!"" (the person has seen my resume or heard reference to the books from someone else, such as the web) I say, ""they're hardly inspiring. Don't buy them."" (They're alright, but I'm not too happy with my editor at the time. It's more that I assign them to my past.)   And I hope in five years time (age 42) I'm smarter and happier again. My choices will help decide this, though I acknowledge circumstance will throw wind onto a lot of my choices. If I'm still alive and aware of who finally sits on The Iron Throne (I'm going with the obvious choice of Daenerys) and laughing about something, I'll probably consider myself successful.   I laugh more than I used to. I notice more than I used to. Today for the first time ever I saw a fully intact fox. It was dead on the side of the road, on its side, eyes still open, back legs lying on top of each other and giving way to smooth-skinned stomach. It reminded me of the way my dog sleeps. I've never seen a fox before in my city. It saddened me that it was dead. It surprised me that we even have foxes.   Five years ago I doubt I would have noticed the fox, though. I don't know. That's important, that I did notice it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2z0x4j,EnvyDemon,5,Sat Mar 14 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"Guilt is a hard thing to deal with if you're not experienced with it. I used to (and still do, to some degree) put the feelings of others before mine, and even stayed in a relationship with a girl for far, far longer than I should have because I was afraid to hurt her (she was a wonderful person, but I just no longer had genuine interest). The way I deal with that type of guilt is just reminding myself over and over that letting guilt guide your decisions is just a surefire way for someone to get hurt much worse later on. It's not perfect, but it's an exercise you can practice and get better at. Also remind yourself that guilt will only make you a worse person; you will make decisions that seem right at the time but are hurtful to others in the long-term. There's really no magic bullet for not feeling guilty (in my experience). You just have to remember to repeat the downsides of guilt to yourself and let time do its work. What you should never, never, NEVER do is turn to substances (especially alcohol and other depressants; weed can be helpful for the right person), as the come-down will only perpetuate the guilty feelings  and keep your from properly processing your emotions.

howtonotgiveafuck,2z0x4j,Bekazzled,2,Sat Mar 14 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"It's really, really hard when you have to dump someone and you can't think of a major reason. If you were in the same boat that I was once (and i admit I've had several different major relationships, each different) it can feel almost criminal, hurting someone ""for no reason"". However, there was a reason - probably reasons - why you ended it. It can take years to even guess at what those reasons are (were).  In my situation, after I initiated the break-up, my ex and I broke off contact for a while and even though I was guilty, I didn't realize until later to what extent he was suffering immediately afterwards. I felt horrible. I also continued to feel that we weren't the right fit. I noticed one of the girls from my ex's photography course was hanging around a bit more. I remembered thinking when we were together that he was a bit attracted to her. I hoped they'd get together. They did. I was relieved. I felt guilty about being relieved.  So, SHE will be fine. You will be fine. The guilt part is annoying, but it shows you have a conscience. It's annoying, I know. But it keeps you from turning into a major arsehole.   In terms of How To Not Give A Fuck, don't go back to sleeping with her, don't let her feel that you've broken her heart forever. You haven't. People don't die of heartbreak. The swooning, near-death illness of broken hearts is the stuff of Jane Austen. People adjust. (Even in Jane Austen.) That sounds harsh now, but they do.   Also, as you get older, I find you get less guilty. The promise of reduced guilt in your future has to be one reason to keep going, right? (You'll know more about what you want. You'll realize your decisions weren't meant to be painful, they were smart. You won't realize how you are suddenly feeling less guilty and more in control, it'll happen organically. And you'll feel oh so relieved.)"

What's important is to catch yourself on those feelings and stop dwelling on them. I was in your situation for almost a year and still partially am - been in a relationship with a girl who is unable to function in life without my support and guidance.  What is important to realize is that you have your own life, you can't fix or build life for other person if you don't want it.   And that is okay. Things happen.

howtonotgiveafuck,2yyebc,Tasva,2,Wed Mar 18 14:17:28 2015 UTC,"One way of NGAF is to recognize the game for what it is, and to step out of it even if it's just with one foot. Some would call the fisherman lazy, some would call him successful; Some would call the industrialist succesful, some would call him stupid. The game is the result of a failure to recognize the process as the goal.  It's like a tired man pushing a bed in front of himself trying to reach the goal so that he can rest comfortably. Only at certain arbitrary checkpoints does he stop to rest, and when he wakes up he has a new checkpoint in mind. If the man walks past someone resting on a bed he may try to convince them that it is way more peaceful over there at the next checkpoint, and soon you have a caravan of people who've made perpetual dissatisfaction their purpose in life. It's like a form of OCD; It's a barrier that reappears as soon as it is broken down, and which separates you from unconditional contentedness in the present moment.  The short animation Life and Music perfectly describes the situation."

howtonotgiveafuck,2yvybf,Hello_McSwiggans,4,Fri Mar 13 07:15:51 2015 UTC,"So good!  Really reminds me of the ""Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. I'm currently listening to the audiobook and it's totally hitting me where I need it.  About how both the past and future are both vying for our attention trying to make it seem as if they're real. But they're not. They're illusions. The only moment that's ever existed is right now.   The NOW is the only time that ever was and ever is.   It's really encouraging to hear you're realizing all of this on your own."

There are a few different ways to deal with these kind of thought patterns but I'll give you the one that's helped me the most. It's important to be mindful of your thoughts. When a self-judging thought comes up like ""I suck,"" acknowledge what it is- a false thought. Don't try to push it out of your mind or shut it up- just let it hang out but understand that it's not true. Remember you can't really control your thoughts but you can control your behavior. Meditation is an important part of this method because it makes you more keenly aware of your moment to moment mental life. Good luck and always remember just because you feel like you're inferior doesn't make it true."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ynxtd,Gambit791,3,Wed Mar 11 22:36:51 2015 UTC,"OP--/u/shycakes offers a great piece of advice above. While your age and the inevitable changes we all experience will have some play on this, the key is self-awareness. There is, within each of us, a part of our minds that is intended to protect and preserve us, to spur us on to greater things. It is an Inner Critic. It is that little voice that tells you that you can do better.   However, that portion of our mind can become hyperactive and hypersensitive. Instead of encouraging us to correct our shortcomings, it belittles us and discourages us. Instead of saying, ""You can do better"" it says, ""You suck; don't even try. You will always be this way and there is nothing you can do about it.""  It becomes a judge, being overly harsh of ourselves so we never venture out and take risks to improve.   As /u/shycakes said: the way to combat those thoughts is to recognize them and reject them. It takes time, patience, and practice. You will gradually grow more keenly aware of those thoughts and thus more capable at rejecting them. In time, they will decrease in their frequency and severity.  Good luck to you!"

What we don't see is the unpolished, unedited, no sound track, no special effects or sound effects version which is right under the skin.  Don't get upset at yourself for being different.  An orange isn't supposed to look or taste like an apple.  If you're genuinely impressed with a specific person, become friends with them.  Get to know them, personally.  Find out what makes them who they are, and in the same process allow yourself time to find out who you are.  If they don't think you're 'cool' or worth time of day, guess what, there are like 6.99 billion people more on this earth to try and get to know.  Fuck the haters.  Don't worry about emulating another person's life, their director's cut of the presentation of their life.  Don't emulate somebody for their face value.  Emulate somebody because of the strength in their core.  Especially at your age, everyone is still figuring it all out.  Hell, even at my age (30) we're still figuring it out.  Food for thought."

It is the feeling of inferiority that does this. And this feeling of inferiority comes about for just one reason: we judge ourselves and measure ourselves, not against our own “norm” or “par” but against some other individuals 'norm.’   You are not ‘inferior.' You are not ‘superior.' You are simply ‘You.' ‘You' as a personality are not in competition with any other personality simply because there is not another person on the face of the earth like you, or in particular class. You are an individual. You are unique.”    Read it! I've also recently started a subreddit encouraging one another to discover our identities and pursue our passions at /r/BeingBold.

When you let others decide how you feel, you will feel even worse due to the lack of self control that brings. When you let others decide how you feel about yourself, it's the worst.   Control your caring. When you feel inferior, ask yourself why it matters if you are, if you truly are, what the deficiencies of others are, what battles they must be fighting.

In the first one he says "" what we mean is that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn't care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble.""  In the 2nd he says ""And there’s an elderly lady screaming at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her 30-cent coupon. Why does this lady give a fuck? It’s just 30 cents."" Well, I’ll tell you why. That old lady probably doesn’t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons all morning. ""  So in the first he got pissed and reacted that he was going to do whatever to ruin that guys life. His words. Then he tears down the old lady for ""ruining"" the cashier guys day because he wouldn't accept the stores $.30 coupon, which she thought was an important, noble, right thing to happen.  So I guess it's about perception. Should he have given a fuck about the old lady yelling at the check boy? Should she have given a fuck that they wouldn't take her coupon? Should the cashier given a fuck that he is working a job where an old lady can yell ay him at his place of business in front of all the customers?  Who should or should not have given a fuck in this scenario. If none of them, isn't that being indifferent. All of them?"

So I guess he'd say the old lady was doing the fuckgiving that was left to her.  Maybe after the cashier had grown into his not giving a fuck some more, he'd just take the coupon, make up the difference, and not get yelled at.  If he'd really miss the 30 cents, it's for him to decide how much of a fuck he gave about shortchanging someone drunk who'd never miss it."

Surely the lady at the grocery store didn't. She was standing up for what she decided was important. Regardless of if it was the $.30 savings or whatever. He makes it sound like she has nothing better to do then yell at the cashier. She was probably GAF about saving money as she is on a limited fixed income and every penny she saves is very important to her.  Anyway, I was just trying to gain some perspective from the article.

HTNGAF is a lot like that Alcoholics Anonymous prayer; improve what you can control, don't give a fuck about what you can't, and know yourself enough to know which is which. Don't give a fuck about your sleep apnea. That's not something you can control, it's gremlins in your face eating your breath or whatever (I'm clearly not a doctor). Your weight? That's... kinda in between. You're twenty-five, shits gonna slow down. You aren't playing soccer or polo or whatever the hell it is that you Aussies do when you're not keeping dingos from eating your babies. You aren't growing six cm a year anymore either. You're slowing down and you're gonna put on some weight; it's not that big of a deal. Yeah, don't let it be too much, but again, don't let it consume you. Those guys from 300? They worked out six hours a day everyday for five months so they could look like psychotic underwear models. The guy who plays Thor? He said he can barely wipe his ass when he bulks up that much. Real people aren't athletes, and athletes drop dead all the time  On to serious shit. You're gonna die. I'm gonna die. Civilizations die. Stars die. Entropy will always increase to maximum. It is basic thermodynamics and an immutable law of reality. Nothing you can do will ever change that.  So fuck it, why worry?

Extremely tall women tend to have long features because, well, they are long everywhere. But it's all proportional. In your case your body comes across as very feminine as well, despite the height.1  Your true challenge is not being ugly. At all. Your true challenge is being insanely tall for a woman.  Here is my theory.  Most guys below 6'3""-6'4"" won't even try to approach you. Heck, in most cases, guys below 6'6"" will have a hard time approaching. If you consider that the average male height is 5'9"" (slowly shifting towards 5'10"" at most), I suspect not many guys have made you feel pretty. So you obsess over small asymmetries or the length of your face, when they are absolutely non-issues.  My suggestion would be to start approaching guys, even if they are shorter than you (unless you don't like them because of their height, which is fine). You might discover that quite a few guys find you attractive.  </unsolicited-advice>   I'm not hitting on you. I'm happily married.

I too have a roman nose but oddly, I have actually found myself attracted to women with similar features as myself, including the roman nose, so while our physical features do play a roll in our attractiveness, so does personal preferences. Furthermore, you can call bullshit on this all you want but I personally find that personality does in fact either add or subtract to a persons attractiveness.

I have been going through a tough time for the past few months and a few nights ago, I found out my girlfriend was cheating on me and is now engaged. It completely pushed me off the edge and I feel very similar to how you described the feeling of constant anger and sadness. I hope I have an epiphany soon too."
howtonotgiveafuck,2xu3hr,FrenchToastGhost,5,Wed Mar 4 04:39:41 2015 UTC,"Good. I'm glad you found at least a chin up outta that. It's not about the epiphany, though, it's about the follow up. Where you take it is up to you"

howtonotgiveafuck,2xu3hr,tubercular,2,Wed Mar 4 08:59:50 2015 UTC,"It may not seem like it, but the loss of the relationship will be easier for you to drop from your list of fucks given. It was for me anyways.  On the other hand, I still have my moments when it comes to my family, especially my cousin. The question, ""Why?"" will never truly be answered, and in the end, stops meaning anything.   Still, we trudge on."
howtonotgiveafuck,2xu3hr,vrmptns01,2,Wed Mar 4 13:25:44 2015 UTC,"ngaf is knowing when to hold them and when to fold them. I understand that it's healthy to vent rage and anger. Bottling it up is much worse and unhealthy. Being calm, stoic and resolute draws more attention than blowing up at people. Because these days, people expect anger when they try to piss you off and when you dgaf they're like ""wtf?""   NGAF is just one technique in this fucked up world we live in."

I learned that the opposite was true. I've had a significantly better response from people, even romantically, since I've become more stone faced. I notice my words are much more deliberate, they hold significant weight.   Funny thing is, all of that doesn't even touch the reason this happened to me. I needed a change in perspective.

My family gets mad at me for saying I don't like him or his mother (my uncle's wife) but I know they don't either.

If you KNOW you have that much influence on a kid but still shake your head and say ""They're going to end up in prison due to me being the only one who can actually get them to not act like a prick, what a damn shame"" then you're the one failing the kid."

howtonotgiveafuck,2xppef,gixel,9,Mon Mar 2 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"The last step is to give no fucks about occasionally giving fucks. Like you said, full circle.  You will always give some fucks. You must be sure that they're the right fucks to give, and make peace with that.  It sounds like this relationship stuff is a reasonable thing to give at least a few little fucks about. So, accept you give those fucks, don't give a fuck that you give those fucks, and allow those fucks as long as they don't stand in the way of you living your life.  If it comes to this, be okay with talking out your fucks with the girl you're in drama with. Be open to discussing them honestly and nonjudgmentally. A good, straightforward, honest talk goes a long way towards putting fucks to rest.  And don't try for eternal happiness. Happiness is by its very nature transitory. Consider eternal satisfaction, a state of being fully sated and craving neither change nor consistency, as a more worthwhile, attainable pursuit."

He was not the inventor of the incandescent light bulb, but rather the guy who industrialized it. The invention was actually quite old when Edison started finding the right materials for the filament that was going to be his new long-burning bulb. He also created the whole environment around the use of the bulb, from sockets to wires, to power plants.   Then he went to Wall Street to sell it to the rich 1%, that ruled the world at that time, because he knew that they had what he wanted; money.  His DC power system was shit, but he was not bright enough to know. Nicolas Tesla said that AC power was better, but Edison tried anything to disprove that. He actually invented the electric chair to prove that AC power was deadly, and therefore the inferior technology of DC power should be chosen as a national standard. (he obviously failed in the end)   tl;dr: Edison did not give a fuck."

That's why I have some more fun facts:  Before they used the electric chair on humans, they went around New York and collected stray dogs to be used as test subject. They even electrocuted cows and horses.   After they had executed the first person with AC power, Nicolas Tesla wanted to disproved the deadlyness. He made a display where he dressed in chained body armour, increased the voltage and the frequency, and ""electrocuted"" himself. Because of the frequency, the power never really penetrated the armor, but the sparks went flying from his armour, so he was not harmed in any way. This showed that AC was safe within certain conditions, and AC was chosen as the standard.   60 Hz AC power is by no means safe, but it is easier to manufacture and transport than DC."

Seems like just a nice compliment, but one day I actually reflected on it. How did I end up, I guess, fashionable enough to warrant more than one person making a comment on it?   I realized that it wasn't an overnight thing. I didn't just wake up one day and become color-coordinated and not dressed like... a college student, basically.   This was a slow, gradual process. It was a change from baggy jeans and graphic tees to clothes that fit better and were more flattering overall due to an accumulation of different articles of clothing and shoes and accessories until I was able to put together enough different, good outfits that people began to notice.   The phrase ""fake it 'til you make it"" applies in pretty much everything you will ever do in life.   When I bought my first pair of not-goddamn-all-black-New-Balances, was I fashionable? No, but I was pretending like I was. I had taken a step forward. I had made a conscious decision to move forward.   Did I immediately go out and buy a whole new wardrobe and burn my old one? No, because that would be not only incredibly impractical, but also be a drastic change to how I express myself that would probably have left me feeling uncomfortable even in my own skin.   ... now, after my long-windedness I'm gonna tie back into the main point. Thanks for sticking with me so far. Here's a picture of a sloth who thinks he's cereal. Silly sloth, you are not cereal.   If you wish to NGAF, it begins with a step. You can't, and shouldn't, just get up one day and... stop letting little things get to you. But you can try.   You might find yourself with a little bit of road rage. Catch yourself. Does it feel good to be this angry at something you cannot change? Do you wish you didn't feel this way? Savor that thought process.   You might see something disagreeable on social media. Do you feel terribly tempted to get in the last word? Maybe sway them to your side? Or... is it really just not even worth your time? These are questions you must ask yourself.   There are little moments which, if you can notice and not let them pass you by, may make a change on your larger behavior patterns. Habits build. Compound interest. Initial small investments can end up having big payoffs, if you can devote the time, however small it is, to maintaining.   I hope this helps and I wasn't just rambling. I had fun."

If you're thinking about doing something and have the typical self doubt and are overthinking it time and time again, get over it. Get over it because yes there's a chance you're going to feel awkward or embarrassed about change and stepping out of your comfort zone but take it in stride. If you do, just a small bump in the road towards figuring out what works, what you like, what you don't. Find yourself in that awkward or embarrassing moment? Learn to laugh it off, be light about this kind of thing. Don't make things or situations bigger than life itself. Living in fear of what others think is crippling life itself and is no way to live. You become a product of what others want you to be rather than what you want to be. So do what you really want to do.

howtonotgiveafuck,2xcqzn,PhorTwenT,2,Sat Feb 28 00:36:30 2015 UTC,"I usually use pretty good quality coffee, the best I've tried was an Intelligentsia Espresso roast. My family was lucky to be gifted some good coffee from some random smaller companies so I've been using that mostly. Cold brew will definitely bring out more flavor from a coffee so you will definitely notice a difference using a better brand. You can get a lot of interesting tastes from different roasts as well. Light roasts tend to be in the fruitier, more acidic side. I tried a bottled cold brew that was like this, and while I could see how some would like it, I thought it was nasty. Medium to dark roast is definitely my go to."

howtonotgiveafuck,2xbtnv,ellisjc2,6,Fri Feb 27 06:39:17 2015 UTC,"This is a long story but it really means a lot to me. It taught me a huge life lesson. Sorry for the wall of text, but I'd really appreciate an honest read:)  So I rock climb a lot. I did it competitively for the first 4 years that I was climbing. Long story short, my coach opened up his own gym and made a new team structure.   Basically there was an A and a B team. I was the newest climber on the team, the only one to not make it to nationals but just as passionate as everyone else.   Ever since I started climbing I climbed with my best friend. We always climbed together and rarely ever went without each other. She was always much better than I was.   My coaches decided I wasn't good enough to be on the A team and put me on the team with 12 and 14 year olds (I was barely 18 at the time). All of my friends trained on different days and I was with people I had never climbed before and who just joined.  Not only did I feel left out, but I didn't feel good enough. I didn't feel good enough to be on the A team, I didn't feel good enough to talk to the people that were once my best friends, I didn't feel good enough for my coach (who was now also my boss at this point since I picked up a job there as well).   For a long ass time I hated the thing that once made me most happy because I just felt judged every time I did it. I spent most of my days obsessing over what my coaches thought of me and if they thought I was trying hard enough to bump me up. I was living for them.  I don't remember what it took for me to not give a shit anymore. But I just stopped climbing for them. I climbed because I wanted to and I tried as hard as I wanted to. I placed where I wanted to place and competitions and didn't give a shit about what they thought about it. Eventually I started having fun again and I started loving to climb. They eventually made me a sort of unofficial ""team captain"" of the B team because I was motivating everyone else.  We had a clinic with a climbing professional celebrity dude. He was best friend with my coach/boss. It was an amazing experience. He taught us so much about mentality when it comes to the sport. And he ended up taking a liking to me. He asked me why I wasn't on the A team and if I was a team leader. He told me that I was the most passionate climber out of everyone on the team, both A and B. It was kind of a good feeling hearing that from a professional I had just met.  After he left, my coach/boss called me into his office. He told me that I was doing something he never thought he would do when he made his business plan for the team. He decided to move me up to the A team mid season. I remember walking out of his office and hugging all of my old and new friends. Everyone was happy for me and no one was bitter that I was leaving the B team.   Long story short, I found my passion again. I got myself out of the thoughts that I wasn't good enough for other people. I stopped giving a shit about something that in the end, was just a title. I opened the flood gates and things came my way. I got what I wanted the best way I could have gotten it. And it probably sounds stupid to most people but I think it was a huge change in my life and it taught me so much. It definitely made me grow as a person and taught me why I climb and why I do the things that I do.   TL;DR: advanced from a ""B"" team to an ""A"" team after realizing I needed to be there for myself and not in order to impress my coaches or earn a title. Things started flowing my way once I let go of not feeling good enough."

I'm 30 so I'm sure that doesn't help.  Among other things I'm trying to work on, after spending most of my life only half-engaged with the world, just rearranging my apartment and figuring out better ways to use my space and spend my time takes everything out of me.  Sometimes I get so stressed with all the deliberate thought it takes to make the changes and maintain them, and the dissatisfaction with the slow pace, which regularly crops up, that I shut down and just have to watch TV for a few hours.  EDIT: I just realized how this is related to the topic probably isn't obvious.  I think that the family you grow up goes a long ways in shaping your ""comfort zone"", and breaking those mental habits is the change I'm talking about, and it's just hard.  I know that making a drastic break always backfires, so we're trying the long slog approach."

howtonotgiveafuck,2xbtnv,CapraRose,4,Mon Mar 9 04:08:12 2015 UTC,"Help me:  I was fired because of an issue between reality and perception.   Someone was stealing supplies at my company, my coworkers knew I was experiencing financial hardship and under a lot of stress. When questioned in a round about way about the items that went missing I was extremely anxious (because I have social anxiety morons!) and they took that as evidence of guilt. I did not steal anything but I'm having trouble forgiving myself for not proving my innocence.  I'm worried that I work in a small industry so word will get around and I'll never be able to get employed in my field again. All because I was perceived to be guilty of theft when in reality I was under stress and anxious.  The worst part is I feel guilty!! The fact that they even thought I stole something tears me up inside. It just hurts! I'm trying so hard to NGAF what they think and my support network is telling me I shouldn't feel this way but I do. This has crippled my self-esteem and my sense of self-worth."
howtonotgiveafuck,2xbtnv,danielskoven,6,Fri Feb 27 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm sorry my friend, that you are stuck in a place where people have grown sharp elbows, and undeterred ignore you're true value as a human being. It seems like many workplaces are like that nowadays and it calls evermore for realizing how silly it is. You are worth more and i hope you realize that fully, now or at some point along the road. It is hard but do not despair. My sister calls me at least twice a month, extremely sad about her really tough job at the ministry of justice. She is moving forward in a visible steady pace. Sometimes one step back, then some forward etc.  When my sister was finally called in for the dreaded conversation with her boss and told that shes is not working efficiently and well enough a nice little fuse blew in her head. She finally decided then and there ""who the hell is this person to dictate how i feel, this makes no sense"" - and then, from just feeling that she was entitled to more hapiness she became more happy and stopped letting him hurt her - for some time. She still works there. We are working together on her low self-esteem and we will go travel together soon. To be with buddhist and beggars and assholes and antropologists. Because, personally, the more i realize that all the things that i take seriously, a lot of people around the world really give only a fraction of a fuck about - if that. And that is nice. Because I am reminded that my values and beliefs are completely arbitrary, shaped by my culture and society and could have been anything. I could have been a zen monk or a neo nazi depending on where i had grown up.  So things so seriously? Because everyone else does! I'm just a human guy, affected by what my friends do. It's hard not to. The key is to surround myself with nicer people who know just as well as me that the meaning of life is up for grabs and that means fuck identifying with my workplace which in turn means not getting so sad when the identity built around it is under attack. TLDR: Maybe you are now one step closer to letting go. Simply because you get tired of letting some arbitrary thing, not chosen by you, dictate whether you should be happy or not. Thats crazy no? Anyway, for what it's worth I love you. Take care of youre precious mind."
howtonotgiveafuck,2xbtnv,thejaytheory,2,Sat Feb 28 21:40:55 2015 UTC,Very good advice. Particularly with regards to the workplace. Sometimes I feel like people think I'm not doing good enough even though I work crazy hard. And I hare having to potentially explain myself when things don't get done exactly like they want. I get defensive anticipating that possibility. It consumes my mind way more than it should.

howtonotgiveafuck,2x8o4k,Marley217,11,Fri Feb 27 02:23:03 2015 UTC,"Very good message. Time for my story: This last december my ex-gf broke up with me after having been in a relationship with her for 8 years. We lived together for more than 4 years, and had a pretty healthy and good relationship. My own personal social life was almost non-existent however. I had very serious social anxieties which had me in an almost constant state of fear. Even though I had no anxiety with her, the prospect of social situations did give me anxiety. When she broke up with me, I had finally hit rock bottom, and was forced to work on my fears. Because of this, I've made incredible progress these past few months, and I feel human again. I do things with friends almost on a daily base, and I've even discussed my very personal fears with them. I've also completely changed my lifestyle where I follow a structured and rigorous exercising schedule and diet. And I'm not lying when I say I'm not trying improve myself to get more girls. I'm doing it simply for the act of self improvement, I don't even care that much about the final results, but feeling like you're actually improving yourself, in this moment, is one of the most important aspects to being happy. As far as my own happiness goes, I'm happier than I've ever been. Even though I'm a poor-ass student that hasn't had Any romantic interactions for the past 3-4 months. Having a gf would of course be nice, but she would have to be pretty freaking amazing for me to make such a big change to my life."

howtonotgiveafuck,2x8o4k,Marley217,2,Fri Feb 27 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"You're going to feel like shit and it's going to hurt for a while. Let the pain happen and cry if you have to- your brain will need the time and the anguish to process what the fuck happened to you.   Six months on her breaking up with me still hurts a little but less so- she was awful for me, held me back, and was making me a shittier, lazier person. I don't need that in my life, and I guess the pain I feel is now regret that I wasted a twelfth of my life on someone who didn't deserve a twelfth of one of my seconds. I miss the companionship but at some point I'm going to find someone who jives with me, or not, and that's okay too."

howtonotgiveafuck,2x8o4k,Oochiethrow,7,Fri Feb 27 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"What was it that you changed when you hit rock bottom?   My big mistake is that I allowed her and the future we talked about to become my purpose in life, so losing her meant losing a great deal of my future plans and identity. I was left with a broken heart and anxiety about the future I now had to scramble to plan for. The most immediate thing is that I had to seriously rethink who the hell I was and what I wanted after two years of trying to give everything to someone who, in retrospect, treated me like shit and took everything I did for her for granted. Significantly even her best friend former friend was telling her that she was a terrible person for how she treated me (Seriously- it was bad enough that girl code was broken and her friend called her out on her shit).   So, if I might make a list of how I changed (because I love lists):   1.) My level of tolerance for bullshit evaporated and I stopped giving a fuck.  2.) I reconnected with some of my earlier plans from when I was younger that I had to give up to be with her. Now I'm planning a move to Oregon with a friend once I'm back in the States like I always wanted to.   3.) I cut out all the useless shit in my life like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube that I spent hours of my life wasting time on. In the first month after cutting this shit out I read about five or six actual books.   4.) I had to be reintroduced to the reality of solitude and loneliness and relearn how to be alone with myself all over again, whereas before I always had her to talk to.   5.) I rejected the temptation to try to drink or eat the pain away and numb myself by forcing myself to exercise more and up my protein/healthy fat intake; this jacked my testosterone and has made me more aggressive in the sense that I'm more focused and present-focused- my level of comfort with myself has stabilized significantly.   6.) I'm definitely much quieter if only because I'm not always opening my mouth to try and get people to validate me like I used to; the positive of this is that people are drawn to me because I actually listen to them and tell them how I actually feel about their situation without bullshitting them.   7.) Related to #2 and #6: I'm writing a lot more now and I feel much more inspired to write. While I've become more quiet in conversations it's like my mental energy has shifted to writing more poetry and long-winded thoughts (which no one ever sees).   8.) I don't sleep very well any more. Having slept in the same bed with someone (not talking about sex- actual sleep) on a pretty regular basis sleeping alone is one of the loneliest places you can be. I miss the physical closeness of spooning someone.  9.) After the breakup I swore I wasn't going to get back into porn or masturbation, and I've kept to it. The downside is that I am horny all the time, constantly to the point where it's almost hilarious. At twenty-two I shouldn't have random erections every time I see someone attractive, but it's like I'm fourteen all over again. Sometimes my erections have even been somewhat purple because of how hard I can actually get. Not really a positive to this- it's a huge distraction and I feel bad for the next girl I have sex with- there's going to be a lot of pent up sexual frustration, among other things, that she's going to have to deal with."
howtonotgiveafuck,2x8o4k,Marley217,3,Fri Feb 27 15:55:37 2015 UTC,"4.) I had to be reintroduced to the reality of solitude and loneliness and relearn how to be alone with myself all over again, whereas before I always had her to talk to.   I'm going through the same thing right now. I've had some progress in the fact that I'm taking way better care of myself, exercising, and trying to find healthy routines. I also started taking care of my apartment. I don't want to live in a messy bachelor pad anymore. So I started buying shit like couch pillows, rugs, air freshners etc.   I need to work on being social a lot more. Having casual conversations with random people everyday is slowly helping.   One major thing for me that I need to fix is drinking. I get so tempted to drink when I'm feeling depressed. Its a major turn off for myself. Do you have any tips for getting motivated to work out? I feel like if I had more motivation I would do it a lot more and not feel tempted to drink."

I used to be able to lay around all day but now I get figgity if I sit for too long.   As far as motivation to start working out nothing will really help until you just force yourself to go to the gym and start lifting. Even if you initially lack the motivation and feel awkward at the gym, once you start seeing the veins pop up on your arms and the fat get shredded off of you you'll have all the motivation you need to keep going."

Atleast for the first single months that is. I also stopped fapping, and I pretty much had exactly what you had. It got to the point where I was slightly desperate of finding a woman to have sex with, so I would just randomly talk to a lot of girls because of that. But being kinda desperate for sex really isn't the way you can start a healthy relationship. I started fapping again (not everyday!) and I feel very normal again, it's really easy for me to connect to people/girls in a non-sexual manner now. But, moving it with a friend sounds like a very good idea to me. After the breakup I started hanging with my male friends a lot. And I do think it's really important for men connect with other men.    The loneliness is by far the hardest part isn't it? But the loneliness did force me to leave to house and face my social phobia. So keep on using that drive to leave the house, keep exercising and monitoring your diet.     If you're in the mood for a good loving evening, I suggest you get a bunch of friends together, and take some MDMA (responsibly!). It's incredibly enlightening to talk about your (and your friend's) problems when you're both super open, and full of love."

Congratulations, you've passed the first test, but failed the second.

Disney movies might have put in your head that everyone gets a prince or princess, and grade school sports might have put in your head that you can get a trophy for ""participation,"" but these are not ways that reality works.

howtonotgiveafuck,2x8o4k,leftyB123,2,Thu Feb 26 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"Well said! At the start of last year something inside me just clicked and I felt like I woke up and realized that I had a lot of underlining work and exploration of myself before I could expect to join the rest of the world in a competent manner, as well as finding true ""conventional"" love...  Then I realized how few people actually do the same. So many people are afraid to get to know themselves for whatever reason. It's scary, the exploration of mind and body, fears and desires. But to really love and appreciate yourself you have to do it. Nobody else will love you and understand you quite so much as you can of yourself. You're free of judgement. Less likely to be surprised by your decisions and execute better ones.  Love and get to appreciate who you are down to every minute detail and you will never feel alone or out of place from the world. Once you achieve that, you won't care about finding someone that can make you feel validated or accepted; and once that happens, you'll attract people by the handfuls -- but you don't depend on them to live a happy and fruitful life, you already have the strongest understanding of self.  So many people die not really knowing themselves intimately. Only knowing of themselves from an outsider's perspective. It's really sad if you think about it.  It's easier to have an outsider provide the acknowledgement, though. Easier to dismiss and ignore, or separate the good from the bad."

As I stated, by itself wanting to be with somebody is fine- as a matter of fact, it's a normal human impulse. The problem is when you structure your life and your time worrying about wanting to be with somebody.   For the Stoics and Buddhists it's the notion that human suffering (in this case, anxiety and depression) is the result of being too attached to a person, idea, etc, the pain that happens when our expectations aren't met within our arbitrary, want-based time tables. For Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc) it's the notion that human suffering is the result of sin, which is primarily the result of wanting to be independent from God (with the exception of Eastern Orthodoxy, which sees suffering more in terms of ignorance) which is, at least roughly, compatible with the former.   Because of this, it is fair to say that most religions and philosophical systems agree, in one way or another, that suffering is primarily because people set themselves up to suffer- either because they expect something or they feel like they deserve something, and are subsequently distraught when life doesn't go their way."

What they looked like when they found me. That drove me not to do it. It filled me with this really horrible agonizing feeling. That I knew I didn't want to have to put them through. I've had help from a physicist and a doctor. I've tried different tests to figure what I'm supposed to do next and I'm on meds for depression. I just want a job. Not a good one. An honest one. A modest one. Where I will get paid what I make. I don't really care about money so much as only a means to an end. Like, starting a family. Or, buying an Xbox.

Many people don't need medicine, and it isn't an instant fix for anything, but it can help you get back into the right mindset -- get your mojo back -- so that you're able to function and do what you need to in order to keep healing and moving on and reaching your goals, and stop them when you're headed in the right direction again.

All the different meds affect different people differently; some people have to try 2-3 before finding the one that makes them feel best. There's SSRIs (Lexapro, Zoloft, etc), SNRIs (Cymbalta, Effexor, Prestiq), Benzos (Xanax, Ativan), MAOs, and Wellbutrin which is pretty unique to all the others.  They can take up to 4-6 weeks to fully function, and they don't magically change your thinking without some therapy too (but they should still make you feel calmer/stabler). You should discuss the different types of drugs with your psychiatrist (or whoever prescribed the Wellbutrin) so you can understand how they work and pick one that might help you better. Many of these are not dose-dependent (which means that more will not have more effect). I'm not a doctor so I'm not giving you medical advice or anything.  Just another person who's been to the lowest lows, suicidal, etc and Ativan and Prestiq seems to be the combination that's given me myself back and I did a lot of reading about the different meds lately haha"

You play an instrument? Hipster. You listen to anything beyond what's on the radio? Hipster. You like doing standup? Hipster. You try too hard to dress nicely? Hipster. You try too hard to not dress nicely? Hipster. Mustache? Hipster. Beard? Hipster. You wear a hat? Hipster. You claim to not be a hipster? Hipster. You claim you are a hipster? Hipster.  Point is, people will always try to reduce others to basic components, but rarely will try to actually understand others. So what the fuck does it truly matter? You'll always have haters around you, but you don't need to join in their negativity. Just because they cannot enjoy themselves does not mean you have to stop enjoying who you are as a result."

I ascribe those choices to personal preference and if other people have to label my choices as something other than my own decision then their opinions don't really matter to me. Hipster is an obnoxious word but I refuse to let it limit my choices. It reminds me of high school when people would call me goth because I wore black band tshirts all the time and liked spikey things. I loved metal and would not let labels keep me from my happiness.

How can nothing make you feel shitty?  In more practical advice for you, why not look up different standards of attractiveness over the years. Look up lip disking, Paul Rubens, and foot binding.

Attractiveness provides a valuable aspect of the halo effect to consider because of its multifaceted nature; attractiveness may be influenced by several specific traits. These perceptions of attractiveness may affect judgments tied to personality traits.""

And by resources I don't mean nice things.Buy books on law, computer programming, asset protection. Build a library to refer to when there is no one to help you. Keep money stashed away.

This works great going forward, but having fell victim to critics in the past, you'll need to work through prior criticism as well.

howtonotgiveafuck,2x0q6i,agent_of_entropy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 13:36:01 2015 UTC,":) here you go:   Sounds like you might have some post traumatic stress. Obviously, I'm not able to diagnose anyone over the internet (or irl, for that matter. I'm working on a PhD in theory of cognition, but that's different than being a clinical psychologist.) Anyway, your description sounds like you are a bit symptomatic for ptsd (e.g. significant distress and impaired cognitive function induced by an identifiable trigger that traces back to a particular set of distressing experiences, etc.) What I can tell over the internets is that what you're describing is an acute stress reaction.  So that's great news!   Why?  Because if that is what's happening, the first thing you can do is stop shaming yourself. It's your brain that's giving fucks, not you. You are perfectly reasonable, not at all shallow and in a good position to experience a real improvement in your quality of life. You simply have something that is analogous to a temporary allergy. You have a distress reaction when you are exposed to people whose physical appearance, for whatever reason, codes to ""mild to moderate danger"" for you.   Your brain has been programmed to perceive these situations as situations in which you are all of vulnerable, threatened and impotent.   I'm guessing that since you're aware of this being abnormal, you've probably already tried things like positive self-talk, etc. And these things probably didn't work, right? That would make sense, because things like that are effective in changing our propositional beliefs about the world. But if you are having a stress reaction induced by prior trauma, these tools aren't as effective. This is because you your reaction is less like failing a test due to not having studied and more like failing a test because you are having a seizure.   In other words, it's your brain, not your beliefs.  But, the things is, brains are plastic. That means that barring tissue damage or genetic issues, they can be rewired. But this requires intervention from a person who knows how brains are rigged up, aka, a doctor or a qualified therapist. She or he can determine whether you indeed have post-traumatic stress and if so, how best to treat it.

Try to focus on what you can offer the world that looks, class, or any type of social standing won't offer much of an advantage in. That's usually why we feel inferior in the area of attractiveness: we feel as though that attractive person may get that job, or that girl/guy over us simply because of looks. While there is some truth to this, it's not a 100% certainty. We all have something to offer if we focus on honing our given talents. In this way, you can learn to let go of that inferiority and become somewhat apathetic to this perceived disadvantage."

They were sitting on the toilet pale and sweating with something foul gushing out their backside like the Old Faithful geyser. And if it was really bad, they may have had to hop up as soon as they finished that and turned around , forced to drop their faces near that nastiness only to have it come up the other end.   Imagine that and you'll see that they're really just like you.  They may cleanup a bit better, but they go through the same crap you do. The protagonist of all those romantic comedies that seems to have it together at all times just doesn't exist - we all get the stomach bug, we all suffer rejection and disappointment.

You might notice that good looking guys are the ones who look healty and confident. Good looking girls are the ones that would be good mothers (big hips to waist ratio, boobs).

howtonotgiveafuck,2wz5wv,thewrightstuff88,1 point,Fri Feb 27 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"Harold and Maude! It's my favourite movie. It's about a 20 year old guy (Harold) who falls in love with a carefree lady (Maude) who's about to turn 80, and she does not give a fuck - she shares her perspective candidly, asks questions, re-tells experiences and (what I love most) her attitude visibly rubs off on Harold throughout the movie in that he comes out of his shell and learns to live his life the way he wants to live it. Scenes where Harold DGAF include: when he fakes his own death multiple times to get out of having to go on dates with women he's not interested in; faking being a mentally unstable, blood-lusting freak who is not fit for duty in front of his war general uncle who wants to get him drafted into the army; when he destroys an expensive car his mother bought him after she got rid of his ""ghastly"" hearse car (he's seen driving a hearse for the rest of the film); the fact that he shakes it off in a very much fuck-it kind of way after his mother says ""you have got to kidding me"" after he tells her he's in love with Maude and he's going to marry her; that he says fuck-it after he approaches a priest whose reaction is extremely disgusted upon to finding out his desire to marry Maude (seen here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iZnQPLJi2t4). Now Maude's DGAF moments: when she sings If You Want To Sing, Sing Out spontaneously and encourages Harold to join (seen here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EKGze_1DWbE); when she steals a car, messes with a policeman who pulls her over, and makes an escape on the cop's motorcycle; that she does two things which are often looked down upon - has a romantic relationship with a guy much younger than her, and something else which is a spoiler but I'm sure is very controversial. It's a beautiful movie."

I think you're right on with the PTSD thing because it actually sounds something like EMDR therapy, which is used frequently in PTSD. I went through EMDR for severe anxiety after my therapist and I narrowed down a few events from my childhood that seemed to still be generating tons of anxiety. Basically, the process works by putting you back into the traumatic event and forcing you to experience all the negative feelings, then going through the event over and over and over until you can replace the anxiety with a more positive message about that event."

You can control how you react to your feelings. I like to think of my feelings as information. Just like hunger tells me I need to eat, feelings tell me whether something in my life is making me upset of happy. That's great if it's something I can change, but some stuff I get angry or sad about is beyond my control. So I have to understand that ""I'm feeling sad about x, but I can't do anything, so I'm just going to acknowledge my sadness and let it be."" To me not giving a fuck is being able to sit with your feelings. Sadness and anger become less destructive because you don't get tangled up in them."

That sort of pervasive microaggression contributes to the background insanity of our culture.  You're told you're supposed to not give a fuck about people putting your life in danger through carelessness or aggression, and just accept that people are bad drivers.  We're expected not to give a fuck about the rampant corruption and hostility of a system that treats you like a commodity to be used up until broken and then discarded, when not too long ago it would have been unconscionable for the workers of a mill not to own the mill.  Wage slavery is slavery, and it's powerfully displayed in a tips-based position.  Not only is a server underpaid through bullshit laws, but now you are vulnerable to every asshole you have to be subservient to.  It is not a right or natural state of affairs.  ""Not giving a fuck"" isn't just about not giving any fucks, it's about giving the right fucks for you, not the fucks people tell you that you should or should not give.  It sounds like you had an authentic moment and acted on it.  There's a measure of personal power shown there, knowing that you can tell them ""You need me, man, I don't need you."""

I agree -- look out for yourself, because no one else is guaranteed to -- but also be decent to others.  If being a responsible adult is now categorized as ""pervasive microagression"" then consider me a microaggressor."
howtonotgiveafuck,2woija,talanton,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking my comment personally when it clearly was not intended as such.  I said people were offering their advice for their own reasons, and those reasons varied.  In this case, from the little details afforded, this leaving ""suddenly"" does not appear to be sudden at all.  It sounds like it is coming after a long period of dealing with ""bullshit"" and is not exactly surprising.  Likewise the fact that she is being approached by her employer with the employer asking her to give them a second chance shows the nature of the situation.  In general, I'd agree with you - it is compassionate and correct to consider your impact on the people around you.  Failure to do so would be a contributing factor to what I described as ""pervasive microaggression"" and conscientiousness is clearly not.  I am not advocating looking out for only yourself and hurting others, that is clear from the tone of my entire comment.  It is that trend in society in which people are treated as means to an end and not an end unto themselves that violates the categorical imperative and contributes to a hostile and sick system.  What I am saying is that system itself is owed no allegiance.  If, out of her concern for her coworkers, she decided she wanted to put in two weeks and train her replacement, that would be her choice of fucks to give and would be right.  But if it would be out of concern for the place of employment that is apparently not concerned about her, or out of fear for future prospects?  It's right to not give a fuck about those.  Give the right fucks, and realize that only you can decide what those are.  In my experience, what matters in this life is our connections to other people.  Every moment has value, if you're present to notice it.  Even the shitty ones in traffic where you gain perspective about what you value and how you'd prefer not to be. :)"

I'm actually considering teaching English to supplement my move to Asia, although I know of an open position doing stenography in Japan.  Unfortunately, it requires a certification I have yet to obtain, but it's a goal of mine to get it before I make my next move.  If I end up teaching English and not utilizing it, at least I will have it if and when I move back to the States.

I don't know why this has always appealed to me; a sense of freedom maybe? It just seems so liberating not being bound down by social norms.   If you're heading down towards LA be sure to stop in Santa Barbara. More specifically State Street or the wharf. These are both great places to play -- there are always other performers in this area.   There is this street performer who plays on State in one of the parking structures. He sets up his little 10w amp and plays simply beautifully. The way his music echoes through the parking structure is something amazing to hear. His sound will travel all the way down the street.

I did that. I even got to tour a lot with major label artists in nice, big comfy buses. I had a modest amount of success in the music biz for a while, based out of Nashville.   I'd spent my whole life since I was a teenager to get to the point I'm at, and I'm becoming ever more successful as an instrumentalist. Still on my way up.Then I got tired of it. Always being gone. I'd bought a house. I was never home. I was on the tail end of my mid-30's.   I totally remember the night it all changed. I was on my way to get on a bus at the Brentwood Kroger at midnight on a Monday.   The whole way there I remember thinking to myself ""damn, I don't wanna get on that bus."" I didn't enjoy it any more. ""Why? I don't know. Maybe I just need a little break.""  The next 5 days out would be the last that I really spent in the music biz.   I started working for a photographer that I'd worked for on and off for a long time. Pretty soon I just started my own photography biz. I got married (at 38) and bought a beautiful farm about 30 miles south of Nashville.   Still work for myself. I've started a couple other businesses as well, plus I fart around horse-trading various things.   Life is good. Not once have I ever wanted to get back into the music biz. Not even to play a couple local gigs a month or something. Not even for fun. It stopped being fun.   I really hope that you get to do all those things, too."

When I was a young adult starting out there was no internet. There was no HNTGAF philosophy. I didn't buy into a philosophy that I stumbled upon. I simply didn't GAF. Ever.   I started out very poor with a box of clothes and some meager posessions, a $500 van, and a really shitty studio apartment in a horrible neighborhood.   You know what? Aside from my lovely and talented Farmwife, who is a blessing every day, I was just as happy then.  I was just as happy at 17 and hopelessly poor as I am at 44 and, frankly, well-off.  I just did what I wanted to do. Sometimes you do what you have to do to get by. That's life. If you just mostly do what you want to do, you'll find that life has a way of taking care of itself.

I'm honored that I could share the thing you needed.  You get all sorts of advice from friends or teachers or the creepy people at the bus stop who want to spit in your mouth for a sexual reason, but all they really say is some tripe like ""relax, man"" or ""don't take things so seriously"" or ""just open your mouth for a minute"" but without the context.  Maybe the context can't really be taught or explained, I don't really know. Maybe you just have to hit the point of emotional exhaustion where you can't give a fuck because there simply are no fucks to give. But just maybe, you can tell a story about your breakthrough and it'll somehow resonate. Maybe you can help that one guy.  Or maybe I'm making far too much of your casual word choice, who knows?"

howtonotgiveafuck,2wiz9q,ohsnapt,2,Fri Feb 20 07:30:24 2015 UTC,"What's the problem? It's February... unless you're doing Trimesters somewhere the term has only just now started, so... you're not boned at all.   Talk to the offending teacher/professor. Let them know you're conserned about the thing. Ask them what else you can do. Do an outline and have them check it. Do every step and have them check it first. Because there's a secret in the world in General and academia in particular: you get points for trying. I've met one person in my whole life who got pissed off at you for trying harder after you fucked up, and everyone in the company agrees he's an irredeemable asshole.  Finally, let me tell you a story. I worked hard and got ahead and school came easy to me. I was nearly done with my undergrad when a wild course appeared! To graduate in the honor's program, you had to do a research project. Mine couldn't be done. I don't mean it was really really hard, I mean that the schools stats program couldn't handle the quarter of a million data points I needed it to. So I worked hard and preservers and you know what? I fucking failed, because the project was broken and my adviser didn't notice or care. AND I had satisfied that requirement earlier and just fucking forgot. Woohoo for me.  So I graduated the following semester in the fall. It affected my GPA by .12 points. Still with honors, still with the honors program. It felt like the end of the goddamn world and I spiraled into a mild case of alcoholism and depression for a bit. Now, I'm engaged, planning a trip to iceland and making $60k a year at a job that doesn't even require a degree.  You'll be okay, my friend"

To me it also looks like you like to compare to other people, try to compare yourself to yourself from yesterday.  Just my 2 cents. Sorry if my advise sucks."
howtonotgiveafuck,2wh0gu,gta-man,5,Thu Feb 19 23:32:53 2015 UTC,"Deleting Facebook allowed me tops focus on my long-term goals and not care about today's constant need to be social and to interact with friends on a hourly basis.  My dad, who I would say is a very successful person, became so by giving his whole body and mind to his ideas. That means cutting relationships, however difficult it may be, with people who diverge your mind from your aspirations.  I've come to realise that Facebooks and other social medias force you to stay social with old friends but in life, friends are supposed to come and go and you should thrive to develop bonds with people who inspire you and who you respect. My high school friends are not my friends anymore because we've gone different paths in life but I imagine that if I was still on social media, I'd feel pressured to interact with them, meet them, go to parties with them, etc."
howtonotgiveafuck,2wh0gu,prussm,3,Fri Feb 20 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"What you've described, at least in my experience, is the life of being an introvert. How do you best recharge after a long day? Would you rather curl up with a good book or maybe a video game, or to party with your friends? That's usually the queue of whether you're an introvert or extrovert right there.   A book I recently picked up, ""Quiet"", discusses the experience of being an introvert and coming to terms with the fact that it's completely fine and normal to not want to be a social butterfly every hour of every day. It may give you some solace, and perhaps some tools to deal with these situations as well.   The key is to understand your core self, and to not deny that person the freedom to express those fundamental behaviours and feelings. Sometimes that'll mean politely excusing yourself from social gatherings- even before they start. Most people will understand."
howtonotgiveafuck,2wh0gu,TalontheKiller,2,Sat Feb 21 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"I totally relate to everything you just said. I'm in my thirties now, and for most of my adult life I forced myself to be social in ways that people expected me to but I wasn't really comfortable with. Go out, go to parties, have parties, often drink to loosen up even though I don't enjoy drinking. Eventually I just stated telling people how it is. I'd be polite but say sorry, I'm not going to come to your event because I just get overwhelmed around too many people. I try to socialize now on my own terms - have a few people over for dinner and do things I'm comfortable with. What's interesting is that quite a few people have confessed to felling the same and told me they prefer small groups too. If you open up with your friends you might just find the same. Also, seek out people who feel the same - I'm very lucky to have just married another introvert, so neither of us feels the need to pressure the other to be the life of the party. I hope that helps."

howtonotgiveafuck,2we80z,benjaminbrooks,11,Thu Feb 19 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"The Buddhists might help you here.  To paraphrase The Matrix: Don't try not to feel, that is impossible. Instead, realize that everything is temporary and attachments to people, to feelings, to possessions, causes suffering because everything succumbs to decay and  death. This allows you to feel appreciation for what exists now, and to try to improve that which is in your power, not for any personal gain but because you want to do what you can in your limited time.  Reading about the Eight-fold Path really helped me change my mindset so I could NGAF about things."
howtonotgiveafuck,2we80z,mens_libertina,7,Thu Feb 19 12:01:18 2015 UTC,NGAF is nothing to do with NGAF about yourself. That's completely the opposite of it. The whole point is not letting everything and everyone else affect your ability to feel good about yourself.

Just to add if it helps, I think about the amount of energy I have to care about things as a bottle of liquid energy. Each time I choose to care I have to pour out an amount commiserate to the situation. It helps me evaluate whether or not I want to pour out over a given situation or save it for something that might take a lot of my energy. Usually I like to have as much left as possible at the end of the day."

My 2 cents: you can't live life truly DGAF. You should GAF about some things.    Your friends.  Your family.  Your health.  Your happiness. Anyone or anything that depends on you to survive.  etc.   The trick is to NGAF about things that don't really matter. Each person needs to take some time to reasonably decide what matters and what doesn't. And then they should orient their lives to focus on what matters.    For example, my brother places a higher value on family than me. In his mid-20's, he's a newlywed with a suburban house and two cats, and he wants to be a doting father and husband. He lives to be a family man. He DGAFs about how he pays the bills.  Whereas I'm very career-oriented and ambitious. When I'm not wasting time on Reddit or sleeping, I'm researching and/or working on projects. A relationship would be a distraction from my work. I (try to) live for my work. I DGAF about marriage or kids.  Two very different orientations, but both perfectly legit."

You're doing great up to the point where you said something aloud. There's NGAF, and then there's being a jerk. You should care enough about people insofar as being respectful to them.  Truly NGAF would enable you to stab people and not care about their feelings, but this sub obviously isn't advocating that. You should GAF to the point of being decent to other people. Unless those people wronged you first, you shouldn't be wronging them. Telling people to fuck off is wronging them.

It's a tool of virtue ethics to posit a virtuous agent, against whom you measure actions. Much like the bonus pater familias of Roman law. So first off, nothing wrong with external influence (people say otherwise, but, you know, dgaf). I bet people have different ways of going about these things anyways.  I'd say that Bertrand Russell is a really good example of someone who didn't give a fuck. He was of course very active in the anti war movement, and wrote his famous political essays. But he didn't give a fuck. He wasn't trying to please anyone, or get anywhere; he was making his arguments because they mattered to him - and he was damn good at it.  If you got the time, and can live with it being a bit dated (although still relevant!), I'd recommend reading 'In Praise of Idleness' or other short essays by him. See how he mocks established norms, turn issues on their heads and posit all kinds of ballsy assumptions."

The comment was made with the intention of being read. Now that it has been read, and has been received poorly judging by the downvotes, the poster is back-rationalizing on the original decision, albeit in a mocking victim-identifying tone.  You can not give a fuck AND use your newfound levity to uplift yourself and others, or you can use it for a more defensive, apathetic approach to things. The path of fortification is two-fold: yes, you do receive fewer arrows to the chest; however, your heart is guarded by stone walls and will only be reached by those who choose to smash through your front gates.  In each situation, keep what is positive and throw away all the rest."

It's not that they're malicious people - it's just that deep down maybe they need that group validation, and for every person who does what's right instead of what's easy they have to face that they could, too.

I pay $170 rent each week, fill up the car once or twice a week ($30-50), then I have food and stuff to buy as well. Then every 3 months I have the car registration, electricity bill as well as an $80 phone bill once a month + the $20 that goes to charity each month and then $30 monthly for a membership to my football team. I'm probably living above my means but at the moment I'm coping. This was one of the big things I was worried about previously, now it's just as though it doesn't matter.

howtonotgiveafuck,2v3pb3,menewrando,18,Sat Feb 7 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"I used to frequently visit and post in /r/getmotivated, go to the gym, run for miles, and have a well paying job. But then the company I worked for went bankrupt and the type of work I did started to boom in Canada. Suddenly when things were out of control, I realized that all the motivational bullshit in /r/getmotivated wasn't giving me any answers. The words like ""success"",""failure"", and ""goal"" suddenly lost all meaning. The ""work hard and you will be on top of the world"" mentality became irritating. I had to pay bills, and being able to bench extra 45lbs wasn't helping me solve that problem. I quit the gym, traded my c-class for something cheaper, and got a shitty studio in Hollywood. Did I have a ""goal"" of living like a student who just moved to LA, absolutely not. But I was running out of choices. Am I chasing after SUCCESS? No, I need to make money to pay bills and my credit cards. I had a lot of free time while being on Unemployment, so I picked up my old DSLR and started shooting flowers and other random stuff. This is where “If you aren’t failing, you aren’t trying” kind of fits, but it's also is pretty meaningless. The phrase doesn't tell what to do, it equivalent of ""Just Do it!"" but do what? Be successful?   As I started doing photography I eventually upgraded to shooting bands, got better equipment. And after shooting over 20-30K photographs, I eventually started to get paid for it. It wasn't anything I could support myself with, but my work has gotten me to the point of making some tip money.   So I guess I had to ""fail"" 20-30 thousand times before I got good. But it's not failure. It's called learning. You fail when you fuck up and you have to go all the way back to start from scratch. But this time you try something different. You fail by having sex with a hooker and get and STD. Not because you didn't win gold at curling or you skipped a leg day."
howtonotgiveafuck,2v3pb3,yuribotcake,2,Sun Feb 8 02:36:06 2015 UTC,"But it's not failure. It's called learning.   need to remind myself of this daily. you're right about chasing society's ideas of ""success"" and ""goals"". honestly it's pointless and rather boring. i think you find more fulfillment in failing and learning and failing and learning and failing again.  there is no result, only process.  you should be goddamn proud of yourself dude. most people don't have the guts to take those kinds of chances and do something they love.  it's never too late."
howtonotgiveafuck,2v3pb3,owlephante,2,Sat Feb 14 22:54:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude. As for most people, they tend to dwell over their choices or lack of choices. This is why I like this sub, it's about people learning to give less shits about the things that stress them out. Worrying or stressing over things never leads to anything, it just stops you from getting enough sleep. I still stress like any other person, don't get me wrong. But if I have time to stress over something, that means I can fill that time with something. So I take my camera and go take pictures of stupid shit like flowers and buildings."
howtonotgiveafuck,2v3pb3,yuribotcake,9,Sun Feb 15 00:06:04 2015 UTC,I think that not giving a fuck about goals is an admirable goal.
howtonotgiveafuck,2v3pb3,hypoppa,3,Sat Feb 7 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"Just remember to still have goals, but keep them contained in what you can control.    i.e. I have a goal to stop fearing what others percieve in me, to stop masking my speech and actions around peers so that I may maintain my innumerable ""good relationships"" with others; I hate the idea of being disliked or rejected, in any situation.  My goal is to not wear those masks and to be me, and I may lose some of my ""friends"" because they don't like who I truly am, but that is good because I can then focus more on those who actually care for the real me.  Rejection will come but I need to come to terms with how natural that is, and how unhealthy it is to avoid situations where I may be disliked or rejected.  I also want to become more assertive, more confrontational.  I work as a Certified Trainer at a well known resteraunt chain.  I am very proficient at the training portion of my position, as well as the duties of the positions I train in (as a CT I still work the position I train for most of the time, only training when someone new joins our team.).  However when it comes to holding people accountable for their actions or calling someone out when they perform their duties incorrectly or not-to-standard, I lock up.  I would rather let it slide and deal with the consequences myself (or slip in and fix the issue before consequences arise) for fear that the person who I should call out would like me less or come to hate me.  Lately I have began to improve upon my assertiveness as a trainer, while maintaining my composure and kindness, and the reaction was very suprising for me.  My team has begun to respect me as their leader, my managers trust me with more responsibility, and I still remain on good terms with my coworkers (if not better terms).    If I didn't set these goals for myself, goals that I can control the outcome to through actions and thoughts of my own, I wouldn't have grown in the ways I have.  So goals are still important, it just depends on what kind of goal you set.    To be honest, it was this subreddit that motivated me to set these goals.  I read one of the sidebar links, and in some portion of the webpage it said ""Fear is just a neurotransmitter"".  That 5 letter sentence did so much for me.  I was crippled by this chemical in my brain, and upon reading that I have found more and more strength to stand against it and looking back over these past dew months, it has done so much good for me.  That was a bit longer of a comment than I planned on typing... oh well."

That's rejection after someone has gotten to intimately know you. It's them saying, ""I know who you are and I choose not to be with you.""

howtonotgiveafuck,2v0odf,thejaytheory,9,Sat Feb 7 01:08:11 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way, everyone has a story. We keep people in our lives because their story is both relatable and new to us. Every single story has a lesson to teach the reader, and every reader has a different lesson to take from it. She was not rejecting you, she just feels she has learned what was important to her at the time and now has other lessons to learn. Just because she has different questions and different needs does not mean she is rejecting who you are. You had a place in her life for a reason, the fact that you don't have a purpose in her life now does not mean that you once didn't. If you both were the same person as when you guys first met you then you guys would still be together.   Thinking this way helped me a bit after I went through a hard break up.

howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,fight_collector,91,Fri Feb 6 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"Well done, sir.  You'd love the Roman statesman and Stoic philosopher Cato the Younger. He used to purposely dress out of style, going against the fashion trends of his day, under dressing against the elements despite his social status in order to get people to mock and scorn him. He did this to inoculate himself against embarrassment and humiliation. From Plutarch:   Seeing the lightest and gayest purple was then most in fashion, he would always wear that which was the nearest black; and he would often go out of doors, after his morning meal, without either shoes or tunic; not that he sought vain-glory from such novelties, but he would accustom himself to be ashamed only of what deserves shame, and to despise all other sorts of disgrace.   In fact, you might find great value in Stoic philosophy as a whole. It's the philosophy of distinguishing the worthwhile from the worthless and then learning how not to give a fuck about the worthless :)  Edit: added Plutarch quote"

Stoics treat things like good health and prosperity as preferential but ultimately indifferent because their acquisition isn't fully in our control. Good health is preferable to poor health therefore you should behave in a way to preserve and enforce your good health. Avoid getting hit by cars, enjoy a clean diet, get lots of rest, etc. But if despite your best precautions sickness or accident strikes, a Stoic will say ""this is nothing to me"" and proceed to NGAF."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,cjnlion,51,Fri Feb 6 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"This does not sound like the correct choice in my opinion. This sounds like a very impulsive, not thought out action to take. I'm confused about why you had to shave your head and eyebrows. If you truly felt that is doesn't matter what you look like, why did you change how you looked before you went outside? Shaving your head and eyebrows changes nothing about you on the inside.   You need to figure out why you were scared to go out in the first place and address those problems. You shouldn't always just say yeah I don't give a fuck. You should give a fuck about how you feel about yourself, and if you truly want to help yourself you need to ask yourself why you really shaved your hair and eyebrows."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,lazyman73125,19,Thu Feb 5 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. Choosing to shave one's head and eyebrows sounds like it is the result of externalizing your problems and coming up with a short-term solution. This could be a good move, if you take this opportunity to address the real issues causing your social anxieties. When your hair grows back, however, you'll still have these same anxieties, and you'll need to be prepared to face them."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,lazyman73125,0,Thu Feb 5 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We don't this persons full story. All I see is an anxious person saying they had trouble going outside and then they shaved their head and eyebrows and now they can go outside. So without knowing the full context, I don't think it's right to cheer this on.   If he went to any professional psychologist/therapist NO ONE would have told him to shave his head and eyebrows. They know how to handle social anxiety, and doing that is not going to help in the long run."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,DuncanDonutz,3,Fri Feb 6 00:06:46 2015 UTC,"But couldn't this be considered a form of desensitization, which is an acknowledged form of therapy?

He could have gone to a psychologist or at least a friend and came up with a plan to desensitize himself with social interactions.   If you have social anxiety you should desensitize yourself by first admitting you need help and talking with someone. And then put yourself in social interactions.  I hope I'm never told to shave my head and eyebrows by a psychologist to help with my social anxiety.   I'm just saying I'm unsure about his actions, and you're saying that what he did was good. I'm not a psychologist, are you? I didn't go to school for years learning about human psychology. But for anyone to say this was a good idea, and isn't a psychologist, you're not helping the situation."

This man is clearly trying to push himself into that attitude.  Shaving his head would cause some people to judge him. If he forces himself to be surrounded by poor opinions, it could desensitize him to their worthless opinions. It's not like when he grows his hair back he's going to suddenly become aware of others' opinions again.  Like you, I'm not a psychologist, so I can't attest to how effective this will be, but I do believe that it has potential and that you shouldn't claim it won't work just because a psychologist wouldn't recommend it."

You don't have to say what it is, but if it is something that you could possibly improve then you should try to fix that. Not because you want others to see how good you look, do it so you feel comfortable with yourself.  Back when I was really struggling with social anxiety and depression I made many mistakes that weren't thought out enough, and that I couldn't realize at the time were bad decisions. I just want to make sure you're taking the best steps you can take to feel more comfortable in public."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,lazyman73125,2,Fri Feb 6 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for looking out for me man, and I'm not 100 percent sure, i just feel ugly most of the time. Im a person thats stubborn to change, If i can take an easy way out I'll try. But the one thing i've learned about myself is being physically forced to change and adapt is the only way i will change for good. I lack patience, and a thick skin as well, so now i HAVE to wait for it to grow back. I HAVE to stop giving a fuck about what people think i look like. It may not be the best decision but I have to get over this, its seriously fucked my life up.  EDIT: it also gives me a huge shift in perspective about everything. I did this out of a need to rid myself of the feeling of ugly, and accept myself for whatever i look like. It was impulsive but fuck it. The guy who shaved his head after messing up his haircut and posted on here inspired me when he said ""its just hair, it'll grow back"" . that is true."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,ebai,3,Fri Feb 6 02:12:53 2015 UTC,"Have you tried anything else? I know that feeling of feeling ugly all the time. I mostly felt it when I was younger, anytime someone I didn't know tried to talk to me I would turn red, get all hot, start sweating, and then just mumble out enough words to not look like a complete idiot. I was put through a situation where I was forced to change, so I'm not very good at helping others who are trying to transition from an anxious mess into a somewhat comfortable person. I think it's different for everyone though. You need to find certain things from your life that drive you to make the change. And you need to challenge yourself, and embarrass yourself. And I guarantee you when you make it through this, and you overcome it you'll come out of it with a quality to yourself that is hard to achieve. I can already tell you have it, but you need to work on it.   “Anyone can face ease and success with confidence. It is the way we face trouble and misfortune that defines us.”   I don't know if I'm being of any help to you but I can truly relate to anyone who is struggling with this kind of thing.

That just made me a loser though. I think i was just raised by my parents to have low self esteem so its like a reprogramming thing. shaving my head was something i used to do in the summer a lot, i did that when i stopped using drugs. I guess it was a coping mechanism to start new. when my hair grows back ill definitely be more grateful of it haha, but i understand theres much more to change my mindset than shaving hair."

It will grow back.  This is a big, but ultimately temporary change.  Those were some of the arguments I gave myself before I shaved everything all off, and it ended up working out pretty well.  In the end, it wasn't about the hair so much as what I learned through the experience.  It definitely helped get me out of my comfort zone and change my perspective.    That was one, two years ago?

howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,AfraidToPost,1 point,Fri Feb 6 13:50:14 2015 UTC,"Well, OP seems hopeful that this was a good move.  I wish them the best!  Anxiety is difficult to get under control, so I don't see why we shouldn't encourage doing whatever helps without hurting others.  Some methods may be unconventional, but that doesn't mean they're bad.  My therapist was pretty surprised when I showed up with no hair, but after we talked she understood my reasons for making that decision.  We talked about why I did it, what it meant to me, and what I expected.  I'd say I had pretty good reasons, like OP.  Even being diagnosed bipolar, she didn't interpret it as being the beginning of an episode because it wasn't.  We discussed how it would be useful in a sort of ""exposure therapy"" way.  I was afraid that people were staring at me? Well now they were definitely staring. I went from wondering ""Did I do something wrong? Am I acting weird? Should I say something? Should I hold my body different?"" to ""Of course they're staring, I have a funky head right now"".  Took the pressure off of me and put it on my non-hair, which gave me more encouragement to spend more time outside and around people.  The hair was only a means to do so; once it grew back the attitude I had developed stuck around a lot longer.    Sure, I doubt she would ever say ""you should shave your head to address your social anxiety issues!"".  I doubt many patients would be comfortable with that approach when there are others.  But different things work for different people and for me, and perhaps for OP, it was the right decision.  If she had been worried and started telling me why it was a terrible idea, the outcome would have probably been different.  I would have freaked out and felt like I did something wrong and hid away from people even more.  I don't want to make OP feel that way.  Instead, she recognized that the decision had been made and that I should go forward in confidence with my choices.  I did, and it was a turning point in the right direction.    I don't know OP other than what they've posted here, so I don't know what's best for them.  I'm only offering an example of how it can work, and why.  I would encourage them to see a therapist if they are having severe social anxiety issues, maybe they could even talk through their experiment like I did with mine.  I think it's good that concerns are being brought up, but at the same time I don't think focusing on what could have gone wrong helps as much as working towards what can go right from here."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ux28l,jaypeejay,4,Fri Feb 6 23:21:20 2015 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from. I was forced to the position you put yourself in.  You see, more than a decade ago, I was a pretty insecure person starting my adult life. Then I started experiencing patchy hair loss. Got diagnosed and it was Alopecia Areata, an autoimmune disorder which causes patchy hair loss (think like vitiligo but instead of having patches of skin lose pigmentation, you have patches that have no hair at all, google for images). Here is a representative image: http://www.singaporedoc.com/images/stories/SingaporeDoc/alopecia%20areata.jpg  In a matter of a year, I lost 70% of my hair, my beard, my eyebrows, eyelashes, body hair, pubic hair, everything. I used to spend an hour making myself look good and now I looked hideous. Since the hair loss was not regular, even shaving it all would look bad because some places would have no hair and some other places would look like how shaven hair looks like.  I got a lot more insecure at first then started getting used to it because what can you do? Life has to go on. It was not a life threatening disease at least, only cosmetic.  I had to get used to the weird looks and I had to get accustomed to being ok with this.  I spent a year adjusting but since then my confidence grew on me. I had to fake it at first then it became innate. Now I don't care about it at all; never had a problem with women and my wife today says that she prefers me this way comparing me with my older healthier pictures. I wouldn't be very offended if she thought the reverse to be honest, she dated me, if she had a major problem with that she had the choice to not marry me. Anyhow.  Getting out of your comfort zone works, even if you are forced to do it, the body / mind adapts."

To make the most of it we have to consider what the important things in our life are and go after them,  everything else is of negligible importance"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,minadee1,31,Tue Feb 3 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"From Osho:  Life is goal-less... and that is the beauty of it! If there were a goal, things would not be so beautiful, because one day you would come to the very end, and then everything after that would be just boring. There would be repetition, repetition, repetition; the same monotonous state would continue – and life abhors monotony. It goes on creating new goals – because it has none. Once you attain to a certain state then life gives you another goal. The horizon goes on and on running in front of you; you never reach it, you are always on the way – always reaching, just reaching. And if you understand that, then the whole tension disappears, because the tension is to seek a goal, to arrive somewhere. Your Mind is continuously hankering for arrival, and life is a continuous departure and arrival again – but arriving just to depart once more. There is no finality to it. It is never perfect, and that’s its perfection.  It is a dynamic process, not a dead, static thing. Life is not stagnant – it is flowing and flowing... and there is no other shore. Once you understand this you start enjoying the journey itself. Each step is a goal, and there is no goal. This understanding, once it settles deep into your inner core, relaxes you. Then there is no tension because there is nowhere to go, so you cannot go astray. If there is a goal, there is the fear of going astray. If there is a goal, there is the fear of failure. You cannot be a failure! Life does not allow any failure. And because there is no goal you cannot be frustrated. If you feel frustrated it is because of your mental goal that you have imposed on life. By the time you have reached your goal, the life has left it... just a dead shell of the ideals and the goals remain – and you are frustrated again. The frustration is created by you."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,louisvilledw,2,Tue Feb 3 12:48:55 2015 UTC,"This speaks truth but... It requires so much let go that I'd fear to then become too passive, and not fulfilling my potential. I.e. becoming old and looking back thinking ""I regret. I could have done more"".  I realize this is the fear Osho was just explaining but it seemed to simply be part of who we are. Because we realize there is death, an end."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,LeCaptainInsano,1 point,Wed Feb 4 01:56:54 2015 UTC,"You act from your highest wisdom possible when you let go, so no need to worry about becoming passive.  The unfortunate thing (I find) is that you can't coax yourself into letting go... It kinda has to happen to you and within you, spontaneously. And then living through that."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,louisvilledw,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"I realize this is the fear Osho was just explaining but it seemed to simply be part of who we are. Because we realize there is death, an end.   Well, it really depends on what philosophy you follow.  In some philosophical systems, there is no death because there was no birth.  I know that sounds batshit to a person not acquainted with that way of thinking, but there you go.  It all comes down to who you think you are.  Like who you really are.  Not your job, or what your parents named you, or where you grew up.  But I'll stop :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,LeCaptainInsano,2,Wed Feb 4 11:28:50 2015 UTC,"I see our job as what we choose to do with most of our time, and how we contribute to the world. Not just to pay the bills, hence why I think it counts in the whole equation. And for the name, its not really the name but the persons that surround you. Parents, brother/sister, there is a human characteristic to stick with them and show them appreciation. And that one day we (and them) will be home. This affects how we think no?  Anyways, all this to say that I have a hard time letting go of the fact that we have only a certain amount of time. This drives me to do things, sometimes against my feelings because I dont want to be passive and let go too much.  I'll read up on Osho but is there other texts that can help explain what you mean?"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,louisvilledw,1 point,Wed Feb 4 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely; it is important to realize that your time is limited.  I practice Buddhism, in particular Zen; one of the principles is to know that all things change.    To start, I would recommend Thich Nhat Hanh's ""The Miracle of Mindfulness"".  He has become very mainstream in recent times, but that's because he explains things well.  Shunryu Suzuki's ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"" is good.  Or you could start reading (and rereading) the Tao Te Ching.    This helps explain the Buddhist's idea of impermanence: http://i.imgur.com/JMSiUb5.jpg"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,LeCaptainInsano,2,Wed Feb 4 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Really. I've downloaded the book (miracle of mindfulness). And started to put in practice. I am at  stage where I find I need balance in life. A way to channel my desires and my fears ,so to have a sense of well being.   Anyways. It helps. Practical advise to stay in the presence moment.

I guess that was when the preconceived expectations of my life became more important than how I actually conceived my life.  Just last weekend I was revived by these rainbow-hued tracers following my hand waving in my face. My room that used to seem like a prison told just straight up told me I needed to get out of it for a while because we some space to repair our relationship. The doorknob was a swirly smiley face inviting me to open it. I couldn't resist the temptation to live. I'm still amazed that I have limbs. You guys should be too.   What I'm trying to say is, if you really feel like you can't stop giving a fuck about toxic shit: TAKE PSYCHEDELICS. They might make you a little out of it for a while afterwards, but that is just because they so bluntly show you the truth about what you've been doing with your life. But if you don't get hung up on your fuck ups, they'll fix you in the mindset of not giving a fuck."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ulnvr,PirateOwl,2,Wed Feb 4 14:25:53 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. For me, I need to remind myself when I start analyzing things unnecessarily that whatever my focus is does not matter at all. I would say 99% of the time this is true and when I recognize it I shift my focus to something more beneficial.  An example would be on the train. Is that person looking at me? Who cares, go back to meditating/enjoying music. Every time I do this I'm always happier that I'm not focusing on something frivolous and nonexistent.  But it can be hard. It's a mental muscle, the NGAF muscle. It requires training and exercise to work properly, and more importantly become habit. That's what I need to work on.  Thanks for bringing this up =)"

I don't feel like they've ever benefitted me in any way. I'll just text and email people, and otherwise spend my time reading and working. I'm tired of wasting my time"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ue4z2,FinibusBonorum,5,Sun Feb 1 08:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much in your camp. Also ditched Facebook and Twitter a long time ago but still check same other sites nearly daily.   Online stuff wastes way too much time, yet it's hard to just walk away from. Here and there I'll find a nugget of gold, a needle in a haystack. I tell myself this justifies the rest but it really doesn't.   My advice (fully aware that it's night impossible) is to do as you suggest - delete your online accounts, leave the virtual world behind. Go into the real world of people you can touch, and build better relationships with them.   Because - and don't take this personal - the online world isn't going to miss you, or even notice you're gone. Most won't even know you were ever here.

howtonotgiveafuck,2ue4z2,Stev02112,2,Mon Feb 2 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"I have a chrome extension I use called 'simple blocker' and it does exactly what it says on the tin. Throw reddit, instagram, twitter or whatever other sites you check compulsively on the block list, and throw the switch. There's no time limit/ enforcement, you just turn it off and on thru the extension icon. So maybe try that, leave it blocking the sites until you consciously want to check them, then throw it back on again.   You also can't really go wrong deleting everything, many 'social media' sites will gladly keep all of your personal information for marketing purposes; making it easy to come back if you like after an extended break. Subreddits can be resubscribed to and whatnot.   Another thing I've started doing which you may enjoy is reading books in my freetime. I got a kindle for christmas and take it with me around campus, and I'll read a few pages in the 10-15 minutes between classes instead of messing around on my phone. I find having a separate device makes this more do-able for me, reading off my phone never jived for me. Books are long, and sometimes tedious to come back to repetitively, so I'm reading a fiction and a non fiction. When I'm tired of one (like a chapter just seems to be taking too long, or for whatever reason it is not grabbing me at the moment), I'll switch over to the other. Having the kindle makes this extremely easy to do as well."

I was ashamed of smoking for quite a while then. So I stopped buying smokes.  I also was active on numerous social networks, thanks to European decentralization. I understood that I do not connect with people any more, but stalk the shit out of people I ought to care because we have spent amazing time back in old days. Now we would have nothing to say. I didn't had a smartphone, but if I did, I would be damn sure to delete every social app and suspend my accounts.  Now with spare time, I read sci-fi books, listen to lectures and discussion on philosophy, watch documentaries while performing menial tasks.  I only have to stop wasting 15 minutes daily on youtube watching magnificent bastard with his crude jokes and calming voice. Also, reddit is a time pit.

Any small benefit you might claim as reason pales in comparison to the time we waste here, being online. As if ""online"" is desirable in and of itself.

The first time, I just had total overload, so I pulled the plug. Deleted the account, everything.   Then I discovered that I was no longer hearing from some folks that I cared about, so I got a new account just to stay in touch with those. Many got angry because I was there but didn't want to friend them. They didn't understand that the simple fact that they were present to tell me, meant that they were present enough to disqualify themselves from my narrow Facebook feed.   Then I discovered that the people I wanted to friend didn't really connect with me, it was one way mostly. So I thought fuck it and deleted my account again. Only a single person kept in touch through other means. We're still in touch.   The rest of them? I don't give a fuck. They don't either, clearly.   I've been clean for several years now.

What I did was picked up a hobby (playing bass) and learning music production. Sure I'm not amazing at it by any means, but it was an interest I had for awhile and decided to finally start learning it. It does help me disconnect and focus on something outside of daily life. I'm starting to love it more and more everyday, and seeing myself getting better and progressing is such a satisfying feeling. So my suggestion would be as simple as, just find a hobby, something that's interests you, even if you don't think it will grow into any. (e.g.) I always loved the way calligraphy looked and started doing it once and awhile, I fucking suck at it lol, but it always fun to see myself progressively get better whenever I do it every once and a while and plus it looks nice on cards! So that's my suggestion, just do stuff that interests you and don't expect to be good at it because suckin' at something is the first step to being sorta good at something. Hope this helps!"

Quit facebook: suspend the account and delete the apps. Change passwords to random generated ones to make it even harder to log in. Got rid of the smart watch. Installed a browser plugin that limits my social activities to 1 hour. After which it blocks them all for the day.  These were just mine, but you get the idea.

Don't give up your wishes/dreams/hobbies, I've seen what people are like without that spark in their lives, and it's pretty depressing.  They have a job, they support their families - but you can see this regretful look in their eyes whenever they talk about what they ""used to do.""    All I have to do is remember how joyless and mundane the lives were around the people I grew up with.  Smoking + doing drugs numbed them while they marched to joyless work nearly every day of the week.  No hobbies, no ups or downs in their lives, just steady greyness.  And then I remember that I wanted to be a Pokemon Trainer/Sailor Scout/Witch/Dragon/Hero when I was a kid and I have nurtured and protected that from the mundane world and I promise to not sell my dreams for momentary comfort or whatever bullshit people tell me I need to believe.

EDIT: So I actually read the article, and it's cool, but here's what I think about it.   The article is suggesting steps to enable you to not have to give a fuck because you surround yourself with people who won't give you shit and get rid of those who do.   That's not not giving a fuck. That's changing your environment so you don't have to give a fuck.   I feel like it's kind of contrary to the spirit of NGAF. Instead of doing and saying what you want and letting the wheat separate itself from the chaff, you're doing all that work beforehand, then telling yourself ""Okay. It's safe now. I can stop giving a fuck.""   When I reached the height of my NGAF, I lost some friends. People were pissed at me and they cut contact with me. I didn't care about them, because clearly they weren't true friends to begin with. My actual friends became closer to me.   This article is recommending the reverse course of action."

We are not just ""connected""- we are the same organism. We are a giant mycellium through time. Every person you see is a slice of You in this time slice. That butcher is you. That stripper is you. That cop is you. That kid is you. That bum is you. That bigshot is you. That asshole is you (and you're not so bad when you get to know you).

Five years after your death, only the people you have shared some hope with will remember you. Pushing the ngaf attitude further seems to me to Be being reckless with your smiles and needlessly cool to strangers, in order to give them encouragement to do the same.

He may have lost all of his limbs, which I admit is very unfortunate, but because of that, he is surrounded by loved ones, almost an endless supply of support, acceptance, and respect, many fans, and tremendous loving attention. Who wouldn't be happy with those things? Physically he is limited, but mentally he is living the life. Support, acceptance, and respect, are things we all strive for, and although his accident is tremendously unfortunate, it is not the worst thing in the world that society so lovingly embraced and accepted him, as he deserves.  The worst situation may be for those of us, who may not have any apparent physical limitations, but due to circumstances from our past, are struggling to live lives abundant in support, acceptance, respect, and warmth. We are measured against a higher and more vicious standard. We aren't obvious victims like someone with no limbs, but we may have more hidden mental decapitations...maybe from a broken home, the traumatic loss of a loved one, a hostile upbringing, etc.  I go on this aside because even though I feel like it should, watching him doesn't really inspire me. If anything it makes me feel more misunderstood and inadequate. I don't really expect support or sympathy for these feelings though. But he may. And maybe that's the problem?"
howtonotgiveafuck,2t1k4t,Phoenixed,7,Tue Jan 20 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I was just thinking about him today and here he is, posted.  I can bet the environment where he grew up was positive and supportive, which gave him a healthy self-esteem (SE). And SE is a vicious circle – the more you have, the more it increases and vice versa. If a person has defects, usually he is conscious about them and his SE drops. This in turn makes him twice as unattractive – not only because of defects but also because of self-pity. He gets negative feedback and the cycle continues.  However, if a person with defects has high SE, he becomes even more attractive than a defectless one. People see him not giving a fuck about his disabilities and think ""hey, this dude must have great personality, what a boss!"". He gets a lot positive reinforcement and his SE (and attractiveness) continues to grow.  So the moral is: for each Nick, there are several analogue persons who were early in childhood abandoned, avoided, discouraged, ridiculed and overall – raised into victim/defeatist mentality. They are basically doomed right from the start, while Nick got lucky (in the SE department). Not to take away anything from him, though."

howtonotgiveafuck,2t1k4t,nc_slater,4,Wed Jan 21 04:56:41 2015 UTC,"It's clear his mom wanted him, I was born to a mother who didn't want me and just saw me as an anchor to my dad's wallet which made me feel like I was just inherently wrong somehow all the time no matter what. I was planned but not wanted. My mom taught me to hate myself before I even had a concept of language. Eventually I realized my mom is a huge narcissist, an un-please-able monster who pinned her happiness to the actions of others.   I haven't spoken to my mom in 5 years and I'm at a similar level of being obnoxiously happy and ok with things. I don't need a loving mother to be happy any more then Nick Vujicic needs a hand to be happy. I don't think it's helpful to think that I can make someone happy or that someone else can make me happy. Happiness just occurs when time is spent doing something interesting or when it does happen with other people they're ones who share common goals and interests.   I moved to a new state with no support network or family and started a new life on my own. Friendship is about finding people you'll never dread getting stuck in traffic with. Love is about finding someone who's great company under duress in ~6 hour long internments in hospital waiting rooms because that's in everyone's future. I learned I can be happy when I'm in pain and scared and that being in pain or scared aren't free passes to treat people around you like garbage (my mom was always using her precious pain as an excuse).  Had Nick Vujicic been born to my mom, he would not have been surrounded by support, acceptance or respect. He would've been exposed to as many irritants as possible until he had a suitable allergy response then doped up on massive amounts of benadryl to keep him quiet and vulnerable.

I then started to really miss him and regret telling him i wont talk to him anymore (long story short i made a bit i a fool of myself, but thats okay). I got really sad to think i will never see him again or talk to him, but you know what? To have those feelings is okay. To move on from my past is okay. I dont know i what my future holds so i shouldn't worry. So i calmed myself down and now I'm okay. We need to master our minds not let our feelings dictate our bodies."

When I get home, I'm thinking about not-work stuff.  Emotions, now, I have to work at that, but I feel like I can control those somewhat. Or maybe that's your point?  That we can go ahead and think whatever, but instead our external behaviors, as an outcome of those thoughts, should be subject to our discretion."
howtonotgiveafuck,2stljq,RaulEnydmion,21,Sun Jan 18 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"But the I that is supposedly in control of the thoughts is itself just another thought, a persistent feedback-loop of awareness if you will.  The idea is to detach yourself, as in your idea of who and what you are, from anything that is related to control.  So in essence. Do you breathe all day long, or is breathing just happening where you feel yourself to be? Do you beat your heart all day long? Are you producing hormones and neurotransmitters? Are you thinking, or does the brain secrete thoughts and emotions like the pancreas secretes insulin? Which part of the nervous system are you in control of, and how do you control it? Where and by what mechanism do you influence its reaction to the environment?  If you are not doing these things with an active knowledge of how it is done, then why at all cling to the notion of control? Just let go, and feel that it can all work itself out in spontaneous creativity. Go along for the ride; Resistance is conflict, both inner and outer.  It's not that you can't control these things, or that these things are forcing you around, it's that you are these things.  You can't control them in the same way that you can't bite your own teeth; The thing that wants to control is the that that it wants to control.  A flower doesn't give a fuck about being in control, and yet it grows. It's not depressed, it's not anxious, it's not a vessel of hate. But it fucking loves sunlight and bees.  We don't think of the flower as controlling itself or its environment, becaues we see the flower as the (our) environment itself. In the same way that we do not think of a tidal wave being in control of itself, it is an expression of the motion of the ocean. In the same way, you're an expression of the motion of nature, the universe, or what you want to call it. Many of our perceived problems arise out of internal resistance to the spontaneous way in which nature wants to express itself through the human form. Just be it.  That's one key to the door of appropriate fucks."

If you've spent your entire life focusing on something other than humans, the frivolous niceties and petty bullshit people concern themselves with will probably mean very little to you. If anything Linus' strong personality is probably partly to blame for how far he has gotten. He forces his opinion on the world with the absolute faith that his way is the best way... That level of not giving a fuck is undeniable and has a real effect on others... He inspires the fuck out of me. He is the perfect example of someone who gives a shit about what is important (the kernel), but seriously does not give a fuck.   And on a side note, he's pretty fucking rich. 10s or 100s of millions of dollars can support you and a family for the rest of your life.

Simply a man of principle, also a person who manages a fairly sizable programming project in efficient way. A project that's quite critical nowadays.  for some people who don't know much about linux, Torvalds mostly manages linux source code, the core of linux based systems. It's the part that drives all the hardware, and does typical operating system level tasks, like networking, memory management, thread management, cpu scheduling, all that low level things.  His job nowadays is reviewing improvements and patches sent by various people and putting them into his copy of linux source code, which is used as de facto official linux source code. The submitted code is reviewed by some more trusted and well-seasoned linux devs first, to offload some work from him.  In linux development, Torvalds has a golden rule - if change in the operating system breaks user's program that used to work, blame goes to the operating system developer that broke it. At no point should user's apps be fixed because some change at operating system level broke them. That is a rule that he sticks to religiously.  He consistently bitches about code that violates this rule, putting various developers in their place. He is rude, but not personally - he is vocal about quality of people's work, but never offends anyone personally. He is also quick to point out some dubious code practices as well.  The unfortunate thing is that many people take entire situation backwards. Linus is a bit of a jerk with his painfully direct opions, but that doesn't make him great. He's just very knowledgeable about internals of linux and various low level coding things. Many people think instead that being an abrasive person will make you more skilled in IT field."

In the rest of the world though, there often are ""old boys clubs"" and other mechanics of excluding people (even talented people) who don't conform to an arbitrary standard that has nothing to do with merit.

Similarly, it's really important to notice who just says, ""Sorry, man,"" vs. who says, ""I'm sorry I can't make it. Can we do something else on another day?"" If people just turn down your invitation without letting you know that they still do want to see you, those aren't the thoughtful friends you are after, so toss 'em.

I had my revelation yesterday morning; there's this man that I like that I've been trying to see more of, and for the past three weeks I've tried to see him during the week for dinner, and every week he puts it off. The first week it was a work thing, the second week no response, and yesterday he has a cold. It made me achingly depressed because I liked him so much. And then I realized how many people I do this with: girls who are in trouble at work, guys that I talk to online or as patrons at my job, and the ones that I'm a big softy over because they're divorced and lonely and approaching middle age. I just want to cuddle them and tell them how cute they are and make them feel loved!! Which is a totally sweet reason, but at the same time, I make so many assumptions when I start to get attached. Namely, assuming that they'd 1) be receptive to that kind of thing, 2) they are looking for some sort of change in their current state, and 3) that they like me enough to want that type of thing from me instead of someone else. And I romanticize the thing and then get hurt when they don't conform to my unfounded expectations.  This is one place where I absolutely need to stop giving a fuck. It's completely illogical and unreasonable and silly of me. It's giving the little girl inside the reins instead of being an adult. So yeah. Lol.

As much as we want people we care about to pick up on our struggles and step up without us having to actually say something, the fact is that if you really want or need help you've got to straight-up ask for it. Be explicit about what you need. Really explicit. Demanding, even.  That said, looking out for #1 is a great attitude. There's nobody who'll spend more time with you than you for the rest of your life. If these schmucks can't hack it, cut em out of your brainscape with a real shiny scalpel. I like it.

Really, the only people I've figured out are consistently there are my parents, and they're truly awesome. But in the end, you're right; it's all me.

I do my best to spin hateful thoughts towards a more compassionate view. You said that hurt people only look out for themselves. You are hurt now yourself, and look at how you are responding; you are choosing to follow their path. Instead of being angry with these types of people, pity them. Imagine that their pain is so great, that they lack the ability to see the pain in others. We can't fix people, and while it may seem like doing the ""right"" thing means to put others before yourself, it is not going to lead you towards happiness.

howtonotgiveafuck,2sf0nq,mugen_is_here,14,Wed Jan 14 17:07:26 2015 UTC,"In my experience through a handful of both positive and negative long-term and short-term relationships, I've abided by a handful of different philosophies and principles. The ones that have stuck have come from some of the most simplest phrases and quotes. Sting's ""if you love somebody set them free"". You'll be miserable trying to get what you want out of someone if that thing you want isn't there. I also believe a positive relationship is one that consistently inspires and challenges you to be the best you can be on a daily basis. On rejection, I follow Gene Simmons' advice in his memoir ""Kiss and Makeup"", which says his success with women came down to basically two things. He never let himself put women on pedestals and live with a romanticized mindset that a woman was someone she wasnt. And 2, he was always a gentleman, but he wasn't afraid to take risks and get rejected. If rejected, he simply said ""she just didn't see it"" and moved on. things like that may be helpful, but the spectrums of human personality and emotion are too complex to have one simple answer for relationships. You just have to 1. Treat a potential love interest as a human, not a fantasy. 2. Always be a gentleman and don't do anything with the underlying agenda of receiving romantic affection in return."

All you can do is be yourself and be genuine. If you like somebody there's no guarantee they will like you back.

You don't love her for her, you love her for what she means to you. She's right to run away from this. It takes a certain level of psychological health to love someone in a more sincere way, and many (if not most) people don't have this. Meanwhile, cultural stereotypes about what love is make it easy to confuse the unhealthy, insincere kind with the healthy, sincere kind. Especially since the unhealthy kind is so intense and compelling -- but that intensity and compulsion is a sign that it's driven by a need rather than by an appreciation of the actual person.

howtonotgiveafuck,2sf0nq,Dtapped,4,Thu Jan 15 01:56:25 2015 UTC,"Stop seeking out your friends as a source of romantic interest. That is not how this works. Occasionally things can develop - but that is an exception not a rule.  Date with the intention of dating. Friends aren't there to fuck or fall in love with unless you set out like that from the beginning. Feelings can develop over time, but if you find yourself in a pattern then you have to look at the common denominator - you're mistaking friendship for reciprocal romantic interest.  All that said - we always fall in our love with our own perceptions of who another person is. We project what we want to see in that initial infatuation phase and oft times ignore warning signs about who they really are."
howtonotgiveafuck,2sf0nq,FA_Anarchist,2,Thu Jan 15 10:03:22 2015 UTC,"You words sound somewhat insensitive and rude to me. Or maybe there's some misunderstanding between what you actually wanted to say and what I understood.  I'm talking about coming out of the crush, to hold your self-esteem when you face ""rejection"". Let me see if I can clarify a few things.   Stop seeking out your friends as a source of romantic interest.   What do you mean exactly? This has two meanings I think. One is not to kindle feelings of romance, in which case:  Okay. Done. So from now on I'll seek out friends for the sake of..... friends? Yes I think I can do that.. Hey guess what! I'm becoming friends with that neighbour girl now. Ah, there's no way I can fall for her.. We're hanging out a lot. And after sometime... I just can't stop thinking about her... hmm.. what the hell is going on? Oh crap.. I'm realizing that I've got a crush on her.  That's okay. I won't seek her out for any romance... Friends are friends.. oh She's speaking to me now. Shit! I can't stop thinking about cuddling up with her... I know what I'll do. I'll only be friends with her. After all all these romantic feelings can be kept aside once they have surfaced isnt it?.. oh she's using that soft voice of hers again.... no! no! friends friends!  If you ever had a crush on someone you would know that one doesn't ""seek it out"".   The other meaning that I make out is once the crush happens you shouldn't ask her out. I disagree. In my experience I can't really remain normal friends once I have a crush on someone. If you can do that then that's great. What you're suggesting then becomes a better way out if one has the ability to keep their feelings separate.   Date with the intention of dating. Friends aren't there to fuck or fall in love with.   This again makes multiple different meanings. One is that you're implying is that I'm the kind of guy who goes around making friends with girls with the aim of having sex with them somehow later on. Is that what you mean?   The other is where you're telling me to remind myself that the other person is just being friendly with me and isn't really into me. Yeah, I already know that throughout the friendship. The problem what I was discussing wasn't me mistaking that the friend girl likes me. The problem was me liking her.   Friends aren't there to fuck or fall in love with unless you set out like that from the beginning   Another meaning that you could be trying to say is that when you decide to be friends with someone you should remain friends. When you decide to be dating someone you should do that. A friend shouldn't be dated later on and a date shouldn't be a friend later on.  There's no way you can decide whether you want to date someone or be friends with someone immediately. It's like you just met someone and already you're deciding ""okay friends forever or date forever? Let me choose. And once I've made this choice I'm never going to change again. Okay done. Hey miss! I wanna date you... (creep!!)"" Anyway, I doubt you meant this thing.   look at the common denominator - you're mistaking friendship for reciprocal romantic interest.   Okay my original post was about something a bit different. But this sounds like an interesting point. I'll keep this in mind. Thanks for suggesting!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2sf0nq,Biffingston,3,Thu Jan 15 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"I think what DTapped is saying is that you should be more clear with your intentions from the get-go. You seem to have this belief that you shouldn't ask someone out until you have feelings for them, but by that point it might be too late.   There's nothing wrong with asking someone out you don't know that well, but might potentially be interested in. In fact, the whole point of the first couple dates is to see if you like this person and want to pursue a relationship with them. But it should be very clear that you are testing the waters of romance. That doesn't mean you need to do anything over-the-top or go out to a fancy restaurant, but the way you behave around her should be the way you behave around someone you're interested in romantically. I get that flirting is hard by the way, because I have difficulty with it too, but it's something you need to learn how to do.  It just seems to me like you're rejecting yourself more than the girl is rejecting you. It may not seem that way from your perspective, but by acting like a girl's friend for the first few months, you're setting yourself up for failure. Sure, sometimes a girl can remain interested in you for that length of time, but usually their interest will slowly wane if you don't make a move at some point. By the time you develop feelings and confess them to her, she might not even have the ability to see you as anything other than a platonic friend."

Attraction either happens or it doesn't, and if it doesn't, you can't force it. It has nothing to do with who you are as a person. Someone not being attracted to you does not mean you are a bad person. It just means that you aren't the sort of person who your love interest can jive with. Love matches aren't easy to find. There is no point getting angry at women over something they can't predict (being attracted or not being attracted) and something they largely don't even control. Attraction happens naturally. If you don't click, you don't click - end of story, move on, find someone you DO click with.  It's like finding the pieces of a puzzle that fit together perfectly. Not every puzzle piece is suited to be attached to every single other puzzle piece. Sure, they might be puzzle pieces, but there is a lot more going on than just finding something in common or sharing appealing traits."

Runner up: The Vines on Letterman. His guitar goes out of tune after the first verse when he starts rolling around and is out of tune the rest of the song. At the end he wrecks the set. The band are visibly pissed after this. Turns out he had an untreated disorder, pretty interesting story."

howtonotgiveafuck,2s1yl6,Don_Lupa,1 point,Wed Jan 14 18:51:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's a fine interpretation. Still, the commandment offers no solution (not necessarily in its purview) and leaves us to turn the blame inward, leaving 'the lonely' to own their failures (some of whom who need no such prompting to go revel in their (perceived?) impotence). There is no easy decision in between the choice to externalize (blame circumstance, others) while reaping the emotional benefits of displacing blame, and the more honest (dubious, perhaps) internalization that so often leads to self flagellation, albeit with a better understanding of reality, one would hope.   The truth is, spending time alone with myself and thoughts is not worth the price. I'd rather be truly apart from myself via distraction and drugs."
howtonotgiveafuck,2s1yl6,Incident_Reported,1 point,Wed Jan 14 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"The commandment offers no solution, but it hints towards one: That you will never find release from loneliness from without. Find it in yourself instead!  Realise that no one will understand you fully and learn to be alone with yourself (through love, humour and thankfulness/acceptance towards your inner and outer conditions). It will be very painful, but it is still better than any flight from yourself and your pains: at least it gives you freedom.  It sounds like you believe there is only the choice to feel sorry for oneself or to hate everyone else. There is no reason to blame yourself or anyone for anything! There is just circumstance (which no one can take full responsibility for), the only thing you can change is how you deal with it from now on. Forget the past, move on. Just don't forget how it makes you feel right now, feel that and understand where it comes from.  In my experience distraction only served to take away the pain for a moment, letting it grow in the background, corrupting every moment. Thus everything became either gray or painful, since my happiness was blocked by my ""bad"" emotions. Facing the all the bullshit inside me was the most difficult, painful (!) and freeing thing I have ever done (and am still doing).   Forget thoughts and ideas that try to explain your pain. Instead delve into the dark, because at the bottom lies a cause that you can mend. Pain is part of life, so live it!  ""If you find yourself in hell - keep walking"""

Şi de fiecare dată citesc una din cele zece porunci. De fiecare dată una singură, ca să mă conving s-o urmez.  Iată-le cum sună:   Prima poruncă: Să aştepţi oricît. A doua poruncă: Să aştepţi orice. A treia poruncă: Să nu-ţi aminteşti, în schimb, orice. Nu sînt bune decît amintirile care te ajută să trăieşti în prezent. A patra poruncă: Să nu numeri zilele. A cincea poruncă: Să nu uiţi că orice aşteptare e provizorie, chiar dacă durează toată viaţa. A şasea poruncă: Repetă că nu există pustiu. Există doar incapacitatea noastră de a umple golul în care trăim. A şaptea poruncă: Nu pune în aceeaşi oală şi rugăciunea şi pe Dumnezeu. Rugăciunea este uneori o formă de a spera a celui ce nu îndrăzneşte să spere singur. A opta poruncă: Dacă gîndul ăsta te ajută, nu evita să recunoşti că speri neavînd altceva mai bun de făcut sau chiar pentru a te feri de urmările faptului că nu faci nimic. A noua poruncă: Binecuvîntează ocazia de a-ţi aparţine în întregime. Singurătatea e o tîrfă care nu te învinuieşte că eşti egoist. A zecea poruncă: Aminteşte-ţi că paradisul a fost, aproape sigur, într-o grotă.    http://bookspot.ro/file.axd?file=2010/11/octavian+paler-+viata+pe+un+peron.pdf"

howtonotgiveafuck,2ryw3l,fronteir,-1,Sat Jan 10 19:37:09 2015 UTC,"Yo calm yourself down, nutbag. All Bigdar is saying is HE would leave out #5 as would I. No one is telling OP to change HIS list. We're simply acknowledging what we like (most of it) and saying what we would change if it were OUR list."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ryw3l,fronteir,4,Sat Jan 10 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"Apparently quoting the title of the post makes me an upset nutbag. His comment is just not contributing to the post at all. If he asked about what made him discover/continue believing in God, to see what the other person went through to make his beliefs that way, then that would spark discussion with the OP. Instead he just basically said ""I don't believe in God"", which is great if that's what you believe, it just doesn't need to be commented. That's all I'm saying bud."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ryw3l,JaminDime,2,Sat Jan 10 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Lol I don't believe in God, so those points are kind of moot. I'm just beyond the phase where I feel the need to criticize those that do. I haven't been to church since middle school and haven't really prayed since 9/11.   I do agree that we are way too intellectually incapable of understanding anything that dictates the universe and what we are. Too often we (we being scientific based young people) only see the horrible things of religion. Bigots, religious zealots and extremists, tyrannous leaders of the organized religions etc. But for most people in religion, it gives them a sense of who they are, false or not. The vast majority of people in religion are fundamentally good people.  My local church is filled with some of the nicest people I've met, and they do tons of community service to help those in need. In winter nights they turn their basement into a makeshift homeless shelter with cots and heat, they run a food delivery service for those who can't leave their house. Just because they feel like this appeases some unknown force above, doesn't take anything out of the fact that they are just doing good.  In some sects of some religions, their beliefs may have led them astray in certain categories, but they see that as being good. I'm obviously not a fan of that, but writing comments on an internet forum that is largely agnostic/atheist won't change anything. The Charlie Hebdo terrorists are some of the worst people in the world, for blindly following their faith in such wrong ways. That's the horror side of religion. But there are so many others that have done good in the name of their god.  I feel like I've rambled on enough, but I think we are both on the same side of belief, I just don't see how saying ""I don't believe in religion"" is helpful to those who do. Sure organized religion may be big dick pills, but to the people who believe it works, it makes them happier. Placebo or not.   This is one of my favorite pieces on the matter (although it's been posted on reddit quite often so you may have seen it), and kinda shows how we have no clue what came before us or what will come after us: http://www.multivax.com/last_question.html"

I just said because it seemed like you were overreacting/looked too far into what was said.  I think people feel a compulsion to dismiss or counter statements like ""Talk to God"" because it's such an irrational thing from our perspective. For an otherwise rational list, #5 catches you off guard, but that's what works for OP so that's fine. Just wouldn't be on my list."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ryw3l,JaminDime,1 point,Sat Jan 10 21:19:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, trying to push someone onto something against their beliefs isn't right, which makes it frustrating for us to try to convince religious people that some of their beliefs are skewed. But for example, if someone says ""I'm praying for you"" when I'm injured or in a rough spot, initially it sounds like such a cop out, something that to us won't bring about any change. But in the wider scheme of things, it's just showing they care. Same as, ""I hope you get better friend"".  Thanks for the apology, I could kinda see that I could've been some religious guy that thinks that my religion can't be insulted."

Even though there's no absolute truth or definitive clarity/conclusion to be reached, I think sharing your views on the subject respectfully is valuable. If more people were to put less weight on their unconfirmed beliefs (eg, is God real or not), we'd all get along much better and lowlives wouldn't be killing in the name of God. Our humanity unites us more than our cultures allow us to believe."

Fuck giving is your brain's way of saying ""hey this shit is important, pay attention!"" It's when you give fucks about the wrong things, and let that fuck giving impact your quality of life that it becomes a problem. Practice conscious fuck giving. If you give a fuck about something, pay attention. Ask yourself if this is an appropriate thing to give a fuck about. Spend a few moments or as long as you need to think rationally about whether or not it is appropriate to give a fuck in this situation. You may find it helpful to write or talk aloud to yourself about the problem. Go for it. It makes it easier to separate thinking that is derived purely from emotional reasoning to thinking that comes from your rational faculties. If you find yourself still giving a fuck about bullshit that's okay. Just make a mental note of it and try to let it go. Don't judge- giving a fuck about giving a fuck is a great way to ruin your day."

It's about getting yourself to a place where you can properly process the important events in your life, and cast off the trivial.   This could be either depending on how you define the word ""lover"". If it's fuck buddies, just move on. At most see if they'll give you any info on why so you can improve yourself (but don't bet on a reply). If you were actually in a ""loving relationship"", take the lumps, process your pain, and count your lucky stars you're no longer with someone so inconsiderate.  In either case, Not Giving A Fuck would be letting the event go. It's just one more bump on the very long road of your life. Never let this shit define you. Try to learn from it, then cast it off."

howtonotgiveafuck,2rvxit,Hello_McSwiggans,9,Fri Jan 9 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"Short story time.  Back in 2011 I got a job at a bar/restaurant in midtown Manhattan.  I met a waitress there that I was instantly in love with.  We hit it off, became great friends and then hooked up a lot until one day just nothing.  Not a word, didn't hear from her for about two months.  I went by her place, called, asked her friends, just nothing.  It was terrible. I'd never been so depressed.  Would just wander around central park all morning before I had to be at work at 3 because I didn't feel like being home, wondering still what had happened.  Turns out, she had a really, really bad accident skiing.  She was in the hospital for a really long time, several rounds of surgery, barely awake, the works and nobody knew we were close so nobody bothered to call me.  She finally got in touch with me one day and we're still friends to this day but...I'd never wish that kind of depression on anyone, so, unless you think your lover had a skiing accident, don't spend the next couple of months moping around and feeling bad, carry on, enjoy life, enjoy the learning experience, meet someone new."

howtonotgiveafuck,2rvxit,jonsy777,10,Sat Jan 10 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"Yes and No. The obvious point is that if someone just abruptly loses interest in you then they are clearly not worth your time. You may think the World shines out of their arse but the cold hard truth is that if they can drop you just like that then they were obviously not good enough for you.  However, part of improving as a person is having the ability to reflect on situations and think about what you could have done better. The deterioration of a relationship is rarely down to only one person and there is usually going to be something you could have done differently to improve the relationship (even if that would ultimately still lead to it's failure)."

Because too much good and we become lost, too much bad and we get hurt.   So i created fundamentals like at the age of 12 a child begins the process of bias and must begin his path in understanding what to become. To fight for the Good or Bad. and if we corrupt their choice then we are at fault.  So now i start giving a fuck about everything. Because someone has to care and keep the scales in balance.  okay this very weird.i am sorry."
howtonotgiveafuck,2rrou0,elbags,1 point,Sun Jan 11 20:12:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's not weird, I'm interested in your point of view.   Basically what I understand from what you're saying is this: you've labelled yourself as someone who's on this earth to serve the purpose of 'good' and you must play a key role in balancing the good and the bad. So you feel guilt by not giving a fuck about people and their lives you are in the wrong and are not serving your ultimate purpose. Lemme know if I got it right.  Here are a couple questions for you. Do you blame yourself for things outside your control? Like the whole world is weighing down on your shoulders, associating too much responsibility. So like these kids that are being corrupted by our education system are somehow your fault?  A quote I found really insightful from this article is this ""Don't care about pissing people off while doing something you believe is right or noble"". Not giving a fuck does not mean, not caring about others and being completely self-interested. It means acting on your inner purpose and not giving a shit what others think because you believe that is the most righteous thing to do. That's why giving a fuck is toxic, it keeps you in herd mentality and locks you into a paradigm where you are reacting rather than acting. Giving a fuck about how kids are being corrupted and not being taught proper values is not toxic however, especially if that's something you want to try and solve, or at least improve as it has a huge impact on the world.   But if you want to improve the situation, you're going to face a lot of adversity, a lot of interest groups and a lot of people are just there trying to stop you or criticize what you're doing. Those are the people you should not give a fuck about as they are going to simply discourage you from what you want to accomplish. That's my biggest takeaway from Mark Manson's post, it's that you only have a certain amount of fucks to give, so use them wisely, don't give your fucks away to people's opinions on you or on trivial matters that don't impact reality at a large scale, give a fuck about your life purpose. Choose what you give a fuck about, not everything matters as much, certain things rarely matter, such as others' image of you as a person."

The old coupon lady fits his ideal of not giving a fuck perfectly,  but he paints her as the opposite. She comes from a time when 30 cents was a big fucking deal,  and she fights for that money,  not giving a fuck what the people waiting in line might think about her. And as much as we love Zappa, his quote seems more of the indifferent variety than the truly not giving a fuck ilk. He certainly did care that his music was not more widely accepted,  no matter how much he sometimes pretended not to.

The claim is just that she makes a poor model for your own allocation -- because the small stuff like coupons will take away energy from the big stuff, like building a career and a family, making a difference in the world, taking care of your loved ones, flying model airplanes, etc -- but it could happen to you as an old person if you have nothing going on."

Id probably consider buying the book if it was cheaper, was longer, or you had samples pages up related to your writings about the actual meditation practice/etc."

I would love to be able to pair up with them. I haven't come to a conclusion on a name as of yet and I and to make sure that what I choose isn't someone else's already
howtonotgiveafuck,2rppz2,doorpaint,3,Thu Jan 8 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"Okay, personally I would find those kind of cards distasteful in the extreme and to me, it has absolutely nothing to do with HTNGAF philosophy.  For me, HTNGAF is not not about not giving a fuck about anything at all. It's about mindfulness and careful assessment of where I am allocating my fucks, how I am expressing those fucks, if that fuck allocation is aligned with the direction that I want my life to go in and, if it's not, adjusting my fuck allocations in a timely and meaningful way.  It's not about being a dick. If anything, it's about floating, carefree, on the stormy seas of dickery and helping other people - wherever possible - to do the same.   I am sure these cards are meant to be light hearted gallows humour, and while I do indulge in that myself - it is universally spoken (because tone and timing is important) and almost always directed at myself (I'm British, self effacing humour is the dance of my people). The problem with sending them to another person, irrespective of how well you know them and their style of humour, is that you have no idea what kind of day the receiver has had. A light hearted jibe could quickly become very upsetting.  Furthermore, it puts the receiver (if they did receive it badly) in the difficult position of feeling invalidated because the incredibly shitty and wounding message they just received was a joke. So if they call it out, they're at risk of being hit with that timeless line ""I was just kidding. Can't you take a joke?""  Clearly, the NGAF answer would be ""You're a jerk. I don't need to take anything from you."" But the strength needed for appropriate fuck allocation waxes and wanes - we've all had days where we're just not up to it.    OP, I salute your ambition and urge you to continue to form your ideas - but please remember the human in all this and think carefully about the direction in which your joke is aimed.  TL;DR Be kind - you have no idea what kind of day someone is having."

I married a Dutch Man and well I learned from him quickly to say it and be done.. but that is him...   I also want to do cards that tell people how you enjoy helping them, even if it is from afar, but again as I had stated above the examples I posted were that .. examples of what I had on my mind at the moment...

howtonotgiveafuck,2r3umn,oswald433,14,Fri Jan 2 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for this...it reminded me I transcribed a passage from ""The Tao of Pooh"" once about this and I'm so glad to have been given reason to revisit it.  Here it is in case anyone's interested....   “When we learn to work with our own Inner Nature, and with the natural laws operating around us, we reach the level of Wu Wei. Then we work with the natural order of things and operate on the principle of minimal effort. Since the natural world follows that principle, it does not make mistakes. Mistakes are made–or imagined–by man, the creature with the overloaded Brain who separates himself from the supporting network of natural laws by interfering and trying too hard.  When you work with Wu Wei, you put the round peg in the round hole and the square peg in the square hole. No stress, no struggle. Egotistical Desire tries to force the round peg into the square hole and the square peg into the round hole. Cleverness tries to devise craftier ways of making pegs fit where they don’t belong. Knowledge tries to figure out why round pegs fit into round holes, but not square holes. Wu Wei doesn’t try. It doesn’t think about it. It just does it. And when it does, it doesn’t appear to do much of anything. But Things Get Done.  When you work with Wu Wei, you have no real accidents. Things may get a little Odd at times, but they work out. You don’t have to try very hard to make them work out; you just let them. [...] If you’re in tune with The Way Things Work, then they work the way they need to, no matter what you may think about it at the time. Later on you can look back and say, ""Oh, now I understand. That had to happen so that those could happen, and those had to happen in order for this to happen…"" Then you realize that even if you’d tried to make it all turn out perfectly, you couldn’t have done better, and if you’d really tried, you would have made a mess of the whole thing.  Using Wu Wei, you go by circumstances and listen to your own intuition. ""This isn’t the best time to do this. I’d better go that way."" Like that. When you do that sort of thing, people may say you have a Sixth Sense or something. All it really is, though, is being Sensitive to Circumstances. That’s just natural. It’s only strange when you don’t listen.”  ― Benjamin Hoff, The Tao of Pooh"

When people see some things as good, Other things become bad.  Being and non-being create each other. Difficult and easy support each other. Long and short define each other. High and low depend on each other.  Therefore the Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has but doesn't possess, acts but doesn't expect. When her work is done, she forgets it. That is why it lasts forever. ""  Further anotated,  ""Her actions are appropriate responses. Thus they are effortless. She embodies compassion, yet doesnt try to be compassionate. She doesnt struggle to make money, yet she enjoys spending it when it comes to her. She goes her own way, yet she accepts help gracefully and has no pride in walking alone. She is not elated by praise, not discouraged by neglect. She doesnt give even a moments thought to right and wrong. She never hss to make a decision; decisions arise by themselves. She is like an actress who loves her role. The Tao is writing the script.""  *His/her are interchangable in reference to the Master"

I have a suggestion: just care about people who really wants to see you happy. Focus on them. Focus on how they would love to see you happy and relaxed. When others come to your mind, focus on the people who want to see you happy even more.  As your brain becomes happier this way, you stop giving a fuck about people who don't mean much to you, and you start to focus on the ""not giving a fuck attitude"" in a way that your psychology will be happy about it. If your psychology makes you get more and more serotonin every time, you try this, you will become happier by the result, and your problems will fade away.  In my case, God, my grandmothers, my mom, they are the ones who really want to see me happy. I focus on them, and it makes me happy the second I think about them in this relational way.  And don't tolerate suckers, just leave all your fake friends, and fake people who want to see you unhappy behind.  Surround yourself with positive minds, positive people, and positive experiences.

It is craving which renews being and is accompanied by relish and lust, relishing this and that: in other words, craving for sensual desires, craving for that which we want but do not have or get.  The Third Noble Truth is that suffering can be overcome and happiness attained. When we give up useless craving and learn to live each day at a time, enjoying without restlessly wanting the experiences that life offers us, patiently enduring the problems that life involves, without fear, hatred and anger, then we become happy and free.   What is the Noble Truth of the Way Leading to the Cessation of Suffering?

howtonotgiveafuck,2qtjjf,Canismajoris88,36,Wed Dec 31 01:36:57 2014 UTC,"I started experimenting with drugs (mainly Cannabis, some mushrooms, acid and DMT). Basically i found myself. I also meditated and changed my view on life. I had to first find the root of what caused my depression & anxiety and deal with it. every.single.time. It is a hard road but ""not giving a fuck"" which i think means to not let others judgement effect your mind state (well, that's how i perceive it) is what has made me happy. Do things for you and because you want to do them not because of fear of judgement or pressure from others (note: don't listen if you are an asshole). Good luck friend. Hang in there and enjoy every moment because one day your time will run out and i cant think of anything worse than dying and regretting the decisions i have made."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qtjjf,Canismajoris88,6,Tue Dec 30 18:36:29 2014 UTC,"I do not mind at all. For me it was super low confidence with a ""strange"" childhood. My father has mild autism (i suspect, he hasn't been diagnosed), but he was more like an annoying older brother than a father figure. He had depression and i likely picked up on that behavior as i grew up. It really got worse when i left high school and entered the work force. Thats when depression turned to anxiety. I didnt cry often but i would be so anxious i would cry in the toilets, very confusing as at the time i couldn't identify why.  I had such low confidence that i didn't even try to excel in my work (electrician). This caused my co workers to think i was lazy and had a bad attitude which was not the case. Eventually i learnt to give it your best and that's all you can do. ""The road to success was paved with failure"".   Now i am a Supervisor at a Telcom company and have a 10month old girl with another on the way. Just moved into my own house and have been married for a year. What helped me the most (at my peak of depression) was seeing a psychologist... I only did 5 sessions but i don't know where i would be now without those 5 hours. It is in no way weak to seek mental help. (this also prompted me to study psychology at home for fun, it helped me identify behaviors that was further bringing me down such as saying things to myself like i was worthless etc).  Enjoy my wall of text. To all that are experiencing similar issues, know this: With age comes confidence. If anyone needs any tips or pointers feel free to sling me a PM."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qtjjf,buttholemuffin,6,Wed Dec 31 01:54:12 2014 UTC,"I'm a weird mix of anxious and not giving a fuck.   It's a pretty dangerous mix because I'll get really anxious about something and not care when it could potentially be a problem. Like with a health issue or something that hurts and I just let it go.   But on the other hand it's pretty sweet because I'm fully self aware of what's happening when I get anxious. I know it's my brain being a dick. That helps a lot. It took years of therapy to get that strong willed and minded. I kept telling myself it's just my brain, and thus the not give a fuck was born."
howtonotgiveafuck,2qtjjf,noah_arcd_left,3,Mon Jan 5 16:28:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like I've become more self-absorbed. I've brought this up with friends and family, which they agree is true. They also generally agree that it's better than seeing how miserable I was before and justify it as being related to some health issues I've had/have. However, the novelty will wear off and I don't like being so narcissisistic. I find one of my main habits now is that I tend to make conversations all about me. That's a big one I'm working on, I feel like it has a bit to do with suddenly accepting my accomplishments. I had a pretty big shift from glass-half-empty to glass-half-full, and it was refreshing to talk about challenges in my life from a proactive perspective. It just made me momentarily over-prioritize my own challenges compared to those of my loved ones. Maybe they didn't mind, but that is something I've been giving a fuck about. So I guess I'm not fully at the mindfullness point yet. I should stress, though, that the general consensus is I seem happier.   Edit: Also, for my own emotions, one thing that's changed is issues don't feel life-or-death anymore. I used to treat damn near everything as top priority and failure was worth than death. This often made me cognitively petrified. I have a better perspective of how important specific consequences really are and am able to use this to calm my approach to handling them. That being said, I do have a ton of relapses into anxiety, but knowing I can get out of it really helps. I used to use meds (SSRIs) for this but have been off them for over a year now :)"

I ended up taking about an eighth. It was the most beautiful experience of my life, but it forced me to confront my deep-rooted anxiety. I spent about half an hour crying, pouring my heart out to my friends.   After I gathered myself from my breakdown, my friend turned to me and said, ""You only have a certain amount of time to spend here, why would you spend it scared to live?"" As he said that, I felt a weight lifted off of my shoulders.   I still get anxious, but I'm much more open and comfortable in regular situations. It was a huge step forward for me, and I know I'll only become more open and happy.   People say I seem happier and more open and honest, and that I have less of a wall and I don't over analyze everything into oblivion. My friends say I'm much more agreeable and more fun to be around."

A trend I've noticed in the HNTGAF community however, is the idea that the goal of HNTGAF isn't to not give a fuck about anything, but rather to save your fucks for things that you should care about. (http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/2g00xu/general_fuckanomics/)  For example, social media. In all honestly, we don't need to give a fuck about social media (for a bunch of reasons). The problem is that we are compelled to care about it because of our dopamine craving towards it. It would take some effort, but we could detach ourselves from social media and be better off for it.  In my opinion, there are some situations where you should give a fuck (like caring enough to not get addicted to drugs) and situations where you shouldn't (like porn, social media, and the like).

howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,redfatty888,2,Mon Dec 29 02:09:36 2014 UTC,"I never feel dopamine hit when I am exercising or fucking - not like I do with music. I'm sure it happens, as I feel good physically and mentally during/after both, but it's probably more of a trickle. It's not notable - not like when I listen to music, and the floodgates open. Not all music, obviously, but some songs tend to really work well.  I searched for information about this a few years ago, as I didn't know that this was a common phenomenon - I thought that something was wrong with my ear-brain connection, because music had such an uncommon effect on me (I don't cry often).  Do a google search for ""Dopamine Music"", and within the span of a few articles you'll get into some of the science of it. It's pretty interesting."
howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,redfatty888,2,Mon Dec 29 03:40:26 2014 UTC,"I don't get how that has to do with dopamine. Dopamine is usually associated with feeling good, that's why it's such a good motivator: it rewards behaviour with feeling good. Music probably can make your brain release dopamine but if you're crying, that might be a different neurotransmitter."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,redfatty888,1 point,Mon Dec 29 20:05:01 2014 UTC,"I'm a big fan of Tool. A few of their longer songs that transition between heavy and soft tempos and volumes hit me hard.  I saw them live in 2012, and they played Pushit. This song builds up and drops a few times, with a climax and then drop at the end. They immediately flowed into an instrumental that started soft and built tempo and volume over the course of a few minutes and then dropped... and then they played Schism, which is shorter but does the same sort of build-up to a climax and then drop. It was dopamine soup that night.  I'll list a few other notables that usually work on me:  Pink Floyd:  Time  Pigs (Three Different Ones)  Comfortably Numb  Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds:  Jubilee Street  Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum  Black Hair  The Ship Song  O Children  Babe, You Turn Me On  A Perfect Circle:  The Noose  Gravity  By And Down  There are a bunch of other songs.

And at that point, it gets really damned interesting. But unfortunately, it doesn't stick with the subject of dopamine or brain chemistry associated with it for long enough.  I didn't know if it was the way that Radiolab normally does business, but their background sound effects, and repetitions such as the woman's speech repeating (until it becomes music) were extremely annoying to me. It's the little things that they do - talking about how you perceive sound, speech, and music as an infant, so they naturally have a baby cooing in the background while they try to explain this. Or explaining the electrical impulses, and hearing the shuffling noise over and over and over. Or the ""neurons"" talking to each other.  The discussions and information are great, but the way that they convey it is distracting."
howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,flasd,2,Sat Jan 3 06:56:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's how they used to do things, I think to try and hold people's attention. When I started listening to radiolab I was listening to the newer ones which cut almost all of that type of stuff out, this one was from season 2 and they are now on 13. I've gotten used to the weird noises going back through their archives, but I understand how annoying it can be.   I was also disappointed they didn't go into the emotional impacts of music more because I'm sure there are some other good studies out there on it. Anyways I'm glad you gave it a listen"

Though I think you're saying something valuable, I think getting your shit together is something different than not giving a fuck.

I was lurking recently, and I noticed how many people are ashamed of their depression/mental illness, pride, what people will think of them when you reach out.  This proof that:   Chemically, people without the ability to produce normal/healthy amount of dopamine are not going to enjoy their lives. You are not just sad or hopeless or lazy. You have a medical condition. Also, if it's a medical condition and not any reflection of you as a person, why give a fuck about what people think of them receiving medical help to give you more dopamine. Last, reading this, it occurred to me why people with depression may take risks or try to self medicate to get enough dopamine to try to get through the day.   I am very glad you posted this.

howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,leventcemaydan,2,Mon Dec 29 01:57:46 2014 UTC,Consider giving a nod to Hebbian learning.   The neurochemical function of dopamine is only a minor venture down rabbit hole with regards to addiction. It pokes and prods at the motivational aspects of things and can demonstrate how we begin to get stuck in detrimental loops. But it is Hebbian learning that shows us why we remain stuck.
howtonotgiveafuck,2qngu9,mrbruiser,1 point,Mon Dec 29 11:15:33 2014 UTC,"Hebbian theory:       Hebbian theory is a theory in neuroscience which proposes an explanation for the adaptation of neurons in the brain during the learning process. It describes a basic mechanism for synaptic plasticity, where an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from the presynaptic cell's repeated and persistent stimulation of the postsynaptic cell. Introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior,  the theory is also called Hebb's rule, Hebb's postulate, and cell assembly theory.

howtonotgiveafuck,2qju6v,classydank,5,Sat Dec 27 22:08:13 2014 UTC,"Sure. I wasn't sure which was where you were coming from but I saw a few applicable ideas behind what you were saying; you were possibly talking about how happy people never need look beyond their own immediate life and therefore never see the help others need, or possibly you were touching on how suffering, if one can recover from it, is often a means of insight into the suffering of others and can actually be the cause of humanitarianism within people.. therefore having not suffered you're not really of much use to know how to deal with suffering. Also, thinking about it; you might have been talking about people who pursue happiness, even, and how that is a selfish cause. Or even how unrest and unhappiness brings about necessary change..  (these ideas are now just coming to me as I type, lol, sorry). Of course, I could be completely wrong and I should probably have asked what you meant in my initial comment.. I'd still be interested to know all the same.  With all that being said, I disagree in that happy people definitely can be of benefit. A happy child can hugely benefit a parent; likewise, a happy parent and upbringing can hugely benefit a child. A happy workforce can hugely benefit a company, etc.   Personally, I think I'm on the same page as you; I imagine I only came up with those theories because I can recognise them (subjectively, ofc), I just wouldn't go as far as to say no happy people can benefit others.. I'd probably word it ""A happy person is rarely of benefit to anyone but him/herself"" or.. maybe that's even a bit much still."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qfp76,DammitDan,29,Fri Dec 26 13:46:53 2014 UTC,"Space is key.  It's the only way to reset the ""friend zone"" once you're that far in.  Date other chicks in the meantime.  A) you might find a better option.  B) you won't seem clueless about girls when/if she ever comes around. C) she might even get a little jealous."
howtonotgiveafuck,2qfp76,Hello_McSwiggans,17,Fri Dec 26 14:37:23 2014 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. Space is key...no contact, maybe just the occasional hi here and there. Give the ""I'm moving on and doing just fine"" vibe. You'll be in a much better when you see her next.   Just be sure to embody the mentality that you can live with or without her, and you will be just peachy regardless when you see her next."

Made things awkward with one of my best girl friends this past September, big mistake due to drug induced hallucinations on both our parts. She won't soon forget the day I told her how I felt, and there will be many months in between then and when we will see each other again. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, but even if it doesn't, things will return to normal with time.  Weird how one of the best days of your life can also be one of the worst."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qfp76,mrbruiser,3,Sat Dec 27 00:00:32 2014 UTC,"Edit: I say long story short, because holy shit it is way longer than even this wall of text that follows.  Long story short, I asked her to dance on the second day of a fest when we were really grooving with the music. We grinded for a few songs, and then my trip peaked and the world around me dissolved. What I saw doesn't matter, because what I actually did was dive through a crowd, made my way to the front, and disappeared from my friends for a bit.  I came back and was like ""did you guys see that?"" Referencing some hallucination I was having, and then I told ""Sally"" I loved her and we needed to quit smoking cigarettes. She was tripping too and it was too much for her to take in, she then disappeared with one of our friends to talk about the weird shit I imagine.  I was taken back to our base camp by my best friend and his gf, where they gave me xanax to kill off the trip, which also makes you kinda really bummed. And I started to see things how they were after I stopped tripping, and realized just how cringey everything was now that I wasn't in the throes of having taken to much.  TL; DR everything in moderation, know your limits, and don't follow everyone else's lead."

howtonotgiveafuck,2qfp76,theburlyone,0,Fri Dec 26 14:53:49 2014 UTC,"I had a guy friend like me for 4 years and when he even slightly touched me like gave me a hug or something, I was not happy...or I just didn't like it. Fast forward to now and me and him actually had a relationship..BUT he went and got another girl. A year later he came back saying how sorry he was and I was the one he wants...but it's too late now. I was too badly hurt. And he cant stand it that I'm not giving in again. When I did give in was when I began seeing him for him really and that's when I fell in love...but he took that and fucked it up. So sometimes you may not know it but girls sometimes have LEGIT reasons (fear, rejection issues) for not taking your confession to heart. But you know what, I always say, keeping on gets you somewhere. And you have nothing to lose. And maybe in a year or so, you guys will be sending awesome texts back and forth...the ones you want to see! Good luck!"

It's like housework: if you let it pile up, it's just going to be that much harder when you actually do it, and you'll have to live with the mess in the meantime. Be straight up with people, give no fucks, and it gets a lot easier to manage your relationships, making the most of good ones and cutting out bad ones (or unproductive/meaningless ones) as soon as possible."

Curious about this old fellow, the general went to the temple to see for himself what kind of man this master was. When he wasn’t treated with the deference and submissiveness to which he was accustomed, the general burst into anger. “You fool,” he shouted as he reached for his sword, “don’t you realize you are standing before a man who could run you through without blinking an eye!”  But despite the threat, the master seemed unmoved. “And do you realize,” the master replied calmly, “that you are standing before a man who can be run through without blinking an eye?”"

If they are both derived from the same kind of fear, insecurities and whatnot perhaps the voice of reason isn't really something we should listen to and that it infact only stifle us just as self-doubt does. Perhaps reason is just another scapegoat for us when we don't dare to do what we really want  Even  if  that's not what OP meant to me that's a powerful thought."

The voice of self-doubt is a lot like C-3PO telling Han Solo the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field in Empire Strikes Back; it's technically sound and logical information but I'm really not trying to hear it when I'm doin' my thing.

howtonotgiveafuck,2q540d,searching777,2,Sat Dec 27 14:20:02 2014 UTC,"I started meditating before bed recently. It can be from 5-10 minutes. I don't really time it, or require specific amounts of it. It helps calm me down, and prepare myself for bed.  As far as saying positive things about yourself while feeling negative, I don't know about that practice, a large part of it involves bringing up the fact that you are feeling inferior. Accept your thoughts as what they are, just thoughts. You are already perfect, all you can do from this moment on is become better.   You can't compare yourself to others, at this moment, you are in tact and just you. all you can do from this point is move forward, so if you are breathing and not dying at an advanced rate, you are pretty much on par with everyone else.  Once we accept our flaws rather than conceal them, it opens us up to the ability to love ourselves completely rather than just the positive bits.  So my advice is to just breathe. Let your thoughts pass and focus on breathing. imagine your breath as a triangle with one side being in, out, and then the pause leading back to the inward breath. You are doing okay.  I used to be a shut-in and was diagnosed with PTSD from childhood trauma. I was a nervous wreck, panic attacks, avoidance, etc but I've come a long ways. You are okay. :)"

Your teacher gave you a specific set of guidelines to follow, and you didn't do that. In the ""real world"" the same thing applies. I'm an engineer, and there are often specific regulations that I have to follow for reasons that I don't always know, but they exist for reasons that other engineers determined are necessary. When I ask why something must be done a specific way, I've never once been told ""just do it because I said so."" There has always been something that I didn't understand or that I wasn't aware of from the beginning. If my boss told me to design something that complies with certain regulations and I did otherwise, I would be reprimanded and have to re-do it.  Sure, it's great to be unique and think outside of the box. However, that doesn't mean just because you're trying to being creative it's actually being helpful and solving a problem."

As an engineer, you're pretty much required to follow a set of rules without deviating. Sure, you can think outside the box when you're trying to figure out a solution to a problem, but not everyone needs a recipe for accomplishment."
howtonotgiveafuck,2pya3n,nogods_nokings,2,Sun Dec 21 22:00:08 2014 UTC,"Which is why OP would likely choose a career path that is more flexible with how one approaches a subject.   Unless you're self employed and working on your own projects or in R&D, you're pretty much guaranteed to have to stick within certain boundaries. Financial planners and stock brokers are constantly being hounded by the SEC and FINRA. Accountants have very strict rules and regulations to follow, and the basic concepts of accounting aren't very flexible in the slightest. Sure, marketing you have some creative freedom, but 99% of the time your customers are giving you some sort of outline they want to follow.    As an engineer, you're pretty much required to follow a set of rules without deviating.   Actually, I have a lot of freedom in the design process. Probably more so than most other professions. There are generally still some requirements that must be met (like a bolt must be a certain material), but the majority of the time that doesn't greatly impact the rest of the design.  It is great to be unique within the constraints you're given. The point of my original comment was that comparing  the creativity of writing an English paper to Steve Jobs and the founding of Apple are very different. Steve was starting a company. He didn't really have anyone to answer to. It was a new field without much restriction. I guarantee now though, if you were to interview an engineer or designer at Apple, they have very strict guidelines they have to follow to comply with the identity that Apple has established for itself."

I agree with your willingness to go beyond what the teacher asked for - that's what artists/inventors do - that's how some of the greatest things happen.  Just played music a few weeks ago for a small event featuring the director of Grease, and he told a story about how the most successful episode of a show he worked on he was told not to run it and to rework it, just before that authority went on a trip and Randal ran the show anyway.  It tested some boundaries of gender & sexual issues and was a big success.  That said, if someone you respect gives you negative feedback, it is important to evaluate that feedback seriously and see if there is an important lesson to be learned."

howtonotgiveafuck,2pk9jb,logic_card,15,Wed Dec 17 09:19:08 2014 UTC,I think a distinct point that is often missed on this subreddit is that the power of how to not give a fuck is being in control of your fucks. Being able to choose what you do and don't give a fuck about is much more useful than not giving a fuck about anything despite what many people here seem to believe.

I could go on a huge rant about how the neurological wiring of the brain makes this an important distinction to realize, but for brevity just consider this.   The brain is unable to ""not"" do something. For instance...  Don't think about a pink elephant.   Don't realize that you are breathing.   Don't think about the last thing you ate.   You failed miserably at all of these tasks and I know this because trying to ""not"" think of something will always backfire. It just doesn't work with the way the brain is wired.   Therefore to ""not"" give a fuck about something, your time is much better spent refocusing your attention on more worthwhile thoughts than trying to eliminate the troubling one's."

I've made a rule with myself: whenever I think about doing something good, and I second guess myself on it, I HAVE TO DO IT. Cute girl eating dinner alone across the dining hall? Have to talk to her. Biking home the easy way cause I'm too tired to take that big hill? Fuck you hill, I'm about to make you my bitch. The best part is that the end result doesn't matter.  I might get shot down by that cute blonde, but so what? There are literally thousands of other girls on campus that might not turn me down. My bike chain might snap 3/4 of the way up the hill (as it once did). But you know what? I've got some great tunes playing, it's a beautiful night, and ad soon as I walk my bike the rest of the way up, it's all downhill from there. I can buy another chain tomorrow and try again.  It's the act of just doing it that fucking sets you free. It's liberating as fuck."

Lately, when bad things happen to me, especially if it's due to my own laziness or clumsiness, I can't help but laugh at the situation. I take it as a reminder to myself to never take the easy/lazy way."
howtonotgiveafuck,2pbzv6,StrangeWonka,3,Tue Dec 16 00:57:24 2014 UTC,"Right? Perfect example: just a few hours ago I was relaxing a bit, reviewing for my Latin final tomorrow. I was doing Latin tonight, and Econ tomorrow, as my Econ exam was scheduled for Wednesday night at 7. No problem, plenty of time. At 4, I got an email from my Econ prof, reminding us of the final exam TONIGHT. I had three hours to prepare for an unexpected exam in a class I hadn't yet reviewed for at all, and I still flat-out didn't know a lot of the material. I freaked out. I started stressing and reading the textbook, desperately trying to memorize everything. I was a complete headcase. Around 6:15, though, I stopped and thought about my situation. I accepted the fact that I was completely and utterly fucked. Nothing I could possibly do at this point would help. And so I just started laughing at myself. Hey, shit happens. I fucked up and wrote the wrong date down. Who cares? Can't fix it now. The only thing left to do is take the damn test. So I put on my best pump-up music, strutted across campus to my exam building, and did as best as I could with what I knew and basic reasoning. And you know what? It really wasn't that bad. I mean I certainly didn't set the curve or anything, but I totally passed. If worst comes to worst, I'll just retake the class and do better next time. I'm about to walk back and keep going on Latin, cause that exam actually is tomorrow. And the best part about it all? I'm finishing exams a day early! Now instead of Wednesday being full of stress and studying, I can just chill and pack up my things and get ready to fly home Thursday. Sometimes you fuck up, but you've just gotta make the most of the situation."

You should try to make others happy and make strong relationships with people, but as soon as it starts to affect your happiness, stop giving a fuck. Don't focus on them though, and don't let your happiness revolve around them. Focus on yourself above all else. That should just help you determine your own happiness.

There's no one-step process to make a potentially fatal disease easy to deal with, but I'm sending light your way.   That said, you need to focus on the present moment, now more than ever. If she's alive, and can smile, and can go to the movies or out to dinner, just do those things. Trust me, there's plenty or worrying and crying that's going to be completely legitimate in your future. You need to not let yourself worry about that worry. Enjoy whatever moment you can with your mom, because even if she lives through the cancer, those happy moments will likely become very rare as the disease and her treatment progresses.  The trick is to only let yourself worry about that when its time.   People here say over and over again that there are times when it's okay, even encouraged, to give a fuck. When it comes to cancer and moms, I believe fucks should definitely be given. However, don't let yourself start giving fucks about what could happen. The best thing you can do for your mom is NGAF about the potentially disastrous, and instead put that energy into being present and positive in her life.   I hope for the best, friend.

Met some new friends that were so relaxed and so welcoming that it kind of shocked me. They were happy around everyone and really enjoyed all the little things. Myself being a goal-driven person like yourself, with really high ideals and ego, I felt kind of incompatible with them. It was sad, as I realized I'll never be so secure and so open.  Like yourself, I've always found myself more talkative when I'm around people that I feel I'm better then. I'm bound to compare myself to others, and even though I try really hard to limit this notion with a set of principles, for example I decided to identify myself with only my character and not skills or abilities, I still find myself subconciously acting like a boss when I feel I'm among lesser beings and vice-versa.  I had no idea how to behave in this new group of friends. They just didn't care. They had absolutely no brakes and nothing was awkward. And I was thinking more about how to impress them, rather than living in the moment.  It was a new experience and an insight in what could be, but not a life-changer. I basically knew all of this before, just didn't experience it firsthand. I want to change, I'd love being as free as they are, but I have no idea how, or if it's even possible. I think it's not."

howtonotgiveafuck,2p5n3h,SavageOrc,3,Sat Dec 13 15:37:22 2014 UTC,"Start now, because if you are going to encounter any douches, it will be right after the new year. Folks join the gym in droves at the start of the year because of resolutions they don't keep. In 3-4 months 80% of the new comers will be gone.   The folks that regularly go  to the gym: 1) don't care what you look like, 2) will give you the nod of respect if you keep showing up past the point when most people quit 3) will help you if you ask.  It will be easier to get started if you start before it gets crowded after the new year. Go today. Also, go during off-hours if you can during the new year's rush. The rush isn't terrible, it is just something you have to deal with for a couple weeks a year.  Lastly, don't just do cardio. Lift weights. More muscle = higher metabolism. A higher metabolism = better results. No you won't turn into a hulking mass unless you want to (it takes years of heavy training, disciplined diet, and  chemical assistance to become a Mr. Universe type).   Don't be intimated by the folks who lift weights, they are often the friendliest people in the gym."

howtonotgiveafuck,2p5n3h,AnonymousAutonomous,1 point,Sat Dec 13 07:23:08 2014 UTC,"Who gives a shit bro. Everyone there is sweaty and smelly, if you dont go to the gym often, chances are you notice the scent of the gym very easily, that odor of pure liquid effort and pheromones.  Its not something you are supposed to look good for. Half the time, I wear pretty much just rags to the gym. Shit thats been chewed up, torn, ripped and stained/painted. Why? Because no one gives a shit, its easier not to care about getting something dirty, that clothing can be thrown out any time if I find it comfortable, I look literally like an animal with shit clothing and everyone knows I am there to do only one thing. Pick shit up and then put it down, with proper form and a proportional amount of rage [aided by music].   You dont like the way you look? Do something about it, use those feelings as a tool if it works, work at it until you start to look are carved out of wood like Pinocchio. I have become a naturally calm person just because I bring all my rage and anger to the gym with me, sit down, take out my phone and select what would be my favorite songs to go on a rampage with. Then I put that shit on and everything but me, the music and the iron disappears. Do the same if it suits you, ignore everyone and everything but whatever motivates and keeps you working to better yourself. I started flexing a lot in the mirror when I first started lifting weights, I loved watching muscles grow nearly in front of my eyes and that might sound very self-centered, and it is. If anyone here does the same, just please dont be a douche about it in front of others. The advantages that simply flexing in the mirror are enormous. One reason is that if you like your development, it will keep you going. Another, more important note is that as you flex in front of the mirror, your brain learns where a certain muscle is and better maps it out in your mind for the next time you lift, better isolating it. The only other thing is doing the right exercises and form while performing them, easy if you have done research. Dont make up your own bullshit exercises and generally dont be this guy and you should be good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hagb4lD2m7A  TL;DR: Do it for yourself and fuck everyone else. Use music if it helps. The ONLY things I HAVE to strongly urge you do is follow the two main rules of gym: DONT GET INJURED and LIFT WITH PROPER FORM. If anyone needs any tips or guidance on how to not give a fuck or on working out for WHATEVER goal you have (or, preferably a combination of both)"

I'm not fat or skinny, but I looked like i should be lifting a lot more. Because of that, I did not enjoyed being there. It's the day when I just stopped caring what ""they"" might have thought of me that I started enjoying going to the gym. It is hard at first, but do force yourself to go and just take that feeling of uneasiness. Feel it, recognized it, and learn to not run away whenever it showed itself. Do it for a few days, or even weeks, and one day during one of your intensive sets, you'll realized that you're just happy that you're doing so much more than what you'd started out with.

If you see someone on the street and you think they are judging your body you can't really do anything about it. You just have to ignore it. But when you think someone is giving you that look in the gym, you have an immediate defense in your head because your there to do something about it. It's actually the only place where your brain has that defense of ""ok my body may not be perfect but here I'm visibly doing something about it so I don't give a fuck what you think of me"".

Everyone at a gym knows how hard it is: the sweat, the pain, the wish that it could all be over and we could just stop. But the kind of people who go to a gym know why they're there - to make themselves better than they were yesterday. They also know that's why you're there - to make yourself better. Everyone in that room is thinking the same thing as you, you have more in common with them than anyone else. As many other commenters have said, most will have more respect for you, and will want to help if you ask, than they do for the muscle-heads.

howtonotgiveafuck,2p1io5,mocodity,2,Fri Dec 12 15:59:56 2014 UTC,"My hesitation is the cost.  I did a groupon for the first one ($30) but the regular cost is $70 a float for the only float house nearby.  That's not in my budget.  It's a really nice place, though. Well thought-out."

I plan on getting a package for like 5 floats at a place near me because i already know how much i am going to love it."

He is an actor and MMA announcer/ex fighter who has a podcast called the Joe Rogan experience where he basically just talks to awesome people about life.
howtonotgiveafuck,2p1io5,Lovingly_nagging,4,Sun Dec 14 19:26:36 2014 UTC,"Every summer, at least once, when we go to the lake I swim out until there's no one around and just close my eyes and float. It always feels like I'm out there way longer than I really am. I can't describe it without sounding cheesy. You start to hallucinate  in your mind. Like pure meditation. I've had some amazing premonitions and sometimes it's just.... Nothing. A great chance to relax and let your worries go. Sometimes I like to visualize all my cares bleeding out of me into the water and when I come out, refreshed."
howtonotgiveafuck,2p1io5,Soigieoto,6,Sun Dec 14 22:34:17 2014 UTC,"I've floated a few times, I would not describe the experience as not giving a fuck. Sure you don't do anything but like that's very different than not giving a fuck. I like it but it's definitely not as amazing as some make it out to be.   I guess it could be training wheels to not giving a fuck if you need that but I really think not giving a fuck comes from a mental state and reaction to stimuli not an absence of stimuli."

This is great what you're doing, I've been doing some vulnerability challenges all semester in hopes of harnessing the NGAF myself and I think people need to be made aware of how much life there is to live if they broaden their mind. What are you thinking long term with psych is it something you wanna pursue further? If you ever wanna shoot the shit sometime PM me, from one golden bear to another."

howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,spron,5,Thu Dec 11 06:59:34 2014 UTC,"You're so right that it's a logistics issue so frequently.   What Colorado has done that has drastically reduced the number of pets euthanized in shelters is to make sure every animal is spayed/neutered BEFORE it leaves the shelter. The difficulty here is that animals have to stay in the shelter longer while they wait for appointments and while they heal. We're at a point now where we can transfer pets from shelters with higher numbers of surrenders to areas with lower areas of surrenders. But that has it's challenges as well.   Colorado has a high population of immigrants from Mexico. They are really bad about getting their pets altered. They also prefer pitt bulls and chihuahuas so shelters in areas with lots of migrant workers or immigrants are flooded with them. Denver has a breed ban against pitties to we can't transfer them here, where there are more adopters.   Colorado also has a good amount of active breed rescues. So shelters can surrender the breeds that are more frequently returned, like Italian Greyhounds and herding breeds, to rescues who can more successfully place them.   I wonder if you could serve on the policy side of some of these orgs and apply your talents there. An unpaid internship could get you in the door and give you a chance to show off your skills. I know we'd love to have someone who could streamline our processes, some of which are super clunky.   But I agree with the others who are saying this is an excellent place to give a fuck.   I've been volunteering pretty heavily for the last 12 years and while I don't feel like I've personally done all that much I know cumulatively I've made a perceivable dent in the problem and a huge difference for the dogs I've raised funds for and fostered.   Good luck!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,spron,2,Thu Dec 11 07:39:39 2014 UTC,"thank you for this. its funny because rescues and shelters in my area will do shipments of homeless cats and dogs up to places like Colorado, Massachusetts and so on where there are not enough adoptable pets.   i did not know that italian greyhounds were frequently returned. any idea why? my friend has one and he is so cute, little and sweet...  thank you."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,blahbah,2,Thu Dec 11 18:46:38 2014 UTC,"IG's were bread for companionship. They like to be around people or other dogs and they can get destructive or neurotic if they're left alone a lot. Also, they have tiny little bladders and need to go frequently. If they don't have a pet door or aren't paper trained they will go in the house. They hate cold or wet weather so it's difficult to get them to go outside even if they do have a pet door in winter weather. Most people won't tolerate multiple accidents in the house and with an IG that's just something you have to deal with sometimes. In particular in shelter dogs, they were probably surrendered for that vary reason.   Finally, they're expensive. They have horrible teeth (tight lips and no drool to clean therm) and need frequent dental work to keep their teeth. Many people neglect the yearly dental care because it's so expensive then are faced with a thousand dollars of necessary dental care and surrender the dog rather than pay it. They are also prone to broken legs if people let them jump off the back of the sofa or from other high places and the cost to fix a broken leg properly (they have to be fixed surgically with a titanium plate and screws) is around $4000. So people surrender them or abandon them at a vet's office for that.   They are super sweet and loving but they also require lots of attention, patience and money so they aren't the right breed for everyone, that's for sure!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,dolcedroga,1 point,Thu Dec 11 20:29:38 2014 UTC,"Huh, I didn't know that other states didn't require spay/neuter to adopt. It seems like common sense. Also, every pet adoption I've been through here comes with tons of discounts and freebies for things like vet visits, medicine, supplies, etc. to ensure people are set up to care for the animal (and reduce returns to the shelter). I'm surprised it's not done more elsewhere."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,reddetter,9,Thu Dec 11 23:59:41 2014 UTC,"Not very popular on reddit but have you considered vegetarianism?

howtonotgiveafuck,2oxx3w,bonecrusher1,7,Thu Dec 11 06:46:35 2014 UTC,"of course! it is a little easier said than done, after a lifetime of being a meat eater. i am very conscious about where my food comes from however. i only buy pasture raised meat products including cage free pasture raised eggs, and i minimize the amount of times a week i eat meat. TBH, when living alone i only eat meat maybe once per week.   there isn't a difference between how a dog cat pig cow chicken feels, but there is a difference in that we created this problem of overpopulation with pets. cows and pigs and chickens are terribly mistreated in factory farms and otherwise...but they are not starving wandering the streets. there is something especially poignant to me that my cat, just by pure chance gets to live a cushy inside life whereas there is absolutely no difference to him and the cat in the dumpster. it is just luck of the draw with cats and dogs, and since our culture treats them as pets i can not justify slaughtering 3 million per year of the unlucky ones.   thank you for your suggestion, and please do know i have taken this greatly to heart now and in the past."

howtonotgiveafuck,2oxtpl,mee412,5,Thu Dec 11 04:58:09 2014 UTC,"""Sorry. I'll be honest and say that I'm really nervous for some reason.""   Don't do this.  You're asking for something irrelevent from the audience before you start.  Women get sympathy with this line, men do not.  Public speaking can be stressful, and stress reduces your ability to think straight and communicate well.  It literally shortcircuits your cleverness with your fight or flight response.  Solutions:   practice!  Join your local toastmasters or equivalent organisation.  (I did this and it works wonders). pause as you speak, especially between major points.  2-3 seconds (which feels like FOREVER) comes across as very powerful to the audience and helps relax you. maintain eye contact with people (a few seconds each, in turn).  this keeps people on focus and actually relaxes you. find a nodder in the group.  (there usually is one).  A person who nods as you speak, gives off a generally receptive vibe.  This is your go-to person if you get nervous or feel you need support.  Look at them for a bit before looking around the room. avoid any frowners or head shakers.  Absolutely never keep an eye on them to ""see if you've got their approval yet"".  Simply don't look at them, except maybe as you make a really great point and you're feeling super confident and want to keep their attention."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oxtpl,MattyAnon,3,Thu Dec 18 19:23:43 2014 UTC,"Sing in public. Seriously! I know it sounds awful (and for most people, it probably will be), but if you can force yourself to go through that once then speaking in public is nothing. I had a trainer make me do that last summer, and it really really helped me. Another tip I picked up from him was that ""nervousness is just energy. Use that energy as enthusiasm for what you're talking about"". I always get jittery before I speak, but when I reframe it that way it helps me to bring my focus away from my nervousness and back to what I'm speaking about. Practice, practice, practice. The more you do it, the easier it gets. Take every opportunity to practice public speaking."

The physical sensation of what some people call ""nervous""- i.e., your heart racing and butterflies in your stomach- is the exact same physical sensation as ""excitement"".      If I was feeling what some people call ""nervous"" before an audition, and someone asked me how I was doing, I'd reply, “I'm excited, THANK GOD, and am currently in the process of releasing some negative thoughts.” See, in this way, I'M the one in control.

howtonotgiveafuck,2os4ii,ashishgup,2,Wed Dec 10 00:59:02 2014 UTC,Why did you quit WoW ? Was it satisfying to play so much ? Honestly curious.
howtonotgiveafuck,2os4ii,DranDran,6,Wed Dec 10 01:55:38 2014 UTC,"Not OP, but been in OPs shoes, played WoW hardcore raiding and all that jazz for about 2-3 years when I was 30-33 years old. 30-40h a week of WoW back then seems about right on track with the time I used to put in.  Was it satisfying? Hell yes. WoW is quintessentially designed to reward your efforts. Put in enough time, and you get rewarded. You quest, you level, you get new shiny buttons to press and zones to explore. When you hit your cap, you do dungeons every day and put in enough time and you get better gear that enables you to participate effectively in raids. Do Raids and kill tough bosses, and you get gear that enables you to progress to harder raids, which they patch in every 6 months to make your latest gear obsolete.  Add to that the social element.. and you are lost. You are in this thing, with a close knit group of online buddies whom you speak to daily through VoIP, guys who have suffered with you through the toughest challenges a game can throw at you. You feel compelled to give ti all for them and see yourself through the content and it becomes your life. Its enjoyable because the highs of completing a tough challenge are satisfying. To this day, there is little, gaming wise, that compares to the first time we downed Illidan in Black Temple.  Why did I quit? Like OP, was a hermit. Gained weight till it became a health issue. Quit cold turkey, started to exercise and lost about 110 pounds within 1-2 years. In that time discovered the world has much better to offer than chasing pixel loot. There is a lot of pain too, outside your safe little WoW bubble, but I find the ups life can offer make the downs worth bearing."

howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,Thisisopposite,197,Mon Dec 8 22:55:40 2014 UTC,Another option is to only add people as friends who you actually consider decent people and those who don't stir up drama. Turn off all notifications/chat and only check it on your terms when you want to see what's going on in the lives of the people you genuinely care about. There's nothing wrong with social media when used in moderation and when you don't let it control your life by constantly browsing and with constant notifications annoying you and those around you all day long.
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,xblitzkrieg,57,Mon Dec 8 23:16:47 2014 UTC,I agree with this rather than complete abstinence. I'll add people if they add me but ill immediately turn off all feed posts from them. I use facebook to keep in touch with friends since I moved away for college and to communicate with groups I'm in on campus so deleting facebook is not ideal for me.
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,thadarkdefender,12,Mon Dec 8 23:20:22 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree. I deleted my account a few years back, but then when I graduated college, I realized there were now a ton of friends that I no longer had any contact with, I re-created my account and I use it mainly to keep in touch with former college buddies, and even some of my closest friends who have moved across country. It's really only a bad thing when people let it be, there are plenty of controls to tailor the experience to YOU."

howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,weaponboy_9,17,Tue Dec 9 13:45:01 2014 UTC,"This is why I don't care for the ""delete your FB"" drama. For one, the few times I see drama on my news feed I sit back with some popcorn and have  a laugh. It never involves me or my close family or friends. But it usually happens so rarely anyways that I'm just all talk about the popcorn thing. It's so easy to either not be friends with people or block their posts that it just doesn't make sense.   By keeping Facebook I get to see pictures of my nieces all the time. One lives an hour away and the other lives in Florida while I'm in Texas. Also, her mother does not really text to send pictures or anything so FB is my only form of getting to see my niece. I get to keep in touch with cousins that live on the other side of the country as well as friends from school that have moved away. Sure not everyone on my friend's list are people I truly care to spend time with (partly because my mother went on a huge Farmville spree a few years ago and I'm too lazy to delete people who don't bother me), but a lot of the people are people I don't mind keeping up with.   If someone is obnoxious you either go unfriend them or do the even easier thing by unfollowing them. Boom. Problem solved. I don't see deleting my entire page because a couple people are filled with drama. I don't sit on it all day, usually just when I'm bored and need something to pass the time. It's not like Reddit is much better! (Don't get me wrong! I love Reddit and spend far more time here than with my family and friends in FB land.)"
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,ashleyamdj,7,Tue Dec 9 01:02:32 2014 UTC,60% of the time I'm wasting time on reddit every time. I really only get on fb for notifications and I find that most of the crap on there is people sharing buzzfeed articles. I'll unfollow people who post those faster than people who post annoying statuses about their life's troubles.
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,thadarkdefender,1 point,Tue Dec 9 01:18:32 2014 UTC,"Exactly.  Facebook can be used for communication (chat, groups) where it's a clearly defined group of communication partners; and it can be used as a sort of self-expression (timeline, liking, sharing) where it's mostly you expressing yourself to the entire world (aka the Twitter model). I don't care for that self-expression so I don't use it that way, but I use the communicative functions all the time.   My point being, social media (like so much other technology) are what you make of them."
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,jerryFrankson,5,Tue Dec 9 20:53:16 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this! I've tried deleting my Facebook account a few times but would always have to reactivate it to use my work's Facebook page, making permanent deletion pretty much impossible. The ""Unfollow _____"" feature is my new best friend. No drama on my news feed, no drama from deleting people who I kinda have to keep as a 'friend' but whom I hate. Sweet!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,saltwaterculture-,2,Tue Dec 9 05:33:09 2014 UTC,This. See something you don't like? Unfollow that person and you will never see his/her stuff again. Plus when they try to stalk you they'll see that you're still friends and no one's feelings get hurt.

howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,redicine,-6,Tue Dec 9 09:00:42 2014 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with social media when used in moderation   No! It's all excuses to not delete the account. Fb has been designed to overpower, or at least greatly challenge, your decision making about whether to scratch that mental itch of checking the notification or not. Why would you constantly subject your willpower to such duel for supremacy? Fb is no different than smoking. If one can keep smoking in moderation, then I guess is smoking is fine too. Right? Except for a rare few, fb is just like smoking.  Try going to that step of ""delete my account"" and you will see the thousand lies your brain will tell you to keep the account alive. That is the very phenomenon smokers are well aware of while trying to quit smoking. As long as one is using facebook, there is a good possibility that they are addicted to it. They do not feel complete without it. And that is why they will not delete it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,damnrite,10,Tue Dec 9 03:21:53 2014 UTC,"Not everyone is addicted to facebook. Facebook is just a tool: it's the user who wields it that ultimately decides if it's a tool for growth or decay.  I, for one, don't have a phone. Haven't had one for months. Facebook allows me to contact people on my terms without constantly texting back and forth all day. To say that social media is the evil of our time is excusing our behavior. Some people can't live peacefully with it--for them, may it is better to delete it.    For some of us, it's not such a bad thing."

You want to be a better friend? Call them up or write them a personal email.  Or maybe you think you're that 1 in 1000. In that case, ignore me and enjoy the upvotes."

There is, a picture of my friend showering under a waterfall, a couple walking through the snow together, my friend from college is showing off a cake he made, and someone looking for a cinema buddy. In chat there's someone asking for homework help, and someone asking if I want to meet them at a restaurant later.    Meanwhile on reddit, there is clickbait, a lot of armchair experts who haven't a clue what they're talking about, lame jokes, articles that will enrage you about the state of the US even if you don't live there, posts disguising political statements and some random pics to click through.    I think my problem is Reddit, I don't use all defaults, changing it actually made it more depressing. My problem with this post is that it blindly orders everybody to do something, based on assumptions."

Sure I lost connections but I am in a much better place in life because of it. People that I went to High School with aren't doing nearly as well as I am and I think it's because I decided to follow the path less traveled and not give a fuck of what others thought about it.

It saves you from being on facebook during class or work when you actually care about what some people are doing with their lives."
howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,TrevorSlattery,0,Tue Dec 9 09:32:37 2014 UTC,"Ugh .. another one of these posts.  Look, maybe you should, maybe you shouldn't.  Either way it's a personal decision that could help or hurt.  Do you spend more time than you want on FB?  Do you look up your exes, or old friends, or whoever and pine about their lives look better than yours?  Yeah, that's not true, FB gives you the wrong impression, stop looking or delete that shit and move on.  Are you looking for social interactions?  Do you have trouble getting out sometimes?  Fighting some depression maybe?  Don't delete it, invest in it.  Stop following the people you don't want to see, or shouldn't see.  You don't have to be dramatic and unfriend them or anything.  You can if you want, but get that shit off your front page.  Soon you'll realize that there's only a handful of people you really care about, they update occasionally and you don't need to check it every 10 minutes.  More importantly, FB is a connection to people, don't delete it unless that's causing problems.  Schedule a get together, invite people over, do something.  FB is a great way to schedule an 80's Hair pub crawl, because 10 cheap wigs at a store and a night drinking with friends is fun as hell and you don't need a reason to invite all your friends (and their friends) out for a fun night.  Not your thing, that's fine, what about a board game night?  How about an event to binge watch House of Cards?    Remember, the goal isn't to not give a fuck about anything, it's about not giving a fuck when you're not supposed to give a fuck."

Basically blaming a website for their issues when those issues have existed within people long before Facebook was even a thought. Solve the actual problem and don't blame a website just because you get jealous when people post pictures of them having fun and living their life. The same thing happens if they show you those same photos on a camera or from a physical photo book too. Should we erase those from our lives too? No. Ugh, posts like this are so silly to me."

I deleted mine for a few years because I was overwhelming myself. I cared way too much about being left behind and not being as successful as my peers. It was refreshing for me to get away because I was getting lost in the made up stories in my head about other people's lives. I've read a quote somewhere about Facebook being a highlight reel. What a great perspective. A few years later, I got right with myself and I'm enjoying being social online again. I'm coming from a place of love instead of fear of inadequacy. I find I have a much harder time trying not to give a fuck about the false assumptions my brain concocts about people's intentions than I ever  have trying not to give a fuck about annoying things people do.

howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,___bateman___,0,Tue Dec 9 06:52:26 2014 UTC,"Why not get rid of your phone while you are at it? Maybe see if you can get a job from home? Then you can minimize interaction with other people and can try to keep your head in the sand about other people's happiness so you can give no fucks about what is going on outside of your head in the sand.  A person who really gives no fucks probably wouldn't even bother deleting their facebook, because that is more effort than they care to give. You know you can just not use it right? Having a profile doesn't mean you need to check it incessantly."

Being able to communicate with someone for emergency purposes is reasonable. Having a job to be able to survive is reasonable.

howtonotgiveafuck,2op043,Netprincess,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:15:18 2014 UTC,"Facebook, much like your phone, could save you in an emergency. Unlike your phone, Facebook is free. Both are just tools that you can choose to use or not.  Not everybody uses their phones in emergency only situations. Many people use it the same way as Facebook, to hear how great everybody is doing and catch their ""highlight reel"" that doesn't mean the solution is getting rid of your phone any more than the solution for facebook is to get rid of it.  The most important change has to come from within. I don't think deleting Facebook gets you any closer to that change."

Facebook could be revolutionary in small groups of people you actually care about,  if your Facebook is in a sensible state you won't get those crap wall posts and quotes of life.   Also,  for the people with the random friends that post this stuff about their life while you don't talk to them in person,  it is nice to feel like people care.

I never look to see how many friends I have or don't have, I just don't care. Facebook is incredibly useful for stuff like that. Plus, I ""like"" a few pages for space so I can somewhat keep up with it without going out of my way all the time.   I go on Reddit waaaaay more than I do Facebook. Hell, just now I was using my phone to scroll through Reddit and then opened up my computer to do something and came straight here.

Deleting it is giving a fuck. I deleted an ex girlfriend of mine and know it was evidence of how much I gave a fuck. You will just think about it. It is pretty much embedded in daily life until it gets replaced by a better social network.  I never understood the whole deleting facebook movement. It is just reddit with actual friends and acquaintances.

It doesn't matter what you did, what you wore, where you were, and what you ""advertised"" yourself as... nobody deserves to be raped.  Nobody ever, ever, ever deserves to be forced into sex they don't want or didn't consent to.   You're doing all you can right now to get past this.  It's trauma and don't marginalize yourself or think you aren't as important as any of the other rape victims in the world.  There are a lot of us.  Please just repeat to yourself that it wasn't your fault.  You never asked for it.  You never consented to it."

Sure you can say you put yourself in that position, but that does not warrant what happened to you. It's not right, ever, for a person to take advantage of another human like that. And in the same way that you might think you put yourself in that position, so did the other person. THEY knew what they were doing, THEY were conscious, THEY were aware. You were not - and you are not responsible."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oq8jz,iLiikeUnicorns,3,Sun Dec 14 08:31:52 2014 UTC,"Hi. It's not your fault. It took me a while to realise that about my own case. Had a house party when my parents were out of town, did drugs for the first time and went clubbing for the first time ever. My friends ditched me at the club and I ended up getting a ride home and got raped. I have a scar that'll forever remind me of it and I attempted suicide the day after. To make it worse, the guy turned out to be my friend's boyfriend a few days later.  I blamed myself for the past 4 years that if I'd never taken drugs this would never have happened and it was my fault. I blamed wanting to be outgoing. I blamed my friends for leaving me behind.   I blamed everyone but the fuckin person that decided to be the biggest shit that night (and it wasn't me and in your situation it wasn't you).  It's not your fault. Don't let them take up the rest of your life and mind, they don't deserve it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oq8jz,misterIIOG,2,Tue Dec 9 15:26:46 2014 UTC,"My ex girlfriend was raped more than a few times (not by me). Once in high school and God knows how many times in college. I only know of one for sure, and that alone puts a stake in my heart. I can tell you that the number one thing to NOT do is to drink. DO NOT DRINK to cover up trauma, you are only putting off those feelings for them only to come back and bite you in the ass after you hit a wall. If you want to deal with these traumas, go to a therapist. DO NOT DRINK. I can't stress that enough. Don't even smoke pot. You need a clear mind to move past these kinds of things for good. If you think you have a drinking problem and that's the only thing that makes you feel better, find a 12 step meeting. Do not drink, get some professional help, find loving people you want to be around and who can understand you. You will have to live with what's happened for the rest of your life, so it's better to deal with it sooner than later."
howtonotgiveafuck,2oq8jz,shaneOH,2,Tue Dec 9 18:29:57 2014 UTC,"It's a tough situation, that I never personally understood as well. Obviously I haven't been raped. There's just something you have to know though, and it's probably the biggest point I need to make. It happened in the past. It's not a forgivable thing no matter who you blame. Blame yourself, blame the person who raped you, it doesn't really matter. I don't think it's your fault though and you shouldn't blame yourself, but if you're bent on that idea then so be it.  Again, my point is you can't go on forever hating yourself or anyone about anything. It's not a healthy thing EVER. I mean I know it's a traumatizing experience you went through, and it's not ok. But that's why you have friends/family who care and support you when you need to talk about it as well as your doctor/therapist.   The only thing that's going to heal you though is your ability to take a breath. Look around you a bit. Are you still actively getting raped? No. Do you want to punish yourself because x amount of years ago a bad thing happened and you wouldn't let yourself move on?   The whole point here is you're ok now, at least physically. You can still have friends, family, a healthy body, education, shelter, laughs and fun times. No one is asking you to forget what happened but don't let it consume your existence.   Are you going to let the fact that you were raped x amount of years ago RUIN the rest of your life? TAKE your life? That's letting your troubles completely win. Rape isn't something you get over and move on from, it's something you cope with and continue on living. I mean I know it's a bit of an extreme example and maybe harsh, but it's the viewpoint. Are you going to be mad at your parents for the rest of your life because they put you in time out as a kid? Would you let that one moment in your life completely fuck up the relationship you had with your parents for the remainder of your life? Even 2 years of it? 1 year? Isn't a week even a bit extreme? If you blame yourself, forgive yourself. It happened, all the wrist cutting in the world can't send you back in time. Let it make you stronger, your experiences. a hard time can either shape you or break you. You almost let it break you and it's going to break you if you can't just breathe for a second, look at yourself and say you are ok. It happened, and now you are ok. You don't have to forget about the situation and honestly if you can remember who did it, damn you should get that guy in jail. Just don't let it break you."

howtonotgiveafuck,2oq8jz,Y6Y1Y9,-1,Wed Dec 10 10:07:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah no dude. I'm going to be harsh with you. You are dumb for thinking it's your fault. Rape is the rapists fault no matter what life style you lead. The literal definition of rape is someone else forcing sex on you without your consent. The lifestyle or image you portray is not relevant in that equation what so ever. This is a hard and objective fact. You are not at fault no matter how much you party or how much CONSENSUAL sex you have with strangers. This does not give any one permission to drug and rape you. End of story. If you'd chose to be someone else and portray some other image, you could have still been raped. All it takes is someone else choosing to put forth the effort to drug a drink (which doesn't have to be alcoholic) and carrying you off somewhere. So just because you chose to portray the partier doesn't make it your fault. Literally, the only way the rape could have been your fault is if you walked up to the person and asked them to rape you. Which would make it consensual and it would not be rape. Rape is literally never the victims fault. Ever. Period. No matter what revealing clothes they wear or self image they portray. Do you understand?"

howtonotgiveafuck,2opin9,crackerjack4294,20,Tue Dec 9 01:37:21 2014 UTC,"""You think she's the one that got away...until you meet the next one""  I found that quote on this sub and it really stood out to me from all the other advice. There's no point getting hung up on the past--you'll miss out on what is right in front of you. Live in the moment. Things will still remind you of that broken relationship but eventually it won't hurt anymore. Time really does heal all wounds. You'll never recapture the feelings you felt in your first serious relationship but the next relationship will be special in its own way.  Also remember that you must love yourself before you seek out others to love you back again. Breakups can really mess you up mentally. It might take awhile to accept yourself as an individual after identifing as a couple for so long. Don't rush into another relationship if you arent ready. Nobody wants to be with someone who hates life or hates themselves...that isn't desirable.  Relationships are hard. If youre having trouble finding/staying in a healthy relationship, take a break and experience everything else life has to offer! Hope this helps"

howtonotgiveafuck,2opin9,somerandomguy16,9,Wed Dec 10 01:41:09 2014 UTC,"I don't know if this is completely relevant/is what you're asking, but I decided about two years ago that I wasn't going to open myself up to the pain that comes from rejections, breakups, etc.  So I started setting goals for myself, focused on my job, and decided that I wasn't going to pursue anyone anymore.  I have reinvested that energy, and now have a great job, make more money than I've ever made before, and have a list of personal, financial, and travel goals.  I'm going to do what I want, and see the world because I want to, and I am not going to let others decide my happiness."
howtonotgiveafuck,2opin9,somerandomguy16,2,Tue Dec 9 21:25:56 2014 UTC,So the avenue that you took was in essence a shutdown of relationships and their problems? I don't mean for that to sound harsh I am just wondering what you do.
howtonotgiveafuck,2opin9,somerandomguy16,3,Wed Dec 10 02:17:14 2014 UTC,"I didn't take it in a harsh way at all.  Basically, yes.  But not in an extreme sense.  I'm not actively looking to date anyone; and if someone is interested,  I usually will decline.  I've just found that when I try to pursue a relationship, it usually ends badly.  And I don't mean ""oh she said no"" badly.  The last 3 relationships I've had I've been cheated on, I've been left in the middle of the night w/no explanation, and then been left me for another man.  So I just reevaluated what was important to me.  Right now, relationships aren't.  Maybe one day I'll meet someone who will give me pause and cause me to reevaluate my views on a relationship. But in no longer actively pursing relationships, I've been able to reinvest that time into other things that I wanted to do just for me, not anyone else."
howtonotgiveafuck,2opin9,smellslikecatsfarts,3,Wed Dec 10 02:31:57 2014 UTC,If I could figure out how to find such mental strength to stay away from relationships and sex that would be so amazing hah  But you are saying if someone came along that made you reevaluate what importance relationships were in your life then you would pursue that?

I was too disturbed by it. Last night I thought a lot about my relationship with her after I got that wonderful comment by someone above and then I felt like she is one of the best partners I could ever find. I'm failing to see her as a person completely. I think I will work on being more confident and not to think her solely physically. I should try to see her as a human overall.   I have been raised by abusive father so I always judge myself (how I act stupid and have low confidence too)and try to validate myself from others. I think I need to work on raising my confidence and this very stupid reason of perception of others will look futile to me.

howtonotgiveafuck,2oi9r2,GSV-Culture,11,Sun Dec 7 19:53:11 2014 UTC,"Are you me? Seriously, this totally describes the last few months of my life. I've been working retail, and started noticing this pattern in me.  For me, the experience is actually rather physical. It's hard to describe, but I noticed that I was always ""scanning"" everyone around me, trying to read them in order to feel safe expressing myself. It's like I wasn't actually living in my own body! I was in my head and outside myself, always calculating, reacting and anticipating.   The second I gained this awareness, I realized there was another choice. I let go of everything around me and it was like I ""poured"" back into my own body. It was weird. It was suddenly like being blind in a way, but I didn't care, because what other people were thinking and feeling didn't threaten me anymore. The feelings of need and lack in me vanished. It was disorienting, but so comforting and balancing at the same time.   It will take time. I still go back and forth. It's an old, ingrained habit. I've spent a lot of time alone lately, sort of like meditating. Even 20 minutes here or there is helpful to be able to just settle, let go and find that center in myself again. Sometimes finding that connection is easy and sometimes it's elusive. It slowly gets stronger and more consistent. I'm seeing situations more clearly, defining my true needs, understanding where I can give and where I have to honor my limits. It's amazing to see that other people are having the same experience!"

howtonotgiveafuck,2oi9r2,TC10284,4,Sun Dec 7 20:39:07 2014 UTC,I think what makes it so hard for most of us is not that we don't know that we shouldn't be people pleasers. We've all heard exactly what we should do and understand it on an intellectual level but can't seem to emotionally recognize that behaving this way is detrimental to our happiness. As in realIzing that we can't please everyone doesn't stop us from being afraid moment to moment of how people will react to what we say. Maybe we should all spend some time in retail so that we actually see it for ourselves...

It sounds to me that he/she is at an age where they're starting to discover who they are as a person -- their likes and dislikes, their temperament, etc. -- and that it's okay to be who they are without having to apologize for what may set them apart from the crowd.  By calling them a dick, you sound like the crowd that's pressuring them. Try to cultivate some sensitivity."

OP never said exactly how that crowd addressed him/her.   I am being sensitive to OP's needs, which is why I dropped the dick-bomb. You can't always accomplish what you need to by being exclusively gentle and kind with people, sometimes you have to call them on their shit so they know just how it looks to outsiders.  I'm giving OP the gift of my honest perspective. Not to be an asshole, but because OP seems like he/she legitimately needs one to help reformulate his or her views."

A guy jumped me with his friends on a night out, and I'm not normally the kind of person who would fight. After getting a bottle smashed over my head from behind I turned around on some crazy adrenaline rush and proceeded to fight him even though 3 of his friends were hitting me. Thinking it through after I knew it was bad because I knew the guy carried a knife and having bottled me would've easily used it given the chance. (He was in my class in school, and this was the year we'd finished.) The smart thing would have been to run ASAP since I was alone but instead here I am in the middle of four people, still hitting him when my friends started running to get there and help, and the four turned and ran.

howtonotgiveafuck,2oemzl,Phelanthropy,2,Sat Dec 6 13:01:50 2014 UTC,"Nearest match for hitchens' razor is  Hitchens's razor:       Hitchens's razor is an epistemological razor which asserts that the onus (burden of proof) in a debate lies with whoever makes the (greater) claim; if this burden is not then met, the claim is unfounded and its opponents do not need to argue against it. It is named, echoing Occam's razor, for the journalist and writer Christopher Hitchens, who, in 2003, formulated it thus:   ""What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.""  Hitchens's razor is actually a translation of the Latin proverb ""Quod gratis asseritur, gratis negatur"",  which has been widely used at least since the early 19th century,  but Hitchens's English rendering of the phrase has made it more widely known in the 21st century. It is used, for example, to counter presuppositional apologetics. This quotation appears by itself in God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything, a book by Hitchens in 2007.   Writer Richard Dawkins, also an atheist, formulated a different version of the same law, at a TED conference in February 2002:  ""The onus is on you to say why, the onus is not on the rest of us to say why not.""  Dawkins used his version to argue against agnosticism, which he described as ""poor"" in comparison to atheism,  because it refuses to judge on claims that are, even though not wholly falsifiable, very unlikely to be true.

Then one of them tells me to give him my watch. I loved that watch and told him flat out no. He pulled a knife and started screaming and I said to him that he was going to have to stab me for the watch (It was a basic timex watch, nothing fancy) and he punched me in the head a few times but I kept my hand over my watch and repeated ""you are not getting the watch"" then he gave up and they ran away.

I said no just do it here, he says no just come with me.   So I tell my friend this is stupid lets just go, but he thinks it will fine. So he follows the guy and I am standing there thinking ""This isn't going to go well"" and then we get into this back alley and he says to keep going, into the really dark area where there are a few other people standing around. My friend walked into said dark area with the guy and I'm like fuck..  So sure enough in this back alley about 5 or so of this guys friends come rushing over, 3 of them are on me shouting to give them my wallet, meanwhile my friend already handed over his cash and then they all turn their attention on me and the rest is like I already said.

These people are out there every day trying this shit, if they killed everyone who put up resistance they wouldn't last long."

Your average street thug commits a crime because he knows he has the power and the upper hand. If you take that away from him, or in any way make him doubt that he's the one in charge, 9 times out of 10 they'll turn tail. Crap like that is why Concealed Carry is a good idea. Being on the business end of a gun makes anyone re-evaluate their life choices, regardless of if they're the instigator or not.  That said, there's always that one time that things will go wrong, and someone will end up hurt or killed. It's always better to err on the side of caution, but if you're forced into a fight or die situation, don't afraid to throw some proverbial punches.

His lack of quality is going to hurt your business reputation in the long term?  Then, sorry.... nope. No free passes. This is your deal and you need to fucking OWN it like a BOSS.  Either you have to change your standards and structure to include rules regarding quality and then enforce them or he has to go and you find someone who does care intrinsically.  Or, well.... BOTH  Because  then you can enforce quality across everyone.... now and forever.  So for example:  ""You get paid piecework. A piece only counts if it meets the following quality requirements:   Proper number of nails <blah blah> Proper placement of nails <blah blah> Correct alignment of shingles <blah blah> ..... you fill in the rest.....""   You inspect everything. Any work that does not meet those standards... the worker does not get paid for it.  So, he could in theory.... work an entire day, but if he does shit work... he doesn't get paid. (barring any legal minimum rules in your location).

howtonotgiveafuck,2o4fvo,itsthumper,12,Wed Dec 3 17:51:59 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think this is not such good advice.  Getting hit in the face, get a black eye, quit your job and find another one on a whim is not solid advise to help you progress but rather end up worse than when you started. The general advise is good - Don't like it, change it but honest to god I hope people don't get a Hollywood romantic comedy out of this and follow it to a T. You sound like a very impulsive person, who's to say you would have liked the new project?  I'm not criticizing you because I would have done the same thing, anyway. I'm that impulsive, hell I moved countries a couple months ago - to a country I hadn't been yet, to a new job I didn't work in before, didn't speak the language, didn't even know where it was exactly located on the map - for a girl I had been dating for 3 months. Is that crazy? Absolutely yes, would I recommend it to someone else, absolutely no, am I happy - I've never felt happier in my life.   But that's not to say everything will always be butterflies if you do crazy things like that, without the odds being in your favor. Things can turn very wrong, and you need a certain basis of self-worth and confidence before jumping into the void like that, which sometimes needs to be introduced gradually rather than just jump into it.  Live your life, take your own decisions, jump into voids - Just have some brain to it. Life is not a movie, and remember that doing crazy things and not giving a fuck is the best thing in life - But you need lucidity to balance along with it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2o4fvo,yarr_be_my_password,4,Wed Dec 3 09:23:44 2014 UTC,"I agree. I wasn't trying to frame this as advice as much as expressing my joy in not giving a fuck. This very well might end up being a terrible decision (for a little while), but it has certainly kicked me in the ass and pushed me to pursue something better, with a sense of urgency, which is something I was missing when I just accepted the first thing that came along. Maybe I'll wish I didn't do it, but I believe I won't.  Thanks for the helpful disclaimer though... and a good piece of advice."

howtonotgiveafuck,2o4fvo,Pugovitz,2,Wed Dec 3 12:05:53 2014 UTC,I would have interviewed and waited to get a new job first before leaving.  This is kind of reckless. But I guess how to not give a fuck is a fine line between reckless and self empowerment.
howtonotgiveafuck,2o4fvo,Pugovitz,2,Wed Dec 3 16:52:52 2014 UTC,"I've been feeling the exact same about my job. A friend got me the position a few months ago and it just hasn't felt right the whole time I've been here. The fact that I got it through a friend doesn't bother me much, but I just feel like the job's not a good match for me. I definitely don't want to dedicated 11 hours of every day to it for the foreseeable future. It pays pretty well though, and I've spent the last year being rather poor and destitute, so I know I can't just leave without something else lined up. The problem is, I'm so tired (mentally more than physically) when I get home that I have no energy to look for something better. Also, I have no fucking clue what ""better"" is."
howtonotgiveafuck,2o4fvo,numpad,2,Wed Dec 3 16:28:25 2014 UTC,"I've felt like this for longer than I can remember. And it's the reason why I just cut myself out of this situation. For me it's a vicious cycle... the more mentally drained I become, the less clearly I can see, the less optimism I  have, the more depressed I become, the more mentally drained i become... This time I felt like the only way to find out what better is was to throw myself into a situation where I had to find out, and stop the cycle. So that's what I'm doing now.   As someone pointed out, I'm a pretty impulsive person. I get bored easily if I don't care about what I'm doing... But if I do, I will devote myself fully to it. I've come to realize this about myself as time goes on, and as I get older I am recognizing faster what I don't like and need to separate myself from. I'm done sinking into negative spirals, and now I'm hunting the good ones. I've been hovering around $0 for some time now, and for that reason this was a rather difficult decision for me to make. But for better or worse, I think that urgency will help me move forward with strength and conviction."

Six months ago my wife told me she was leaving me and didn't want to make any attempt to fix the situation. I was completely blindsided and had absolutely no idea it was coming.    Six months ago my wife told me she was leaving me and didn't want to make any attempt to fix it. While I wasn't blindsided, it devastated me because I think anything is fixable. And we have 2 kids.   I'm in the midst of a severe identity crisis. I'm pushing 40 and for the last 10 years of my life I've identified myself as a husband and a teacher, and now I'm neither. I'm living in a friend's extra bedroom, completely broke, unable to find work for months (fuck you McGuinty government, incidentally), and at times feeling devastatingly alone.   Perfect fucking time to hit the reset and start giving a fuck about the next, better phase of you life. You have no kids, no ties to where you are, no ties to who you were. Phase 2..engage!   Two weeks ago I found out one of my dogs (two dogs and two cats went with my wife) had been missing for almost two weeks, and then a day later she called to tell me that hunters had found her body. My life is a country song.   Deepest sympathies. I got to keep the dog so I have that.   One small step at a time, I guess. Some days it's just hard not to give a fuck.   Again, give a fuck. The best thing for me was having a face-to-face with myself. Accept the new reality, decide what I wanted, made a plan and started moving forward.Once you let go of what was you can embrace what will be.  PM me anytime if you want.

My problem at this point has been, as you said, deciding what I want, making a plan and moving forward. I've spent the last 6 months trying to figure that out and I haven't been able to. I have absolutely no idea what I want. I'm no closer to figuring it out than I was 6 months ago when the shit hit the fan. Well, other than wanting a time machine to go back 5 years and solve the problem before it became a colossal cluster-fuck. Right now I'm at a crossroads, but I can't read the signs and it's becoming overwhelmingly frustrating and demoralizing.  But at least some days I can not give a fuck what anyone else thinks and do what feels right. It's a start I guess."

I dropped, couldn't quite stay on my feet, and faceplanted, except I didn't really faceplant, somehow I managed to do a roll and come up on my feet. Nobody saw it, and I was really sad."

The other day I was longboarding down a gnarly hill and did a toeslide (a slide where your back faces the direction you're moving) and my board got caught and I fell backwards (as in about to nail my head on the concrete kind of backwards) at about 15 mph.

Trans peoples genders are deeply important to their identities, and preferences in pronouns are more than just words - they represent how society views them, understands them, and expects them to behave. These are issues that trans people often struggle with all the time, and they have a right to feel hurt and invalidated when their wishes aren't respected. A response that is more or less 'get over it and stop caring so much' unintentionally invalidates their feelings. In retrospect, this is probably not the right subreddit for OP"

Worst case scenario; you're 13. you've felt this way for a year.   you have had to put up with being misgendered a MAXIMUM of 7.7% of your life. If this trend continues, you will have to deal with a total of roughly a bit less that 1 month of bullshit, per year, for the rest of your life. Most people would kill for that kind of relief. That's not that bad.  Girl, you're dealing with a struggle, and it's making you stronger. I'm 29. I was never transgenger. But being a teenager was bullshit. Give it a bit longer, see what you learn. At WORST you're only 25% of your way through life. There's cool people out there to meet. Awesome stuff to see. Hang in there.  Also, don't sweat little things. Even if they seem big now. Someone misgendering you is no different to someone mispronouncing your name. It happens, who cares? you know who you are, at some point you don't have to bother correcting people.

howtonotgiveafuck,2nz1ek,synapticimpact,9,Mon Dec 1 21:50:24 2014 UTC,"the only way i ever found to successful deal with dysphoria is to be proactive - to know that every day i am making steps towards being completely me. 2 years HRT and thats still the case - i get misgendered once in a while and it still stings, but I just keep plugging along.   a few tips to finding ways to deal with the problem - 1) get into therapy now. do your research and find a trans-friendly therapist near you. if your mum wont listen to your trans issues, tell her you're depressed, or suicidal, and that you really think therapy will help you get over that and this therapist has been recommended to you by some close friends who were also struggling. or go through your dad. or your school. or find a local drop in place for teens (here in Australia we have a service called headspace). Puberty blockers are a thing and the earlier you start the better.   2) start working out every day. take control of your body and be proud of the things that it can do. you can focus on the more feminine training styles like dance, yoga or pilates too if you cant stand being around the men in the weight room.  3) surround yourself with allies, whether they be cis, straight, trans, queer, whatever. people who will use your correct name and preferred pronoun in public and call out people who dont. people who will have your back when you need to use the restroom. stay building your safe spaces."

howtonotgiveafuck,2nz1ek,thepeoplespritchard,6,Mon Dec 1 22:29:30 2014 UTC,"my advise to you is to just try toughing it out for a little longer. I know that that may seem like a shitty thing to say, but there really isn't much more you can do other that continue being strong. you just need to realize that teenagers are a bunch of ignorant, irrational pieces of shit that don't try to even bother understanding issues like this.   the biggest problem for Trans people is that people misunderstand what it really is to be transgender/transsexual. to many people, they think that you ""think"" that you are a girl, but what they don't understand is that sex is not gender. I can understand where these peoples' thinking comes from, given that the issue of gender identity can sometimes be hard to understand for cis people.   if you want people to understand you, you should really try sitting down with them and educating them. just tell them that, although you have the body of a boy, your brain is wired as a girl, and that what your brain says overrides what your body says."

howtonotgiveafuck,2nz1ek,therealseabass,3,Tue Dec 2 06:47:54 2014 UTC,"I don't have enough time for a post long enough to warrant such an important question, but one piece of advice from a fellow trans person that is constantly misgendered: Politely correct them. Lots of people who are misgendering you want to be helpful and supportive of you, but they don't know better.    If they aren't respectful and supportive of you, then you need to do your best to remove them from your life. It doesn't matter if they were your best friend before you transitioned - you need to surround yourself with people who accept you and love you for who you are. That's really hard to do in high school for a variety of reasons boiling down to being a victim of circumstance - but do what you can.    And on that point, it gets better. SO SO SO MUCH BETTER. Once you're more independent, you can look into HRT on your own, you have far more control over the people that you hang out with, the area of the country that you live in, and people in general are more respectful and knowledgeable about trans issues as they age and become more mature.    And one more thing: Look into the Trevor Project. It's a national 24-hour suicide/support hotline specifically for LGBTQ youth. Their hotline is 1-866-488-7386, and if you go to their website you can even talk to someone through texting and chatting."
howtonotgiveafuck,2nz1ek,Bowtiesarecoo1,2,Tue Dec 2 11:51:49 2014 UTC,"One other thing: Plan for the future, and plan for making it turn out your way. At some point you may need to get out on your own or to pay for things you need out of your own pocket. So get a job when you can and put your money away in your own bank account. The more you have saved up , the more you will feel you have a way to go forward on your own."

I ask because in some states, you can legally get medical treatment as a minor as a transteen.  I know that in Oregon, you can get hormone treatment at 16.  Check out the ACLU's Know Your Transgender Rights to see what it is for your state.  I really feel for you.  I have a transgender daughter.  She just came out a couple months ago and it's sooooo hard to see her struggle with people still seeing her as male, regardless of all the brave steps she's taken to come out.  I love her fearlessness in embracing who she is, but it's also terrifying to watch because people's reactions are all over the place.  She's 15.  She's far enough into puberty that hormone blockers don't really make a difference anymore.  Her voice has changed and her hair is short so clothes don't really make much of a difference just yet.  I think that as she becomes more comfortable presenting as female, that she may get more people referring to her with feminine pronouns, but I don't know.  So hopefully, for you, it's a phase and people will ultimately adjust.  It's what I'm really hoping for with my daughter."

And at that age, puberty hadn't given me a very masculine body yet, so there wasn't much for people to decipher from, and at the time, it really was still just girls that had long hair (in Texas).  I'd go to a public bathroom and all kinds of guys would look at me and ask, ""Shouldn't you be in the women's?"", some serious, some being asses.   It happened enough where I could learn the difference between people who were serious and who were being douche bags. I just let it go if they were confused, and just gave a dirty look and a firm ""no"" to the dicks.  Now I'm 6'0, have facial hair, and I shit you not it still happens about once a week.

The beginning of the transition is the hardest. My friend experienced harassment due to his (FTM) ambiguous gender. He dropped out of school temporarily to get top surgery and continue hormone therapy and came back to school a passing male. His parents were and are supportive. What got them on board was a book about transgenderism (is that a word?) that the mom and child both found similar to their life experiences. So find literature (online or otherwise) to help bring your parents on board with how you're feeling and always have felt. Second, go to a gender-specialized therapist/psychologist/psychiatrist. They are trained professionals to recognize patterns of non-cis gender identities. If literature doesn't help your parents, maybe talking to a therapist with you would help them. Then lastly, depending on your parents, hormone therapy helps a lot of transgender people pass which gives them more confidence in their appearances. Young children to old adults, people have started hormone therapy at all ages. Your life is a unique and challenging experience but you deserve happiness in this world."

Read lots of books, both fiction and non-fiction about everything that interests you - particularly about being trans. Arm yourself with information and knowledge. I also recommend joining trans-friendly organizations to meet others who share your experiences.  Have a plan. You're still a teenager, so be a teenager for now. Smell the roses, so-to-speak. You probably aren't in a financial or social position at this point to live your life quite the way you'd like to. Write down your ultimate goals and map it backwards from there. Again, do your research. You have the knowledge, you have a plan. Aside from the obvious ""Put it into action,"" you need to know how to not give a fuck. There isn't going to be a quick fix for this. Again, research. There are links in the sidebar which may be a good place to start.    Stay happy, stay healthy, and stay safe. The last bit of advice I would like to give is to prune toxic people from your life. If someone is holding you back or down, don't keep them around. I wish you the very best, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to give you a quick solution. I don't think one exists...  Suicide is not a solution since you cannot change your mind on once you go through with it. A solution has to be tweakable in order to adapt to new changes that Time ultimately brings. There are always other options; you won't know what those other options are until you look for them. Research!"

Stop identifying yourself with gender altogether. It's about as useful as identifying yourself with the colour of your skin. Why do you need anyone other than yourself to know who you are? You have nothing to prove. You're fine the way you are, and no one needs to recognize that for it to be true, it just is.  I would very likely be classified as a heterosexal male, but if someone were to refer to me as she, it, a homosexual, a vegetable, a reptilian, a ghost, whatever, then fine. If they find such labels useful, then that is their thing.  Just be, don't make a big deal out of it.  edit: Whoa, whoa. There seems to be a lot of fucks given regarding identity here.

howtonotgiveafuck,2ns1p9,AptCasaNova,1 point,Sun Nov 30 11:57:33 2014 UTC,"People don't care if you talk loudly in an apropriate situation. In a one on one conversation, you can be more quiet, but it is  important that when you say something you want the people around you to hear, you say it loud enough for everyone to hear. We can't change our voices, so why worry about it. the people you know and love, already don't give a fuck, so you are probably okay. If someone is superficial enough to judge you for it, they probably aren't worth having around anyways.  You will never see or speak to people on the bus again most likely. No one cares. they just want to get where they are going.Whenever I travel alone I tune out everything until I arrive. We as people are too tied up in our own days to worry about what some stranger says on the bus.  I got tired of being asked to repeat things so I changed the way I talk. It was a process, but it got easier. People will also judge you depending on how you say things, but that's more of a subtle thing. say things with confidence rather than making a statement into half a question. watch your inflections and mannerisms and you should be okay.  Edit: A big thing that helped me with my anxiety about speaking up was attending toastmasters, and reading books on the subject. Toastmasters will coach you on how to give a speech, but it is also practical for talking in a group. Most people have no problems with one on one communication, but speaking to multiple people is a different set of skills."

I know a few people at work in senior positions who don't speak loudly, but they employ other methods like the ones I mentioned and can get people's attention almost as well and are well-respected.  The only time you really need to worry about being loud is in a large group or in front of a crowd.  If you aren't sure about how well your voice is being projected, gesture towards the back and ask if they can hear you, while cupping your ear."

howtonotgiveafuck,2nmvrg,THETONYG,7,Fri Nov 28 03:32:17 2014 UTC,"I could never get past the overly religious messaging in The Power of Positive Thinking by Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Heard this book recommended many times, but I zoned out after the first chapter..."
howtonotgiveafuck,2nmvrg,ObiTwoKenobi,14,Fri Nov 28 10:22:56 2014 UTC,"I considered it to be more spiritual than religious.  One of my co-workers brought up Jesus the other day at work.  Another one replied, ""I'm not even religious so I'm not going to say anything.""  And I said, ""But the point of Jesus and the Bible is not to be religious.  Anyone can benefit from the principles laid out in the Bible.  The point is to consider how Jesus lived his life and determine if any of his teachings benefit your own life.""  You don't have to follow all of the teachings and rules of Christianity.  Hell, you don't have to follow any of them religiously.  But spiritually, if you have an open mind, and just try it, you may benefit.  At the core of Bruce Lee's philosophy was to ""Adapt what is useful. Reject what is useless. Add what is uniquely your own.""   Without an open mind, though, and at least giving new information a chance, what you adapt is going to be more narrow than what it could be.  I'm not trying to get at you personally.  I'm just saying.  edit: tl;dr - Adapt what is useful. Reject what is useless. Add what is uniquely your own."
howtonotgiveafuck,2nmvrg,ObiTwoKenobi,2,Fri Nov 28 12:59:02 2014 UTC,Great points! I'll give it another shot.  The Alchemist had similar religious messaging and I was able to really enjoy that one

I'd say that Paulo Coelho's main message is teaching faith and hope, though there is a fine line between those two words.  It just wasn't in a very practical way.  Paulo Coelho teaches through literature, and fantasy, and fiction.  Although religion and spirituality can also be considered fiction, many of the teachings apply directly to ways of living/thinking/acting that can be USED in a very concrete way.  For example, treat others the way you wish to be treated.  One can see how that can be practiced as a habit in day-to-day interaction.  However, 'never giving up hope', which is a constant reminder in The Alchemist is a little more vague and Coelho leaves it up to the imagination."

Focus on what matters: what type of person you are, how you treat others, your grades, your interests, etc. These are the only things that will endure beyond the four years of high school.

As for having sex, you're 15. Nothing to be ashamed of for still being a virgin. You're probably honestly better off for now not dealing with the drama and risks that come with it. I hate to sound like my mom when i say this, but you won't ever regret waiting for the right first person. You'll never forget who they were.

I've been in your situation several times and can only recommend that you start looking for work IMMEDIATELY. It does feel great to be able to do whatever you feel like with adequate rest every day but the unfortunate truth is that you must make money. First of all, take a second to imagine being forced to go back to a similar job to the one you just quit because you have no money and need to pay the bills. Truly imagine how that would affect your mental well being. It's akin to being a slave and I've been there many times. At the very least try out some other lines of work (maybe construction if you don't like sitting all day?), but do it now before the money runs out. Remember, often it takes weeks or months of time just to go through the application process for a new job, and that's if you find a suitable one at all, so don't wait until you need a job in the next week or two.

When I think about the idea of being forced to go back to a job, I can't even imagine how that would happen. Who would physically force me to go back. If, at any time, I go back to a job (which is very possible, but unimportant), it will be by my own decision. At that point, the decision may be die starving in the streets, or work at a job and be a slave, but it will still be a choice that I consciously make."

Giving a fuck about your financial future is something you need to think about especially if you like the freedom you have, temporarily, now.

Oh, what am i driveling, so those LSD trips. It wasnt much, but in LSD it was so much. With my friend i went trough the things i have pondered normally and realistically. The point was that humans are simply intelligent animals, thats it. We can think whatever we want, but we're still animals and we have needs. This world has been build around money and religions and we are blindly following it. I've known this when im sober, but in LSD.

Although a bit long winded at the start, if you get to the meat in the middle it's a good point to consider. Are you taking your ""don't walk all over me"" attitude too far?    Self reflection is key. Does the problem lie within you or without? Adjust accordingly :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,2ndfb6,brick_eater,19,Tue Nov 25 21:07:22 2014 UTC,"Ok dude so I've had experience of exactly this before. I'm in a bit of a rush so I don't have time to explain this perfectly but I hope you get the general ideas.  I'll get to my personal experience in a minute though, first I need to tell you about my theory on 'friendship groups' that goes like this. This tends to apply to friendship groups where you see the others most if not every day in the week. When everyone meets initially, say when you're starting university and people in your hall of residence are meeting each other for the first time, nobody knows anything about anybody else. What happens is over the coming weeks, friendship groups start to form, which tend to become fairly concrete within a few months. In the formation of these friendship groups, however, people often end up assuming certain 'roles' within the group. For example, there will be some in the group who are the most 'popular', have the most friends from other groups, have the most sex etc. The group might also have its 'token funny guy(s)/girl(s)'. And, if the friendship group is big enough, and if it has quite a few 'lads' (UK) / 'bros' (US), there will often be the 'token pushover'. What often happens is that after enough time has passed, people have assumed their 'roles' within the group, and importantly, there's often a sort of unconscious desire for the status quo to be maintained. People don't tend to like it when the 'pushover' of the group tries, over a short period, to assert himself as being a no-bullshit 'leader' type figure.  Obviously, this isn't the ideal way a friendship group should work. However, it often turns out this way. Sometimes if you end up spending too much time with the same group, you end up just getting annoyed at each other and more of an aggressive atmosphere begins to develop.  Why should you listen to me? Because for a few months at the start of this year, I was, in a way the token pushover in one of my friendship group. What happened was, for whatever reason, the group was becoming more internally aggressive. There was more ""banter""; more ""lad/bro humour"". It got to the point where I was so pissed off at being the whipping boy that I decided to make some dramatic changes to my personality. Got into some crazy self-devleopment shit which changed my character a lot over the course of several weeks.   Now, I know exactly what you mean about people getting angry with you trying to not be a pushover any more. In a way, they were right to get angry, because I was getting pretty douchey at times. Some of the self-development stuff I'd employed changed me during that time for the better - I became way more driven, focused, disciplined. But the problem was, I also ended up becoming kind of a dick. I bought into the whole 'alpha-male' type philosophy. I said some pretty hurtful things about feminism to one of my sensitive friends who is really passionate about it. In essence, I let the 'no-more-mr-nice-guy' thing go too far, to the point where I wasn't a very nice person any more (in a bad way).  Now, if you're happy with your 'no more mr nice guy' attitude, and it truly reflects the best side of your personality, then by all means carry on with it. You don't have to drop it. However, you need to really question why it is you feel you had to adopt that personality change in the first place. If you find that in your social circles, you're constantly having to be asserting yourself, people are very judgemental and take the piss out of the 'weaker' one on a continual basis, you need to ask yourself: am I hanging around with the best people?  The fact that you decided to stop a year ago a year ago and people still haven't adjusted to it does seem a bit strange. You can keep your current friends, not suggesting you ditch them. But maybe it's time to start hanging out with some new people as well, people you've never spoken to before. If you introduce yourself and make it clear that you're not a pushover from the start (without being a dick, you don't have to be that assertive), then they probably won't treat you like one.  An alternate route you can try is just try looking for people who you feel really comfortable around. People you don't have to prove that you're a really 'hard', 'no-more-mr-nice-guy' kinda guy to. I'm not suggesting you revert to being a pushover! But perhaps toning back your assertiveness in another friendship group would allow you to feel most at home. This is sort of what happened to me - I left my university halls and am now living in a house with 7 of my closest friends from the first year. The 'lad/bro' atmosphere has dissolved and we're all just more real with each other. So I feel I can be myself more now.  I'm by no means a social expert/really popular but I'm more comfortable in myself than I was a few months ago, I feel I've made some progress.   Maybe your situation differs from mine in significant ways. It seemed quite similar though so I hope this is useful advice. :)  EDIT: Thanks for the gold!"

howtonotgiveafuck,2ndfb6,codinghermit,4,Tue Nov 25 16:28:31 2014 UTC,"Think about it this way...   It's like they're thinking ""Did he just say no to me?! He can't say no. Not him!""   Anyone who would get mad at you for not going out of your way to help them is probably only using you in general.   These kinds of people are sometimes good acquaintances but don't confuse them for friends. These people will suck you dry and once they don't see a use for you anymore, you will see their true side and be worse off for it. Like /u/AliceA said   Think of this as a process wherein you are eliminating all the negatives from your life and soon there will be room for positive people.   Once the ""leech friends"" figure out they can't keep using you and start to drift away, all you are left with is your true friends and room in your social circle for more.   Will this social turbulence settle down over time?   Sort of. There is probably always going to be turbulence with the leech friends but once they start to go away, there will be less turbulence overall since you are just left with your real buddies.   How do I handle being disliked by people just because I'm not a pushover?   The answer is kind of in the question. Do you really care what people who feel that way think? They are pretty shallow people and in the end, you will have a much easier time of life since you will have real friendships to depend on when times get tough.   I know that's kinda stupid to say ""just don't care"" but really, there's no reason their opinion should matter to you at all."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ndfb6,junkk,2,Tue Nov 25 16:28:49 2014 UTC,"Saying no is so powerful because nobody does it. The natural reaction when someone says no is to assume that something is wrong or that they don't care about you and your problems. Many people will likely respond this way when you don't let them walk over you. This is not a problem of yours, but of theirs.   If they want someone to walk over, they can find someone else. Part of NGAF is truly being okay if they decide they would rather find a pushover to be friends with. There are good people out there, and the only way to find them is to let go of all the not-so-good people that are taking up their spot in your life.  Good luck, my friend. I'm here if you need to talk. Namaste :D"

I simply made a mental note to think more about myself and don't care about the consequences if I say no to when a coworker asks me to cover for him for no particular reason.  This happens pretty much everywhere and as brick_eater mentioned, it's the role I'm assigned when I meet new people. I don't know what I'm doing to be marked as the pushover target. Because I'm certainly not letting it happen, but people keep trying.  Also, I'm doing my best to say no in a semi polite manner. But I'm not making up stories to get away either. Usually it's something like ""No, I'm sure you can handle that without my help"". Because when people do ask me for help, it's usually just to have something take up less time or to offload some of the work. It's not like my help is required (usually)."

Two are in their 70s, 40+ years after removal.  It's very common surgery, taking a few days to a couple of weeks before fully resuming normal activity.  The most difficult part after surgery is being careful about high-fat meals, as these tend to cause diarrhea in many people.  Some people experience absolutely no ill effects.  If you aren't experiencing infections or painful attacks, you might ask your doctor if trying drug therapy would be helpful.  That could provide enough relief to make surgery unnecessary."

Playing it safe for some fleeting sense of comfort is not truly living. In ancient myths they always said that the gods envied the mortals. The lives of mortals were far more beautiful than the gods could ever be. Why? Because the mortals had to face their own death. The imperfection of mortals is what made them more beautiful than the gods could ever be. You found your courage today. But this is just the first step to a brand new life. The fears won't go away. Neither will all the imperfections. But if you continue to nurture your new found courage. You will be able to continue to stand in the face of these fears. You will be able to live a beautiful life.

You have this item outside of yourself that gives you pleasure or pride or happiness because you have it. The problem now is that, rather than keeping those good emotions in yourself (where they really are the whole time), you place them in this other object that can be lost or broken or stolen. In doing so, you allow the external environment to impact your happiness. Now, if the cup you hold happiness breaks, you are left feeling alone and without. In reality, you haven't lost anything but an attachment.  I hope this makes maybe a bit of sense! Namaste!"

You've dome the awkward step, now you have to do the hard step. You have to face everything that you feel head on, and let it pass. Friends come and go, things come and go, everything has a time limit. Your time with your friend is something that you'll allways have. Whatever caused this schism is also something you'll always have. Hiding it just makes it more volatile later, and expressing it makes it volatile now. You have to, instead, feel the emotions you don't want to feel, and then let them go. Keeping the negativity with you for even one more minute is only going to hurt you. You deserve better, and you'll make it through this.   Congratulations on making a very difficult decision, and good luck with the rest. I wish you the very best.  Namaste, friend."
howtonotgiveafuck,2naot1,junkk,2,Mon Nov 24 21:03:05 2014 UTC,"Namaste, friend. I love you too, and thank you for your response.  I would like to understand what you mean specifically by ""face everything that you feel head on"" and ""feel the emotions you don't want to feel"". Obviously I'm feeling things I don't want to feel, I'm facing anger I want to release, but the emotions are still there. Do you mean confront him about how I feel? Because I already did that once, I thought we reached an understanding, but that only made everything far worse and far more painful. Again, sparing details, but I have nothing more to say because I tried to save us by saying everything I could.  I'm doing what I can to focus on my work, my body, and my other relationships to fill the void, but when I'm alone, all that's left is what's in me. I also can't simply move away from everything that will remind me of him, not for another 6 months at least, but that will help. It didn't seem as bad until I got back, but once I'm gone for good I know I can rebuild. I just can't wait that long.  Thank you for reminding me that I made a very difficult decision though. It was the most difficult decision I've ever had to make, but not once since then have I regretted that decision. I think I just have to keep that in mind from here on out - I did everything I could to prevent this from happening, and had I not done that, I would be sitting here regretting not putting forth the effort to do so. Just that thought alone, that even despite my best efforts, it just wasn't meant to be, will help. It doesn't erase the anger, but it damn sure makes it seem more like fate just dealt me a bad hand of cards rather than it being something personal, and I can deal with that a lot better."
howtonotgiveafuck,2naot1,junkk,3,Mon Nov 24 21:26:02 2014 UTC,"Most certainly! For me, what you want to do when you're faced with negative situations and emotions is to strip away the reasoning behind it, and focus on the emotion: face it head on.   In doing this, you allow yourself to go past this person that is mad at a situation or a person or an event, and you can come to this place where you realize that you either see the problem for what it is and let it pass, or you let it consume you and break you down. Only one can be in control: you or your environment.   So what I said above was mainly just to reinforce the ideas I already see in you. I think the path you're taking is a brave one, and I think you are doing a great job by actively approaching the situation. This doesn't necessarily have to be confrontation with anyone outside of yourself, but it does mean that you should face truthfully the emotions that are inside you.   Once you decide to move on, the bindings of the events that are holding you back will loosen your grip, and you will notice that it was, in fact, you that was clutching to the negativity, not the other way around.  Hopefully that makes sense! I'm always available if you want to talk. Much love!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2naot1,22bear,1 point,Mon Nov 24 21:45:08 2014 UTC,"Ah, now I see what you mean. Focus on the emotion at my core, not the layers of social dynamics that caused it. To some extent I've started to do that, and I've talked with some other close friends about how I feel, not about the facts or step-by-step process of the situation. It's hard for me, because I deal with facts far more than emotions, and not only has that led to problems in my personal life with others who are emotional, but it has also led to problems in myself because that side of me is so underdeveloped. It's definitely gotten a lot stronger over the past two years, and because of that I'm handling this a lot better than I would have otherwise.  In the future, when I get angry, I'm not going to imagine his face. I'm going to imagine my anger. The unpersonified emotion itself, inside me, not what may have caused it to grow in the first place.   I'm going to imagine a white-hot glowing cannonball floating in front of me. That will represent my anger. I'm going to put on thermal gloves, pick it up, and drop it into a barrel of cold water. I'm going watch as the white turns to yellow, then orange, then red. Only when the glow stops blinding me will I see the beauty of the world around me.  Thank you very much!"
howtonotgiveafuck,2naot1,inherentinsignia,2,Mon Nov 24 22:06:10 2014 UTC,"Something that I have used in the past to help with in situations like this is an ""emotions wheel."" Sometimes the challenge can be naming the emotions, and I mean beyond anger. There may be some feelings underlying that anger that you don't recognize right now or know how to name. Sometimes just being able to name the emotion can help you think about why you feel the way that you do and think about what things might help you move forward.  And please know that you and your emotions are valued. Whatever you are feeling right now is the right thing to feel. It will take time for life to get back to normal, but don't let anyone put a timeline on your recovery. You will have your good days and your bad days. And sometimes you will have a set of good days in a row and then suddenly be crushed. And that is normal. It does not mean you are weak or that you aren't trying hard enough to move on. It just means that you are a normal human with normal emotions. On those days, pull out your emotion wheel, give your emotions a name, sit with them, feel them, know that your emotions are valued.  Here is a link to an emotion wheel: http://aca-arizona.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/650_Feelings-Wheel-Color.jpg  Good luck, my friend."

Thank you so much for it.  I feel isolated, depressed, ashamed, hurt, hostile, angry, hateful, bewildered, discouraged, rejected, insignificant, and helpless. I also feel dejected, whatever the feeling is when trust is completely broken, whatever the feeling is when people you once loved turn against you so suddenly and unexpectedly, and whatever the feeling is when the perception of someone you cared about was shattered by who they really were. Using the opposite side of the wheel, I feel unappreciated, disrespected, worthless, pessimistic, insecure, untrusting, and like a failure. But mostly I feel enraged, broken-hearted, and just plain broken."

I just walked away and have never allowed myself to look back. I know exactly what you're going through, because I'm in exactly the same place. I don't have advice for you, because you seem to have reached a similar conclusion as I have, but I will pass along something someone told me.   Forgiveness is setting the prisoner free and realizing that the prisoner was you all along. Anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.   You've come a long way, friend.

Make sure you phase it like your choice.  ""Can't"" is for the limitations of physics.  Some are done better with amusement - you basically laugh at the idea that you would do such a thing.  ""You must think I'm a pushover.""  Some are best as filling in a nice sandwich: say something nice, then tell them no, then say something else nice.  Side note, this is one of the best ways to deliver criticism.  Some are better using the frame of respect.  Each person, you see, has the natural right to define how they should be treated.  As a non-pushover, you have certain standards of how you should be treated by others - and you should!  If your standards are not met, expel the offender until they're willing to treat you right.  If your standards are too high, you'll find yourself alone, but virtually every person will notice an improvement to their life if they raise their standards a bit.  So it's very much a situational problem.  You'll gain experience as you say more no's... but remember, no one LIKES to be told no, but they can still RESPECT your decision, if you express yourself well."

Good excuse: ""Movies at 6? I can't; I have work from 4-9."" No need to say more than that.  Bad excuse: ""Movies at 6? Well, uh, I have to call my mom back, and I have laundry to do and I want to clean my room. Also, I told my friend I'd Skype her tonight at some point so yeah, I don't really think I can go."" This is vague as fuck. It's clear that you could easily manage your time to do this, but nobody is gonna actually do the math and confront you about it, even though they know you could probably make it if you actually wanted to."

It's your friends who find it hard to accept no as an answer.   People don't like change in their social order; you have your place in the pack and trying to change that status is going to result in growls and snarls.   Stand your ground.

Just wanted to add, however, that the idea of the brain being divided in a logical half and a creative half is largely an urban myth, unsupported by the modern understanding of the brain. I'm not sure if you were using it as a metaphor or if you believe that these concepts are literally divided up in the brain, so I'm just putting it out here."

Your body is a machine, and if you treat it as such, it becomes much more simpler to stay fit.  If you see your body as an organization of muscles where each requires some resources to emit optimally their function, it becomes logical to have the best type of food intake, and to give the right stimuli to your muscles. It's also an entity that responds exceedingly well to routine. So if you structure your day correctly, your body will shape itself naturally to it."

I secretly loved him for a long time and the news shattered me. I'm the type who usually does not give a fuck around things but this gave me stress like I've never experienced before. I cried many times, can't sleep much, can't eat much and vomited several times. (Now I understand why some people in TV shows just vomits when subjected to severe stress.) This went on for a week, me trapped in my misery and not being able to tell anyone about it. Then I was like, fuck it, I'm telling him.   So I wrote him an email about how I feel for him. He told me that I am a good friend and that he doesn't know how to reciprocate my feelings... in short he rejected me, as expected. After a day, I am cured of my vomiting, eating and sleeping disorder.  Now I am still coping. It doesn't hurt as long as I do not think about it. I hope to be in the same level of clarity you now have someday. I really like how you described the experience for you. It put into words what I cannot describe months ago. Thank you."

Relationship failing or not, telling someone you don't love them will eat you inside for a long time... the look on someones face after saying such a thing will make you wake up in cold sweats years later. I wish I wasn't ""that guy"" in her life... but I was. When I have children of my own some day, I will teach them to be very careful of what they say.

We both parted our ways, I was thinking about how the hell did it happen and she will probably never want to see me again, she is just too nerdy, smart, beautiful and innocent. She was also worried, she was happy about the kiss she thought she blew, because she never done it before (it became inside joke every anniversary now) and thought I will never want to see her again, because she didn't return the kiss due to inexperience. We are still together for over six years.  Take your chances, people, we have common goals anyway."

At worst what is going to happen is an awkward goodbye and not seeing that person again (or for some time if you were already friends before). If you are going on a date with someone and by the end of the date you go in for a kiss and she gets pissed off then you didn't want to be with that kind of person anyway.   Of course, that doesn't mean people should just randomly start going for kisses on people they have crushes on for no reason. I mean in this context it was perfectly fine and appropiate to do it.

Just dont force yourself on them.  They will have plenty of time to let you know they are not interested.  Read their body language.  If they let you get close enough to their face and dont say no or react negatively you are in the clear.    Just dont grab the back of their head suddenly and shove your tongue down their throat and you will be okay.  I PROMISE.  You will also get laid more.

howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,Slingshot20,17,Mon Nov 17 11:54:50 2014 UTC,"I generally do this when walking past co-workers for a split second just passing by and also when I'm in the break room with them for a longer period of time. When I'm passing by in the hall, I can't necessarily say I don't care but I also can't say at that moment that their answer is my priority. For me to do it is just a gesture of kindness to acknowledge their presence.   If I'm in the break room with a coworker for a longer period of time, I'll ask as a way to move into more conversation. If it's a Monday, Tuesday or hell even a Wednesday and I hadn't seen them since last week, I'll ask how their weekend was and listen. I find enjoyment in hearing what other people do with their free time and whatnot and usually that'll turn into conversation if the other person is not a complete social klutz (it takes two to tango, so if someone asks you how your weekend was, respond and ask them how theirs was back). I do my best to remember the facts they tell me so that the next time I can ask, ""Oh hey how was that trip?"" or ""How's that class you're taking going?"" and things like that and just pick right back up and show them that you are listening and not just a wall that they're talking to. They'll appreciate it and in turn you feel good that they appreciate you.  I think you're overthinking things a little too much and being a tad cynical. Think of the gesture moreso than the actual meaning. I used to be the same way, not say anything to anyone I saw in the hall or wherever. But eventually I stopped caring if anyone else cared and whatnot and more often than not, I realized people do want to converse with you."

I reply politely and end it there. ""Good thanks"" or ""not bad"" are my go-to's. You can mix it up with other stuff when you get bored or whatever.    Some people will be thrown off when you don't ask back and some may find it rude but I still haven't found a way to navigate that shit or to be ok with empty conversation, so I think I've just accepted it about myself. I'll always be a little odd."
howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,Crolleen,5,Mon Nov 17 02:53:18 2014 UTC,"Am pretty sure I'm one of the few people who do care about the response. Conversations start:   Me: Is x there?  Them: Speaking, cruyff8?  Me: Aye, how you getting on?  Them: Fine, and you?  Me: I'm grand, many thanks. Incidentally, I don't ask how you're doing for fits and giggles, I really do care, so, how are you x?"
howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,cruyff8,3,Mon Nov 17 04:19:35 2014 UTC,"I totally agree. I've always been against asking people how they are when I just don't care. I worked for a cashier for a while and I hated when people asked me how I was. I'm a cashier, you (the customer) don't give a flying fuck how I'm doing you just want to buy your pack of cigarettes. So why ask?   Or at points like in school or something where you're walking past someone and they go ""how are you doing man?"" And by the time you have a chance to respond they're already behind you and it's just weird. Why ask? Just say hey.   It's basically a thing people do to be polite but in my opinion it's pointless unless you actually want to know how they're feeling."

howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,noahdamus,2,Sat Nov 29 20:50:00 2014 UTC,"I think many people do care!!!  The KEY is context.  Most of the time when people ask that question, they want to vibe you!  Everyone has shit going on, but they want to know are you going strong, are you really down?  They don't need to know the details because the context is they have shit they need to do.  But if you crack a few beers later conversation jist might dive deeper.  The details aren't so important, a warm look in the eye, firm handshake, encouraging hugs can remedy a lot."

A lot of languages have this, French and Chinese for example.  I teach EFL and if you ask students this they give an automatic 'good how are you?' because it's not a sincere question."
howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,sevensidedsilver,2,Mon Nov 17 06:35:46 2014 UTC,"I know this isn't exactly representative of most cases but I just wanted to share a somewhat relevant story to this since you asked the question. I was actually in the same camp as you before, I thought no one cared and if answered honestly people would just offer a few words of kindness and walk away awkwardly thinking no one would be dumb enough to think they wanted a serious answer.  One time I was in a bad spot and I was in a parking lot next to my car, maybe I looked a little frazzled and some lady was walking past me and asked how I was doing. Normally I'd just pretend like I was fine but I didn't really care at the time and I just flat out said ""terrible"". She actually asked me why and part of my problem was that I was far away from home with a nearly dead phone and no cell service anyways, no wifi around, a bit lost, and then she called over some girls she was walking with and told me I could go with them to their place and charge my phone/use their internet. They even started smoking some weed and offered it to me and that was the first time I ever got high. I think one of them was possibly into some harder drugs that I may have helped them procure without knowing it at the time, pretty sure she was an addict, she was even literally crying over not having money for something. They gave me water and I didn't even watch them actually fill the glass or anything. Basically, I could have been poisoned and killed and had all my shit stolen but at the time I didn't care.   Anyhow, so maybe most of the time it seems like people don't care, but that event actually kind of changed my perception, sometimes even the unlikeliest of people can surprise you."
howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,HeyZeusCrisco,2,Mon Nov 17 18:36:15 2014 UTC,Carrying a different tone to your small talk (sounding like you actually do care) can win over more people than you'd expect.

howtonotgiveafuck,2mif7x,Gambit9000,2,Mon Nov 17 06:54:27 2014 UTC,"Guys, this is getting out-of-hand and toxic... I can't believe this is upvoted. Don't get me wrong, I am an avid supporter of not giving a fuck, but you really need to choose your battles and it isn't against people asking polite questions out of social convention.  Whether someone genuinely cares or not, someone that is hostile to you is not going to bother asking at all. If they aren't hostile to you, you seem to forget that they are a PERSON that is engaging you in friendly interaction and that shouldn't include you feeling entitled to complaining about your intimate problems that everyone is going through in one form or another.  Assuming you're speaking to strangers or associates, there is a reason that they are a stranger or associate and are not closer in your life. If you really want to speak to them about your problems, engage in mundane social greetings and learn about the person slowly and warm up to them. If you don't want to talk to them about your intimate problems, there is absolutely no harm in saying 'Ooooh well, you know how she goes' or some other random shit with a half-smile and carry on. No harm, no foul.  To be clear, I'm really not trying to downplay your issues at all and I... hell everyone understands going through bouts of depression, some worse than others. If you speak against that, you are a liar. It just sounds to me like the problem isn't 'these people' but rather the issue stems from you projecting your frustrations and depression onto other non-malicious people which is not ok. In my opinion, embrace the normalities and start slowly warming up to people of your choosing to befriend, and maybe the new found friendships would genuinely help with some of your issues. Again, if you choose not to warm-up to the individual a simple 'I am well, and yourself?' will suffice as you continue doing your own thang. You don't have to continue on with the conversation from there."

There is an opportunity for a thing called ""conversation"" where both parties interact using short statements in turn.  Nobody really cares but it's a conversation starter. It's an invitation for you to offer something interesting to discuss, or to draw the conversation to a close if you don't want to talk. The etiquette is not to launch straight in to the topic of your choosing, but to offer via a brief sentence, so they get a chance to draw things to a close in return.  How does this apply to your situation? You're depressed and someone asks ""How are you?"" - you can lie (but what's the fucking point in that) or you can offer up ""a bit shit really, but getting by. you?"" and a smile. If they are interested they'll ask more. If they aren't, they'll change the subject. No problems either way."

I suppose it's different if your'e someone who regularly suffers with severe depression and other problems (The last few months ive gone through a rather confusing breakup after 8 years and really struggling alone). It feels like you're always lying to people if you just say you're fine. But I suppose I am thinking too much into it.  If I say, I'm not too good, they ask further and I find it difficult because not many people seem to understand depression and I feel stupid for even saying I was having a bad day. Yet a lot of the time I crave someone to just talk to and lack friends (I suck socially, hence the original post).   Who wants to be that person that's always sad and having a bad day?

The purpose is more to casually exchange good vibes or simply acknowledge someone one step further than a ""hello"".  Usually, it's asked because someone is not intending to engage you any deeper but has to address or acknowledge you in some way; otherwise, it would be awkward e.g. passing by in a hallway"

Asking out in person is a show of confidence and doing otherwise makes you seem to afraid to do it (which in this case was true...but that's the next step!).

Many times we just dont even realize that we are thinking some bad self-harmful shit, or that we are procrastinating or that we have already reacted to those thoughts until we are well beyond fucked up by them.  Meditation involves staying aware of your thoughts more easily throughout the day; therefore, It can allow you to choose which thought you are willing to react on and which one dont.

howtonotgiveafuck,2mdqkf,kumquatparadise,7,Mon Nov 17 17:44:27 2014 UTC,"I think the issue you may be facing is one of early and easy success. As the director of ESA just said about philae ""The problem with success is that it looks easy."" I discovered this in high school: I used to never have to study for tests, so I never did. Then I started calculus, and I started failing, and I thought something was wrong. I thought ""When did I get dumb? What happened?""  From what I can tell, you're a pretty capable intelligent person, and you've had some success, but you haven't had to work at it. There have been problems, but they haven't been huge or devastating. Then you ran into something you couldn't do as easily, or something that you hadn't done before, and you had trouble, which is natural. But, you took the trouble to be failure, took the failure to be weakness and internalized that perceived weakness into the problems you listed: low self esteem, low motivation, etc. If I'm off base, feel free to jeer loudly at your monitor and go on with your life.   Assuming you're still reading: Here's what I've learned in my short time here.   It's easy to become a superman for around 24 hours. You can read all the all-caps hype up posts you want, start day one of /r/100pushups or whatever other excellent and admirable goal, you can really get behind the ""Just FUCKING DO IT, do what you love, fuck all the rest, society puts up all these fucking walls around you, just break right through em man"" type philosophy (not to bash it, it has its place).  But. This only works up to a point. This is the part I really struggle with, and the part I'm still figuring it out. This is the part that scares me.   Real progress, real work, real success hurts. It hurts a lot, and it hurts in the worst way. I want it to be a hurt like a leg cramp, where I can grit my teeth and power through. But it's a long, boring, tiring hurt. I takes work and it absolutely sucks sometimes. But the strength you're looking for, the strength that will take you where you want to go is not the strength of today, not to workout right now until you can't do another rep, it's the strength to do that same thing day 50 when you're bone tired and it's raining out.   The strength you want is the strength to keep on, day after day. You will doubt, but you must have faith. I had a time when I would look beneath each layer of strength to find a layer of doubt, then below that a layer of strength, then below that one of doubt, on and on like some sort of really shitty birthday cake. But, the cake is a lie. What you need is to be the skewer that goes down through all the layers, to have the mindset to keep on going and keep on looking. That's what will really get you there.   So don't read this and think ""Ok, problem solved, I'll just DO IT FUCK YEAA"". Instead, read it and recognize, in a rational and logical way, that life hurts and life sucks, and you can take it."

howtonotgiveafuck,2m9vfb,s54b32dd,3,Fri Nov 14 19:54:45 2014 UTC,"So a lot of this appears to stem from your self-image. You appear to be very critical of yourself (""I'm ugly"", ""I am often wrong"", etc.). As a result, you don't trust yourself to make decisions that are in your own best interest, and instead seek the validation of others as a source of affirmation to counteract your own self-doubt. This is something that a lot of people struggle with, and the first step to a solution is understanding that everyone struggles with these thoughts/feelings, to varying degrees.  I'm going to be perfectly honest, a lot of your thought process right now appears to be very self-destructive, and I don't know that anyone here is going to be able to help you adequately. If I were you, I would seek out some form of counseling, if possible. You sound like you need to connect with your essential self and vent your feelings and sort out your thoughts before you'll be ready to really approach the idea of not giving a fuck and/or gaining a perspective of the world that both respects yourself and doesn't place your intrinsic value on the judgment of others.  The first step in HTNGAF is to understand that your opinion of yourself, and your functional proficiency as a human being, is defined by your own set of standards, and not someone else's. You need to spend some time figuring out what makes you happy and beginning to seek that, rather than worrying about what makes other people happy, and seeking to fit their mold."

My friend is very scrupulous and tries to please everybody, but only I know how miserable he feels. It is your life. DO whatever the fuck you want, as long as it does not directly hurt other people. You are not responsible for other people emotions.  I am asexual and I did not ""come out"" because I see it as a pointless. You can express your indifference or approval of one or another choice/preference/lifestyle without making drama out of it. It is nobody else's business than yours.  You are judging and impairing yourself much more than people who don't give more than five minutes of fuck about what you wear, who you sleep with. Seriously, think about how much and for how long do you judge people."

It is nobody else's business than yours.   That's exactly what I needed to read. Stating your choices to other people only makes you paranoid about them finding that one little step out out of the way and pointing out your"" mistakes"".  Like, if you tell people ""I don't enjoy partying hard and getting drunk"", you're giving people the chance to say ""But you did that just a few days ago and you enjoyed it"". Just realize and decide what's best for you and DO it, no one needs to know."
howtonotgiveafuck,2m9vfb,k303,3,Fri Nov 14 15:37:14 2014 UTC,"I feel like unnecessary confession sound too much like explanation, an apology before it happened. When you explain/confess something you are showing your weaker side and allow critics. But when you do your thing like you do not owe explanation to anyone, you appear much more confident, it gives you more confidence and that will always attract more noise than apologising/explaining/coming out of the closet/asking permission. There is absolutely no reason for anybody to know or criticise your actions and thoughts.  I do not intend to marry, I do not drink or party, I usually am only one to talk to random strangers (North Europe), not asking anybodies permission. Life is mine to take, let the dogs bark behind me."
howtonotgiveafuck,2m9vfb,cheese_yeah,1 point,Sun Nov 16 18:13:54 2014 UTC,"You are definitely not the only one to feel this way so please don't think there is something wrong with you.   Firstly you need to learn to be proud of the personality traits you do posess and stop wishing for those that you don't. Forever trying to change yourself will leave you very unhappy. What you can change though is pretty much anything else you want.  Start small with the clothes, change a bit at a time otherwise you'll feel self conscious and people will comment- which I'm guessing you'd rather didn't happen.  Remember nobody gives a crap what you are wearing and if they look at you it is either because you look good and they like what you're wearing, or you look absolutely ridiculous. The latter is very unlikely and you know it is.  There is no rush to come out, it'll happen when you are ready and until then it is nobody's business but yours. Again, most people won't give a crap if you're gay or straight, but you might have to deal with some negativity. If you do, remember that is their issue not yours. Repeat this to yourself if you get upset and don't allow people to make you feel guilty for who you are.  In all honesty there is no quick cure for this, you will just gradually care less and build confidence. Surround yourself with positive people and cut out negativity as much as you can. Learn to speak up if you know you are right, and say no to something every day if you can. Remember you don't owe anyone anything.  You are probably never going to be the loudest, most confident person in the crowd but that is fine, that is who you are and what people admire and respect about you."

Its ok to admit your desire to make connections with others. Its almost universal as far as human desires go. But you have to realize that this frustration with yourself over not making connections is not useful to you. It only hinders any progress you will make. The disillusion is you creating this idea of what success will be like and then becoming upset when that doesn't come into fruition.  You want connection, but you may or may not be able to get it.

So maybe, rather than trying to be aloof and shit and trying to seem cool to other people by talking yourself up or just not talking because you have a misguided sense of what HTNGAF means, maybe the next time you go out you just try asking a few questions befor you launch into aloof/self-involved mode, and you assess other people as you would any other decision making process; first step, define what you value in a friendship. Next step, get to know the person across from you (ask them questions, listen to their responses). Then, figure out some common ground, and work from there.  Connections don't typically happen overnight; if you want people to give a fuck about you and your thoughts, you have to give a fuck about them and their thoughts (to a point). The first step, though, is always assessment. This is what is meant by first impressions. It's not a strictly judgmental thing! it's also about understanding your interests and determining whether you have enough interest in this other person to invest time and energy into connecting with them.  tl;dr HTNGAF is not about being all things to all people, or being aloof or distant or ""cool"". It's about being true to your beliefs but open to new ideas, and constantly seeking perspective."

Not happy with work? Figure out if you can change jobs, and try to work toward a job that makes you happy.  Not happy with your health? Figure out what you can do to be in a better state of health, and work toward that state.  Not happy with your education?

You should try turning your phone off completely for a few days if you don't have any extremely important people you need to contact. There is something nice about nobody knowing where you are or what you're doing. Phones suck the life out of the world a little.

howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,AspiringHoneyBadger,24,Tue Nov 11 16:36:44 2014 UTC,"You have a very long life ahead of you... Everyone fucks up or has bad things happen to them somewhere in their teens/20s.... everyone. They date the wrong people, get into substances, have unplanned kids, have abusive families, flunk out of school, get arrested for stealing cars, whatever....  It's all a learning process and at the end of each ""issue/mistake/oops"" all you need to say is ""well, probably should think that one through better next time... that didn't turn out so great... oh well... onward!""  If you still have ""feelings"" for someone who has moved on... the feelings you should have are ""Well, I wish her the best, most wonderful life."" Thinking she ""got away"" and that somehow you should have been able to ""control"" another person... is foolhardy and selfish. Even if you had spoken up, the chances of it being more than a short ""relationship"" were already slim.   To think that somehow... if you can done something different... that you would now be living inside of some great romance novel.... is, well, pretty idiotic.   Sorry for the truth man, but life does not work that way... stop thinking that a) it does and b) it does for ""everyone but pooooor wittle meeeeeeee"". Because, well, that's completely untrue crap.  What you see of other people's lives is the fiction they present on FB... and it's... fucking fiction.   Real life... it's fucking awkward, clumsy and messy... there's no such thing as this dream world where everyone else is living a perfect life and you're the only one who isn't.   No one is living the life you think they are living.   Compare yourself to..... no one. Your only goal is to find your own unique way through life.  And that unique way through life has to be .... on your own.   You cannot depend on any other human being anywhere to make you happy or fulfilled or anything like that. That all has to come from you.   You can find ""people to share your life with as equals"" but do not under any circumstances hang your happiness on any person or thing or event outside of yourself.   Stop trying to ""program your life or other people in your life"" and then wondering why it doesn't work... In your head you have built up this fictional relationship to be some ""ideal.. she's perfect... we'll get married and 10 years from now...""   Fuck NO. That's bullshit. It's fantasy.   Stop living in a fantasy world. Stop trying to model or evaluate your life against the fantasy lives others present. None of that is real.  No one will want to be with you as an equal, honest partner until you can be that for yourself first.   Stop assuming that you can ""con"" someone into being with you because you fantasize that they will somehow ""heal you and make you whole."" Only you can do that.   She moved on not because of anything you did or didn't do... she moved on because she realized you were not anywhere near ready to be a great partner. Which is the absolute truth. Work on yourself for the next few years and figure out your life first. Then look for someone to potentially share it with."

howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,rand0mip,33,Tue Nov 11 21:59:11 2014 UTC,"I'll take a crack at this, hopefully it helps. But this is my first time trying this.  I'm 23, finally a true senior in college(6 years later), not because I'm stupid, or I messed up. But because the past 2 years I have spent fighting cancer, twice. I know what you're feeling. Missing out on the fun of college, parties, girls, friends, the whole 9 yards. In the past 2 years, I've lost friends, potential girlfriends, the ability to open my mouth, speak normally, I've got scars on my body and face, felt sicker and weaker than I'll ever feel in my life.  But, I am alive. I'm about to finish my degree, finding some new friends, new hobbies, a new normal for me. Do I hate everything that's happened and regret things I've said and done and lost? Of course. If I could turn back time and stop this whole crap from happening, I would. In a heartbeat.  It wasn't all bad though.. I now have a motorcycle which I love, I've met people who I'd never have met without having had cancer, I have a new appreciation for things which I took for granted.  So, what's this got to do with you? Well, one thing that helped me was instead of focusing on all the shitty parts. Try and think about the good. You can't change the past. I can't go back 2 years to my college prime. You can't go back 4 years and get the girl who got away. Instead of hating yourself for making a mistake which everybody does. Try and change the way you're looking at the situation, yourself, and her. Remember the good things, sure she got away, more probably will too, but you'll find someone eventually.  Don't let your fears hold you back. If there's one thing I've taken away from this journey, it's to do what you want and what makes you happy. If you want to sit in front of the tv all day, don't think about how crappy you feel because you aren't doing anything productive. LOVE that you're just hanging out and taking a day off, you probably deserve it.   You can either focus on the negatives, or try and find a positive somewhere, trust me, they're there. Even in my case with cancer, out of all the fucked up shit thats happened, some good came out of it.  Hope this helps..."

I think you should just abandon that phrase, and never say it again. You're stuck thinking if you could have had it and everything would have been better. The fact is no one can know that, not even you.   Other than emotions it looks like you basically have your shit together financially and you're still young. That being said, the only obstacle left is yourself. I'm a bit in the same boat as far as thinking life is shit, with no confidence and little courage. I'm slowly getting better, with some self help books and forcing myself out of my comfort zone by agreeing to go do things with colleagues. I have no idea what to do there but accept that I'm the problem and promise myself to work on it. I also think not obsessing over it helps. I find that i made a few friends this year entirely by accident, so im sure the same will happen to you."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,WalrusSoup,6,Wed Nov 12 15:10:39 2014 UTC,"Agreed, toss that phrase like it's hot. I thought I'd met the one that got away ... then I met the next one."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,nospacebar14,6,Tue Nov 11 19:02:21 2014 UTC,"Man I'm with you on a good bit of how you feel. I grew up awkward, not liked by many, didn't have many interests or passions growing up. I hardly played sports and what I did, track, I wasn't even that good. I couldn't hold much of a good conversation and man people looked down on me. I never got any second chances.  Then college hit and I decided to stay in town and not leave, partly because I got 90% off of tuition because my dad taught at the university and I had some scholarships. I now had a new beginning, one that I was never given growing up, except I had to figure it all out. This meant how to be interesting, good in social situations and making new friends, attracting girls, etc. You name it. Except the problem is that I didn't quite ever figure it out during college. I didn't figure it out quickly enough to truly excel and have confidence to be well liked, go after things that really interested me, and live a life that many people would want to be apart of. I had some good friends but often they were never the friends I wanted. To top it off, I grew up in a very conservative religious background and didn't really drink/party until maybe a little of my senior year when I slowly came away from those hardcore beliefs. On top of this, I never traveled all that much, did super cool college things while I had the time such as studying abroad or moving away to do a cool internship, or having those really fun spring breaks (go back to lack of good friends).  After college I started meeting new people that thought differently and had different experiences. After looking back at my life, I really got depressed. I had a quarter life crises. Here I am in the same city I've never left already working an office job, although a successful career job. But I wasn't happy. I wasn't truly living. I had been this caged person because I hadn't been given the environment I needed to thrive and I hadn't been able to learn what I needed to in time. I wanted to go back and play sports because I finally figured out that I enjoy playing them. I want to go back and learn how to play guitar and start a band. I want to go back and pick a different college that provides better opportunities and to get away from this city. I want to break rules and feel like I'm truly living while I can. And I couldn't do any of this. I even took this out on my parents and quit talking to them at times because I knew deep down they were part of the problem because of their mundane life choices.  Believe me man, I have many of those ""I wonder what would've happened"" girls. I'm decently attractive and girls were interested in me. I just didn't have the confidence and experience to get them.  So to come back to you, I'm 25 and things have become almost a 180. I've learned to put my passions first in life and that there is always another girl. A week ago I just got turned down again by a girl, a girl I was willing to wait until she was ready to date and work through some things first because she was that awesome. But you know what? After the hurt I began to see the awesomeness of her turning me down. I'm happy because this recharged my mind to see all the potential in life. I still can and need to shoot for what dreams I feel are reachable. Sure, some things have passed me by such as excelling in sports, being super outgoing in college, starting a band, etc. But I realized I was about willing to throw out some of the rest of my dreams for a girl, instead of finding someone who's dreams aligned with mine. I've wanted to move away and am currently contemplating a huge move, to go live in another country. Since this girl dumped me all I can think about is the joy I'll have once I'm in the city that I want to live in. All the opportunities that I have that I won't have if I stay here.  You know what's made me the most happy after college? Going after those things that I want. And man have these past few years been great. I wanted to learn how to hip hop dance. I found some friends who wanted the same thing and we took 3 months of hip hop dance classes together. I've been taking guitar lessons for over two years now. I'm still not great but man it feels goods to play in front of people. I learned to ski and snowboard. I met some friends that have access to and have let me drive their Ferrari's and Lamborghini's which still gives me a ""did that seriously happen"" reaction. For 10 years I wanted a motorcycle. So I took a motorcycle class and bought a sport bike the day I finished. Riding that bike gives me some of the most joy I've ever had. It's the little things that keep me going and jumping through the hoops of life. Achieving the things I've wanted. Feeling like you are living. Being able to play guitar around some friends hanging out. Tearing up the dance floor even if you look stupid because you've been able to raise your confidence over those around you. People don't really care if you are clearly having a good time. I recently changed jobs and work from home which gives me even more flexibility over how to spend my time. Over the past two years I've managed to travel around the country and a little outside. I realized today that I need to keep pursuing my dream to see Europe. I'll find a way. No one is getting in my way.  Man, I still get depressed about things. I have to look back and see how far I've come and see what I have. How far my confidence has come. I'm not saying I'm the most alpha, but man I stand out in terms of not giving an F about the things I do. People notice. Girls notice. Now I can tell I attract people into my lives, guys and girls. I don't get caught up on the lost girls because I know there are other great girls out there. It's just a matter of time before another one comes around and then I'll be ready to go after her.  Keep your head high man. Be grateful for where you are at. See what potential in life that you have. Go for the things you want. People will follow."

I'm currently in my fourth year of university, and the whole time I've worked hard, and socialized minimally. In fact, I've still yet to go to a college party and I don't plan on it. And it's not as though I'm horribly disfigured, socially awkward or have no friends. In fact, I've always gotten a lot of attention for my looks and am pretty personable. I used to worry that I was blowing ""the best years of my life"" and my one chance to get the college experience. But at this point I realize that I'm not missing out. Living my life like a typical college kid just isn't my thing and that's OK. In fact, the typical college kid's idea of a good time looks pretty gross and pathetic to me. And really, what do we go to college for? To party or to get a degree so that hopefully we can have a career that we love? And many college graduates aren't  able to get a good job straight away, so you're doing better than most.       And I also think that it's a myth that the college years are the best years of your life. Personally, my life keeps getting better and I think it will continue to at least well into my 30's. And I think it would be kind of sad to peak so early. You're still incredibly young and you have plenty of time to appreciate your youth and have fun.         And since I presume there is no way that you can reconnect with the one that got away (or is there?), all you can do is try to move on. Now I don't know exactly how to do this but I'd suggest trying online dating. It's a good way to go on a lot of dates and maybe you'll meet someone cool or if nothing else it could be a good distraction and a good way to get yourself back out there. While I'd formerly denounced online dating, a trusted friend highly recommended OKCupid and while I wasn't looking for anything serious, I ended up meeting my now long term boyfriend on there, who himself was initially just using the site as a distraction/ way to get out of the house after his best friend died. I know finding the love of your life on a site like that as we did is rare but it's possible. Best of luck to you :)"
howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,Delilahhaze,2,Tue Nov 11 19:00:16 2014 UTC,"If this is not a repeating situation, idealizing the past will not only get you nowhere, it will make you go in reverse. After all, it is the past that you are chasing, and time only moves forward. Letting go is not just about not forgetting it ever happened-- instead, I interpret it to be a distillation process where time has boiled away the haze of the present and has left some of the larger ideas about it. However, as with any distillation process, there will still be shit on the pan. However, because time has passed and you are no longer in the situation, it is easier to scrape away the dregs that seem to force their way into your line of sight and ruin a true image of what it is, and find what is truly useful.   In this story is a lesson that you know personally that you can learn, and you know yourself better than anybody else. Seek to improve through it, and not fixate on the fantasy of what could have been-- the time has already passed, and we can save that for a different quantum world.   I've been a little wordy here, but let me end my post with something to think about:  The brain metabolizes about 20% of your body's caloric intake. If you're a normal person, you're allocating a portion of those 400 calories to an aspect of something that is not only useless to mull over, but ultimately resigning you to the fate of a worse overall mindset, putting you in a worse mood overall. It gets easier to not think about it once you start to stop. Even if you may not be able to come to a full halt, pumping your brakes here and there definitely help take off some momentum."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lz7vn,NooooCHALLS,2,Tue Nov 11 19:19:42 2014 UTC,"She's not ""the one that got away"", she's just one. Maybe she's a pretty good one, maybe she was into you, but you need some perspective bro.  You weren't ready for the life that she wanted for you, and maybe you both wanted that life, but something was in your way, whether it's yourself or someone else is irrelevant. What happened happened; you can't change it. You can, however, adjust your attitude toward what happened, and what happens moving forward.  You know that fear that you lost her? That's what's holding you back right now. The goal is to become self-aware; understand where those feelings come from. They're from a dark part of your past, a manifestation of your depression, an embodiment of the anxiety, doubt, and guilt you were dragged down with for the time that you struggled with those feelings. Your personal well-being and happiness is dependent on your ability to understand, reason through, and to address those feelings in a productive, meaningful way.  You say you're happy with yourself, but there's this regret you feel. HTNGAF is all about letting shit go that you can't control, managing the things you can control, and knowing the difference between the two. You can't change what happened. You can change how you manage those memories, and your emotions surrounding them. Instead of focusing on the girl, focus on the path you've tread away from that time of unhappiness; focus on the depth of perspective you've gained living through that; focus on the life you've created for yourself, and realize that those challenges helped shape your current self.  It's not about ""getting past"" what you did; you're already past that point in your life. It's done, it's lived, it's a chapter in a book that's marched on. It's about accepting that it's a few pages in a larger book, and focusing on the chapters yet to be written will yield more results than agonizing over the paragraphs you've already completed.  You're self-aware; you know it's unhealthy to be thinking about this stuff in the frame of mind you've been using; it's time to start giving yourself credit for that self-awareness, and realize that it makes you a stronger, more well-rounded person."

I can definitely relate to the feeling of being unwilling to work hard for something because you think it's hopeless. I've never really found the motivation to work hard to change myself for this reason, but lately I've been coming to the realization that difficult doesn't mean impossible. Hopefully it finally sticks!  Thanks for the post!"

howtonotgiveafuck,2lx76d,huskarl,2,Tue Nov 11 10:02:37 2014 UTC,"Good advice! You're right, I'm a very introspective person and while that has helped me in some respects I tend to get stuck in my head. I've never been very good at living in the moment but I've heard that focusing on the physical world is a good way of learning to be someone who lives in the present."

The idea of leaving my comfort zone is still extremely scary to me, even though I now realize it's what's really making me miserable. The difference for me now is that before I felt like it was impossible to ever break out of this mindset and take control of my life. Now I know it's absolutely possible, but it's going to require a lot of time and effort which I am much more determined to take on now that I realize my comfort zone has done me no favours."

howtonotgiveafuck,2lvepa,ghost-of-harrenhal,22,Mon Nov 10 16:49:13 2014 UTC,"For anybody having this problem, here's an explanation that might help you:  I probably don't have the level of anxiety that you had about this issue, but I am the type to prefer hanging out with 1 or 2 of my friends over like 10 of them all at once. The main thing about big groups is that even within big groups, the ""large group"" is actually comprised of a few smaller groups. Once you think of it that way, it's like you're visiting like 4 different regular groups of friends, just in one setting.   Let's be honest, within each of these large groups of 20 are smaller cliques of anywhere from 4-6 groups of 3-6. I actually prefer to think of it this way because I am somewhat of an analytical person, and like to figure out the underlying structures of things, including social settings. I don't necessarily have a problem with large groups, but this is what I have noticed from my experience.  Hope this helps!"

howtonotgiveafuck,2lvepa,NooooCHALLS,3,Mon Nov 10 18:36:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah I have a tendency to bounce between groups within an event like that. Nobody is really a person that can address an entire group of 20 at a time-- it is generally just not able within our mental capacity or ego to have our attention split that way. Who's going to want to talk 1/20th of the time? Your group of friends aren't an AA meeting or anything like that. All it is is that you're hanging out with the friends you want, and have the option to talk to other people.  But you should totally go & talk with the other people too. Exploring options to see what other people are like is always a good thing if you already know all about the ones closer to you. Unless you haven't seen them in a while."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lvepa,butnig,1 point,Mon Nov 10 18:46:14 2014 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense... I've sort of seen this gradually form through my childhood to now... As kids you had the usual bunch of people every day, having fun. Yet, as you grow older, and I noticed it a lot through my time at College at about 16-18, you meet loads more people and suddenly your group of 6 close friends grows and suddenly these 20+ gatherings of everyone knowing each other and on friendly terms sort of thing occurs and its all good and I don't really have an issue with it...   But what really stresses me out is how everybody has a different relationship within the group and one person may not like another or a few people are doing something together which a lot of us aren't and this social network between everyone grows and I just find it personally tiring trying to catch up."

If you are in a bad place in life, don't do vipassana - it can bring out some things you should rather not deal with while your mind is already troubled.

Which will have the opposite intended effect. My advice is to fully immerse yourself in the practice. Leave the skeptic at home for 10 days then make judgements as you please. But give it your all while your butt is on the cushion.   As for challenges, observing Noble Silence was difficult for me. You can't speak, make gestures or eye contact while engaged in practice.

Calm and rational, like being deep in the ocean with a storm going on above you. Don't try super hard to do anything, be as effortless as possible.

It's probably pretty stupid on their part, but this wasn't some malicious act to purposely fuck up your day. It doesn't matter if you were in the right, or if they were in the wrong, because this really isn't a big deal. It all turned out okay - you parked somewhere else, didn't you? You got what you needed, and went home, and everything was normal even though you had to drive around for another five minutes?   And, honestly, everything is better when you don't assume the worst in people. Maybe they had a reason behind it - maybe someone in the other car is disabled and they needed that spot so they wouldn't have to walk as far, or maybe they were just really excited and wanted to do something nice for their friend, or maybe they were late for something incredibly important. You even acknowledged that they were clearly in a hurry, and that you were not, so give them the benefit of the doubt. In any case, don't worry about it!

Why waste anymore of my own energy on something that has already happened? I'm not saying it is easy but over time it has become a habit.   I can give an example: I went out to dinner with my partner the other night and we ordered a drink each. However, I messed up and left my ID at home. It is the first time I have actually been IDed so I just had stopped thinking about it. The bartender was great about it and gave me a refund and a free drink- so I am thinking I am lucky here! I messed up and they were so nice! I hate any kind of conflict, so in my mind I just think to take it as a compliment that they thought I was under 18 and left it. Almost an hour later my partner brings it up upset about it. I had forgotten about it so I simply say that I left that at the counter when I walked away and asked why he was still carrying it around. He was taken a back but thought about it and calmed down.   So... Why are you still carrying this around with you? Next time, leave it at the car park spot when you drive away.  If that doesn't work, try to imagine their story. Someone yells at me? I imagine that they just found out their mum is in hospital or something like that. It makes the person human again in my mind and their actions more relatable."

I'm pretty good at holding and continuing conversations so I've never had a problem with guiding conversations and I've never given a single fuck about what other people think or if I do something embarrassing. I'm great at public things like speeches and just talking to people when I need to and I don't feel even slightly awkward or shy in those situations.  My problem is I can NEVER start a conversation, I can never start anything really, I have a hard time starting literally anything and I really don't know why. When I say anything I mean anything, I have a hard time going up to strangers for directions or even a guide who's job is it to give me directions. I just can't and I don't know what to do about it.  Every girlfriend, or friend for that matter, I've ever had was met through them coming up to me, I've literally never met a person through me initiating the conversation.

howtonotgiveafuck,2ljin7,kilkil,7,Fri Nov 7 05:42:19 2014 UTC,"Do you never introduce yourself? It's actually a really simple way to start talking to someone at a social gathering or in a class or something. I've found the most polite way is just to offer your hand, smile, and say ""I'm (name)"". Then you can follow it up with asking questions about the person. Generally just think about how little you know about them, and try to fix that. Everyone has a different story and different perspective. Find something about them that's interesting to you and go from there.  Sometimes people react strangely when you do this, but it's usually because they're shy and don't know what to do themselves.  As for approaching workers, just start by saying "" Excuse me"" and then asking your question. If this is hard for you, then you probably just need more practice."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ljin7,FranklinDelanoB,6,Wed Nov 19 05:12:41 2014 UTC,"Sounds like you're suffering from approach anxiety. Only one way I know to fix it. You have to treat it like a phobia and teach yourself that approaching will not result in an outcome you can't handle. Start small. Go to a public place like a mall or something and ask 5 people what time it is. Very very simple. But then each time you go out you have to up the ante and make a more difficult goal for yourself. It helps to not wait too long to get the ball rolling. Do your first one immediately and you get a sort of energetic buzz because you just broke whatever internal social code that's holding you back and some how survived. You're just gradually proving that early maladjusted world view incorrect.   I first discovered this as a kid when I was 13 and my friend was 15 and we went to a  theme park. He would just walk around bumming cigarettes from random people. I could not believe that he could just break social code, bother strangers, ask for shit from them, be underage, and somehow nothing bad happened. Sometimes they asked him how old he was. He would proudly say 15. Sometimes people wouldn't give it to him but he didn't fucking care. There was a practically infinite amount of people for him to bother. All of whom would forget him nearly as soon as he left. I tried this for myself and unfortunately became a smoker for a few years, but I would him a cigarette and then stay, then ask for a light too (sometimes people get irritated when you ask for 2 things) the. I'd stay and have a conversation. I met so many random people this way. I don't smoke anymore but talking to strangers produces some of the most honest and surprising conversations."
howtonotgiveafuck,2ljin7,FranklinDelanoB,7,Wed Nov 19 05:21:47 2014 UTC,"I'm horrible at approaching women. The only time I feel comfortable doing it is if I'm at a social gathering where there is a host who has invited a ton of people. I know it sounds boring, but ""So how do you know [host name]?"" is such an easy way to strike up a conversation. I don't care if it's not particularly smooth or eloquent, it works. It's such a simple question and it's extremely easy to continue. The answer will generally be something like:   I live next to the host (let's call him Tom) Tom's a colleague of mine I went to high school with Tom Tom and I play squash together I actually don't know Tom, I'm from out of town and a friend brought me here   Inevitably the person you're talking to is going to give you some detail about her life you can ask a question about. If she doesn't, whatever, tell her you like her funky bracelet. She'll tell you where she got it from and you can go from there."

I always used to be the same but now I'd happily walk up to someone and just say ""excuse me, can you tell me where X is please?"" They tell you and you're on your way. You won't see that person again so don't worry about it. Plus they've forgotten you after 20 seconds anyway so there's nothing to worry about. Try it out sometime just walk up to someone and ask them where something is. Afterwards you will be wondering why you were so worried in the first place! Good luck."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ljin7,Kitad,2,Fri Nov 7 09:25:15 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure my way is for everyone, but one of the things I do is basically say whatever comes to mind. If you mull over a topic for too long, you'll become lost on what to say. If something somewhat logical and reasonable pops into your head, just say it. Bring something to attention. It comes off as random sometimes but if someone says that just be like, ""Yeah, I get that sometimes. Sometimes I just can't shut off the ol' brain.""   If you're about to say something that could be potentially damaging, back out and redirect. Search the room for something to say. Otherwise, talk about current events, the weather, or even compliment the person, that becomes a great way to start talking. Grasp onto whatever will move conversation forward and then go that direction. I'll admit it's not easy - I struggle with this if I'm not in the right mood to socialize - but since you're already well-trained in actual conversation, I think after you practice getting the ball rolling in real life situations, you'll become a pro in no time. :)"

Calling out/narrating your own social awkwardness or nuances and laughing about it is an incredible tool in changing your mindset.
howtonotgiveafuck,2ljin7,thejaytheory,12,Sun Nov 9 16:41:50 2014 UTC,"This a million. What people don't realize is that EVERYONE is fucking awkward at first.  Sometimes the vast self-centeredness of humans amazes me. Even friends whom I consider to be pretty social ocasionally complain about being awkward at new social situations. But at the same time they  fail to realize that everyone begins by feeling awkward as well.  There is nothing wrong with this, or anything right for this matter. We humans are programmed this way. Your brain releases chemical reactions that make you uncomfortable in social situations you have no control over for the sole reason that being new in a group a couple of thousands of years ago meant that you had a lower survival rate if the tribe didn't accept you.  Eventually, people lose the awkwardness by simply getting comfortable with the group or person they are with, or with the classic help of our friend, alcohol.  The problem is that people (who are attached to their ego) take themselves so seriously that they make an identity out of it ""oh i'm such an awkward person, there must be something wrong with me"". And you know what they say, whatever you resist, persists. So eventually they subconsciously attach themselves to that persona.  Of course, there are exceptions, there are people who are more social and can get comfortable no matter what (there are also others who are pretty good at pretending), maybe they had a good childhood or they learned to accept and interpret social anxiety in a helpful way. But the point is, these are the exceptions and not the norm.  (I have the theory that ""shy people"" or self-proclaimed ""introverts"" or ""socially awkward penguins"" feel the exact same reactions as the rest of people, they just frame them in a very unhelpful way and tend to socially isolate themselves because they can't take the momentary discomfort which ends up being a vicious circle)  So please, stop making an identity out of that, stop thinking you are the center of the universe and that the opinion others have over you matters, stop hiding behind the internet or not doing things because you may feel a little bit of emotional discomfort. Embrace the awkwardness, learn to like the process of getting to know people, put yourself out of your comfort zone, hold eye contact to strangers on the street, if you want to take it to the extreme, practice having conversations with random people. On the other hand, you may also want to exagerate the awkwardness, see how awkward you can take a conversation and how other people may react, laugh at it. Don't take shit so seriously.  Above all, learn to be present in the moment and accept the things that you don't like. Be comfortable at being uncomfortable.  TL; DR Everyone is fucking awkward, you are not the center of the universe, there is nothing ""wrong"" with you, it's just a natural reaction, talk to random people on the street"

I remember when I worked as a cashier in a discount store a couple of years ago, seeing a customer would immediately evoke the ""oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck! Please don't come to me!"" alarm in my head.   I've only been working at the coffee shop for a few months now but pretty much none of that social anxiety remains. It was balls out terrifying the first few weeks; jobs like this are a lot harder than many give credit. It's A LOT of new information to take in, in a very short period of time; not to mention the near constant stimulus happening around you, but that's why it's so effective. Your just inundated in it and you don't have a choice other than to keep you head above water.  Looking back it's hard to believe that my social anxiety was ever that bad considering how I feel at work now. I like my co-workers, the regulars know me and we chat about our lives; few things I love more than making a customer laugh. The only real source of anxiety has been around making drinks on the bar. I know what I'm doing, but once there's more than 4 drinks in queue I tend to get flustered, which has been a cause of friction between us, but today she came up and told me that she's noticed I've really been improving on bar and to keep up the good work. That really made my day."

""What do you like to do?""  and last but not least:  ""What did you dream about last night?""  To clarify a bit about my last comments, the only real static thing in my life (besides what I do on a day to day basis) has been this fleeting vision that I've been chasing forever. It's a set of properties, unknown, but immediately apparent, that are ascribed to two people.  I don't know if I'm none, one, or both of the people. And I actually feel as if there are two people inside me. Now, I'm not sure if that's just my ideal, who I want to be, or who I want to be with. I don't know.  So I 'develop' both sides. Giving roughly equal time to both. I'm not sure which is me. It's awfully confusing.  Ideally, I'd like to find whoever it is I'm looking for. And whenever I feel like I'm ready to give up, something comes along to remind me that what i'm looking for does indeed exist.  Good Charlotte has always been my go-to whenever I feel ""lost"" or need a reminder of whatever. Lots of good life lessons I've taken from them."

It may not be a big deal the first or second time, but it will happen time and time again. At some point you're going to need to deal with that instead of pretending it doesnt bother you. In fact, trying to convince yourself that bad things in life don't matter is just as unhealthy as thinking that only the bad things in life matter.  the reason why buddhist monks can practice their philosophy is because they isolate themselves from the world for the most part. a buddhist monk cannot be completely unattachted to everything and still hope to live a somewhat sustainable lifestyle in modern society. Now, if your goal is to become a buddhist monk, then by all means. But if you think you can go through life just passively not caring about the little people then you're going to have a real bad time."

howtonotgiveafuck,2lhem0,MonkahBoy,2,Fri Nov 7 02:32:36 2014 UTC,"When i said ""stomped on"" i meant basically to be taken advantage or sabotaged in some way. You can try to do good and be cool and all that but there are people who will see that as a sign of weakness. You will never stop people like that from existing just by virtue of being ""good"". So then, how do you reconcile your desire to live a ""good"" lifestyle with the reality that people out there could give two shits about the world or you and will not hesitate to take advantage of your nature for their own gain? Why would it make someone less happy? Well, no one is an angel. Eventually someone would get brought down by this happening all the time. Denying that you would is just self-delusion.   Once you decide to get back up, does it really make sense to change nothing? Why did you get back up in the first place?   No, it doesn't make sense to change nothing. If we're talking about me personally, I would never put myself in such a situation, but if I did i would make sure it wouldn't happen again. So basically i would change. Why did i get back up in the first place? Because it doesn't make sense to stay down. Eventually one gets back up and moves on. But hopefully after having become wiser after the event"

You're right about never being to stop people with bad virtue by being ""good"". That doesn't mean you shouldn't be good to other people.  And let's say that I do get taken advantage of. I am almost 100% sure I will feel unhappy for a bit, but it goes away so quickly because I don't want to dwell on this event. I'm going to learn and move on from it. I definitely don't plan to fall for this one again.  Being taken advantage of or scammed or whatever is the same as failing. You fall, get back up, and you're wiser than you were.

I can only do that on occasion but I find I can do it more and more as I get older. When you cut away all the fog, you're left with something more real, the first step is recognizing fog, that's where this guy seems up to, he's telling everyone about the fog about ""the matrix"" just the fluff of everyday life that shields us from each other.  He's an advocate for the cause but unless it's intentional his writing shows he still has a lot of layers of distortion he needs to remove before becoming truly free.  I think that's where the ""plugged back in"" comes from, he plugged out a little bit and felt it but decided it wasn't for him, he's trying to get people to plug out at least that far.

Turned out to be helpful because she had slept through the alarm she set and the random person woke her up in time for class.  edit: someone was pissy about word choice"

There's a difference between napping every chance you get on random couches throughout the day, and deciding to nap at work at random times throughout the day. Same goes with their point about drinking. Or walking around in pajamas. Good luck keeping a job when you decide to start showing up in PJs.

All my friends live in dorms or apartments close by and can easily take naps whenever they want. For me it's a 10 minute walk and about a 30 minute drive. I found that a lot of the libraries have study rooms you can rent to do group work, but during the day they're mostly unused and you can safely nap inside. Also, most buildings will have study areas in hidden places and different floors that people taking 200+ person lecture hall type classes won't ever run into. At times these may just be a few comfy chairs or one table, but it gets the job done. If you join a research group or get a job on campus you might have access to work areas/offices where you could nap or at least keep your backpack safe. Graduate student break rooms tend to be comfortable nice places, if you sleep there enough they'll assume you're one of them. Man what I'd give to have a few Japanese Pod style hotel rooms on campus."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ldj9g,madlarks33,26,Wed Nov 5 15:56:26 2014 UTC,"This is really good advice, but I would suggest an exercise make this idea more concrete.  Allow yourself to give 10 fucks at any given point in time. Think about things that are important to you, that actually impact your mental and physical well-being, and assign the 10 fucks to these things as you see fit. Don't do this in your head, write it down in a journal or put it into a spreadsheet.  Now, every time you find yourself getting worked up, you will look at your journal or spreadsheet. If the source of your distress is not on your list, one of two things is happening:    You need to chill the fuck out because it isn't really that important to you. You didn't properly allocate your fucks in the first place.   React accordingly. At first you might find yourself moving your fucks around a lot, but after a while you should have an accurate representation of what things are important to you.  Obviously you can tweak this exercise to fit your own needs, but the basic principle is that you will be able to hold yourself more accountable by committing your fucks in writing."

howtonotgiveafuck,2ldj9g,LiTHiUM_Powered,5,Wed Nov 5 21:23:04 2014 UTC,"I find it hard to sit down and think about what I should be giving fucks to.   I recently read something that helped me define what was really important to me: what my values were, the type of person I want to become.   'Close your eyes and imagine you are at a funeral for a close friend or loved one. You walk up to the door and upon entering see many familiar faces. Immediate and extended family, old and new friends, coworkers, etc. You walk up to the casket and look inside. You see yourself lying there- this is your funeral.'  'You turn around and take a seat, as they are about to begin. There are to be 4 or so different speakers who will share with the congregation the impact you had on their lives. '  'What would you want them to say about you? What legacy would you want to leave behind? How would you want to be remembered?'  The point of this exercise is to realize the person you want to become. What values, behaviors and beliefs do you want to define your life? What is your purpose for being on this earth?  Sometimes you must begin with the end in mind to realize what fucks should be given and what fucks are meaningless.   This helped me. I hope it helps anyone who needed inspiration to sort the good and the bad fucks."

I took my usual route, straight up the biggest hill on campus. See, I like to finish my work and then put on some rage against the machine and make that hill my bitch. Most people walk up but nah, I say fuck it and power on up. It's the most rewarding way to end the night. Anyway, I was halfway up the hill last night when my bike chain snapped. Not fell off, not came unlinked, snapped. I wanted to scream. I wanted to break shit. Shit other than my bike, that is. But then I thought about my situation again. Who cares if my chain is broken? I can buy a new fucking chain. Yelling and screaming and complaining isn't gonna get me up this hill and home, it's not gonna buy me a new chain.  Picking up my bike and walking it is what's gonna get me home. So I put on some more upbeat tunes and I scooter-pushed my bike all the way home with the biggest goddamn grin on my face.

howtonotgiveafuck,2lfinn,Lightfiend,2,Thu Nov 6 01:51:40 2014 UTC,"Going after a master's in social work helped me realize a lot of shit about my family. We had to do a mental-health family tree. Once it was all on paper I could see the dysfunction as clearly as a marble rolls down a slope. And that is how it happened too.  My great-grandfather was diagnosed with a terminal illness and killed himself. My grandfather's life changed from being the spoiled heir-apparent to being an outcast of a small town.  He was always resentful of how the town (world) treated him from age 12 on and thereafter was untrusting and suspicious of whatever he perceived as disloyalty. The villagers truly did some messed up shit from the suicide/damned to hell stigma.  WWII messed him up much more. My mom was born 9 months after the wedding and it seems like he resented having to share his wife (whom he was finally home with after years apart) with a baby. My mom and grandma lived with my grandma's mom the next 5 years while grandpa went to school and looked for a job.  My mom was the only grandchild on that side, and her grandma was very loving, warm and close as my mother's primary caretaker. Then my grandpa got a job across country and she was torn from the only life she'd known and the person she knew best. She was soon shunted aside as a new baby arrived, grandpa started a career and my grandma was doing what new moms have to do.  It seems the rest of my mom's life she has mourned her grandma and early childhood. Her dad was an ass, her mom was preoccupied and (from what I've gathered) my mom withdrew into memory of the past and fantasies of her future perfect family. Every day, every journey was just time to be endured as she awaited Prince Charming.  My father (his own family story pretty fucked) sought approval and attention by being charming and successful. My mom arrived at his college when he was a senior.  Her desire for a great husband/father of future kids and his desperate need to feel admired and adored drew them together like crazy magnets. They were young,  beautiful and their emotional wounds fit together nicely.  Their courtship was rushed because the Vietnam War was getting serious and men were being drafted left & right. Mom dropped out of college and followed her dashing husband to officer training school and then his miraculous not-Vietnam duty station.  Separated from family, friends and the familiarity of (their) native culture, knowing at any moment my father could be sent to a not-so-distant war, the newlyweds thrived in their 'us vs. the world' bubble.  Two souls savoring life with the intense high that blooms in defiance of mortality and fortune.  The war (and best part of their marriage) ends and they return to their native land.  Without the stimulation of exotic climes, shared isolation and the impending but unpredictable call of war, they (subconsciously) decide to have a baby. My mom would be the mother she always wanted to have, my father would fulfill expected gender demands of the times (receiving appproval from family & society). A son is born.  Glorious future awaits! Father goes back to school and gets his degree after the war and starts his career. Mom follows him around the country and plays Happy Homemaker. Three years later, I am born.  If things froze in time at that point, the story would end acceptably. The quietude of a normal life probably would have avoided the incredible pressures and unbearable strains on two flawed people; pressures and strains that eventually led to a miasma of pain and hopelessness, a broken family, and my chilchildlessnes  Soon after my birth, my father's first born son started displaying some atypical behaviors. His unsettling actions and interactions were written off as 1) residue from the latest move,  2) jealousy over a new baby and 3) the normal impatience and frustration expressed by any toddler.  His parents distracted themselves by focusing on his precocious intelligence and the new baby. His unusual interactions were explained away; in retrospect, they were recognized as clear beacons indicating trouble ahead. The lull of his sweetness was welcomed after one of his uncontrollable rage episodes.    To be continued...after a good night's sleep, if anyone is interested in the continuation.  TLDR: saga of mental fucked-up-ery moving through the generations, with a guesstimated starting point of my great-grandfather's suicide."

I believe this sub can be much more valuable and productive with its energies devoted to discovery and creativity.  These questions have been covered hundreds of times in this sub alone, millions of times in easily accessed literature.  Every situation is different, but generally speaking we all suffer and enjoy the same human conditions.  The minutia make us as individuals but they do not make our experiences unrelatable by any stretch."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Y6Y1Y9,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:12:26 2014 UTC,Maybe then someone should make an /r/askhtngaf for application based questions and keep the general ideas for this sub.
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Binerexis,5,Thu Dec 11 15:51:47 2014 UTC,"Dude, if this post annoys you then ignore it.   Also, you're caring WAY too much about this."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Lytalm,1 point,Wed Nov 5 16:38:44 2014 UTC,I'm just fucking sick of subs doing this banning of content just because 3 people got annoyed by it. It's not something that can be ignored when you go to a sub to make a post and then all of a sudden you aren't allowed to because some random person complained to a mod. It's just fucking annoying.
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Y6Y1Y9,2,Wed Nov 5 18:36:35 2014 UTC,Why do you think only three people were annoyed by it?
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Y6Y1Y9,3,Thu Nov 6 13:00:17 2014 UTC,"Because if it actually was a huge majority of people who were, this rule would have went into effect a long time ago. Or would have been part of the rules from the start if it was that universally annoying."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,exoduslife,3,Fri Nov 7 04:46:06 2014 UTC,"But if people find it annoying enough now that there's a rule against it, surely there's a majority who don't like it, right?"
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,stalcode,2,Fri Nov 7 08:52:42 2014 UTC,"No. Based on how i've seen this same thing go down on many other subs. It's a minority of people who were loud and vocal about their annoyance over a certain type of post. Posting many comments about how annoying the posts were and the mods caved to those people so they wouldn't have to deal with the ""omg i hate these posts blah blah blah"" from those few. Rather than have them just skip over the posts and read ones they do want to see (Which is not hard because the help me posts are easily identifiable by their titles) like a normal person would. They then make a big enough fuss till the sub caters to them.  I would think there's plenty who disagree with this silly rule, but i'm not making any assumptions that those people would actually put forth the effort to get it changed. Especially since it wouldn't work. It's pretty clear the mods made up their mind and picked their side. They responded to one of my comments on here and let me know they've had this rule in consideration for like a year and a half or whatever. Now that they've made the decision, i don't think they'd all of a sudden go back on it. I've more or less finished venting my frustration over the stupid decision and now that i'm done venting, i've accepted the fact that this sub doesn't want people like me here making posts. So i don't check the sub any more. Which im sure every one here who's content with the rule is pretty happy with anyway."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Razzamafoo,1 point,Fri Nov 7 14:10:58 2014 UTC,"But if they implemented a rule for a vocal minority before, wouldn't a vocal and active majority be able to get it changed back?  If they've been considering this rule change for more than a year, can it really be blamed on a recent vocal minority?  Why wouldn't the sub want people like you? Do/Did you make a habit of making ""pls help"" threads?"

I've decided to stop being a pushover. Now I feel disliked and I need advice on HTNGAF along the way  How not to give a fuck about getting my gall bladder taken out.  How to say no without coming off as an asshole?  Are the mods going to go through each post and decide on what's deemed a ""Help me"" post?  I think there should be a quality check of said help posts instead of just  carpet-bombing all of them; like many users in the comments have indicated they will continue with help me posts and i'm taking a guess here but new users will also continue to do so and be disappointed to find their posts removed due to this rule.  I vote for a quality check approach; if a help me question gets a few downvotes remove it but if it has merit let it stick. Downvotes mean that the community doesn't agree with the validity of a help-cry and therefore the moderators can remove it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Binerexis,1 point,Thu Nov 27 07:03:47 2014 UTC,"I agree. Just like deciding on what is and isn't advice, it's incredibly hard to distinguish between what is and isn't a good quality question. That being said it's incredibly idiotic to carpet bomb them: them it drives away new users, discourages discussion on legitimate issues, and prevents more people from giving less fucks.  It seems the mods want to turn this sub into a circle-jerk for those who already don't give fucks. Might as well rename this to: ""Idon'tgiveafuck"" since we're not gonna actually tell anyone how to not give a fuck."

howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,sadfacetimes,1 point,Mon Nov 24 15:59:10 2014 UTC,I think the point of the philosophy behind this subreddit is to not give a fuck about things that ruin your life simply by giving a fuck about them.  This isn't at the exclusion of giving a fuck about things that matter to you and don't hurt you in the process of giving a fuck about them.
howtonotgiveafuck,2lbt7t,Trosso,9,Sat Mar 14 18:36:10 2015 UTC,"I personally agree with keeping this a ""philosophy"" subreddit, and those with ""help me"" posts have many places to go to. r/socialskills, r/seduction, r/fitness, r/selfimprovement.

I can appreciate the reasons behind this moderation decision, but I can also see benefit in being to able to ask for specific help with a problem.  Thus, I was just wondering if there IS a place on reddit that is appropriate for ""help me"" posts, preferably something close to spirit of this subreddit.  It seems like giving and asking for advice are two sides of the same coin and I would probably frequent both places, even if from a moderation standpoint, it made sense to keep them separate.  I just don't know if what I'm describing exists on this site."

Then I see this sticky, and I'm just so disappointed. What a slap in the face to new people who come to this sub looking for advice. I'm glad all of you who agree with this decision have all been HNTGAF since birth, and therefore have never seeked counsel from those more experienced. Good luck not becoming completely stagnant when you stop getting new posters, and it's just the same people posting over and over like some fucked up echo chamber.   I thought this was an open community of not giving a fuckers.  I used to recommend this sub all the time IRL and on reddit, because I thought it was such a great philosophy that could really help people.

howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,befron,40,Tue Nov 4 02:41:26 2014 UTC,"Here are some quotes from I Am That by Nisargadatta Maharaj related to this:  Do not try to make yourself happy, rather question your very search for happiness. It is because you are not happy that you want to be happy. Find out why you are unhappy. Because you are not happy you seek happiness in pleasure; pleasure brings in pain and therefore you call it worldly; you then long for some other pleasure, without pain, which you call divine. In reality, pleasure is but a respite from pain.  Pleasure depends on things, happiness does not. As long as we believe that we need things to make us happy, we shall also believe that in their absence we must be miserable. Mind always shapes itself according to its beliefs. Hence the importance of convincing oneself that one need not be prodded into happiness; that, on the contrary, pleasure is a distraction and a nuisance, for it merely increases the false conviction that one needs to have and do things to be happy, when in reality it is just the opposite. But why talk of happiness at all? You do not think of happiness except when you are unhappy. A man who says ""Now I am happy"" is between two sorrows, past and future. This happiness is mere excitement caused by relief from pain. Real happiness is utterly unselfconscious. It is best expressed negatively as: ""there is nothing wrong with me, I have nothing to worry about""."
howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,bd31,4,Tue Nov 4 08:00:34 2014 UTC,Thank you for that reading
howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,DrDeath008,2,Tue Nov 4 08:37:34 2014 UTC,The problem with this argument is that it ignores the possibility of people seeking out pleasure knowing it to be fleeting and as an addition to happiness (or in addition to the lack of unhappiness in this case I guess) instead of a replacement.  Not to mention that sometimes simple or hedonistic pleasures can turn into deeper experiences that actually bring something of substance into your life even in the long run. A classic example often cited being tripping on LSD or MDMA.
howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,Anaraky,1 point,Tue Nov 4 17:48:36 2014 UTC,I interpreted both quotes as invitations to examine why one may be seeking pleasure.
howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,bd31,10,Tue Nov 4 19:59:05 2014 UTC,"The point of being human is that we achieve happiness through higher pleasures. While sex, drugs, and rock and roll seem like they bring happiness in life (and they do for a short while), ultimately we will all find true contentment in other things (like a beautiful piece of music or a beautiful person). If by hedonism you are referring to actively seeking out higher pleasure than yes, I agree its a legitimate lifestyle. Otherwise, I would disagree with a lifestyle focused on animalistic pleasures. Hope that made sense, I'm hella tired haha."

Those who pursue pornography, sex, alcohol, drugs, video games etc without restraint become slaves to it. Years of research on pornography explains how it absolutely fucks you up royally. Go ask someone on NoFap if pornography helped them to connect to the world around them. Ask an alcoholic if he is closer to his family. Ask a drug addict if he has found his higher pleasure. Ask a sex addict if he feels fulfilled, being little better than a toy in his own eyes and in the eyes of others.  I understand what you are thinking, I thought it once too. It's a mistake, don't live your life this way. Once you are older, you will merely hate yourself for living such a pathetic life, little better than the animals you eat."

howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,ek_ladki,5,Wed Nov 5 20:40:21 2014 UTC,"All that really matters is that you follow a system of ethics, imo. You can live and enjoy life in any way you please, as long as its cohesive with your morality and fulfills you.   I highly recommend ethical egoism, as it maintains the concept of rational self interest, while still allowing the possibility of acting kindly towards others, and encouraging it.  I think the root answer to your concern is that, unless you live in the woods completely isolated from society, our actions are deeply entrenched in each others lives. Everything you do affects everybody else, so it behooves you to act in a way that will positively affect them.   The selfish gene, by Richard Dawkins, addresses this with more scientific research and evidence, if you are interested."

It may not be the lifestyle for me, but I don't much care what the guy next door does behind closed doors- it doesn't concern me. If he prefers this route, no reason not to take it.

howtonotgiveafuck,2l81ox,dmitri_popov,2,Tue Nov 4 19:36:22 2014 UTC,"The word hedonism has (at least) two accepted meanings:  1) Hedonism as seeking an excess of sensory pleasures. This is kind of the accepted pop culture understanding of hedonism. Think of a rock star who shoots heroine and sleeps with a new groupie each night. I believe that this philosophy falls short for several reasons, not the least of which being that generally there are inherent dangers that come part and parcel with the pleasure seeking. Also, there is the problem of ""never enough."" No matter how many blonde hotties you bang, there will always be another one that you need to conquer. Remember, the world was not enough for Alexander the great.  2) The second meaning of hedonism is simply that (human) happiness is all that really matters. Now, this leaves open how one is to pursue and achieve happiness. It might range from the aforementioned ""rock star"" lifestyle to a life of resignation and minimalism like that of the Greek philosopher Epicurus. In both cases, they desire happiness, but how they try to achieve it differs widely, and perhaps likely this difference is because we have to experiment with multiple lifestyles and philosophies before we can nail one down that works for us.  Either way, I think most non-religious modern people believe that happiness is all important (even Aristotle hinted at this more than 2000 years ago). The question is how to achieve happiness.  Now, if by hedonism you mean I will do anything for happiness, ignoring all social mores and norms or religious precepts, then yeah, I guess I'm a hedonist."

howtonotgiveafuck,2l5icz,DocTaxus,6,Tue Nov 4 04:10:16 2014 UTC,"let it go.   I had a friend who got really into Mayahana Buddhism and we had some really cool conversations about Buddhist precepts.  One of the things we discussed was letting thoughts slip by you. When you have a thought, have it and be done with it. Don't chase after it, don't try to catch it and hold onto it, don't wallow in it.  So, OP, in that moment where you are thinking, ""Shit, that person is laughing at me,"" just let the thought go. Don't spend anymore time on it, don't feed it. MOVE ON to the next thought.  I'm not saying it's easy, but like a lot of things once you get the hang of it you can find your groove. I actually think, and often say, ""Fuck it."" For me that's not a negative phrase, it's a positive step forward. It's become a mantra/trigger.   ""Oh man, I didn't go fast enough in traffic and that guy honked at me and I look and feel like an ass. Nobody's hurt and everybody fucks up. Eh, fuck it.""  If you have trouble letting go, try focusing on the next thought. Taking action is really helpful, it can be something as simple as playing a song, doing some push ups, or getting off the Internet. Having an alternative, the next thing to invest your energy in is very helpful.  If you are feeling really hung up on something you know isn't important (but feels important to you), try doing something to counteract your bad moment. In my above example, maybe I decide to let the next guy into my lane in traffic. Or maybe I compliment my roommate when I get home, even if I am in a shitty mood.   This stuff may not work for you, OP, but try it out. Try whatever out--learn what works for you. And you only get better with practice. Good luck."

howtonotgiveafuck,2l2qq4,Cam_shablam,44,Sun Nov 2 16:57:39 2014 UTC,"I don't think drinking more is the answer because then you're anchoring your positive emotions with alcohol so you would end up feeling you need to drink every time to feel good and have a great time and that can lead to negative things in life.   The only to lose self control is to do it slowly otherwise you will jerk yourself back into your self controlling autopilot. So the trick is to go slow and take little steps.   You know the little voice in your head that tells you, ""oh you shouldn't say that"" or ""oh you shouldn't do that."" Learn to defy that voice, one step at a time. Everyday, do something which you don't want to do and slowly make that voice fade away and with enough practice, you wouldn't have a buffer between your thought and actions.   It sounds like a bit of work but once you are done with it, you feel truly liberated."

howtonotgiveafuck,2l2qq4,Vacantibus,7,Sun Nov 2 19:35:02 2014 UTC,"There is a part of your brain that has formed these neurotic habits of over-analyzation and hyper-calculation. The rest of your brain has learned the habit of obeying these commands.  The trick is to identify the part of your mind that these feelings or directives come from, and work to directly disobey it. You must prune your thoughts, in the same way you'd prune a plant.  I used to think about where my hands were all the time, whether they were where they were ""supposed to be"". I got in the neurotic habit of agonizing over the question, which of course made it impossible to relax. Even if my hand placement might not have appeared weird to others, I'd thought so much about it that it seemed weird to me.  To change, I had to prune my thoughts. As soon as I realized I was thinking about my hand placement in that neurotic way, I would immediately think of something else. Not ""don't think about my hands""; rather, things like ""refocus on something normal. What is the person talking about? What can I ask about? What are my plans for the day?"" Grasp at the first normal thought you can, and leave the neurotic one behind. It might take a lot of effort--but with true effort, progress is inevitable. You must very deliberately take your train of thought and force it to jump tracks. Again and again.  The interesting thing about pruning your thoughts like this is that your brain will learn to do it for you. You'd be surprised at how quickly you can overwrite an old habit with a new one, as long as you're deliberate and consistent enough in trying and intending to do so. There is a lot of power in even just the firmly held intention to change, if you can visualize it clearly and don't forget about it too quickly.  So when you find yourself over-focusing on these things you'd rather not focus on, refocus on something that's simply more worth your time. What is your conversational partner saying? What open-ended questions could you ask? What might you say that relates? What's going on around you? Where do you plan to go? Do you have anything you need to do, anything coming up you should think through a little more? For every neurotic thought you have, you can find a normal thought to replace it. A thought you can be more proud of.  Even if you jump your thought-train-tracks for only a few seconds, and you're back on the neurotic track after that moment, you've been successful. For a few moments you were not neurotic, and you were able to focus on what you want to focus on (even if you want to focus on deliberately relaxing. This sounds like an oxymoron but it's not).  Hold firmly in your mind the intention, and regularly work toward the goal, to maximize your non-neurotic thoughts. Any brief moment where you've thought thoughts you'd rather have thought--that is a victory, and with each victory you will improve your skill in getting to that mindset. Thinking in a certain way is only a matter of building a habit, and your days are filled with opportunities to practice."

First and foremost, silence that nagging voice that taunts you when you fucked up in an interaction or embarassed yourself. When it starts, just silence it. Occupy your brain with something else; distract yourself from listening to it. It takes practice but it gets easier.  Also, take a look around you and realize how often the most social people really don't think out their words. They let it flow. While it's hard to flip on the flow, try saying things you'd normally censor out (not the horribly non pc things but things you didn't say for fear of seeming boring or self absorbed.) I know I'm stuck listening to people tell stories I didn't ask to hear all the time, and most of the time, I enjoy it. So tell that story you censored out. Even if the ending fizzles out.  Start saying what you feel or what's going on internally. Sometimes an awkward situation can easily be diffused and salvaged by pointing it out. ""Sorry, slightly awkward, but your eyes are just so pretty."" ""Wow self, way to fuck that one up."" garbled sentence ""Alright, looks like my brain is a little broken today.""

howtonotgiveafuck,2l2qq4,parrotpounder,2,Sun Nov 2 23:41:46 2014 UTC,"Find an activity that is cathartic.   Something that allows you express strong emotions without giving a fuck. I tend to be very calculated and I think far too much about everything, let alone social situations.   To help release tension and simply get out of my own head for a bit I like to engage in cathartic activities. For me, these are dancing like a maniac around the house while jamming to some tunes and writing.   When I dance I'm simply alone in my house listening to some kind of rock and just going nuts. I'm certain that I look like a fool, but far too many people dance in order to try and look cool. Real dancing, the kind that releases bound up emotions, should look a bit chaotic and ridiculous. It feels good to just let go and go nuts with my body for a bit and I don't have to feel embarrassed because no one is around.   Writing is something I just began recently. I never really attempted to write fiction much before I decided to take a shot at completing national write a novel month. I'm finding that there is something similarly cathartic to just sitting down and expressing different emotions and scenarios through imaginary people. It's odd because it can be a bit tiresome on the mind, but after a good writing session I feel like my stress levels are very low. Almost like a good workout that sucks ass while you're doing it but feels great once your done.   I'm sure there are many other things you could do to tap into some catharsis. Really it just needs to be some sort of activity that allows you to let your emotions spill out without any need for putting on an image or being calculated about it."
howtonotgiveafuck,2l2qq4,PossiblyAsian,2,Mon Nov 3 04:02:37 2014 UTC,The reason you're better socially when you're drunk is that you're not trying as hard. When you are drunk you're not in your own head you're just going along with the conversation. You're self-conscious  when you're sober so during a conversation you're not really listening to what the other person is saying you're trying to think of something to say once they're finished. You need to engage in the conversation and take a genuine interest in the other person. When you actually listen to them then you can ask questions about something they just said and the conversation will be smoother.

You may want to look into meditation, or other techniques to curb anxiety and stress, Qi-Gong for example.  Also, if you are having self-esteem/ self-worth issues or questions, it's not a bad idea to reaffirm your existence by finding a hobby that takes over your life. While the hobby may or may not provide a valuable skill, it gives you something to pour your heart and soul into that will also boost your happiness. ( hobbies that provide a new skill = the best)  I myself do martial arts. I also like to mix beats using protools. While I am not a pro at either, I have made good long lasting connections and relationships. My confidence, and self esteem have never been higher.   I have also learned from my bad relationship history that I needed to be happy with myself before someone else could truly love me.   Fast forward, I am now in a great relationship (1yr in), fully in love. I plan on getting married, and when I think back to the changes I felt like making to myself in my past, it was always due to feeling lonely, and insecure, or having slight PTSD symptoms from losing my sole source of previous happiness. I am not trying to project onto you, I just felt there was some similarity in your post and my life.  I hope you are happy with your new hairstyle, I hope it is boosting your confidence!

Most often, I am asked how I do it by the types of people who would never do this to their hair, but it's the only thing they want to talk with me about.  I love doing my hair this way, but I really dislike the attention that I get. Tends to make me grouchy and short in conversations with strangers. But it also causes friction between me and some people I interact with regularly.

When you find that you're putting off picking up that guitar, calling that person for a date, or going up on stage to read a poem you wrote, that's not a rational decision.  It's a deep-down, primal fear that if you aren't good enough, the herd will laugh at you.  It's the fear that lies and says everyone is watching, they'll all judge you.*  Above all, it's those moments when you wait until you have a good reason not to do the thing.  It's not the feeling of being scared of the consequences of an action.  It's the feeling of being scared of the act itself, and delaying so that you can rationalize not acting.

Most people are cowards, so good for you.  If they say something to you about it, you can say ""yeah what the hell man you didn't even kiss me back"" rather than freak out, have some fun with it"

howtonotgiveafuck,2kxxhq,carlospc,3,Sat Nov 1 15:20:41 2014 UTC,"Um, you no longer need to think about this.  That was one of my first thoughts that your roommate could just be jealous.  Now he is jealous and immature.  $10 he won't say anything because he doesn't want the guy you kissed to know that you like him"
howtonotgiveafuck,2kxxhq,carlospc,3,Sat Nov 1 15:24:37 2014 UTC,"Thank you!!  It's actually made me feel so much better hashing it out like this.  Thanks to you, I have at least 50% fewer fucks to give today"

howtonotgiveafuck,2kxtg2,drawingonmyhands,1 point,Sat Nov 1 08:33:57 2014 UTC,"Using prescription and herbal stuff off-and-on for years, I've learned that anti-anxiety meds aren't as useful as you think.  They can work, but they work by sedating you, and with that comes all the negatives of being sedated.  I have yet to find anything that can kill anxiety but yet leave you 100% functional.  I certainly can't argue the value of a xanax pill if you ware in the middle of a panic attack, but as a daily preventative regimen, this stuff leaves alot to be desired, especially if your stressors are completely real (job anxiety, etc)."

So I'm going to give that a shot! I know meds effect everyone differently, but I won't know until I try right? :)"
