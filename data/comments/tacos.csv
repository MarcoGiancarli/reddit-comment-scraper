tacos,3e5boi,______PUNISHER______,0,Wed Jul 22 01:59:15 2015 UTC,Hard shell tacos aren't real tacos
tacos,3e5boi,nastynip,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:43:52 2015 UTC,"Taco hipster.  Hard shell tacos are delicious. Sadly, I love Mexican food and live really far from Mexico. The tacos I was brought up on were usually the hard shelled variety, and because of them I've grown to love more authentic ones when I have rare access to them.  Hard shell tacos are tacos, even if you prefer some other kind. Don't be a food snob, they're among the worst kind of annoying people."

tacos,3d7oxf,locotxwork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:10 2015 UTC,"I never had allergies when I lived in Albuquerque, but I live in Washington state now and they are crazy. Between the pollen in the warmer months and the mold in the winter I am constantly on some sort of allergy relief quest. And the food is no where near as good. Luckily I learned a lot when I lived there and I cook a lot of my own Mexican food now. Our restaurants suck too. It;s never a good sign when none of the local Mexican restaurants have Mexican people eating there."
tacos,3d7oxf,Zombies_Are_Dead,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"You probably need to eat some local honey and throw down on eating some veggies from the local farmer's market.  Something about eating local pollen and helps your body to adjust.    Also that is the rule of thumb . . ""Where's the best Mexican food?  Look for a restaurant where the Mexicans eat"".....""Where's the best Chinese food?  Look for a place where there are lots of Asians eating""."
tacos,3d7oxf,locotxwork,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"I do need to get some honey, but all the local stuff is out of my budget. All i can get is store stuff for now. And I totally agree on the restaurants. If the people from that culture like it, it's good stuff. Where I used to live my favorite Korean restaurant had minimal English on the menu. The servers spoke nearly no English. It was the best Korean I've ever had. Locally, most people that work at the ""ethnic"" restaurants are American and mostly white. I live in a VERY white city. I am moving at first chance to a city with some diversity again. I miss that so much."

tacos,3clrp4,tripstreet,4,Thu Jul 9 20:17:19 2015 UTC,"No idea on this one, but some of my favorite spots on the north/northwest side at least are El Taco Feliz, Taqueria El Asadero, L'Patron, and Taqueria San Juanito.  We have amazing tacos in Chicago."

tacos,3clrp4,JesteroftheApocalyps,3,Wed Jul 8 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, even though I live in L.A., where taco-making is sublime, the last time I went to Chicago, my friend took me to a Mexican restaurant somewhere near Maxwell street, and they had some bomb tacos.  Likewise, at the Maxwell street market, I was able to buy some rare super-tasty dried chiles that even all my Mexican immigrant cook friends in L.A. had never seen before."
tacos,3clrp4,tripstreet,3,Thu Jul 9 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"I appreciate some cali love for chicago tacos, cuz honestly for some reason most people just assume ours are shit but we have a huge population of mexicans and no shortage of legit authentic taquerias almost EVERYWHERE, including in almost every mexican grocery store, ala OP's delicious pics.  Ive enjoyed the hell out of some LA tacos in my limited experience, but never had anything quite as good as some of the places here.  Those carne asada fries, on the other hand....nothing like that here and boy do I wish there was.  I also enjoy the ubiquity of rolled tacos in southern cali."
tacos,3clrp4,JesteroftheApocalyps,3,Fri Jul 10 06:35:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I might mention however, is here in L.A. you should never buy a taco before nightfall. And if you spent $10 and didn't have some change back for the tip jar, then you are overpaying.   Whereas in Chicago it was regular sit-down restaurants, and pricier. Maybe I missed the other spots, but that was my general experience.  Although I will say that going to El Tepayac in Boyle Heights L.A. and getting a Hollenbeck burrito at 8.a.m. and they give you free shots of tequila while you wait in line is also awesome. Espescially if you have been drinking the night before.  http://manuelseltepeyac.com/"
tacos,3clrp4,tripstreet,2,Fri Jul 10 07:19:48 2015 UTC,"I will save your comment as a reminder for whenever I make it back to LA.  Last time I think I got a 3 taco dinner for 8 or 9 bucks at a tiny little hole in the wall near inglewood somewhere by the airport, and they were very tasty.    If you find yourself in Chicago anytime soon, a few posts up I have a small list of a few of my favorite smaller taquerias on the northside.  Theres so many more, those are just some personal faves (extra high marks for El Taco Feliz, so slept on here).  For downtown taco-action, Rick Bayless' Frontera is amazing (or Xoco for tortas and soup)."
tacos,3clrp4,JesteroftheApocalyps,2,Fri Jul 10 07:30:59 2015 UTC,"Of course Rick Bayless is a God of Mexican food, even out here. His TV  show is on Los Angeles local TV, and I've even seen people that don't speak English glom on to it.  But there are some very good hot-spots for tacos in L.A. that you might have missed. Sounds to me like you were just in the airport area, which I've never heard of having good tacos. You got to come to East L.A. or Echo Park where the crazy good tacos are.   There's also a place (sorry I can't remember the name at the moment) that makes a stewed beef taco. Holy crap they are good!"
tacos,3clrp4,tripstreet,2,Fri Jul 10 08:05:48 2015 UTC,"Also, San Diego/LA burritos >>> San Francisco burritos.

tacos,3b4zfm,EatATaco,2,Fri Jun 26 00:48:21 2015 UTC,"Wait until their August tacos of the month.  It is their best promotion of the year.    Here's what they did last year:   The Barn Burner, available all month, starts things off at level one with Torchy’s rating of a chile pepper x4 (which means it is between 10,000 and 60,000 Scoville units). This taco has grilled beef fajita, bacon, Manzano chili salad, goat cheese and cilantro, topped with Avocado and Diablo Sauce.  Firecracker Shrimp doubles the heat, and is available beginning August 11. It has habanero-battered shrimp, cabbage slaw, candied jalapenos, cotija cheese, cilantro and Diablo mayo.  The Creeper gets a pepper x16 and is available beginning August 18. It has habanero fried chicken with chorizo and chopped bacon, jalapenos, pickled onions, cotija cheese, cilantro and a drizzle of creamy ghost pepper sauce.  The Scalding Pig gets a whopping pepper x32 rating from Torchy’s and is the final taco. You can taste this spicy creation August 25-31, but you may need a sweet-and-spicy Chingnon Margarita to wash it down. It has pork stewed with pasilla and ghost peppers, escabech, jack cheese, cilantro, sour cream and chicharron piece. Served with a dropper of pepper sauce, if you dare.  http://whateverblog.dallasnews.com/2014/08/can-you-handle-the-heat-of-torchys-august-taco-challenge.html/"
tacos,3avdmk,TheLadyEve,3,Tue Jun 23 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I worked in a kitchen with a gal who was raised in New Mexico.  She grew up on a farm her family had had for generations.  Her grandma used to like to boil a goat head, then pick it apart and eat it.  She would tell the kids the dog had been bad."
tacos,3avdmk,2hardtry,2,Wed Jun 24 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"I used to raise goats when I was younger, but that was a small number and it was for milk. We never ate any of them (although we sold some off to be eaten). I can't say I've had goat's head, but they sell sheep heads at the same store I got the goat. Not sure what my husband would say if I brought one of those home..."
tacos,3avdmk,2hardtry,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:52:13 2015 UTC,"They can actually be pretty awesome.  In northern Mexico they do a pit barbecue dish called barbacoa.  It can be made with goat, sheep or cow's heads.  After singeing and washing the head, you rub it with achiote condimentado or a chile paste, then wrap it in a burlap sack that's been washed and dried.  Once the fire in the earthen pit is reduced to coals, you toss in some fresh leaves, then the head sacks, and then cover all with soil and tamp it down.  Dig that up a few hours later and make tacos.  I'm down for most of the meat, but fuck if I'm going to eat the eyes or brains.  Just no."

I know that a small % of people actually have an issue with the taste of cilantro, but since it's a vital component to almost any Mexican (and many other countries) cuisine, I find it hard to believe that most people don't like it.   And even harder to understand how green onion is a replacement, the flavors and textures are completely different. Only the color is the same, but there are a lot of green items that could be used."

There are approximately one hundred and fourteen known species endemic to Mexico,  where the plant is a common ingredient in numerous Mexican cuisine dishes. The nopal pads can be eaten raw or cooked, used in marmalades, soups stews and salads, as well as being used for traditional medicine or as fodder for animals. Farmed nopales are most often of the species Opuntia ficus-indica, although the pads of almost all Opuntia species are edible. The other part of the nopal cactus that is edible is the fruit called in Spanish the tuna, and in English the ""prickly pear"".

tacos,36bm4t,locotxwork,2,Mon May 18 15:47:49 2015 UTC,Why did you separate the juice from the meat only to add the juice again and broil til it reduced?  Did you maybe skim the fat first?  That step was a little unclear
tacos,36bm4t,Hillside_Strangler,4,Mon May 18 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"Juice separated from meat completely and only drizzled on top, not added all back in.  The goal is a crusty exterior and tender interior. The rendered fat from slow cooking basically submerges the meat in the juice and you want ""dry"" pieces with nice crust."
tacos,36bm4t,Hillside_Strangler,1 point,Mon May 18 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok.  I use the gravy separator a lot while slow-cooking and will sometimes make a sort of a reduction out of the jus."

tacos,35pwol,Keaper,5,Tue May 12 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"First I heated some oil up in a pot.  Then I grabbed the corn tortillas and dunked them in, one at a time, for about 20 or 30 seconds each.  After that I stacked them with paper towels in between each of them.  This left them fried, but still pliable.  I could easily fold them.  So I put some taco meat and shredded cheese in the middle of each one and folded them closed, holding them for a moment to get them to 'stick' closed a little bit.  Then I heated up a little oil in a skillet and fried the tacos for about 30 or 45 seconds on each side.  I transferred them to a plate covered with paper towels and again wicked away as much grease as I could.    Then I just wedged them open, added salsa, sour cream, and lettuce, and ate them!  It was the first time I've made tacos like this, and I was pretty worried they'd come out horrifically greasy, but they really didn't!  Maybe a little greasier than pre-made corn shells, but not bad at all."

tacos,303q97,zworkaccount,5,Tue Mar 24 12:25:29 2015 UTC,"That is awesome you make your own masa.  I would love to do that, but it looks pretty labor intensive?    I use masa flour from Walmart, and follow the instructions on the back.  I believe the recipe for four tortillas is:   1 cup flour 1/3 cup water 1/2 tsp salt (this may not be right, but it does call for a small amount of salt)   Then I just mix it with my hands.  If the mixture is right, it should pretty much not stick to your hands.  Add a bit more water if it is super crumbly or a bit more flour if it is too sticky.  If you want to make a bunch in a row before cooking them, it works better to let the dough sit for about an hour before pressing them (otherwise they tend to stick together if you stack them).  Otherwise you can just make them one at a time.  Here is my original /r/tacos post from my first time making them.  The imgur has 5 pictures in it.  There were some great comments on there about other things to do with masa.  My tortilla press was bought at a carniceria and it came with the little plastic sheets, but I've heard you can use Freezer ziploc bags (cut into two sheets) as well as plastic grocery bags.  I put my electric stove on medium and cook them on a cast iron skillet.  About 50 seconds on the first side, and a little less when you flip it.  It's easy to look on the bottom to see if it's browning or not.    When they are done I put a kitchen towel down on a plate and cover them as they come out of the skillet.    My daughter loves to dump in the flour and mix it and I always make her a little quesadilla from one of the tortillas (she's 2 1/2)."
tacos,303q97,LinFTW,2,Tue Mar 24 17:57:12 2015 UTC,If you can buy one of these: http://www.amazon.com/Tortilla-Warmer-12-Insulated-microwave/dp/B0025UIDA2 the tortillas will stay even warmer and fresher as you take them off and put them in the bag. It's pretty awesome!

Technically though it is not masa flour, but it is an ""instant"" mix product that is basically dried maza that reconstitutes with water.    if you really want to get crazy, you can make actual masa, which is not really made from a flour, but is made into a dough in place when the kernals are ground up.  ive done it before, and its a lot of work and not really that worth it, however it was a fun project.    basically what you are doing is taking dried corn, like the nice, big kernal kind that is often times purple or a mixture of colors, and you give it a hot soak in a boneash solution, calcium hydroxide. this digests down the internals of the kernels and makes the nutrients accessible to our bodies/guts.  this proces of turning the corn kernals into hominy is called nixtamalization. then from there you rinse it really well and either cook up the hominy or grind it to your purposes.  i used a food processor. it tasted amazing, but it is a lot of work.  i ate half of the hominy batch by keeping it whole and putting it in soups and salsa frescas. the otehr half i made masa with mixed results. now i just buy masa from the tortillerias around town. the whol hominy is good though and more worth it."
tacos,303q97,Leland_,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"That sounds awesome. I think when I started getting into this I watched a video about nixtamalization.    On one of my other posts, someone suggested getting some hominy and pureeing it and then adding some of it to my mixture to give it a stronger corn flavor.  I think I will definitely try this.  Thanks for chattin'."
tacos,303q97,ebo113,2,Tue Mar 24 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"Next time, instead of tapatío and tabasco (which we use for snacks, fruit cocktails and seafood) try this quick recipe for a salsa tatemada (burnt salsa). Put a tomatoe, 1/4 of an onion, small garlic and a jalapeno on a hot grill turning them around until they're all black on the outside. Take them all in the blender with a bit of water just to help the blender going and salt to taste. You should just blend it in short bursts, we traditionally do this on the molcajete (our ancient mortar made out of volcanic rock) so we end with a thick sauce.  If you don't like it too hot, you could just remove the jalapeno veins and seed.  Grettings from Acapulco..."

tacos,2z4y2z,hernanderson,2,Sun Mar 15 16:55:23 2015 UTC,Burger King has already tried their hand at the taco game. It was probably 12-13 years ago the BK had them were I was living. (Northern California) I also distinctly remember there being a sign at a McDonalds for tacos once. Must have been a test market because it was only there for maybe a week.
tacos,2z4y2z,voon,2,Mon Mar 16 12:38:21 2015 UTC,"I'm from San Diego and I'm gonna admit something that San Diegans aren't supposed to say, but LA and Orange County have it all over San Diego because all of their taco shops have burgers.  Del Taco is an example of it. They have Del Taco in San Diego, but San Diego isn't a Del Taco place. They merged with Naugles back in the day who had kickass Mexican as well as burgers.  Most places you go in LA or OC that are independents you can get Mexican and American.  Sometimes you see a combo like George Burgers who have Mexican and Greek, but they're more of a burger joint.   Burger King is on the right track if they add Mexican to the menu. Carl's Jr did it with Green Burrito and that's the only way to get me into a CJ's now. Their burgers (like BK's) are shite. But the Green Burrito stuff is awesome, even for a chain.   If BK can fire up those broilers and give us real steak, chicken and pork, chop that shit up with some cilantro, onion and lime and put it on a tortilla in their stupid steamers (instead of the meat, yuck) - they've got a winner.  Are you listening Burger King?  Also put some god damned chili on your burgers like Tommy's. And stop using horrible meat and then steaming it into even more horribleness."

If I was going to do this in a restaurant or food truck (tell me the notion didn't cross your mind), I'd place the cold taco meat and some grated jack cheese in a food processor and pulse it into crumbs, in batches.  Then I'd add a small amount of jarred salsa and sour cream, just enough so it would hold together.  If I was making 100 of these per day, I'd use a foodservice sauce gun with a 1/2"" or 5/8"" aperture to extrude a line of the meat mixture on the dough rounds.  I'd keep the doughnuts refrigerated during service, and fry them to order.  You could also brush the doughnuts with an egg wash, then roll in Doritos crumbs (or any tortilla chip) before frying.  Cheese stuffed Doritos are now a thing...  Your cutter doesn't have to be a 1-day-use tool.  If it's not dishwasher safe, just dip it in a sanitizing solution of 1 capful bleach to 1 gallon water, then wash with soap and water.  That would satisfy any health department in the US (provided it's a foodsafe plastic)."

tacos,2ynbbw,Cdresden,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"It uses a fry bread rather than a tortilla.  Basically you roll out a baking powder leavened dough into a flat round shape, then throw it in a deep fryer or a pot of hot oil, and it puffs up.  Navajo taco fillings are typically first a thick mixture of ground beef taco meat and refried beans, then shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese and tomatoes.

tacos,2ynbbw,Cdresden,2,Fri Mar 13 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"Taco Bell's food products and terminology are only obliquely related to Mexican and Southwestern food.  A chalupa is a type of wide boat, and in Mexican cuisine it's a small, fried oblong of masa dough, often with a slight rim or edge to hold the toppings.  Some time in the 70s, Mexican American cuisine started using the term chalupa to refer to the sort of fried flour tortilla used for taco salads.  In the 90s Taco Bell started using a thick flour tortilla for tacos that they called a gordita (also something different in Mexican cuisine), then later they started frying it and called it a chalupa.  Fry bread is a bit different in that it's thrown in the deep fryer raw, rather than being baked first.  So it has more moisture, and it puffs up a lot more."

tacos,2xatgp,jmorlin,8,Fri Feb 27 01:11:48 2015 UTC,Looks good but did you heat those tortillas up at all?
tacos,2xatgp,icecrmsocialist,5,Fri Feb 27 03:07:48 2015 UTC,"No, and I immediately regretted it."
tacos,2xatgp,icecrmsocialist,3,Fri Feb 27 03:40:51 2015 UTC,If you have a gas stove just hit them with direct heat over the burner for about 20 seconds a side.

tacos,2xatgp,myfault,2,Fri Feb 27 19:00:10 2015 UTC,I think I could drink Cholula straight. It's so damn good.
tacos,2xatgp,LaVidaEsUnaBarca,2,Fri Feb 27 19:03:07 2015 UTC,Put them in a plastic bag and heat them in a microwave for 20 to 30 seconds. That's what I do when I'm too lazy to do them in the stove.
tacos,2xatgp,locotxwork,0,Fri Feb 27 10:16:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have to toast a little those tortillas."
tacos,2x4iw4,SeldomWrong,4,Wed Feb 25 16:33:27 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible picture, but these are some of the best tacos I've eaten anywhere. They give you a tremendous amount of meat, cheese, and grilled onions. (Also avocado, cilantro, and salsa) Best part is each taco is only $1.15 (used to be a $1 :C)"

tacos,2x4iw4,Sad_Enchilada,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah it's a ton of cheese, but there is even more meat hiding underneath. Next time I need to take a better picture."
