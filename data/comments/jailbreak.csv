jailbreak,3e2cok,CaptainCaucasian,110,Tue Jul 21 12:35:52 2015 UTC,Hats off to CokePokes. I've had phantom since it came out. He's always emailed me back asap whenever I had a problem. I also donated to him not only to remove ads but also so he can keep up the awesome work he does
jailbreak,3e2cok,Oobermann,36,Tue Jul 21 12:55:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. He is always pushing updates and new content and is very responsive. The ads in phantom never bothered me but i bought a license just for the sake of giving him some money. I recommend anybody who has not bought a license to do so after this issue is resolved. I know from his twitter that his dad has been in the hospital and the income from phantom is helping him a lot with paying for that.
jailbreak,3e2cok,Oobermann,15,Tue Jul 21 13:07:20 2015 UTC,I'm not going to lie I have no idea how to code but I know there are over 200+ differences that they have to look at to pinpoint why the whole locking people's snapchat happened. So hats off to them both
jailbreak,3e2cok,MrRom92,12,Tue Jul 21 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"I almost never pay for any jailbreak tweaks because of things like this happening, and I've been burned too many times on Cydia purchases that are no longer maintained. That said, when a dev is responsive and in tune with the community like this, it earns a lot of respect from me. If he really does push an update which slides past snapchats new rules, I will be purchasing a license for sure."
jailbreak,3e2cok,DarKbaldness,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:51 2015 UTC,Why not purchase one now for all the support he's done and for putting up with this current Snapchat update?
jailbreak,3e2cok,MrRom92,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:06 2015 UTC,No offense but I don't feel like paying for a product I may not be able to use. If it works again then I'm all for it.
jailbreak,3e2cok,DarKbaldness,4,Tue Jul 21 17:30:37 2015 UTC,No offense but I'm glad there are proactive people out in the world instead of just reactive people.
jailbreak,3e2cok,expedience,2,Tue Jul 21 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"It's not even that man. I get that people need funds but without a guarantee it will work, why would anyone pay? It's like buying a game you physically can't play until the developer fixes it, nobody would do that.   Although I guess a lot of morons pre order."
jailbreak,3e2cok,Acidschnee,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:48 2015 UTC,You would think no one would do that but some of the early access games dont work at all on steam and people still buy them.

jailbreak,3e2cok,DarKbaldness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:43 2015 UTC,This isn't a preorder though. This is a product that has been supported for the entirety of its existence and the developer needs support now more than ever.

In general I try to avoid speaking for /u/hizinfiz and /u/ibbignerd, out of respect for them as individuals who have their own thoughtful opinions and ideas, but it's pretty uncontroversial to say that as moderators we share a goal to be fair about our rules.  As a person working for SaurikIT, I aim to support a healthy subreddit because my company's mission is to support jailbreaking (as a big part of supporting open computing for closed platforms). Having a fair rule about copyright infringement and piracy is a component of supporting the legality and legitimacy of jailbreaking."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,beetling,4,Tue Jul 21 12:07:56 2015 UTC,"The explanation of the rule, even with your recent amendments, does not make the primary reason for not supporting piracy clear.   Just read the first paragraph back and pick out the 1 reason why piracy isn't allowed. The way it is written makes it look like its revenue loss, which as you've stated in the comments here, isn't the case.   That's not to say that it shouldn't be A reason, just not THE reason, which in my eyes should be the issue you've referenced here.  I think that argument is irrefutable, and the fact that the courts made this distinction should be the absolute paramount reason for not supporting piracy here at /r/jailbreak and the rule 1 explantion should reflect that, which again, I don't think it does."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,beetling,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestion; I can work to make the legality/legitimacy reason more clear in the extended explanation.

Here's the Wikipedia summary of this."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,beetling,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:11 2015 UTC,"Very interesting read. I find it interesting knowing now that the anti-piracy rule is there as more of a precautionary measure to protect the legality of jailbreaking than a way to protect revenue. I think one thing to take away from this thread is the disparity between the subjective morality of piracy in the jailbreak community and the objective legality, which we have a responsibility to maintain for the greater good of jailbreaking.  I'm curious, is it possible to view a list of exemption proposals?  Has Apple even attempted to file an exemption proposal."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,m1kehuntertz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:05:13 2015 UTC,"The Copyright Office has a website about the current and previous DMCA exemption processes - some aspects of it are slightly unintuitive to navigate (make sure to click the buttons on the right), but all the information is there.

To keep impartiality, she doesn't even give an opinion on the matter as to how it should be handled. This is one thing that I was very surprised by when I came on as a moderator 8 months ago.

Whether someone agrees with this aspect or that with the piracy thing (sharing ipas, youtube videos, cracked tweaks, etc), there is no doubt that as a whole its to protect the company and keep the lawyers away.   The consensus seems to be stealing from jailbreak devs is an automatic no-no. The rest falls under whether it will (a) get lawyers involved or (b) make the case harder for jailbreaking to become legal. The second is extremely sketchy considering that windows and android phones can already be used for piracy."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,justscottsid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"We also have to protect our subreddit and essentially reddit the company from lawyers as well. Back when Rick-Deckard and a couple other mods were in charge of this sub (4 years ago I believe), they allowed all content including piracy. This resulted in the subreddit getting banned. Saurik had to fight to have the sub reinstated and one of the contingencies was that we wouldn't allow piracy content on the sub.   As I'm sure everyone can tell, this is a very hard thing to moderate. What is piracy and what isn't is not a cut and dry thing. Us moderators have been thinking about this issue for a very long time and it is so hard to say what is okay and what isn't.

All that is fine and I mean I get it. But you cant really expect the end users to agree with it all. We are talking about hypocrisy. This really has to do with legal issues and lawyers.

jailbreak,3e0wh8,beetling,-1,Tue Jul 21 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"Copyright law is a complicated and messy thing that even lawyers and courts struggle with (I suggest reading the archives of this copyright newsletter if you're curious to get a taste!), and /r/jailbreak's rule #1 tries to draw a reasonable line out of that mess - interestingly, there's actually no simple binary here. I'm pretty busy today with moderating Snapchat discussions, but I'll try to explain...partly because I really enjoy thinking about the complications of copyright and trying to help explain them.  To address torrent clients: the torrent clients on the default repositories are neutral tools that have the exact same support for any kind of content, legitimate or illegitimate, and their marketing and features do not encourage use for piracy. It's legal for that kind of tool to exist. The default repositories allow them.  That's different from a standard app piracy tool, which is marketed for piracy and specifically supports pirated material. Sometimes people consider use for free apps to not be piracy, but that's still copyright infringement (since those apps are being redistributed without permission from the developers) and involves cracking DRM (since even free App Store apps have DRM), which is additionally prohibited by the DMCA.  Adblockers don't involve copyright infringement, and they seem to be probably legal and not considered fraud, which is why the default repositories allow them.  It's good to note that rule #1 isn't about revenue loss. There are tons of forms of revenue loss that nearly everyone considers legal, such as publishing a competing product, and copyright infringement of a free app often doesn't involve revenue loss. Rule #1 is about copyright and to some degree about related forms of fraud.  Edit: I updated the long-form explanation of the rule to include some of these details for clarity."

Yes, there may be a large amount of people that use piracy tools on jailbroken devices, but as long as we can show that there is a huge jailbreak community ( 2 if you include /r/iOSThemes ) that has nothing to do with piracy, we are demonstrating that illegal activity is not the purpose of jailbreaking.

Saurik and others could even face lawsuits, fines, and jail if continued use of this piracy tool (referring to what they would call Cydia) could be linked to them.

I can use a YouTube downloader or a torrenting program to download content legally, but redistributing specific files without knowledge or consent is piracy (whether the creator/owner cares or not), so to not become liable, the entire subreddit must obey these rules (and the moderators must act quickly to correct possible instances of piracy), lest there be potential legal issues. I don't like this any more than anyone else here, but it is absolutely necessary.   On a side note, the strict anti-piracy rule is probably also incredibly important in showing that jailbreaking should be/remain legal by demonstrating that the purpose of jailbreaking is not for pirating content and that the community itself is actively against piracy."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,Raumschiff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, one reason for the importance of rule #1 is that the legal status of jailbreaking is related to whether it's primarily associated with piracy or primarily associated with legitimate original work. This is a factor that the Copyright Office considers when they review the DMCA exemption proposals about jailbreaking devices.  Here's a quote from the 2012 ruling approving the exemption for jailbreaking smartphones, from this document:   Page 15: ""The Register determined that the statutory factors weighed in favor of a renewed exemption for smartphones, as nothing in the record suggested that the market for mobile phones had been negatively impacted by the designation of such a class and, in fact, such a class might make smartphones more attractive to consumers. While Joint Creators raised concerns about pirated applications that are able to run on jailbroken devices, the record did not demonstrate any significant relationship between jailbreaking and piracy.""   Compare this to their denial of the exemption for jailbreaking/rooting game consoles, in the same document:   Page 46: ""Opponents pointed to online forums and other sources that specifically referenced George Hotz‚Äôs hack of the PS3 ‚Äì described sympathetically by EFF in its proposal ‚Äì as permitting users to play pirated games and content, and provided representative postings. The documentation evidenced a broadly shared perception in the gaming community that jailbreaking leads to piracy.""  Pages 50-51: ""Turning to the statutory factors, the Register took issue with proponents‚Äô view that piracy was an irrelevant consideration because the exemption they sought was only to allow interoperability with ‚Äúlawfully obtained applications.‚Äù The Register explained that she could not ignore the record before her. Even if piracy were not the initial or intended purpose for circumvention, the record substantiated opponents‚Äô assessment that in the case of video games, console jailbreaking leads to a higher level of infringing activity, thus sharply distinguishing the case of video consoles from smartphones, where the record did not support the same finding.""

What's worse is a lot of the artists on SoundCloud are in the same position as tweak developers, they're independent artists/developers who love what they do and just want to make a little bit of income from what they do."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,HypoLuxa,7,Tue Jul 21 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"SoundCloud downloaders are a complicated situation that we handle by following the lead of the default repositories.  Music Enhancer was available on a default repository for a short while, although it was withdrawn from the Cydia Store and buyers got refunded. This means that discussion of Music Enhancer was legitimate on this subreddit for a bit, and it wouldn't really make sense to retroactively remove all discussion of it.  UnlimMusic is available on a default repository, and its package page says ""The Application uses SoundCloud API and downloads only the songs which are officially allowed by the artists of SoundCloud and hence respects their terms of use and copyrights policies. This means that not all songs are downloadable but all songs on the app are streamable."" Since it's on a default repository, we allow discussion of it.  That brings up a related issue: SoundCloud having the option for artists to officially allow downloads makes it somewhat weird to preemptively remove all discussion of downloading SoundCloud songs, since it can be legitimate to download SoundCloud songs.  But in general, much like with my comment about us missing posts about Spotify hacks, it's totally possible for us to miss piratey posts about SoundCloud downloaders. If you catch something about SoundCloud that we've missed and should look at, click ""report"" or send us a quick modmail and we'll check it out."

I'm really tired of the high and mighty attitude on this subreddit especially with the bullshit of not sharing a free app because it's cracked and might break copyright. I'd understand if someone was trying to monetize on it, then I'd concede.  If we're just trying to get a tweak to work acting like we're lords of all that's right and wrong seems a little silly. I'm just sharing my opinion.   Edit: after mulling it over I realized that this is actually a problem that's much bigger than just this subreddit. This is a problem with reddit as a whole trying to police itself with what is and is not acceptable content on a platform that thrives on perceived freedom of speech. Really wish we had an alternative to reddit..."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,scotty588,-5,Tue Jul 21 04:50:49 2015 UTC,"This isn't a matter of freedom of speech. The very act of redistributing any content (app, tweak, theme, wallpaper, music, etc) without the knowledge and consent of the creator/owner is illegal, and when someone posts such content (or discusses how to access illegally redistributed content), it then involves the moderators and the subreddit itself in this illegal activity. I don't think nearly as many people would care about this if it didn't actually affect this entire community and the legality of jailbreaking itself. If it was decided that the purpose of jailbreaking was to pirate/redistribute content illegally (because the community allows such illegal activities to go on), then jailbreaking could become illegal (it would not have an exemption to DMCA law, as it does currently).  /u/beetling posted a detailed comment here"

Snapchat decoded to finally enforce its own policies by banning account that use stuff like Phantom.  Now this sub bitches about this. How dare they ban such tools that were created to save images you are not allowed to save.  As soon as it goes about compensation for tweaks this sub acts as the supreme morality enforcer. But saving other peoples images to which you don‚Äôt have the rights to is somehow completely fine because ‚Äúthose nudes are so awesome‚Äù.  Snapchat is completely right in banning those accounts and if that means that jailbreak users have to be excluded for the safety of their users, then this is absolutely the right thing to do. If I were snapchat I weren‚Äôt banning you. I‚Äôd sue the loving shit out of you.  I think this sub‚Äôs double standards need to be erased. If you‚Äôre against piracy then be against it.

Also, I wouldn't really connect piracy and privacy in the very same discussion, those are very different topics. I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve.  (And I'm fairly sure that you don't need any particular rights just to save a image, even moreso that you can't sue someone over a saved picture.)"
jailbreak,3e0wh8,beetling,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:28 2015 UTC,I don‚Äôt use snapchat but couldn‚Äôt you just screenshot it anyways?
jailbreak,3e0wh8,napster-grey,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:04 2015 UTC,In this very special case pirvacy and piracy is in fact the same.  The image owner shares the image thinking they cannot be saved. He still holds the copyright to his images. Not being able to save them is in this case part of the copyright.  By saving them you infringe said copyright in top of the infringement of personal rights.  Why I‚Äôm upset you ask? Because personal rights are important. More important than some douchebags wanting to gap to some needs they saw.   If you value the douchebags more than your rights then you really have a problem.
jailbreak,3e0wh8,Newgunnerr,3,Tue Jul 21 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, copyright doesn't mean you get to decide everything about how your creative work is used. Instead, it gives you a specific set of rights, and they have some exceptions. In this situation, I'm not sure there's a strong case that permanently saving a copy of a Snapchat image would be copyright infringement. The author of the image chose to send you a copy of the image, so the image got to your device in a legal way, and then you're bypassing a software restriction to keep the image that you've been sent. There could be some other kind of law affecting this, but I'm not sure there's copyright infringement happening."
jailbreak,3e0wh8,Newgunnerr,-4,Tue Jul 21 13:27:39 2015 UTC,"I understand, you're taking the term piracy really general, I wouldn't describe what you're speaking about as piracy.   But isn't it kind of stupid to publish pictures to be viewed by everybody but not expecting them to be saved? That's like throwing your money on the street and expecting nobody to take it with him, as it's yours after all.  I'm really unsure about Copyright infringement, personal rights etc, especially as you're already giving up any exclusive rights by agreeing to SnapChats ToS. SnapChat can print out your nudes and display them at the Times Square if they want. I'm even more wary if there's any sort of law infringement present (some sort of source maybe?). We're still dealing about private parties here after all."

Because, literally 1 hour ago I was using snapchat fine, and a minute ago I was going to check it again, and there was this Phantom Login option, and my account was logged out. First, I tried doing the normal log-in method, and my account got locked (unlocking it is very simple, just go to snapchat website), and then I tried using the Phantom logging method using bluetooth, but nothing really happened.  Is the Phantom tweak having some issues? Should we worry about this? This happenned all so fast, I'm really confused."

jailbreak,3e0hlk,patoons,8,Tue Jul 21 01:56:32 2015 UTC,interesting. I'm gonna go out on a limb and speculate someone sent that tweet out that didn't understand that the difference between being jailbroken and being jailbroken and having phantom installed
jailbreak,3e0hlk,nick-sta,2,Tue Jul 21 02:13:41 2015 UTC,"That was exactly that. The person doing snapchat support was tweeting that at everyone that complained and also said to removed the tweak ""cydia"" in some of them."
jailbreak,3e0hlk,Secretss,2,Tue Jul 21 08:56:17 2015 UTC,From what I can understand they sent an ota update that broke jailbreak tweaks some how.
jailbreak,3e0hlk,jovifcp,6,Tue Jul 21 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah. People have reported being locked out with the following tweaks installed:   phantom snapchat log snap master ghostprefs AppPlus   Even one person has said that Eclipse affects it and we should blacklist Snapchat in Eclipse's settings.  Yet another comment mentioned that his friends without phantom or any snapchat tweaks installed were also getting locked out.  There was a tweet that's being linked around (that's probably by Snapchat) that said that snapchat will not work on jailbroken devices, but that tweet has been taken down (hence I can't be sure that it's from Snapchat). People have also commented that the tweet is incorrect because jailbreak masking tweaks and patches still work and all that matters are the tweaks, not the jailbroken status of the device.  Some have said that you don't have to uninstall the tweaks because disabling them is sufficient. Some have said that didn't work and they got locked again a few minutes after unlocking.  What is clear is that this new attack is not tied to actual app updates from the app store, because downgrading to another version does not work reliably or for long. You just get locked out again eventually.   These methods (downgrading/disabling) are working for some people and not for others.   I can see how this can be confusing :( /u/jovifcp  There is a risk that even if cokepokes or someone finds a way to get around this cull, it will just get worse because the next time snapchat works around the developers's/hackers' defences, they could simply ban the accounts instead of just locking them."

jailbreak,3e0ay4,UghNunally,2,Tue Jul 21 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"There's no way you can find the user.plist without opening the downgraded version so here's what you actually do:   First step is to disable any and all Snapchat-entwined tweaks through Icleaner or just uninstall them. Next, download and log in to Snapchat version 9.12. Through Ifile or filza, locate the user.plist file for Snapchat in var/mobile/containers/data/application/(folder) (this may take some time, though I think just searching for user.plist from that menu should work). Copy the user.plist file to a safe place for later use Delete v9.12 and install an earlier IPA (I used Ifunbox to install v9.10 v9.9 - Because 9.10 crashes on ios 8.4 (Well for me anyway)) Once you've installed v9.9, open it, and log on. You should get an error message saying the version is outdated. Good. Now open app switcher and close Snapchat. Make sure it's closed before continuing otherwise you'll have to reinstall and start from step 5. Locate the new snapchat folder in var/mobile/containers/data/application/(folder) and overwrite it with the previously saved user.plist file from version 9.12. Re-enable or re-install phantom/any other Snapchat tweaks (note-I can only confirm phantom works). Open Snapchat again, it should now log on automatically and you'll get to use it normally with Phantom or any Snapchat tweaks installed without being locked out.   Happy Snapping!"

I have a very specific question/request; I was wondering if it was possible for third party keyboards to be auto-launched/kept in background without it being unloaded off the RAM. I ask this because currently Apple's third party keyboard implementation is somewhat buggy, and opening the keyboard when it‚Äôs not loaded in the RAM sometimes takes forever, which is very impractical to say the least.  In case you‚Äôre kind enough to look at this case, here's some technical info that I know of for third party keyboards to maybe help you a bit :   Third party keyboards belong to app extensions, not apps (which I worry might make this harder).  In the jetsam priority plist, the entry that sets the limits to third party keyboards is called 'com.apple.keyboard-service' under 'ExtensionSDKs'.  By default, on an iPhone 5c, the jetsam limit is for them is 40MB, priority of 8 (which is lower than the foreground app) and reaching the memory limit is fatal."

I really appreciate someone is fixing the issue that apple still has not touched on.   I am willing to help on a one on one basis with you.   Some things I would like to help with. Or anything else for that matter.    Escort live. I use the escort live app for my radar detector via Bluetooth. It's like waze but better / paid / active radar detector. This app refreshes in the background then times out after 10 minutes even though gps is still moving.  I order an apple watch do anything that is needed with pushing or receiving commands.  I'd like to work with background OpenSSH and creating a  FTP connection to transfer all my pictures / files. I would like to setup a timer and have this do an automatic pull but now I have to sit with screen on and baby sit.   I use several golf apps and I have a terrible time with them working properly. Refreshing gps and quitting. Love to help out in this sense too.    Anything else that is needed I would love to help.   Thanks mate. I'll send u a private email if interested."

If cydia's dpkg implementation used changelogs it may be possible (if repos implemented it as well) but that is not the case.  Cydia's ""Changes"" tab is able to function because it is possible to figure out what packages have changed since the last time it updated the package list. What this means is that when you first add a repo (like a fresh jailbreak) everything is new and goes to the top of the ""Changes"" tab.  This history is local to your device. Best case scenario is that recently updated or released tweaks and themes could populate the top of the repo list as time goes by."

jailbreak,3e29hr,iautran,3,Tue Jul 21 12:04:06 2015 UTC,virtual daemon tools... mount the img file... open the folders till you find your pics... perhaps?
jailbreak,3e29hr,mossberbb,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"are you running Windows or OS X? On windows things are definately harder. in any case if you have a dd image the first order of business is to mount the image. if your dad image is of just a single partition, you should be able mount it on OS X with a simple loop back mount. if your dad image is of the whole flash chip it is slightly tricker.   Once again on Windows, if you have a single partition image, you could mount it but you would need third party software. Another poster mentioned daemon tools. If that actually does a real loopback mount, then you can use it. It has been way too long since I last used it to know if it is a real mount, or if it exposes the contents as a different file system. You can tell if a tool does a proper loop back mount because windows won't let you browse the drive, because it does not have drivers for the HSFX file system. if you want to actually browse the drive you need to find and install drivers for that file system. I have no idea if such drivers currently exist.  In any case if the photos were already deleted at the time you made the image, you will need to run undefeated software that supports HFSX. I imagine such software is readily available on OS X but I'm not sure if any such software currently exists on Windows."

jailbreak,3e29hr,teezythakidd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm unfamiliar with this ""dd"" command. From what I'm getting, though, the command made an archive of your device and saved it in an .IMG file.  Since Windows 7, mounting disk images (.ISO,.IMG,.UDF, etc.) is a built-in feature. If it won't mount, you can try to open it with a file extractor, preferably 7-Zip. It's free, open-source, and super awesome. I've been using it for years! It opens all types of archives.   If you have a Mac, mounting disk images is also a built-in feature and has been for many iterations of Mac OS/OSX. If the file doesn't mount, your archive may be corrupted.  I don't depend on dumps to retrieve media, I've recently been using Photos (used-to-be iPhoto) to back up my photos and videos. I keep that library on an external drive, since I take a lot of both and run up storage on my phone relatively quickly lol. iTunes backups are also always gold mines when it comes to retrieving that media if you use a proper app to do so (my preference is iExplorer; works like a charm).  Either which way, good luck!"

So if you don't need your reported battery % be fully accurate you shouldn't need to calibrate it often.

If you find yourself running out completely, implementing some or all of the above tips or a partial charge mid day can help extend the life of your battery.

jailbreak,3dy1i6,mikkel-petersen,3,Mon Jul 20 14:47:36 2015 UTC,I think this is probably more for when your battery is low. You could make a bunch of toggles (of use an existing tweak) that disables all these at once when your battery is low.

I though there was something going on with a tweak until I figured out it was PARALLAX causing the spike. My backboardd never goes about 9% now, and is hovering at about 3 unless I'm actually sliding. Even then it's about half of the cpu usage. It also recovers much quicker.

To be clear, NoMotion installed AND Reduce motion on is the best combination to save battery / resources. NoMotion doesn't actually bring the animations back, it's only function is to disable parallax systemwide & has no effect on animations. It does it's job more thoroughly than the stock iOS Reduce motion option does. Reduce motion leaves the parallax effect in apps, but NoMotion gets rid of it everywhere. May or may not make a huge difference, I honestly don't know. Even if it helps a little, it's well worth the price (free)"

Get TetherStatus to change the pulsing status bar into a status bar icon. Any pulsing secondary status bar will take some juice including those from cydia tweaks.  Cell signal strength also impacts battery level. The weaker the signal, the more power the phone will use to establish a handshake with the nearest tower. And it has to establish this with a tower very frequently, so every desperate search for a signal costs you battery life. If you're at some place with weak signals, turn on Airplane mode if you can.  Turn on Auto Lock and set it to a smaller duration, (obviously).  Under Location services -> System services, if you want Reminders to make use of geofencing to give you alerts, you have to leave Location-Based Alerts and Motion Calibration & Distance on."

If I switch it to Manual, are my changes made on OS X not going to be pushed to the phone, and I would have to manually request for the changes by opening the app? That may be troublesome when I leave a Wifi zone to go outdoors, because this would depend on me remembering to manually request the update on my phone before I leave.

It'll calculate how many shallow charges constitute one whole charge cycle (Of which an iPhone battery supports up to 1000). Sometimes, the calculations can become off, so doing an occasional full cycle (Personally, I think once every six months is fine but this is subjective opinion) will allow the software to accurately reflect the battery health.

Everything was working on the previous version of lockglyph, but there was a change to the naming scheme on the new version and that's when the issue started. It may be a bug with the new version of lockglyph. The dev just finished with the asphelia update (I think), so hopefully he'll be able to take a look at it. If any new info comes up, I'll update my packages to fix/support it.   Thanks for letting me know!!

The most simple way to explain it is ""Free memory is wasted memory"" - iOS will leave apps/etc loaded into memory until it needs more memory for something else, then it unloads and replaces the necessary memory space.   Moral of the story: Don't stress too much about RAM, iOS makes very efficient use of it already. Here is an article that explains some more about multitasking and RAM in iOS.  That said, I've had issues with certain tweaks causing my phone to run fine for a while (2-3 hours) then suddenly get extremely slow and laggy. This can be due to a memory leak, but full or nearly full RAM alone is not enough to diagnose a memory leak. In your case, the freezing does seem to indicate a buggy tweak, and /u/Car5V already pointed out a couple likely suspects."

jailbreak,3dzf3n,saurik,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:04 2015 UTC,"The primary goals of this feature are to allow for 1) a repository to ""pull"" a package by reverting to an old copy and allow the user a interface to downgrade to that older copy, 2) to deal with cases where a user has a ""beta repository"" installed that has a newer version of a package that is ""stable"" that they would like to install, and finally 3) to allow repositories to temporarily (only temporarily!!!) provide an easy way to get an old version of a package when they push new potentially broken updates. I will be using this feature for most of my packages, and will be leaving the downgrades in my repository for 1-2 days after, until the new version has been vetted. The package catalogs are already very large: they should not be bloated with the full history of every package; and it is very often the case that the upgrades most likely to cause issues are the ones that are most important: if you downgrade to a version of Cydia older than just few versions back (to one released mere weeks ago) Cydia will not open... this is not something that should be made easy by the UI (especially as the safety provided by features like Breaks, Depends, and Conflicts, by definition cannot be retroactive), given how trivial it is to do with Safari and iFile.

Watchdog covers all use cases:  1] For perpetual connectivity of apps that DO have backgrounding capability (Smartwatch+, Whatsapp)   OFF Keep in Foreground ON Auto Launch ON Prevent Termination   Notifications still work when backgrounded, at least for Whatsapp, they do.  2] For perpetual connectivity of apps that DON'T have backgrounding capability (Instashare)   ON Keep in Foreground ON Auto Launch ON Prevent Termination   3] For InfinityTask equivalency without the ‚Äúperpetual‚Äù aspect, only when they are launched and in use; effect stops when apps are quit from app switcher   ON Enable backgrounding OFF Keep in Foreground OFF Auto Launch OFF Prevent Termination   Keep in Foreground is OFF because InfinityTask doesn't help apps with no backgrounding capability, which means the only apps that can benefit from InfinityTask are ones that can already run in background without needing to be forced to run in pseudo foreground. Therefore to more accurately emulate InfinityTask, Keep in Foreground is set to OFF because it doesn't need to be on. (If you want the use case of InfinityTask+perpetuality, look at use case 1)  4] For extended running of apps that DON'T have backgrounding capability, without the ""perpetual"" aspect, only when they are launched and in use; effect stops when apps are quit from app switcher (iCleaner, some banking apps)   ON Keep in Foreground OFF Auto Launch OFF Prevent Termination   5] For extended backgrounding/foregrounding of apps on-the-fly as needed   By using the app switcher app icon toggle (yes this works with gridswitcher) Using this toggle switches on the ‚ÄúEnable backgrounding‚Äù switch in each app, which is a main switch governing the other 3 switches below it. The configuration of the 3 switches are sustained when using the app switcher toggle, meaning that the app switcher toggle doesn't override how the 3 switches are set up.   It works well, and my battery life is still fair, with 1 foregrounded app and 3 backgrounded apps: http://imgur.com/a/JAic5#3 (6 days without Watchdog, 2 days with Watchdog).  However, for better battery life I've asked the dev to include a DND switch, like this: http://i.imgur.com/URFAmIr.png http://i.imgur.com/tUGXBLr.png And hopefully he is willing to add it."

Will it:   Extend backgrounding (i.e. only for apps with native backgrounding capability) (this is what infinitytask does) Force pseudo foregrounding (i.e. all apps will benefit equally) Selectively extend backgrounding/force foregrounding depending on whether the app has native backgrounding capability or not (i.e. all apps will benefit differently) (this is what watchdog does)   ?  Further, if what I understand is correct, after a respring or reboot, BB8 will auto launch (and subsequently take effect on) the whitelisted apps but only if they were previously loaded in the app switcher, is this correct? This is talking about BB8's final form when a whitelist is implemented.   Lastly, BB8 does prevents iOS app termination (which otherwise kicks in after 10 min of native backgrounding), but respects user termination (i.e. it stops taking effect when user quits the app from app switcher), is this correct?  Thanks in advance for answering."
jailbreak,3dvuw2,Rdy2Lose,3,Mon Jul 20 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"The second one is what i'm trying to achieve. No autolaunch, and it does prevent auto termination you can terminate the app manually by swiping up in the switcher as usual."

Not everybody who asks about that is trying to steal a phone, however it's impossible to know the difference between someone who genuinely needs to be able to bypass a passcode for a legit reason and someone who just made up a story so that they don't have to expose what they truly want to do (again, I'm not saying that's what you are doing).

jailbreak,3dw2ao,Elprede007,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"This a GREAT tweak - beta working as expected on my 5S 8.1.2.  I second the idea of being able to configure a delay timer, and it would be great if the notification could be set to recur and/or persist in the Notification Center.  Would also be useful to get a notification on the lock screen in the case where you lock the device from the messages app without the message being sent (I often forget to hit send or miss the send button, then lock the device)  Finally - maybe this (and the user options mentioned above) could be a paid ""pro"" version option - can the warnings appear on other devices connected to the same account?  Here is my use-case example:  I am messaging from my iPad, and I type a message, hit ""send"", slam the iPad case closed and walk away from it with my iPhone I'm my pocket.  But I actually missed the ""send"" button - in my haste I hit next to the send button and didn't watch to see if the message left (this is compounded because I use the ""SendDelay"" tweak so that for 2 seconds after I hit ""send"" the message doesn't go anywhere). I then don't get a reply on my phone, and either assume the sender has received what I sent and acted on it or I get frustrated when I don't get the expected reply.  I then come back to my iPad hours later to see the message sitting there unsent.  D'oh!  If you can write the tweak so that my iPhone warns me that I have an unsent message sitting on my iPad after a couple of minutes, I would be grateful and open my wallet!"

So that when you install a tweak you had before, it will already be configured the way it was on 8.3. Here is how you update to 8.4:   Connect your device to your computer and open itunes. Then make an iTunes backup. This will back up your apps, music, videos, tweak settings, etc. If you want to back up your tweaks, download a tweak called AppInfo. It will make a list of all your tweaks that you can then email to yourself. You can then use that list as reference when you reinstall each tweak manually. Once that is done, restore your device. To do this, click on ""Restore iPhone"" in iTunes. This will wipe your device and update you to 8.4. Now set it up as a new device and then once you reach the homescreen, you cn use TaiG to jailbreak it. Now you can open iTunes on your computer again and restore your backup. To do this, click on ""Restore Backup"".   That's it! Now you are on 8.4 and jailbroken. If you have any questions, let me know. :)"

jailbreak,3dxksl,HyperCamel,5,Mon Jul 20 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"If you could do the following, you wont really need any tweaks, unless you need to keep switching on and off any of these features.     Turn of auto brightness Turn off background app refresh Turn stock mail to manual fetch and use CloudMagic app for email. Consumes very less battery power and performs excellently. Leave these on Use NoBlur andd HideMe8. Gives a break to your iPhone CPU. Excluding end of the day, stop killing apps from the background. Especially the ones that doesn't have any background activity happening. Turn off vibration if you dont need it. Install Locus tweak to have better control on location services, Turn push notifications on only for the apps you really need. Regarding 3G and Wifi, use Activator to its best to enable and disable them as per your need. Skip aesthetically enhancing tweaks. Keep a balance between the tweaks you need and want. i personally use the productive ones like Tage and a few others. If you would like, use Speed Intensifier in advanced mode at speed level  5 or 6. Its speeds up animations system wide, even withjn apps, which means it will get tasks done faster, and that equals more productivity and less on screen time. Turn on Reduce Motion and install NoMotion. Not necessary, but if you cant keep your eyes off the battery icon, might as well let it show you the Actuall Battery power left. Install it, otherwise just skip this step and turn off battery percentage.   Also for a healthy battery, charge it fully to 100% and half an hour more (which is when its actually fully charged, without the Actually battery tweak). Let it drain then completely and turn your iphone off. Then charge it again fully. This recalibrates your battery percentage accuracy. Advisable to not heavily use your iphone while its charging the second time. You can also reset network settings. I personally did it yeaterday and noticed that it also eliminated any slight lag I noticed within apps. Power off your phone once in a while. Let it get a break for a few mins...this depends on the users psychological relief if any, i do it once it a while and mentally experience a refreshed and fluid operation of iOS.

My only real complaint is that you can't really use other lock screen tweaks. I used forecast at one point with it, but Locus doesn't agree with it so that had to go. While the initial cost is a bit steep, I find it well worth it.   Also, if you buy now, they usually give people who purchased the app between release date and 6 months back a free upgrade, so you'll be set for iOS9 whenever that build is released.

This went two or three times until I realized it was useless. Deleted the app and didn't look back.  There are devs who make tweaks for free that give better support. For $10, this product and support should be exemplary. My biggest complaints, other than poor communication, is that the tweak is specifically said to support versions of the iOS that it does ‚Ä¢not‚Ä¢ support, at least not without jumping through complicated hoops (and then doesn't work reliably). Also, his assertion that ""It's so simple a caveman can do it"" is insulting, and untrue. I'm pretty darn capable, and what purports to be a tap-and-go backup program is anything but.

Or rather, not without a lot of hoop-jumping, winding up with a setup that is still problematic to say the least.   Example:    Update to the newest version (months ago), only to find it crashes to springboard. Write developer with the report. No answer. Days later, write developer with the report and request a response. None. Days later write again, asking to PLEASE write back with an an explanation or fix. No answer. Write, again, ‚Ä¢begging‚Ä¢ the dev to explain. Dev writes back with instructions to install a special repo and download a ""fixed version"" saying, ""Let me know."" (Exact quote) Install the repo, which is empty. Write developer to ask where the file is. No answer. Write back a few days later to ask about the file again. No answer. Write back again, explaining the whole problem with crashing, no file in the repo and frustration about not getting any help. No answer. Two weeks later, get a response explaining to delete the app, go into iFile, delete a pref file, respring, install the fixed one from the repo (which miraculously now has a file), respring, reboot and finally‚Ä¶ ""Let me know."" Follow his directions to the letter, which installs an older ""fixed"" version for iOS 6, but which has a version number that doesn't correspond to anything on his Change Log page. However, upon every launch the app puts up a non-dismissible dialog explaining that the app is out of date, and needs to be updated in Cydia. Can't dismiss, can't decline, only update. Press ""Update"" which opens Cydia, update the app, and guess what‚Ä¶ it crashes because‚Ä¶ it's the newest version. Mobius strip! Write the developer no less than three times over a week or so to explain about the update message put up by PkgBackup, and the endless loop‚Ä¶ but no response! Uninstall PkgBackup from the iPhone and Mini, and kiss off the $10 bucks and ability to ""keep it simple."" It's still installed on my iPad Air 2, but I have no confidence whatsoever.

I've owned since ios6 and you're way better off using appinfo  backup your tweak list and sources. Using pkgbackup always fails to restore something that isn't updated or compatible with the new iOS when you upgrade and try to restore from an older iOS backup. I've never tried to restore on the same iOS as the backup is. This may work flawlessly. I don't know.
jailbreak,3dy7e0,mredofcourse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'm using it sonce iOS4, it always worked like a charm. I only had one problem back in the days, but it was quickly solved.

Once you have set it up like you want it (I only backup repos, tweaks and their settings, no apps), it's just starting the app, hit backup and wait.

Another way to put this is that you are trying to optimize something blindly for something almost no one does, and which would probably drastically decrease conversion rates for the 99% case of ""I want to buy one product, because that is why I installed Cydia in the first place"", and that horribly skews this attempt to somehow viscerally prove something with tons of bullets."

We can't merge ""Pay $X"" with ""Don't Add to Shopping Cart"" due to the intervening ""Login"" step. While I've actually totally considered having a feature similar to a shopping cart in Cydia, it would be for installations, not for purchases: I still do not see any arguments for why shopping carts would be beneficial... at best they maintain the status quo, and that's if you avoid making things longer and more confusing, which doesn't seem possible (like, the only way to do it so far seems to be to try to consolidate steps by adding many more buttons and choices to make, which is a bad thing even if the number of clicks is the same).

jailbreak,3dw03a,X-weApon-X,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:17 2015 UTC,You would need GIFPaper for that and VWallpaper for video files (though I haven't used vWallpaper in years - and I think it drains more battery that GIFPaper).

Do you know anyone from whom you can get a more stock copy of rtadvd?"
jailbreak,3dxuur,ReddestDream,2,Mon Jul 20 14:32:48 2015 UTC,"Is this possibly related to the random amfid crashes I get sometimes when enabling Personal Hotspot (Native Tethering)?  I've always had network-cmds installed, and I never realized that it overrode an important file with a different (possibly older) version.  Edit: I'm working on borrowing another device to jailbreak so I can retrieve a stock copy of rtadvd.  Edit 2: So, I got a copy of the original rtadvd and replaced the one that came with network-cmds. amfid still crashes though . . . :/  Despite this, the rtadvd provided by network-cmds is much older (2009) and not 64-bit, while the one that came with iOS 8.4 (June 2015) is . . ."

The main question would be if Apple added some iOS-specific hacks to it that they now rely on or something. Regardless, your issues don't seem to have been fixed by replacing the correct version of the file. And finally, I only noticed this a couple days ago: I will try to do something about it, somehow. What I really want, FWIW, is for the stock system files to be considered installed bt a base package by the jailbreak, which was actually the original goal of the virtual firmware package, so it would be impossible for any package to randomly overwrite them, but that requires a ton of coordination with jailbreak teams, and in addition to that already being hard to make happen, with jailbreaks usually being coordinated with me only after-the-fact, what few negotiating chips I have to convince jailbreak teams to listen to me are being actively attacked by the people who hate me, so it is likely to just get harder in the near future :/.)"

It won't get better anytime soon, I've called the support service for about a year just to hear that my tower was in maintenance.  In this ""maintenance period"", I had absolutely no data in most parts of my town (over 100k population).   This may not be a direct fix for you, but I really do not want any more people on this earth to go through another 2 year contract with sprint.   My family paid the early termination fee, and switched over to Verizon.   Everyone around me would be using their phone. While I sit there knowing it will not work. As soon as I got Verizon, it's 25x faster (I tested it)  It's the honest truth, and I'm sorry if you aren't in a place where you can early terminate, but this is my personal experience."
jailbreak,3dwq0a,iamandrewj,0,Mon Jul 20 04:37:30 2015 UTC,Yes you can set your primary bands 41 as first and band 25 800mhz as second and the slow band 26 1900 as last. Only if you receive band 41 strong that it will help.   Also not to be negative as the guy on top @iamandrewj. Sprint is improving with carrier aggregation and they are getting speeds in the 90mpbs with newer phones or current phones that support ca (carrier aggregation). Be sure to look out for that.
jailbreak,3dwq0a,9to5Slavery,2,Mon Jul 20 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"Even last year they said that it would be fixed that weekend. I would call again, and they said repair is next week. Just a continuous cycle. While we were paying for a plan that we had no data from.   The guy said ""well we see a lot of data activity on your account"". Well obviously, as we are always trying to connect and refresh the page!  In the north sprint is very strong. I know this because almost every single northern person I know has sprint with the unlimited data.   It's great because it's unlimited and it's fast. But the bad part to that story is past Virginia their service goes BOOM. It's like they have a barrier set and no data can reach North Carolina.

I live near a Spark enabled tower and get 30-40 mgs sometimes even 60. I've seen my phone go up to 120 rarely. I'm on unlimited data no throttling either. Grandfather plan.

Stay on edge if your device is just in your pocket, and only switch to 3g/lte when you are actively using it.  Also disable location services unless you really need them.  Be sure to keep your screen on <50% brightness, unless you need it to be brighter due to the sun.

Edit: also worth noting that it won't respring at all if you disable both the ""cache files"" and ""temporary files"" steps, as it doesn't really need to do that in that case, since there are no files being deleted by the other steps that need to be regenerated by initiating a respring."

In BioProtect, you can set trusted wifi networks that will unlock all protected apps. Whereas in biolockdown you can set it to individual app..that's the only feature missing in BioProtect afaik.

The way I clone apps is like this and it's all done on the device:   In iFile or Filza (preferably Filza since it can install IPA's), find the app you want to clone in var/mobile/Containers/Bundle/Application and copy its (AppName).app folder.  Create a Payload folder and paste the .app folder within it.  Open the info.plist with the property list viewer and change the CFBundleIdentifier and CFBundleDisplayName. Zip the payload folder, then change its extension to .ipa Install with Filza, IPA Installer or AppCake.    This has always worked for me. I've never had to mess with the metadata plist."

Does your ipod work fine? If yes stay. Are there tiny issues? Do you have the spare time to put evreything back to the way it was? If these tiny issues are bearable, stay.  8.4 will have some small bug fixes and tiny, tiny performance improvements (nothing you can't get with an animation speed tweak) so really there's no reason to upgrade, unless you're having decent problems in which case upgrade and jb asap.

jailbreak,3dtde0,Jamjijangjong,2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:06 2015 UTC,You're not understanding the situation. This isn't ads that are loaded from some other source that an ad blocker can block. These are ads built into the tweak that advertise the dev's other tweaks. They're banners that appear periodically. They can't be blocked because they're not being loaded externally. They're part of the tweak itself.
jailbreak,3dtde0,iamjamieq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:58:56 2015 UTC,Request a tweak to block/remove the ads of Facebook++/Instagram++?  That's the best thing I can think of of you paid for no ads and you get ads after emailing the dev with no response.

I'm not the developer, but have seen these before as well as his comments on it and I believe I can set this strait.   By default, most of the ""++"" tweaks display ads from and ad network (google, I think) before you purchase the upgrade. Most of the time, these are for completely generic things like you would see in an ad banner on google. They display at the bottom of the screen.  There is another type of ""ad"" which is a lot less common and a lot more elegant from the developers of the tweak themselves, NOT an ad network. It lets you know about their other ""++"" tweaks. This banner is only supposed to show 3 times if you have purchased the in app upgrade."

jailbreak,3dtde0,alexnoyle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"The issue here, is clarification. You are paying for the removal of the ads from the ad network, not the removal of the ads from the developer about their other tweaks.

They updated the public version to support the latest iOS like the on the beta repo. But this one didn't have an option to remove ads. In fact there were no ads at all.

jailbreak,3dsp9b,angelXwind,23,Sun Jul 19 02:14:11 2015 UTC,"For anyone who is curious about the history of a certain bug in AppSync Unified:  Back when iOS 8 was released, AppSync Unified was the cause of a rather peculiar bug ‚Äî a bug where running uicache would cause installd to crash. This lead to many users experiencing an issue where apps they installed from Cydia would never appear on SpringBoard ‚Äî because uicache never got far enough without crashing and dying.  I wrote a fix for that, by checking a value I'll refer from here on as super->count ‚Äî where super refers to SuperBlob.  The issue was that installd was running into an infinite loop (and therefore crashing) while processing entitlement data during ASU's  copyEntitlementDataFromFile function. To fix this, I added a condition that evaluates if ((super->count) > -1). However, I managed to forget that super->count returns an uint32_t, where -1 is actually INT_MAX. This was fine on iOS 8.2 and below, because super->count always returned a value that was greater than INT_MAX, so the condition would evaluate to 1 and entitlement data would copy. Any super->count value that would cause the infinite loop failed the conditional, so the infinite loop bug appeared to be ""fixed"" ‚Äî for all iOS versions from 8.0 to 8.2.  Now, iOS 8.3 changed something that caused super->count to start returning values that did not exceed INT_MAX ‚Äî so the condition I previously wrote would fail every time, and entitlement data would never get copied on iOS 8.3/8.4 for fakesigned apps that pass through the copyEntitlementDataFromFile function in ASU.  When TaiG released the iOS 8.3 untether, I was days away from leaving for Japan, and I didn't have time to investigate the bug thoroughly (in hindsight, it would have only taken literal seconds to fix had I known the mistake I made earlier <_>). So I wrote up a quick and really dirty ""fix"" which involved just checking for iOS 8.3's kCFCoreFoundationVersionNumber and short-circuiting the conditional to always copy entitlement data regardless of super->count's value ‚Äî which led to the resurrecting of the installd infinite loop bug for iOS 8.3/8.4 users.  So yes, it fixes the issue where people using iOS 8.3/8.4 sometimes wouldn't see apps installed from Cydia. (because uicache crashes)."

jailbreak,3dsp9b,shatonyourface,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:14 2015 UTC,The issue you're facing has to do with iTunes. iTunes in their recent versions have patched the bug that allowed cracked IPAs to be synced to the device. From my current experience no cracked IPAs can anymore be synced via iTunes. In order to install them you'd need to upload them to a folder in your jailbroken device via SSH/WIFI and then install them either using NewTerm (The Terminal Console for iDevice) or using the familiar GUI of IPA Installer.

A lot of tweaks don't actually require a full respring but the developers just make it mandatory to have a 'clean start'.   I believe anything that hooks into and modifies SpringBoard will require a respring to actually work. This is because when you are modifying or adding methods that exist in SpringBoard, you need to restart the SpringBoard process for this new code to run.  Apps don't require a respring to work since they are standalone (just like apps from the app store) and have all the files needed to run them within the .ipa.   There isn't really a solution to this since it's not really a problem. You can install the new Cydia tweak DismissProgress (by PoomSmart) which adds a ""close"" button at the top right of the installation screen (so you don't have to respring) but keep in mind some tweaks won't function properly until you do a proper respring."

jailbreak,3dxg1i,iamjamieq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:26:02 2015 UTC,Okay no you're getting confused.   Only apps use .ipa so only an app which can be run standalone does not need a respring because it does not modify iOS code.   A tweak modifies iOS code therefore the process it is modifying needs to be restarted before this modification can take effect.  You cannot make a tweak work that modifies springboard without restarting springboard first.

If yes, then this is some sort of a safety feature so that your phone has enough power to boot and not shutdown in the middle of booting. One workaround that I can think of is that setup an activator action to shutdown your phone when it reaches 5%. That way, it has enough power to boot it back. Obviously you should plug it in after it shuts down. Otherwise, it‚Äôs useless because it will just shutdown again after a  few minutes and that time, it will take longer to start up because you have to wait gor it to charge."

I've had personal issues with Protean draining my battery, and I've heard from many that Alkaline and Eclipse 2 are also drainers.   So i would start off with letting your device completely run out of battery and then charging it all the way - close all running apps - then get iCleanerPro and disable each individual tweak and start using your device as you normally would. Repeat the process til you find the tweak.   If that doesn't help, just restore and re-jailbreak without restoring your backup and start fresh.

When I had this happening with my device, I had just installed iCleaner and the problem persisted until I turned off flipswitch support. You should reinstall iCleaner and rather than just deleting it again, turn off flipswitch support and see if that deals with the problem.  You should be able to get the springboard to look normal by respringing until it becomes normal, it used to take me three or four respring's to get it to kick in right. But even with the image shoved up into the corner like that I could still get into iCleaner and turn off flipswitch support.  (edit) I am re-enabling flipswitch support for iCleaner to see if it starts doing this again- nope, whatever bug that is in iCleaner that caused this seems to be totally squashed. I just resprung twice and it's normal.  I need to ask you is the area where the lock screen or springboard is not showing, is that area flashing, flickering brightly? You should see the Apple image of your boot screen in that area, Black or bright white depending on the color of your device. If you are not seeing that in that area, then this is a whole other issue not related to iCleaner, and I would suggest reinstalling iCleaner so you can turn off tweaks and see which tweak causes this new issue."

Perhaps the tweak should scan RSI of known networks, compare and select Network with highest RSI.   I'm only wondering jf continuously scanning of RSI would  not kill battery.

As for blocking ads, using the host file is by far the best method. You just have to find a good list. Some suggest Minimal Hosts 6.2 by Reddest Dream. If you're under 18, that's probably a great choice. If you're not, I suggest Untrusted Hosts Blocker by Thireus. The updates are not as frequent as Dream's but it blocks more ads that I experience. If you're really feeling frisky, you could find a good list on the Internet and paste it in your hosts file.  One add-on worth getting is Hosts Flipswitch to make turning the file on and off super easy. This is necessary because some sites/apps are coded in such a way that ads load linearly with content. Which means that if the ad fails to load, the page fails to load. In that case, you HAVE to load the ads. No existing options or methods.  [Edit] Downvote means something is not relevant or helpful. It's not an opinion button."

I can speak with authority here because I modified my bundle without the crack, lost everything cellular, got the crack, everything worked except in safe mode. That wasn't a viable option, so I found the link to where Apple hosts the bundles, downloaded mine for ATT and I've had no issues since."

I just only said if he has deleted carrier bundles which locate on /var/mobile/Library/Carrier Bundles/, then he does not have to do anything else because the system would get carrier bundle from /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/ instead, which is a default location of carrier bundles.  You do not need to find any download link for official carrier bundle because all of them have already stored on /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/  If you install a custom carrier bundle, it will not store at /System/Library/Carrier Bundles/, but it will store at /var/mobile/Library/Carrier Bundles/ instead. Therefore, if you do something wrong or want to revert carrier bundle to stock, you just delete carrier bundles from /var/mobile/Library/Carrier Bundles/ and perform a reboot, then, done."

In the meantime if you'd like to try using the tweak without activator (not sure if it would work without), you can follow this tutorial to remove the libactivator dependency in andrios. Install it first along with activator, then follow the steps to find the paragraph for andrios, and remove libactivator from the depends line. Then uninstall activator. This will trigger an update flag for andrios though, and if you update you'll get the activator dependency back again.

I never had the chance to test this on iOS 7.  I get the crash when the iDevice attempts to auto-reconnect to a Wifi network whose password has changed.  For some reason, the password popup does not appear and this results in Springboard crashing.  There may also be a conflict with NoAnnoyance influencing this crash, although the author put out an update to it purporting to fix the issue.  When I originally had the crash, both NoAnnoyance and BetterWifi7 were implicated.  I emailed both authors. The author of NoAnnoyance took the blame and fixed it.  The crash still occurred later even after the author of NoAnnoyance fixed it, so I presumed that BetterWifi7 was also still independently causing this crash.  I might be wrong about that and NoAnnoyance may still be causing the issue . . .  I emailed both authors again and did not get a response from either of them.

I think these changes would benefit us all.  From: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/3di3j7/request_personal_grievance_request_to_the/   The first thing is: One thing cleverpin is or was able to do in the past is even when a device is on the lockscreen it wasn't truly locked if cleverpin is activated.   This allowed things that normally wouldn't show like disabled toggles and disabled notification center to be utilized where they otherwise wouldn't be able to be.  Second: Bluetooth and multi mac connect support. In SafeHouse Pro you have the ability to not only select WiFi access points as ""keys"" but also bluetooth devices as well.

Log into your iCloud account in the settings app and switch on contacts only in this list: http://imgur.com/guYJWxJ  Then on a computer log in at iCloud.com and check that your contacts are all synced up.   Then you can restore and update to iOS 8.4, and when it's done, log into your iCloud account when prompted at the set up and turn on contacts. Your iCloud contacts will be synced to the phone.  You don't even need to do a backup and restore, and you can set up your phone as a new device, and still get your iCloud stuff back. iCloud stuff (the ones on the list in the screenshot above) are separate from iCloud backup.  iCloud doesn't support this for messages though. That has to be in a backup and restored. However, you can use a third party program like iBackupBot to extract the messages data from a local backup (not an iCloud backup), then make a backup of a clean restore, then inject the messages data into the clean backup, and finally restore that modified clean backup.

jailbreak,3dsxxq,Car5V,-6,Sun Jul 19 16:22:49 2015 UTC,No because most apps already use javascript and are as fast as they can be. Nitrous won't speed many apps up on iOS 8.4.
jailbreak,3dsxxq,simplycass,6,Sun Jul 19 03:49:05 2015 UTC,I thought the devs had to ditch iOS 7.x support entirely to use the faster JS engine?  There might still be a use for it.

Apps using the old webview would benefit from nitrous. Nitrous allows Apple WebKit JavaScript rendering on old webviews (where it wasn't allowed). Nitrous does not allow apps to used JavaScript
jailbreak,3dsxxq,cryptic_logic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:03:32 2015 UTC,Oh okay then thanks for the correction. I still don't see much difference when using nitrous on most apps that I downloaded on iOS 8. There was more of a difference on iOS 6 and even 7.

I was once even able to make it so that iMessages from 2 different email addresses and text messages started coming in three separate threads even though they were under the same contact!  Until I have time to properly figure out how to stop that happening, starting a new thread and choosing your contacts mobile number (rather than iCloud email) when searching for them should get it to work again."

Hopefully this is the right place to ask but; I'm debating on whether or not I should jailbreak my phone - I kind of want to do it to change my icons to make it look more aesthetically pleasing. I've read up that any security that the iphone came with is gone once jailbroken, but only because these apps may be malware. If I do not install unauthorized apps, is there still the risk of malware?  Also; if I ever want to ""un jailbreak"" my phone and I restore it, does the security come back too?"
jailbreak,3dpzp3,Deelighted,3,Sat Jul 18 23:26:29 2015 UTC,"I see this question a lot and it's not a bad thing. You've paid good money for your phone and it's justified why you'd want to be informed. First, let me say what I've seen in the past by another redditor: ""If you're happy with your phone, you don't have to jailbreak it.""   Jailbreaking does not necessarily open your device up to attacks. Installing random tweaks from 3rd party sources can. The default sources that come with your devices are all inspected for malicious code before even being available to you. Otherwise, almost any malware that will affect your device will affect all others, even if they aren't jailbroken.  What does happen when you jailbreak, however is your warranty for your device is voided. In most cases, restoring the device will remove any signs that you've jailbroken your device, essentially giving you back your warranty. Restoring your phone in iTunes is the same as starting fresh and removing any jailbreak information.  I hope this helps and I was accurate. :)"

Is there any way to get it touch with r_plus? I have a couple of suggestions for Sleipnizer which would make its organization better but emailing him didn‚Äôt help :(. Does anyone know how I can get in touch with pNre? He made Automa, and I wanted to ask him whether he could make a flipswitch toggle for Automa. It‚Äôs one of the tweaks that would be the most useful with a flipswitch toggle but hasn‚Äôt come with one. Is anyone in touch with him? I tried Twitter but he isn‚Äôt active on Twitter and I tried emailing him but from what I (and a few other people experienced), he doesn‚Äôt reply to his emails.

I‚Äôll try again, but I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll respond. Does anyone know how to get rid of the safe mode which pops up every single time you go into safe mode? I don't want to see that pop up again because it's usually pretty annoying. I know how safe mode works now. Alternatively, does anyone know the file that I can edit in order to edit what it says in the safe mode pop up? I think that would be a pretty funny/cool thing to do for myself. Is there a way to automatically hide the calendar when you have no events? I really don't need it saying ""No Events"" when I don't have any events. I just don't even want to see it there. Is there a way to see the full schedule for the current day in the calendar widget in the notification Center? I usually put in my schedule there and it's much easier to see an overview of the whole day instead of the next three or four events/classes that you have. Would anyone be willing to make a flipswitch for the ""Allow Full Access"" keyboard option in the settings app for NinType? I find that I have to toggle that more than 10 times a day in order to get NinType to refresh so that it pops up and I can use it again. This is all Apple's fault, and it'd be really nice to have a flipswitch to be able to fix it. Is there anything like a flipswitch notifier that is available? I would use Protean but it only shows if you flip switches are enabled/disabled. I would just like a pop-up or something like that telling me that the flipswitch has been enabled/disabled. It isn't that important, but I just like to know whether there is something like this. Non-jailbreak related Is there a way to get dictation to use custom words? I've been trying to find out forever but haven't been able to do it. The only way I can think of is to make contacts with the custom words that I want, but that seems like a really crude way to do it as you would have to have a contact with a name that is possibly hundreds of words long.

I have a bunch of patches yet to post but I've been so busy this week that I haven't been able to describe/post them all yet.    Actually, I've been doing some tests with my recent patches... I added a donation address, a mini date (like this ""‚Çá‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚Çà‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ"") and some prefixes.  At first, I was just going to add the date to my updated patches but I think I'll add it to all my patches from now on & then I'll also put something next to it like a little flag ""‚öë"" or maybe a symbol like this ""¬∞"" to indicate if it's been updated.    I'm also testing adding a prefix to specific types of patches in the SpringBoard/System Wide sections like ""NC ‚Ä¢"" for Notification Center or ""SW ‚Ä¢"" for switcher etc.  I've also tested adding a prefix in regular apps (i.e. ""Dialer ‚Äî"") but that one seems to look more cluttered than I anticipated so I'm probably just going to stick with the dot.

If it was going to it would either randomly disconnect (wiggle cord when plugged in to test) or won't work at all. Both are easy to check before restoring or jailbreaking.  Source: I've been using those >$1 Chinese lightning cables for ages. If those work fine, this obviously higher quality one will as well.  Edit: It's also pretty rare but it might cause interference when the device when plugged in and charging. This usually only happens when plugged into a wall plug due to the higher power output vs a USB port on your computer and is caused by improper shielding on the cable, bad wall charger, or both. Symptoms include phantom touches to the screen, or other oddities. I seriously doubt this will happen at all when plugged into your computer though. (Unless you have AI charger installed to boost power output.)  TL;Dr It'll be fine for restores, jailbreaking.

They're gearing up for the RTM and at this point the OS is pretty stable and won't require any new testers. That and MS really wants current testers to use the in place upgrade (update whole OS through Windows Update) to help find any bugs as this is how most people will be installing W10 for the first year. Easiest way to do that is to remove the option of a clean install.

jailbreak,3dqf32,Justintime333,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:13:06 2015 UTC,Are you using Copic? Or what?
jailbreak,3dqf32,Secretss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"No, there's just no option in messages customizer to remove the bubbles from group chat"
jailbreak,3dqf32,Secretss,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:22:40 2015 UTC,Copic has an option to hide them
jailbreak,3dqf32,atmosVII,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"I've never used group chat on the messages app and I'm really curious, does group chat only work with people who are on iMessage? What if you start a group with almost all iMessage users and one Android user? Does that one guy get left out?   I just conjured a hilarious scenario that iMessage would - on your and your friends' iPhones - acknowledge that the Android guy is in the chat, and thus automatically forward as SMS every text each of you send to the group chat to him. And because he's on Android, he doesn't have a group chat so he'll get disjointed messages coming to him in multiple conversation threads, one for each friend. And you can keep adding more iMessage numbers to start more threads on his phone. Oh what a way to prank people!   I wish I had more friends on iMessage. It annoys me that I have friends using iPhones and they still don't use iMessage."

jailbreak,3drmdv,iammrh4ppy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"The closest thing to tasker, App Store wise, is Workflow IMO.   In the jailbreak world there really is no such tweak/app. Activator opens a few doors but that's about it."
jailbreak,3drmdv,grapplerone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Tasker == God for android devices haha
jailbreak,3drlmi,rabbitvinyl,3,Sat Jul 18 19:56:35 2015 UTC,Uninstall Messages Customizer and report back...
jailbreak,3drlmi,mwoolweaver,2,Sat Jul 18 20:00:36 2015 UTC,"...it works now. Thanks for the suggestion - don't know why I didn't think of that. Guess I thought that if I had never enabled the tweak, it should not have been causing issues."
jailbreak,3drlmi,_Decimation,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:25 2015 UTC,You need the one from chewitt.me/repo/
jailbreak,3drlmi,mwoolweaver,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:22:17 2015 UTC,even that one caused me issues tbh...
jailbreak,3drlmi,_Decimation,2,Sat Jul 18 20:25:23 2015 UTC,It's really buggy
