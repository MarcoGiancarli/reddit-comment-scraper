comiccon,3e3417,cdsam4,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:18 2015 UTC,Last year I shattered my ankle badly on the sidewalk outside of comic-con. While writhing in pain on the ground and screaming many attendees chose to walk over me and past me until a young lady gave me a pillow and stayed by my side calling the ambulance. Firefighters showed up and stood over me and protected me from passerbys until an ambulance navigated through the horrid comic con traffic to save me an hour later. They are my heroes.

comiccon,3dzf89,housecatspeaks,5,Mon Jul 20 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"My friends and I camped out Fri night to get Funko Sat morning. We were one of the first 50 people into the hall (literally I think we were 5th row from the front where the rope is), and because I didn't know about a ticket system they implemented, I got screwed, and accepted my fate. However, my friends were all able to get a ticket, so they got in line right away. Some lady with her like two kids come by and asked if they could cut in because they had tickets also, and my friends let them cut cause they're good peeps. Then the dad forces his way in there ""to be with his kids"" and tried to buy the set (Cause you know...a family of four needs a set per person). They wouldn't let him, but he kept arguing so they gave him a VIP pass to come back on Sunday to buy when he didn't even line up, didn't camp out, didn't do anything other than be a complete dick to others. This is why I hate the Funko line. If you're complacent with their directions, you get fucked; but act like a belligerent cockgobbler and you get your way.   What they should have done, and this would cut off a lot of pushing and shoving to get to Funko, is to hand out tickets as people are upstairs waiting to be let in to the exhibit hall. You KNOW they're not exhibitors, because they are waiting to be let in instead of flashing an exhibitor or professional badge and skipping the line."
comiccon,3dzf89,wellifyouinsist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"I'll admit I cheated the line for Funko Sunday. The ticket thing is bullshit, they gave me one as I was hovering around the funko booth so decided to see if I could get something even as an exhibitor (I really don't care for Funkos). And here is where my improvised plan worked, I had an extra comic con ticket that was a 4 day pass so I just swapped my badges  Again I apologise but I only bought ant man because it's was a present for my dad."
comiccon,3dzf89,comedypros,4,Tue Jul 21 12:29:19 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever been as insulted before on the basis of my disability as I was at that booth this year. No one would help me or give me the time of day. All I was trying to do was ask how things were being run so I knew. And then the main line guy started shit talking me to a security guy I guess for having the audacity to ask for help. I'm done with their booth at SDCC.

comiccon,3du2rc,Doc_Machine,3,Sun Jul 19 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"You will start to get more spam snail mail too.  It shares all of your info, I think, not just your email address.

comiccon,3dup97,whatisburnnotice,4,Sun Jul 19 17:35:34 2015 UTC,Honestly? There are so many locals looking to get out of Downtown and the Gaslamp that weekend that it's much cheaper to arrange to sublet an apartment or condo. You can usually get the full week for what one might pay for just Fri and Sat at a hotel.   I just started driving my camper out there and posting up at the vacation rental parking lots on Imperial Beach. As long as you get back downtown before around 7:00 am there's plenty of parking.  Just stay awwy from Ralph's!! They'll tow you in a heartbeat.
comiccon,3dup97,Soonergriff,3,Sun Jul 19 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Hilton Bayfront was great.  But the food there was awful!  Everything I ate at that hotel was at best Mediocre and at worst crap.  Great rooms, beautiful, clothes, high quality, but the Food... My god..."

comiccon,3dup97,reavesfilm,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:15 2015 UTC,You can probably book early without issue but you'll be paying 3 or 4x the cci rate.
comiccon,3dup97,Doc_Machine,2,Sun Jul 19 18:16:45 2015 UTC,So in other words no advantage to prebooking :( I've seen a few posts where people refer to booking early and not having to worry about hotelpocalypse so since I'm certain I'm going next year and am willing to risk not getting a badge I thought I'd have a leg up. Darn.
comiccon,3dup97,Doc_Machine,2,Sun Jul 19 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"One year I was able to get a room early through triple A, but it's never happened since. But regular rate for many of the hotels in downtown sd is about 900$/night."
comiccon,3dup97,housecatspeaks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"Well, there is an advantage to booking independent of badge and hotel sales, and you said it yourself --- you get EXACTLY the hotel you want. And you know for sure that you have it. To some people that is more important than money. And you will be able to cancel the room if you find that you will not get badges in the lottery sale. But it is all about money. All rooms in San Diego and outlying areas raise their room rates during SDCC. Even motel rooms out of town. There are people who have said that they pay $800 to $900 a night for their room during SDCC. If you have money, then the pleasure of staying in your preferred hotel is what you pay for. For everyone else, the SDCC convention rates are the only way to do it."
comiccon,3dup97,trogdor1234,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:33:31 2015 UTC,I think what has happened over the years is that they have given more and more of their hotel blocks to the convention.  So they have only 10-20% of their rooms left.  They can charge whatever they want basically.  In 2009 right when SDCC started really popping it was cheaper for me to buy Hilton points and use those to get a room at the Bayfront.  Than to pay the price for the room.
comiccon,3dup97,MsMargo,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"This all really depends on the hotel.  Some - like the Hard Rock - will block off Comic-Con week, and you can only get a room through Travel Planners (or being rich and famous).  Some - like the Mission Valley hotels - will let you book a room in advance.  I'm local and have tried many years to get a room Downtown before the hotel lottery opens, but I've never been successful."
comiccon,3dup97,reavesfilm,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:31 2015 UTC,"I've heard this is possible, but every time I've tried to even check rates, all hotels in the area say they're sold out.  I wonder how people are doing this."
comiccon,3duuc6,Firespray,2,Sun Jul 19 18:18:56 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they were there. Near funko booth.
comiccon,3duuc6,Doc_Machine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:56 2015 UTC,"Nope, weren't there. I found them listed in the exhibitors and went to their booth to find... a completely unrelated content company. A rep for that company explained that Retro Outlaw backed out and sold them their booth (their space, I assume). Then he told me all about their new comic.  Sad here too because Retro Outlaw is one of my first stops."

comiccon,3dnx0e,DosAngeles,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"Yes! There's definitely been years where the big action was inside the convention center, but I felt like this year was one of the ""badgeless fun"" years. And that's not a bad thing at all."
comiccon,3dnx0e,cleanscissors,3,Fri Jul 17 22:18:38 2015 UTC,Great recap! I wish I could've been in any of the Conan events :(
comiccon,3dnx0e,EverAccelerating,2,Fri Jul 17 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"For Friday, I had a choice between going to Conan or doing the Hall H thing. My friend had an extra Conan ticket, and my other friends were in the Hall H line (at the island near the symphony area). And honestly, up to about 10pm Thursday, I was still undecided which to do. I was with my friends in the Hall H line, and I finally decided to do Conan.  It was absolutely the right thing to do.  Friday's taping ended up having Walking Dead and Game of Thrones cast, so it was like I saw two of the Hall H panels. Like you said, the taping was an awesome experience. Conan's band was entertaining throughout, and it was great to watch the ""behind-the-scenes"" stuff (ie, commercial breaks).   Also, my friends who did Hall H nabbed me a Star Wars concert ticket, so I went straight from the taping to the concert and got to experience Star Wars as well, especially with the entire Force Awakens cast coming out (and holy shit, Leia is so short next to Brienne of Tarth). And those fireworks! So Friday, I got to experience the best of both worlds."
comiccon,3dnx0e,EverAccelerating,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"Ahhh you got a twofer! My pressing question: HOW WAS THE CONCERT WAS IT CRAZY MAGICAL OH MAH GAH LUCKY YOU??  Soo aside from that: I thought about going for standby tickets for Friday's taping (because come on, it's GoT AND Walking Dead), but then I realized that the show taping would have run into the start of Conan Bingo, and my group decided that we'd rather do bingo since we already saw Wednesday's show. Another reason we skipped out was because - WARNING: first world Comic-Con problem - we'd already seen the GoT and Walking Dead casts in Hall H in previous years, so we decided to use our day to explore more of the convention and take advantage of the thinner crowds. No regrets whatsoever. :)"
comiccon,3dnx0e,jprofetto,2,Sat Jul 18 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"It was great! I should preface it by saying I've been to a Star Wars concert before, around 6-7 years ago when they toured around the country. That previous concert, they played maybe two hours worth of music, including the ones with choruses (Duel of the Fates), and with Anthony Daniels (C3P0) emcee'ing. The SDCC fan concert had maybe 5-6 tracks, no chorus, and they started off with Imperial March and ended with the main theme. The highlights included the entire cast coming out (with Harrison Ford ""hobbling"" out using a lightsaber as a cane). And as night fell, we all waved our free lightsabers. You could literally see THOUSANDS of lightsabers across the venue. The best part were the fireworks during the Star Wars theme. It was completely unexpected (like the rest of the event) and was utterly spectacular since they were shooting off right off the edge of the pier, so we were less than (I'm guessing) four hundred yards from the explosions. Overall, so, so good.  And yes, your reason is the exact reason I went to Conan. I'd been to the Walking Dead / Game of Thrones Hall H panels before, so I really didn't need to repeat that experience. I figured Conan might(?) be a once-in-a-lifetime thing, unless he decides to make this an annual thing. Although I have to say, I was there in 2011 when Conan filmed a segment for The Flaming C art gallery on 5th St. So this is technically my second time seeing Conan at SDCC!"
comiccon,3dnx0e,EverAccelerating,2,Sat Jul 18 01:32:54 2015 UTC,"Man, my group and I weren't willing to spend all that time in line, but that concert really did look like something special. :) And that Flaming C gallery thing in 2011 was AWESOME...that was my first year at Comic-Con, so when my husband (then-boyfriend) and I wandered in we were like ""LOL WHAT IS THIS, THIS IS AWESOME""...then we found out we missed Conan's appearance at the gallery a few hours after we left!"

comiccon,3dnx0e,The_Dalek_Emperor,2,Sat Jul 18 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"The band would play a few numbers. Conan would run into the audience and allow some lucky people take selfies with him. The makeup girl would come out and wipe the sweat off of Conan & Andy. A bunch of stagehands running around adjusting the set. In one break, he just started dancing to the music. In others, he would review the interview questions."

It will probably be the same as this year, where people get selected randomly, so if so, no need to rush, just make sure you are all on the waiting room page by the deadline they specify (~9am I think)!  -Likely you won't all get in, but the one or two who do should then buy badges for the rest of you and your friends. Remember: make sure each friend has ALL the comic con account usernames, as they will need each person's they intend to buy badge(s) for.

comiccon,3dpdp3,MsMargo,3,Sat Jul 18 04:10:31 2015 UTC,"I just think it's silly. If people want to spend [read: waste] their time at the con standing in line to make a little money, then more power to them.  After the eBay fees, the shipping fee, and the PayPal fee, I can't imagine anyone getting rich off of anything. I don't really understand anyone's motivation to do so, but I'm not that type of person. I'd much rather leave the con with souvenirs that I will enjoy then an extra $100 that I will end up using to pay bills.  I don't think the exclusive market is killing the con, at all, especially now that the word 'exclusive' is relative and most exclusives are only an exclusive for a short period of time."
comiccon,3dpdp3,rickythump,2,Sat Jul 18 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"I think if anything its helping vendors at the con.  I personally love seeing the value of things I buy for myself or friends up on ebay.  Of course I have never sold an item i've bought at comic con, but I like to think i could in 20 years if I needed the money, although i'm aware with everything sold the odds are high that in that timeframe they will lose value not gain it.  I also don't see how with the cost of travel, staying, badges, food, parking etc one could make money selling things they buy at comic con.  Either way I like seeing that there is a market for things from Comic Con."

comiccon,3djapz,Bender7,12,Thu Jul 16 18:53:26 2015 UTC,"Fun story:  My friend and I were at E3 a couple years ago. My friend is in a wheelchair (little stamina, can walk but only short distances, long story) and is a HUGE Groening fan. I myself am a fan of Futurama, but not really The Simpsons.  ANYWAY, we were just standing around in the main lobby by the E3 merch booth and I turn and see Matt hovering by the entrance, I almost didn't recognize him he really blends in. I turn to my friend and was like: hey, that's Matt Groening.  His eyes lit up and turned his chair around (electric wheelchair) toward him. He doesn't even look at me as he says to give him his cane and before I even reached back behind his chair he was already standing up out of the chair and lumbering toward Matt like Frankenstein.  My friend tries not to fanboy out but Matt just stood there and chatted with us for a while. It was awesome! Then he took a pic with us and by that time a couple other people recognized him and wanted to get a pic.  To this day that is probably the happiest I have ever seen my friend."

comiccon,3dk0dl,Proxify,3,Thu Jul 16 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"Are you talking SDCC? If so:  The general con is crowded, cramped, and full of a strange mix of hectic energy and window-shopping lethargy. Lines are common, and it's often difficult to tell what a line is even for without asking someone. Sometimes, you'll be walking along, and suddenly traffic will come to a stand-still because some booth nearby will have started giving something away or someone will have shown up for a signing, and people will just crowd that booth. They'll struggle, form a line as they're shouted out by booth workers and volunteers, and many of them won't even know what exactly they are lining up for.  Every year I've been there, the center of the floor has been dominated by a massive booth that is a pain in the ass to get by - Marvel, most years. Lego this year. Others around it, too - Hasbro typically has a giant show booth and a giant shopping booth, DC get's pretty big, other movie studios. Just that whole section is tough to get through, dead center of the floor.  The photographers don't always help. They come in two varieties: The pros, who typically know what they're doing and can take their pics without hurting traffic too much; and the cell-phone snappers who just stop every pretty cosplay girl they see and anyone in a cosplay they think is halfway cool (more the latter), impeding traffic to get that one shot they so desperately desire.  But all that goes away when you get to the comic book booths and the author area. The authors and the comic book sellers are located between the pop-culture show booths and a chunk of collectible sellers, and are packed somewhat tightly. So there aren't as many people here, but movement can still be kinda slow. It's sad, really - I don't see the comic book sellers or many authors getting as much attention anymore. They sit and they chat with their volunteers, the comic book stores try to hock heavily-discounted back issues and show off expensive showpiece books, the authors occasionally give away some free stuff - but many just get passed by as the average Con-goer heads from Pop-Culture Point A to Video Games Point B. Exceptions exist, of course, but comics just aren't the focus of the Con anymore."
comiccon,3dk0dl,N_Who,2,Fri Jul 17 00:15:48 2015 UTC,"Just to quibble with your POV, lol -   Every year I've been there, the center of the floor has been dominated by a massive booth that is a pain in the ass to get by - Marvel, most years. Lego this year.   The layout has been remarkably consistent for the last several years - Marvel, Lego, etc. are all (pretty much) exactly where they've been since at least the turn of the decade. I agree it's tough going in that area but nothing's moved around.   It's sad, really - I don't see the comic book sellers or many authors getting as much attention anymore.   I think more likely it is a case of the Comic-Con ""pie"" expanding so much than actual decline, but full disclosure, I did not visit SDCC before 2005. By analogy, New York used to be a much bigger deal when there were 13 states, and it still is, but there's 50 states now.   many just get passed by as the average Con-goer heads from Pop-Culture Point A to Video Games Point B. Exceptions exist, of course, but comics just aren't the focus of the Con anymore.   Comic-Con's mission has been to promote comics, sci-fi, and the popular arts from the very, very beginning so I don't buy into the ""Hollywood ruined our little comic convention!"" complex."
comiccon,3dk0dl,KirkUnit,2,Fri Jul 17 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to imply the booths have moved around. I know the floor stays pretty consistent, with the only real move I recall in recent years being the video game booths going from one side of the hall to the other.  My statement about the authors and comic book stores was more about them having trouble catching anyone's eye when there's such major Hollywood spectacle going. But, that said, I really like that Comic-Con is about all the popular arts - I didn't mean to come off as complaining about that. Really, my concern for the comic book guys is that Comic-Con started primarily as a place to buy and trade comics lo those 40-ish years ago, and now it seems like they bring very little to it."
comiccon,3dk0dl,N_Who,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"No worries, it read as though there was a major booth that was a problem every year, but really - all those booths are always congested pretty consistently from year to year so just saying that to say, what you're saying is true it's just the same year-on-year.  And no worries about the pop arts issues. I wasn't there for the years and years when SDCC was a much smaller affair - but I really have to wonder just how much floor space the comics sellers have lost as years have gone by - as opposed to staying about the same while the floor itself became so, so, so much larger."

comiccon,3dk0dl,KirkUnit,2,Fri Jul 17 02:09:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, visit another con to get your own point of view. The ""comic book area"" at SDCC - meaning the zone where comic books are for sale or trade - is a minute fraction of the exhibit hall floor and generally not as crowded as some of the high profile 'booths' (Marvel, Warner Bros., DC, Hasbro, Mattel, etc.)  Visit some other comics convention, scale up the crowd you see, and look at a lot of photos of Comic-Con."
comiccon,3dk0dl,quigonjen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:11:45 2015 UTC,I highly recommend tracking down Morgan Spurlock's documentary (Comic-Con: A Fan's Hope) and watching it.  It's the best representation I've found of the experience of and the sentiment behind SDCC.

comiccon,3dfysb,AlmostOnTopic,5,Wed Jul 15 23:37:02 2015 UTC,"OH SHIT!!!!!  AND you had the Mondo Crimson Peak poster, which itself is quite a huge achievement just to get that! This is Most Amazing Fan Experience EVER!!!!!! Congratulations!"
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,5,Thu Jul 16 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  It was so intense!  A little backstory if you're interested; we were walking by the FX area on Sunday morning and saw a small crowd around him, including press and a few bodyguards. He was walking into a gated area and said, ""these are my cousins"" to get the small crowd past the gate with him. My buddy and I tried to walk up as well and got stopped, but Del Toro turned around and said, ""let him in, he's my body double!"" Everyone had a good laugh and we lined up at the building he entered.  After a short wait, he came out and took the time to sign everything, have some small talk, and take a lot of pictures. He talked to me about how amazing the poster looked, took a picture with me while we both said ""twins"". I'm a huge horror fan, and Del Toro is one of my favorite modern directors. I've met a lot of cool people at comic con over the years, but this was the first where I really fan-boyed out."
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,4,Thu Jul 16 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"OMG, your story about this is even more amazing than I thought from originally just looking at your photo. This is incredible! I have always liked how he treats his fans. He can be a very stern director, and very opinionated and demanding when he's working because he doesn't tolerate bullshit. Some of his interviews reflect this, and I noticed it in one of his panels a few years ago. But he can be so outgoing and kind with regular people, and he is so fast to laugh. The fact that he took a group with him behind those gates by saying ""these are my cousins"" is hilarious. Then for him to say ""Let him in, he's my body double"" about you --- well, that's so drop-dead awesome that I'm not sure you will EVER top this for the rest of your life!!!!   :D   Do you realize that you will be able to tell everyone you know forever that Del Toro said this about YOU!!!!  Plus there's the fact that you even BOUGHT the Crimson Peak Mondo poster, because it is so hard to successfully deal with the Mondo booth. And you had the poster WITH YOU. And the two of you talked about that poster together. I mean, this gets more incredible as it progresses. The art on that poster is astonishing on it's own, yet the poster has now been blessed with his personal presence and comments. This whole thing that happened to you is mind frying. I have always told people that the most amazing interactions with the talent at SDCC are the things that happen to us totally by mistake!  For being a guy who can create those dark, disturbing, and terrifying worlds in his films, he is so funny and warm in person. I saw him over at the Hard Rock with Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, and Mia Wasikawska[sp?] as they finished an interview by taking promo photos and continuing talking on a balcony just directly above where we stood on the street. Of course everyone cheered and roared when we all saw this group. Then we were told to be quiet. But what does he do? He kept turning around to the crowd behind him and waving his arm up [behind Tom Hiddleston's back] signalling us to cheer! We would cheer, but then stop. So he would pick another point in their interview to turn around, wave his arm up, and signal us to cheer. He did it over and over every time we got quiet and was laughing at the sheer joy of ""playing"" with the fans and screwing up the interview subversively. When that man smiles huge and beams with pleasure, he lights up the world. When you told this story here, I could totally picture how this came down with you and him, and I can picture him smiling.  You are so fortunate. I am also  massive fan of this guy. Even with the passing of years, I still think that Pan's Labyrinth is genius. I can't wait for Crimson Peak. And you can go to the movie theater and watch that film with the memory of being right there with him, and talking to him, and being his ""twin"". Thank you SO MUCH for sharing your picture and this story!!!!! I will think of you, Del Toro, and SDCC every time I see that poster and watch Crimson Peak.   :D"
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,3,Thu Jul 16 05:15:57 2015 UTC,"Man, you got me pumped up all over again! I'm glad to hear another fan had a great del Toro experience, I love how he interacted with you despite the interview and everything going on. He sounds like he really enjoys his fans!   If you're really interested in grabbing one of the posters,  they're really reasonable on ebay. I've seen most of them go for around 60-70!"
comiccon,3dfysb,cougar572,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:32 2015 UTC,":D It has been so much fun to share these stories with you! I am still saying it: Thank You so much for posting here with your picture and the background of how this came about. [And it really is kind of amazing that you look like you are his BROTHER!!!   :D] Del Toro is definitely a very special person, and he absolutely seems to love and respect the people who follow him. And it is exactly these types of experiences that make all of our struggles to attend SDCC worth it. You'll be stoked to tell this story to people for decades more. Now I'm headed over to e-bay to see what I can find!    :D"
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,3,Thu Jul 16 20:57:23 2015 UTC,The Crimson peak mondos weren't that hard to get. I walked up to the booth saturday afternoon and bought one.
comiccon,3dfysb,newnameforeverything,2,Thu Jul 16 07:56:09 2015 UTC,"I keep hearing that type of thing. In the past I've been so discouraged by the lines, and sometimes the limited numbers of the posters that sell out right away, that I don't even visit the booth. To hear that the Crimson Peak poster was fairly easy to get amazes me, and makes me sad that I do not have one. That artist is terrific, and the poster looks incredible. I would love to have one ... enjoy it for me."
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,2,Thu Jul 16 08:27:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they had tons left on Sunday morning, you could just show up at the booth and get it. It was weird seeing those huge lines on Thursday.  The Jaws poster was the first to sell out, if I remember correctly."
comiccon,3dfysb,newnameforeverything,2,Fri Jul 17 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Oh God ..... This gets more depressing the more I hear about it.   :c      If I had just walked up Sunday morning and gotten one, it would have been perfect. And here I am not even going over there to look. I'm starting to wonder if there are a lot of people like me who have had trouble with super long lines and crowding at their booth, and so we just don't deal with it and just don't walk over there and look. And I have always wished that Mondo was located over in the artists vendors near Artists Alley and not on the opposite side of the convention center. It would just make it more easy for me to check them out that way. Thanks for your input."
comiccon,3dfysb,housecatspeaks,2,Fri Jul 17 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"It's an odd situation with the Mondo booth. The year they had some Pacific Rim posters, I lined up, waited, and bought one. A friend I was with decided he wanted some posters, and another friend asked us to bring him back an Aliens poster. Well we went on Sunday, and no line, we got everything we wanted.  Last year's Batman Animated Series vinyl offerings did sell out super quickly though. I got one, but still, I wanted the Harley Quinn cover, and it was long gone."
comiccon,3dfysb,Heisenbear,2,Fri Jul 17 19:22:29 2015 UTC,"Wow! And how can you possibly KNOW that those posters would still be available on Sunday!! I would never have believed there would have been Pacific Rim posters left at all!!! Or Crimson Peak posters for that matter. And THAT is why we all cram into their booth and wait in 2 hour lines sometimes ..... because we are convinced that we will NOT get anything if we do not get it RIGHT NOW FIRST THING!!! Yet it is kind of like Russian Roulette with guessing what WILL and will NOT sell out fast. I'm glad you are telling me about your experiences too, and other people here as well, because it helps me realize that it is not just me who is sometimes misjudging how to handle the Mondo booth. But to me, all of SDCC is like this, and it is extremely difficult to make the correct decisions all of the time about ALL things you try for while at SDCC."

comiccon,3dfg6i,Doc_Machine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:25 2015 UTC,They can only release what they have left over after the show so your comment about them releasing more than they have in the past is nil and void because they sold out at the show. Ya some will make it on the site but don't expect any more than in years passed.  Also expect it to be tougher because now everyone knows what day to camp out on the website. last years sold out in what 5 mins....Expect faster this year.
comiccon,3dfg6i,Aerros1,6,Wed Jul 15 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"We'll see.  They have ""sold out"" of MtG sets every year at the con, and every year they have been available online.  I never said they wouldn't sell out quickly on the site, I said that them releasing a date is suspicious - there has to be a reason they decided that this year would be the year they told everyone."
comiccon,3dfg6i,Aerros1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"But you also said   "" it makes me think they are going to release more than they have in the past""  Yeah they sell out every year but they hold on to a number for defect returns and the like at the show. That is what they come back with and hits the site. It's a small number.  I don't think it's suspicious. I think someone finally pulled their head out of their ass at HTS and decided it wasn't fair to everyone, when they ninja list stuff like they have been doing for years only allowing people with no life or website monitoring scripts to have first crack at them."

And that is saying a lot! I even stayed and watched as you folks took off the heads and talked together. You made me smile and laugh uninterrupted for 20+ minutes. You guys were a gift!"

The experiences derived from those moments, and the lasting memories of the feelings those moments evoke, affect me through the rest of the years in my Real Life world. The 4 of you captured PRECISELY the EXACT thing that makes the Comic-Con culture so extremely special for all of us. And you looked so FANTASTIC dancing!!!! No way are you ""introverted""!!!   : )   That is the power of cosplay! That is the role cosplay plays in enhancing our personalities and our lives! People who do not understand cosplay do not understand the transformation it offers us as we grow and define who we are, even to ourselves, and even at any point in our lives.

Plus, he had Anime Expo the week before... so, yeah, even though I don't get a post-con sadness, I see it in him and I feel for those of you who go through it. :(  Hope the blahs leave soon!"
comiccon,3daaqc,SoCalNerdGal,3,Wed Jul 15 02:07:19 2015 UTC,"Gosh, I can't imagine what he goes through. Your support must mean the world to him and I'm glad there are people like you out there!"

comiccon,3daaqc,brycedriesenga,12,Tue Jul 14 20:59:13 2015 UTC,This is pretty cool. Thanks OP.   I'm already getting the itch to go back next year.
comiccon,3daaqc,k929,3,Tue Jul 14 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"I'm officially making plans for next year.  I have some nopes including that I'm retiring from Hall H lines.  I don't think, for me, anything could top Star Wars so I'm just going to let that be it for me.  Also, nopes to limited signings.  Three hours waiting on Stan Lee chance just to watch some bitches cheat by grabbing multiple tickets at a time and then, sneak their way back into line for more chances only to cheat again.  Definite yes's to taking the cats with me and more sketches/commissions/art.  Yes to preview night.  This year I really discovered that things I'd been warned against were things that were actually a really good match for me."
comiccon,3daaqc,SoCalNerdGal,3,Wed Jul 15 02:10:27 2015 UTC,I'm curious... what had you been warned against that worked out for you?
comiccon,3daaqc,MsMargo,2,Wed Jul 15 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"Well, preview night, for one.  Every one always told me it was horrible and crowded and people were angry and pushy.  Maybe they are and I just had a good year but I didn't experience that at all Weds night.  In fact, I loved the fact that I could venture around the floor and plan an attack for the rest of the weekend.  It was a good test run and made all of my other floor visits feel less pressured.  I even had preview night passes that went unused before because I always heard such bad things about the experience.  Also, warned against taking pets with me; even by hotel staff.  I have a special needs kitty, though, and she gets medicine a few times a day and needs humidifiers running constantly, etc.  It's a bit more involved than just a pet sitter and every other year we've left her, we come home to a major vet bill to straighten things out.  This year, we took her and aside from her freaking the hell out as they were taking off the building wraps, it was a much better experience than leaving her with friends/family/pet sitters.  I know everyone's intentions were good in offering that advisement and it may yet prove to be true, but for this year, I'm glad I went against it.  I'm going to try both of those things again next year.  Of course, if we're lucky enough to get preview night and/or one of the pet friendly hotels.  Our luck might change my plans, though..."
comiccon,3daaqc,SoCalNerdGal,9,Wed Jul 15 02:40:48 2015 UTC,I took a picture Sunday night from the Bayfront Hilton.  I always stay Sunday night and go home Monday.

comiccon,3db839,housecatspeaks,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"Someone is definitely down voting very broadly. Sometimes everything is down voted across all posts. Sometimes it seems that people are targeted. I say this because I notice patterns. And because there are times when anything I say is down voted whether it is a post or the comments in a post, and this can go on for weeks. I've noticed that if I post any links to the SDCC Unofficial Blog, it will immediately be down voted. In fact, that seems to be how it started with me. At first I thought someone had programmed a bot to do this, but now I think I can tell when the perpetrator does not come onto reddit because there is a gap in the down voting. The down voting affects whether a post can even be noticed by people because it will have a zero and is placed lower on the front page. Sometimes I've noticed people get very offended that their comment, which was reasonably stated and contributed to the discussion, was down voted. One person was so upset by this when commenting that I almost wrote them in the comments and told them about the down voting problem we have here so they could know this wasn't a personal attack on just them. It might be a somewhat disturbed person, and there will be nothing that we can do except ignore it, because internet. But it is a pain in the ass."

comiccon,3daca9,CitizenJaggers,4,Wed Jul 15 02:09:31 2015 UTC,I don't think he is saying she isn't handicapped. I think the focus is on that she gets the seats RIGHT next to the mic. There are others in the room. She gets this one so she can spam the microphone.
comiccon,3daca9,StillEdge,2,Wed Jul 15 05:48:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah. In no way am I claiming anybody isn't handicapped that sits over there. They are pretty strict on that shit. In one of my posts I did say some of these handicap sitters bring along huge groups who aren't. If you look up ADA and SDCC on Twitter you can see a lot of handicap sitters complain that they never got in because they only have so many seats and out of nowhere these huge groups get in front of them because they are with other people. I'm definitely not going to sit there and claim who is or isn't. Just saying there are loop holes and shit.

All I'm saying is, there are thousands of other people that also want to have that single minute to ask their question to someone that they idolize...and then you have these people that get into the line every single time, taking the opportunity for someone else who may never get that chance again.

comiccon,3daca9,StillEdge,5,Mon Jul 20 06:36:09 2015 UTC,That kid is with the group I was talking about. They know each other/are friends. I think they all just want to be recognized. Everyone knows the button lady people even know this two-face kid from other cons on your replies. It's rather annoying. Especially since other people waited just as long/longer with most likely better questions and come from more of a true fan perspective instead of just asking questions to talk to famous people. I'm definitely not trying to start a war with the handicap seating at all. Just saying what I see.

comiccon,3df223,theclumsyninja,6,Wed Jul 15 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"I'm exactly the same. Got in 30 minutes before BvsS. The state of ""Hall H nightmare"" was greatly overstated this year. I heard you could walk into Dr. Who 20 minutes before it started, and that you could have gotten into hall H Friday for Star Wars just by waiting a couple of hours, where in years past it was 3am or nothing. Maybe the wristband system really helped? Maybe I want to give a lot more credit to the CCI staff for making it somehow feel less crowded despite it not being. Even the floor felt pretty breezy Thursday and Friday (Did Hall H all saturday). Sunday the floor was surprisingly the worst, maybe it was due to the lack of good panels this year on sunday (my two cents)."
comiccon,3df223,CitizenJaggers,3,Thu Jul 16 00:11:34 2015 UTC,I think Star Wars on Friday wore everybody out.

Next time really try to get into  Ballroom 20 for the Masquerade, obviously bring some water bottles filled with hard alcohol and make friends with everyone around you! Chanting after each number and making jokes really helps make it a fun group experience.  Also: I'm so glad the term Masquerave is catching on ;)"
comiccon,3db3kp,Taurox,2,Tue Jul 14 22:59:06 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on how early you need to get in line for the tickets and how early for the actual show to get into B20?
comiccon,3db3kp,willywonka159,3,Wed Jul 15 01:58:01 2015 UTC,"In the 5 years I've been going I've never once actually needed a ticket. I always get one just in case, but it always just becomes a souvenir and never sees actual use.  You get the tickets for free on Saturday up stairs by the entrance to Ballroom 20. There are booths that say ""Masquerade"" on them. Sometimes there is a super long line, but really go do something else for 20 minutes and come back and the line should be gone and you will then be able to walk up and get as many as you need.  If you don't have a ticket, just wait till 8:30ish and you should be able to walk right in and find a seat. People tend to leave in droves pretty quickly so even if it is filled you shouldn't have to wait long to get in."

comiccon,3d9zu5,doctorngo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:34:52 2015 UTC,"Good to know I'm not the only one then. But I saw the charges on my online banking transactions. However the only documentation I received from the hotel regarding the charges was the receipt they slipped under the door on Sunday morning. I immediately checked my account after receiving the receipt, and yep the amount on the paper was taken out that day. Now today they charged that balance again without saying anything."
comiccon,3d9zu5,doctorngo,3,Tue Jul 14 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"Seems to be an anomaly just on your end. I was charged $50 for every night I stayed, and some unavoidable $23.44 that I can't remember what it was called exactly. The second charges that were made to my account was valet parking (which I did not partake in), which was refunded with no problem. I wish you luck in figuring out your problem. I talked to them and they were very nice, so I am sure they will accommodate you.   See you next year? Open bar and free breakfast buffet is too powerful :P"
comiccon,3d9zu5,doctorngo,3,Tue Jul 14 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"I was charged the $50 per night as well, but on day one, so a total of $200. I do believe that was for the refundable security deposit though. I also was charged a random $18 and two charges for the last two nights. I'm just gonna wait it out until they get back to me. They had really great customer service so I'm sure they won't have any problems in helping me out.   But I'm not sure if we will be staying there next year as it's up to the SDCC gods lol. We had a few problems with valet, they almost lost my sister's car keys and dented her door on the same night. They were nice enough to offer a check for damages after we get an estimate though. The view we had was fantastic though as we had a clear view of the bay, and could see all the way down PCH til the front of the CC."
comiccon,3d9zu5,empee73,2,Tue Jul 14 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Although Embassy Suites may seem suspect with the charges and the incident with your valet, I am surprised to see how accommodating they are.

comiccon,3d9zu5,captnmarvl,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:20 2015 UTC,Slightly off topic but does that Embassy Suites still have the breakfast buffet and free Happy Hour drinks at the bar? That combined with fold out the couch/separate bedroom rooms made a few stays there pretty epic

You should totally setup an official place/event or something next year.  One photographer was taking cosplay photos and handing out cards...""if you like, you can buy a copy from my site"" which felt kinda shady but also a nice service when you don't have pals to take your pic with a high quality pro camera.  Probably against the con rules too...."
comiccon,3d5p6s,GalaxyAssassin,3,Tue Jul 14 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know what the rules are for soliciting in that respect. To each their own, but I feel my photos are more ""floor run-n-guns"" so the thought of charging people to see them would never cross my mind.  I did see someone plant himself near a wall with strobes and light modifiers. I could see his photos looking more like studio shots, and thus cosplayers would definitely be willing to pay for copies."

comiccon,3d5tql,DosAngeles,3,Mon Jul 13 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"I hear the same happened on Saturday morning. If you got in line at 8 or even 9 am, you were in for DC at 10:30."
comiccon,3d5tql,PrinceAuryn,3,Mon Jul 13 22:05:33 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this. I got to the Saturday Hall H line at 9:30. We didn't expect to get into the WB panel, and were looking ahead to Hateful Eight and Joss. Well, we got in to Hall H by 10:30. Total surprise. There were only about 100 people behind us in line so I imagine that it almost didn't fill up. I think the Hall H scare tactics and focus on the campers really scared people away from Hall H this year. The fact that you could do this on saturday, walk into Dr. Who minutes before it started (wish I was checking twitter) and that you only needed to be at Friday Hall H by 8 to get in was unreal and a little disappointing and I would have loved to see that so much, but Imagined that lining up any time after 5am would have been a waste of time. While it sucks to have missed Star Wars, I feel like I'm giving Hall H a shot next year for GOT and Walking Dead."

comiccon,3d6091,Kittiemeow8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think that yelling in a stranger's face about how they're going to hell is the best way to evangelize. For one, you don't know me. I'm already a believer, but did you take the time to ask before banishing me to hell? No. You just went off to my face about how I need to repent. Second, do you really think that telling non believers that they're bad people deserving of the ultimate punishment is the best way to get them to consider Christianity? Generally in a debate situation, insulting someone is seen as the last resort of a contestant who has already lost, and ultimately is ineffective as a rhetorical tool. So if you must yell at people from a street corner (already rude and off putting), yell the positive message if Christ's love. I don't think it will be any more effective, but at least you won't make negative progress by making people think of Christians as those rude jerks who told them that they were going to hell on their way in to the convention center."

comiccon,3d72aq,SouthlandMax,9,Tue Jul 14 00:57:28 2015 UTC,"I noticed this too. Nothing in particular, but a general aggression, the shouting and demands. I understand it must be intensely difficult and stressful from the sheer volume of people, but there's still a line to not be crossed in how you police it.  For what it's worth I only noticed this with the yellow shirted ""regular"" guards. The ""supervisors"" in the blue shirts were polite and friendly, one of them went out of his way to compliment my costume."
comiccon,3d72aq,glitterrage,4,Tue Jul 14 02:58:54 2015 UTC,Security actually was better this year than in past years.  Most of the yellow shirts were pleasant this year.  In previous years they've been on a serious power trip.
comiccon,3d72aq,MsMargo,4,Tue Jul 14 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"My bad experience with security had more to deal with them being ineffectual rather than aggressive. On Friday my boyfriend and I wanted to get autographs from the Steven universe and Adventure Time crew. We showed up three hours before it opened to make sure we wouldn't be late (we went right after the Steven universe panel). There were a few others there and we tried to start a line a few times but would get dispersed every time despite some security saying it was ok to line up that early. To follow what security said we showed up abour an hour and a half early since it was an open autograph event and was first come first serve. Since people who wanted to attend couldn't stand anywhere near where the line was supposed to open, those wanting to attend had to sit in chairs and tables in Sails Pavilion. So, he and I sat in the chairs with others waiting creating an unofficial line. Security saw us and acknowledged what the line was for. To make sure the line didn't clump up and start traffic, security made sure anyone standing was forced to keep walking.   About forty minutes before the line was supposed to open a Steven universe cosplayer began to walk around where the line was supposed to open in circles to avoid the already made ""line."" Fifteen minutes before the line was supposed to open this one person circling became fifty and steadily growing as again people wanted to avoid the line. Of course many of us that were in the unofficial line were getting antsy considering we put the time in to wait for our spots properly. So at one point we (those in the line) thought that the line had opened, so everyone in the unofficial line bum rushed including those circling around so of course it was a giant clusterfuck. People pushed and squished one another in hopes of getting in line.   However, it didn't open.   So since I was pissed I talked to one of the security and respectfully told her how us in the line waited properly and that those people were circling around were cheating people out of spots and should be told to keep moving, and then, to my shock, she told me basically that there's nothing they could do and that we in the unofficial line would be shit outta of luck despite doing what they asked. So hearing that about two hundred or more people began circling the line and since anyone who in the unofficial line would be screwed out for sure. It was so tight between people that a girl had a panic attack and many people were extremely rude to one another.   We both ended up getting a ticket (they changed it to a ticketed event at the last minute to control the crowd) but it was by far a horrible experience that could've been avoided if security exerted better control over the situation."
comiccon,3d72aq,Mazmoria,2,Tue Jul 14 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"I had somewhat similar situation but exhibitors and security were blocked us who stand at ADA line for Crimson Peak signing.

comiccon,3d72aq,DrayevargX,3,Tue Jul 14 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any issues, but on Saturday, as I was walking out of the Exhibit Hall, from what I could tell it sounded like a security guard was laughing or mocking at an attendee, and the attendee confronted him, to which the guard kept trying to grab him and prevent him from going into the convention.  I don't think the guard had any right to, and the guy ended up walking away and into the con. The guard ended up looking foolish in the end.  I don't understand the power trip issue the guards have... seems uncalled for. At this point I feel like SDCC volunteers would do a better job at the doors, and have security backup instead of harassing people at the door."

She's pretty comfortable with that stuff and understands the need to check badges, but she said she felt grossed out and like he was inappropriate by touching her without verbally asking for a badge. She didn't tell me until we were far into the exhibit hall, otherwise I would've gone back and given him a piece of my mind."

comiccon,3d72aq,Sandvicheater,5,Tue Jul 14 04:51:32 2015 UTC,"I always have an issue with security due to me having a general problem with authority but that's a subject for another day...  What I observed with the hired private security at SDCC is the usual needless power trip many seem to revel in. A lot of ""you can't do this or that"" or ""no standing around"", etc. I understand that many of these guys are simply doing their job but many of them seem to lack any common sense and over complicate an otherwise simple solution.  Two things really stood out to me though. One was the badge situation. I assume the order came from CCI but security was really looking for everyone's badges this year. It's been easy to sneak into the convention in the past as well as using counterfeit badges but many guards I ran into had to make a big deal about being sure badges were turned around and went as far as needlessly yelling at attendees for something so small.   There was one guard in particular that got on my nerves. He was working the hospitality suite entrance by himself on Friday night and took his post way too seriously, often yelling at people and stopping big groups to inspect every individual badge. While we were walking into the area, one of my friends had her badge turned to the front and he kept yelling at her to turn her badge so he can see it, is he blind or was it just habit?  The other issue I had with security was the way many of them handled exiting the exhibit hall lobby. At the west end of the convention center lobby, I believe section A or B, the crowd tends to thin out and they made it so every door was closed except for two, one to enter and the other to exit. At the exit door, several attendees tried to exit through one of the many closed doors and the guy guarding the exit started to flip the fuck out and yell at those people and demand that they close the door and exit through his door despite them already being halfway out.  I'll leave this conversation by sharing my experience with being on the other side of the fence. A few years ago, I very briefly worked for one of the private security companies that CCI hires. I'll just say that the company I worked for hires anyone who walks through their door so long as they pass a background check. This company does not properly train their people and throws everyone into the job based on a two hour orientation that hardly had anything to do with being a security guard."

Another woman I guess didn't see my badge so she darted around and reached for it before I leaned away and showed her.  It was quite irritating and there were some rude people.

comiccon,3d7m58,skykingz,3,Tue Jul 14 03:36:40 2015 UTC,The whole point of cosplay...as I understand it...is to make as much of it yourself as possible. Its a creatvie expression. Though you can buy premade costumes.
comiccon,3d7m58,LastRedShoulder,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"There are hundreds, even thousands, of websites and tutorial videos online that guide people with their cosplay designs. A lot of cosplayers I know make their own costumes, but there are designers who do take requests."

comiccon,3d7m58,mildiii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:14:18 2015 UTC,I believe the first step in getting help on your costume might be deciding what your costume is. That might narrow things down a bit.

comiccon,3d4v85,The_Dalek_Emperor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:07 2015 UTC,When I got my tickets for Wondercon this year I got an early invite for pre-sale for SDCC. That's another option there that might help.
comiccon,3d4v85,Mar_de_Lys,4,Mon Jul 13 19:33:10 2015 UTC,"I think you might have gotten this confused. The SDCC pre-sale happened before WonderCon was officially on sale. Every person who has a Comic-Con Member ID was invited to the SDCC public on sale. To register to WonderCon, you needed a Comic-Con Member ID. Thus you were invited to the only public onsale for SDCC tickets because you have a Comic-Con Member ID that was needed to buy WonderCon tickets.  SDCC pre-sale tickets are still only for attendees of the previous SDCC.  Hope that clarifies everything."
comiccon,3d4v85,W10002,2,Mon Jul 13 22:37:07 2015 UTC,Whaaaat. You bought Wondercon tickets and they gave you a free pre-reg code for SDCC? Had you been to SDCC the past year? This is a thing?
comiccon,3d4v85,batRam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:51:51 2015 UTC,"I've never been to SDCC. I didn't know what it was at first so I was confused, but upon reading I saw that it gave me some early access to get SDCC tickets. I already knew I wasn't able to go, so I didn't register through the link they sent me. I got a three day pass, I wonder if this matters?"
comiccon,3d4v85,Mar_de_Lys,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Hmmm well thank you for informing me of this! Anyone else have this same experience? Curious if it's only for three day passes and if you have to buy within a certain time frame or on the first day. I bought three day passes but after I failed at getting SDCC badges at the regular sale, so I obviously never got a code. But since I'm going to Wondercon next year anyway, I'll definitely be hoping for a code!"

comiccon,3d4v85,sarcasticstory,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"As others mentioned, register for a Comic-Con Member ID here: https://secure2.comic-con.org/memberid/new_terms.php  Afterwards, a week before the SDCC tickets are on sale, you will get an e-mail with details and instructions on how to purchase one. New Member ID registration will close randomly a few days before they make this announcement. So register as early as possible.  The public onsale will likely happen next Spring."
comiccon,3d4v85,W10002,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"My brothers friend lost her badge this year (pretty sure it was stolen) so they had to go buy a new one to replace it becuase of that 'special code'(but by this time it was late saturday and apparently they were really understanding and replaced it for free), but, they told them it didn't really matter because there isn't going to be pre-registration for 2016. Any one else hear this? Or is this another case of misinformation regarding badges like the staff telling the ada people that their atendees will now have to try to buy their own badges for next year?"
comiccon,3d4v85,sarcasticstory,2,Tue Jul 14 17:47:27 2015 UTC,Definitely misinformation.  CCI already sent out emails on July 1 reminding attendees to keep their 2015 badges for 2016 Preregistration.

I would say the more popular 6BCF and indigo ballroom panels might move over there.  Overall if it isn't bigger than Hall H then it isn't going to matter much.
comiccon,3d7bj7,trogdor1234,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:01:08 2015 UTC,I do hope they use it for actual programming rather than various sponsored off sites or press rooms or fulfillment rooms/etc. just because they really need another big programming venue and it would be close in distance to the convention center.

We camped out for Friday and my friends sister was able to get in after getting in line at 8 am without having to camp. I read in another thread about the same thing happening for Saturday. It almost seems like less people camped this year.

comiccon,3d6c8u,jaypooner,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"Cooler bags and ice packs. Kept our cold stuff cold and dry. Made sandwiches and wraps. Loaded up on ice coffee cartons and monsters. Filled the extra pockets with cliff bars and jerky. The one we have is small enough to fit under your seat or by your feet.   It'll be heavy at the beginning of your day but by the end it should only have ice packs. My boyfriend and I were able to survive all of Hall H on that plus some water bottles in his pack. The prices for hot dogs in Hall H weren't atrocious but not economic, so, we limited our con purchases. Space out your snacking. Don't absentmindedly munch or you burn through your supply.   I bring a loaf of bread, turkey, sliced cheese, spinach, and a flavourful spread along with spinach tortillas and just make a variety of wraps and sandwiches wrapped in wax paper in the room before we leave. We also go the pb&j route but we forgot the J and it was sad. Also little cuties or clementines are perfectly portable. Just throw a trash bag into your bag so that you can mind your mess."

comiccon,3d6c8u,cleanscissors,3,Mon Jul 13 22:52:42 2015 UTC,"The City has been very careful about maintaining the look/feel of the Gaslamp, so no fast food.  Instead, they have been making it easier for food trucks to work the area."
comiccon,3d6c8u,MsMargo,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"I know, I'm a local here haha. I meant fast food within reach of Hall H within the convention center similiar to how they have Starbucks inside."
comiccon,3d6c8u,cleanscissors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:41 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they don't allow food trucks to drive down the sidewalk along the line. Or presumably it isn't allowed. Didn't see any. Only water bottle guys.
comiccon,3d6c8u,brycedriesenga,2,Tue Jul 14 14:59:08 2015 UTC,Hmm maybe food trucks would create lines that would mess up the flow of foot traffic.
comiccon,3d6c8u,cleanscissors,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:45:12 2015 UTC,I guess that's a fair point. They'd have to have specific reserved areas perhaps if they did so. Like concession stands on a parade route.

comiccon,3d6c8u,brycedriesenga,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:31:31 2015 UTC,It all depends on the line up for that day. If it's something that's going to be insanly popular and its the end of the day then you'll know you're going to need to camp out because the room isn't going to clear as much as something not as popular. For Hateful Eight I only waited an hour and half and got in for it. It also depends on if you want front row too. As for the food part like everyone says bring something with ya. I carried dried fruit/various snacks and a camel bak in a backpack.

comiccon,3d7vsb,cougar572,3,Tue Jul 14 05:46:00 2015 UTC,"4: Win a contest 5: Donate ridiculous amounts to charity when a silent auction ticket comes up for the EW party (who knows, might be a good investment if you spend your evening chumming up to someone that can get your name on the list for future years) 6: Buy a high-priced ticket before they sell out for something like the Marked Men party (the one on the pirate ship every year)  There are plenty of places to go hang out and have a good time that aren't invite-only parties.  The Geek and Sundry pop up party was pretty awesome Saturday night, no cover, no line at Jolt n Joes and Felicia Day covered the tab for the entire bar for what seemed like a really long time.  I don't know for exactly how long--you can guess why.  They've had a party there for the last few years so if you're around next year, you might want to follow them on twitter.  You could also follow websites like brownpaperbag/eventbrite and outsidecomiccon starting about a month out--a lot of times RSVP events will show up there and get filled up super fast.  Just beware of things that have RSVPs open for a suspiciously long time, most likely overbooked to hell and gone and a line will be around the block."
comiccon,3d7vsb,Shavri,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:58:59 2015 UTC,I went to Jolt n Joes on Thursday night and didn't see the usual Geek and Sundry party so I dismissed it entirely for Saturday. Wish I went back :\
comiccon,3d7vsb,cleanscissors,4,Tue Jul 14 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"Most of the invitations are distributed to people within the industry. So a lot of professional badge holders, booth volunteers (not to be confused with SDCC volunteers), and employees of companies that sponsor parts of comic con.  To be honest most (95% SDCC attendees) will never receive an invite to these parties, unless there is a contest to get in. Your better off focusing your attention and time on parties that have tickets for sale, RSVP lists or are part of a panel/fan meetup.  Source: I'm in the industry and went to invite only parties this year"
comiccon,3d7vsb,jhov85,3,Tue Jul 14 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why it is invite only. They don't want SDCC attendees going. If you aren't getting invites just stick to the open ones that the bars hold and shit. At these private parties there are tons of famous people who are able to actually not get harassed as much because everyone surrounding them either is famous or deals with famous people all the time. Most of the time it is open bars/free food so why waste it on allowing randoms in. Also dress code if you are at SDCC you are either dressed up in cosplay or dressed down in comfortable clothing. I have seen girls dressed up in cosplay at these private events, but beyond that there is hardly ever anyone cosplaying at parties. Like I said for bragging rights I get it, it would be cool for you to get into the EW party and what not, but the simple answer the parties aren't there for you. What @jhov85 said is completely accurate, but I feel like the percentage is much higher than 95%.   I only went to one this year and a few last year they are a blast, but you can honestly have that same fun at any party especially if you go to those parties meant for you they will be much more welcoming then the people who believe they are above everyone."

I did Conan Bingo (got lucky with 1iota tickets), Geeks Go Glam (won tickets on twitter), Crave Escape on the Midway (placed as a finalist in a video game cosplay contest*), Geek and Sundry pop up party (was nearby and checking twitter).  Making convention friends in person and on twitter helps too. When I had extra tickets I take someone and usually they reciprocate in some way.  *I figured my chances of getting VIP passes and competing in the final cosplay competition were best if I showed up to the first qualifying round."

But about the Thursday dance party --- If you never witnessed the 4 raptors who took over the dance floor at one point and danced for at least 10+ minutes while the rest of the crowd cheered, laughed, and took photos and video, then you never saw what was undoubtedly the best moment of all of Thursday at Nerd HQ!!  :D"

And the fact that Zach and TNM probably didn't make a dime or possibly spent money to make NerdHQ happen again this year while he has been busy with his own obligations is something great in itself. That being said, I think that they simply did not have the time to truly plan out NerdHQ this year, proven by the fact that they didn't sell tickets for the panels until barely one week before the actual con."
comiccon,3d39f0,wellifyouinsist,4,Mon Jul 13 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"They usually sell them the week before, that's always been the same as far as I know."
comiccon,3d39f0,Firespray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's like this every year. Nerd HQ is sort of the last piece in a celebrity's comic con puzzle so panels don't get solidified until a week before and even a few are announced during comic con like the nerd panel I went to."
comiccon,3d39f0,rockyct,15,Tue Jul 14 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I found NerdHQ this year and last year really bland. Same for the Nerdist Conival which was, as you pointed out, pretty much another Nerd HQ. Playing videogames at the Con doesn't interest me too much as I can do that at home 24/7, and then there's the whole communal controller germ thing. haha. But the rest outside game demos is just like... Statues? Buying their merch? Talking to people who 40% of the time are a good get? I really wasn't impressed. I don't see the appeal of this sort of thing.  The only setup I would compliment this year was Adult Swim. Their carnival was pretty damn fun and we loved killing a few hours there playing free games, and getting some pretty decent free gifts."
comiccon,3d39f0,CitizenJaggers,4,Mon Jul 13 04:58:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was mostly looking forward to it and the Conival because I didn't have a badge for Saturday so I was just hanging out outside the con and I was pretty underwhelmed with the outside offerings this year.
comiccon,3d39f0,nerdwithme,2,Mon Jul 13 05:11:41 2015 UTC,You got to play video games that haven't been released yet.  They were the first sneak peaks at titles that are still a ways from launch.
comiccon,3d39f0,Firespray,5,Mon Jul 13 16:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, the new venue was all right but like you said, nothing much going on there except for the Battlefront demo unless you had tickets to the panels. I still don't understand why we had to register and get wristbands to get in along with the wristbands themselves not being readjustable."
comiccon,3d39f0,cleanscissors,2,Mon Jul 13 04:32:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently they told people when they registered that the wristbands didn't loosen but when my friend and I got ours their internet was down so they were just handing them out and made no mention of it.  But I think part of the registration process was so they could monitor how many people were coming in/going out so as not to go over on capacity, which obviously is way smaller at the museum than it was at Petco."
comiccon,3d39f0,britsterrett,4,Mon Jul 13 04:38:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with the BattlefrontHQ, well at least they made me a believer and I'll probably get a PS4 and buy Battlefront now."
comiccon,3d39f0,MsMargo,3,Mon Jul 13 05:04:45 2015 UTC,I didnt like the drink ticket or wristband reg. Created too many lines for an event that used to be a straight walk in no problem.
comiccon,3d39f0,speedyharper,3,Mon Jul 13 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't quite get the scan-on-the-way-out.  Our girl barely even bothered to scan anyone, just sort of waved the sensor at them."
comiccon,3d39f0,anastus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"some didnt have to get scanned on the way in (ie, if you were doing a photo op), so that can be why? or to probably see who is coming in/out as most venues i went to had physical clicking system to mark everyone entering and exiting (ie - indigo)"
comiccon,3d39f0,retrovm,2,Mon Jul 13 23:30:53 2015 UTC,I dunno. The Nerd HQ party on Saturday was one of my highlights. Getting to dance with Zach Levi (he jumped into my circle of friends on the dance floor) and just go wild for a while was really nice after all of the lines and sitting all day.
comiccon,3d39f0,Yitsul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:37 2015 UTC,"thursday night was super fun with minimal waits, but saturday night was a disaster. we got in line around 11pm (the line moved quickly) and all they did was check IDs, wave us in, didn't scan anyone.   once we got in it was totally jammed with people, and the line for the bar was insane. we waited in line for 30+ mins, had drinks made.. only to be told that they're taking tickets and no cash/credit; this was not an issue on thursday as they were taking normal-ass forms of payment. the ticket thing was posted nowhere else, and nobody at the door told us anything, legit zero communication. the bartenders had most likely been hearing this all night and were really brusque about it.  once we got our drinks, we went to dance on the crowded dancefloor to almost the same playlist from thursday. then we waited over an hour as my other friends were outside stuck in line, which never moved except for when people bailed out because the wait was too long; needless to say, they were pissed, they've never been bounced from NerdHQ before.  AND all this was happening while celebrities were being waved in one after another, which is frankly disappointing and not what NHQ is supposed to be about. the venue change hosed the whole experience IMO."
comiccon,3d32ks,CitizenJaggers,23,Mon Jul 13 03:18:40 2015 UTC,"Getting inside the exhibit hall so that you can line up to buy exclusives (Funko, Hasbro, Mattel, etc.) is a cluster fuck. Exhibitors should not be allowing other exhibitors to line up or pick up tickets. I honestly think at this point that it should become a randomized lotto type system to allow people to buy. Cause I'm seeing 2015 exclusives being marked up 2-3x the price being sold at other booths. Shits insane in my opinion"
comiccon,3d32ks,TrigunReaper,7,Mon Jul 13 05:45:59 2015 UTC,"What I've heard is that some booths don't allow exhibitors to purchase before everyone else, so they have their regular badge plus their exhibitor badge. That way they get in early, line up, and have their regular badge for purchase. Maybe it's a rumor, so it would be cool if an exhibitor could confirm or deny. Exhibitors getting crap before everyone else because they can abuse getting in earlier than everyone is pretty infuriating."
comiccon,3d32ks,TheAndroidsConundrum,6,Mon Jul 13 06:16:48 2015 UTC,"Doesn't this fall on the exhibitors selling the product, though? If doors open to the general public at a certain time and there's already a line before that, shouldn't the exhibitor selling exclusives know that something is up, whether the purchasing exhibitors swapped out their badges or not?"
comiccon,3d32ks,batRam,3,Mon Jul 13 07:06:32 2015 UTC,"If the ""exhibitor"" is switching to an attendee badge, I could see how this would be really hard for the selling booth to deal with even if it does seem a little fishy.  At around 8:45-9:00 there is a weird conglomeration of people on the floor and they start to let in handicapped/attendees as well as feed in people from the sails and other exhibit hall lines.  Many of the ""exhibitors"" in the lines when I got onto the floor this year looked like regular attendees (i.e. Mom and 2 pre-teen kids)--I wouldn't want to be the Funko seller that has to tell the two 13 year olds I just saw them in another booth an hour ago and call out their mom in front of them for being a jerk badge-switcher."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Good point. That makes more sense, I've never had the full San Diego Comic Con experience so I'm kind of theorizing here. I have been to other large cons though so my idea was that if doors open at say 10am, even if there's a few people in line already, suddenly when there's a large mass of incoming people it becomes obvious that it just now opened to the general public. But if they let certain people from the public in earlier due to handicaps or other reasons then I imagine it does complicate things, like you said."
comiccon,3d32ks,batRam,3,Mon Jul 13 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"I've given up on exclusives because it's such a mess to try to get one. Especially Funko, that line always seems to be capped."
comiccon,3d32ks,cphers,12,Mon Jul 13 19:14:16 2015 UTC,"As always, the fact that there are way too many exhibitors/vendors that are capping lines before the regular general public that literally had to camp out all night as soon as the doors opened."
comiccon,3d32ks,wellifyouinsist,4,Mon Jul 13 05:01:15 2015 UTC,Amen.  I don't know anyone who was in line to get in (and I was very near the front Preview Night) who wern't kicked out of line.  (coming in from above G on that escalator.
comiccon,3d32ks,tardis777,2,Mon Jul 13 12:48:15 2015 UTC,"It's insane. I have a professional badge, so I was able to access the convention floor a few minutes before the general attendees. Each morning, there were maybe like 50 people waiting with me in the mezzanine section, and I know they weren't all going to the same place, and yet every morning there were about a hundred people before me for an exclusive. How is that even possible?"
comiccon,3d32ks,whatmeworkquestion,2,Mon Jul 13 20:37:38 2015 UTC,That is my same question! Last year I got in about 5 mins before the floor opened and sprinted to the marvel booth.... sprinted! to get a ticket for a signing session. When we got there (still a minute or 2 before the convention floor opened) there was a massive line and all tickets disbursed. About a few minutes later you could see the wave of people running to marvel.   They should really find a way to remedy that
comiccon,3d32ks,jhov85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, I didn't know Pro badges got special privileges for hall entrance.  Is there a line for Pros on the mezzanine level and if so, how do you access it in the morning? Through the stairs/escalators behind the Sails? I thought Pro badges were not separated from regular attendees by anything except how you got your badge. (i.e. through employer/business connections versus purchasing through attendee sales) and that you get a ""Pro room"" with some drinks/snacks to network."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well supposedly. To the left of Ballroom 6, there's one door open that leads to the escalators, and in the hallway on the mezzanine level Pro Access folks could line up away from the general entrance lines. Whether we were ever actually let in any earlier or not is impossible to tell, however, because by the time I got to the floor there were already swarms of people each morning."
comiccon,3d32ks,whatmeworkquestion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:04 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting.  Never knew about this.  Thanks for the info."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,24,Mon Jul 13 22:47:49 2015 UTC,Hall h is dead to me. They released the wb trailers the same day. What the hell did we camp for then?
comiccon,3d32ks,loganfire3,13,Mon Jul 13 03:24:30 2015 UTC,"This was the first year I didn't sleep out in the Hall H line and I'm honestly happy I didn't. Yes, the crowd reaction when seeing new trailers is awesome, and Tom Hiddleston coming out as Loki a few years ago and doing that monologue was the coolest thing ever, but after having to get in line last year at 4PM for the following day it just didn't seem worth losing a day and a half for. I don't regret not doing Hall H this year."
comiccon,3d32ks,GoGoAuto,4,Mon Jul 13 06:09:43 2015 UTC,It was pretty awesome this year because 6:30-7:30ish you could get in any day to Hall H.  This was the easiest Hall H year I have had in a while.
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,4,Mon Jul 13 13:53:47 2015 UTC,Same here. We basically walked right in to Hall H for the trailer park panel and had great seats for the Doctor Who panel. Maybe 10 minutes total spent waiting in line.
comiccon,3d32ks,atheistpiece,3,Mon Jul 13 15:13:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Hall H was an anomaly this year.  I missed camping out for Doctor Who this year in lieu of Gravity Falls, but I ended up walking into Hall H for Doctor Who 15 minutes before the panel started.  Seats were pretty far back, but surprisingly closer than I expected (maybe like 1/3 of the way in the back and on the side near the exit)."
comiccon,3d32ks,NovaHyperionPPDC,3,Mon Jul 13 15:26:02 2015 UTC,"I think people are scared off by the big lines, early campers, and horror stories of line cutters, etc. All the hype just makes me go to other smaller panels instead."
comiccon,3d32ks,futurestartsslow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:28 2015 UTC,That's awesome to hear. Next year I'll probably give Hall H a shot in the morning because I've read from quite a few people that they had the same experience as you.
comiccon,3d32ks,GoGoAuto,2,Tue Jul 14 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Think about what an investment Hall H is now-- now that they give wristbands out in the early evening, you have to basically sacrifice the entire day before you want to get into Hall H if you want a chance at one. Seeing people lined up and camped for hall H the next day along the harbor was kind of heart-breaking."

comiccon,3d32ks,ghost661,8,Mon Jul 13 06:34:39 2015 UTC,For suicide squad exclusive trailer and concept art for the entire justice league.
comiccon,3d32ks,Jkbdm,3,Mon Jul 13 04:07:36 2015 UTC,"I guess, but I honestly have to ask myself if the 1 or 2 things I exclusively saw were worth it. Especially when they start live chasting next year"
comiccon,3d32ks,loganfire3,7,Mon Jul 13 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"The camping, meeting new people, being shamed in line, being around 7500 people and feeling that energy after seen something can't be replicated by watching it on a phone or laptop."
comiccon,3d32ks,Jkbdm,5,Mon Jul 13 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"it was a fun experience, camping out and making friends. atleast, it was for me, and i was a first timer."
comiccon,3d32ks,Axemurdererpenguin,5,Mon Jul 13 05:11:26 2015 UTC,"I got in the Hall H line saturday at 9:40. I got a seat in the WB panel that was supposed to start at 10, (got in around 10:40, started at like 11?). I didn't mind. haha."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,6,Mon Jul 13 06:46:29 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people came to the same conclusion as you this year.  Surprisingly, there were a lot of times you could just walk into the back of Hall H this year despite the majority of the people at the front camping and waiting for days.  It meant the die-hards were still there, but everyone else just took the ""I'll give it a shot"" attitude without over-investing their time.  Since you don't know what kind of experience the panel is going to provide, it really is a crapshoot as to whether it's worth the long camp or not.  For me, I decided that any ""first-to-see"" footage is never worth it--I'll just see it when the movie/show/footage comes out.  The only thing I would consider camp-worthy is something like the Hiddleston/Loki performance and that I can see in the playback room if I can't make it into the panel after waiting a reasonable amount of time."
comiccon,3d32ks,batRam,3,Mon Jul 13 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"I mean, they're damned if they do and damned if they don't though, no? Someone is going to leak it anyway, poorly filmed like shit on a camera phone at an awkward angle so they don't get caught. If I was WB I'd want people to make sure they saw it the way it was meant to be seen. And I'd say it's still cool to see it first in a room full of other people going just as apeshit as you (although not worth the overnight for me anyway). I didn't get to go this year but from an outsider, to me the Star Wars panel really did seem worth it. JJ really seems to want to go above and beyond for the fans, and I'm not sure how much say he had in all of it, but regardless everyone got a unique experience at that panel that the people at home or reading re-caps online did not get to share."
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,2,Mon Jul 13 07:01:44 2015 UTC,"Look at what happened to exclusive content.  A shitty cam version gets leaked online.  Deadpool and suicide squad leaked. They won't release something they don't want online any more. I think just about 50-75% of their ""comic-con"" trailers end up online after (or sometimes before) they show it In Hall H."
comiccon,3d32ks,futurestartsslow,11,Mon Jul 13 13:52:13 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts:   Mad props to the Volunteers and CCI staff. Many positive experiences with them. Always friendly, upbeat, and helpful. Today Duff Goldman from Ace of Cakes was scheduled in a very small room that drew a far bigger crowd. The staff and volunteers were friendly when asking us in line not to block the doors and worked to fit as many people into the room as possible, lining the walls of the room. They all clearly enjoy working the Con and want people to garner a positive experience.   On the other hand, security per usual wasn't quite to that level. Miscommunication amongst the various companies, ""MOVE ALONG"" yelling, and just this need to take their jobs far too seriously continue to be an issue, though it does make the security who aren't like that far more noticeable. Shouts to the personable security guards, you're the beacon of hope. Also didn't hear that much ""YOU CAN'T SIT THERE"" this year. Also shouts to the people running various SDCC twitter accounts, particularly the Unofficial SDCC Blog, Ballroom20Line, HallHLine, etc. I'm constantly amazed at the lack of communication from SDCC Official, particularly on Twitter. I wish we would get official updates on line statuses, wristband distributions (what letter are they on?), autograph tickets, policy changes, etc. Instead we get PR for panels and complete silence. The power of twitter for crowdsourcing all this information unofficially is incredible and so helpful.  Scheduling still had major kinks that need to be fixed. I'm really curious as to whatever system SDCC uses, because obviously there's conditions put in by the big networks, studios and talent for what rooms, times, days, and before/after for their panels. It's always frustrating to see Hall H/B20/etc. be a walk in while rooms like Indigo, 6A, 23ABC, and smaller are turning people away. For example, why was the Avatar/Korra comics panel in 23ABC, a room with a capacity for 374, when previous years the franchise had filled B20 with 4800 people? I understand it's the comics and not the show, but why not schedule it in the day in a room like 6BCF or 6A? Why not spread the massive Cartoon Network/Adult Swim/Bobs Burgers+Archer chunks amongst several days in Indigo due to the low turnover in the room throughout the day? In addition there also seemed to be a lack of nighttime programming this year compared to years prior, but that's the least of my issues. Tents for Indigo line. Please! The app was much better this year than years prior. Do wish Exhibitor schedules could be included."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,5,Mon Jul 13 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"Just want to pass a long a few things I've heard explaining the scheduling from the in-person talkback panels.  I totally agree with you about Twitter/social media and tents for the Indigo line though!  So for scheduling, it's is not SDCC's decision a lot of the time what size panel room the programming goes into.  From what's been mentioned by CCI staff before, apparently there is a lot of discussion back and forth with studios/content providers about what size room they want to be put in because they like it when there's a crowd to get in and having the room full--it creates a sort of buzz/energy--rather than having the room not filled.  Basically, anyone interested in PR doesn't want to have a panel end up looking like Kevin Smith's panel this year.  So studios will actually say they won't come with the planned panel unless they get a smaller room.  (This was apparently the case for several years with putting extremely popular shows like Game of Thrones, Walking Dead, True Blood, etc. into Ballroom 20 which was clearly too small to handle the interest these shows generated.)  I suspect that even with smaller shows like Ace of Cakes, it is still the case that the studio would rather have the room filled with a line out the door then having a larger, semi-filled room."
comiccon,3d32ks,atheistpiece,3,Mon Jul 13 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, security per usual wasn't quite to that level.

Shouts to the personable security guards, you're the beacon of hope. Also didn't hear that much ""YOU CAN'T SIT THERE"" this year.   I think to this point, they had lots of signage this year that clearly stated you can't sit here, so they didn't have to do as much yelling.    I did have a security guard yell at me for standing near the restrooms, but once I explained that I was waiting for my 8 yr old niece, she relaxed a bit."

comiccon,3d32ks,atheistpiece,19,Mon Jul 13 04:55:38 2015 UTC,"What I would like to see is a system implemented where they scan your barcode and then text you to let you know that you should report to the booth in the next 30 minutes to enjoy the experience. They already can scan the badge and get your address, why not make your phone number one of the fields.  You get the text, report to the booth show them the text and boom, you get to wait there for 20 minutes to  go see the ash vs the evil dead trailer.   Don't have a cellphone? Here is your standby line that should be considerably less shitty to deal with. Those of us with cellphones, you get to virtually wait in line and go spend more money elsewhere.   Obviously, this is a back of a napkin brainstorming, but with some real thought, I bet a decent system could be made that many people will continue to complain about."
comiccon,3d32ks,futurestartsslow,7,Mon Jul 13 05:34:38 2015 UTC,I actually really like this idea for exhibitor booths. It's basically the whole virtual fastpass thing at Disney.
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,3,Mon Jul 13 05:58:13 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea and I'm sure the exhibitors would all love to scan your badge so it sounds like a win-win.  The only thing I could see preventing it is practical logistics.  Over the years I've seen some booths try to schedule experiences--i.e. handing out timed tickets, etc. for people to come back.  It never seems to work ideally because people go off and do other things and then decide they can't make it back for their time allotment.  That can leave the booth in an awkward position of having space, but no one to fill it.  So then they will start taking people walking by because they don't want to have an empty/half-filled booth and then you will wind up with the same problem anyways (and probably people complaining when they show up 5 minutes after their window and beg to still be let in).  So yah...I think the booths just take the easy route and kind of like the buzz about how hard it is to get into their ""popular"" booth."
comiccon,3d32ks,citruselectro,6,Mon Jul 13 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"For the past few years Lionsgate's booth has been a clusterfuck but this year, it was super managed and the staff knew what they were talking about.

comiccon,3d32ks,melloniel,7,Mon Jul 13 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"The Lionsgate booth was fantastic this year, for sure. The poster line went incredibly fast and was well organized.

On a serious note,  the ""not a line"" lines are actually a safety hazard which is why they are frowned on.  The only reason I ever do it is if I'm the only person waiting to get in the line, and I usually just hover or walk in a circle but I tell the last person in line ""I'm after you as soon as they allow more people"".. then it's just about being attentive and quick on the jump.  If too many people gather I warn them about security breaking us up and moving us all along.  It's a good reason they cap lines, the complaint should be against the city for not starting expansions on the convention center yet, we need to expand badly and the limited room is hurting the experience now."
comiccon,3d32ks,selfreference,7,Thu Jul 16 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't have any issues with CCI, everything appeared to go smoothly. This was our fourth year and I found the attendees and exhibitors to be ruder than usual. In a smallish spotlight panel (in 7ab) two people sat directly behind us and had a normal volume conversation. Not before or after, it was during the panel. The line control/room management people saw them and didn't say anything. Then at the Vamplets booth, the seller asked me if I had heard of them and I mentioned purchasing a plush at Denver CC. She said ""yeah, we weren't there, but here's a flyer mentioning the other cons we went to."" I walked away, not giving money to someone calling me a liar. I bought a plush and had a convo about the SD exclusive, they were most definitely in Denver! This was just today. It also seemed super crowded, like they oversold Sunday badges. Sunday used to be the chill day we'd roam the exhibition hall, way too crowded today for that."
comiccon,3d32ks,Taurox,3,Mon Jul 13 03:55:28 2015 UTC,I was just talking with my group about how we all had a more than usual amount of negative moments this year due to rude/mean people and staff. Maybe it was just an off year this time.
comiccon,3d32ks,Hawkman003,3,Mon Jul 13 06:25:10 2015 UTC,"not so much the staff, but this was the first year I was moreso put off by the crowd than inspired. Maybe its fatigue. I felt the whole vibe was a bit more crowded, a bit more pushy, a bit more entitled. many times I sat next to people in panels who talked non-stop. So many times, I mean so many people would stop to take group photos of cosplay in the middle of VERY busy walkways leaving you stuck standing shoulder to shoulder with people for a full minute. The consideration for others around people seemed to have dropped. Oh my god and screaming kids, I really saw a lot more of them then normal this year."
comiccon,3d32ks,mermaidfart08,2,Mon Jul 13 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. This year was probably the year with the most interaction I had with staff and security. For the most part (minus maybe one?) everyone was really friendly, helpful, and just all around cool to be around. The crowd itself is another story. The con definitely oversold Sunday (and I agree, it's sad to see how packed Sunday is now. Preview night too.) and I felt like I dealt with incredibly rude and inconsiderate people Sunday."
comiccon,3d32ks,p0staldave,7,Mon Jul 13 08:01:53 2015 UTC,"First year at SDCC and I had an absolute blast.  Hall H was awesome and well worth the wait for Friday.  I was a bit disappointed to learn that Hugh Jackman (who I ADORE) was at Hall H on Saturday to promote Pan and I think X-Men Apocalypse.  I looked at the Saturday schedule and only saw WB and a few other things.  I didn't put two and two together =( I would have liked for them to specifically put what movies they were promoting but if that isn't how they do things, thats ok.  Next year I'll have a better idea of what to expect and then go from there!   So pumped for next year!! =)"
comiccon,3d32ks,mermaidfart08,4,Mon Jul 13 06:09:59 2015 UTC,"This is the studios who do this I think, not SDCC.  The con sends letters that ask for the info and all they can do is print what they are given."
comiccon,3d32ks,whatmeworkquestion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:03:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, got it! Next time I'll just look to see what Hugh Jackman is in that year and see if the studio will be at SDCC lol."
comiccon,3d32ks,Dolemarq,7,Mon Jul 13 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"I know it's not something that can be easily fixed or remedied, however personally, it seemed like this year more so than any other, a lot of attendees were downright rabid in their fervor for exclusives, or anything free being passed out. I happened to be walking by the Marvel booth on Sunday as they were passing out some comics, which were just some older books distributed months ago for Free Comic Book Day. You would've thought they were handing out $50 bills. People were climbing over each other for these books and I got stuck between a horde and the table. It was bad enough that this poor girl working the booth had to literally yell at a bunch of adults to calm the fuck down. Unreal.   Also, I seemed to spot a lot of blatant scalper-types. The ones who go to SDCC every year strictly as a job to buy and flip exclusives. Two guys I was behind at one point just having an audibly frank conversation about what they estimated the items in their multiple, giant bags were going to go for, etc. I really, really despise these people, because they don't give a fuck about Comic-Con, comics, or anything else that convention is supposed to be about. They're taking up a pass that a fan would love to have just to make extra money..."
comiccon,3d32ks,justakeiteasy,2,Mon Jul 13 20:51:09 2015 UTC,"You and me both. I like a number of the exclusives (I'm not a big collectibles guy, but like have a few odds and ends around that speak to me) but I know to pretty much not even consider it as the stress and fighting to get them is in no way worth it. For example I loved the DKE protesting SDCC Storm Trooper figure quite a lot. But there was no chance with a limited run of 20 and no preview night badge i'd come close to getting that. I did see one on ebay today for $120 dollars, and I can tell you that isn't going to happen.  Also noticed that after the first Conan taping (as I talked about in another reddit post) the ticket scalping prices for his show went crazy, 100-150 dollars a ticket out of nowhere. This was because people we like rabid animals to get a funko toy to either flip or add to a collection. there is one story on here of someone playing games on their phone during the Conan taping waiting for it to end so they could get a Funko. it's real lame.   The one year I did do it was for Mondo posters, and the guy behind me was doing exactly what you were talking about, talking about how much this poster is going to get on ebay and what kind of profit he is going to make. Its real sickening."
comiccon,3d32ks,NovaHyperionPPDC,2,Mon Jul 13 23:22:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly regarding Marvel's booth it's like that every year and a big problem is that Marvel doesn't seem to have a handle on how to properly manage the line. They should demand that people line up to get the comics and then enforce it, like WB and Fox etc. do. And year after year it's a big rush to that table to grab those things."
comiccon,3d32ks,N3rdLink,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yet when you pass by the table at the Marvel booth, they claim that they can't have lines and for people to grab what they can and go, which lead to the people swarming the table because the people behind them are doing exactly that.  They really do need to make a line that flows in one direction when ever they put posters or comics on their table."
comiccon,3d32ks,Dolemarq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:05:57 2015 UTC,I don't see why they can't organize their freebies and have the volunteers pass it out like some of the other booths (Lionsgate is the first one that comes to mind).
comiccon,3d32ks,Offtheheazy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:12 2015 UTC,I agree the guy running the purchasing line could not manage the line properly (even though he gloated about how long he has been at SDCC and how well he can manage a line) Yet he let a group of us stand in line on preview night for 3 hours and we all got nothing.
comiccon,3d32ks,Dolemarq,8,Tue Jul 14 13:11:50 2015 UTC,"Lining up for the exhibit hall entry seems overly confusing. There's only 2, maybe 3 lines... 1 by Sails which is for primarily the new people who got their badges, 1 that lines up around hall G.   I never try too hard to get into hall H or b20 but managed to get into b20 Friday with relative ease to see the DC universe movie, and hall H today. But I feel dissuaded to make attempts to see the hall H/b20 panels that are so big and popular on Friday/Saturday because I have no ability or desire to camp out. (being a lone person makes this much harder).   CCI needs to make the newsletter accessible from their app. The sched.org app/site is easy to use to mark what panels you want to see but it's difficult to navigate to see what's going on outside of that from your phone or tablet. It's difficult to look at what's actually happening in b20/hall H/etc. at any given moment.  What was the policy Lego did for their tickets?"
comiccon,3d32ks,effectivecatch,2,Mon Jul 13 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"For the hall line thing. I personally feel like its better if you are alone and do not want to camp out. Hear me out. I've heard reports of plenty of people making it while arriving early the day of 6-7am? So if you are just willing to arrive early and make it in for the first panel then you are set. Also, many people shift around inside the hall throughout the day and there are always chances to move up especially if it's just one person looking for a seat."
comiccon,3d32ks,xmknzx,2,Mon Jul 13 14:46:05 2015 UTC,I'll make that attempt next year. (getting there that early is also tough for me. Orange line and not being that much of a morning person doesn't help :D )
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,5,Mon Jul 13 15:33:19 2015 UTC,"I have always set aside at least one of my days to spend a majority of my time outside of the con exploring all the stuff outside. This year I was pretty let down. I think a big part is how the Petco Park parking area turned into a food truck area. In previous years, Adult Swim was there, and they had the big funhouse and all of this other stuff, and other stuff was going on in there, like norton's silly superhero camper trailer things, or promotional things for the Mad Max game or Sin City. This year I wandered over there and found a Snoopy jumphouse thing with a huge line, the Dark Souls 3 thing from E3 without the fountain, and a bunch of food trucks. Bummer.  Adult Swim moved to a different area this year, and I did enjoy their stuff and spent some time there, but I think I liked it better when they were in the parking area. The carnival games were fun but I missed the bigger scale things like the funhouse.  On top of that, for some reason on Saturday almost all of the outside-of-the-con things were shutting down super early, like 4:30 or 5 PM. Does anyone know what the deal is with that? They were packed up and closed before the convention was even closed.  Otherwise I had a great time this year.  Lines inside the con seemed a bit more reasonable this year. Or maybe I just avoided the crazy lines.  I'm a huge fan of the Walking Dead Escape, and have done it every year since the first year, but I have to admit this year was probably the weakest. I did enjoy it and I'm rooting for them, so it's a shame to say that I didn't enjoy it as much this year. It was much more story-based and more of an ""experience"" than a run and escape thing. I appreciate the effort it took to create all this and find those great actors (and they were great, everyone did an amazing job!), but I think in terms of fun, it was more fun when it was a free-for-all run, trying to evade and escape zombies.  This was the first year where I had to wait 30 extra minutes at the start, and I suspect the delay might have been because of the preparation time it takes for all the actors to get into their positions and prepared. I found that I had much more fun when it was just like, right from the start, they send you out and you start jumping on roofs of cars and blasting down hallways evading zombies.  Still, it was fun, and comic con in general was fun, and I felt kind of bummed out leaving on my last night, like I always do. That Comic Con energy/atmosphere is something that can't be experienced anywhere else at any other time.  Just wish bathrooms were better and more available. Walked into the public bathroom near the adult swim carnival and saw a stall wide open with no door or wall on it and a toilet staring back, and had to walk another half hour to get to a decent public toilet."
comiccon,3d32ks,Lowbacca1977,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:44:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with you; almost everything outside of the con was pretty lackluster. I liked the food truck option, but it sucks that's really all there was in the parking area. I could understand why they needed a line to manage the people in the Adult Swim section, but I didn't go in because it barely moved. I don't remember the Xbox lounge checking for badges last year, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that kinda sucked."
comiccon,3d32ks,MsMargo,5,Thu Jul 16 14:41:54 2015 UTC,Every year the offsite activities like the FX area take way too long.  Even the shorter lines take an hour or two to do whatever it is.  Only allowing 4 people in at a time at 8-10 minutes at a time doesn't work well.  I'm looking at you bastard executioner.
comiccon,3d32ks,Lowbacca1977,4,Mon Jul 13 14:10:05 2015 UTC,"I'm really frustrated with issues I had finding shuttle stops, also disappointed that the orange route is night time only  I think the fuel rod dispensers that they had throughout were genius, and they kept my tablet running basically 24-7  I'm annoyed with the viral marketing that was creating large groups of people near the gaslamp, as that area was a mess this year. somehow by closing off more streets it was worse than normal over there  I still think that they should have livestream rooms of Hall H and ballroom 20 located at some of the hotel convention center rooms so that people that want to see the panel but don't care about being in the room can see it. I think you could easily double capacity for those things this way"
comiccon,3d32ks,fonixmunkee,2,Mon Jul 13 11:23:36 2015 UTC,"The FuelRods weren't Comic-Con, that was the Convention Center's install, but still good to see more than last year's 2 stations.  Do you think that more people would go to the Playback rooms in the Omni if they included the sneak footage?  They were never near full."
comiccon,3d32ks,anastus,3,Mon Jul 13 22:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not giving comic-con credit on that, per se, but that was still awesome.  And I think the playback or overflow should totally include sneak footage. If they're worried about actually recording it, then just have overflow rooms live streaming. I think part of it is people don't want to wait to hear about stuff"
comiccon,3d32ks,N3rdLink,3,Mon Jul 13 23:03:22 2015 UTC,"This year was first Comic-Con ever. I've tried for six years to get there and finally made it happen.  I had an amazing time. I'd like to thank the Comic-Con staff, the exhibitors and celebs, and most of all, all the other fans. It will go down as probably my most memorable experience, and I cannot wait for 2016."
comiccon,3d32ks,anastus,3,Mon Jul 13 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"My low point for Con was on preview night. A friend of mine, who is obsessed with MtG, had been sitting in line since 4am on Wednesday to get in to the Exhibit Hall so he could get to the Hasbro booth.  We were maybe 20th in line to get into the Exhibit Hall, and some of the first people from that line to get to the Hasbro booth, where we found that a) exhibitors who also had standard badges had taken all the tickets and b) they'd been lined up for hours.  Hasbro, I get it. You don't care where your money comes from. But your reps do claim to care that exhibitors are abusing their privilege of getting in early. Why not hand out the tickets prior to the hall's opening in the future to prevent the colossal clusterfuck that happens every year?"
comiccon,3d32ks,Mantis05,2,Mon Jul 13 20:15:05 2015 UTC,Tip for next time. Never go to hasbro on preview night. Wait until they do the ticketing Thurs-Sun that way you know you will be able to get in. Preview night is a free for all and you pretty much need to be on the floor before the main doors open to even have a chance.
comiccon,3d32ks,Tobias_Funke,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yup. 100% correct. The exhibitors basically cheat into the line long before anyone else can get in.  That said, we did manage to get our Magic cards last year, and I charmed the line guard into giving my friend a pass this year."
comiccon,3d32ks,holographene,5,Tue Jul 14 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"Only had one negative experience. Lined up on Saturday for the limited signing drawings in Sails, scheduled to start at 9. More than 45 minutes passes, and no one from the staff comes over to explain the delay. When we finally do start processing in, no one from the staff apologizes for it, either. Look, I get that Comic-Con is crazy, and hiccups are bound to happen. All I ask is for a little basic courtesy when such interferences happen."
comiccon,3d32ks,Mantis05,3,Mon Jul 13 08:34:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was in that line as well.  It was pretty frustrating.  Also, it seemed a bit.. unfair to me as whoever gets there earlier has a higher chance to draw a ""fail"" ticket since there are more ""fail"" tickets in the bag.  ""Fail"" tickets that are drawn were getting discarded and not put back into the bag.  I was toward the front of the line (got there around 6AM), and once we got into the drawing area, I was the ONLY person in the Felicia Day line.  Grabbed a ticket from a bag (felt like there were at least ~500 tickets in there), and they told me I did not get a winning ticket.  Had to go to the back of the whole line where people were showing up at 10AM after taking care of what they were up early for.  Someone in front of me ""accidentally"" drew 3 tickets, and one of them was a winning ticket and they congratulated him for it.  Luckily, my second time around I was able to grab a winning ticket, but I could have done the same showing up at 10~10:30 AM instead.  I feel like these should be first come first serve, instead of random luck - ESPECIALLY if they are going to let people line up for it early."
comiccon,3d32ks,FKRMunkiBoi,2,Mon Jul 13 16:38:59 2015 UTC,I think the probability would still be the same since I don't think winning tickets are put back in either. But they shouldn't let people draw multiple tickets and count it as a win. Talk about shenanigans...
comiccon,3d32ks,Mantis05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, it really grinded my gears that they didn't seem to cap the line. As you said, it took away all benefit to arriving early. By the time I pulled my first ticket, the line outside had grown so long that they were already three chutes deep and getting ready to make a fourth. It wasn't even worth getting back in line, not when I'd already lost an hour of exhibit floor time."
comiccon,3d32ks,FKRMunkiBoi,-5,Mon Jul 13 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Only had one negative experience.   Which, I notice you chose to focus on instead of the positives. I guess people just love to bitch."

comiccon,3d32ks,ghost661,-5,Mon Jul 13 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"What's the name of the thread again? Talkback. Not Bitchfest. This is not ""dedicated to voicing concerns.

comiccon,3d32ks,whatmeworkquestion,3,Mon Jul 13 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"Two things: The bigger halls like hall h have some of the worst audience questions Ive ever heard. Seems like a waste of very limited time that the panels have. There is an older thread on reddit about it and nothings changed. It seems like the smaller ones are much better. Heres looking at you blizzard fans. Most of them were well thought out and informed questions.  Secondly, I am in the Comic con has out grown San Diego club. It gets bigger and bigger every year and down town San Diego just cant accommodate it anymore. I found it kinda funny that every single time I needed to use the restroom in the convention hall there was a line. Not just for the stalls but for the urinals too. I finally understand how some of the ladys must feel when going to public events.  I do love San Diego though. I miss it already.  I am generally curious about what you guys thought about the hotel pricing? I actually stayed in the hotel circle this year and out of the past four years this was the cheapest its ever been for me."
comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,5,Mon Jul 13 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"What drives me crazy with the questions in Hall H is it literally the same people asking questions every panel.  Don't get me wrong, Button-Lady is an SDCC staple, but seriously, just because the ADA seating is right next to the microphone shouldn't mean they should ALWAYS get to be the first people in line for every panel.  Are the screeners in Hall H incapable of telling people one question per day?  Some of the responsibility for the answers comes down to the panel moderators too.  Chris Hardwick is really good about jumping in and rephrasing someone's question or adding to it after its been asked to give people on the panel a more interesting question to answer.  Just letting the question come in with no moderation if it's really bad is a sign of a bad moderator.  The moderator on the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies panel for example--for the love of all that is holy--I was actually waiting for audience questions because his questions were so bad.  I think that's why Hardwick is basically the go-to guy for most of the studios now.  And I love SDCC in San Diego.  Can't imagine it having the same feel anywhere else.  If you think LA or Vegas would be better just because it would feel less crowded, I don't agree.  Anime Expo this year felt terrible--the air-conditioning in that convention center is awful--and the bathroom situation--don't even get me started.  I have said it on this board before and I'll say it again, I honestly think they should sell less tickets.  Just because they are at capacity  for accommodating the most people possible doesn't mean we are all having a wonderful experience.  I don't like the idea of having less of a chance of getting a ticket for next year, but I do like the idea of actually not wanting to murder every person I come across if I do get lucky enough to get a ticket.  I have no idea what effect selling 5-10k less tickets would have on the overall ""overcrowded"" feeling of the con, but I would definitely be happy if they tried it out one year."
comiccon,3d32ks,futurestartsslow,2,Mon Jul 13 18:46:11 2015 UTC,"It's a polarizing idea on many fronts, because obviously you're saying it's a good idea to give even less people a chance to go, and of course CCI probably doesn't want to lose those 10K ticket sales, however you may be right, or something needs to be tweaked, because while I, and others have had relatively enjoyable, overall positive experiences at Comic-Con, I know there are several who most likely go home far worse for wear due to the sheer overwhelming amount of attendees."
comiccon,3d32ks,ghost661,3,Mon Jul 13 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yah, I know it's a very polarizing idea and I'm not saying that it should be a popular idea, but I think a lot of the negative experiences that people bring up are created by the ""crowd"" and the relative closeness of other people.  In general, we are all exhausted at the end of even just one day of walking around--moving, stopping, going around, being told to move a certain way by security, being moved from one rest place to another by security, being hit, run into, stepped on, coughed on, sneezed on, or entangled with another attendee are so common that I think it actually takes up most of my day now.  That doesn't mean I don't have moments of joy and experiences that I love, it just means I'm WORKING really hard to experience them."
comiccon,3d32ks,TranQLizer,4,Mon Jul 13 21:15:38 2015 UTC,"Last year the Legend of Korra panel featured pre-selected questions that were submitted on facebook/twitter/whatever. While it is a bit of a bummer that those there don't get the opportunity, the quality was SO much better because 1. they were real questions, 2. they were answerable questions, and 3. they were questions the panel wanted to answer!  Too often the ""Questions"" are just statements, gushing praise, personal requests, stupid questions (looking at you person who asked ""who picks out your shirts?"" to the BBT people last year), or questions that the panel just can't answer. I think people get in line thinking their super detailed ""What if this happened?"" ""Is this going to happen?"" kind of questions will get big revelatory answers, but most of the time they just get responded with ""Good question!"",  ""You'll have to watch!"", or ""Good idea.""   I'd much rather here answers that are more anecdotes of fun stuff that happened on set or surprising moments or whatever. Tell me a story, especially because most of the times the people on the big panels are just the actors and don't have that much input into the creative director of a project."
comiccon,3d32ks,growingthreat,3,Mon Jul 13 06:48:21 2015 UTC,"The LoK has the right idea, That sounds soooo much better to be honest. Atleast in the big halls.  Heres a very good example of what I mean from Arrows panel. https://youtu.be/yrIATYxfNo0?t=20m26s.  What the hell was that?"
comiccon,3d32ks,holographene,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:02:04 2015 UTC,They screened the questions. I was right next to the line for people who wanted to ask questions and that guy was sitting in my row. He kept jumping in line again for all the other panels afterwards. I believe he got first in line for Gotham but they pushed him back to third. Probably just a guy trying to redeem himself after such a poor question. That arrow question was so terrible that I feel like he was just nerve-racked.
comiccon,3d32ks,growingthreat,4,Tue Jul 14 04:51:53 2015 UTC,"You'd be hard-pressed to find a city with more built-in tourism support directly adjacent to its convention center than San Diego. There's Vegas obviously, but that's going too far in the other direction (Vegas hoteliers would laugh at CCI if they tried to invoke any clout to control room prices). Anaheim is a nice comparison because its a city with lots of convention support, but their convention center isn't larger than San Diego's, the hotel area is extremely spread out and shared with Disneyland, and public transportation in Anaheim is worse. Where could you possibly go where SDCC would have a comfortable amount of space?"
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,3,Mon Jul 13 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"It will be interesting to see how well Los Angeles does as host of Wondercon next year. I think they've been the dark horse contender for hosting Comic-Con and now the CCI people will get to find out what it's like dealing with the city and convention center.   Having been to a few E3s over the years including last year's, I think downtown Los Angeles would be a lot worse than downtown San Diego, but the Hollywood integration could potentially be even more impressive, with stars and directors making surprise appearances all over the place. Plus, there's always the adjacent Staples Center for future expansion potential. I hear people talk about Anaheim and Las Vegas far more often, but I think Los Angeles is the true source for concern when it comes to keeping the convention in San Diego."
comiccon,3d32ks,atheistpiece,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:52 2015 UTC,"Los Angeles is probably a much worse experience than San Diego. E3 is the closest comparison and that show is a total disaster-- press conferences all over the city, the worst city planning imaginable, surprisingly even less adjacent hotel space, not to mention a significant downgrade in terms of neighborhood. I can't imagine CCI is at all eager to operate in that city, and I'm not even sure Hollywood wants to give up its out-of-town vacation week of drinking and parties on the San Diego harbor."

I actually stayed in the hotel circle this year and out of the past four years this was the cheapest its ever been for me.   I can't speak for this year because I used points and got a free room at the downtown courtyard marriot, but in previous years what I have done is get a cheaper room about 15 miles away from the convention that is right next to a trolley stop. The rooms are decently priced and sure, you have a 30 minute trolley ride down to the convention, but if you stay near the convention you have a 30 minute wait to get on a shuttle bus or trolley stop anyways. At least if you stay further away, you can actually sit down on the trolley instead of standing packed like sardines."

comiccon,3d32ks,cleanscissors,4,Mon Jul 13 07:55:45 2015 UTC,"Well to be more specific, not all the exhibitors are assholes. Just the ones that bought up all the First Order Stormtroopers and sold them for 5 times the original price."
comiccon,3d32ks,rohay,2,Mon Jul 13 16:45:14 2015 UTC,"Those guys are parasites to be sure. But the previous commenter was right, not all of them are awful. I managed to pick up a Jim Lee Blueline Batman from an exhibitor booth for $50. That's $10 more than what it sold for, which I was more than happy to pay just for the opportunity to buy it rather than dealing with the madness of trying to snag one the first go-around."
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,2,Mon Jul 13 20:31:59 2015 UTC,I loved the kindness and integrity of the staff working the Rise of the Tomb Raiders booth in Xbox lounge. They went above and beyond to make it the photobooth an enjoyable experience. Major kudos to them!
comiccon,3d32ks,MsMargo,2,Mon Jul 13 07:44:58 2015 UTC,the only issue i had was not con related but city related what was with the green line not running past 1 on Saturday night  we left the bars at around 1 30 and waited around till 2 40 and there was not a single green line heading back towards oldtown
comiccon,3d32ks,trogdor1234,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:37:12 2015 UTC,They didn't do 24 hours this year?

comiccon,3d32ks,Shavri,2,Tue Jul 14 00:17:20 2015 UTC,Only went Sunday and it was hell trying to maneuver around the crowds. And I was told that Friday & Saturday were actually less crowded which seems like a first. MY IDEA for Comic Con is too either increase the space between booths OR create street like patterns in the aisles that create 2 lanes and parking areas in front of booths to stop the constant clogging.
comiccon,3d32ks,whatmeworkquestion,4,Mon Jul 13 10:14:19 2015 UTC,I think it's because Sunday was worse on panels
comiccon,3d32ks,MsMargo,5,Mon Jul 13 11:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yah, no super-popular panels and no panels for the campers the next day means everyone floods the floor for shopping and swag.  I dunno, I was kind of happy to see the small press and artist alley tables getting SO much attention because the floor was so crowded."
comiccon,3d32ks,PrinceAuryn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:52:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed as far as the small press, artist alley, etc. traffic, but yeah, this past Sunday was by far the most crowded Sunday I've experienced at Comic-Con. Funny, because up until and through Saturday I was talking to my friends about how the crowds in general had been oddly manageable and not overwhelming."
comiccon,3d32ks,Hildaelisa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"And not only oddly crowded for a Sunday, the 5000s aisles were pretty O.K., but down by the 100s aisles it was madness."

comiccon,3d32ks,justakeiteasy,3,Mon Jul 13 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"I noticed that Hall H Saturday had real minimal questions as well, often 2-3 people and out. Which is fine for the most part as most comic-con questions (atleast to panels with actors) are real bad."

comiccon,3d3cxy,CitizenJaggers,8,Mon Jul 13 04:54:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Funko booth was a disaster area this year. My group tried Wed-Fri and eventually gave up. Maybe funko needs to go to a wrist band system like Hasbro, which has seemed to work out fairly well.  As far as the Pop Figures themselves go, I keep hearing people call them the next beanie babies, and honestly, it sounds like they really are. I have a couple myself, but only from stuff that I actually like (I'm trying to collect all the Adventure Time figures)."
comiccon,3d3cxy,atheistpiece,4,Mon Jul 13 05:06:15 2015 UTC,"This year?  It's a mess every year.  And at every convention their at, from what I've heard.  It's constantly capped, and never seems to open up.  I just don't understand it.  Eh.  If they end up as Beanie Babies, so be it.  My kids have a few, and they're happy, but I refuse to get anything but the ""regular"" ones.  I won't touch the exclusives, mostly because it's impossible to get them from Funko, and I won't pay $50+ for them.  Hell, I wouldn't even pay $15 for the Pink Batman that's out."
comiccon,3d3cxy,gotmaps,6,Mon Jul 13 06:05:23 2015 UTC,What's also sad is that there were so many people at the Conan show just for the funko. My friend said that they sat next to some guy who was on his DS during the entire show. Cast of GoT and walking dead show up? No reaction. Just rushed out as soon as they were passing out funkos

comiccon,3d3cxy,cleanscissors,2,Mon Jul 13 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As a collector, one of my favorite parts of Comic Con has always been the huge array of vendors selling different figures, etc. particularly the generally hard to find vintage stuff. Anymore, it's hard to even tell the booths apart because 75% of them are literally just Funko Pops. It's sort of insane."
comiccon,3d3cxy,whatmeworkquestion,3,Mon Jul 13 20:04:11 2015 UTC,The marketing this company has done is just insane. Aren't these just bobbleheads? Can't believe people are going so crazy for this fad.

comiccon,3d3cxy,rohay,5,Tue Jul 14 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"my girlfriend got basically beat up in the morning as those savages jumped on the 1 guy handing out tickets to the funko booth in the corner... 1 guy with zero help from any supporting staff... she said the pushing, shoving, and elbowing she got was worse then any concert she's ever been in... and all the while the fuck-you staff did nothing, and let a girl get beat up over toys.  Thanks funko, and fuck you too.    I blame myself because I've been able to get in there fairly easily the last few years and told her it was no big deal..."
comiccon,3d3cxy,jeffcrazy,2,Mon Jul 13 08:24:45 2015 UTC,3 years ago I was able to literally just walk up and grab a few things a friend asked me to pick up. Idk how or why it blew up these last 2 years
comiccon,3d3cxy,pornymcgee,2,Mon Jul 13 07:30:30 2015 UTC,"There was only one Funko booth? I went to Heroescon this year and they had like 5, tho some of them were part Funko, part other toys."

comiccon,3d3cxy,whatmeworkquestion,3,Mon Jul 13 12:50:33 2015 UTC,The Funko shop was seventh layer of hell-level bad this year. It made at least the surrounding few aisles practically unbearable in the process.

There was little to no line. I Camped a few shifts.  I got extremely lucky for Friday and Saturday panels by meeting the right people.

comiccon,3d0efs,spiderdan13,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:41:43 2015 UTC,Where do they get posted?
comiccon,3d0efs,Algernon8,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:39:03 2015 UTC,Just have to scour the web. Batman vs. Superman is already out there. Most of the panels can be found on YouTube and the suicide squad leaked trailer I found on brobible.com
comiccon,3d0efs,spiderdan13,26,Mon Jul 13 16:38:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually not a good thing in the long run.  If the movie studios see that comic-con can't be trusted to protect against footage leaks then there won't be any footage shown in the future.    This is all a big marketing campaign and if people leak it it screws up their plan potentially leading to money loss.   Think of it like this, if someone sees the footage and it is unfinished, they may thing poorly of the movie and never go see it.    Or maybe the studio wants to release it to the world as a huge campaign to draw more interest, well they can't do that now cause it's out and whatever other information they would have attached to the footage will be missed by those who have already seen it.   You don't have to agree with the points above because it is what the studios believe.   Worse of all, most of this is explained to those attendees who leak the footage."
comiccon,3d0efs,JDazzleGM,6,Sun Jul 12 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I didn't think much of the Batman vs. Superman movie before I saw the leaked trailer this weekend. I actually intend to see it now in theaters. I wasn't going to before this."
comiccon,3d0efs,darcerin,7,Mon Jul 13 02:09:19 2015 UTC,That trailer wasn't leaked; it was officially released alongside its reveal at Comic-Con.   Here is the link to the official trailer for those curious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y
comiccon,3d0efs,JDazzleGM,10,Mon Jul 13 03:33:28 2015 UTC,I'm sure they account for this happening though.
comiccon,3d0efs,mattbluesman,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe but why go through all the trouble to prevent it if they want it to leak? When Fox showed the new Deadpool trailer, they brought in a bunch of extra security into Hall H. Suicide Squad and X-Men Apocalypse represented only a few short weeks of filming. I doubt WB or FOX wanted a mass release of it."

comiccon,3d0efs,mattbluesman,0,Mon Jul 13 15:27:56 2015 UTC,"They may have contingency plans, but then some of those plans may be all the studio people wandering the panel room looking for those recording the footage"

comiccon,3d0efs,loco64,3,Sun Jul 12 18:15:19 2015 UTC,Please provide a better explanation so I may understand.
comiccon,3d0efs,JDazzleGM,3,Mon Jul 13 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"Well if I were in their position, I would want the leak to happen. I want information getting to people who are already excited about the product so that they can act as free advertisement to all the people who aren't as interested.  I suppose the idea is that the only people interested in the leak are probably already going to be customers. I'm more interested in people who aren't after the leak (people who might not be a customer, or are on the fence about it). So giving fanboys something to nag to all their non-fanboy counterparts is what I'm after."
comiccon,3d0efs,jdrawesome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Sure getting trailers out to the public and building hype is great IF it's meant for mass release. But you're missing the bigger picture and what the studios relationship to SDCC is.  Vendors promise exclusives to SDCC in exchange for a huge venue and big name event to promote their products. If everything leaks, it isn't exclusive to SDCC. Why would mega fans want to buy SDCC tickets if they can stay home and watch it online? If SDCC can't make money, there would be no venue for the studios to promote like this (sure they can promote on the internet but let's face it, its not a major events that happens every year that people pay attention to). It seems like a bad business move to leak something that was suppose to be mutually beneficial to you (studio) and your business partner (SDCC)."
comiccon,3d0efs,kwicked,2,Mon Jul 13 06:39:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think mega fans buy SDCC tickets for the exclusives. Plenty of smaller comic conventions don't get exclusives, or even have a very big celebrity list, but people still visit those.  SDCC gets quite a bit of traffic simply because it's one of the biggest conventions out there. People go to meet artists, actors, and writers. People go to cosplay and hang out with like minded people.  I think you're putting too much emphasis on exclusives as if it's the only reason for there to be a relationship between SDCC and the studio. I mean you said it yourself,   sure they can promote on the internet but let's face it, its not a major events that happens every year that people pay attention to   Even without exclusives studios would still go to SDCC to promote their product, and fans would still go to geek out, have fun, and maybe meet their idols."
comiccon,3d0efs,jdrawesome,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the long reply, I wanted to hit all the points:   I don't think mega fans buy SDCC tickets for the exclusives. Plenty of smaller comic conventions don't get exclusives, or even have a very big celebrity list, but people still visit those.   I think our definitions of mega fans differ here. I'm talking about the fan that NEEDS to see that new trailer or get the one of a kind toy. Yes, smaller conventions get people but not nearly as much. We are talking about mega fans specifically for major studios. Studios don't make exclusive trailers for Anime Expo, WonderCon, CTN, etc... also, those smaller conventions have nothing to leak.   I think you're putting too much emphasis on exclusives as if it's the only reason for there to be a relationship between SDCC and the studio.   I'm not saying its the only reason but it damn sure is an important one. If you ever attend SDCC, take a look at the lines for exclusives. Look at the lines for Hall H and Ballroom 20. Why does Hasbro get the longest lines vs the other booths? I'm not saying people don't go to the other things, but you can attend any con to cosplay and meet artist.   Take away the celebs, take away the exclusives, take away the Hall H and Ballroom 20 panels and really ask yourself if its worth a major studios time to promote there?    SDCC gets quite a bit of traffic simply because it's one of the biggest conventions out there.   There is a reason why it's the biggest. Ask yourself, what makes SDCC different from any other con. (hint: exclusives).    Even without exclusives studios would still go to SDCC to promote their product, and fans would still go to geek out, have fun, and maybe meet their idols.   So why not promote trailers at every con? Do you think Hall H/BR20 campers who flew to San Diego would still camp out to see a trailer they can watch on Youtube? Do you think people would still line up for Hasbro if all the same toys were available on Amazon? Wondercon 2014 had an estimate of 49,500 people. SDCC 2014 had an estimate of 130,000+ people. Do you think SDCC would have almost triple the numbers without the exclusives? Do you think studios would still want to fly their actors out, reserve their hotels, and pay for traveling for a third of the audience?  I also want to reiterate that I'm just addressing this statement:   Well if I were in their position, I would want the leak to happen.   I understand cons serve other purposes than exclusive things. I'm just giving a reason why major studios and sdcc as a business wouldn't want leaks to happen.   tl;dr: I'm just saying the reason they might not want leaks is because studios exclusive trailers attract the type of people who want to line up for Hall H/BR20. Hall H/BR20 makes a lot of money for SDCC. If the trailers are no longer exclusive, you risk losing the Hall H/BR20/exclusive craving customers.   Please if I'm wrong about exclusives, tell me why leaking trailers or just putting them up for all to see vs making them exclusive would be more beneficial to SDCC as a business."
comiccon,3d0efs,kwicked,2,Mon Jul 13 10:36:00 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying the reason they might not want leaks is because studios exclusive trailers attract the type of people who want to line up for Hall H/BR20.   I think this is making the assumption that the majority of people who line up or camp out are in it for the exclusives. I disagree as this conflicts with what my experiences are. Namely that me and everyone else camping out are excited for the actual panel. The chance to ask a question, to hear the celebs answer the questions, and partly to hear news.  As far as exclusives go... Well truthfully they're not worth it. The extra footage, the trailers, the insider information. It already leaks. It's already out there for consumers to look at. It has been this way for years. I haven't been able to attend SDCC in recent years, but I have still watched every interesting panel and seen every exclusive trailer that I've wanted to watch. So why is anyone still going?  Beyond all that I have a hard time with the idea that there are people out there who are salaried and work with marketing teams who are naive enough to think that at an event with 130k+ people in attendance that they can somehow keep their exclusives contained. Simply put, it's their job to understand that the footage will leak, that the information will spread, and to know it enough to make it useful for their product.  And I think it is the case that they do know and understand this. As I have mentioned before, the leaks and footage of the panels all exist on the internet. You can watch every last bit of SDCC on the internet with very little issue. So why has SDCC continually sold out?  The entire thing seems to be contradictory. People attend the event in large part due to the exclusives. The exclusives get leaked.   People still attend the event the following year."
comiccon,3d0efs,jdrawesome,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're talking about the same thing anymore.   Whether or not we feel something is worth it is irrelevant.   Whether or not things leak is not part of what I'm talking about.  I'm just stating why studios and sdcc would rather something not get leaked.   I'm saying there is no benefit to SDCC or major studios for release this type of stuff.  I'm just explaining why leaks might hurt SDCC.    You can watch every last bit of SDCC on the internet with very little issue.   This just isn't true. I saw a leaked Deadpool trailer that is missing a whole scene because someone had to hide their camera. Another leaked version where someone was sitting was in the back so the screen is tiny. The quality is usually awful for this leaked stuff. But imagine if someone is allowed to go in, record a high quality version every year and release it. The incentive to actually go to the panel would drop. And if you've actually been in one of the bigger halls, I can't see how you think getting a chance to ask questions is enough motivation to go, ESPECIALLY for the Saturday Hall H. They are usually so accelerated that maybe two or three people to get ask and sometimes no one in general because there are so many movies to cover in an one hour panel."
comiccon,3d0efs,kwicked,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think we value the same things either. If SDCC dropped all exclusives it sounds like you wouldn't go any longer and I'd still have a great time. Yes I've been to Hall H, camped out over night through rain. Being a fan of something, I think, is more than enough reason to want to go to these events. Exclusives are about as important to many of us as Q&A is to you.  As for the rest of this, my original post was an explanation about why they may want something to get leaked."
comiccon,3d0efs,jdrawesome,5,Mon Jul 13 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"Indeed. These are very savvy marketing and social media people, and they know exactly what will happen and exactly how much it will increase the hype."

I try my best to not scare him as the mask looks extremely real, but by going down on one knee and waving as nicely as I could, freaked him out so bad he screamed bloody murder and ran away as fast as he could... but towards the road right when a bus was leaving. I was too far away to do anything and I really thought that I was about to be responsible for a kid getting ran over, when his parents are able to grab his arm right when he was in mid step off the curb (whew).  Bet Moment:  I went to ballroom 20 on Sat morning bummed that no good panels outside of Hall H were scheduled for the day. I got there during the once upon a time panel, and had to wait outside for 20 minutes before it ended and I was let in. I was just going to chill there until the Simpsons panel (wasn't stoked about it but at least it was something to do). Before the Simpons however, there was the TV Guide Fan Choice panel. It doesn't say who is in it, and I just assumed it would be a bunch of authors/editors for the TV Guide. To my surprise and to everyone else based on their escatic shrills, out walks Maisie Williams (Arya - Game of Thrones), Norman Reedus (Daryl - The walking dead), David Anders (iZombie), Ming-Na Wen (Agents of shield),Eliza Taylor (Clarke - The 100), and Yvette Nicole brown (Community). It was amazing!!!! :-D"
comiccon,3d35hq,bilago,11,Mon Jul 13 10:16:03 2015 UTC,"I was surprised by how rude some of the Funko employees were as well as how unorganized it all was. It went from no tickets being issued for purchases for Thursday and Friday, to tickets being issued Saturday when they realized it was turning into a shitstorm. Then Sunday it went from one employee saying they didn't issue tickets but to check back around lunch time. When I did return around lunch time another employee said they did issue tickets and there were out but if I really wanted something I should check eBay. Needless to say, not a great time there.  For me the highlights were the panels, especially The Oatmeal. For as small as it was, it was super fun and laid back :)"
comiccon,3d35hq,TheAndroidsConundrum,3,Mon Jul 13 04:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seemed like the Funko people had no clue on what to do. Until the funko bubble bursts (a la beanie babies), they really need to move to a wrist band system like Hasbro. That or CCI needs to give them a different booth space so they have manage their line a little better."
comiccon,3d35hq,atheistpiece,2,Mon Jul 13 05:19:23 2015 UTC,Pretty much! Although I'm surprised it took them two (technically 3 if you count preview) full days AND people getting hurt before someone suggested a ticket system. Hopefully they'll keep that in place and have better communication amongst their employees. One thing is the line managers not knowing wtf is going on and another is booth staff members not knowing their ass from a hole in the ground.
comiccon,3d35hq,TheAndroidsConundrum,2,Mon Jul 13 05:54:46 2015 UTC,Didn't help they didn't want to explain the ticket system at all and got all butt hurt when people asked. They really need to rethink their booth system more or just move to what Hasbro and the others do.
comiccon,3d35hq,FKRMunkiBoi,4,Mon Jul 13 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Fuck those jerks at Funko and Super7.  They are to collectibles what gimmick-covers were to comics back in the 90's. They spam the market with so much ""exclusive"" crap and act like they are the reason people go to SDCC just for them.  Their manufactured ""rarity"" just feeds the flipper mentality. It wouldn't be so bad but seriously, count how many SDCC exclusives they bring compared to other retailers. They literally flood the market."
comiccon,3d35hq,jhov85,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"i understand funko, but what issues did you run into at super7? I got everything I wanted from them at the convention and at skeletors layer and it was all relatively easy to do"
comiccon,3d35hq,atheistpiece,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:56:49 2015 UTC,Actually I got the same confusion. The ticket thing I was scratching my head at since it randomly appeared and didn't really understand how that was working.
comiccon,3d35hq,TranQLizer,5,Mon Jul 13 05:07:29 2015 UTC,"My favorite part was that basically the whole iZombie cast were staying in the same hotel as me, so I got to ride up and down the elevators and order beers and cocktails at the hotel bar surrounded by them. I also took a piss with Tom Ellis (Lucifer himself) pissing into the urinal next to me.  The worst part was that whole Funko corner. After I had given up on ever getting a Funko figure (I wanted bender), there were other things in that area that I wanted to look at, and it was a complete nightmare trying to get to them.  This year was a better year for me though. I worked together with some other friends and managed to get some of the hasbro stuff that I wanted because a friend of a friend managed to secure a spot. It goes against conventional wisdom, but my girl and I basically did all our shopping on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Because of that, we were able to really enjoy the other stuff on Saturday and Today. We got to do the Ash vs the Evil dead trailer thing, the walking dead walk through thing inside the hall. We chatted with the last ship guys for a little and they hooked my girlfriend up with an extra teen wolf tripod stool they had just because we were friendly and treating them like people. My niece got to do the adult swim stuff, etc. Basically, when most people are at their most stressed during the convention, my group was at our most relaxed point. It was nice. We probably spent 10% more by shopping first, but it was worth it."
comiccon,3d35hq,N7_Whovian,3,Mon Jul 13 05:16:07 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I'm not really interested in Funko, but as a Futurama fan, I hope you found a Bender Funko figure. It's probably not the only figure you were looking for in the Funko area, but I saw many Benders throughout various booths in the exhibition hall. I even saw a 'Glorious Golden' Bender Funko that I assume is somewhat hard to find because they were averaging around $50."
comiccon,3d35hq,N3rdLink,3,Mon Jul 13 06:27:06 2015 UTC,"I believe Hot Topic is sellng the Bender exclusive in store and online. It may not have the ""Comic Con exclusive sticker on it but it has like a Funko Summer conventions sticker on it."
comiccon,3d35hq,cleanscissors,6,Mon Jul 13 13:16:56 2015 UTC,"Lowlight for me was waiting for the Marvel booth on Preview night. Once the doors opened I went straight to the booth and the line was capped. 5 mins later it opened up and I got in at 5:45p. So I waited and waited and waited. One of the workers assured me that we wouldn't be in line if they didn't think we would be able to get through before preview night ended.   The main worker (bald guy) who was running the line, finally came out at 8:15p and said ""I've been running this line for years and I guarantee you won't be able to get through.""  I then said ""No offense, if you have been running this line for years how come you let us stay in line for this long?"" His response was ""You need to get in line first thing."" (Which I explained that I'd been in line for about 3 hours and he was a little speechless) and remarked ""Welcome to Comic Con"".   TLDR: I wasted all of preview night waiting in the marvel line because the person running the line was terrible at managing it."

All I ask is to tell me the truth so I don't waste the whole night waiting in line.   I did end up getting the Scottie young pins I wanted on Saturday besides the vision pin which I think sold out on Friday.

comiccon,3d35hq,serenduckity,2,Mon Jul 13 18:58:02 2015 UTC,"Hehe there wasn't any actual tally, it was more a win/lose every time someone came in, so a lot of wins and probably an even number of losses. I attribute most of our losses to an uneven number of girls in the other booth drawing the attention of most of the male con-goers ;)"
comiccon,3d35hq,jensyth,2,Mon Jul 13 23:28:39 2015 UTC,As a girl I ran to another girl because they were louder. Haha I ran in a circle as soon as the yelling started.
comiccon,3d35hq,summerhop,2,Tue Jul 14 13:15:53 2015 UTC,"Haha I got into a 'discussion' with a woman because she said she went to the girls booth strictly because women needed to be on top now and that men have been on top long enough. Haha I got out of that conversation quickly afterwards :)  But yeah, that seemed to be a common response as well. Once people realized it was a competition and that we were basically giving away the identical things, they would zigzag between the booths, fake us out, etc. I can only hope future volunteer shifts will be as fun"

His ship out date got moved up, and so he couldn't come with me like we planned.  Worst Moment: A big name writer I've known and supported since before his first book came out snubbed me when I asked him for a note for my son in boot camp. Son is a big fan of one of the author's series."
comiccon,3d35hq,mgallowglas,2,Mon Jul 13 17:14:44 2015 UTC,"That sucks.  :(  I met a comic writer who said online that he welcomes everyone to stop by and say hi.  Even said he doesn't charge for the first autograph.  So, I stopped by shook his hand and he was pretty dismissive.  I told him I enjoyed his work, but he didnt ask what I enjoyed, or try to engage me in anything.  I was there for maybe 60 seconds, and he was busy trying to sell autographed scripts anytime anyone walked up.  Oh well, to each his own."
comiccon,3d35hq,mgallowglas,2,Mon Jul 13 21:41:24 2015 UTC,"Meh. In the grand scheme, it's more disappointing that anything else, and getting a note for my boy from Felicia Day more than made up for it. The difference between them also taught me a lot on what kind of ""celebrity"" I want to be if my books ever take off. I know Miss Day catches a lot of flack from a lot of people, and she doesn't know me from anyone, but she was polite, sweet, and gave a stranger a few moments of her time to help make a recruit in our armed forces very happy during boot camp. If I ever make it big, I want to be that kind of guy."
comiccon,3d35hq,famoustran,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:20 2015 UTC,The artist thing really sucks. I met several celebrities that were very cool to me this weekend. A couple who my son likes were charging for autographs didn't charge me to write a note to my son. Some people are cool. Some aren't.
comiccon,3d35hq,Nyareth,4,Mon Jul 13 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"First year going as a general con-goer (was volunteering a few years back). Went all four days and wow I miss it so much. Just going to mention the best moments heh.  Went for the pictures/memories with friends and I had a bunch of those. Went to the Conan show on Thursday (was great but if you have a badge, I'd suggest going to the con instead...this took up a lot of time that day).   Met Brandon Sanderson on Friday...showed up early to his book signing so he brought everyone over to the side wall and just told us stories and answered questions (and got books signed/pictures of course!).   Dressed up as X/Y Pokemon Trainer and Jedi Link :d Saturday/Sunday. A lot of people liked the Jedi Link and it was fun to cosplay as well.  Had a blast exploring the downtown San Diego area at night. Hit up some bars/restaurants...great food, good times.  Some of my favorite booths were the Walking Dead booth (always a great photo opportunity), the WETA worshop, the YuGiOh card booth, the Sideshow displays (their Court of the Dead work was really awesome).   I didn't go to a lot of panels, but my favorite one had to be Sci-Fi vs. Fantasy authors Family Feud (w/ Sanderson, Rothfuss, etc.)  Went to Saturday nerdist podcast feat. Guillermo Del Toro, Tom Hiddleston, and Maisie Williams. Maisie and Del Toro were really funny haha  Overall that was one of the most complete con experiences I have ever had. Would love to go again next year :)!"

I felt like I was just going through the motions.  I keep going though, partly because I'm afraid if I don't go at least one day, I'm going to lose out on that extra chance to get tickets for next year, and I'll be really bummed.  I also hit Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim (all 4 days), so I felt like I had con fatigue before the con had even started.  I have a 3 1/2 year old boy, and a 7 1/2 year old girl.  I got tickets for Thursday, Friday, and Sunday.  I brought the boy on Thursday.  Came by myself on Friday, and brought the girl on Sunday.  The lowlights - I lost my Thursday badge somewhere in the Gaslamp during lunch.  Probably during one of the many times I took my son off my shoulders.  Fortunately, we had spent a couple hours inside, and there's enough to do outside, that we still had a great time.  The highlights - just hanging out with my kids.  Spent at least an hour with each of them at LEGO, just building stuff.  Walked around and got pictures (Doctor Who booth and DC Comics).  Found Funko's that they wanted, found a couple of DC Showcase trades at 50% off to get them going on reading comics (yay for Silver Age Superman and Supergirl).  I didn't even stress or bother trying to get exclusives (would have loved the LEGO sets).  So everything was pretty chill for me.  Enjoyed going to some of the booths at the end of the day to find short lines and stuff I wanted to buy in stock (a Doctor Who calendar at BBC America and a couple of My Little Pony toys at Entertainment Earth).  I enjoyed walking up to the registers and not even waiting in line.  I was honestly ready to ditch next year, or only go for one day, but after this weekend, I've decided to hit the con like this again next year."
comiccon,3d35hq,litex2x,4,Mon Jul 13 06:16:57 2015 UTC,Best moment is definitely when JJ Abrams invited everybody in Hall H to a Star Wars concert.

Highlight was, even with the 4 hour wait was the Vikings blood splater https://youtu.be/3If2lpqVeUo video, that plus the plastic Vikings beer horn totally made it worth it.

comiccon,3d2r8u,Hildaelisa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:11:24 2015 UTC,It wasn't too bad. The 2 AM one was the worst but ultimately survivable. The panel I wanted to see most was the Marvel TV one and could have gone if I went in line several hours before instead of 10 minutes for ballroom 20. Rookie move.   Got to go to two panels today and check out the Lego Dimensions event at the Hard Rock. It was fun and I got a free shirt.
comiccon,3d2r8u,kysoft,2,Mon Jul 13 06:41:24 2015 UTC,Didn't try to hard getting swag from comic-con this year (aside from looking up twitter once in awhile) but happened to stumble upon the Bat-man VS Supes shirt while walking around Gaslamp. All you had to do is do a tweet. Also Hasbro was giving out some amazing swag. No one knew cuz the side door to the swag area in the booth was very discrete. Got the Jurassic World iPhone case with no wait and right after they started handing out Ant-Man shirts. So Awesome. Follow em on twitter next year for free swag posts. @hasbro http://imgur.com/z9soI3u

comiccon,3d2r8u,batRam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:12:29 2015 UTC,How did you know about it?  My friends and I sadly didn't find out about it until after it was over.
comiccon,3d2r8u,ingloriousmanterds,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well it was Thurs, Fri and Sat. And I was walking by down 5th and saw the lanterns, but also one of the guys from the Frieza Forze boot camp told me about it"
comiccon,3d2r8u,batRam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:56:46 2015 UTC,Maaan.  We found out about it on Sunday.  Guess we'll have to keep our eyes peeled more next year.
comiccon,3d2r8u,ghost661,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:17:26 2015 UTC,Well the party was to promote the new movie... I hope there is more DBZ stuff next year :D

comiccon,3d2r8u,whatisburnnotice,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:28:14 2015 UTC,I think there were 8 different posters.  I have one with Samuel L. Jackson and one with Kurt Russell
comiccon,3d2r8u,8bitesq,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"Things I bought:    Magic Planeswalkers Set Golden Frieza Funko Pop Metallic Vegeta Funko Pop White Ranger Tokyo Vinyl Marvel Pins - The Spider-Man Characters Ant-Man Collectors Corps Box I had an artist named Mike Vasquez who specializes in Adventure Time draw me a Spider-Man 2099 for me. Which came out really cool! A very talented guy.    As far as free stuff:    The Hey Arnold Bag (Which I really love) A cool patch that's associated with the a book coming out called ""Armada"" I got a MegaBloks Minion from Despicable Me I got a Machinima shirt from the xbox lounge that had a huge hole in the center, kind of upsetting but oh well, it was free. A Lando comic and secret wars poster from Marvel. A Hot Wheels lanyard that I used the whole weekend, as well as a ""PBS Nerd"" pin that I thought was neat. Hateful Eight Poster and one of those google cardboard VR things from Legendary And plenty of other booklets and what not   As far as things go I'm super excited I was able to get everything I wanted!   My two biggest let downs were being unable to by the Batman VS Superman Funko Pops, and also being unaware that people got Funko Pops from Conan! Those looked so cool! I'm happy others were able to get them though."
