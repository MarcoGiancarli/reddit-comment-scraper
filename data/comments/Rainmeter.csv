Rainmeter,3e3soq,Ozymandias7388,3,Tue Jul 21 19:06:13 2015 UTC,"Edit: I should probably explain that this skin is based off the popular triangles skin (linked below). It's rebuilt from the ground up however to populate the list automatically with your 5 most recently played steam games and download the wallpapers for them automatically! So even if you install a new game no reconfiguration just wait a minute at most for it to sort itself out.  Here's the skin: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzePDiqZASV4YjgxMXctUVpzdkE/view?usp=sharing  All you should have to do is alter the URL to include your steam ID (It's currently set to mine):   [Variables]   URL=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ozymandias88/games?tab=recent     (Replace Ozymandias88 with your steam ID)     There's a little bit of lag in the loading sometimes as it googles the games and downloads their wallpaper.     Things used for inspiration and the other skins in the gif: My main inspiration Triangles: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/34g31y/triangles/ (The credits for triangles): https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/34g31y/triangles/cquam97     Steam mini launcher: http://rainmeterhub.com/skins/mini-steam-launcher/     Fountain of Colours (Equalizer):  http://alatsombath.deviantart.com/art/Fountain-of-Colors-Music-Visualizer-Rainmeter-518894563     And i think that should be everything, Enjoy!"

Rainmeter,3e3soq,jmac1239,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:08 2015 UTC,I did see the comment with the download link. Note that mine automatically updates based on your most recently played steam games which I don't think has been done before.  It also handles the wallpaper slightly differently (masking) and automatically downloads the wallpaper from Google based off the name of the games

So I couldn't find out how to let everyone download it all, So I made pastebins for all the code I changed. So delete the code that was in that file and replace it with this code.  Step 1. How I did this is I have one fountain of color visualizers open and a monstercat visualizers open to use as a player, One I use as a player(The top left) the second I use as the actual visualizer. For the player (top left) change the monstercat spotify.ini file to this, http://pastebin.com/njV6jzqG. Then Change the Variables.ini file to this, http://pastebin.com/QVRJesCi .  Now for the actual Visualizer you need to change the variables.ini file on fountain of colors to this, http://pastebin.com/6hfwwump  Now For the overlay your going to need to watch this tutorial to understand how it works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IjPDMWezg  Here is all of the Download links for all the skins I used.  Fountain of Color: The visualizer I used.  Simple Media: The Clock used on the right. http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Simple-Media-1-1-212678796  Monstercat Visualizer: This was the visualizer that I used to make it come out of the gun. Had to do a vast amount of coding to resize it and position it to the area I wanted. The player was also used with this monstercat visualzer, I just changed the variables sensitivity to 0 so I could just use it as a player. http://marcopixel.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Visualizer-for-Rainmeter-1-2-1-486330771  For my background and the outline I made: http://imgur.com/a/BYrd3  Hopefully I provided you guys with enough for you to do it on your own. Tell me any problems and I will try to change my instructions to make it work for you. I would love to see screenshots of your screens to know it worked for you. UPVOTE THIS SO OTHERS CAN SEE!"

So without further ado, my setup uses the following:  The Wallpaper along with the cut I usedto cover part of the visualizer. And so...  VisBubble is the visualizer behind the water lily.  Desktop VU Meter and La Compagnie Music Player in the bottom right along with this Spotify Plugin. This is also in my last setup. I really like it. You should, too.  La Compagnie Clock. We all like it. Lot of us use it. Same with Honeycomb Launcher. Neat. I also used /u/sharklepower's wonderful icon set to match the theme. Big shoutout to him.   Large Clean Weather with Plain Weather Icons (The white ones)  Ok guys, real talk. The teamspeak plugin actually isn't finished yet. I still have to make a few changes to the .ini and do a little documentation to not only make it mine but to also make it user friendly and easy to set up so all you have to do is put in your server ip and get cracking. I've made it comepletely from scratch and am very satisfied with how it's coming along so I really want it to be absolutely complete when I share it.

Just because you haven't cluttered your desktop with icons and are using a flat(ish) color wallpaper doesn't automatically make it minimal.

Any reason for that?"

I've had issues if the folder containing the files is more than one folder deep, which can happen a lot accidentally if the archive already contains a folder. Make sure your folder structure is set up like this:  Documents\Rainmeter\SkinName\skinfiles.stuff  instead of  Documents\Rainmeter\Skinname\Skinname\skinfiles.stuff  Also if the folder has certain characters in it (like @), it won't show up in Rainmeter, so check for that."

Rainmeter,3devnp,mr4ffe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Rule #2:   THINK OF A CREATIVE TITLE THAT ACCURATELY DESCRIBES YOUR SETUP. POSTS TITLED ONLY WITH WORDS SUCH AS ""FIRST POST, SIMPLE, MINIMAL, OR NEW SETUP"" WILL BE DELETED   Thank the mods your post has been saved. They've been lax as of late. In addition, it's sort of a stigma around here that Honeycomb is entirely overused, and the background visualizer is little more than a cliche. The banner has a nice style, and the Computer Info widgets go with it pretty well, but other than that it's sort of just a disparate, mish-mash design.   So what I'd recommend is that you take that theme, PC Master Race in this case, and run with it. Do a bit of research. See if you can find a new wallpaper that's perhaps a bit more fitting of the banner and the words on it. Like a PC game. Witcher 3, maybe? As opposed to some random mountains, take a screenshot from within one of your favourite/prettiest PC games, and do something with that.  I love Rainmeter. It's got so much potential. But much of that potential is left untapped and rather wasted by people who don't ever bother trying to dive a little bit deeper into the code and nuance of Rainmeter's design.  The Rainmeter website has loads of helpful guides and tips. The link to this and a bunch of other helpful sites are all on this sub's sidebar. I wish more people would look over there. sigh"

Rainmeter,3djetp,Skitsofrantik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Try doing the following, everytime I've run into this problem on other peoples computers it has always been because one of these reasons.  Windows - Taskbar Has Disappeared from the Desktop  This page explains how to get the taskbar to reappear.  Symptom  You cannot see the taskbar (which contains the ""Start"" button) anywhere on your desktop. Causes  The taskbar may be hiding at the bottom of the screen after being accidentally resized.  If the presentation display was changed, the taskbar may have moved off of the visible screen (Windows 7 and Vista only).  The taskbar may be set to ""Auto-hide"" (Windows XP with Service Pack 2 only).  The 'explorer.exe' process may have crashed. Solutions  Put the mouse pointer on the bottom border of your screen.  If the pointer turns into a double-arrow (double Arrow Pointing up and down), click and drag upwards. If your taskbar isn't hiding at the bottom of the screen, try moving the mouse to the right, left, and top edges, looking for the double-arrow.  Press the Windows logo key and the P key on your keyboard to bring up the presentation display mode options.  Make sure ""Computer Only"" is selected. Use the arrow keys to toggle between options and Enter to select the correct display mode.  Press the Windows key on the keyboard to bring up the Start Menu  Right-Click on the taskbar and select Properties. Toggle the 'Auto-Hide the taskbar' checkbox and click Apply. If it is now checked, move the cursor to the bottom, right, left, or top of the screen and the taskbar should re-appear. Repeat step three to return to your original setting.  Open the Task Manager using either Ctrl+Alt+Del or Ctrl+Shift+Esc.  Click the File menu and select New Task. In the dialog box, type 'explorer.exe' to restart the process."

Much of it was made by looking at code for other skins and taking pieces here and there.   For System Info, Disk Info, Recycling Bin, and Network Info skins I mainly used illustro with quite a few changes to size, style, and other things.   The visualizer was mostly Desktop++'s code with some choice changes to make it fit into that box (which I thought turned out nicely).   The weather skin was mostly Do I Need A Jacket and Electric Spaces (the WebParser was giving me some troubles so I compared and copied from both).   The flashing triangle was quite custom. To make it, I had to make it in After Effects, make it a gif in Photoshop, remove the background with ImageMagick, and separate the frames with ffmpeg. Took forever to get it running smoothly.   I borrowed the grid/border from a project of /u/FancyPansy's posted on /r/PersonOfInterest and made it into an image over the whole screen.   The white bar is also a Rainmeter skin. It is just a white bar made in Illustrator.  The clock is a modified 1-Line Clock.  The font used was Apple ][.    Why did I make this? As I was watch an episode of Person of Interest the other day, I thought that the UI to the malevolent AI would make a fantastic Rainmeter skin. Later that day, I saw the aforementioned post on the Person of Interest subreddit and decided that I would make a simple theme. It quickly spiraled into a much more complex theme as I discovered what I could do with some time.  Yes, it is very resource heavy. I am working on reducing its load, but my PC can handle it rather well at the present."

Rainmeter,3daaqi,WaterlooTF,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:51:14 2015 UTC,Im feeling some circle icons acting as more planets. Keep in mind that the planets have outer glow so if you add icons planets you'll need to add outer glow as well for them to blend in.  or you could just put 40% transparent icons over the current planets that fade in on mouse over.  Then maybe an equalizer in the comet tail because I know that's the trend.  EDIT: also what would be really cool is if you used a .png to make a shifted circular icon to go over the planet that is distorted

Rainmeter,3d4r9s,EzrealBra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:37 2015 UTC,"They mean floating, as in being an inch off the bottom of the screen. Both Rocket Dock and ObjectDock have a setting where you can fine-tune the position using X and Y offsets. If you want it to hover inches from the bottom/top/sides, you can, if you want it touching the bottom of the screen, it's all a setting away."
Rainmeter,3d4r9s,Venrexx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:38:42 2015 UTC,Anyway to make Droptop extend to my second monitor?
Rainmeter,3d4r9s,EzrealBra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"Best way would probably to edit the .ini so that it's width value is the same as the accumulated lengths of both your screens.  eg, if one screen is 1920x1080 and you have 2 screens then you would set the width value like so  W=3840  Keep in mind that depending on how it is set up, you may need to set other values for icon locations manually as well, which shouldn't be an issue so long as they set it all up properly to begin with."

Rainmeter,3d4r9s,virginityrocks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:53:27 2015 UTC,"I just took a look at Droptop and you can edit the Width of the bar, but it seems it will take a lot of work as they never added in any dual-screen support. You will need to go into every .ini and individually test the width of each and every meter to make sure they all line up and work properly, which will take quite a lot of time unfortunately.  Edit: Spelling"
Rainmeter,3d4r9s,EzrealBra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"Seeing as I made the damn thing... Extending it onto more than one monitor was never implemented. I didn't actually think anyone would actually want to do that. There is, however, a built-in UI for moving Droptop to another monitor under 'Settings >> Other Settings >> Move Droptop to another monitor'.  Now if you want to extend it over two monitors... I'll see what I can do, though I don't have two monitors at hand to test it. If you were looking for the values, it would be the W value under [TopBar] in DropdownBar.ini.

You will need MSIAfterburner to use them as is, but most people use different temp monitors. Just swap out the measures. You can effectively use these skins with any measure. The two round line graphs simply updated every couple of seconds and draw the current value of the measure at that point in the circle. The five point star thingy can accept any five measures to display. If you mouse over and of these skins they will display labels with their current and max values. There is a lua script measure that holds max values- feel free to use it with any other measure! Just pass in the measure name you want to track.  I am submitting these as is, though they could all use some work. Personally, I am satisfied with the CPU and GPU monitors, but I would love to see someone else do something more exciting with them.

Rainmeter,3cyle7,ChanceMorrisBuddyCop,8,Sat Jul 11 23:23:11 2015 UTC,How is Win10? Is it better than Win7 in your opinion?
Rainmeter,3cyle7,fingermebooty,11,Sun Jul 12 01:18:11 2015 UTC,To me I feel that the performance and function is much better in 10 and even somewhat in 8.1.   What Windows 10 really is missing right now is the option to optimise windows and layouts to your own liking.... And a much needed revamp of the Explorer would be nice but otherwise I would recommend it.
Rainmeter,3cyle7,TheOtherMark,3,Sun Jul 12 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""optimise windows and layouts to your own liking?"""
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Nephilyn,4,Sun Jul 12 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think he means little things like this thread for example. The default white title bars arent at the moment user customizeble (sort of, apparently it can be remedied with an XML file.) There is also complaints about a 1px border around windows. Just little things here and there that will hopefully be at least looked at by the official release soon."
Rainmeter,3cyle7,SixEightPee,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:53 2015 UTC,Why do some people have it all ready and others don't? Is it like and early release test or something?
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Nephilyn,6,Sun Jul 12 02:36:03 2015 UTC,The most recent ones are called insider previews. You can opt into trying it out. I wouldn't recommend it as there are still some bugs and kinks to work out depending on your platform. Official release is only like 2 weeks away though.
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Klutztheduck,2,Sun Jul 12 02:44:25 2015 UTC,I have it on a 7 yr old laptop and the only issue I have is drivers for my wireless n card inside. I have to disable and enable the adapter for it to connect. Other than that bug (which is pretty big to me)  the os seems really smooth and a decent improvement. Just needs driver support.
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Nephilyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:53:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's not stable or anything. It's also not very polished, like you said drivers and there's small things here and there. Like I said it depends on your platform. I'm running the lastest build on my Surface Pro 3 and I spent time setting it all up, but I think I'm going roll back to 8.1 and give it some time. I will need to heavily rely on it for school soon so I want that stability and system I already know. I think 8.1 fits the Surface better and 10 compromises even in tablet mode."
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Klutztheduck,2,Sun Jul 12 04:09:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I know what you mean and agree 8.1 is your best option.   I threw it on an old laptop I had sitting around doing nothing just to check it out. My desktop is 8.1. The laptop is used for just Microsoft Word documents and surfing the web so I didn't see the harm. It was just an old dell vostro I got when I was in college. I would give it  a few months. Hopefully Microsoft updates legacy drivers. My laptop was fine on 8 but 8.1 has the same network card issues that 10 has for me.
Rainmeter,3cyle7,Nephilyn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my desktop is on 8.1 and although I ""reserved"" my copy of 10 I don't think I'm that comfortable upgrading my main pc really. I think the desktop version will be great soon enough though. I'm usually all about the newest and latest tech, I shouldn't let the hybrid system I'm using taint the main experience."
Rainmeter,3cyle7,LunarisDream,2,Sun Jul 12 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"Yep. I used my good judgement to install it alongside my Win8.1 installation instead of over it. It was really neat, but buggy as heck, and installing it removed my dual boot capability - I could no longer boot to 8.1. Had to get a third party software to reinstall it.  There are a list of issues that have been reported for Win10's technical preview, but a lot of them that I've seen have not yet been addressed, and they kill the experience for me."

Rainmeter,3cwcrx,krnsam98,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:36 2015 UTC,I just searched up high res league of legends wall papers. Its hard to find good ones that work well for rainmeter.
Rainmeter,3cwcrx,junkies_bastard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:58 2015 UTC,How did you separate the visualizer and the controls for the Monstercat Visualizer skin? Awesome desktop btw
Rainmeter,3cwcrx,WowZaPowah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:32:35 2015 UTC,You need to make two of the same folder and use this code on the one that you want to have just the player. Replace spotify.ini with this. http://pastebin.com/NWzi8JiT
Rainmeter,3cwcrx,Samster49,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:10:29 2015 UTC,How do you remove the player from the existing visualizer once you have done this?

Rainmeter,3cyhap,yaseenmust,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:49:24 2015 UTC,You might have to cut the bottom off your image so that there's room for the taskbar. It's hard for me to tell if it's overlapping at all though.

Rainmeter,3ctfak,Mehta23,3,Fri Jul 10 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"Its suprisingly simple actually, basically you have your overlay as a PNG and you need like six lines of code:     [Rainmeter] Update=1000    [ReWall]  Meter=Image  ImageName=overlay.png   W=1920    H=1080    Tile=0  PreserverAspectRatio=0     Save this as a .ini file and make a folder with your overlay included, place this folder in your rainmeter ""skins"" folder, refresh and it should appear!

Rainmeter,3cwfkq,MUSE_iC,2,Sat Jul 11 10:18:56 2015 UTC,Why don't you set it via Windows Settings?
Rainmeter,3cwfkq,dr_piss,3,Sat Jul 11 15:11:09 2015 UTC,Problem with that would be it would change every hour not change at the time. So per say you had a sun moving across screen and you turn pc on at 6:23 am it would start with 0.png not 6.png and would change on the 23 not on the hour so at 7:23 1.png will be background.
Rainmeter,3cwfkq,mikecraft900,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:16:36 2015 UTC,Yup thats exactly the problem with that option.
Rainmeter,3cwfkq,theGracket,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"Update the entire thing less often in the [Rainmeter] section or use an UpdateDivider=X inside of measures so that those measures only update every X updates of the entire thing. Also, you might want to set an if condition so a wallpaper is only loaded if the wallpaper would change, which will stop it from blinking every update. You would probably do this using IfActions and !SetVariable. Rainmeter.net has pretty good documentation if you want to learn all of this: http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/measures/general-options/ifactions"

Rainmeter,3cop1h,bcgoss,5,Thu Jul 9 23:39:37 2015 UTC,"You can make a meter from scratch that does a lot of things. The best place to start is thinking about how you use your computer. Then make rainmeter skins that do some of that work for you. For example, I work with Java, so I need to open a text editor, a command line and a PuTTY session to my webserver. I wrote a batch file and a skin that open all of these with one click."

Rainmeter,3cop1h,LurkingUnicorn,26,Fri Jul 10 05:51:19 2015 UTC,It will all be over soon enough. Someone posted their rainmeter background in the CSGO sub and I would venture to guess r/rainmeter got subsequently slammed with new subs directly from CSGO. I made one myself (didn't post it) and subbed here. I had no idea rainmeter was even a thing.   You could probably go get a bunch of new subs here if you did the same thing somewhere else. Someone post a DOTA2 themed rainmeter over in r/dota2 and watch the DOTA2 posts come flooding in. Apply that concept to any sub with strong computer oriented fan bases and I bet people will be coming here to see what it's all about.  I would be interested to see stats on the subscriber count of r/rainmeter before and after the first CSGO theme was posted.  But I do agree. Maybe make a thread theme and let people post comments of their similar theme in one thread. Sorry you guys got flooded with CSGO content. The newness will wear off soon enough.
Rainmeter,3cop1h,TheIceRange,9,Thu Jul 9 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"This is exactly right, I just wanted to show rainmeter to another community that probably hasn't seen rainmeter.

If it gets popular, there a new flood a comin. So be like Noah and take the boat out of here."

Rainmeter,3cop1h,UltraRageShadow,3,Thu Jul 9 19:10:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. There is a s#itload of honeycomb, but I wouldn't agree that there is only CS:GO themes or that they are way too present. Yes, there has been recent successful posts that are based around the theme of CS:GO but overwhelming to the point of upsetting? I, personally don't know about that.   The idea of a ""No Honeycomb"" or ""No XXXXX"" theme week has been thought of before and unfortunately, we, as mods, would have no way of making sure that none of the ""banned"" skins are used aside from approving every single post manually. We really have three active moderators and making sure that every post gets pushed through would be a pain in the a$$ if you account for all of the posts that we handle on a certain week.  For your contest ideas, I would be all for it. I was originally brought on to continue what we had as Theme of the Month or TotM for short, but after 3-4 attempts to revitalize it, nothing or frutition came about. You might remember very recently when the sub was trending that we posted a contest and stickied it for the better part of a week or so, and we only had a handful of submissions. Nobody would love to bring back contests or theme weeks more than me but if there is no user involvement, what's the point?  One thing I can really get behind would be doing a weekly skin showcase. I am going to message the rest of the mods about that right now and see what their opinions are on it and the potential of making something like that happening.   Finally, thank you for your ideas and please, anybody reading this feel free to respond or message myself or any of the other mods regarding any ideas you might have about the sub or anything that you think we should hear.  ~RickeyB"
Rainmeter,3cop1h,GlassBoddle,2,Thu Jul 9 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering here /u/RickeyB.   First, was not thinking about a ""No-XXXXX"" week/""contest-ish"" week as an autoban to the posts, but more like a trend to follow. Just to make people realize they can do neat and sweet things without the super common skins.   I was supa dupa hyped up when I saw you guys trying to bring back the TotM contest, even did something for the music themed one. Sadly, I feel like most rainmeter-ers right now are newcomers. Hence they just post their first setup and that's about it. Not that many people - that's my point of view though - stay here as long as we do, some OC'ers are there and post really good things, and I feel they should be shown as examples. OC'ing is, to me, a good thing.   I'm going really far, am I not?  Anyway, cheers for following my ideas, I look forward to seeing a stickied post back in r/rainmeter! :D"
Rainmeter,3cop1h,bcgoss,5,Thu Jul 9 21:58:02 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the csgo, but I agree with you on everything else.  90% of the posts here are a few overused skins that don't really go well with the background, but it still gets tons of upvotes.  Why?  Because  people like the background.  I get kind of sad when I see somebody make their own skin or are actually creative and get no attention compared to the pretty wallpaper with one skin."
Rainmeter,3cop1h,floodimoo123,4,Thu Jul 9 18:28:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Not that HoneyComb looks bad, it's actually really colorful and joyful, but god that is HARD to make it fit a wallpaper. It always looks like its coming out of nowhere.   Some make an effort and some just don't give a damn about it - go ahead, whatever floats your boat. But I'd love to see more people trying to care and make good looking things. Even if they use overused skins, at least try to make them go well with each other and your wallpaper."

The ""3d backgrounds"" was a cool phase, very creative for someone to think of that.   I think the biggest problem is that people just don't do much with computers any more. Mostly they just use a browser for everything. If you have an icon that launches Chrome, what else do you need?"

I'm a newer user of rainmeter, and I subbed here so I can see creativity (not that anyone's CS:GO themes aren't creative, just a little stale) and be inspired by posts on how to make my theme.

And less than a day later I tried having a Majora's Mask theme and actually got a functional ""inventory""-prototype :D  And this was only the beginning.  Then I went to this sub here more and more and I, too, found that most of these, on the first glance awesome-looking themes were just one googled background image and honeycomb.  Now, they do in fact look great often, but they use so little of the potential rainmeter offers.  You may see that I actually agree with your post, op.  But: I think (and I am suret his was not your intention :D) we should be careful. People (like /u/TheIceRange) shouldn't feel the need to say sorry.  I really like the idea of a skin-of-the-month-contest, where one (or a combination of several) skins get put into focus.  Also (no idea if there is already) we could have a weekly ""Every question"" thread, where newcomers can pose a quick question, regardless how easy or ""dumb"" it may seem. Just as a simple way to try and keep all the newcomers here. [*edit: How could I miss the big green thread right at the top...? ;| ]  A theme of the week, where it's not only about the looks, but also the coolnes-factor / idea / creativity in using rainmeter could help bringing new ideas into this sub.  All in all: We need to show off the potential of rainmeter to ""activate"" the creative parts of everyone brains here to their full potential :D  edit: Maybe a weekly idea thread? Anyone, no matter if he can do it himself or not, can throw creative ideas in how to use rainmeter in new / interesting ways :D Again, if this already exists, sorry... :"

I'm hoping I can use what I learned to help make my skin in progress. http://imgur.com/a/nFivr Any ideas? My issue is that the icons I want to use are irregularly shaped and I'm trying to figure out how to get the mouse hover over to change the background picture. But your tutorial has helped a ton. Thanks so much again!

Here's what you do:   Make a graphic of the C9 logo with the black replaced with transparency. GIMP should be able to do this. Save it as a .PNG file. Make a replacement wallpaper that is solid black. Position your visualizer (VisBubble?) on the new wallpaper. Make a new skin with the graphic from step 1 as an image meter. Load this skin and position it over the visualizer. Right-click; go to settings, position, and select topmost so the skin stays 'above' the visualizer on the desktop.   That should do it.

Rainmeter,3clhwa,IAM_SATAN_AMA_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:17:38 2015 UTC,Ahh okay. I never knew AKs had such large rounds. Probably explains their stopping power.

Rainmeter,3clhwa,IAM_SATAN_AMA_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"I like your theme!   As a fellow designer and shooter, please light-heartedly take the following as constructive suggestions: When the bullet exits the barrel, it should just be the bullet itself, and not with the cartridge that holds the bullet. For example, I'd try take the top and bottom equalizer lines out. See how you like it, if you don't then put it back.  If it takes away too much detail from the equalizer levels i'd try playing with adding extra, intersecting & different colored equalizer lines at the edge of the barrel to mimic muzzle flash. I don't have much Rainmeter experience myself but it may be worth a shot (pun definitely intended)!   and add me on steam, lets play!:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J83UKApkEac"

Rainmeter,3cob25,radhaz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:19:02 2015 UTC,Quick fix is you can probably open it in your manage skin screen and manually shift it to the right or use /u/AprilFoolsGold method.  If you have time I would check the skins background size and verify it against the width of the visualizer though as when that happens to me it's often because I got sloppy with a transparent background and need to trim it down.

What you could also try doing is having the icons appear/disappear along the 8 edges of those two circular green vents.

So delete the code that was in that file and replace it with this code.  Step 1. How I did this is I have two Monstercat visualizers open, One I use as a player(The top left) the second I use as the actual visualizer. So before you do anything create two Monstercat visualizer folders.  For the player (top left) Change the Spotify.ini file to this, http://pastebin.com/njV6jzqG. Then Change the Variables.ini file to this, http://pastebin.com/QVRJesCi .   Now for the actual Visualizer you need to change the Spotify.ini file to this, http://pastebin.com/WfsHb8ve. And change the Variables folder to this, http://pastebin.com/GXxRxRGN.   Now For the overlay your going to need to watch this tutorial to understand how it works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4IjPDMWezg  Here is all of the Download links for all the skins I used. Honeycomb: Used for the icons on the left. http://apiium.deviantart.com/art/Honeycomb-467211707  Simple Media: The Clock used on the right. http://lilshizzy.deviantart.com/art/Rainmeter-Simple-Media-1-1-212678796  Monstercat Visualizer: This was the visualizer that I used to make it come out of the gun. Had to do a vast amount of coding to resize it and position it to the area I wanted. The player was also used with this monstercat visualzer, I just changed the variables sensitivity to 0 so I could just use it as a player. http://marcopixel.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Visualizer-for-Rainmeter-1-2-1-486330771  For my background and the outline I made: http://imgur.com/a/xBmCm  Hopefully I provided you guys with enough for you to do it on your own. Tell me any problems and I will try to change my instructions to make it work for you. I would love to see screenshots of your screens to know it worked for you. UPVOTE THIS SO OTHERS CAN SEE!  Edit: So I know a lot of people have been complaining about the resolution. My screens aren't that big so I had to make it my own resolution to work. So here is the full res version that I could find. Your going to have to make your own outline though using the video I posted in this comment. Good luck. https://i.imgur.com/NMLRv6b.png For the Bullet outline I used was this, http://pngimg.com/upload/bullets_PNG1468.png .

Rainmeter,3cgow0,Fritz125,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"how to set up honeycomb  by: me  1) Find the rainmeter icon in the bottom right of your computer screen. It looks like this: http://imgur.com/0OHbTin. It could also be hidden in that tray thingy(?) that pops up when you press the arrow. lol idk what to call it  2) Right-click the icon to open up the menu. Click 'Manage' at the top, it should be bolded. I'd take a picture but I'm afraid this surpasses my very limited knowledge of how to use the snipping tool.  3) A new window should open up named 'Manage Rainmeter': http://imgur.com/Htta7zy.  4) On the left side there's a panel with a folder that says Honeycomb (if you have it installed correctly). Expand the folder by clicking the small arrow to the left of the folder name: http://imgur.com/aho2SO0.  5) Find the application name you want to make a hexagon on your desktop. I'll use Guild Wars 2 as an example: http://imgur.com/aGULnqQ.  6) Expand that folder by pressing the small arrow to the left of the folder name. There should be a .ini file inside that folder. Click on the .ini file to show more options. http://imgur.com/nwgXFNe  7) On the right side of the 'Manage Rainmeter' window, there should be two buttons that you can press. You can choose to either load the hexagon or edit it. The simplest way to have it show on your desktop is to just hit 'Load'. http://imgur.com/GFzq2Yk  8) Once you click 'Load', go to your desktop. At the top left corner there should be a hexagon with the icon of the application you wanted! http://imgur.com/fmhDNp0.  You can drag the icon around your computer screen and put it where ever you want. It sort of locks in place also, if you put it near other hexagons: http://imgur.com/7obeamM. Honeycomb might not have all the applications you want to hexagonize, so be warned :(. You could probably ask apiium at his/her deviantart to make one, but idk if he/she frequently checks it. Link: http://apiium.deviantart.com/art/Honeycomb-467211707  I think there's also way to make your own icons using Honeycomb, but I'm not sure how. I just started using Rainmeter a few days ago. Hope this helps! :)"

Rainmeter,3cgow0,Undecided_Username_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"The way I installed honeycomb was by downloading rainmeter first, and then once I got that set up I downloaded honeycomb from apiium's deviantart. The honeycomb file should appear in your downloads folder like this, and listed as 'Rainmeter Skin Installer' under 'Type': http://imgur.com/EqJnSlD.  I opened the file and if you have rainmeter installed correctly, you should see a window like this: http://imgur.com/pXktlJR. Mine actually looks a bit different because I've already installed honeycomb, but if it's the first time then you should still be able to click install at the bottom.  After that, you should be able to find the honeycomb folder in your rainmeter manage menu or w/e it's called. Like I said above on the left side panel you should see the honeycomb folder and whatever other skins you have installed. Illustro is the skin everyone starts off with btw.

The Speedfan app can generate logs in I believe .csv which you could use to the pull the information You might be able to use the window WMIC to get the data via the command line and output it to a file for yourself.   Getting the data is only half the battle of course, sharing is the other. If it was me I'd consider running a webserver to host the data on a local network and then you could use your workstations rainmeter skin to pull the data via webparser. I've used the analogx webserver in the past for lanparties but there's a myriad of options to choose from for you.  This is all so rube goldbergian though that I would hope there's a much simpler solution available for you & with any luck someone other than myself will post it.

I always hit Refresh All when I copy new skins into the folder, but sometimes not all of them show up.

Alternatively you could name all the wallpapers a range of numbers (e.g. from 0.jpg to 99.jpg) and then have for example a Lua script generate random numbers to select the images to use as wallpapers.  I think the bang for setting Windows' wallpaper will apply the same wallpaper to both monitors. One workaround would be to use two image meters to display the wallpapers."

(hope that made sense)   thats done using bangs!  you need the !togglefadegroup bang and youll just type   leftmouseupaction=[!togglefadegroup yourgroupname]  so for example a skin i made recently was doing this with triangles and the witcher 3, this is a section i made.    [Witcher3]  Meter=STRING  x=#tab#  y=0  SolidColor=0,0,0,1  Text=Witcher 3  FontFace=#FontFace#  FontSize=#FontSize#  FontColor=#FontColorActive#  StringAlign=LEFT  AntiAlias=1  MouseOverAction=[!showfadegroup Geralt3]  mouseleaveaction=[!hidefadegroup Geralt3]  leftmouseupaction=[steam://rungameid/292030]  this section caused triangle pictures to fade in and out whenever my mouse was over it.    bang manual is here http://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/bangs after that you have to save and reload the skins but it should work!  any questions or if i was confusing i'm around on reddit far too much"

Rainmeter,3bxwz2,kpfettstyle,2,Fri Jul 3 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"I recommend you use VisBubble for your audio visualizer, and put it on the death star. The flat visualizer looks kinda out of place.  EDIT: Also try playing around with various transparencies for the skins. Just right click on the skin and then go to Settings/Transperancy. Use fade in if you want the skin to fade back to full opacity when you scroll over it. :)"
Rainmeter,3bxwz2,BigRedScarf,2,Fri Jul 3 18:34:49 2015 UTC,Thanks! I have the vis bubble and tried that but it doesn't line up very well. I have moved some things around since and the visualizer doesn't look as out of place any more. I'll try messing with transparency
Rainmeter,3bxwz2,BigRedScarf,2,Fri Jul 3 19:17:38 2015 UTC,no problem! :)

Rainmeter,3bwiln,gmteag01,3,Thu Jul 2 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"I mainly use Rainmeter for tracking CPU and GPU temperatures as well. I've been working on some new skins to do so, which are all in varying states of completion. The circular line graphs I've been working on are mostly done though. Below is a preview. I'm planning to make them all available when I'm done, but if you're interested I can provide you a download link now.  Circular CPU/GPU Temp Meter Preview"

As stated in the Rainmeter manual, the unit in the SpeedFan application itself must be set to Celsius to obtain the correct value."
Rainmeter,3bwiln,flirtinwithdisaster,2,Thu Jul 2 21:29:00 2015 UTC,Flat and Blurry is what I use.

Rainmeter,3buyjp,SamFuchs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:02:53 2015 UTC,I use the latest spotify and the skins I use work fine. Are you sure you are using the ones with the spotify plugin and not the nowplaying plugin?

Rainmeter,3buyjp,Decroxx,3,Thu Jul 2 11:50:20 2015 UTC,Yep. Works totally fine. Be sure to use the spotify skin tho. Not the normal one.
Rainmeter,3buyjp,HybrideGaming,2,Thu Jul 2 18:22:56 2015 UTC,360  This 100% works and is what I use!
Rainmeter,3buyjp,gatorzero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:09:40 2015 UTC,I can vouch for this. Its the only skin I've gotten to work with Spotify.
Rainmeter,3buyjp,narcoticninja,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:30:29 2015 UTC,"You can download the SpotifyPlugin.dll and get an existing skin to work. http://rainmeter.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=17077 It may take a bit of work, but its possible."
Rainmeter,3bvw4o,dracebus,4,Thu Jul 2 16:07:43 2015 UTC,1.Opening a program via rainmeter is like double clicking the exe. If opens the program but nothing more.   It doesn’t even remotely use the same technical stuff that windows gadgets use. It’s fairly safe. I’ve never heard of a rainmeter backdoor  Rmskin packages are as far as I know just zips
Rainmeter,3bvw4o,MayhemCha0s,2,Thu Jul 2 16:36:36 2015 UTC,I can confirm that rmskin packages are literally renamed .zip files
Rainmeter,3bvw4o,legobmw99,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:36 2015 UTC,and what kind of files can you find in there?
