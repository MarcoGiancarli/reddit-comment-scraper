Between starting the Kessel to Florida rumor at the deadline,  saying a deal with Huberdeau was close when they were still having preliminary talks, his inability to use spell check and all of the other mistakes he frequently makes, the guy is just a terrible source. Especially with they way he states fiction as fact and people freak out when he turns out to be wrong.   Also linking the tweet where Walsh rebuked him on Huberdeau's contract being ""close"" until the deal is actually done would hopefully calm down some of the people who are worried that it isn't done yet."

Could we have a monthly header that highlights a player on the team?  I also think the pic of the week should be a thread we could all deliberate and argue in, rather than submitted anonymously.  Maybe when the season starts we can have a goal of the year rankings board? With youtube links or in gif format?

I tried making weekly picture threads, but they always remained blank and no one submitted or commented. In fact I've never even had one submitted anonymously either, but I'd for sure bring the threads back if people would want it.

FloridaPanthers,3ddvda,Nobartholem,3,Wed Jul 15 14:33:39 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Crouse will go down as one of the Panthers' better draft selections.

He has very little downside. It's not even a 50% chance that a first round pick plays regularly as a top 6 forward so the Cats are already ahead on this one."
FloridaPanthers,3ddvda,klocks,2,Wed Jul 15 22:59:09 2015 UTC,"Awesome news, especially with how promising he sounds.  Still a little worried about Huberdeau. I'm wondering if he wants a bigger contract than he deserves right now, and that's the hold up. We all know he can be a star player deserving of a top contract, but up until the last 30 games (and his first year) he hasn't played like it."
FloridaPanthers,3ddvda,Godfarber,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about Huberdeau because his name is not on the list of players that have elected to go to arbitration.

FloridaPanthers,3d4id6,Necrogasmic,3,Mon Jul 13 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"Ok so I'm about to tear this article apart bit by bit here.    The Lightning came into the NHL a year before the Panthers, yet have had been a bigger draw with fans there since. This is probably due to the fact that the team has made the Stanley Cup Finals twice — winning it in 2003. But it also might have to do with its name. The Tampa Bay Lightning represent the Tampa Bay area. The Panthers, on the other hand, represent... Florida?   No it's not because they are called Tampa Bay, it's because they have won a cup and have been putting competitive teams on the ice. There isn't a fan of that team anywhere in the world that is only a fan because the name is ""Tampa Bay."" I guess that's why the rays get so many fans out, because people just love supporting teams name Tampa Bay.    Civic Pride   This one is kinda dumb. What's to stop people from cheering for their home state vs their home town. Should the avalanche change their name to Denver Avalanche so people have more city pride to cheer for the team? No, the name won't make anyone more or less proud, performance on the ice will make them want to cheer for them.    Cooler Looking Swag   Now we are just getting worse. What makes a city name on there look any cooler than the state name? If anything Fort Lauderdale is too long and would look dumber. Not to mention the explain logo they gave is SO SO dumb and ugly.    Imagine, instead of the old palm tree and hokey stick logo, a panther wearing sunglasses riding a yacht throughout the intracoastal. That new panther logo would be, as the kids say, ""on fleek.""   No, as the kids say that new logo would be dumb as fuck.    Better TV Ratings and Ticket Sales   Uhm, why? A name change doesn't move the arena. It doesn't make the team better so why would these things go up. The proof that a name change doesn't change these things is the Miami Marlins...speaking of which, point 4.    The Marlins Did It   Yes because the Marlins got such higher attendance after changing their name. I'm not even sure why the author added this in as a argument for the change. If anything this is the prime example of why name changes don't matter.    Fort Lauderdale Needs a Pro Team   OK, so maybe it should get one and not try and steal one from the neighboring city in which the panthers play in. That can also be applied to all the above points, we play from Sunrise not Fort Lauderdale. And the reason Miami claims all the sports teams is because they are 4 times bigger than Fort Lauderdale."

FloridaPanthers,3cvcd3,lamaba,4,Sat Jul 11 02:12:41 2015 UTC,He'd probably hold Bolland back.
FloridaPanthers,3cvcd3,McPhatiusJackson,3,Sat Jul 11 06:57:38 2015 UTC,Sharp had a NTC so he had to agree to the team he went to as well
FloridaPanthers,3cvcd3,braddaugherty8,2,Sat Jul 11 06:18:32 2015 UTC,I truly think the Panthers didn't want him.  They have a pretty set roster and I think letting Pirri grow into that scoring role is a better option than gambling on Sharp.  Also it's not worth the pieces they would've had to give up for him.
FloridaPanthers,3cvcd3,PaddyKane,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:04:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wouldn't mind us trying to trade for a guaranteed scorer, but letting our guys develop into that is totally fine with me."

On one hand Huberdeau has a decent amount of leverage to get a good bridge contract, but on the other hand the deal was ""very close"" almost 2 weeks ago, and I'm surprised nothing has been announced at all. It gives me the feeling that something is amiss, but I'm sure everything is just fine"

Hopefully it's a favorable contract for the Cats"

FloridaPanthers,3cobca,xDaeshaunx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:41:05 2015 UTC,It's beginning to look like Dale made it rain during the extremely hit-or-miss 2011 draft.
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,CrockettTubbs,4,Wed Jul 8 23:42:44 2015 UTC,I got to watch Crouse play regularly for the last couple of years and he is a great draft pick. He's a big body and skates really well. He is very physical as well and tends to lead the physical play while on the ice. He was a great leader while playing for the Frontenacs as well.   I'm really excited to see him as a Panther. It was a steal for him to drop down to 11. I think there might be a good chance he plays at least the 9 games before his ELC would kick in. He could easily fill the role that Jimmy Hayes left and I would be awesome for him to get to learn from Jagr for a season.
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,klocks,5,Thu Jul 9 04:02:04 2015 UTC,"I am super pumped he dropped that far down. I was not expecting to even have a shot at him.   He was widely picked to be the player with the most ""secret"" potential as in the player you look back on in 5-10 years and think how the hell did he drop all the way to 11 he should have been top 5. Kinda like Perry or Weber, when you look back it where they got drafted you wonder how it wasn't much higher.   As for preformace I think he will very soon be our second line LW (behind Huberdeau). Him and Bjug on a line with whoever on the right, now that's a big line and is an amazing second line."
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,jrad151,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:14:17 2015 UTC,I love the idea of pairing Crouse and Bjug together. That line will heretofore be known as the Natural Disasters (WWF/E joke).
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,thewbacca,3,Thu Jul 9 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"Good pick.  Someone that actually watched him play in the OHL said he does more than what those highlight videos on youtube suggest (off the puck play and all).  Also, him and Juho Lammikko (FIN drafted by FLA in 14') played on a line together in Kingston, Crouse actually helped Lammikko adapt to NA life & hockey.  I'd like to see Crouse spend one more year in the OHL to really polish his offense, his defensive play is already pro though."
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,nighthawk3000,2,Thu Jul 9 00:27:30 2015 UTC,I honestly don't know much about him. Any chance he makes the roster for the start of the season?
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,McPhatiusJackson,3,Wed Jul 8 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"It's certainly not out of the question. Physically, he's ready to rock. The main concern about him is his long-term offensive upside. I understand that, but it's important to keep in mind that Kingston was just a godawful offensive team for much of last season."
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,ohnoitsrambo,2,Thu Jul 9 01:02:43 2015 UTC,"I was so sold on Rantanen and Meier that I was in such a sour mood to even be excited for Crouse. I knew nothing about him and didn't bother to learn just because he was always in the top 10 in rankings. Immediately after though, I looked around and my opinion of him has grown."
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,Meatballjk,2,Wed Jul 8 23:58:19 2015 UTC,"I can only imagine your reaction upon seeing those two go Nos. 9 and 10 overall.   I bought into the whole Crouse-to-Philadelphia hype train for most of the spring, but once Provorov and Werenski began screaming up draft boards and mock drafts, I figured the Panthers had a realistic chance of landing a top-rated forward."

FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,Nobartholem,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"Whenever we draft new picks, I'm always most excited to see what they think about coming here. Obviously they're all skilled players, so seeing their reaction shows me a lot about their character; and Crouse looked like a kid who's dreams just came true. I'm excited for him to be here and to watch him play. Hopefully he becomes a key part to our team."
FloridaPanthers,3cm3f6,Codyshagovac,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"Crouse looks really excited, which is good. He seems to have a lot of fight in him from the highlights I watched of him in Kingston and Development Camp. I hope he can crack the opening day roster, but the Panthers need goals and I'm a little doubtful that he can provide that.  A little of wary of the offensive ability, but Crouse is a prototypical Tallon-esque draft pick. He's big, fast, strong, and driven. I'm really excited to see him compete in camp against some better competition than the OHL.  I wanted the Panthers to pick Rantanen  originally, and I was a little miffed when he went 10th; however, the more I see of Crouse the better I feel."

FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:43:47 2015 UTC,so you guys are expecting Trocheck and Grimaldi to be full time next season?
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,lamaba,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"Trocheck at a certain point became full time, and yes I do think Grimaldi is being brought up this season.  That may have been why we bought out Boyes."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,lamaba,2,Tue Jul 7 20:54:56 2015 UTC,so follow up question then: what is the hype level for Panther fans this season? what are the realistic expectations
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,KensterFox,6,Tue Jul 7 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't speak for everyone here, but I'm pretty hyped.  We get to see the Huberdeau-Barkov-Jagr line play together for an entire season.  I think we'll be competing for a wild card spot."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,lamaba,4,Tue Jul 7 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Panthers will ""compete for a wild card spot"". The Panthers will be better and finish ahead of the Sabres, Bruins, and Maple Leafs easily. And while it's possible that both the Senators and the Red Wings (sorry, /u/pkthunde) play up to their potential enough to push the Panthers to the fringe of the playoff hunt, I don't think that's likely.  The Panthers will make the playoffs comfortably, and will compete for one of the top three divisional spots."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,KensterFox,6,Tue Jul 7 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to temper my expectations here.  If the Panthers have taught me anything, it's don't set the bar too high."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,CrockettTubbs,3,Tue Jul 7 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"While I understand that, I'd also say that the Viola-and-Cifu era Panthers don't really resemble what came before, so it's time to leave those lessons behind. And while the lockout season and the one after were crushingly disappointing, I'd attribute that to our momentum being killed by the lockout itself than to anything else. I don't see any momentum-killer coming this offseason."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,KensterFox,3,Tue Jul 7 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"This x 1,000. I think the Panthers are ready to begin wreaking havoc.  I thought inexperience was what kept the Panthers from making the playoffs last season. I expect them to make the leap this season, and as their youngsters become more savvy, I believe this team will become a legitimate nightmare in the Eastern Conference. Their defensive depth is about as good as it gets, and their forward depth isn't far off from what you'd find on a successful Western Conference squad (especially at center, where the Panthers have an insane amount of depth). Again, inexperience remains a factor for most of the personnel, but the skill and high upside are unquestionably there.  Forgive me for the ridiculous comparison, but last year's Panthers reminded me a lot of the 2007-08 Chicago Blackhawks—mammoth talent on the roster, but too green to capitalize on it with any sort of consistency."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,CrockettTubbs,3,Tue Jul 7 22:10:34 2015 UTC,"Seeing as how they were both Dale Tallon-built teams, I don't think the comparison is that ridiculous."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,jrad151,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:16:37 2015 UTC,Ha. Thanks. I was afraid I'd get pasted for likening a fringe playoff team to a squad that went on to win three Stanley Cups. But I couldn't help but draw that parallel during the second half of last season.
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,Pinmonkey,2,Tue Jul 7 22:38:02 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the Panthers should be better next year, I have a hard time thinking that they will push Tampa, Detroit or Montreal out of a top 3 spot. Detroit took Tampa to game 7 and arguably should have won that series, and our roster has only gotten better. The same can be said of Tampa's line up. Montreal didnt have much improvement, but they still have Subban and Price. I just don't see the Panthers as anything more than a potential wildcard team"
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,jrad151,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:30 2015 UTC,"For sure going to be some young guys moving up for full time duty. We've had some vets leave, haven't signed any NHL players and have been beefing up our AHL signings. It appears as though those AHL players will be replacing some guys as they move up to the big leagues."
FloridaPanthers,3cgqg7,Pinmonkey,2,Wed Jul 8 12:17:55 2015 UTC,Who was Pirri playing with when he scored all those goals? Put him with those guys again.

FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,ohnoitsrambo,3,Wed Jul 1 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"I was getting the same vibe. But looking at the stats, he has a better scoring touch and he's faster. He may be a victim of misuse in Boston."

FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,jrad151,2,Thu Jul 2 01:12:52 2015 UTC,I'm thinking maybe this move was for Savard. His cap hit is negligible but perhaps he wanted to take advantage of the no income tax down here and move his family down here? Only thing I can think of. We're a good 10 mil over the floor

FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,zipperoooo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:10:25 2015 UTC,I don't know where you got your info from but Tallon went on TV and straight up said that we had to take Savard to get the deal done. And we were already above the floor without resigning Huberdeau.
FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,ThatFuh_Qr,-1,Thu Jul 2 03:41:20 2015 UTC,"Doesn't make any sense to force him out from our end; his cap hit was mostly paid for, meaning he's a 4mil hit for 500k, meaning cheap bump for any team below 50m. That's an asset, not a weight."
FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,zipperoooo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:49:16 2015 UTC,It also cuts into that 10% that you can spend over during offseason. Sweeney probably didn't want to deal with that shit.
FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,ThatFuh_Qr,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:07:33 2015 UTC,"That's true, but we've only got 4m less free space than you guys right now.  The lack of Dougie really opened up a ton of available cap, as did getting bargains on Spooner and Beleskey.  We're not in a critical situation with that stuff.  I mean, it makes no sense to package Savard as a necessary handcuff to a trade, not when teams like Arizona and Edmonton are trying to spend as much as they can to get to the floor."
FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,zipperoooo,2,Fri Jul 3 17:16:00 2015 UTC,How many contracts do Bruins have right now? I don't know if LTIR counts towards the 50 contract limit but perhaps they just wanted to open up and extra spot for a prospect.

FloridaPanthers,3bsyp9,Necrogasmic,2,Wed Jul 1 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"If the Panthers move a big contract and need to make the floor, they can count Savard against it.

His 38 points last year would have led our team the year before. Not saying that's amazing... just saying that he's one of the more productive guys on the team - and his hit is less than $3M. I could see buying out Kopecky. Boyes? I don't get it.  Maybe this will make more sense tomorrow."
FloridaPanthers,3bnfll,Pinmonkey,2,Tue Jun 30 21:39:32 2015 UTC,"This makes sense if and only if we decide to make a serious offer for Patrick Sharp. He wasn't exactly at his best this past season, but that boy can score and score often. He'd be a more than welcome addition to this hockey club in my opinion."
FloridaPanthers,3bnfll,Pinmonkey,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:07:46 2015 UTC,"Also like, you couldn't make a trade happen, dude? He's been pretty good for a guy being paid 2.5 a year; I bet SOMEONE would take that."
FloridaPanthers,3bmsbn,bropez23,3,Tue Jun 30 14:06:15 2015 UTC,"Aside from Crouse, the pick I'm most interested in/excited for is Denis Malgin. Kid has some serious skill and blazing speed. If he can switch to RW at some point he is exactly what we need going forward. It will probably be around 2-3 years before he even comes to North America so there's no real point in being TOO excited about him right now.  There aren't many highlights if you search for him but I managed to find these:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZrpjrZVn8c&feature=youtu.be&t=16m25s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZrpjrZVn8c&feature=youtu.be&t=1h55m28s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tsBN62BHZE&feature=youtu.be&t=13m39s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6F86DbBtGhw"
FloridaPanthers,3bmsbn,Bjugerdeau,2,Tue Jun 30 14:42:45 2015 UTC,another goalie that isn't Al Montoya

FloridaPanthers,3bltip,ohnoitsrambo,3,Tue Jun 30 06:57:28 2015 UTC,Two vets to fill out the 3rd 4th line respectively. Youth is good but experience is vital for a young team. Cleary or Comeau??
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,beefat99,3,Tue Jun 30 07:06:11 2015 UTC,Cleary   I hope youre not talking Dan Cleary. I dont want him anywhere near this team.
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,Spear994,2,Tue Jun 30 14:24:58 2015 UTC,"Bruh what are you doing up so late 😱  And yeah, I think it could be wise. I don't want it to be a thing where we have Grimaldi playing 4th line minutes with Thornton."
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,beefat99,2,Tue Jun 30 07:17:25 2015 UTC,Woke up for water and couldn't fall back asleep
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,McPhatiusJackson,3,Tue Jun 30 13:15:11 2015 UTC,"You can scratch Boyes off the roster, he got bought out. He'll either be replaced with Howden or Grimaldi."
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,blueandgoldjli,2,Tue Jun 30 17:00:14 2015 UTC,That Crouse/Bjugstad/Hayes line is fucking huge.
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,steve_the_barberian,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"Crouse: 6'4, 212  Bjug: 6'6, 218  Hayes: 6'6, 221  Ohhhhhhh baby"
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,jrad151,2,Tue Jun 30 23:37:06 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine Crouse is slotted in on 2nd line, unless he blows everyone mind at training camp. I'd put pirri on 2 and crouse on 3 with Jussi and BOlland"
FloridaPanthers,3bltip,Roughly6Owls,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:37:18 2015 UTC,I just think a line of all 6'4+ 210+ players would be something pretty cool
FloridaPanthers,3bitaa,dunkcitybitch,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"I was getting worried I hadn't heard anything yet. Huberdeau, Howden, Hayes, and Petrovic are must signs."
FloridaPanthers,3bi43e,Meatballjk,6,Mon Jun 29 12:18:08 2015 UTC,He's not eligible. He can make the jump in 2016-17.
FloridaPanthers,3bi43e,coopdaloop123,3,Mon Jun 29 13:58:56 2015 UTC,"""American and Canadian-born players must be 20 years old by Jan. 15 of the current season in order to be eligible to play in the American Hockey League. When it comes to Europeans, they are eligible to play as long as they are not playing/or have been drafted in the Canadian Hockey League (Western Hockey League, Ontario Hockey League, Quebec Major Junior Hockey League). Same rules apply if they have enrolled in college in the United States.  The minimum age for those players is 18.""  So technically he is able to be sent to Portland. But I think they'll wait and decide what they'll do with Howden and Grimaldi."
FloridaPanthers,3bi43e,MarmeladovsBottle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:40:59 2015 UTC,"I guess because they feel it would be counter productive to his development? The same reason their are questions when even someone like Barkov or Huberdeau went straight into the NHL. Just because you are killing it in junior hockey doesn't mean going up a step won't hurt your immediate development.  Big fish, small pond and all that."
FloridaPanthers,3bi43e,ExBritNStuff,2,Mon Jun 29 12:48:47 2015 UTC,Huberdeau didn't go straight to the NHL. He spent one more season in the Q. Then there was the lock out so he stayed in the Q untill January (or when ever the saeson started).
FloridaPanthers,3bi43e,klabob,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:25:15 2015 UTC,"He's still young, and it's probably best to keep him somewhere he won't struggle so his development continues until he can handle the higher level of competition."
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,jrad151,6,Sun Jun 28 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"How would we use Talbot with Luongo and Montoya still on the roster... Would we play him as a backup and Montoya playing in the AHL?  I like Jimmy Hayes too, maybe he isn't Kevin Hayes but he's our Hayes."
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,beefat99,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:09:16 2015 UTC,"They'd trade off Montoya probably, you cant trade Lu's and we love lu so we arent trading him."
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,HyperMidgit,3,Sun Jun 28 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"Kind of glad it fell through. I love Hayes, and while we need to start thinking of who will, someday, replace Lu, seems like a lot for a rental like Talbot."
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,linnypotter,3,Sun Jun 28 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"Hayes is 20 goal scorer in my eyes, I think he can hit 25~ goals and on this panthers team starved for goals, Not something i'd give up. But we DO need a replacement once lu starts to slow"
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,HyperMidgit,2,Sun Jun 28 21:20:13 2015 UTC,at this point I want us to bring in any goalie on the face of the earth if it means getting rid of montoya
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,eadie30,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:18:33 2015 UTC,montoya for scrivens
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,Rogay,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:27:04 2015 UTC,that would be a dream
FloridaPanthers,3bezgq,eadie30,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:10:15 2015 UTC,Why in the hell would they trade Hayes?
FloridaPanthers,3bdgfe,RedSteeg32,3,Sun Jun 28 04:26:30 2015 UTC,Solid pick. is a moose along the wall down low gives me a lot of hope for how tough the Panthers will be to play against in the future. PP Goalie screener all the way.
FloridaPanthers,3bb14b,dooday21,5,Sat Jun 27 14:30:46 2015 UTC,I've never felt worse for Bruins fans than I do now.
FloridaPanthers,3bb14b,lamaba,4,Sat Jun 27 16:32:53 2015 UTC,I've never felt bad for Bruins fans before. I feel dirty.
FloridaPanthers,3bb14b,ThatFuh_Qr,2,Sun Jun 28 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"I loved that he came back for the second pick and said ""booed again, huh?"" Before before surprising everyone with the next pick"
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,beefat99,19,Sat Jun 27 00:21:42 2015 UTC,OMG THIS IS AMAZING. NO WAY I THOUGHT HE WOULD DROP THIS LOW.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,jrad151,13,Sat Jun 27 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Ate a worm in the Everglades and hit a home run at Marlins Park.  I like this kid.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,KensterFox,3,Sat Jun 27 01:11:21 2015 UTC,ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,linnypotter,11,Sat Jun 27 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"Somebody get a gif of the kid screaming, ""Woo, yeah!"" At the Panthers pick and combine it with the Knicks crying kid..."

FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,theasfldotcom,2,Sat Jun 27 04:56:30 2015 UTC,That was my reaction at the pick too
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,jrad151,9,Sun Jun 28 01:12:44 2015 UTC,"Crouching Crouse, Hidden Ekblad"
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,Commandant1,7,Sat Jun 27 02:26:36 2015 UTC,Scouting report http://lastwordonsports.com/2015/04/11/2015-nhl-draft-profile-11-lawson-crouse/
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,braddaugherty8,6,Sat Jun 27 00:22:16 2015 UTC,Kids gonna be a beast!!
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,Commandant1,8,Sat Jun 27 00:22:26 2015 UTC,"Great pick, huge power forward to play in the top 6."
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,lamaba,7,Sat Jun 27 00:22:58 2015 UTC,Wooooo!  And we got to see Bill Torrey in all his bow-tie glory.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,ohnoitsrambo,5,Sat Jun 27 00:25:39 2015 UTC,We're good with this!? Cool! Wonder if he makes the squad next season
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,ohnoitsrambo,8,Sat Jun 27 01:34:35 2015 UTC,He has a good shot. Him and Jimmy Hayes on the same line would be a physical threat.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,jrad151,4,Sat Jun 27 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"I like physical but I like scoring too :( But I agree they would be killer. Damn, I'm really warming up to this guy"
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,ohnoitsrambo,3,Sat Jun 27 02:32:40 2015 UTC,Crouse might be a better scorer than Hayes.  Imagine Hayes who also plays like...someone who chills in the crease and fucks the goalie while having some mid range ability.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,Number333,3,Sat Jun 27 02:34:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be a better scorer than Hayes, but he is the kind of grinder player that ever cup/playoff team has/needs that does what he needs to do and seems to go under the radar.  In other words. He is key for us."
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,Rogay,2,Sat Jun 27 06:05:25 2015 UTC,I think Crouse can become a scorer...
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,Godfarber,2,Sat Jun 27 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"That would be nice, we need someone grindy on our team"
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,HyperMidgit,5,Sat Jun 27 02:41:46 2015 UTC,Wooooooooooo!   Also loved the reaction from the crowd.
FloridaPanthers,3b97bi,linnypotter,3,Sat Jun 27 02:12:26 2015 UTC,I WAS THERE! I SAW IT ALL!
