BeautyBoxes,3e5i8z,DiKetian,5,Wed Jul 22 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"I've been subscribed to beauty boxes for at least 7+ years (I started with Glymm when I was in undergrad), and in a fit of high spirits I dug through my bathroom and found (almost) everything that I still have that came in a beauty box! This is, of course, excluding everything I've used up or given / thrown away, a few items I've left in my office, and I know I've probably missed some nail polishes.  Let's see pics of your stashes from over the years, ladies!  Also there seems to be some confusion, I use up items as I go so 90% of the stuff there is under a year old. People seem very pro-purge but I couldn't see chucking perfectly good makeup unless it's gone bad or is unuseable. Plus, the lipsticks and nail polishes are only parts of my larger hoards!   Edit: I found more under the sink! http://imgur.com/3gqAf0Q"

I've really decluttered my life the last two years. Also stuff expires so I don't want to accidentally put it on my face.  I just canceled my last beauty box last week."

BeautyBoxes,3e367m,DiKetian,18,Tue Jul 21 16:34:08 2015 UTC,Hi! The exact same thing happened to me. I even contacted them prior to ordering to confirm that shipping was free and they said yes. I got an email a week after I ordered (yup 7 days) telling me to give them 10 more dollars. I told them they had mislead me and to cancel my order. No apology or anything.  Just a cancelled status update. Too bad because it wasn't a big deal to pay the extra 10. I just didn't like dealing with them.
BeautyBoxes,3e367m,iamhuxley,9,Tue Jul 21 17:12:17 2015 UTC,I actually had a shipping issue with them as well. My tracking stopped about 7 days ago and my bag is apparently in limbo. Beautifiedyou basically gave me a lukewarm response and didn't help at all..even though I paid for it.
BeautyBoxes,3e367m,imhereforthemeta,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:38 2015 UTC,"Mine did the same thing... supposed to deliver 7/18. Just emailed them to see what's going on, but eesh. Disappointing!"

That really is an awful thing for them to do! I only bought two bags out of curiosity, and I live in WA. Other than taking almost a month for my $5 bag to get to me, I didn't experience any issue. I'm really disappointed to hear that they are giving other folks a hard time!"
BeautyBoxes,3e367m,apprberriepie,5,Tue Jul 21 18:12:48 2015 UTC,I just got my $15 bag yesterday and I didn't have any issues. Sucks that they're not straightforward about the shipping outside the U.S. though. :( And the poor customer service response is definitely troubling.

BeautyBoxes,3e367m,ArcadiaRhodes,5,Tue Jul 21 21:06:18 2015 UTC,So they're not even consistent in who they fuck around with either!   How recently was this? If I can ever get through to them now I've got more ammo.
BeautyBoxes,3e367m,ArcadiaRhodes,3,Tue Jul 21 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"According to the tracking, it's in transit as we speak. Ordered it a few weeks ago."

I can see charging more for international shipping, but that type of customer service will destroy a company. I'm not going to shop there now, for sure."

BeautyBoxes,3e367m,TacoBellQuesadilla,2,Tue Jul 21 23:20:33 2015 UTC,I just went on the website to order one and under the description it says Free Shipping (U.S Only) so did you maybe just not see that or did they just go in an add that? aha
BeautyBoxes,3e367m,TacoBellQuesadilla,2,Tue Jul 21 22:13:05 2015 UTC,They definitely just added that. Check the shipping calculator too - does it still say free when you put in Canada?

Did you by any chance get the Fresca Voxbox that came with the mini Airbrush Legs?  Because if so you don't have to buy it and can just use that.

Ended up getting the first 2 Revealed palettes, a 10 blush palette (I do like the blushes but the packaging is monstrous), and I got the brush set for my sister.  A $50 brush set for $25.    Side story, got the brush set and the snaps on the case were broken.  The one half of the snap was on the lid but the bottom part of the case didn't have the other half of the snap!  If it were for me I wouldn't have cared too much, but I contacted them to see if I could possibly get a new case.  They sent me a brand new entire brush set and didn't ask me to return the original one.  Soooo I kept the broken one and my sister got her gift. :)  Edit: oops sorry not sure if you thought it was a Birchbox Black Friday sale...definitely a Coastal Scents Black Friday sale..."
BeautyBoxes,3e51ik,savahontas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:51:38 2015 UTC,I did think it was Birchbox so I am so glad I asked! I will wait for Black Friday and see what Coastal Scents offers.

Great coverage,  spf, blends easily, doesn't break me out, stays put through hot summer days. I got the light-med for summer and am saving points to get light for winter.  I also just placed an order and am really excited about the Avene Revitalizing Hydration Kit for $23. I feel like I found a hidden gem with this one as it isn't really advertised and there are only a few reviews. Haven't gotten it yet so I can't offer a review myself yet, but I love the brand and the kit seemed like an amazing deal for everything you get, and it's a good way to try out a bunch of their stuff."

BeautyBoxes,3e0ry8,bookwithoutpics,7,Tue Jul 21 02:01:58 2015 UTC,I got the Classico in my ipsy this month and thought it smelled waaaaay too Harvey Prince for my taste. Their scents are some of the only ones I actively dislike.
BeautyBoxes,3e0ry8,HotTotXoXo,8,Tue Jul 21 02:10:22 2015 UTC,This is just so weird to me. Why would Harvey Prince distribute the same perfume under two different brands/names?  I feel like it has almost ruined Femina for me :p

I get that a lot of HP perfume doesn't smell great and I get that it's annoying that Birchbox keeps sending it, but I don't get this subreddit's burning hatred for the brand and inability to accept that they could possibly do someting right.  ""Hello"" is a really great fragrance, the full size is one of the best sellers, and I have actually been happy to receive the perfume, lotion, and body wash in that scent.  It smells amazing.

I opened the bag and thought there was $50 fucking American dollars in it! Nope, it's just the packaging for these sheet masks but boy it had me fooled.

TonyMoly is also one of my favourite Korean brands - I've bought all their fruit-shaped cosmetics! SNP Beijing Opera Mask in Brightening. The fabled Beijing opera masks! I actually have a different one in my cupboard from SNP as well. Right now face masks with animal faces or Beijing opera masks are really trendy in Korea and I love it! I think I look a bit more like I've got Maori tattoos with this one. I've had to order these off Ebay in the past, it's so nice to actually get one in a beauty box!

Link all your social media accounts - the more followers you have, the greater 'influence' you have and are more likely to get picked. It's all about spreading the word.   Companies partner with influenester. Based on your profile, if influenester thinks you're a good fit - you get to do a pre-qualifying survey then hopefully get invited the the campaign. They send you products for free and typically just ask for a website/store review (in this case, on sephora.com) and social media buzz. You complete tasks for badges and a chance at prizes.   After about a month, the whole process starts again.   I've only ever gotten drugstore shampoo & conditioner in the past. So super HE makeup this time around is awesome."

BeautyBoxes,3dzu02,xotori,2,Mon Jul 20 23:26:40 2015 UTC,"So jealous! I got the SunshineVoxbox, so I'm happy with that :3 Babysteps for me! Do tell me how you feel about the products, they seem awesome but I don't know if I have the money to pay $55 for that omg!"
BeautyBoxes,3dzu02,poeticlaughter77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:49 2015 UTC,Ahh I'm so jealous! I didn't get this one
BeautyBoxes,3dzu02,hervana,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:06 2015 UTC,I got this TOO! Can't wait to try it! Update us and let us know what you think!
BeautyBoxes,3dza8a,aliwhalen,6,Mon Jul 20 19:12:08 2015 UTC,I loved the design so much I thought it'd make a great mani! Posted on Laqueristas but I thought you guys might like it too 😊
BeautyBoxes,3dza8a,sarahbotts,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:35 2015 UTC,Your mani is awesome!! What nail polishes did you use? (Also did you freehand this or stamp it? - looks so good)
BeautyBoxes,3dza8a,sarahbotts,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's all free hand and was hard to do because I spent four hours in the yard beforehand and my hands were shaking like crazy! I posted all the polishes on the Reddit Laqueristas, I'll link here!"

BeautyBoxes,3dza8a,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:16 2015 UTC,You've inspired me to try out my own attempt at it!
BeautyBoxes,3dza8a,pantherluna,2,Mon Jul 20 23:37:42 2015 UTC,Yay! I hope you'll post a pic!
BeautyBoxes,3e0r2a,apprberriepie,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see the $5 one on their website, just the $15 one. What's the difference?"
BeautyBoxes,3e0r2a,mrs_sugarlips,3,Tue Jul 21 08:14:54 2015 UTC,"^ The 5 dollar bag seems to have a lot of foil packets (not bad for 5 bucks though honestly), where as the 15 dollar bag has more actual items, some of which appear to be full sized!"
BeautyBoxes,3e0r2a,imhereforthemeta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"The $5 bags will appear if you hit the button next to the different ""types"" of bag. They coded it strangely, since it seems like they mean do you want this $15 bag to be for dry skin, oily, etc., but they are all different bags. The price changes as you hit each one. HTH"
BeautyBoxes,3e0r2a,Treat_Choself,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:06 2015 UTC,"As u/Treat_Choself pointed out, I selected ""Oily/sensitive skin"" and it was only $5. I think this really is a great one-time option. If I were buying another, I would probably get the $15 bag again over the $5 just due to amount and variety (it looks like they send makeup?). I also like getting little makeup bags for storage... Also I really like to horde them."
BeautyBoxes,3e0r2a,Treat_Choself,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"FYI, for the people thinking about getting these, the $5 Dermaologica bag is also great. Some large deluxe samples and also a ton of foils. Of course I haven't gotten around to trying any of them yet so maybe I shouldn't say it is great =).  Also, the $5 dry skin and sensitive skin/rosacea concerns bags are very similar, I wouldn't get both of them. I wish I'd taken photos for you of what was in each one, but I forgot."
BeautyBoxes,3e0f1d,bookwithoutpics,4,Tue Jul 21 00:15:03 2015 UTC,"So I was super disappointed by my Spring Walmart box of foils, but was lazy and forgot to cancel. This box is so much better! I got a red Revlon lipstick, a Neutrogena hydro boost water gel, and a massive Vaseline healing serum, in addition to a few foils."
BeautyBoxes,3e0f1d,strwbrry_fields,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:00 2015 UTC,Wow that healing serum looks huge and awesome!
BeautyBoxes,3e0f1d,theAisSILENT,3,Tue Jul 21 00:36:18 2015 UTC,It is! I just tried it after a bath and I'll definitely buy more when I'm out. It's great!
BeautyBoxes,3e0f1d,apprberriepie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:34 2015 UTC,Did you get an email telling you it had shipped?
BeautyBoxes,3e0f1d,Golddigger007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"I got the shipping email about a week ago. And about two weeks ago, I got an email telling me not to panic that it hadn't shipped yet."
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,sheenathesheen,3,Mon Jul 20 20:10:55 2015 UTC,I have been subscribed for a few months and honestly I never expect much but I am pleasantly surprised every month with the products I receive.     Harvey Prince roller in Sincerely Lorde and Berry in Fire Mililani Gloss in Sweet Grapefruit Mica Lip Pot in Velvet Rose
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,sarahbotts,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:13 2015 UTC,Ayy Harvey Prince!  Honestly it looks like a decent low-cost lip sub. 3 full-sizes isn't bad.
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,iamhuxley,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:55 2015 UTC,Nice. Thinking of subscribing again. I got a full cargo gloss 3 months ago and love it.
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,cumbuttons,3,Mon Jul 20 20:43:56 2015 UTC,"Love those Lord and Berry crayons! I got a hot hot HOT pink one on my wantable bag earlier this year. It's the perfect top coat to spice up a lipstick and its very moisturizing, almost like a gloss."
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,MayaHugo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:03:26 2015 UTC,I tried it and I LOVE IT. This maybe my new favorite lip product!
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,HotTotXoXo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:06:34 2015 UTC,I got an email from them last week saying next month they are introducing newer and better bags... So I am pretty excited to see what they come up with!
BeautyBoxes,3dzidl,HotTotXoXo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:47 2015 UTC,I must have deleted it. What all did the email say? That sounds nice
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,floppyhead,9,Mon Jul 20 17:18:37 2015 UTC,Still seems like an awful lot of work for a $35 mascara
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,AnnaBreit,4,Mon Jul 20 19:27:27 2015 UTC,And how is the average consumer supposed to figure it out on their own? Isn't this the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do with every other mascara? I was always told not to pump the wand since it supposedly introduces air & bacteria into the liquid...
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,BungViper,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"""Hey guys, we have this ingenious packaging that doesn't allow air into it and keeps your mascara from drying out!  But before you can use it, you're gonna need to pump some air into it"""
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,pantherluna,6,Tue Jul 21 16:34:46 2015 UTC,Glad Boxycharm sent this out because I was convinced this was the most useless mascara in the history of the world...
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,sheenathesheen,5,Mon Jul 20 17:19:26 2015 UTC,Same here! I applied it and was the WTF is this liquid eyeliner with a mascara wand?
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,firefly62,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:40 2015 UTC,I just tried this and it's still not giving me any volume. It works better than before but it's not doing anything great. My Jordana mascara that costs $3 at walgreens is way better than this.
BeautyBoxes,3dytvm,unichan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:55:14 2015 UTC,"Mine still doesn't work, either. It literally does nothing. I think I'll email Boxycharm and see what they say because this is going right in the garbage."
BeautyBoxes,3e0554,missterious,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:59 2015 UTC,Oh man that's a much better Topbox than mine this month! That moisturizer sample is almost like something you'd get as a free sample. This month was weird - they've been having some good stuff in past months and now they just dropped the ball again.
BeautyBoxes,3e0554,DiKetian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:49 2015 UTC,"Aw I saw your post actually :( yours was one of the ones I was talking about when I said I understood how some people were disappointed.  I'm telepathically sending good vibes your way, hopefully you get an amazing box next month!"
BeautyBoxes,3e0554,DiKetian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:10 2015 UTC,Have you tried the nail polish? How is it?
BeautyBoxes,3dybsy,LauraBellz,3,Mon Jul 20 15:09:40 2015 UTC,I keep trying...but it keeps saying my CC info is wrong! I've tried three cards! UGH.   Thanks for the tip though!
BeautyBoxes,3dybsy,nightsmystic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:51:49 2015 UTC,I don't remember how theirs works. Do you have to select the card type first?
BeautyBoxes,3dybsy,nightsmystic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:41 2015 UTC,Nope. I sent a message to their help team. Hopefully it works!

BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,BlueAjah238,4,Mon Jul 20 16:56:22 2015 UTC,"I have this box -- $30 for it is a good fun deal.  It has a full size Tarte lip gloss, and the perfume oil is really nice.  I don't know if the ""$100"" necklace really adds to the value of the box though."
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,Drenkn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:22 2015 UTC,This is so tempting!!  Thanks for posting :)
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,pantherluna,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! Snagged it. I've been considering trying out the box and that coupon made me take the plunge
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,strwbrry_fields,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Oooh, snagged it!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,broken_bird,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"I just tried like 8 times, and I keep felt a message that the code is invalid. Super frustrating. I emailed them - I've been considering this box for a while, and of course I get a code that gets me to go forit and it doesn't work. If they let me know if they're out of them or something, I'll be sure to post here and let everyone know."
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,InnocuousTerror,2,Mon Jul 20 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, I tried to use it too and it says invalid.  It shows -20 next to promo code though but doesn't take it off the price...weird.  I'd definitely be interested to hear what they say."
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,radiant_eclipse,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry it didn't work for you, but frankly I feel a little less nuts because that's exactly what happened to me. I will report back as soon as I get any response!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,InnocuousTerror,2,Mon Jul 20 23:45:23 2015 UTC,"Haha don't worry, youre definitely not nuts!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,radiant_eclipse,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:19 2015 UTC,The same thing happened to me today! Thanks for sharing that it's not just my computer.
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,CPHBOSDCA,3,Tue Jul 21 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"Be careful with this company. I bought last winter's box and it took more than 3 months for them to actually cancel my sub. I tried 3 times to unsubscribe from the website, got confirmation emails, but they still tried to charge my credit card repeatedly. Emailed them several times as well and never got a response. Luckily I used the service through my credit card that generates a new # with a spending limit so they couldn't actually bill me again."
BeautyBoxes,3dyqnm,melanrawr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"Weird. When I bought this, it says on my profile that I'm not currently subscribed. Do you know if they're still going to charge me next month?"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,kmaness930,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:14 2015 UTC,I got both boxes and I'm super impressed with both of them! I'm especially excited about the dry oil in this one - it gets incredibly dry here in the winter so this will come in handy.
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,violinist452000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like their back-to-school ones are the best. Awesome! I used the oil spray immediately, it's nice!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,stlfoodie,2,Mon Jul 20 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'm always a sucker for the back-to-school Tboxes even though I'm not in school. :) I skipped out on the last few Target boxes because they didn't really interest me or seem like an awesome value.   I planned on buying/trying this mascara that retails for $5 or so anyway, so everything is just a bonus! Totally worth $5, IMO.  Target is really stepping it up with these boxes - sleek black packaging and an info card. Plus, I ordered and received this in under a week!   7 items plus a $3 off $15 purchase coupon:   • New Wet n Wild max volume plus mascara  • 3 Goody hair ties   • Cover Girl lipgloss in give me guava   • Herbal Essence dry oil spray (2.8oz)   • Yes to cucumbers towelettes (10ct)   • The Bathery pumice stone   • Hollywood fashion/dress tape (6 ct)   This lipgloss is a shimmer overload, i'll pass it along. But everything will definitely be used by me!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,Raewynrh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:44 2015 UTC,Make sure you check the expiration on the coupon- I remember last time that I accidentally let mine expire because it wasn't good for all that long.
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,Raewynrh,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reminder! What's up with these boxes and expiring coupons? I literally had to run out the door to use the Walmart Real Techniques one. Luckily, this one is good for about a month - 8/23/15. Not bad!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:49:09 2015 UTC,I really like the box but I'm definitely passing along the lip gloss too.   It reminds me of the vanilla frosting Lip Smackers gloss I wore in middle school and the glitter feels soooo gritty.
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,Raewynrh,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:09 2015 UTC,"Ew! I didn't even bother opening it, I'm glad I didn't! I figured someone else will appreciate it new and untested. I guess we need glitterbomb lips going back to school? Who knew!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:51:31 2015 UTC,It's pretty over more opaque lipstick with that gold shift but the texture is rooooouuuugggghhhhh!  I tried it over maybelline's touch of spice and divine wine.  And it was beautiful but I still prefer matte lips. :(
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,Raewynrh,3,Mon Jul 20 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you got a bad batch or something because mine has no noticeable gritty texture at all.  It's actually pretty hydrating, not sticky, and it's definitely glossy and shimmery but not overtly glittery.  I have another shade from the line and it's the same formula.  I actually really like it!  EmilyNoel83 is wearing this gloss in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUOIgx3tqU"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,pantherluna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:36:53 2015 UTC,Oh boo! Maybe I'll try another color. I like that it's not sticky. I'd use one of it felt smoother!
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,pantherluna,2,Tue Jul 21 07:13:45 2015 UTC,"I know they have some shades that are a creme and no glitter, but they are sheer so don't expect the shade in the bottle to be the same on your lips. I don't do gloss often but the fact that it's not sticky is the best!"
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,aliwhalen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:18:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my biggest pet peeve with lip gloss. I HATE when my lips stick together.
BeautyBoxes,3dyp2u,aliwhalen,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"The Wet N Wild mascara is new?  I've seen that packaging around for a while now, unless it's a new formula?"
BeautyBoxes,3dzmst,gummyboars,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:56 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the one pic being not rotated correctly, can't fix it on mobile. I love my box! I was super excited about the stila lipsticks and i am thrilled with the color I got, which was beso. It's a very true red which I don't have atm so it was nice to get one. I got the amika dry shampoo last month and absolutely love it so I'm glad to get another amika product this month. The Marcelle BB cream may be a bit dark (see the swatch) but by the end of this month it should work for me after a couple beach trips. I'm a bit skeptical of the hair and body wash combo but I'll give it a shot, and it smells really nice.   I've loved my boxes from the past four months when I decided to resub and this month is no exception, so yay :)  Edit: the Vasanti cleanser has a gritty texture which I'm nervous of since I haven't used a physical exfoliant on my face in a long time, only chemical like Stridex pads, but I'll try it since I like all the skincare products I've gotten from BB lately"
BeautyBoxes,3dzmst,honeydot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"The vasanti cleanser is my favourite exfoliator - its a little gritty, but very fine, so it's lovely for removing dead skin cells. It might be a little harsh for really sensitive skin, but I find it's really improved my skin over a few weeks of use (I got it in my UK birchbox a few months ago)"
BeautyBoxes,3dzmst,honeydot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"You know, I tried it last night and my face has really never been this soft. Awesome to hear it shows results over a few weeks too."

BeautyBoxes,3dzny8,pajamasinbananas,2,Tue Jul 21 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"you can still use many of the codes to buy stuff in the shop, but you can't use discounts for a subscription unless you're a new subscriber"
BeautyBoxes,3dzny8,Amplitude,2,Tue Jul 21 15:11:04 2015 UTC,"I've heard of people canceling and then re-subscribing within the same month, using a code.  Is that something that works?   Are you able to keep everything associated with your account, like points?"
BeautyBoxes,3dzny8,Amplitude,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:19 2015 UTC,Some of them are good if you place an order for full sized items (the ones with percentages usually) and some are good if you cancel your sub and re-sub (the dollar off the monthly box).
BeautyBoxes,3dzny8,misinformerstar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:30 2015 UTC,"Are you able to keep everything associated with your account, like points?     Everything would be reinstated exactly the same way, except I'd get a free $5 in points?"

BeautyBoxes,3dw7m3,apprberriepie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:28:40 2015 UTC,Okay thanks! I didn't know if it was just me with the problem. They must just be running behind or something.
BeautyBoxes,3dw7m3,1Marshall91,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:33:29 2015 UTC,No points here either.
BeautyBoxes,3dw7m3,bribaybee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:34 2015 UTC,Just checked thanks to this post! No pointa yet and I want to use them on Stila!! It's 12:30 Pacific time for me.
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,goldknives,6,Sun Jul 19 21:35:23 2015 UTC,"Nope, you don't get disqualified. Doing all the badges just makes you more likely to get chosen in the future, but you don't have to do them and you can still receive boxes."
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,stumblepretty,2,Sun Jul 19 21:36:12 2015 UTC,Thank you! Will it count if I only do a few steps from each badge?
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,pantherluna,4,Sun Jul 19 22:06:29 2015 UTC,i rarely ever do stuff for the badges and i've gotten 5 boxes in the last year
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,c0reyann,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:10 2015 UTC,No you don't have to do them all but they help you get selected in the future.  I don't you tube so that's one I always miss if they have that as a badge and I've been chosen again.
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,asheliimnotatree,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:57 2015 UTC,"It doesn't ""disqualify"" you. However, I really think influenster is only in all this so we keep our badges active by providing reviews every five days. So keeping your badges up to date with reviews is the most important thing I would say"
BeautyBoxes,3dvhke,LoWoo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:17:13 2015 UTC,I just signed up yesterday and completed my snaps and have been trying to earn badges. I'm still not 100% sure how all of this works.. Basically I just try to complete badges so I get boxes??
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,Brompton_Cocktail,8,Sun Jul 19 14:12:23 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer Boxycharm.  I just cancelled my glossy box subscription because I was getting too many deluxe size samples.  Boxycharm and glossy box cost the same, but Boxycharm is 90% full size with occasional travel size/sample size, glossy box is 90% travel size with frequent deluxe size samples.  Glossy box is also often brands that I've never heard of (so I have no reference for the quality) AND the retail prices listed often seem extremely high for what the quality feels like.  The final straw was when I got a mini size Orly polish. Really? For a $21/mo box, you couldn't spring for the full-size drugstore nail polish? Really?  Just my two cents.    I have been interested in trying meme box because Korean beauty products seem fascinating - but I haven't taken the plunge yet..."
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,OnMyBehalf,3,Sun Jul 19 16:20:27 2015 UTC,I ended up very confused so I just ordered wantable. Do you know if memebox is only skincare? I want to try Korean skincare but their face products wouldn't work for my skin tone
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,OnMyBehalf,2,Sun Jul 19 17:32:30 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what box you get. Part of what interests me is that you can purchase specific boxes one-off if the products interest you.  I think you can also just do monthly subscription type thing... not 100% sure, I might be confusing it with beautique which is similar."
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,silverpixiefly,2,Sun Jul 19 18:04:21 2015 UTC,Wantable is an amazing box.  You really get your money's worth.
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,beedobeedobeedo,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:41 2015 UTC,Big AB fan here. I'd go with either their Starter box or the cosrx one if you're feeling riskier. What's nice is they have a great return policy (90 days!)
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,HotTotXoXo,5,Sun Jul 19 22:18:56 2015 UTC,Boxycharm is better for more make up of those two options. You can see some great reviews on the mysubscriptionaddiction website.
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,luvdmb36,3,Sun Jul 19 14:15:25 2015 UTC,Thanks! I didn't even know that existed
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,luvdmb36,2,Sun Jul 19 14:16:49 2015 UTC,"Dude. I just got the Allure box, and it is BY FAR the best out of the Ipsy and Birchboxes I've gotten.  I love EVERYTHING in the box, and even though I am giving two items to my sister, I'd use them if I didn't think she'd love them even more.  I wish I would have gotten in on Allure sooner!"
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,luvdmb36,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:09 2015 UTC,What kind of products do they send? I've never heard of the allure box   Ipsy and birchbox ALWAYS sent me at least one face product way too light for my skin
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,lizlemonaid,2,Sun Jul 19 21:31:33 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what is normal--but I got an Este Lauder night eye serum (which I already use and love) and mascara; a setting mist with rosemary; some ponytail holders (that I LOVE); some Oscar Blandt dry hair spray and some Bumble and Bumble hair serum.  A little bit of everything--I LOVE it!
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:38:41 2015 UTC,Wow that sounds amazing! Especially the Oscar blandi. How much per month is the box?
BeautyBoxes,3du3zu,asheliimnotatree,2,Sun Jul 19 21:44:35 2015 UTC,$15!!!
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,victoriaweaver29,5,Sun Jul 19 13:07:41 2015 UTC,"Things to know about Ipsy:   They have great customer service. They have a lot of repeat brands and item types (like lots of nude eyeshadows and eyeliners). They will send you items you specifically said you don't want. Often. Even if you poorly review them every time. It is only $10/month with average values being in the $45-55 range. Expect a lot of drugstore quality items. They have a points system that is nearly useless, and when items you can get show up, they are sold out before you can get them. Within minutes sometimes. They will constantly try to get you to whore them out on Facebook to all your friends and family. CONSTANTLY. They will hold your reviewing points hostage until you do so. Just set your post to ""private"" so you don't have to deal with it on your page if you don't want to annoy everyone as a billboard.  They will send out some really nice mid-end products from brands like Too Faced, Smashbox, and Tarte. Not everyone gets them. The popular beauty bloggers ALWAYS seem to get them though, so don't use their boxes as representatives of what you will get. Come here and look through the unboxings here for a good idea of what you should expect.   Feel free to add more info ladies!"
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,mrs_sugarlips,3,Mon Jul 20 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"They do not hold your reviewing points hostage O_O?  When your review thing comes up and it asks you to share/write a message on facebook, there is a little button underneath that is a slider that says ""ON"". Click that, and it switches to off. Then hit continue. Your points are added and you didn't whore Ipsy out to your friends and family. You have to hit the switch for every review, but it's better than sharing. I've never had to share a thing on facebook for ipsy, yet I see people mad about it all the time. Do you guys not see the switch or something?  Completely agree with the rest of the list though. Especially on the last one."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,Ninamaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:38 2015 UTC,"When I was subscribed you were given an option of ""see your stuff early IF you share on Facebook."" ""Advertise for us on FB for MORE points."" Like, the points from reviews were so few that to try and accumulate any you have to share stuff on Facebook. Then I would have to go hide the stuff I posted to not bombard my friends/family/coworkers. That alone is enough to make me annoyed enough to drop them.   Of course, their business model could have changed by now. I had them a year ago."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:02 2015 UTC,No I'm pretty sure you're right.  Points/sharing seemed to change when the website changed.
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:11 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this is a new development.  Around the time of the site re-design, I think the points system was overhauled and a bunch of things changed.  We used to only get like 40 points a month from all the reviewing and sharing, now it's a ton more.  I'm like 85% sure that we used to HAVE to share to FB in order to get more points.  There wasn't a switch before the site re-design.  Of course I had it automatically set that anything shared to FB from ipsy is posted to ""only me"" so I didn't care and didn't have to go around deleting things.  But I think people who had ipsy before the revamp are just accustomed to the FB sharing thing."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:05:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for putting it all like this! It's super easy to read through. I don't think the quality will bother me because I don't usually wear much high quality make up.   You're wonderful for putting all this info together for me!
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"Glad you found it useful! I subbed to them for only 3 months, but I ultimately just liked some of the other subs out there better."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:35:05 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing what you liked about the others more?
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,AmberOrchid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:54:47 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, I posted something on this the other day so forgive the copy pasta:  Cheap boxes:  IPSY: Subbed for 3 months. Only received 2 items I was interested in using (one of which was a nail polish from a brand I regularly use). Got a lot of really cheap quality brands. Unsubbed because i was positive the quiz doesn't matter/change what you get, the points system is ridiculous, and they want you to whore them out on Facebook at every single opportunity.  Sample Society: Subbed 3 months. Received a couple of decent items, but they were generally low-value boxes and they would send some really, really bad stuff sometimes. Like, L'oreal shampoo bad. A lot of really tiny perfumes. They would advertise items that ended up not being offered. It was horrible. They do have a ""mystery box"" that is 15 samples they sometimes sell that is well worth the price though and I've ordered 3 of them with 100% satisfaction.  Mid-price boxes:  Glossybox: Meh. I tried for 3 months (that's my ""I'll give it a try"" timeline). I got high quality items and the boxes had a high value, especially considering I got it at a discount. However, the items I got were just completely underwhelming to me. I think Glossybox is probably really good for some people. I'm not one of them. It had a mix of skincare, makeup, nailpolish, hair items. CS is a bit passive aggressive in my experience.  Boxycharm: I had subbed to them for 3 months, then unsubbed, and have come back for now 2 more months so far. I like Boxycharm. The value is good. The products are generally good. I use a good amount of what I get and I like what I use. They have a decent points system (charms) but since they redid their website it still isn't up and running yet. In the 3 months I subbed to them before though, I got enough charms for a full-size mascara. I only stopped subbing to them because I had two other boxes I preferred and was getting in too much stuff. I decided to drop one, and get Boxycharm back.  BeautyFix: Sigh. i subbed for 12 months. Lately they have been dropping the ball though so I just unsubbed this week. If you like trying a lot of skincare and hair products, it's really the best one to get. They used to do a better mix of makeup/skincare/haircare/ tools/perfume/nails. Really, an all-encompassing box. This month though, they sent out a ton of tiny tubes of samples (instead of full-size like normal), and they have a pretty solid history of sending out a medium shade complexion product to 100% of their subscribers regardless of their skin tone. I'm going to watch them for the next 3 months to decide if I want to resub or not. I really like them when they have a good month, but my God, when they have a bad month, it's horrible.  High-price box:  Wantable Makeup: MY FAVORITE. I LOVE Wantable and sing its praises wherever I can. It is more expensive than the other boxes ($40/month) and you get 4 full-size items, and the boxes generally have retail values from $80-100 and it is 100% customizable. AND THEY LISTEN TO YOUR QUIZ. If you tell them no bronzers and they send you one, they send you a replacement item. The quiz is comprehensive, and you can actually return items if you don't like them for a partial refund (prorated from the retail costs). If you don't return anything, they give you a $4 credit for the next month, so in reality, my boxes only cost $36. If you have a friend signup with your referral, they give you a $10 credit in addition to the $4. The biggest thing to know about them though, is the brands are generally (not always) small/indie brands that sell in high-end boutiques. I've never heard of most of them before. That said, the quality is always amazing. Here  is a running album of the items I get from them every month. I keep it to give people a good idea of what Wantable offers.  When I look at my daily use, I would say Wantable is the top for most useful items, followed by BeautyFix. Then comes Boxycharm. I'm hoping I can get BeautyFix again in the future, assuming they don't keep sending out shit. If I do, I'll drop Boxy again because BeautyFix+Wantable is the perfect combo of makeup/skin/hair that I could possibly need."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,vtarcher33,4,Mon Jul 20 02:58:37 2015 UTC,"If you're in the U.S. then you just pay ten bucks a month and that includes shipping. You get 4-5 beauty related samples and a bag. Occasionally there are full size products. My bags are well worth it to me and I've gotten to try new things that I would have never purchased. Ipsy is a great starter bag but I would also recommend BirchBox. Their samples are smaller but they are usually higher end products. Birchbox also has an amazing points system that gets you even more. Personally I have them both, and the Walmart beauty box, and fortune cookie soap... I may have a problem >.>"

BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,AnnaBreit,3,Mon Jul 20 07:46:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, everything Amber said, and I just wanted to add a little bit about their points. You can gain Ipsy points for reviewing the items you recieve and for sharing your glam bag on social media. These allow you to ""buy"" a sample from a select few on the Ipsy page, and those samples change out probably weekly (give or take.) If you purchase an extra sample with your points it will show up in your next month's Ipsy bag. They also have three deals a week: they will sell products on their site, three different ones a week, for a great value (usually much cheaper than where you'll find it in stores) plus no tax or shipping. That's all extra stuff not necessary to buying the monthly bag. Pertaining to the bag subscription: they will automatically charge you every month until you cancel the sub. When you first sign up you'll be put on the ""waiting list"" where they ask you to share their link in your facebook page to get off the waiting list. These links don't always work, so if they don't, you just email them and explain that the links to get off the waitlist aren't working and their customer service reps will take you right off the waitlist and you'll get your bags. :) so sorry if that sounds like a handful, it's not, I swear! (I just type too much lol) It's all super easy to navigate, all a pinch :)"
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,pantherluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for all that great info! And especially about getting off the wait list! That's definitely good to know too!
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,OnMyBehalf,3,Mon Jul 20 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"I just received my first ipsy box. I signed up towards the end of June and was placed on the ""waiting"" list. I started the required posting process to remove myself from ""the list"" but ended up calling their bluff and not posting anything. I still got my box for July. There's no list. They want the money and the free advertising. No, no ipsy! It almost turned me off from them bc I HATE that crap. I will give them a few months to make up for it... Just sayin'."
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,sleeplessMUA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's kinda what I'm wondering now too. I've done the skip the wait thing, and it's still showing up as me being on the wait list, so I don't know. We'll see in August!"
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:52 2015 UTC,Ipsy is doing a no wait list for 48 hours starting today :-D
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,sleeplessMUA,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:33 2015 UTC,"I would suggest checking out the blog ""My Subscription Addiction"" - she gets a ton of sub boxes and reviews them each month.  You can look through the last several months of ipsy bags, Birchboxes, or any other box and see if it's something you might like.   ipsy is great for starting out.  You always get 5 items and a makeup bag, usually 1-3 makeup items, a hair item, a skin item, maybe a tool every once in a while.  ipsy mainly does brands that are at the drugstore or are drugstore price/quality, but each month there are a couple higher end products that you might get (last month was a Tarte bronzer, the month before there was a Too Faced Melted lipstick, a Smashbox primer, an IT cosmetics brow pencil).  Keep in mind that you're definitely not guaranteed to get these higher end products, so it can be pretty disappointing some months.  As for the point system, ipsy's is crap.  You get points for reviewing and sharing on Facebook so having a Facebook is pretty much a requirement if you want to redeem your points for anything (you can set it to share to ""only me"" so your friends won't see it, but it's still kind of annoying).  So you spend months racking up points, just to spend them on one little thing that may or may not be worth it.  Things also sell out very quickly, and it can take weeks for them to put anything up. Birchbox is the same price, and IMO so much better.  You pay $10 and get 5-7 items.  You then review each item, each review earns you $1 to spend in the Birchbox shop, plus if you share the box on Facebook or Twitter you get another $1.  So in the best months when you get 7 items, you basically only paid $2 for the box because you're getting $8 back to spend.  You can go to Birchbox.com right now and look through the shop.  I've discovered so many HG items through Birchbox and I get the full size for free or pay very little out of pocket thanks to the amazing point system.  I've been with Birchbox for over a year now and I've earned back over $100 to spend in the shop!"
BeautyBoxes,3dtynl,pantherluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"I also prefer Birchbox. Samples are smaller but better, and their point system can't be beat."

BeautyBoxes,3dthic,abstracthalo,2,Sun Jul 19 08:17:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize it until now that the Jouer tinted moisturizer I got was under the perfume.   I have tried everything except the shampoo/conditioner/serum.   The tinted moisturizer was the right shade, but wrong undertone. I walked out of the bathroom and my fiance was like ""Dude, you look like something from the Simpsons"" so that was that. The Supergoop stuff is nice. I used it when I ran errands today. No sunburn, so can't complain. The lipstick wears like most liquid ones do for me. Bit drying, but not too bad. That perfume smelled like old grandma smell. Not good.   I did contact Birchbox to express that I'm a bit disappointed I've gotten shampoo and conditioner 3 months in a row, especially since I have set so I don't get much hair stuff. They enrolled me in a beta program and warned that I'll lose ""discovery"" by doing it. I was nice and did point out that I realize that it's pretty random, but three months in a row is really hard to swallow."
BeautyBoxes,3dthic,pajamasinbananas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:22:21 2015 UTC,"What do they mean, you'll lose ""discovery""?   What's the beta program like? You choose what type of sample you get or something? Sounds exciting! Maybe we'll all get to do something like that someday!"
BeautyBoxes,3dthic,pantherluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's a more expanded profile where it breaks down products and you get to say whether you want more or less of them. Like it will have categories for blush, bronzer, mascara, etc etc. I don't have it, this is just based off of the description someone else gave a few months ago. I think they mean that you miss out on the ""discovery"" of new products that you wouldn't have considered before...I.e. Maybe there's a HG shampoo and conditioner out there for you, but you won't discover it because you said you didn't want any more shampoo/conditioner. Just a guess though."
BeautyBoxes,3dthic,pajamasinbananas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:12:36 2015 UTC,Ohhh - makes a lot of sense. I want to try that! I hope the beta goes well!

Bella goes on and wears amazingly. I could hardly believe it was the same product when I tried on Venezia. It's feathers and settles very quickly and is just not a good lipstick.
BeautyBoxes,3drarj,teresatt07,3,Sat Jul 18 22:12:30 2015 UTC,I felt the same way. Venezia even seemed kinda shimmery to me. Too bad bella isn't flattering on me but I love mixing it with venezia! It's a more wearable bright melon shade xP

BeautyBoxes,3drarj,awkwardsoul,2,Sun Jul 19 11:14:36 2015 UTC,I wasn't happy with it either. I love the colour of Venezia but it was streaky and flaked off in a few hours.

BeautyBoxes,3drarj,sarfisc,3,Sun Jul 19 02:23:01 2015 UTC,"In addition to some kind of lip balm, try applying it over a clear lip liner.  I have the Urban Decay Ozone one (from Ipsy) and find that it fills in lines better and protects my lips from some of the drying effects (at least for things like OCC Lip Tars).  I haven't tried with that shade yet though."

Edit: After I posted this I checked my email, and I literally JUST got an email saying I'm in for the Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs voxbox.  Just a virtual one, gives a coupon, but if you complete the badge, you get a Sally Hansen product or an Influenster tote"
BeautyBoxes,3ds0kd,pantherluna,2,Sat Jul 18 22:11:35 2015 UTC,I hope this helps. :) How to know if you are actually getting a #voxbox!
BeautyBoxes,3ds0kd,micabebecca,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:32:47 2015 UTC,I just got a quiz and I know its something from Sephora so I'm so pumped! I think it's a primer based on the questions but I hope it's a few things. Basically you won't know if you're getting it until they tell you. So be patient.

BeautyBoxes,3dqte4,MsWhimsy,3,Sat Jul 18 15:48:04 2015 UTC,So this is actually really easy :)  Go to Michaels or any craft store and buy a pack of magnetic adhesive sheets.  The ones I bought were a pack of 4 for about $5.  Take one sheet (or one sheet and part of another depending on how big the sheets are) and stick it to the bottom of the box.  Then take the other sheets and you can cut out little squares or circles to stick on the bottom of the nail polishes or whatever you want to put in the palette.  Voila!
BeautyBoxes,3dqte4,pantherluna,2,Sat Jul 18 16:13:50 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I was experiencing a total brain fart.  I totally forgot magnets are magnetic...to each other. I have everything I need.   Although I was going to use little nickle sized self adhesive magnets but I think I like the sheet idea better. We'll see.  I was wracking my brain to see if I could find a bolt/washer that was the right size or a large flathead nail that I could detattch the head from the pokey part.    Ever hear of KISS?   Keep it simple stupid.  I should follow my own advice.  Many thank yous!
BeautyBoxes,3dqte4,pajamasinbananas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:57:55 2015 UTC,Such a good idea!! I really want to do this now. What will you stick your boxes to? Do you have a magnet board?
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,walkingonmainst,20,Sun Jul 19 04:53:58 2015 UTC,"I can't speak much for the others, as my experiences were mediocre, but julep is a rip off. Poor quality, very small amounts in their bottles. Their polish is a higher prices per ml than Chanel polish. There no way their quality is better. I've had polish by them that took sooo long to dry, like 5 coats to get opacity. Anywho that's just my 2 cents!"
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,fluxusisus,7,Sun Jul 19 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I would have to agree, julep is plain terrible. They have the best color choices but their product is not very good ; it very easily chips and peels. I signed up because I was super excited to try  all the pretty colors. I bought a bunch with all the coupons that are always coming out. I noticed the amount is small and gets all  dry quick. Now I have a ton I don't want to use. It's pointless because it will come right off. I do not recommend them."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,prettycat32,4,Sun Jul 19 08:38:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe start out with just Boxycharm and Birchbox, that seems like a good mix. Boxycharm will take care of lots of your makeup and you'll love Birchbox's point system. Not as much makeup but I'm obsessed with Birchbox. I think even with two boxes it would help your spending habits! You get to try at least 10 products a month and then try to limit yourself to buying one full-size a month?"
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,pajamasinbananas,4,Sun Jul 19 08:40:00 2015 UTC,"I actually love julep nail polishes but I never pay full price for them. I skip every monthly box and wait for polishes to come on sale, or I purchase from the secret store. They also usually have good promo codes like a free polish when you spend $15 or $20 dollars."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,BreZblue,6,Sun Jul 19 15:23:20 2015 UTC,"There's a great sub called r/MakeupRehab if you ever decide that you want tips on cutting down on spending.  If you really want to try high-end products, ipsy is not the bag for you.  They have a couple high-end things each month, but not everyone gets them.  It's mostly drugstore brands/drugstore quality, although overall the products are completely fine (I'm mainly a drugstore girl anyway).  Birchbox has smaller samples, but higher end brands, and then you redeem your points for higher end brands.  Also, consider signing up for Influenster!  It's free, they just occasionally send you a brief survey to see if you qualify for a box, then if you get it, all you're required to do is complete a post-box quiz.  There are extra things to do on the website for the chance at winning more things, but you don't have to do them.  A few months ago they sent out a full size YSL mascara!  Edit:  Oops, sorry just realized you are already getting ipsy.  I thought you were signing up for all of those at the same time."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,pantherluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:56:48 2015 UTC,"However, I have never heard of influenster, I'll be signing up for that now!"
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,pantherluna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:25 2015 UTC,"I like ipsy mainly for the bags, hahah. And occasionally they will send a product that I enjoy, but seriously.. those bags are awesome. I also like how they have you fill out the quiz, even though I am almost positive they pay NO attention to the results when they send the bags out. Boxycharm is the one I prefer of the two, and from what I have read birchbox seems to be the most similar to Boxycharm."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,BunsMunchHay,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I don't exactly want to cut down on spending. Lol. I hate to sound like a spoiled brat, but my parents pay for my bills/phone/clothes and makeup from places such as Sephora/Ulta. With my job, I usually just purchase my monthly boxes, gas, and I also subscribe to the Honest diaper bundle for my best friend.   Weird thing - I don't really wear makeup too often. Well, I do.. but with my job I'm up way too early to even care what I look like. I'm normally just the go to person when my friends need their makeup done. I may just have a hoarding problem I think. I guess most girls have shoes or purses, I have makeup."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,HeyMissW,0,Mon Jul 20 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that even if you have the money, shopping and spending money can actually be an addiction just like gambling or caffeine or substance use.  Having a large collection because you frequently do makeup on others or because you review makeup frequently (like Youtubers/bloggers) is one thing, but hoarding is an actual medical problem.  Not saying that's you, I'm just saying there are really helpful subreddits here if you're ever interested in doing that."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,HeyMissW,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:44 2015 UTC,"Get the $3 Julep welcome box before signing up. I went from 8/10 excited to 2/10. I expected to be blown away by the quality ($14!), but the polish quality is inconsistent, and the colors are darker and less vibrant on the nail than in the bottle/in photos."
BeautyBoxes,3dt3va,doablysad,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"I've never had a bad Julep polish. I've been subscribed for a year and some months and while I have skipped some months (sometimes I need the $25 elsewhere), I have not had a bad experience. I had to cancel my sub once while I was still in college (again, money) and CS couldn't have been nicer about it. I really like that I can customize my boxes to get the polishes I want instead of what's picked for me. The Secret Store sales can be pretty great too - they even had a $1 polish sale!   I understand that everyone has a different experience with Julep. I love nail polish and I change mine 1-2x weekly. The thing is, Julep doesn't have just nail polish. They also have makeup, skincare, and tools. I have a lot of products from them that are great quality, and I got them in my monthly boxes. If you buy outside a sale or a box reveal, yes, $14 for a bottle of polish is crazy. That's why you check for sales and wait for boxes.   In each box, you typically get: 2 polishes and a full size makeup product. My box (Classic with a Twist) is set up that way. There's a box that gives you 3 polishes and a box that gives you only makeup. They usually give you a little bit of candy in your box too, and you can choose add-ons to go with your box.   Have fun choosing your boxes :)"
BeautyBoxes,3dpl82,Ninamaroo,3,Sat Jul 18 05:32:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the cute swatches. :)
BeautyBoxes,3dpl82,sarahsway,3,Sat Jul 18 07:55:59 2015 UTC,"Ahh. I wanted that Tarte bronzer so badly!  But I'm obsessed with Tarte in general. A few months ago when Boxycharm send the full-size Tarte Maracuja Bronzing Oil, I was absolutely thrilled."
BeautyBoxes,3dpl82,walkingonmainst,2,Sat Jul 18 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"I completely forgot to add a review of the yourMinerals transparent setting powder from Boxycharm, but I haven't been able to try it other than on my hand yet. It is acting like a basic HD powder so far, just took a flash picture with it on my hand and didn't see any of that white powdery streak look I've seen on some celebrities who wear HD powder XD. So that's a plus.   Overall I'm very happy with both Ipsy and Boxycharm this month. I changed my quiz up from Ipsy and made it so that I didn't want really any skincare from them, mainly makeup, and this month was no skincare in it! So...MAYBE they listened? Or I was just lucky, I don't know. I like it though, and the bag is adorable. Boxycharm was great too, I really like the mascara and hairspray, and I LOVE when beauty tools are in boxes, so the brush is nice to have :D  Apologies for the huge ass pictures (especially of my eye, kind of creepy..) but I was way too lazy after doing the descriptions and titles and uploading blabla to resize them. Me right now."

As for the ofra pencil it worked for me when I had dark brown hair, and now that I have black hair it still works for me, but I have such dense brows as it is, so your miles may vary. I actually love it, got it in an ipsy bag a little while ago."
BeautyBoxes,3dpl82,OkayKK,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"I received the exact same ipsy bag. The bronzer IS way too dark, but isn't that perfume just lovely?"
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,emmadilemma,5,Sat Jul 18 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"Full size mascara 2 months in a row? Not really worth it.  Ugh. That sounded so bitchy.  What I would really like is some thought given to variety. I would like to know the intention behind the bonus items plan. It hasn't been made clear at all, and I want to know the benefit for both the end users as well as the companies whose items are being given away so cheaply as well as the benefit for birchbox. Are these leftovers from past runs that didnt sell well or are they an introduction to new products? Is there a selection of products or just a couple of things each month that not a lot of thought goes into.   So, my flippant comment from earlier definitely didn't convey my depth of curiosity and minor irritation."
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,lynnduh,2,Sat Jul 18 05:12:28 2015 UTC,This month was my fourth month getting the upgrade and the third month of getting a full size mascara. I understand that there is probably some deal between the brand and birchbox that dictates what they can send out for that price but it's annoying to not have any variety. I ended up cancelling the upgrade for now.
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,pantherluna,2,Sat Jul 18 13:07:03 2015 UTC,"It definitely makes sense to be annoyed about multiple full size mascaras.  I've never panned a full size one because despite wearing it almost every day, there's still product left when it expires or starts to go funky.  DS samples all the way!"
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,pantherluna,2,Sat Jul 18 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"YES! That's my thing - there's literally always some left.  And it's like, -7 cents to make apparently because EVERYONE has one and gives it away!   http://i.imgur.com/Nb8wryw.jpg  This is after getting rid of the old ones."
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,lpb0004,2,Sat Jul 18 17:49:43 2015 UTC,Dang!  I just destashed my old full sizes and I just have a hoard of deluxe samples...like...9 or 10.  Plus a voucher to get a free full size at Sephora which I feel like I'll never redeem because I'll never finish these samples...

I got the Mally Beauty Liquid Blush last month and some Pop eye pigment, and this month, I got the same things you got. I thought that this month was really worth it. I love the Laura Gellar baked bronzer, and I really like this mascara. I understand, though. If I got a full sized mascara two months in a row, I'd be annoyed too."
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,BunsMunchHay,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:11:14 2015 UTC,"What box is this? I see you're complaining about the mascara, but other than that.. I want it!  I'm only with Ipsy and Boxycharm. Someone mentioned birchbox, but I always shyed away from them because I wasn't interested in what they seemed to be selling - however, if this is birchbox, I'll be their new customer! (I lose mascara entirely too much, so that's not too much of a problem for me.. lol)"
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,walkingonmainst,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, sorry, this is the upgraded Birchbox. And I feel bad about complaining, it really is a great box.  I'm so happy because the last two months were kinda meh.  This is totally birchbox!"
BeautyBoxes,3dpj9a,Celladoore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"So wait, they have two separate boxes - a regular and an upgraded? Sorry, I'm a bit of a newbie. I always seemed to notice a ton of hair product and very little makeup in Birchboxes (at least according to the reviews) and I literally wear my hair in a bun everyday, so they never interested me.   Are the upgraded boxes always avaliable, or is it just a limited time thing?   Thanks!"
BeautyBoxes,3drum6,keeeunjung,2,Sat Jul 18 21:16:55 2015 UTC,I got the same brush in mine this month. I really like it for using cream shadows over the finger I normally use.   How does this compare with other Wantable boxes you get? Mine this month was pretty good.
BeautyBoxes,3drum6,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:03:28 2015 UTC,"This is my first makeup box from them. I'm fairly happy w/ everything. That eyeshadow stick... I swatched it and wasn't terribly impressed but then I used it and I really like it! I'd like another color too lol! They had a duo on groupon but it's sold out lol.   The mascara is kind of clumpy just looking at it but it applied decently; Diorshow Addict It Lash applied thinner coats for a more precise, delicate look. Tarte Lights Camera Lashes is slightly more clumpy than Dior. Those two are my go to mascaras although I do really like the Perricone no mascara mascara for bottom lashes when I do it. My lashes look ok but it hasn't rubbed off which is quite common for me unfortunately.   I swatched the tint and it didn't even have a hint of color so I think I might have to return it sadly. I was hoping for something nice like the Becca shimmer souffle but so far no such luck, although I haven't done it on my cheeks yet.   I was thinking about trying the brush out for a glitter or something and pat it on but I'll have to try it out for a cream shadow!   What did you get? Did you post pics of your box?"
BeautyBoxes,3drum6,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I got mine in a few weeks ago and posted it. I ended up with a Ferro mineral blush, the eyeshadow brush, a Chella mascara, and a Makeup for Real liquid lipstick. It was a good month and I'm happy about everything I got!"
BeautyBoxes,3drum6,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry the pics/swatches are not next to each other. I didn't think of it until after, and then I didn't know how to rearrange the order on imgur. I've never taken pics and written a blog post as quickly as I did today about them! I was so excited! lol! About to do a FOTD w/ my new goodies!   edit: also there was no way for me to verify the price of the brush b/c I couldn't find where to buy it so the value was really only $70.00. I put that in the comments in the album but for some reason it's not showing up."
BeautyBoxes,3drum6,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the brush wasn't worth $0, so I guess there is that.   Also, I highly suggest retaking your quiz every month with their featured products in mind. Then at the end of the quiz, ask for what you want.They will give it to you if they have it."
BeautyBoxes,3dru6o,walkingonmainst,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:21 2015 UTC,"Julep is alright. Try it for one month with the discount code and see if your mom likes their formula. It's not a great deal for the volume, I would actually recommend getting her their very frequent mystery boxes instead. Those are usually 4-5 polishes plus extras for $25, vs 3 polishes for $20 (or is it $25 now?) on a monthly subscription. Their makeup and other beauty products are hit or miss, some I love and some I hate.  Other nail polish subs are Rainbow Honey (indie glitterbombs for the most part) and Square Hue. I don't have personal experience with either of those. Rainbow Honey is generally raved about, but it is for a very particular style."
BeautyBoxes,3dru6o,lacqueratorie,2,Sat Jul 18 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"There are a few:   Color Me Monthly - 1 for $7 monthly (their own brand) Square Hue - 3 for $20 monthly (their own brand) Julep - $25/month ($20/month if you sign up for 3 months) has the ability to select colours from a preset list, they also have the option of getting some makeup instead of a polish or pausing your sub if you're getting too much polish.    Personally, I love nail polish but don't subscribe to any boxes. I'm really picky about my colours and often don't like the colour selection for a specific month, so I find it's too much wasted product for me. What I do instead is wait for Zoya sales, it's good quality polish and much cheaper than the sub boxes when on sale. For example, right now they are running a promotion that essentially gives you 6 polishes for $25. http://www.zoya.com/content/category/Zoya-Nail-Polish-Color-Cubes.html"
BeautyBoxes,3dru6o,starry101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:14 2015 UTC,I used to subscribe to Square Hue. It's only nail polish though. It's 3 full sized bottles for about $20. I loved it. The only reason I stopped was because I needed to save money.

BeautyBoxes,3dojud,SpaceTortoise,22,Fri Jul 17 23:31:11 2015 UTC,"The mystery pack is never worth $10, it is always a rip off if you actually purchase it. The mystery packs are recycled products from past boxes. Because I have never even seen or heard of this brand my assumption is that product sample is really old/wasn't stored correctly and has evaporated out and that is what is left. I cannot image that was what the original sample looked like. I wouldn't use it... and send an email to birchbox, their customer service is excellent.  By the way I think the product is an eye gel:  https://www.birchbox.com/shop/jules-and-esther-cucumber-eye-gel"
BeautyBoxes,3dojud,amawhy,8,Fri Jul 17 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"Haven't even touch it, this is exactly the amount I got in that small container. I signed up to birchbox to recieve fair samples so I can actually try a product a few times, I think this is suppose to be a face cream? In not sure since the letters have fade off a bit from the container but that's not enough for not even one use, since I apply face stuff on my neck too."
BeautyBoxes,3dojud,Raewynrh,14,Fri Jul 17 23:34:19 2015 UTC,Yikes. That's really bad. Call customer service and they will make it right. That's some serious bullshit but I've never had them be anything but awesome when I call in to complain

BeautyBoxes,3dojud,teresatt07,2,Sat Jul 18 02:10:05 2015 UTC,To be fair not everything  they sample in boxes is multi-use like sheet masks and bonus foils for instance but you should be able to get a good feel for most of your box. The mystery pack is supposed to be one deluxe and one regular sample and I would think that nobody pays for it because you get it free with 35+ purchases. I'd definitely contact them since a sample is damaged and they'll likely send you a new mystery pack!
BeautyBoxes,3dojud,rlw0312,2,Fri Jul 17 23:48:27 2015 UTC,I got the mystery pack on my last order and one of my samples was a sealed pouch that had already been torn open. Very rarely have I read about anyone actually being pleased with what they got. Thankfully it was free.
BeautyBoxes,3dojud,BunsMunchHay,2,Sat Jul 18 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"Please be careful with your eye gel! I got a dried out sample like yours. I did a patch test with no issue, but when I put it on my eyes it burned like crazy and left a bright red rash. Definitely toss it out!"

BeautyBoxes,3dob28,dazy5,5,Fri Jul 17 22:15:37 2015 UTC,"Box twins. Overall this box was okay for me, I can always use more dry shampoo, and I love trying new skincare items. The Jelly pong pong doesn't really set so I don't think it would make the best eyeliner, but I didn't try setting it with eyeshadow so I may be wrong. The lip balm was blah but I'll use it. Unfortunately I cannot use nail polish due to my job... I can try it on my toes, however your swatch seems like this isn't a very promising product."
BeautyBoxes,3dob28,amawhy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:20:35 2015 UTC,The nail polish set a bit better than I expected. I used a base and a top coat. It seems a little doughy but hopefully it will harden more. The color is super cute though. I was just about to go out and by a summery color.
BeautyBoxes,3dob28,pantherluna,3,Fri Jul 17 23:54:34 2015 UTC,"Box twins!  I just picked it up from the mailbox :)  I haven't decided what to do with the Jelly Pong Pong.  I'm so tempted to open it and swatch it, but I don't think I'll get much use out of it, and if I keep it sealed I can donate it to a shelter.  Must resist urge to swatch!  Also got the full size Boscia BB Cream Bronze that I redeemed points for last month and I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it blends for how dark it comes out of the tube."
BeautyBoxes,3dob28,writtensparks,3,Sat Jul 18 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"Almost twins. I'm getting tweezers instead of the lip balm. Not too thrilled about the Jelly Pong Pong, the color looks terrible but maybe it'll look better in person. I'm tired of pink mail polish, can a girl get ANY other color please?!

BeautyBoxes,3dob28,ladyvilla,2,Sat Jul 18 04:27:15 2015 UTC,"Left to Right:  Eva-Nye Freshen Up Dry Shampoo: This has a lovely scent; it actually reminds me of the powdery/flowery scent of my mother-in-law's perfume. I'll use it. Aurora Gel Effect Nail Lacquer in 4 Alarm Fire: I like the color but I'm not banking on quality and staying power since the swatch on my thumb nail already has a scratch down the middle. I'll try it out for reals tonight. Pur-lisse Pur Bright Ultra Skin Brightening Serum: I've heard of this brand and I'll try it out.  Jelly Pong Pong 2-in-1 Eyeliner and Shadow in a bronzey brown shade (no name): The color is pretty, but it is a little dark for a shadow for me. I'll probably use it as an eyeliner, but I'm not a huge fan of pencil liners. Be a Bombshell Lip Balm in French Kiss: It is a very pretty pink but it has almost no noticable pigment. I like that there is no scent.  July Ipsy bag: I think the pattern is adorable. I'll find a use for it; it is too cute to hide.  This month is a 4/6 for me, so not bad. Bonus dog picture since they (Eleanor and Abe) wanted to smell everything in the bag."
BeautyBoxes,3domhb,hooploopdoop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what they plan to do with the new charms program but the old one you would get 450 points every 90 days of consistent subscription and 50 points for every review. You could then cash in those point for full sized items that they had available at the time which they would ship with your next box.   Before it got shut down I was saving for another Tarte Lip Tint, but I vaguely remember them offering items that had been in past boxes, like the Previse serum, and I believe the Lauren B polish.  If you would like to read more here is a link to the old website's Charms info section"

BeautyBoxes,3doh78,havinabadtime,2,Sat Jul 18 11:56:01 2015 UTC,Wanted to jump in and say I love the brand too!  Every product I've tried by them has been incredible!  I have two full sizes.  A face wash and moisturizer.  My husband uses both too and speaks highly.  The full size products are so huge and last months even with both of us using them.

BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,chef_boyceardee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:49:08 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel. The products in the curated box looks like stuff I would use daily. However I am just coming off a curated box and feel dumb getting two in a row for some reason and the regular box is adorable.
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,AcesCharles5,5,Fri Jul 17 19:58:46 2015 UTC,I'm either getting the dry shampoo or the sunscreen setting spray cause that thing seems pretty dope
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,cheshirecatds,7,Fri Jul 17 17:22:32 2015 UTC,I have that setting spray and it's awesome for reapplying sunscreen over makeup. Going to get the sample size to throw in my purse!
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,tenlilindians,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:01 2015 UTC,How well does it actually work. Because if it works well I'm pretty sure I need it in my life.

In terms of setting makeup, I'm not an expert (only other setting spray I've used is e.l.f.), but it certainly doesn't have any negative effects. I mainly bought for the sunscreen element, though."

BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,pajamasinbananas,3,Fri Jul 17 16:27:24 2015 UTC,I got the coola setting spray in my box this month and is nice but it stings my eyes when I first apply it.  Newbie question - if I miss sample choice I know they send one at random. Will I be exempt from the setting spray as a duplicate?
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,pantherluna,3,Sat Jul 18 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"yep they won't send you a duplicate - unless you choose that in your sample choice, I guess? But it doesn't sound like you're going to do that ha!"
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,Delanakatrella,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"Stings your eyes...as in the product landing on your eyelids stings, or perhaps a residual mist of the spray is getting in them?  I have sensitive eyes and I was considering the Coola, just looking for clarification.  If it's the latter thing, I assume just keeping your eyes closed a bit longer might work?"
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,kiwimangoes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"I've only used it twice, but both times my eyes stung like crazy after opening them. I tend to be very sensitive to sunscreen in my eyes so I think it was just the mist getting into my eyes."
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,pajamasinbananas,2,Sat Jul 18 21:35:36 2015 UTC,So I think I'm going to go with the dry shampoo (second choice is the Coola if I can't get that) and I reserved the mask sampler set for my BBPlus. :)
BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,kiwimangoes,2,Fri Jul 17 23:33:57 2015 UTC,"I reserved one too, but I'm confused.  Did they charge us, or how do we pay for that? Is it automatically charged when they charge us for our August box? Ideally I would like to use my points...."

BeautyBoxes,3dmgo6,cheshirecatds,2,Sun Jul 19 08:14:36 2015 UTC,I am very torn about which sample to choose but I think I am going with the dry shampoo. It looks like it's the travel size bottle which is $17 so I feel like even if the rest of my box sucks it will still be worth my $10. Am I the only one underwhelmed by the pool print? Compared to April and July's boxes I think it's kinda zzzzzz.

Yipes, thanks for the heads up about that one.  I got the Octavio La Playa salt spray in my Ipsy, and I was initially really worried about using it, since I have very dry delicate 1A duckling fluff, and I didn't want my hair going all crispy and nasty like it does when I go to the hotsprings, but this one worked out really nicely, I put it on dry and it gave me some actual texture.   But seriously, go chuck that bottle off a cliff."
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,DiKetian,5,Fri Jul 17 13:38:58 2015 UTC,I've used it on dry hair for texture & liked it so much I bought it.

BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,1Marshall91,2,Fri Jul 17 15:37:42 2015 UTC,Maybe it's me!  I'll try it on wet hair tonight and report back.  One thought though: did you shake it up first?
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,1Marshall91,2,Fri Jul 17 17:56:22 2015 UTC,I gave it a cursory shake but I didn't go paint can shaker style on it. Do you think I got all filler and no salt?
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,1Marshall91,4,Fri Jul 17 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I think you may have gotten a bad bottle.  I have all of four day's experience with salt spray so ymmv!"

BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,craaackle,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"I gave mine to my cousin from a previous bag and she enjoyed it, her hair also didn't feel like what you described and looked pretty good. I wonder what happened with yours, maybe some ingredients settled?"
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,Kaypas88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:24 2015 UTC,I'm tempted to try it again but not enough to actually do it.
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,PhantomGirl,5,Fri Jul 17 15:38:22 2015 UTC,What's your hair like? It could also be reacting with your shampoo/conditioner.
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,ckellyblush,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:28 2015 UTC,I had the exact same experience as you did! I was so excited about getting it too! I have super fine straight hair that never holds a curl for very long even with heavy duty hairspray though so that might be why it didn't work so well for me.
BeautyBoxes,3dmbo8,hjrancher,2,Fri Jul 17 16:24:48 2015 UTC,"Omg yes! Same here. I love sea salt sprays, but this one is so gross. My hair was like yours this morning, almost gooey, not nice at all!"

What I did was spray on slightly damp hair (for me 30mins air-drying out of the shower), braid my hair, and wear it like that for the rest of the day. No weird textural issues, but it might be dependent on hair type tbh."

I hope you love the Vasanti, it's amazing on oily summer skin! Despite the teeny sizes, the bronzer and shadows are cute too and we got the same shadows. :P  I am iffy on the heatstyle thing.. it sounds like something that might be better for shorter hair so I might not use it too often."
BeautyBoxes,3dnf8m,hellokrissi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:49:39 2015 UTC,I like the Vasanti! I was pretty disappointed how empty the tube was though. It's a little harsh on my super sensitive skin so I'll probably use it less than the recommended 3-5 times a week but it made my skin super soft.  I like the bronzer and shadows colours. They're pretty similar to ones I have already but they're a great size for travel or a gym locker stash. The colour payoff was a little weak for the shadows but the texture is nice.  I haven't tried the Heatshift or the cleanser yet but they smell really good.

Although they did add some I am interested in, so may resub for a bit.   The perfume is legit and I really like that it is about the size of a rollerball but is a spray form so I feel for travel it works way better than the real mini versions of popular perfumes (Alien is my go to perfume and even though I have it, I got that one month so I'll have a good travel size to take with me). The vial holder you get with your first sub is good quality too. I also really like that you can select which perfume you receive vs. by chance.   Their customer service is really good (one month my perfume arrived smashed- and they resent my perfume and included a handwritten apology note).  Highly recommend if you want to try out more common perfumes. Would love if they'd add some more niche style fragrances."

I don’t even pay for mascara anymore because I get so many samples (not that it’s a bad thing at all). I only worry that because I have pigmented lips that the lip liner will be too light, but the color is pretty. The spray I might just give to my mom since she has thick straight hair and I’m pretty happy with my hair products right now. It says to use on damp hair, but I might just ignore that and try it for a End Of The Second Day revival.  Anyone get these samples before? Advice on what to start with? Did you love something? Will that peel melt my face off? Let me know."
BeautyBoxes,3do6w5,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:12 2015 UTC,"I got the lipliner in a darker rust color which is very pretty, BUT it came without a lid and got product all over the items in the box. I think it's still fine to use, so I won't bother them to replace it, but it's on my list of ""mildly annoying""."
BeautyBoxes,3dncuk,imhereforthemeta,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"theBalm® cosmetics Balm Desert® Bronzer/Blush: This is teeny tiny, but it's a pretty cool bronzer. I liked my Tarte sample a little better though, so I may trade this for something else!   Key West Aloe Save a Tan : I expected to be lukewarm about this, but honestly? I live in Texas. Whether I am a beach bunny or I hide in the house all day, my skin will be affected. This smells super nice too, I am looking forward to using it despite having little experience with after tanning products.  stila look at me liquid lipstick trio : HNGGG ITS SO. BEAUTIFUL. I got the coral one. Softest, most lovely little lipstick i've ever gotten a sample of. It smells amazing, and it's actually pretty subtle on my lips. I just took a HUGE swig of bottled soda and there was no transfer either.   Supergoop!® Daily Correct CC Cream ​SPF 35+ : Yeah, I am a huge fan of CC creams. I use them when I am doing anything athletic. This sample is tiny, but I usually only use them on really dark spots anyway.   Miss Jessie's® Original Jelly Soft Curls : I was actually MOST excited about this, because FINALLY A HAIR PRODUCT I CAN UUUSEEEEE. I have her whole line in my favorites and I am super excited. I only wish this came in something other than a foil. It's really largue and generous, but it's going to be annoying getting multiple uses out of this, even though I could easily use it 3-4 times with what they put in there.   Atelier Cologne Pomélo Paradis Cologne Absolue – 100 ml : I tried so hard to be angry about the fact that I got a perfume sample of a 110 dollar perfume, but actually, holy shit, this is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled? In my original review, I was like ""some idiot will need to reaaaaly love this to spend that much on a full bottle. I might be that idiot. I might be. that. idiot.   Birchbox, if you could stop hitting constant home runs with me, that would be great. I will use everything in this box, and consider buying almost everything."
BeautyBoxes,3dncuk,catlace,2,Fri Jul 17 18:02:05 2015 UTC,Hell I have straight-wavy hair and I love the miss Jessie's products! My boyfriend's sister gave me some of the pillow soft curls and it's one of the few things that tames frizz and doesn't weigh my super fine hair down.  I remember the multicultural curls was nice too when I got a sample. Those samples are huge and I got like a billion uses out of mine. I emptied it into another container so I didn't have to waste any of that goodness. Lol
BeautyBoxes,3dncuk,Echo-Lawrence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:15 2015 UTC,I got the multi-cultural curls in a Beauty Box  5 before I cancelled it and I LOVED it!  Bought the full size immediately

A lot of the items feel more like free samples and I wish they weren't so obvious about their $10 add-on being old stock they're trying to dump.   They've had some good months recently, but I've been with them for years and they can be really hit-or-miss. Getting tanner is extra crappy."

It also seems to be the one with the most unwanted products. This month I got a brow pencil which I wont use, so basically I got a top coat, a mini mascara and a mini foundation sample. Without the brow pencil, the value is just under what I paid. I find with ipsy/BB I still get significantly more than what I paid even if there is a product or two I don't care for.   I also don't get the $10 addons since they seem so random. I've seen people get old prive boxes or cheap products while a small number get an expensive/luxury products. I'm sort of on the fence with topbox at the moment. It's just nothing really new or exciting each month."

Apply to damp hair. Style with blow-dryer and styling tool for maximum results. To re-style: Apply heat from a styling tool and re-style. For maximum results, set styling temperature above 120°F/50°C  Example, you use a blow dryer and some velcro rollers to get soft waves in the morning, then after work, you want to flat iron it straight as a stick or go super curly with a curling iron, you could do that, all without having to use more hair products."

For example, this month I got Skinfood products including a full-sized eyeliner, a full-sized rice exfoliation mask, and two sample sized bottles of toner and emulsion. So you get pretty much exactly what you pay for, which is fine (as was the same the last couple of months.)  From Ipsy I got a bottle of Octavio sea salt spray, mini Tarte bronzer, Aurora nail polish, mini Vasanti facial cleanser, and Be a Bombshell lip balm.  Much higher overall value for the price, and good products as well, so it depends on what you're into."

One is their beauty bag, which is makeup, skincare, and maybe a ""lifestyle"" product for $24/month+shipping. The second is a mask bag, which is mainly sheetmasks, capsule/clay masks, and foot/hand masks for $15/month+shipping.  Edit: Also they send an email to beauty bag subscribers with a spoiler and give you the option to choose the colour/scent you prefer for a product or two next month.

There's some really good stuff in this month, I'm pretty happy with this all. I really like the bag, too!   Vasanti BrightenUp! Exfoliator. I've received this in pretty much every beauty box I've subscribed to over the years, and I've used it up each time. This is the only beauty box item I've ever been so crazy about that I went out and bought the full size bottle. Essie nail polish in Fashion Playground. A really pretty mint with a shimmer in it (doesn't show up on camera). I really like this colour, and the shimmer makes it different enough to be unique. Octavio La Playa Sea Salt Spray. I was really leery about this at first - I have very delicate 1A duckling fluff and I was worried the salt would make it crispy like it gets in hot springs. However, I tried it out on dry hair and it's actually really awesome! It's given my hair some body without feeling too dry or matted. Be a Bombshell lip balm in French Kiss. Haven't tried it yet, but it looks pink in the tube and swatches a very faint sheen. Edit: Almost no colour, just a very slight hint of pink sheen, but very nice formula, nice and moisturizing. City Color HD Powder. The weakest item in here for me - I just don't use foundations or powders or any skin makeup. It's probably fine and it looks pretty big if not full sized, and I'll either gift it or put it in the cosplay makeup pile."

BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,Love_Trust_Hope,4,Fri Jul 17 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"I am having trouble sleeping right now, so I'll give you the breakdown of my experience:   Cheap boxes:   IPSY: Subbed for 3 months. Only received 2 items I was interested in using (one of which was a nail polish from a brand I regularly use). Got a lot of really cheap quality brands. Unsubbed because i was positive the quiz doesn't matter/change what you get, the points system is ridiculous, and they want you to whore them out on Facebook at every single opportunity. Sample Society: Subbed 3 months. Received a couple of decent items, but they were generally low-value boxes and they would send some really, really bad stuff sometimes. Like, L'oreal shampoo bad. A lot of really tiny perfumes. They would advertise items that ended up not being offered. It was horrible. They do have a ""mystery box"" that is 15 samples they sometimes sell that is well worth the price though and I've ordered 3 of them with 100% satisfaction.   Mid-price boxes:   Glossybox: Meh. I tried for 3 months (that's my ""I'll give it a try"" timeline). I got high quality items and the boxes had a high value, especially considering I got it at a discount. However, the items I got were just completely underwhelming to me. I think Glossybox is probably really good for some people. I'm not one of them. It had a mix of skincare, makeup, nailpolish, hair items. CS is a bit passive aggressive in my experience. Boxycharm: I had subbed to them for 3 months, then unsubbed, and have come back for now 2 more months so far. I like Boxycharm. The value is good. The products are generally good. I use a good amount of what I get and I like what I use. They have a decent points system (charms) but since they redid their website it still isn't up and running yet. In the 3 months I subbed to them before though, I got enough charms for a full-size mascara. I only stopped subbing to them because I had two other boxes I preferred and was getting in too much stuff. I decided to drop one, and get Boxycharm back. BeautyFix: Sigh. i subbed for 12 months. Lately they have been dropping the ball though so I just unsubbed this week. If you like trying a lot of skincare and hair products, it's really the best one to get. They used to do a better mix of makeup/skincare/haircare/ tools/perfume/nails. Really, an all-encompassing box. This month though, they sent out a ton of tiny tubes of samples (instead of full-size like normal), and they have a pretty solid history of sending out a medium shade complexion product to 100% of their subscribers regardless of their skin tone. I'm going to watch them for the next 3 months to decide if I want to resub or not. I really like them when they have a good month, but my God, when they have a bad month, it's horrible.     High-price box:   Wantable Makeup: MY FAVORITE. I LOVE Wantable and sing its praises wherever I can. It is more expensive than the other boxes ($40/month) and you get 4 full-size items, and the boxes generally have retail values from $80-100 and it is 100% customizable. AND THEY LISTEN TO YOUR QUIZ. If you tell them no bronzers and they send you one, they send you a replacement item. The quiz is comprehensive, and you can actually return items if you don't like them for a partial refund (prorated from the retail costs). If you don't return anything, they give you a $4 credit for the next month, so in reality, my boxes only cost $36. If you have a friend signup with your referral, they give you a $10 credit in addition to the $4. The biggest thing to know about them though, is the brands are generally (not always) small/indie brands that sell in high-end boutiques. I've never heard of most of them before. That said, the quality is always amazing. Here is a running album of the items I get from them every month. I keep it to give people a good idea of what Wantable offers.    When I look at my daily use, I would say Wantable is the top for most useful items, followed by BeautyFix. Then comes Boxycharm. I'm hoping I can get BeautyFix again in the future, assuming they don't keep sending out shit. If I do, I'll drop Boxy again because BeautyFix+Wantable is the perfect combo of makeup/skin/hair that I could possibly need."
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,mrs_sugarlips,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:10:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, you have answered my prayers on this, lol. From what you said, Boxycharm seems to be the one I'll sub to first, and then perhaps Wantable Makeup. I really love how indepth this answer was, thank you so much!"
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,Serri330,2,Fri Jul 17 08:35:02 2015 UTC,"I unsubbed from Ipsy for similar reasons as you, but for different product annoyances. I tended to always get skincare items and bronzer - things I had said time and time again that I didn't want. I gave it several months, thinking that if I responded to the reviews negatively in regards to the products I didn't want, they'd stop sending them. But lo and behold, they kept coming, as well as repeats of similar items - ie, kept getting black eyeliner and nude shimmery eye-shadow every month, though admittedly from different brands.  I had Birchbox a few years ago, and unsubbed from them as well due to an overwhelming amount of skin care items, but their points system is fantastic. While I didn't love the boxes themselves, I'd usually get an item or two I really liked, and then could buy things I was interested in with points. However, given that you prefer skin care items, they might be the best bet :) They also seem to actually take your preference quiz into consideration, with a few misses here and there.  I currently only sub to Boxycharm. They tend to do more makeup overall, so I'm happy, but they don't have a great point system, which is a bummer. In fact, I just logged into my account, and while they still mention their reward point system, I can't find anywhere on the site where I can view items that I can redeem my Charms for."

BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,prettycat32,2,Fri Jul 17 11:53:52 2015 UTC,Birchbox was 'luxury-sample' sized and cost $10 a month when I was subbed :)

BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,rqnadi,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"The quiz doesn't really matter with ipsy, I was with them for over a year and continued to receive items I had not checked as liked on my quiz, while more fitting bags were available. They  had products I really wanted each month, but I never received them so I finally quite. Ipsy knows u will not like all the items in yr bag, but they hope u will like a few. U just have to decide if the items u get are worth the cost, and accept that u will receive a ton of products u won't like, such as lip products or polish. Birchbox has its own ups and downs. You get a little more choice, getting to pick the item, or curated box, but in my opinion the samples are smaller, not as much full size. They do have a better point system though. Glossybox is usually pretty good, but u still get items u might not want. Same with boxycharm."
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,pantherluna,2,Fri Jul 17 10:55:40 2015 UTC,"Ispy doesn't really seem to look at your quiz results (but honestly, most of the brands that do quizzes generally ignore the quiz results).  The way to improve your Ipsy bag is to review the products they send you.  The last questions in the review ask things like ""Do you like receiving products from this brand?"" and ""Do you like receiving this kind of product?""  I used to get self tanners and hair spray every single month, then I went through my history and reviewed all of them and said those product types were not for me.  I like my Ipsy bags a lot better now."
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,rakut,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:31 2015 UTC,I always review them though and put down that they aren't for me.
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,pantherluna,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:45 2015 UTC,I have the same opinion of ipsy. They gave me like 8 light pink lipstick safer I told them each time I hated the color and it didn't go with my auburn hair. I had ipsy for probably 19 months I think before I couldn't take it anymore. They were giving me junk and the good stuff I got I couldn't use because it just wasn't my color. I emailed their customer care begging for them to not send me anymore pink lipstick and asking if there was anything more I could be doing to make sure I don't get anymore. I never got a response and the next month I got another pink lip product... I canceled that day.
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,pantherluna,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:46:14 2015 UTC,Aw that sucks. I don't think I'm going to give them longer than a month to fix it
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,pantherluna,2,Sun Jul 19 23:46:02 2015 UTC,"The purpose of the quiz is not to pick out what you will and won't receive.  Just because something is unchecked doesn't mean you won't get it.  It's just a guide for your preferences.  I understand wanting more personalization, but you're unlikely to get that from a $10 bag."
BeautyBoxes,3dlm8j,pantherluna,2,Fri Jul 17 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like Birchbox, at the $10 price, is more customized to your quiz than Ipsy."

BeautyBoxes,3dkr81,Sunshineonleith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:40 2015 UTC,I have the ruelala sub too and I'm about to try and log in. Did you guys contact customer support?  Edit: I was able to log in. No word on this months box though.
BeautyBoxes,3dkr81,apple_cores,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:13:58 2015 UTC,"I was finally able to log in - not on the one where you scroll down, but it's on the tabs on the top of their front page.  Also I reached out and they responded. Apparently their program is run so that when you had originally signed up (ex. mine was mid-month), that's when they start shipping. Not beginning of the month.  So chances are it's coming. haha Sorry to freak anyone out!"
BeautyBoxes,3djyun,SoftMetalFoxes,3,Thu Jul 16 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Jelly Pong Pong Cosmetics 2-in-1 Shadow/Liner in Bronze: I'm not a big fan of things I actually have to sharpen. That said, this is a product type I'll use. The product goes on smoothly and with minimal fuss, and while it can be smoked out, it isn't too prone to smudging. The color, unfortunately, though, isn't super special - It's another burnt bronze, and one I'm not too excited by. It should go nicely with my eyes, though, and it's not glittery or too shiny. It's also somewhat water resistant, which is nice for the summer months.  On a more general note, I'm not really into this brand's aesthetic. In the vein of Too Faced, Pixi, and Lime Crime, the twee ""so whimsicle!"" attitude isn't my thing at all, and the product isn't good enough to get me to look past the brand image. Others will, obviously, completely disagree. I will use  this, but while I have purchased products like this in the past, I certainly won't buy this brand specifically.  Here's an image of the opened product with the cap off.   Eau Thermale Avène Cleanance Gel Soapless Cleanser: It's a cleanser... there's not too much to say about it. It does what it's supposed to do and does it well. I know that's not very enthusiastic, but don't get me wrong,  I'm very happy to receive cleansers at all times, and this one will certainly get used, but I wouldn't buy it simply because it is overpriced for a cleanser, a product type that can only be so high quality.  Crown Brush Professional Tweezers in Pink: Aw. I'm not a big fan of pink, especially this shade. Super minor complaints, though. While I already own the holy grail of tweezers, a Tweezerman, and this pair is nowhere near so fine, I did immediately put it to work clearing up some errant eyebrow hairs, and it did a good job gripping and pulling, no breakage. They feel sturdy. Perfectly fine for all but the most fussy detail work. Though I wouldn't have bought these specifically, they're nice to have around and will see plenty of play, especially when I travel.  Jor'el Parker perfume in Classico: Some people dislike perfume. I am not one of them, and was excited to receive this. How about this sample size?! I've bought rollerballs in the ten to twenty dollar range with less inside. This scent does not smell like tuberose or mandarin, though it does smell quite nice. It's a somewhat heavier white floral, better for the spring than the summer. Primary notes are gardenia (one of my favorites) with undertones of cyclamen and what smells to me like coumarin and some very faint soapy notes (blame the coumarin). Sillage is all right, lasting power remains to be determined but so far has held fast when rolled out onto the  wrists. I have other florals and other gardenias (including my signature scent), so I might not buy this, but I do like it very much, will carry it with me in my bag, and will surely use it up.   Tarte deluxe Amazonian clay waterproof bronzer in Park Avenue Princess:  I actually own this already in the Rainforest After Dark palette, something I didn't recall until I had already swatched it. Foolish! Well, this is a nice bronzer, soft and workable, but I don't use too much bronzer  right now - My natural color has come back for the season. Because it is not matte, it is not suitable for a contour, but it does look nice on the cheeks or tucked under the chin for definition on light and medium skin, and makes a beautiful highlighter on darker skin tones. As I said, I already own this, and probably would have bought it again. Here's an image of the product open.   Bag: Ugly, but not offensively so, and made of nice material with a good layout. Now holds sewing notions in my desk drawer. I can't really complain about this whatsoever.  Overall: What a good bag! While nothing in here is something I would have specifically bought for myself, everything inside is something I can use and am happy with. Ipsy is great to scratch the ""I want to try something new"" itch as long as you keep your expectations realistic. Looking forward to next month!"
BeautyBoxes,3djyun,meekosmom,2,Thu Jul 16 22:00:17 2015 UTC,I'm in love with the Tarte bronzer. It's perfect on my skin and the case is so cute!
BeautyBoxes,3djyun,AnnaBreit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:10:52 2015 UTC,It is really cute! It's great for a makeup bag.

BeautyBoxes,3dk13a,Stonedbaker,2,Thu Jul 16 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"Purlisse 4 in 1 gently soy milk cleanser, Eyetini eyeliner in Blue Hawaiian, Tarte Bronzer in Park Avenue Princess, Be A Bombshell lip balm in ruby, and a roller ball perfume, which I did not like and already gave away."
BeautyBoxes,3dkpz8,xtinebean,7,Fri Jul 17 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"Just email them. I'm sure they'll send you a new bag with what you were supposed to get. Plus this helps them figure out what went wrong on their end so it can be less likely to happen in the future. So don't think of it as being selfish, since this might prevent it from happening to others.   With putting together thousands and thousands of bags each month, it's pretty understandable that there could be mistakes. And ipsy is very good about fixing their mistakes."
BeautyBoxes,3dkpz8,pantherluna,7,Fri Jul 17 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"I'd e-mail and politely explain what happened and that you were looking forward to trying certain items. Best case scenario they send you the items/new bag, and worst is they can't help you but their customer service is usually pretty good in my experience."
BeautyBoxes,3dkpz8,hauntes,4,Fri Jul 17 02:34:50 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't make a huge stink about the bag (aka if they are out of certain items, etc) but it it certainly worth mentioning in a 'hey this is really disappointing due to the fact that I got excited about receiving xyz but you sent abc, etc' just so they know thats not cool!  But the eyeshadows would be a bigger concern to me because you used your points on them and picked out what you wanted.  If you knew you were to receive those colors (instead of the ones you chose) you might of waited to see what else you could use points on!    I hear they have great customer service (I've never had issues so I can't say if this is true or not) so its certainly worth contacting them!"
BeautyBoxes,3dkpz8,karrottop94,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"I would assume they will fix their error, otherwise how will you be able to review the items you did receive if your glamroom is showing other products? Especially when you used points for a clearly customizable item."

I used the brush for my highlight this morning and it was really nice. As for the setting powder, I've been wanting to get a transparent powder for awhile so Boxycharm just took care of that. The daily leave in conditioner smells amazing, like I just want to douse myself in it. No thoughts on the lip liner yet, I don't use lip liner that often."
