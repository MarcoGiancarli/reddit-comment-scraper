giveaways,3boxot,Two_English_Bulldogs,3,Tue Jun 30 23:29:42 2015 UTC,"TL;DR People are dicks, also when they see something reposted for the second time they vote it down. Most giveaways aren't scams, just check the site hosting the giveaway. Most gleam.io ones are good"
giveaways,3boxot,jihalliday,3,Tue Jun 30 23:35:26 2015 UTC,"It's not just people down voting a post that has been re-posted for the second time, but also people that post something for a few hours, delete it, and then re-post it again to have it back at the top of /r/giveaways. The rules on the sidebar are pretty clear and the people that do this are violating them. If you are going to post something, then leave it up for the 24 hours and if no one else posts it before you AFTER the 24 hours are up, then you can re-post it, but re-posting the same content every 6 hours not only denies other people a chance at posting their links, but spams this subreddit.   The rules are in place to make this fair for everyone"

giveaways,3blgxk,WordsThatStartw_Ass,2,Tue Jun 30 04:34:55 2015 UTC,I'm really sure. What i do sometimes is make a second twitter/twitch just for giveaways. That way i am still following if they check
giveaways,3blgxk,Stormcrow21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:41:24 2015 UTC,I've been thinking of doing that. Seems like a safe way to do it and not get my actual Twitch account bogged down. Thanks for the reply!
giveaways,3blgxk,Stormcrow21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:48:39 2015 UTC,meant to say not really sure lol. But ya its been working out for me
giveaways,3blgxk,bedingfield,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:54:38 2015 UTC,Thats a big no no! I mean thats why they require you to follow to gain more followers. If you unfollow then you are disqualified. That applies to every giveaway IMO
