InvisibleBicycles,329xi7,Namisaur,3,Sun Apr 12 06:36:12 2015 UTC,"One suggestion for improvement. You see how the bricks flicker at various brightness levels? Instead of using the clone stamp tool,which is what I presume you're using, just mask out the guy's limbs, and then use a still of the top half of the image from the very last and first frame (where he's not in front of the bricks on either end) and place it underneath him."
InvisibleBicycles,329xi7,DigitalSterling,2,Sun Apr 12 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"First, let me say that I am grateful you took the time to offer me advice! I did, however, use the method you described to use a mask with the first and last frames, I just wasn't very careful or sensitive to the way the lighting in the shot changed. I didn't really notice the bricks until after the gif was ready and was too tired of working on it to fix it. Thanks again though!"
InvisibleBicycles,329xi7,EffingTank,2,Sun Apr 12 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"There are lots of other methods to do this.  One of the fastest methods, if you have a locked down camera and a solid background, or a patterned background, you can use the Advance Repair tool on Pixelmator.  The other is to frame by frame masking in photoshop/after effects, and then putting the person on top of an empty still background"
