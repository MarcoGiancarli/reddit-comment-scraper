musictheory,3e2mc1,Zombater,14,Tue Jul 21 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"The two main pentatonic scales are sometimes called ""major pentatonic"" and ""minor pentatonic."" They're basically two ""modes"" of the same scale:   C Major Pentatonic: C-D-E-G-A A Minor Pentatonic: A-C-D-E-G   Notice how both share the same notes; what separates them is what note is the tonic.  Notice also that the relationship between C Major Pentatonic and A Minor Pentatonic is perfectly analogous to the relationship between C Major (Ionian) and A Minor (Aeolian): they are what are usually called ""relative"" major and minor scales, or different ""modes"" of the white-notes diatonic collection.  It should also be easy to see how the two pentatonic scales are subsets of their corresponding diatonic scales:   C major (Ionian): C-D-E-F-G-A-B A minor (Aeolian): A-B-C-D-E-F-G   The bold notes are the notes of the Pentatonic scale subset.  One of the special properties of the Pentatonic scales is that they contain no half-steps. This is part of what gives them their unique sound."
musictheory,3e2mc1,Cdesese,12,Tue Jul 21 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"Another cool relationship between pentatonic scales and diatonic scales is that they are ""complements"" of each other: If you take all twelve notes of the chromatic scale, and remove the notes of any diatonic scale, the notes left over will form a pentatonic scale. This is easy to see on a piano keyboard: the white notes form a diatonic scale, and the black notes form a pentatonic scale."
musictheory,3e2mc1,Cdesese,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"Also the key signatures of the diatonic and the pentatonic will be inverted. Taking the chromatic scale and isolating C major gives F# pentatonic, for example."

These are the key signatures on opposite sides of the circle of fifths. However, not all of the notes in a pentatonic scale's key signature will actually apply to the notes in that pentatonic scale: for example, the F# in the G major/E minor key signature doesn't affect any of the notes in the G major/E major pentatonic scales, and the Bb in the F major/D minor key signature doesn't affect any of the notes in the F major/D minor pentatonic scales."

For example, let's take A minor (A-B-C-D-E-F-G)  Of course, you can use A minor pentatonic (A-C-D-E-G)  But you can also use a minor pentatonic base on the 5th scale degree, in this case the 5th scale tone is E, so you can use E minor  pentatonic (E-G-A-B-D).  Notice all the notes in E minor pentatonic are in the A minor scale.  What makes this sound cool is it is adding a minor 9 sound.  You can also use the 2nd scale degree for a pentatonic, in this case B minor pentatonic (B-D-E-F#-A).  Yeah, the F# isn't in A minor but it still sounds cool because it gives a Dorian Vibe.   Theory and terms to the side.  Play a minor pentatonic on the root note for the vanilla sound.  Play it off the 5th for a bit outside sound.  Play it off the 2nd for even more outside sound."

Usually, it'll be during a buildup in the song, 2/3 of the way through, and used to dial the climax up to level 11.  I think my teacher's tongue in cheek description speaks to how overusing this device is an easy, albeit cheap method for heightening a climax in music. Often, the new keys are not tonally related to the old one, and songs would stay in the new key rather than returning to the original one, but such matters were usually more the domain of classical composers than pop songwriters.  My copy of A Whole New World only has a single direct modulation from D major to F major on the final word of Aladdin's line, ""Now I'm in a whole new world with you.""

It happens when Jasmine sings 'Unbelievable sights' - switches from D major up to F major.  Actually, THIS PAGE HERE confirms that there is only ONE key change. It's the chord sequence for the song.  Maybe your teacher was referring to the switching between minor and major chords, which happens quite a few times. If I were to take a guess as to why that happens I would say it's to heighten the intensity of the emotion at certain points, especially in the minor parts (e.g. 'every moment red letter').  The key change in the middle of the song is there to create a rising feeling, which helps with the build up to the climax."

Just because you can make a larger grouping doesn't mean you should. 12/4 alternating with 8/4 seems like a good option. Or it could be 4 measures of 3/4 plus 4 measures of 2/4, which is kind of cool because it shows that what both the 12/4 and the 8/4 measure have in common is a four-beat pulse, though in the former the pulse is three quarters (a dotted half note) in duration, and in the latter the pulse is two quarters (a half note) in duration.  The truth is, such decisions are mostly arbitrary, and made on the basis of several, sometimes competing factors, among them tempo, readability, and the traditional associations of some meters with certain genres or styles of music. Even the choice, in this case, of quarter notes as the basic duration for these meters is arbitrary; it could be based on eighth notes instead (12/8 + 8/8). So, yea, you could notate a piece in many different ways (probably not infinite, but you're the math guy--you tell me), and they would all more-or-less result in the same performance, though I'd say only a handful would be practical."

EDIT: FYI, the first method could be seen as a generalization of the idea of ""parallel"" modes (e.g., C major and C minor are parallel modes). All modes that share the same tonic note are parallel modes (e.g., C Ionian, C Lydian, C Mixolydian, C Dorian, C Aeolian, C Phrygian, C Locrian). The second method is a generalization of ""relative"" modes (e.g., C major and A minor are relative modes). All modes that share the same key signature (i.e., general scalar collection) are relative modes (e.g., C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, B Locrian)."

musictheory,3e3mjq,tjmusic,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Add another vote for the first method.  If you think in a different major scale, you're trying to keep two tonics in your head - one for the ""related"" major scale, and one for the key you're playing in.  It's a lot less work to just think of the alterations."
musictheory,3e3mjq,ProgKibble,2,Tue Jul 21 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"I've always found the former to be quicker and more descriptive of what I'm playing. If I play over a C major chord, I play a C major scale. If I play a C7 chord, I flat the 7 on the chord and I flat the 7 in the scale.  This seems to make the most sense to me, and also makes it easier to transpose to other keys and chords. The other way means I'd have to think C7 chord, play the major scale of a 5th lower which is F. This way seems to take me longer, and thinking about F major when I'm playing a C chord is more confusing to me than just thinking it's a C7 chord so flat the 7. The less thinking I do while I play the better :) Also, the former method may help train your ears to hear modes and intervals as you focus on the unique qualities of the scale rather than trying to understand everything in just major scales. I thoroughly enjoyed this happening to me. Glad to see everyone else seems to agree. That means we're right, right?"

In jazz, however, an improvisor might find it interesting to experiment with the second method (relative) simply for a different approach. For example, if I'm improvising over E phrygian, I can think of the phrygian scale starting on E (E major plus 4 flats) or I can play C major material depending on the context and the effect I'm hoping to convey. In other words, I'd be improvising using the zero flat collection and alternating C and E as the centers."

For piano it's having to think about bass clef at the same time, for guitar it's that there are so many positions at which you can play most notes and some are easier than others but sheet music doesn't specify (this, to me, is the advantage of tabs).  For both, the chords throw me off too, but more music theory classes are gradually changing that.  I also don't find myself needing to use guitar sheet music very often, and piano is purely recreational for me.  I am capable of reading it to the point that if I practice for a bit I'll get it and remember it though, but with guitar and piano it's not as fast."
musictheory,3e2k4y,deadpigeontrio,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:30 2015 UTC,"Not all of it is 4/4. Think formally, the opening section does not reconcile in 4 beat patterns each time. Each permutation of that section (there are three total) has this same beat pattern."

musictheory,3e07a2,chunter16,10,Tue Jul 21 01:57:50 2015 UTC,"Funny you mention Pokemon!! I'm actually doing a thesis on it (1st gen) exactly because I find the music so complex and interesting. A lot of the music in Pokemon (especially the battle themes) are especially chromatic and feature interesting chords (bVII comes up a lot).   Part of my work involves transcribing the music from the game, and I'm constantly amazed at what I find. I was so clueless as a kid when I played the game. I'm in the middle of Mt. Moon Cave right now, and the piece is pretty much all augmented chords and chromatic sequences + time signature changes (4/4, 3/4, 2/4).

The main theme is only played once before it is reiterated in a modulated form and it only appears to be a half step higher. It's so subtle that it sounds almost exactly the same. It does this by using the direction of the melody to naturally drive itself there.  I'll give honorable mention to the Lance battle theme as that modulates the most out of all of them, but it doesn't do so explosively and very suddenly."

BTW, transcribing can be a useful exercise, but you should know that if you just want to analyse the music you can get everything in MIDI format. How can I get a (digital) copy of your thesis when you're done?"
musictheory,3e07a2,LarryLarington,2,Tue Jul 21 12:50:43 2015 UTC,"Oh my god so jealous. I wish my music program incorporated more video game music back when I was in high school. A cappella arrangements of Pokemon music would sound so great.  And what do you exactly mean by getting the music in MIDI format? The original soundtrack was programmed for the Game Boy sound chip (two pulse wave channel, one wave table channel, and one noise channel) which doesn't use MIDI. Rather composers had to create files with ""instructions"" for the sound chip using tracker software.   If you're referring to fan transcriptions (which there are a lot out there), I find that the majority of them don't take into account the sound chip limitations and thus miss some of the finer details of the pieces. There's also the possibility of inaccuracies, so I find that transcribing everything myself ensures I'm not taking anything for granted and double checking quality. And like you said, transcribing is actually a really fun and helpful exercise (my ear isn't that great).  Also really glad to hear you're interested in my thesis! I'll definitely share it here once it's completed, but that won't be for a while unfortunately. I'm doing all prep work for my proposal right now and assuming I get my project approved, I would complete it April 2016. I know it's a long time from now, but I promise I'll have something worth sharing. I've already transcribed 37/51 of the soundtrack and boy will there be a lot to talk about. ;)"
musictheory,3e07a2,ITwitchToo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"There are programs like gbsplay which read the sound chip instructions and can output as either a rendered WAV or outputting a MIDI file. As you say, the MIDI file won't actually sound anything like what comes out of the GameBoy because of the different instruments, but the MIDI file can still give you the exact notes that are being played.  I'll PM you a zip with a set of mids that I just generated with gbsplay."

I've transcribed a lot of game music for my band. Sometimes I use MIDIs as a guide but I always have to check them and almost always find mistakes.  I use vgmusic.com. Great resource but check the MIDI before you do any theses!
musictheory,3e07a2,LarryLarington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:28:57 2015 UTC,Yeah absolutely. I rarely use anything off vgmusic since they do tend to be inaccurate. And since my project depends on the accuracy of the transcriptions I find doing them all myself is the safest bet.

musictheory,3e07a2,xiipaoc,4,Tue Jul 21 02:46:01 2015 UTC,"Well, given that it stays within the confides of atonality and the notes follow a seemingly chaotic rhythm that flow far too quickly, the progression seems to be impossible to discern without sheet music. Since this music is created by a random note generator, the listening experience changes upon restarting the game. Thus, sheet music notation does not exist for this song and cannot exist, which makes it impossible for proper harmonic analysis."

I happen to absolutely love the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack (except Eveline Novakovic's DKC3, but David Wise's DKC3 is good), though the harmony isn't exactly complex.  It's got other redeeming features.  But if you want really good, really interesting harmony, Chrono Trigger ALL THE FUCKING WAY, man."

In general, i think you are more likely to get slash chords on such trakcs in general in older video game music at least.  Slash chords in general are chords that have a note other then the root as the lowest note, and in this context, it means notes other than notes in the chord as the lowest note (C/Db)"
musictheory,3e07a2,drakethatsme,2,Tue Jul 21 05:26:07 2015 UTC,"Pilotwings was basically Koji Kondo using his jazz training, which he didn't get to do in Mario and Zelda.  It was a launch title for the SNES (though not for the Super Famicom), so it was a chance to do something completely different.  It's been something like 20 years since I actually played Pilotwings, so I don't remember much of the music (I do remember the tune that plays when you die, because I got to do that REALLY OFTEN); it's only in retrospect that it strikes me as different from the more usual adventurous music of the previous era."

Time-based music (as opposed to pulse-based) like that is extremely difficult to piece together when you don't have a good idea of what else is going on around you, and when the harmonies (or lack thereof) provide no direction, it can be maddening to try to line everything up like it's supposed to be."

musictheory,3e32rf,DannyMk,3,Tue Jul 21 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"The musical alphabet is ABCDEFG, and a diatonic scale uses one of each note.  So a chromatic scale isn't diatonic because you'll use multiple of one letter.  Ex: C C# D D# and so on.  Diatonic will only have one of each letter.  Major or minor is fine.  Ex: G A B C D E F# (G major, only one of each note)  Ex: C D Eb F G Ab Bb (C natural minor, only one of each note)  Hope that clears things up a little bit.

musictheory,3e32rf,jaydomino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:10 2015 UTC,"A tetrachord is a collection of four notes that span a perfect fourth. The Greeks used the tetrachord system to tune their lyres (greek harps), and categorize melodies, and build larger scales.  The Greek tonal system used three types of tetrachords: diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic. The diatonic tetrachord used two tones and a semitone, the chromatic tetrachord used two semitones and a minor 3rd, and the enharmonic tetrachord used two quarter tones and a major 3rd.   Traditional Western tonality developed from an offshoot of Greek tonality that dealt with just the Diatonic tetrachord.   To build a larger diatonic scale, you would add a whole tone to the tetrachord creating an interval of a perfect fifth: A B C D E, for instance. A seven note octave scale can be created by linking a tetrachord and a pentachord: A B C D + D E F G A = A B C D E F G A. You would specifically add pentachords and tetrachords together in such a way that any tetrachord subdivision of that scale would be diatonic:   A B C D  B C D E C D E F E F G A G A B C   Note that F G A B is not itself a tetrachord because F - B is a tritone, not a P4."

Are you just concerned about the diagnostic, or are you interested in more depth than a typical Western Music Appreciation course? Any college-level Music Appreciation textbook is probably going to give you adequate information, a very quick and dirty cross section of centuries of Western music organized by era with a few examples of the most prominent composers and styles from each. Of course, if you're serious about having a Masters' level of understanding, knowing that Mozart and Haydn and Beethoven were all Classical, and that Mozart used the sonata-allegro from isn't really going to be all that comprehensive.   I've read A History of Western Music by Burkholder, Music: an Appreciation by Roger Kamien, and Anthology for Musical Analysis by Charles Burkhart. Either of the first two are fine as reads, and the third is full of excellent examples. They'd pretty easily get you through the diagnostic, but you'd have at most a sophomore level of understanding of music history. For in-depth, you'd want books specializing in eras or composers and styles. My Beethoven Companion alone is three times the length of either of the music appreciation textbooks above.   Congratulations on starting your Masters program."

The book ends with a few early 20th century English composers crammed into a single chapter. There is a huge bias favoring the 19th century in the interim. There isn't much discussion on the composers' musical contributions either, from what I can deign from previews. I'm looking more for something that includes the development of organum through Léonin and Pérotin, and the stylistic evolution of frottola to madrgial, for instance."

Harmony/Melody - you can create harmonic progressions and build melodies out of them Listen/Imitate - you can listen to various music ideas in different pieces and twist these around until you like what you have and it sounds unique Listen/Study - sometimes you just have to sit down with a score and figure out what the composer did Explore Concepts - sometimes you need to expand your palette when you grow tired of generating what feels like the same material over and over again Teach - there are web forums all over the place where people like yourself are learning and trying to grow who might benefit from being taught something the way you understand it, so don't be afraid to go help others out Find more tutorials - there are always more things to learn, so don't stop learning the craft or how people go about creating... you might find that using a 12-sided dice roll as a way to come up with pitches might just get you started on your next great piece if you sit and work through a process you're unfamiliar with, so try everything   I think in the end, you want to graduate from being a beginner to becoming a novice, someone who is actively writing and discovering what your aesthetic sense is - what your ""sound"" sounds like.

Ab and G# sound the same, but in this context, they communicate different chords. G-G# would be what we call augmented unison.   ""Second"" signifies two notes that are one step away from each other(G-A), and ""minor"" signifies a half-step as opposed to a whole step (G-Ab).  ""Unison"" signifies the same note (G-G), and ""augmented"" indicates the 2nd note is raised by a half step (G-G#).  It's semantics, really; but with written music, you have to be very specific."

So in the first chord, basically the D-flat is a common tone between it and the following chord, and the other two notes (E and G) are chromatic lower neighbor tones to the F and A-flat. Chromatic lower neighbors have a lot of pull back up to the notes a half step above them; they function sort of like leading tones. So even though this doesn't make a typical cadential chord, it still has a lot of pull back to I because of the tension in those chromatic lower neighbors."

From this it follows that we don't identify a key simply by tallying up the notes and seeing what scale they fit in to (besides, this wouldn't narrow things down much, because theoretically any note of a scale could be the tonic note). We need more information: the harmonies, and the harmonic progressions, cadences, and phrases they take part in; melodic motives and patterns; and so on."

musictheory,3dwpjw,Ebans,7,Mon Jul 20 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"For me the one thing that has greatly enhanced my ability to hear harmonies is simply studying a lot of music theory and studying a lot of music (and listening very carefully).  This may sound unhelpful. But here's an analogy: imagine a person dictating a letter to you in a language that you don't understand. You hear a string of sounds, snippets of which you may recognize (phonemes, words, maybe even phrases), but you can't assemble them into any sort of gestalt, because you lack familiarity with the sorts of grammatical and semantic schemata that would make up such a gestalt. By contrast, it is easier to take dictation in a language you are intimately familiar with precisely because you have a large repertoire of such schemas that help you process what you are hearing and take it in larger chunks that you find meaningful. You perceive not just individual phonemes, words, or phrases, but whole sentences and even whole paragraphs.  There are good reasons to believe that listening to music works very much the same way: your ability to understand what you are hearing is contingent upon your ability to interpret larger chunks of information as meaningful. You may be able to scrape by transcribing a melody by trying to hear each note individually and poke at a keyboard until you find the right one, but this will be a slow and painstaking process, and in some cases it will be impossible to do (say, if the notes are going by very quickly); but if you can hear a melody not as just a succession of individual notes but as a series of larger chunks (motives, sub-phrases, phrases) made up of certain patterns (scales, arpeggios), you'll transcribe much more quickly and effortlessly. Likewise, you may be able to transcribe a chord progression by focusing on each individual chord and trying to hear its root and quality, but you're sure to fare better if you are able to recognize common harmonic progressions (I-IV-V-I), cadences, sequences, etc.  Studying music theory can give you many valuable tools for understanding what you are hearing, be it notes, intervals, scales, chords, chord progressions, forms, and so on. I realized this when, after many years of studying harmony, I suddenly noticed that I recognized a lot of what I was hearing when I listened to music (""hey, that's a deceptive cadence""). So the better you understand music theory (that is, the better you understand music), the easier it will be to hear complex things like harmonic progression. But just reading theory won't be enough; you'll have to apply what you learn to what you hear (listening to music while following along with a score, and analyzing the music, is a great way to do this). You should also drill interval, scale, and chord identification. It also doesn't hurt to try writing some music, tinkering with things and seeing how they sound. No matter what, it will take a lot of time and diligent practice for you to develop your ear.  EDIT: Also, check out the FAQ for more ear training improvement strategies and resources."
musictheory,3dwpjw,Cdesese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! The FAQ link you posted is also incredibly helpful!  Would you mind to elaborate what you mean by studying music theory? I'm fairly comfortable working with music theory on paper and reading sheet music, and I can probably work out the Roman Numerals of some song's chords, recognize a mode that Debussy used in his piece and tell that a D7-G7-C is a secondary dominant leading to the dominant in the C Key on paper, but I wouldn't be able to tell if someone just played a I-IV-V-I progression on an instrument.   Am I understanding the term ""music theory"" in the wrong way, or is my ear training just ridiculously behind the understanding of my theory?   You may be able to scrape by transcribing a melody by trying to hear each note individually and poke at a keyboard until you find the right one, but this will be a slow and painstaking process, and in some cases it will be impossible to do (say, if the notes are going by very quickly)   This. Sometimes I feel ridiculed by the fact that I can play a 20 minute piano sonata but wouldn't be able to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star without spending 10 minutes trying to work out all the notes and chord bit by bit (or recognize, without my instrument, that the score in front of me is actually Happy Birthday to you) :(  Thank you again!"
musictheory,3dwpjw,Cdesese,2,Mon Jul 20 10:52:06 2015 UTC,"When I say ""studying music theory"" I mean basically what you describe. But it's important that it not just be something you do ""on paper,"" that you learn not only how to recognize something like I-IV-V-I in a score but in sound as well. If you harmonize something, play your harmonization on the piano, and sing the bass line, the melody, the inner parts; learn solfege and practice sight singing; consider joining a choir (singing in choirs is another thing that I feel has developed my ear)."

It comes more quickly for some than for others, so don't lose patience.    Another related question is whether there are some good resources/harmonically simple songs for me to test my skills in real life with real music and check whether I'm actually right.   Sit down with your instrument of choice and learn some songs, but don't just memorize notes and rhythms good enough that you can regurgitate them on command. Familiarize yourself with how these particular cadences sound, how the voices lead from one chord to another, etc. and you will really get better at hearing things right off the bat because you will have played them before."

musictheory,3dwpjw,xiMbd03u1,2,Mon Jul 20 10:38:13 2015 UTC,"The problem is that the program seems to only train you by having you listen to piano block chords, which is fantastic if the song uses them but isn't the case for 90% of the time.   This is why I think those programs are complete bullshit.  Real music almost never has isolated intervals or chords.  You're much better off with real music.  Lots of people complain that they use those programs and get no results.  Maybe it helps some people but not others, I don't know, but I would say that if it actually helps you, you're basically squeezing water out of a stone.  A very dry stone.  Real music is the way to go, because real music is what you care about anyway.  What I've done is transcription -- write down the melody and the harmony.  Not every part, of course; that's really, really hard.  Just the basic melody and the chords.  To get the chords, you listen for the bass, and once you have that, try to find other notes in the chord to guide you.  If you're stuck, you can use the piano to play stuff until you get it right.  You can even stick the music in GarageBand or something and slow it down without changing the pitch (that's possible to do, believe it or not) if it will help you transcribe.  It's slow going at first, but it gets easier.  As for harmonically simple songs, well, I don't know what genre you're into, but unless it's something specifically experimental, you're probably good for almost any piece of music you run into."
musictheory,3dwpjw,upsidedowntophat,2,Mon Jul 20 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Many popular styles of music are almost entirely written diatonic to the key. Obviously, Jazz and Classical are two major exceptions. If you intend to identify pop, rock, and other such progressions, you can often do well by identifying the root note of the chord, then determining the structure of the chord using roman numeral analysis--e.g. the I, IV, and V are major; the ii, iii, vi are minor; etc... Alterations such as the major 6th of Harmonic Minor may trip you up at first, but you'll figure it out pretty quickly just by paying attention to conventions.  Playing music helps you learn to hear progressions more easily, as long as you translate the chords back to roman numerals so that you understand their relationship to the key, and not just see them as a sequence of chords. The best example I can think of is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ  Once you know that progression (I V vi IV), you will hear it all over the place. Just identify the key, and you immediately know the chords. There are other very common chord progressions in pop music and other genres (like ii V I in Jazz) that you can learn to recognize.  There is a point in ear training where you simply have to be able to pick out the intervals. For example, some music is relatively sparse and doesn't have a strongly defined chordal structure. Some music may sound like it's all the same root chord, and rely on alterations to create movement. Some music may have essential additions to chords, without which the song just doesn't sound right. At this point, you just have to get good at Solfege. But you can go a long way just by becoming familiar with roman numeral analysis and the conventions of the style you're working in."

This is called Schenkerian analysis, after the famous Viennese theorist Heinrich Schenker, or graphic/linear analysis. It's a fairly complex system for observing the different structural levels of a composition. In a nutshell, Schenker's notation illustrates the deeper connections between long-range tonal structures that make up a composition. It deliberately does not show ""surface-level"" detail, like the actual ""notes"" from the score, but it does go quite a bit deeper than a traditional ""harmonic-root"" analysis by showing how the harmonies are created by voice-leading and linear movement.  It's a pretty high-level subject honestly, you'd need to study a number of graduate level texts, and probably a lot of personal tutoring from an expert in the subject. If I were you, I'd learn all the chords, keys, and suspensions first."

They're meant to be arrangements for the non-professional church congregation, and follow the original hymns quite closely.   You won't find any of the sophisticated techniques of invertible counterpoint which Bach displays so prominently in the Well-Tempered Clavier, Art of the Fugue, Musical Offering, etc. If you're interested in how the fugue was studied and taught during his time period, Alfred Mann's Study of Fugue is an excellent resource."

musictheory,3dx3f8,vornska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:45 2015 UTC,"Right. It's not like Bach was renowned for being the greatest master of the intricacies of this art or anything. Because being able to develop inventions that perfectly interweave with themselves in every permutation of inversion, transposition, augmentation, and diminution in multiple voices, while being totally subsumed into the transcendent tonal architecture of immense emotional and spiritual power is a rather pedestrian musical achievement. Of course, Bach himself said that anybody can do what he could, if they worked as hard as he."
musictheory,3dx3f8,klaviersonic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:22 2015 UTC,I don't think u/wysiwygh8r was insulting JS Bach; rather he was saying that fugue & invertible counterpoint don't make him great.

musictheory,3dx3f8,vornska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right: to invert a phrase of 6 tones at the octave is a ""pretty unimpressive device on its own."" To do the same with 5 parts over the course of 100 bars of the most imaginative tonal, harmonic, and melodic variety, while still maintaining the unity of the original theme, is much more impressive.  The fugue is an immense challenge of musical skill and craftsmanship; it's why Bach was interested in the form long after the style gallant rendered the polyphonic tradition  anachronistic. It's not the fugue per se that is the achievement. It's the level of mastery over the numerous devices of imitation and transformation, and the fact that the incredible intellectual feats of mathematical calculation and far-sighted planning required to coordinate them are totally subservient to Bach's musical imagination.  Not that Bach really needs any defending, but it seems a bit absurd to suggest that ""a couple semesters of study"" suffice to fully grasp the principles behind skillful polyphonic composition."

To answer the OP, it may not be free, but if you can track down a harmony teacher from the Boulanger tradition, he/she will have the sort of Bach analyses you're looking for.

Writing over the barline is very common in marching band/drum corps music, since it's simpler to look at and understand that the figure is supposed to ""suspend"" the pulse. Rhythmically, the two bars would sound like ""1 and 2 and 3 and-trip-let and-trip-let and-trip-let and-trip-let and 4 and"".

musictheory,3dursz,wegwirfst,4,Mon Jul 20 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"You are incorrect. There are 4 beats in each bar.  Basically, the second note of that triple straddles the bar. It is halfway in one measure, and halfway in the other. So, you have 4 8th note, for two beats, 3 8th note triplets for the third beat, then 1 8th note and 1 and 1/2 triplet 8th notes for the 4th beat.

If you have the notes G, E, & C, the only way to stack them in thirds is if the C is on bottom. If the C is in the middle or on top, you end up with a fourth in the chord. This is useful if you're trying to analyze music. Let's try a different chord. Let's say in the bass line is an F#, the tenor line is A, alto on D, and soprano on another F#. Take inventory of all the notes in the chord: F#, A, D. Now rearrange them so that if you were to stack them they'd all be stacked in thirds. You can use some scratch staff paper if you have trouble visualizing it, but you'd eventually come to the conclusion that the only way to stack it in thirds is if you draw the D on the bottom, followed by the F# and the A on top, which is a D Major chord (so D is the root). But since the bass line is on the F# (the third of the chord), this chord has been rearranged into first inversion.   The same practice also applies for seventh chords, just stack into thirds to find the root."
musictheory,3dvqhd,Cdesese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:20 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks I understand what you mean. About seventh chords, is it possible to use a dominant 7th chord in the key of C major? The notes would be  A,C,E F# and F# isn't in the key"
musictheory,3dvqhd,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"The dominant seventh chord found most often in C Major is G7.   What you have described looks like it is probably an A minor chord, but with a raised six. Any E to any F is a second, any E to any G is a third, therefore in order to have an A seventh chord you need A, some kind of C, some kind of E, and some kind of G. The enharmonic equivalent of F# is Gb, so it would be a seventh chord if written that way (it would be a half diminished seventh chord, to be specific). There's no reason it can't appear in C major music, though the chord isn't diatonic to the key.   I myself am new to understanding a lot of this, so if I have a wrong understanding of anything or if someone has further insight to the purpose this chord could potentially serve, I'd love further comment."
musictheory,3dvqhd,BlackNotesIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:26 2015 UTC,"Ok so technically you are saying that even though F# isn't in the key, since it is the same as G flat, it can substituted?"
musictheory,3dvqhd,Cdesese,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:00:19 2015 UTC,"Ok; for now, we'll ignore everything but the triad, yeah? So, there are three possible inversions, right? C at the bottom, E at the bottom, and G at the bottom. The top two notes aren't important - only the bottom one. C is root position as I said before, E on the bottom is called 1st inversion, and G on the bottom is called 2nd inversion. If you play E, G, C, you'll notice that it sounds very different from C, E, G. Same with G, C, E. They are a little harder to identify by ear if you don't know what to look for, but when you arpeggiate the chord (ie, play the notes individually from bottom to top), you can look for the interval between the first and second note, which determines the inversion. C, E is a major third, E, G is a minor third, and G, C is a perfect fourth.  Generally, we want to use the most compact voicing possible for keyboards (ie, G, C, E, as opposed to G, E, C) but different instrumentation calls for different voicings. In addition, depending on the range of the instrument you're writing for, different intervals may sound muddy. Giving that whole triad to the bass sounds pretty bad!"

One thing you should change are the measure-long beams. The beams should show the quarter-note pulse. You could get away with beaming the first four quarters and the last three quarters (this would also show how you want the measure subdivided).

Every time he tries to talk about an instrument and its particular quirks, he says stuff that's just blatantly wrong.  Edit: Some specifics:   He claims that high G is the highest good note for piccolo, which is untrue.  It comfortably plays several notes higher. He tries to sound smart about clarinet registers, but doesn't seem to know that the middle octave concert G is a throat tone and isn't well suited to play a loud stinger like how that piece starts. He makes a big deal out of a high A for trumpet, trying to show off what he knows about transposition and such, but he has it completely backwards.  Written A is the note that's sort of fidgety and can be out of tune, especially on C trumpets, but a written B (which is what it would be for a Bb trumpet) is a perfectly good note. He claims that concert D5 is a dangerously high note for horn, which it isn't.  Don't ask horn players to play it gently, but for a soaring line like that it's totally fine. He says something about oboes being flat, which is just silly.  Then he writes a low D, which is a bad note to ask for in that context. Double stop octaves in the timpani is just weird.   Also, he makes a lot of comments relating to balance that are really more due to his crappy synth sounds and the audio mixer settings."

And then finally, ""G, Em, C, D"".  Each has it's own emotional feel.  Playing a minor chord all by itself has a certain emotional feel and then placing it within a different chordal context has a certain emotional feel.  It comes down to what our brain has processed recently and how it is reacting to that when the next chord comes up.  It's complex but that's just a part of the music.  :)  Another way of explaining it, which I feel is both more and less correct, is that playing G, Em, C, and D puts one in firmly in the mode of D-major.

I'm not a huge Radiohead fan so I'm not familiar with their key changes, but just in general, it's much more frequently harder to say definitively which chord is the tonic in popular music than in classical music. It can be difficult to say whether a piece is in C major using vi–IV–I–V or in A minor using I–VI–III–VII, for example. The commonness of modal music in rock makes it even more complex, so that you have to ask yourself if something is I–♭VII–IV in G mixolydian or V–IV–I in C major.

I can have music that is centered on C that uses a variety of different scales (C major, C minor, C Mixolydian, C Dorian, C ""acoustic"", etc.), even moving fluidly between them without really ever settling on one or the other. Provided that the pitch class of the tonic note remains the same, everything else is mutable, including all of the other notes of the scale and the chords made up from them.   Which would imply that relative keys are similar enough to be confused for one another.   A difference of tonal center is a big difference. C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, F Lydian, G Mixolydian, A Aeolian, and B Locrian, all sound very different from one another, even though they all draw their pitches from the same abstract diatonic collection. Relative-related keys may share the same pitches and chords, but what those pitches and chords mean with respect to the tonal center is very different. I don't hear a G chord in D Dorian the same way I hear it in C major.   No one is going to confuse A major for A minor.   That is why a study of key usage ought to treat parallel-related modes as the same key.   How would that change anything?   C major and A minor are not the same key. They are two separate keys. As I said above, scale and key are not synonymous: they represent different aspects of music, and they can be tracked independently of each other. By collapsing all relative keys together, this data only really tells us what scales are being used, not what the actual keys are. ""C/Am"" could mean C major or A minor, but it might also be E Phyrgian, or any other ""white notes"" mode.

musictheory,3dqm5x,Kai_Daigoji,4,Sat Jul 18 18:31:29 2015 UTC,And I thought I was overthinking it   No one is going to confuse A major for A minor.   That is why a study of key usage ought to treat parallel-related modes as the same key.    You're not thinking like a musician

musictheory,3dqm5x,Zerocrossing,6,Sat Jul 18 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree that grouping the relative major and minor keys doesn't make sense - if there are 9 songs in G minor and 1 song in Bb major, that's a significant distinction.  But grouping parallel major and minor keys wouldn't necessarily be better.  Yes there are some songs that seem to have moments of parallel major / minor ambiguity, like Exit Music or Planet Telex, but I wouldn't group Street Spirit (A minor) with Fake Plastic Trees (A major).  In general, I'm not sure what to make of these graphs - are they based on the key signatures of parent scales or are modal pieces assigned to major or minor based on the home chord?  For example, how was Karma Police identified?  The opening section is A dorian with a brief inflection of A minor.  The middle section is essentially IV - V - I in G, with a chromatic F# chord at the end of the phrase.  That F# arguably functions as a V leading to a closing section that starts with a B minor chord, but could be interpreted as B dorian due to an E major chord.  It doesn't seem that a single relative major / minor pairing can really capture the tonality of this song.  Or how about The Tourist?  The tonal center is clearly B, but the frequent use of the flat seventh scale degree (A-natural) in F# minor chords and A major chords makes a strong case for B mixolydian / an E major parent scale.  I think Radiohead has some very interesting harmonic choices in their music, but to appreciate them I think we would need to see a more detailed breakdown of what's happening within the songs."

musictheory,3dqm5x,Bromskloss,5,Sun Jul 19 05:05:57 2015 UTC,Looks like they've been playing a lot in drop lately.   I think they grouped the relatives together simply because they're enharmonic and the author perhaps didn't feel like debating the tonality of each song. It's just for simplicity's sake.

musictheory,3dtp5y,Zombater,19,Sun Jul 19 10:39:11 2015 UTC,"If you look at the ""Ionian"" scale (i.e. the traditional major scale) in D, you have:  D E F# G A B C# D   From that you can build up the triad by stacking 3rds, i.e. the 3rd and the 5th (count up in 3s, including the note you start on):  D F# A   You can continue beyond this and stack another 3rd beyond the 5th, which is the 7th:  D F# A C#   Now, look at the intervals between the root and the notes. The 3rd is a major 3rd (4 semitones), the 5th is perfect (7 semitones) and the 7th is major (11 semitones). So this chord is called Dmaj7. ""D"" on its own means ""D major"" (i.e. with the major 3rd), ""maj7"" means that the major 7th is added to the triad.  Now, if we build a scale using the same notes, but starting on the 5th, i.e. starting on the A, it is called the ""Mixolydian"":  A B C# D E F# G A   And then if we build up the chord by stacking 3rds:  A C# E G   Look at the intervals and you can see that the 3rd is major (4 semitones), the 5th is perfect (7 semitones) and the 7th is minor (10 semitones). So, we call this A7, which is called ""A dominant 7"". ""7"" without the ""maj"" means that the 7 is minor, but because the A doesn't have a ""m"" then the chord is major.  Now, finally, if we start on the 2nd of the original scale we get what is called the ""Dorian"":  E F# G A B C# D E   Build the chord:  E G B D   And look at the intervals: the 3rd now is minor (3 semitones), the 5th is still perfect (7 semitones) and the 7th is minor (10 semitones). We call this Em7. Em means that the 3rd is minor and the 7 means that the 7 is minor. This is called ""E minor 7"""

The reason I built A7 from the V of the D Ionian scale (i.e. A Mixolydian) is because if you stick to modal organisation from the major scale, then only the Mixolydian has a minor 7 and a major 3.  The modes are Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian and Locrian. If you just look at the intervals of chords built on these scales, you will see that:  Ionian: maj3, perf5, maj7 Dorian: min3, perf5, min7 Phrygian: min3, perf5, min7 Lydian: maj3, perf5, maj7 Mixolydian: maj3, perf5, min7 Aeolian: min3, perf5, min7 Locrian: min3, dim5, min7   So, the mixolydian is the only mode based on the major scale that you can build a dominant 7 chord from."

musictheory,3dtp5y,Cdesese,3,Sun Jul 19 11:00:52 2015 UTC,"Intervals are simply the distance between 2 notes and are measured by the number of half steps between them.  Forgive my format cause I'm on mobile but think of it like this in terms of half steps...  0 prime  1 minor second (like C to Db)  2 major second ( C to D)  3 minor third (C to Eb)  4 major third (C to E)  5 perfect 4th (C to F)  ***6 augmented 4th/diminished 5th (C to F#/Gb)  7 perfect 5th (C to G)  8 minor 6th (C to Ab)  9 major 6th (C to A)  10 minor 7th (C to Bb)  11 major 7th (C to B)  Now with this, let's say you had C to Eb and C to D#. Both of these are 3 half steps, so they'd both be a minor 3rd right? No. The number of the interval indicates how many letters from one note to the next. So C to some type of E would be some type of third, in this case a minor third.  So C to D# would have to be some type of second, in this case an augmented second.  The number is referred to as the QUANTITY and the indication of major or minor is called the QUALITY.  hope this makes it clearer."

I was merely pointing out that C could also be taken as the root, because it is a tritone-transpositionally symmetrical chord (transpose it up or down a tritone and you get the same pitch classes).  You can argue that the spelling favors an F#-rooted interpretation, but what about the fact that the melody clearly arpeggiates a C major chord, and seems to treat the F# chord tones as subordinate to the C chord tones?  Besides, the F#7b9(#11) interpretation requires treating C as an enharmonic for B#. I would say that the spelling of the chord only matters in that Stravinsky was pretty clearly thinking of it as a combination of two triads, F# and C (not some jazzy extended dominant)."
musictheory,3dso6m,Cdesese,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:06 2015 UTC,I agree that Stravinsky's use of this chord is non-functional. I thought OP might be interested in another potential use of the same set of pitches.

musictheory,3dso6m,RajinIII,5,Sun Jul 19 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Ugh. The Pettrushka chord is a bitonal entity. Don't try to turn it into some extended jazz bastardization. Don't try to order it as a scale. You're missing the point if you do any of that.  Look at how the Petrushka chord is used in the ballet. Notice a few things: the motif, ignoring the tritone transposition, is a major triad arpeggiated. This is a bugle call. In the canon of Western art music, this is the sort of sound that we associate with the hero. Here are a couple of leitmotives from Wagner's Ring cycle that use the same language: 1, 2  I won't compare these outside of their pitch content, as the use of all of these motives in their respective narratives bears little relation. I will point out that this sort of fanfare is an archetypal symbol. Stravinsky is saying that Petrushka is the protagonist, the hero, but by smashing two grossly incongruous triads together, Stravinsky imparts a sad irony on the character.  Petrushka, a stock character in Russian puppet theater, is a jester used in slapstick comedy. In Stravinsky's ballet, the puppetmaster brings three puppets to life: a ballerina, a moor, and Petrushka. Petrushka is enamored by the ballerina, but she rejects him in favor of the moor. Petrushka goes to challenge the moor and is killed in the fight. At the end, the ghost of Petrushka thumbs his nose at the puppetmaster who gave him life in the first place.  As much as Petrushka wants to be the hero, to get the girl, and save the day, it's not going to happen. Yet for all of his imperfection (once again, symbolized by the use of bitonal technique), no one can take his spirit.  On the musical level, note also that the ""Petrushka chord"" is not merely a C triad and an F# triad. The F# triad is inverted. This is to get more intervals out of the juxtaposition. If both are in root position, then you only get diminished fifths: F# C, A# E, C# G. Boring. When inverted, more intervals pop out: A# C (d3 or M2), C# E (m3), F# G (m2). The inversion of one of the arpeggios is every bit as important as the tritone distance between the roots of the chords."
musictheory,3dso6m,Xenoceratops,0,Sun Jul 19 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"The Pretrushka chord is a bitonal entity.   This is nitpicky, but I don't think that ""bitonal"" is a good description of the Petrushka chord. I don't think the context gives us much reason to view the chord as representing two simultaneous keys, but rather merely two simultaneous chords. Perhaps something like ""bichordal"" would be better: it emphasizes the composite structure of the chord, but avoids overstatement of the significance of its constituent chords that results from treating them as representing simultaneous keys. I'm not denying the possibility of bitonality, I just don't think it applies here. In fact, I think it's fairly easy to interpret the Petrushka chord passage ""monotonally"" as a kind of C major, in which a C major tonic triad is embellished by an F# major triad.  Also, while I agree that it doesn't make much sense to view the Petrushka chord itself as a scale, it does have a very (structurally and historically) important scalar context in the octatonic scale. Stravinsky was a disciple of Rimsky-Korsakov, a composer who very systematically explored the harmonic possibilities of the octatonic scale in his music (in Russia the octatonic scale is called the ""Rimsky-Korsakov scale""), including the possibility of pairing two triads a tritone apart. And R-K very consistently used the octatonic scale (and harmonies and progressions drawn from it) to depict the otherworldly, inhuman, and supernatural in his music (especially his operas). Stravinsky was among many R-K students who inherited his octatonic musical/dramatic technique, and this inheritance may be nowhere else better exemplified than in the Petrushka chord."

I find that the D9, however, does sound a bit out of place. The only thing I could think of would be to change it to a Bm7 to complete a ii-V7-I. But, that does use that Bm7 again which sounds a bit clumsy, maybe a different voicing could work. The ii-V7-I also sounds a tiny bit cheesy.  I had a little play around and I liked switching the Bm7 and D9 around, you might too. So...  D9, Gm7 add 4, Bm7, E7 add -9, Amaj7.  Hope some of that helped."

You have two options here, one is to simply ignore the 5th string until you're past the 5th fret in any key that doesn't have g natural, and the second is to retune or capo the 5th string for the new key.

musictheory,3dq8cr,lovegiblet,2,Sat Jul 18 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"What I know about playing the banjo comes more from my father, he liked folk in the 60s and played a tenor banjo.  Banjo tunes to an open chord that may or may not be the root of the key you are playing in, with the strength of the instrument is letting the strings you finger interplay with the strings plucked open. Any plucked instrument can do this, but the banjo's tone lends itself to it.  This means that it will be difficult for you to play notes that clash with open strings. That doesn't mean you can't do it sometimes and get a good sound, but that your natural tendency is going to be just as you say: stick to simple, diatonic chords and don't change the key.  If you want to practice breaking out of that, try playing in keys that seem incompatible with you open strings more. For example, if you tune open G, try A major or F# minor, and see how you can incorporate your open strings. You don't have to become Bela Fleck or Pickin on AC/DC, but consider learning to play other styles on your banjo even if they don't sound quite right: you're bound to find one or two things you can make work in your music."

I think I will dig around and try to work within keys that have a G natural for now. I have recently ordered an on-the-neck tuner to retune on the fly in the case that I'd fall in love with A major or F# minor. I think due to habit I would have trouble playing in any key in which I left out-of-key open notes tuned as such on my banjo. Though if it becomes that much of an issue I could retune.  I am practicing all styles of banjo playing as well. I find that just as you said there is value in all of them regardless of the music. Thank  you for the input.

My usual strategy for getting out of a rut is to find music that inspires or intrigues me, try to figure out what's going on, and then assimilate those sounds into my own improvisations or compositions.  I'd be happy to discuss creative ways to incorporate the 5th string, though if you're getting spikes, it might be enough to work on using those for a while.  Here's a simple piece called For Sascha by Béla Fleck:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1nraTF0Et4  It uses Bill Keith's / Bobby Thompson's melodic style, i.e., creating a linear melody but not using the same string for consecutive notes.  The 5th string is a useful stepping stone in this style.  This piece is in Eb major, and the 5th string is fretted a few times."

I guess that the descend from C#min, Cmaj7 towards Bminor is some sort of half-assed tritone substitution (the Cmaj7 should really be a C7).  C#min is not a diatonic chord in B minor.

musictheory,3dqpg8,nfw22,3,Sat Jul 18 15:09:27 2015 UTC,"A melody could be defined as a single line of pitches, usually played by a single instrument or group of instruments, or sung. A melody is also typically in a relatively high register (that is, relatively high in pitch).  A chord progression is a series of chords (a chord being some combination of simultaneously sounding pitches, usually at least three different pitches). Because chord progressions require multiple pitches sounding together, you either need more than one instrument, or a group of singers, or an instrument that can play multiple notes simultaneously, like a piano or guitar.  Where melody and chord progression overlap is that both have a linear dimension to them: both progress through time. The crucial difference would come down to the fact that a melody is a single line of pitches and a chord progression is multiple lines of pitches sounding together."
musictheory,3dqpg8,Cdesese,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:28:08 2015 UTC,Melody and chord progressions isn't necessarily a good generalization of music. Music is melody and harmony. A lot of notes will overlap at any given point but no one voice needs to be playing an entire chord per se. Maybe in older music you'll find rigid progressions and things but if you analyze pop music you'll find things are more spread out.
musictheory,3dqpg8,nocensts,2,Sat Jul 18 17:46:44 2015 UTC,"Music is melody and harmony.   Isn't that basically the same as ""melody and chord progressions""?"
musictheory,3dqpg8,Cdesese,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe but categorizing music as chord progressions and melody feels limiting to me because of the ambiguity of the phrase ""chord progression"". Melody and harmony are not ambiguous words however. A melody is a dominating voice. Harmony is the supporting cast of voices. You will find many chords being traversed between the combination of those. So... Maybe they're the same but in case OP is confused maybe it helps to use a better naming system.  Basically I want OP to know that there are ways of playing chords in different rhythms and voicings. It may be best to focus on the various harmonies going on in any given phrase of music. You may find the melody was an arpeggio with the base rotating notes of the same chord. In this case how many chords were played? I'm just rambling... I am only trying to help OP, not argue."

musictheory,3dqc29,tjmusic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:26:09 2015 UTC,"Okay, so let's take the key C major. That's all the white keys on the piano starting with C. The notes are C D E F G A B C  Now, if you play those keys in order, but start from D, you're actually playing a ""mode"" of C major. Basically, this just means that you're playing a scale that is derived from another scale. This scale is C major starting from a different note. D E F G A B C D. Another name for this scale is D Dorian.  Now C major has a bunch of these modes, one for each note in the scale. If you play all the white keys from E to E, that's called E Phrygian. If you play all the white keys from F to F, that's F lydian. G to G is G mixolydian. A to A is called A aeolian, otherwise known as A natural minor. B to B is called B locrian.  These are all the modes of the major scale. Now you can move the major scale around. Every major scale has a pattern of whole steps and half steps (WWHWWWH). You can start this pattern on any note. If you start it on G, you'll get G A B C D E F# G. If you start it on E, you'll get E F# G# A B C# D# E. If you find the modes starting from any of these notes, the patterns will still be the same. If we build the G major scale starting from C, we will get C lydian. C D E F# G A B C. Now you can basically take any of those modes and scales and start them on any note. If I want to play B lydian, I could either figure out what major scale it comes from (F# major), or I could think about what I have to do to the B major scale to make B lydian (raise the E to E#). Either way, this will give me the notes B C# D# E# F# G# A# B.  I probably explained that poorly, but you can find explanations for all these things all over the internet."

C2 > G2 = Ascending P5 G2 > C2 = Descending P5  Without octave displacement (doubling the number of toms), a pair of toms only yields one interval.   4 toms = 6 pairs = 6 intervals  The correct answer is 6 toms."

Most harmony texts have you learn to realize chord progressions in four parts, in either a chorale style (four independent voices, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass) or in a keyboard style (bass in the left hand, upper voices in the right hand). It sounds like you're assuming a keyboard style. Just play the bass note of the chord with your left hand and then add those other three notes above it in your right hand, like you described. You'll have a number of options for how the right-hand notes will be positioned.   I'm not quite sure what you mean when you ask ""should all the voices be going in the same direction?"" Are you talking about how the voices should move going from the V chord to the I chord in your cadence? If that is the case, then this is where things get more complicated."
musictheory,3doe8a,Cdesese,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is what I meant with the voice direction thing.  My process when writing cadence chords would be to find the common note in both the V and the I, make sure they're the same octave, and for the other 2 notes in the V chord, I correspond them to closeby notes in the I chord, and I was wondering if they should be ascending or descending (so changing the octaves of the chord tones to achieve this) or if it didnt matter at all  Pardon my wording, might be a little incoherent, I'm still getting used to the language behind theory and whatnot"
musictheory,3doe8a,Cdesese,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:44:10 2015 UTC,"No problem. Thanks for the clarifications.  There is never any obligation that all voices move in the same direction.  As has been mentioned, we strive for smoothness in voice leading (though there are plenty of cases where other considerations force us to favor a less smooth voice leading). This includes, as you describe, keeping common tones in the same voice and octave. And each other chord tone should then move to the nearest chord tone in the next chord. This is sometimes called the ""Law of the Shortest Way.""  Certain notes are required to move in certain ways. For example, the leading tone, the third of a V chord (B in C major) is attracted to the tonic note (C in C major), because of the half-step relation between them, and so when moving from V to I the leading tone usually goes to the tonic. (Of course, this would satisfy the law of the shortest way anyway.) However most rules of voice leading allow the leading tone to move to different note when it is not in an outer voice (bass or soprano).  But there are other things to consider in voice leading: avoidance of parallel fifths and octaves, for instance. Avoiding these sometimes forces you to violate the law of the shortest way."
musictheory,3doe8a,Ryuzaki2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"Your guide is wrong, if that's in 4/4. That would be one and a half, as you said.  For cadence and part-writing you should aim for smooth voice-leading. By the sounds of it, you're writing in keyboard style (you have just one note in the bass). Generally there are no ""rules"" as to which order you should place the notes, because the important thing is how the notes in your V move to I. They don't need to go in the same direction if it makes it easier; the leading tone (B in V) must rise, however to C in I. It'd perhaps be easier to go DGB in chord V, and resolve it to EGC in chord I.   In this example it'd probably be easier to use the C above middle C just for the sake of not having notes crammed together."
musictheory,3doe8a,Cdesese,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:04 2015 UTC,"When you say smooth voice leading, do you mean that each chord tone in V should be a certain distance away from another chord tone in I, or what? (if so, is it specific as to which go to which)  Also, when you say the leading tone (B in V) should rise to the C in I, why is that?  Is it because B is the leading tone in the CMaj scale, or is it a general rule with chord tones and cadences (i.e. if it was a plagal cadence, would you say the A in IV should also rise to the C)?  I'm just trying to learn it on a formulaic level if you understand what I mean. For example, here is me writing a V-I cadence in CMaj https://i.imgur.com/mBW6jlY.png  I put both the bass notes in for each chord, find the shared note (G in this case), make sure they are the same octave, then my question occurs as to how to place the other two notes (i.e. which version of C to use?  which version of E?  Should certain chord tones be under corresponding chord tones in the next chord?  If so which ones?)"
musictheory,3doe8a,Ryuzaki2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:21:36 2015 UTC,Your harmonization of the V-I cadence in C looks good. But there are other options.
musictheory,3doe8a,phearsom_fysic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"Smooth voice leading basically means that the notes move by step (in other words, no leaping from like, E to a high C in the same voice). Generally you want to move to the closest note possible (with the exception of the bass note if you're writing root position chords).  As to why B must rise, it's basically both reasons - B is the leading tone (LT) of C major, and it's just a rule that's used with perfect cadences. I don't think plagal cadences would follow the same manner like you said as an A in IV would generally fall to a G in I (it's closer in terms of distance).  The example that you've given there is pretty good :) that's one example of how you could structure an authentic cadence. As /u/Cdesese said, how the other two notes are to be placed and how to move them and so on is where things get rather tricky, but the one that you've given there is a good one."

The most important thing I believe for voice-leading in chordal movement, which may have been mentioned already, is to move as little as possible. Use as many semitone (half step) and tone (step) movements as possible. Even better is to leave a note where it is.   So moving the B in the G chord up to the C, D up to E, and leaving the G where it is."

You don't necessarily have to be able to solve all your problems in an analysis—sometimes the ""problem"" is what makes it so cool, and I think this is an example. Basically he uses this chord that creates expectations, but then instead of resolving those expectations, he just lets them hang out and sort of disappear, and then he moves on like it didn't happen.  I don't know if I can choose between the analysis of a V/V that doesn't resolve, or of a II♯ that also doesn't resolve (I think of II♯ chords as typically resolving to IV). I can imagine the chord resolving both ways (though my first instinct was that it would move to IV, for some reason, I don't know why)."

Neo-Riemannian theory is a good example, explaining non-functional progressions of root movement by thirds. I don't know of any specific paradigm that uses this progression specifically. However, don't be so quick to abandon voice-leading structures as a potential explanation. There's some pretty far out harmonies in Renaissance counterpoint which deny modern directional analysis! And exact-transposition sequences (for instance, a sequence going EM-AM-F#M-BM-G#M-C#M, or a sequence which doesn't change chord quality to account for key function) were relatively well known in Romantic writing (Brahms uses them well)."

musictheory,3dm0zi,Cdesese,11,Fri Jul 17 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually not unusual.  The prohibition of parallel perfect fifths and octaves has to do with the fact that parallel motion involving these two intervals suggests a doubling of a single part, and thus compromises the independence of the two parts. The reasoning behind this is that because the octave and fifth above a fundamental appear as its nearest overtones, they are nearest to a literal doubling of the fundamental. The fourth above a fundamental, however, is a much more remote overtone, more remote even that the major third, minor seventh, and major ninth. This puts the fourth in a very different category when it comes to parallel motion, since it does not create the same impression of a doubling of the fundamental that fifths and octaves do."

If you had the D-C-B-C line below the A-G-F-E line, then you would indeed have parallel perfect fifths, D-A to C-G, which would be incorrect. But in the voicing I have given, they are parallel perfect fourths, and so they are fine.  It's worth pointing out that it's not the mere sound of parallel perfect fifths that is considered problematic. Some people will erroneously say that parallel perfect fifths are avoided because they were thought to sound ""bad."" This is not the case.

You should check out the Rule of the Octave. This is the way 18th-century musicians learned what chords could harmonize what bass notes. Note that it's not just where the bass note appears in the scale that is important, but how the bass notes moves (i.e., up or down by step).

V7d is fairly common, harmonizing the bass note IV. This chord always resolves to Ib, because the seventh in the bass must resolve down by step.  A Ic chord in a cadence that did not eventually get to V or V7 would be a bit odd.  Second-inversion triads are special, always requiring certain conditions for their use. This is because they form the interval of a fourth with their bass note, and fourths are traditionally dissonances and thus can only be used under certain conditions."

It's about a somewhat over-confident impresario who is contracted to bring Earth's music to various other planets as an experiment in cultural exchange.   From ""Space Opera"" (1964)  Bickel continued. “The point I wish to make is this. Musical symbology is at once simple and complex. A slow soft rhythmical sound is almost universally soothing. A series of shrill brassy staccato tones is likewise exciting. Abstraction on the first level. When we consider chords, chord progressions, tone clusters, melodic structure, then we deal with entities whose symbolic meaning is to a much greater degree a matter of convention.   Even among the various musics of Earth there is no consensus as to the significance of these conventions. We can, if you like, speculate as to a possible congruence of musical symbology among the worlds of the galaxy. It is conceivable, through processes of acculturation, or parallel development —"" he held up a hand as someone started to laugh ""— don’t be too skeptical too soon!   The diatonic scale is not a freak, or a chance discovery! It is based on fundamental harmonic relationships. To exemplify: start with any note at random. For simplicity’s sake C, which we will use as our base tone: the tonic. Even a child’s ear can hear that another C an octave up or down the scale is the most obvious concord. A vibrational relationship of 2:1.   Almost as basic will seem a concord with the vibration ratio 3:2. The note turns out to be G, the so-called dominant. What note occupies the same pragmatic relation to G that G does to C? It turns out to be the note we call D. With D as the tonic A becomes the dominant. With A as the tonic E is the dominant.   Twelve different notes reveal themselves in this way before suddenly we find ourselves back at a note which is very close to C. Shift all these notes into the same octave, tinker and temper a little, and we have our familiar diatonic scale. Nothing mysterious, the most basic rule-of-thumb procedure imaginable.   What is the point of all this?   Simply that it should be no surprise to find a totally strange race on a totally strange planet using instruments similar to our own, employing our own familiar do re mi fa sol la si do.”"

I suspect it is universal, we see a lot of these kind of ratios in ""beautiful"" parts of animals. So it is a given that audio would follow the same principles.   But there are other factors of course whether people or animals will find something nice. Cats for instance don't typically care for our music because their range of hearing is adjusted at a higher frequency than our hearing. Sure they can hear lower tones too but their like average hearing level is higher pitched.

It goes from the pentatonic scale, which lacks the beautiful semitone and also definite tonality because it also lacks the tritone. Then comes a beautiful hexatonic scale with much more direction that comes with the semitone, but it's far more beautiful to mindlessly mess with these notes because it too lacks the tritone. Then you have the diatonic scale, but not ionian, rather lydian, which is much better for fixed-tonality music, sounds more final and all.

For example, if it had been the primary tuning system in China for 400 years, that would have a different implication about the similarities between Western musical practice and Chinese than it would if it were developed 400 years ago but not found relevant enough to Chinese musical practice (prior to the entrance of Western music into China) to catch on."

musictheory,3djf95,DRL47,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:14 2015 UTC,It must be a phenomenon of the desire to tune an instrument once to play in all keys on it. That's why we're using equal temperament and accept that its intervals aren't pure. In eastern cultures music isn't supposed to sound pure and clear. Gamelan music is a perfect example for that. I think therefore this kind of music doesn't need or want the equal temperament. I can't say which one they're using though.

Nothing to do with Pythagoras or 12 tone.  What about a 24 tone system, is it not a 12 tone system with more iterations on the math?"
musictheory,3djf95,Mr-Yellow,7,Thu Jul 16 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"is it not a 12 tone system with more iterations on the math?   I have no idea what an ""iteration on the math"" could possibly be.  I like the concept, though!  Actually, there's no way to get a 24-tone system with more ""iterations on the math"", at least if I'm guessing correctly at its meaning.  Each ""iteration on the math"" adds either 5 or 7 new tones, if any.  A chromatic scale has two kinds of steps, a whole step and a half step.  The half step is the step between E and F, or B and C, and it's called a diatonic half step.  C - C# - D consists of a chromatic half step from C to C# and a diatonic half step from C# to D.  So, in all, there are 5 chromatic half steps and 7 diatonic half steps in an octave.  If a chromatic half step is c scale steps and the diatonic half step is d scale steps, the total number of scale steps is 5c + 7d.  So, for example, if the chromatic and diatonic steps are both 1 step of the scale, then we have 12 tones.  That's the system we generally use.  If the chromatic step is 1 scale step and the diatonic step is 2, then we have 19 tones.  In this case, you'd have C C# Db D D# Eb E E#/Fb F F# Gb G G# Ab A A# Bb B B#/Cb C.  On the other hand, if the chromatic step is 2 and the diatonic step is 1, you have 17 tones: C Db C# D Eb D# E F Gb F# G Ab G# A Bb A# B C.  All of these are on the circle of fifths, and the idea is that after n fifths you get back to the start.  So, in our 12-tone scale, C plus 12 fifths is B#, which we decide is enharmonic to C.  On the other hand, in the 19-tone scale, C plus 19 fifths is Bx, which we decide is enharmonic to C, not B#.  In the 17-tone scale, C plus 17 fifths is Ax, which we decide is enharmonic to C.  So what happens to 24-tone?  Isn't that just c = 2, d = 2?  Actually, no, because if you set C plus 24 fifths to C, you only get 12 different notes.  c and d have to be relatively prime.  Bummer, huh?  As a result, no number of fifths can get you a quarter step.  It's impossible.  12 fifths gets you back where you started.  Interestingly, with the 47-tone scale, you can do it in two different ways.  You can have c = 8, d = 1 or c = 1, d = 6.  The symbols get really unwieldy as we go there, but they both have Bxxx (that's 6 sharps) enharmonic to C.  They just have different fifths!  The fifth is 3c + 4d, so in the first case it's 25 scale steps and in the second it's 27.  Anything else just won't work."

musictheory,3djf95,Mr-Yellow,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"They did cycle the system to to get quartones, semitones, whole tones, m3's, and M3's. But the idea was more about how to generate specific intervals between the tonic and the P4. Knowing just those ratios, they would be able to generate tetrachords, etc.  Consider a typical 4 string lyre (numbers of strings did vary, I believe up to 13). The highest and lowest strings were  tuned to a P4. The inner two strings were tuned according to the kind of tetrachord they wanted to make:  Enharmonic tetrachords contained two quarter tones and a M3. Chromatic tetrachords contained two semitones and a minor third (think A harmonic minor: E F G# A). Diatonic tetrachords contained one semitone and two whole tones. The diatonic tetrachord is what we base the major scale and its modes on.  The pentachord was a variation of the tetrachord with a whole tone at one or the other end, especially of the diatonic tetrachord. When a pentachord and tetrachord share a note at opposite ends, they would add to a heptachord.   There is also the hexachord that added the 5th above the tonic and another 5th above either of the two inner strings."

The spots an artist chooses not to paint are important. The places a musician chooses to be silent are important.  Music is not just sound and people don't consciously realize this, it is tension from sound to create emotion and resolution to silence. A song ends in silence, it does not indefinitely sound. From silence music is born, and to silence the music will die.  In the midst of a song we know there is sound, we know there is melody, we know there is tempo, and rhythm, and we know there is tension (a term I use to describe all emotions in song), but we fail to appreciate the medium onto which we craft the art of music, we fail to appreciate the ultimate resolve of a piece, and that is silence.  edit: In case you are going to teach some beginner music theory and need a lecture, lecture about what you care about. For me I am passionate about discussing what music is first and foremost. Maybe ask your students there opinion and then share yours.

In answer to the original question, try as hard as you can to make sure your students want to learn! If they already want to learn, skip this paragraph. ImNotEven is right about the ""abstract"", I find it's more meaningful and understandable. Also, as soon as you can, try and smash the illusion of musical professionalism being the only option. The study of music in the modern age is something of a cult. Everyone thinks you have to try really hard to do things, and that only the professionals are allowed to have opinions and to use artistic license, but I've found music is far more fun when you're experimenting with sounds shamelessly. I experimented with running an improvisation ensemble at my highschool this past year, it was a ton of fun for everyone involved I'm glad to say, and my goal was to basically get people making music they enjoy and ultimately to start asking good questions and getting themselves good answers, essentially, to get them to learn about the theory that you don't get from a textbook, the most important theory of it all.  setecordas makes another interesting point about active listening. You really can't teach music without the stuff itself, and again, it makes the class far more enjoyable. That and again, ImNotEven's point about the ""abstract"", like, I can't even explain how much more important those things are than all of rhythm and notes and stuff. Basically, if you're expected to teach how to read fully-notated music without liberty, your job will be as hard as that of any school-teacher, I'd recommend solfege, it worked miracles for me. If you can, teach them stuff that they can hear in real music and use in real music creation, contour, texture, timbre, dynamics, density, rhythm, I don't know, stuff like that. Just give them that and tell them to only play the black keys on the piano.  Who I am: I'm some random teenager on the internet.

musictheory,3dgwqg,peepeepuncher,12,Thu Jul 16 04:29:14 2015 UTC,"This is a very complex subject. A lot of very smart people have thought about this issue. Right now - in 2015 - professional opinion has it, that universals in music are practically nonexistent.  One of the strongest points actually is, that all human cultures developed some kind of music. So you might consider one universal quality of music that all cultures make music.  You mention the very fundamentals of music. Sure, music develops over time. Keep in mind, this isn't a cultural quality of music, nothing people have discovered and used, but merely a physical requirement regarding the nature of music. That every kind of music somehow utilizes a dynamic range of amplitude or different kind of pitches and timbres is another very basic point, but I would agree with you here. But at this point nothing has been gained from the discussion. As /u/NinetoFiveHero says: Without some sort of change you'd only have some sort of repeating signal.  There are professionals who compared the music from all different cultures in search of universals. One might consider the octave as one example: Musical systems always make use of the fact that the frequency of one tone doubled or cut in half results in the same tone with the same overtones, just ""higher"" or ""deeper"". But nearly every other distinct aspect of music is at best a quasi-universal: Most cultures make use of it, but not all."

musictheory,3dgwqg,nadaSurfing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Great post!  And the interesting thing about the octave is that it is a natural phenomenon (the overtone series).  In a sense, the use of octaves could be just as insignificant as time, or at least chalked up to a restriction imposed by nature, just how the use of time time is a restriction imposed by nature.    In that case we can call the basic element ""sound.""  Any sound requires time, and use of the overtones for tone and timbre.  But we are back to nothing being gained from this discussion.  I personally think its so subjective that art is best analyzed in its own context, which then validates or invalidates a particular manipulation of one of these things.  For example, a tonal system that divides an octave into 5 equal parts is going to sound just as out of place in the context of our 12 tone system as it would the other way around."
musictheory,3dgwqg,AmbiguousAnonymous,4,Thu Jul 16 17:52:04 2015 UTC,"I find this topic really interesting, how we label these different 'elements' of music.     I've had the opportunity to work briefly with Richard Gill, a renowned Australian composer and music educator. He divides these elements into 'observable phenomena' and 'abstract phenomena'. The observable being pitch, tempo, harmony, etc; things that can be measured. The abstract are, of course, more relative ideas; things we describe through non-musical words. For example, we describe timbre as being tinny or rich (an orchestration manual I once saw describe the oboe's timbre as 'reedy' lol). Or dynamics are simply louder or softer than before (ie. composers don't give a dynamic marking in terms of decibels).  In my own thinking I find that the observable phenomena have different 'levels' I would say. I believe the two most basic elements would be pitch and rhythm. From pitch you can gather melody, harmony, chordal movement, etc. From rhythm you can get tempo, meter, phrase length, etc. It's difficult to construct the same sort of tiers with the abstract phenomena; you can't say that one is gathered from another (even though timbre is technically distinguished by varied dynamic levels of different frequencies, but that's another topic for another day).     tl;dr   While most elements mentioned in this thread could be universal, the observable phenomena of pitch and rhythm should be considered the most basic building blocks of theoretical music. Abstract phenomena, however, are emotional or relative perceptions which, while common to many musical styles, are not elements of theoretical music.     Sorry if I strayed from the topic a bit. But hey, I like this kind of stuff and I've spent the time learning about it, so I figured I should get to tell someone."

I think he had some very valuable lessons to teach us about music but we also need to realize that music can't be a meaningless word, which it essentially becomes should we decide that any sound at all is music.

Kidding aside, you can use any pitch collection in any way that you want. Don't just think, ""Oh, here's a dominant chord, I have to play X scale."" Play around with them and see what you like. I recommend looking at how others use those materials. Bartók frequently used the octatonic scale (""diminished scale"" to you) as a source of harmony and melody. Check out the beginning of the finale of String Quartet No.4. (C H/W diminished scale abounds.) In Aratáskor from the 44 Violin Duos, the two melodic lines utilize solely the pitches of the minor tetrachord, but played a tritone apart so that the net result is the same octatonic scale (except for the last phrase, in which both violins are playing in E♭ minor). So he's obtaining that pitch collection by means of bitonality. He does something kind of similar in No.109 from the Mikrokosmos: at the beginning, the left hand is gets G# A D E♭, the right hand gets B C F G♭ (the same thing, transposed up a minor third), which form an octatonic scale when you put the two together. The hands swap their pitch material occasionally and are unison in a couple spots, but he sticks with that single octatonic scale throughout the piece.  Here is some stuff that some internet dude made regarding the same pitch collection."
musictheory,3dgq6w,Xenoceratops,2,Thu Jul 16 07:18:49 2015 UTC,I think they sound cool over any triad:  C-Db-Eb-E-F#-G over C major or C minor.  Add the minor seventh and you can extend to the full scale:   C-Db-Eb-E-F#-G-A-Bb over C7 or Cm7.  It also fits very naturally into a diminished seventh chord:  C-Db-Eb-E-F#-G-A over Cdim7  And more.
musictheory,3dgq6w,Cdesese,0,Thu Jul 16 08:44:22 2015 UTC,It depends on the function of the triad. If you had I V vi IV would you play the C altered scale on top of the first chord just because the notes of the triad are contained in it ? I know I wouldn't.

A triad is a collection of three notes, specifically the root, 3rd, and fifth.  Guitar specific terminology: A bass is always the lowest note and is never the highest note or any other note. A bass note is also only considered a bass note if it is on either of the 6th, 5th, or 4th strings of the guitar.  The 5th is not called the harmonic. Harmonics are not any individual members of a chord, but are integer multiples of the fundamental note. A Perfect 5th is not a harmonic. It is a scaling factor of 1.5 of the root frequency. , In the case of 12 Tet, is a scaling factor whose value is the 12th root of 2 to the 7th power = 1.498, decidedly not a harmonic.

It seems like you are always looking for novel ways of generating musical syntax, often by non-obvious mappings of syntactical features of spoken language onto musical parameters. So would you personally see yourself as closer to Schubert or to Stravinsky (or at least, the Stravinsky of this quote)?  I do find it often so strange that Schoenberg and Webern are often seen as being so tied to the ""syntax without semantics"" side of things. Schoenberg and Webern were both fairly romantic in their outlook.  Especially during the free atonal period, music was often tied to intensely expressive instants rather than to a well-grounded syntax. The grounding of their music in the twelve tone technique came on as a means, I think, of giving themselves back some sense of syntax that they felt they had lost, hence allowing them to create large scale form. So I don't really think that placing Webern on the ""syntax"" side of the equation is that fair to his own aesthetic outlook."

It's a saxhorn like euphonium or tuba.   For those unfamiliar with brass bands, it's really interesting in that almost every instrument in the band reads treble clef parts in either Bb or Eb. This is so that players can switch instruments in a pinch: These bands formed mostly as community bands and it would not be uncommon for players to switch instruments to help out for a concert. A Bb euphonium player could move down to Eb tuba and as long as the instrument is pitched correctly, they could play it with the same fingerings as if they were reading a Bb part.  Oddly, the only instrument in a British brass band that doesn't read treble clef is the bass trombone, which reads it's normal non-transposing bass clef.  Today, the British Brass Band movement is a competition-based community, which produces some of the finest brass players in the world, and the top bands could be comparable to the top orchestras in the world, especially in areas like accuracy, intonation, and ensemble. The common instrumentation is: 1 Eb soprano cornet, 10-ish Bb Cornets, 3 Eb Tenor horns, 2 Bb Baritones, 2 Bb Euphoniums, 2 Trombones (reading Bb Treble Clef), 1 Bass Trombone (reading C Bass Clef), 2 Eb Bass Tubas, 2 BBb Contrabass Tubas, and a full percussion section."

In this example, pretend you changed the B major chord to B7, then used a tritone substitution to make it F7.  Now instead of having F# half-dim leading to that, you've decided you want a ii chord that functions in the same key as that F7, so now you change the ii chord to C half-dim.  And then to top it off you decide to change the F7 back to B7 and then back to just B while still keeping the C half-dim as is.

You can also think of it as an altered II7 chord. The tritone sub of a D7 chord is Ab7, Ab-C-Eb-Gb The German Aug6 chord in the key of C is F#-Ab-C-Eb. The Ab is almost always in the bass, so the interval between Ab and F# is an augmented sixth, hence ""augmented sixth chord"" When arranged as Ab-C-Eb-F#, it is easy to see how this chord is a slightly enharmonically respelled Ab7 chord: just respell F# as Gb. So since Ab7 is the tritone sub of V7/V in the key of C, and since it is enharmonically equivalent to the German Aug6 chord in the key of C, then the German Aug6 can also be seen as a tritone sub V7/V."

The defining feature of any Aug6 chord is of course the presence of an Aug6 resolving to an octave; the presence of a scale degree 1 in it seems to me entirely incidental. I would say, however, that the two common tones with V, D# and F#, perhaps weaken the progression slightly."
musictheory,3df30h,todge4,2,Wed Jul 15 19:44:10 2015 UTC,"Depends. If any note is flat in the key, as indicate by the key signature, then you use the natural sign to raise the tone. Otherwise you use sharp. If the tone is already sharp, then you use the double sharp sign. Just remember that the accidental cancels after the measure."
musictheory,3df30h,setecordas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"So in G major where F's are sharpened, if the piece has an F note somewhere with a sharp next to it, does it remain an F# or is it an F##?"
musictheory,3df30h,setecordas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"Assuming the key signature is G Major, you won't have to add a sharp beside the F because that will be indicated in the key signature. If for some reason, you need and F natural, then it will be indicated at the note with a natural sign (which flattens the F#)."
musictheory,3df30h,BdaMann,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"It would be an F#.   But that would only happen if there had been an F natural the earlier in that measure, or sometimes if there had been an F natural in the measure before."
musictheory,3df30h,saxguy2001,2,Wed Jul 15 22:59:17 2015 UTC,"Common practice is to use the key signature of the natural minor scale, and then write in accidentals as needed for harmonic or melodic minor.  For the C minor example, the accidental would be a natural sign since raising Ab and Bb a whole step makes them A-natural and B-natural."
musictheory,3df30h,saxguy2001,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:27:52 2015 UTC,Let's say a piece had the Cmin key signature and then next to an A note was a # symbol.  what would you interpret the note as?
musictheory,3df30h,DuckTux,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:40 2015 UTC,A#.  A# is A# no matter the key signature.
musictheory,3ddh5c,Ballongo,12,Wed Jul 15 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"If you are using just intonation, then they are not the same frequency. This is because the major third between F-A in the subdominant would not create the pure 5th between D-A in the supertonic."
musictheory,3ddh5c,Benjabenja,5,Wed Jul 15 12:35:43 2015 UTC,"In equal temperament they are the same not, but in just intonation and meantone temperament they aren't. There are no enharmonic notes either, Ab is not G#."
musictheory,3ddh5c,golfball1111,4,Wed Jul 15 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"Actually, funny story. Enharmonic notes originally referred to quarter tone intervals of the Pythagorean tuning system. Because of the way in which m2 intervals could differ by a small amount through P5 cycling, you would be able to build scales with enharmonic tones, that today we represent with accidentals.   Enharmonic tones were the basis of the enharmonic tetrachord genus which you can hear the Kronos Quarter playing (starting at about 1:40).   http://youtu.be/i14DoSfpfHU  The two other tetrachords were the diatonic tetrachord from which we derive our current tonal system, and the chromatic tetrachord.   NB: tetrachords are a P4 interval divided by two variable intervals. A B C D would be a typical diatonic tetrachord, whereas A Bb B D would be a typical chromatic tetrachord, and A A# Bb D would be a typical enharmonic tetrachord where the A# is a quarter tone between A and Bb."

Anyone who is familiar with jazz standards from the 1930s-50s knows how ""complex"" chord progressions in ""pop"" songs were long before rock 'n roll ever happened. Good voice leading allows for all sorts of combinations to ""work"" and sound OK. I think there's a harmonic reason why so many of us love improvising over Beatles tunes (and to a similar extent, Nirvana and Radiohead)  The (studio) production techniques of that album are pretty awesome though. Listening to ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" for the first time, mmm  also there are plenty of examples using bVII-I progressions in the rock genre"
musictheory,3ddh5c,frajen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:08:26 2015 UTC,"This is actually bullshit.  A is A.  Same note.  Now, if you're playing a variable-pitch instrument like not the piano, you can vary the inflection according to the stuff around it, and yeah, you'd vary that A differently depending on whether it's a third or a fifth to make the chord sound more in tune.  But if you do that, you're making other things out of tune.  This kind of thing is strictly reserved for variable-pitch musicians as a performance practice; in most modern contexts there's no good reason to do this kind of pitch variation, but sometimes, I guess, people do.  Now, there's something called Just Intonation (JI), where pitch ratios are small whole numbers.  In a way, it's the most ""perfect"" system of tuning chords.  (It's a shitty way to tune many other things, which is why we've moved beyond it, but it does make chords sound more pure, if you like that kind of thing, which I do.)  If you use just intonation, which has been somewhat out of vogue these last 400 years or so, that sets up a system.  In that system, if you go up by an octave, you multiply your frequency by 2.  The equal temperament system we use today has this same feature; that's not controversial.  Now, if you go up by an octave and a fifth, you're multiplying by exactly 3.  Two octaves, exactly 4.  Two octaves and a major third, exactly 5.  Dividing by 2 goes down an octave, so a perfect fifth is 3/2 and a major third is 5/4.  The thing is, these ratios are not exactly what we have today in equal temperament.  In fact, 3/2 is about 2 cents higher than an equal-tempered perfect fifth and 5/4 is about 14 cents lower than an equal-tempered major third.  Now, we can combine these two intervals (and the octave) in many different ways.  For example, let's say we go up three perfect fifths and down an octave.  That's a ratio of 27/16.  From C, up three fifths, that's A.  Now, let's say we go down a fifth and up a major third and an octave.  That's a ratio of 5/3.  From C, down a fifth is F, up a third, that's A.  So wait.  We have an A that's 27/16 and another A that's 5/3.  Which is the right one?  Well.  They're both right.  The 27/16 A is about 6 cents sharper than the equal-tempered A, while the 5/3 A is about 16 cents flatter, for a difference of about 22 cents.  (Remember, the fifth goes up about 2 cents from equal temperament and the third goes down about 14 cents.)  So if you're using JI, you have two different A's to worry about.  This is actually very problematic, and it's a good reason not to use JI.  For one, you're fuxx0red on a ii chord.  ii and IV are related chords that share two notes, right?  NOT ANYMORE -- not in a ii - V - I!  That's because the 2 in the V is incompatible with the 4 in the IV, so the 4 and the 6 in the ii have to match the 2, and it's not the right 4.  It's a total mess.  And that's basically why we have equal temperament and don't use JI.  JI sounds cool.  When people started using equal temperament, purists complained because they lost the purity of JI.  But the versatility of equal temperament is just too much.  So, if someone tells you that the supertonic's A and the subdominant's A are different notes, well, nope.  Not in a diatonic system.  In JI, maybe, but not in any system based on the Circle of Fifths.  You can create a system where they're different notes, and if that's what you're into, good luck!  Microtonal music is cool.  But conventionally, they're the same note."

musictheory,3d9q6r,thewaterballoonist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"The rules are vague and the author put in too many fancy exceptions.   The game is built around harmony cards, which are chords that you string together continuously to the left and right to make a progression. You complete a hand and collect points by playing the correct cards at the end of the progression and slapping on a cadence card to show that you are finished with the progression. Additional points can be earned by playing special harmony cards (which are things like first-inversion chains, ct°7 chords, and expansion of a chord) as well as voice leading cards, which are played as soprano and bass notes that are predetermined by the card. As an example, on vi, you can play ""Do"" in the soprano and ""La"" in the bass. All this sounds well and good, but like I said, the rules aren't laid out very well. This is a legal progression that I played in a game to show how ridiculous the voice leading cards can get. I'll get to that in a moment. The progression itself is not as bad as some of the ones that I've come up with, but it's still fucking awful. It+6 resolving to vii°6? Somebody forgot to mention that augmented sixth chords resolve in a certain way when they were writing the rules, it seems. It's allowed though, because It+6 precedes a dominant function (represented by ""D"" on the cards) according to the rules, and vii°6 is regarded as a dominant function. Now, when you start stringing wonky harmony cards together and playing the voice leading cards, the melody starts looking (and sounding) wacky. Isn't the point of the game to teach something about harmony and voice leading? Why does the soprano melody on the It+6 I6/4 V progression have to be Fi Mi Ti? That's awful voice leading.  Also, the chordal expansion card on the last chord makes me lawl. As does the ""Bach"" style card that accompanies this monstrosity.  Here is a progression that my friend started. There are some errors in it, but I'd like to call your attention to the iii6 card. Dominant function? Are you kidding me? It's hilarious that the iii [6/3 chain] iii6 sequence is legal."

If you are just searching for notes from harmonic minor or melodic minor it will also not work.  For example most minor music uses the flat seventh in most places, and the raised 7th over a V chord. Searching for only one of them will make the vast majority of minor music not work with your system."

musictheory,3d9e63,disaster_face,2,Tue Jul 14 19:55:41 2015 UTC,"This is simply not true.  In tonal music a minor key includes both 6ths and 7ths.  You can consider them chromatic alterations if you wish, but as they are present nearly 100% of the time over certain chords, it's irrelevant.  They are part of the key.  From wikipedia on minor keys:   ""The minor mode, with its variable sixth and seventh degrees, offers nine notes, in C: C-D-E♭-F-G-A♭-A♮-B♭-B♮, over the major mode's seven, in C: C-D-E-F-G-A-B.""   In common practice, the v chord becomes a V chord pretty much all the time.  To say the raised 6th and 7th aren't part of a minor key is to say that there is virtually no classical music that is in a minor key."
musictheory,3d9e63,setecordas,-1,Tue Jul 14 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"I understand all of that, and your advice is both good and important for the functionality of his program, but it is a question of nomenclature.   For instance, the Wikipedia article you reference explicitly states modes, not keys.   When you write a key on your staff, you wouldn't indicate the accidentals based on the possible alterations of the scale. If you are asked what the key of C minor is, you would Say ""Bb, Eb, Ab"", not ""Bb, Bnat, Eb, Ab, Anat."

There is more to a key than its signature.  G major and E minor share the same signature.  They are not the same key.  The way key signatures are formed only allows for one of each diatonic step.  In the case of minor keys, it's an approximation.  That's why virtually all minor pieces composed in the common practice period have accidentals.   you wouldn't indicate the accidentals based on the possible alterations of the scale   In classical music virtually every piece has a chord based on the dominant.  In minor keys this chords is almost always ""altered"".  This is not a possible alteration like a iv chord in a major key.  This is standard practice.  In fact, the V to i progression is the main relationship in minor music.  Music that doesn't include these ""alterations"" can be considered modal and isn't in the strict definition of the word, tonal.    If you are asked what the key of C minor is, you would Say ""Bb, Eb, Ab"", not ""Bb, Bnat, Eb, Ab, Anat.   If I was asked what the key of C minor is I wouldn't read off a collection of notes, but if I was asked what notes are diatonic to the key I would absolutely mention both 6ths and 7ths as do virtually all traditional harmony texts.

G major and E minor share the same signature. They are not the same key.  The way key signatures are formed only allows for one of each diatonic step. In the case of minor keys, it's an approximation. That's why virtually all minor pieces composed in the common practice period have accidentals.   They share the same key signature because common practice tonal music considers major and minor modes as being fundamentally important to the music. E minor is a mode of G major so the distinction is made.   That's why we don't call the key of D Dorian by the same name, but call it C major. Calling Harmonic and Melodic minor scales diatonic is a very recent thing and still controversial. The harmonic minor is not a diatonic scale because of the m3 interval. The Melodic minor scale, on the other hand, doesn't follow a diatesseron + diapente construction. The melodic minor is also out as a diatonic scale. So they are not diatonic. Besides, the raised 6th and 7th are comsidered borrowed from the major parallel major.   If being diatonic to a key is the important factor, then the altered tones of the melodic minor are not part of the minor key.   If overall tonal gravity is what is important to a key, the raised 6th and 7th are not necessary as a key can be determined without them. Modal music does not require dominant function chords.   If the pitch set being used is what is important to a key, then every chromaticism in a song can said to be part of the key.  However, the melodic and harmonic minors are not diatonic, are not necessary to determine where the tonal center is, and are borrowed from the major. Any number of chromaticisms could then be said to be in any key, but that is not the case.   But you can define pitch sets and classes as being important in a musical work beyond the key. The key is not that important a thing other than to provide a simple basis for analysis.  The point is not to diminish the importance of the V7 in minor, but to be consistent both historically and in practice with all keys. There is no need to special plead about melodic and minor scales."

Look, in my very first reply to you I said that you can consider the raised 6th and 7th chromatic alterations if you really want to, but that practically speaking, it makes no difference.  You continue to argue and be about as pedantic as possible about it.

(The standard ones do, anyway; some music uses nonstandard key sigs.) Key itself is a separate thing entirely from mode – major, minor, or otherwise. Key is the note that is heard as the tonic. In minor mode music, the use of variable sixth and seventh scale degrees is common and helps to establish tonality through informed harmonic and melodic technique. ""Harmonic minor"" is not a key, but neither is ""natural minor"" or ""major"" or any other modal designation.  The tool is supposed to help the user determine the key of a pitch collection. I believe that it is extremely limited in its ability to do this, if all that it does is spit out a preprogrammed ordered set to match the user's input. There is much more that goes into harmony and the way that we perceive key than what pitches are present. Input the pitch content of a tune like Drunken Sailor and the program, in its present incarnation, is going to spit back D major and B (natural) minor. Use your ear though, and it's clear that the note that the melody resolves on is E, not D or B. Okay, so we include the dorian scale in the list. Eventually, we'll have to do it for the other diatonic modes. Now, instead of two options, the user has to sort through 7, and pretty soon it becomes a sea of bullshit like auxilliary diminished blues. Instead of helping the user to narrow down their options and find the key of the music, they are now presented with several options that make an interpretation more ambiguous."

It is true that for his program to function well, it needs to take into account chromatic alterations of scales, but the key of the harmonic or melodic minor is not the same thing as all the pitches available to a scale or chord. That's why no one ever talks about the whole tone, fully diminished, or altered keys.

I've never read a book, article, or treatise, or talked to any one, who ever said that a musical key is anything other than the notes of the major or natural minor scales.   I don't doubt it. Keep in mind that Europe was on the major/minor key system for 400 years. The notion of another scale system would have baffled Rameau. Most people still have a difficult time with newer harmonic ideas. Let's not be blind followers, though. How would you describe polymodal music? Something where multiple scales are being used, but the tonic note is the same between them. There is plenty of music that goes back and forth between major and minor, sometimes at a very rapid rate the confuses the hierarchy of major and minor within the music. If C is consistently the tonic, the ""key note,"" then does it not make sense to say that the key, if you have to call it something, is C, and the mode is in a state of flux?"
musictheory,3dc5y8,aiseman,4,Wed Jul 15 03:07:56 2015 UTC,"I will answer from the ""classical"" side of things.    1)when writing chord progressions, does it have to have authentic,plagal or deceptive cadence? or any type of cadence? i get that you need to get to root (I) at some point, but do you have to go through V, IV or VII to get there?   In classical harmony, the harmonic component of a full cadence (or PAC) is almost always a root position V to a root position I. A plagal cadence is most often used to reinforce that cadence, but typically does not act on its own. A deceptive cadence is not really a cadence at all, but is rather the evasion of an expected cadence by swapping in an unexpected harmony.   So hang your hat on the full cadence, the PAC, the V to I. That's the thing you are searching for when you are marking cadences on a score. That's the thing you should be awaiting as a listener and expecting. The other things either provide support to the PAC (by coming after it as a kind of after thought that helps dissipate the energy) or throws a wrench into things and thwarts that expectation of closure.    2)Also, can you start with not the first chord but any other? like II-V-I   Yes. This often happens. We sometimes call these ""auxiliary cadences,"" referring to situations where you are missing the initial tonic.    i was reading musictheory.net and example they have is called circle where the progression ends in V-I every time, so is that the only way to make them?   That is the only way to construct a perfect authentic cadence, yes. In the classical style, it's useful to think of everything as being sort of this big wind up, a building of energy, with the cadence being the point at which the energy is released. So everything in a classical phrase is preparing us to get that V I as part of a PAC.   Of course, if your goal isn't to understand, play, or write classical music, the definition of a cadence becomes a trickier issue. Think of the V - I as being a stylistic thing. Sort of like saying ""goodbye"" in English. If you want to speak another language, then you can't end your conversation with ""goodbye"" anymore, you have to use the equivalent words in whatever language you are speaking. Similarly, different musical languages have different harmonic ""words"" that are associated with the sound of cadences in that style. So get to know whatever style it is you want to get to know. Figure out where you feel you are hearing cadences happen (moments where things seem to come to an end, even if only temporarily), and then look into what harmonies they're using to get that sense of articulation. That's one way to take the classical idea of the cadence and use it to help you figure out how other kinds of music works."

musictheory,3dc5y8,Xenoceratops,3,Wed Jul 15 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"1)when writing chord progressions, does it have to have authentic,plagal or deceptive cadence? or any type of cadence? i get that you need to get to root (I) at some point, but do you have to go through V, IV or VII to get there?   For now, yes. The idea here is that there are three basic functional groups: the Tonic group, the Subdominant group, and the Dominant group.  T = I, vi, sometimes iii.  S = IV, ii, sometimes vi.  D = V, vii°, sometimes iii.   The TSDT cycle is an important part of understanding chord progressions. Other nonstandard chords are often thought of as substituting for those functions in some way or another. One such example is the tritone substitution, which is represented as ♭II7. This is actually a dominant function. The last cadence in this piece uses a tritone substitution (♭II7 I):  Johannes Brahms - Sarabande No.2  There are other progressions which are not stressed in traditional harmony but crop up occasionally. The last few chords in this song are A7 F A7 F A7 F A F, which is a chromatic mediant relationship :  Sergei Rachmaninov - Utro  You can read about that sort of thing in Neo-Riemannian Theory.   2)Also, can you start with not the first chord but any other? like II-V-I   You can start with any chord you like. Tonality is established by the chord progression and cadence and has nothing to do with which chord starts the progression.   i was reading musictheory.net and example they have is called circle where the progression ends in V-I every time, so is that the only way to make them?   The diatonic cycle of fifths. It's a good place to start. Progressions by descending fifth (IV vii° iii vi ii V I) are the principle way in which chord progressions are made in Western tonal music. Progressions by descending thirds are also common. Here is a cycle of thirds:  I vi IV ii vii° V iii I  iii is a weird chord, and V is such a strong chord, so we omit iii. Here is the progression now:  I vi IV ii vii° V I  Now check out what happens if we group the chords by 2's.  [I vi] [IV ii] [vii° V] I  Remember the Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant functions? When you do this, each pair represents  its own functional group.  [I vi] = T  [IV ii] = S  [vii° V] = D  I = T"

musictheory,3dbpdv,SeeBread,6,Wed Jul 15 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"I think it might be an Ahalfdim7 chord, followed by a D7 chord.  I'm no expert on this style of music, but I can say that this can be related to a very general technique that you find also in classical music. A music theorist named Janet Schmalfeldt has called it the ""one more time technique."" Basically, at the point where a cadence is expected, the harmonic progression backs away from a full resolution it a root position tonic. The typical classical scenario is when a cadential dominant chord moves to a V42 chord (seventh in the bass), which then resolves to I6. The move to an inverted dominant (and the most unstable inversion at that) and then inverted tonic weakens the cadence considerably. It's obviously closely related to the deceptive cadence, another form of undercutting an expected cadential resolution. But the special thing about suddenly going V42-I6 when a cadence is expected is that it not only undercuts the cadence but serves to ""back up"" the cadential progression and restart the process of cadencing--whence ""one more time"" technique. Many classical cadences begin on a I6 chord (I6-ii6-V64-V7-I, I6-IV-V7-I, etc.), so the I6 chord almost always ends up functioning as the beginning of a new cadential progression. In the Family Guy example, we have V7 going to iii7--not quite the same progression, but notice how iii7 is built on the same bass note as I6, and similarly also represents a ""backing-up"" in the harmonic progression (further back on the circle of fifths: iii-vi-ii-V-I). Another important thing about the one-more-time technique is that a cadential effect in the melody is also avoided, and instead backs up to an earlier point. Say the melody was descending 5-4-3-2...the cadence would continue to 1, but instead 2 (harmonized by V42) leaps back up to 5 (harmonized by I6), and then another descent begins (5-4-3-2...). Again we have a similar thing in the Family Guy example: 7 in the melody, the leading tone, harmonized by V7, falls to 5, harmonized by iii7.  If you want to read more about this, you could look at Schmalfeldt's essay, “Cadential Processes: The Evaded Cadence and the ‘One More Time’ Technique.” Journal of Musicological Research Volume 12 (1992), pages 1–52."

Aø7(plus b9, if you want to think of the top of the saxophone lick as part of the harmony) --> D7.  And then, right back to V of FM on ""He's a..."" and so on. Funny enough, we're 2/3 in the notes of the resolution on the first ""guy"": A and C are both in that first chord, just not...the root of the chord we're expecting.  I don't have any examples off the top of my head, but this does strike me as a common gesture in musical theater to heighten the intensity of a song's ending: hold off the big moment for juuuuust a bit past what everyone in the audience is expecting (especially for such a ubiquitous song).

musictheory,3dd7sm,hittingal,6,Wed Jul 15 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"Well, assuming the progression loops back around on itself, you could say that there's a plagal cadence, IV-I. But what I'd really say is that the sheer ubiquity of this pattern has conditioned us to hear it as a self-contained structure.  EDIT: I might add also that I think phrase rhythm is extremely important, maybe even more important than harmony, in determining what we hear as ""resolved."" This four-chord progression is usually distributed across a four-bar phrase, the integrity of which is almost always reinforced by the grouping structure of the melody and the prosody of the lyrics. All of these mutually-reinforcing parameters help us to hear the four-bar phrase as something self-contained. By association, we hear this progression as being self-contained. It's a bit circular--the progression sounds self-contained because we hear it in contexts where it is made to sound self-contained--but that's just kinda how things work."

And vi can function as a subdominant chord and create plagal motion, like IV, when it moves directly to I. But I don't think I've ever heard the idea that IV can substitute for I, and that a progression like vi-IV can substitute for IV-I. It's difficult for me to see how vi-IV is in any way analogous to IV-I. Is there precedent for this?  I also don't think the last two chords of this progression tend to be heard as forming a cadence at all, but rather a cadence (if there is any) comes when the progression loops around, creating a pretty straightforward plagal cadence IV-I, and no need for spurious substitutions. What do we get by insisting that vi-IV is a cadence at all?"

He associates a motive with anakin's mother. It plays almost every time she is in frame. In the revenge of the sith, he puts the motive right after anakin chokes padme. This is significant because the failure to save his mother is what lead anakin to the dark path to try to save padme and eventually end in him killing her. Williams notices this even though it is not stated in that scene and uses the motive to remind the viewer/listener of the cruel irony. Its not just a ""look this thing is here and this is the music for it,"" it's several layers deeper and if it were a yellow pen or something in the background, it would be an incredible visual rhetorical device.

More than anything, it's the timbres. Synthesizers were huge in the 80s because the technology was pretty new. In 1983 the Yamaha DX7 became the first FM digital synth that was affordable—earlier digital synths were prohibitively expensive, and other cheap synths were analog and not digital. imo moving from analog to digital totally changes the soundscape of an 80s pop tune. Sampling was another kind of synthesis that was brand new at that time; the Fairlight CMI was a digital sampling-based synth that was very expensive, but most good recording studios had one available to the groups recording there. The Roland TR-808 was also an immensely popular drum machine that allowed bands to form without a drummer. Also important was the sequencer/arpeggiator, which allowed even mediocre keyboardists to really contribute complex backgrounds to the tune by just pressing one or two keys. These were all brand new technologies that were hugely popular in the 1980s.

It's an odd one though - I hear the Fb5 as a type of dominant - it's really a B half dim 7 with a missing D. Going to a G chord after confirms this further. It's more along the lines of a reverse progression, or retrogression as the dominant comes first and moves to the sub-dominant. It sounds really nice backward as well.  Anyway, it's a nice bunch of chords."

musictheory,3d8hkt,k0mbine,2,Tue Jul 14 09:31:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's 'cause this song doesn't really have chord progressions. I'd characterize most of the song as a series of long pedal tones, over which riffs are played/sung. The pedal tones are pretty much always chord roots, or, perhaps better, local tonic notes of the the riffs on top. It starts with a long F (alternating with A), then settles on C (alternating with E), so maybe you could call that a big IV-I. Based on the riffs, it's mostly C Mixolydian (i.e., with Bb instead of B). There's a long pedal on C, then a little shift to an F, which I guess you could call IV, then back to C, then a longish section on G, which you could call V, then back to C...and so on. You hear a lot of C-Bb-C cadences, harmonized I-bVII-I. Near the end of the song we get some chords, but I'm tempted to not call them progressions and just call them riffs that are harmonized with parallel triads: G-F-G-Bb, then C-Eb-Bb-C-G-Bb-Eb-Bb-C, each note harmonized as the root of a major triad. Then a final riff, centered on C minor. Then a drum solo...no harmony there."

musictheory,3d8hkt,Cdesese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:03:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure, but maybe start by improvising a riff over a pedal tone, and then move to a new pedal tone, and improvise a new riff over it. As for the relationships between the pedal tones, I guess that could be anything you want. You could start by using this song as a model, where it's basically the tonic, subdominant, and dominant notes that are used as the pedals, but then you could try others."
musictheory,3d8hkt,setecordas,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:11:23 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to think about this is as a blues scale in C.   Blues scales tend to harmonize with parallel dom7 chords on I7, IV7 and V7  Unlike traditional scales, chords in blues are not harmonizing each note on the scale, but the roots.   I haven't analyzed the song that far to see if they are doing anything else, but the above is the gist of it."
musictheory,3d773p,blueheronsmusic,4,Tue Jul 14 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"It's easiest to use vamps and repeating chord progressions to establish modal sections. So you might have a progression that bounces between Fmaj7#11 and G13 to establish F lydian.  Melodically speaking, every mode has different characteristics. You would emphasize the #11 in F lydian, but you would generally avoid the 11 in C major, unless you were using it as a 4-3 suspension. So playing F lydian, F would be a note that you'd rely on heavily to resolve, but in C major, you'd avoid it almost completely unless you were trying to build tension.  Basically, different chords and scales may have the same collection of notes, but the hierarchy of the notes might be totally different. The resolving notes in C major are C, E, and G, and the tension note is F. The resolving notes in F lydian are F, A, and C, and there are no tension notes."
musictheory,3d773p,BdaMann,3,Tue Jul 14 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"I think this answers OPs question more directly than anyone else so far. Another way of saying this is that you need to find the notes and chords that are the most representative of that mode (basically, chords including those altered notes that are specific to a certain mode such as F# in C Lydian) and use those frequently with resolution to your modal tonic to establish that particular modal ""sound"" that you are going for.   As far as examples, this YouTube video breaks it down better than any I've seen and provides clear, strong examples. I believe this video is exactly what you are looking for, OP.  http://youtu.be/IF47dr8sVyE"

musictheory,3d773p,MiskyWilkshake,2,Thu Jul 16 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"It's probably easier to see how this works if we keep the tonic pitch the same but change the mode. Let's work with C as a tonic pitch, and we'll work with C Ionian and C Lydian.  C Ionian scale: C-D-E-F-G-A-B C Lydian scale: C-D-E-F#-G-A-B  Notice how all of the notes are the same except the fourth note in each of the scales: it is F in C Ionian, and F# in C Lydian.   Now lets compare the chords in C Ionian and C Lydian and their roman numeral (RN) designations:    C Ionian RN C Lydian RN    CEG I CEG I   DFA ii DF#A II   EGB iii EGB iii   FAC IV F#AC #ivo   GBD V GBD V   ACE vi ACE vi   BDF viio BDF# VII    Notice how three of the chords in the Lydian scale are different from their Ionian counterpoints: II (instead of ii), #ivo (instead of IV), and VII (instead of viio). Notice how all of these are chords that in C Ionian contained F, and in C Lydian contain F#, which is the only note that is different between these two modes.  So, if you want to a progression to be in C Lydian instead of C Ionian, stick to these Lydian forms of these chords. The Lydian chords function more or less like their Ionian counterparts: II and #ivo lead nicely to V (in fact notice how they are exactly the same as V/V and viio/V). VII is a bit stranger, but could lead nicely to I."

musictheory,3d773p,MiguelMarquezMusic,2,Tue Jul 14 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"You can generalize the approach I've given to any mode. Imagine D minor (Aeolian), and how its chords function, and in a manner analogous to what I've shown for C Ionian and C Lydian, determine the chords for D Dorian. All chords in D Aeolian that contain a Bb will contain B instead in D Dorian. So iv, with Bb, will become IV, with B. And i-IV-i turns out to be a great way to make something sound Dorian."
musictheory,3d773p,ShamwowTseDung,0,Tue Jul 14 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard. If we want to establish a chord progression in Ionian, we'd use I IV V (V7). If we wanted the same in Dorian, then it'd be i7 IV7. If it were in Phrygian, then i bII vii. In Lydian, I IV VII"

musictheory,3d773p,Cdesese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:26:10 2015 UTC,"These are called ""relative keys"" -- same key signature (standard sharps/flats), but different resting tones, or ""tonic"". To use your example, C Major and F Lydian have the same notes, but the way the melody is constructed will make C feel like it the strongest or most ""at rest"" pitch at key points in the melody in C Major, or F in F Lydian. This is often done through the use of the dominant chord to create tension back to the resting tone.   The most common use of relative keys is between relative Major and minor, such as C Major and A minor -- both have no sharps/flats in the key signature, but they have different resting tones. In this case, they can often be distinguished because the minor mode often adds accidentals to establish the resting tone -- even though E7 doesn't occur ""naturally"" in A minor, it creates the tension that pulls your ear back to A and makes it feel good/at rest.  Your pedal tone strategy might work for some chord progressions,  but not others. Listen for which note sounds like it is central to the structure of the melody/chord progression.   I think other comments thought you were asking about parallel keys, which share a tonic but not a key signature, such as C Major and C Lydian."
musictheory,3d773p,LordJanas,2,Tue Jul 14 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"I did not think the OP was talking about parallel modes. I am suggesting that the OP think about chord functions in a mode according to the parallel Ionian (for major modes) or Aeolian (for minor modes). So if you want to know how chords function in F Lydian, think about how the corresponding chords would function in F Ionian. One could almost just write a progression in F Ionian and then replace every Bb with B, and you'd have an F Lydian progression. Likewise, to get a progression in D Dorian, imagine D Aeolian with Bs instead of Bbs."
musictheory,3d773p,doesnotgetthepoint,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:06:12 2015 UTC,It depends on what you tonicize.  D Dorian is A minor tonicizing the D.    The beauty of modes is that they are able to so easily transition between different key areas and scales.

Why don't I try to transcribe this piece 'from scratch', and start a discussion about the compositional techniques that I find interesting and broadly applicable to my own approach.  2)  My main frustration is with the Q'n'A format of most submissions.  Maybe I'm mistaken, but my impression is that most of the submitters/commenters here are students, and all the ""theory"" involved is related to answering questions that, to me, are not particularly interesting or useful.

I also think part of this has to do with the Q&A style of reddit itself. This has become a very ""askmusictheorists"" kind of reddit. But part of that is because there are other platforms to do the other relevant stuff. There's /r/letstalkmusic for discussion that doesn't really involve technical terminology, there's all the niche genre subreddits to talk about the pieces / songs you like, there's places like /r/composer for sharing your works and critiquing others, etc. So I think the focus on analysis comes primarily from the fact that there isn't really another subreddit dedicated to that.

It contains complete chord lists for every note for each scale and breaks down all chords and scales using interval diagrams and the circle of fifths as a tool for analyzing the way each chord and scale will sound.   All mode information for every note in each scale is listed along with the fretboard diagrams. It is by far the most complete and organized chord and scale encyclopedia that has ever been written. It contains new to music, negative chords, which doubles all of the existing chords. It is a reference book and a tool for writing and completing music.

musictheory,3dbd37,setecordas,3,Tue Jul 14 23:57:59 2015 UTC,So what is a negative chord?
musictheory,3dbd37,setecordas,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:05:20 2015 UTC,"Regular triads contain three notes, the root or bass, the perfect 5th,  and a third triad note that gives the chord it's name. Negative chords contain the root or bass, the suspended or perfect 4th, and the triad note, that again gives the chord it's name.   On a guitar, the harmonics are located directly above the 5th, 7th, and 12th frets. Regular chords use the perfect 5th, or the harmonic note 7 intervals away. Negative chords, use the suspended 4th or perfect 4th, or the harmonic note 5 intervals away. Basically, it's the difference between moving in a clockwise verses counterclockwise motion around the circle of fifths. Negative chords derive their names from their mirror image interval counterparts.   Chords, like scales, also have modes. If you modulate all the triads, all the negative triads are created. However, because the interval diagrams of the chords are mirror images of regular chords, it became easier and more useful to name them in a negative way since the interval diagram and circle of fifths diagram are mirror images of their regular counterpart. In other words, the negative naming nomenclature helps to describe the way a chord will sound better and more easily than using modes.  maj3 = 4 3 5  -maj3 = 5 3 4"
musictheory,3dbd37,MiguelMarquezMusic,3,Wed Jul 15 00:23:28 2015 UTC,"So is the negative chord terminology your invention or something that I could read about elsewhere? Are you calling an F major chord with a Bb instead of a C a negative chord, or are you talking about F major in 2nd inversion with the C in the bass?"
musictheory,3dbd37,LarryLarington,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"The negative chord terminology is something I had to invent. I'm talking about the 2nd inversion with C as the bass. Negative chords are often referred to as chords with alternate bass lines, such as the F maj3/C, with C being the alternate bass line. However, I discovered negative chords by mirroring the regular chords interval diagrams, not via modulation or by use of inversions.  Naming chords in a negative way was absolutely essential to simplifying the encyclopedia because it describes their negative interval relationship better than by use of inversions because their interval and circle of fifths diagrams are mirror images of their regular counterparts. When add notes are added it makes more sense to add them in a negative way than to try and use regular chord names. In other words, a maj3 (7) has a mirror counterpart -maj3 (7) that will also sound good. To name name them using inversions min3 2 (b9) = -maj3 (7).   Again, this is the difference in moving in a clockwise versus counterclockwise motion around the circle of fifths.  min 3 = 4 3 5  maj3 2 = 5 3 4  -min 3 = 5 3 4"

There are lots of those in this piece. Another one I noticed just from my casual listen was the good old flat six – flat 7 – 1 cadence.

Eb - pretty standard, certainly sounds like establish the key of Eb major.  Gm - Pretty normal stuff, except for the A natural, outside the Eb major scale. Personally I'm not a big fan of this sound in this piece.  Ab - still sounds like we're in the key of Eb major, and this is a typical IV chord.  Abmin - minor iv chord has the non-diatonic B natural (or C flat), but that's pretty common. Melody for both these Ab chords starts on the 2 of the chord, which is a nice suspended sound.  Dd - This is the ""weirdest"" chord so far. I interpret it as a borrow chord from the key of Ebmin, the parallel minor. In this case there's no B chord right before it, which is what you commonly hear especially in video game music (e.g. the Mario theme). You'll see it in pop music as well.  Then the initial part of the progression repeats, but with some more suspensions.  Eb - again  Gm7 - No pesky A natural this time.  Ab - Suspended big time this time.  Bb - First time we get to see the dominant, initially suspended with the 2 and 4 of the chord.  There's a quick transition note before the Cm. It's a G7 with a B in the bass, or maybe it's some sort of B diminished (I'm bad at diminished chord terminology)."
musictheory,3d6gir,GronkleMcFadden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"B diminished (starting with whole step) can be played over(with) a g7 chord that resolves to a c major or minor. The reason for this is the b diminished scale hits the important notes of the g7 to define it (the 3rd,5th and 7th of g7) plus almost all of the possible altered extensions of g7."

One thing you can do is think of jazz 'guide tones'. build a chord with a 4th or 5th above the melodic line (bass in this case), and then completely mess around with 1 or 2 other notes. You could get some harmonies that you would never have expected that sound fucking awesome."
musictheory,3d4vty,Akoustyk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:12:38 2015 UTC,"I know what I would do, I wrote one, and I like it a lot actually, but I'm not writing stuff for you. If you want to write something, the way to do it is not to go to a forum and ask others to write it for you, which they could only half do, becuase the rhythm is important, but still.   Not knocking you for asking, just saying.   There are 2 ways you can do this. One, is to just keep trying, one note at a time that works well with it. Or learn some theory of harmony, learn about the key etcetera.   What I did, personally, was I listened to the bassline, developed a melody I liked over it, and that helped me hear the harmony I wanted.   But I also know some theory, so that helped me be able to look at my guitar, and know quite quickly where the notes I wanted were, so it was fast.   When you don't know any theory, it's a lot of trial and error to hunt for what you want.   There is no rule, there are many ways to harmonize as you can see. Music is not a thing that has one way to do it and you learn how to do that. It is not connect the dots. It is art and creativity. YOU have to write the music, if you want to write it. The ideas come from YOU, not some method you learned. There is not an algorithm that tells people how to write music. That's why there are good writers and bad ones. If there was some recipe anyone could learn, we'd all be great songwriters."

I do actually study music theory so I do know how it is (or should be) working. The main issue was it was about 1 in the morning and I was about to go to bed so my theory mind was working to its full capabilities.  Also, you know when you figure something out and, while it may not sound right, you've been working on it for so long that you can't shift your mind from what you've already got. I just wanted to see how some other people would go about harmonising it.   TBH I don't think I'll end up using it at all, I just think it's good (for myself and others) to get a number of different perspectives on what one can write."

If you have questions about how to apply theory (Why doesn't this melody resolve using a IV/V in B).- that makes more sense than ""Here is the melody, what should be the harmony"".  The way I hear things, the melody implies the harmony.  If I can't hear the harmony, there is usually something not right with the melody.

musictheory,3d4nbg,shiner_man,7,Mon Jul 13 19:40:45 2015 UTC,"If the progression is in G, it would actually be notated as I-iii-VII-IV. Capital Roman numerals are used for major chords, and lowercase are for minor.   You're basically playing a progression that isn't diatonic to your key.

musictheory,3d41ir,Cdesese,2,Mon Jul 13 19:54:22 2015 UTC,"IV65 would usually mean a IV7 chord in first inversion, which would have a bass note different from this example (B instead of G). The root of this chord is E, not the bass G, which means its a ii chord, and specifically a ii65 chord, a ii7 chord in first inversion."
musictheory,3d41ir,xiipaoc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Am I missing something, or is it a IV65?   Sure looks that way, doesn't it?  But that's not how Roman numeral notation works.  You're right that 65 are the notes above the bass.  In this case, 65 (the 6 is on top of the 5) is actually short for 653 (again, arranged vertically).  This comes from figured bass.  You'd see that G with 65 written on top of it, and you'd play those notes and the assumed 3.  However, the Roman numeral goes with the function of the chord, while the figured bass, naturally, comes from the bass.  So there's a mix of notations.  The ii65 chord is a ii chord, that's for sure, but the ii chord written with a 65(3) above the bass is the first inversion 7th chord, whose bass is the 4 of the scale, not the 2.  So, to sum it up, the way you'd write this chord in figured bass would be to write the 4 of the scale then write 653 above it (or just 65, commonly, with the 3 implied).  The way you analyze it using Roman numerals is as a ii chord, and specifically, it's in the inversion that is written with 65.  The inversions of the 7th chord are ii7(53), ii65(3), ii(6)43, and ii(6)42, with the numbers in parentheses being generally omitted.  The inversions of a simple triad are ii(53), ii6(3), and ii64.  If you're doing Roman numeral analysis, you'll want to know all of these."

That E your talking about is played over a IV chord, but it's not so much that the E is out of place...if anything, the IV is out of place. It's not actually out of place, but Bach did this to add some flavor. He could have written a half note V chord or a viidim to a V, but instead he did the IV which was unexpected.

musictheory,3d3365,GronkleMcFadden,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are singing everything. always. Singing is the most effective way of internalizing intervals. Sing the interval ascending, descending, and harmonically (youll need someone else or urself playing an instrument to sing harmonically). Also vary how you sing the intervals. For example, when drilling the interval from c up to e sing. ""Major 3rd"" sing ""major"" on the C and ""3rd"" on the e. Then do it descending reversed. ""Major"" on the e and ""3rd"" on the c. Then, sing the note names respectively ""c, e"" ""e, c"". Then, sing ascending and descending the notes with random syllables like ""lah, lah."" Or ""oo, oo""...lastly, listen to intervals in different registers and on different instruments. The reason for all of this being that timbre drastically effects how we hear pitches, and most of us hear better on our main instrument. If you are a pianist you will hear intervals clearer on a piano than a guitar. This is the point of singing them a bunch of different ways too. the more ways you hear these intervals the better and faster ur recollection will be. Also, always be looking at the intervals written on the staff. Any time as a human being that you can connect sensory input with a visualization is beneficial as humans strongest sense is vision. One more thing. Find as many lists of well known songs or jingles that have intervals analyzed. You can find many such lists out there. Like for memorizing perfect fourth you can think of the ""here comes the bride"" part of the wedding song we all know. Or for a major 6th you can think of the first 2 notes of the 3 note NBC melody. Or if your thinking of octaves u can think of ""some where..."" Part of ""somewhere over the rainbow"" There are countless nursery rhymes and jingles you already know how to sing and hear that you can use to your advantage when memorizing intervals."

It gives it a nice ""new"" feel if you're playing a chord melody solo and you want to switch it up the second time through"
musictheory,3d249b,dugefrsh34,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:31:35 2015 UTC,I'm guessing after alot of practice you're able to tie subsequent chord substitution's together to make some nice sounds? Any other tips on how to go about it aside form just practicing?
musictheory,3d249b,frajen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:12:15 2015 UTC,"nice sounds   Harmony, especially reharmonized harmony, will rely on proper voice leading.  I think playing a lot of bebop helps with the mechanics of changing keys, since you get used to dealing with multiple consecutive ii-V's. All the Things You Are, Stella by Starlight, Parker blues/Confirmation...  Another thing, as a pianist I think listening to Thelonious Monk solo (e.g. ""Round Midnight"", Ask Me Now"") is really good for escaping traditional Western notions of what harmonies or harmonic sequences sound ""OK"" with otherwise erratic melodies   Any other tips on how to go about it aside form just practicing   The video you linked definitely gets it right, just take simple melodies at first and reharmonize them. Or take a song you like and change up a certain section.  If you're willing to shred a melody a little bit, you can always reharmonize major with minor chords and vice versa"
musictheory,3d249b,dugefrsh34,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a total visual thing for me when playing. If I know what the melody note is, I can just ""see"" the chords that can be created around it to play that G melody note, and can just use what ever chord I can quickly recall that contains my finger on the G note. I'm not necessarily thinking about the chord structure per se, but just which chords ""land"" on that note. I'll try and make a video and post it for you on my lunch break. Give me an hour or so, as I think it'll be super helpful to actually see and hear what I mean, rather than what I'm trying to explain haha it's a lot simpler than you may think if you know your chords"

I just slapped this together really quick, but if it's not what you're looking for or helpful, feel free to let me know and I can try and do one a little bit more in depth.   I used a lot of drop voicing's for chords to make them land on my melody notes, so that's another thing you can think of when trying to reharm.

musictheory,3d249b,tippocalypse,5,Mon Jul 13 04:25:48 2015 UTC,"chord job   In functional harmony, there are several jobs a chord can do, mainly involving returning to the home chord.

(replacing F with Dm in the key of C Major, for example).  If you do it by note, you find a chord with the current note in it and use that, as u/dugefrsh34 explains.  *missed an article"

Also, that's a shitload of books, and you don't want to fall into the ""buy more books = be more talented"" trap.   That said, I only know a few of these books personally, and I will say that Mark Levine's Jazz Theory book is a great intro text that goes really deep. His Jazz Piano book, on the other hand, is NOT for beginners. It starts with some pretty heavy 13th chord stuff that will quickly dishearten you if you don't have a good grasp already.  ""The Jazz Pianist"" is a good intro to left-hand comping and chord theory. Schoenberg is probably going to be over your head if you're just starting out."

You'll learn more from looking at a Beethoven score than reading about it.  Anyway - Theory of Harmony is good, but take a look at the Persichetti as well. Not sure what you want to get out of it, so maybe the Schoenberg is better?  And Principles of Orchestration.. It's great, and Rimsky literally wrote the book on Orchestration.. but Sam Adler's book is WAY more up to date, has far more examples and is a better overview. You can also get an accompanying CD so you can hear what's going on. There are certain technical things that are better explained in Principles of Orch, but you can find most of that online once you get a decent overview of what you're looking for.  Missing from the list? Preparatory Exercises in Score Reading, a subscription to any kind of online music journal, and SCORES."
musictheory,3d1j0v,MpegEVIL,11,Sun Jul 12 19:30:21 2015 UTC,"Answering with reference to jazz here.  So altered, as a very basic definition, is a chord in which the fifth and ninth have to be altered. So #5 #9, b5 b9, or some combination thereof, or maybe they're omitted.  As a pianist, I tend to go b5 and b9 because they're the tones one would have to go to in order to get close to a tritone sub. (Example: C major, b5 is Gb, b9 is Db, and then the seventh and third reverse within each chord - either C or Gb - and you get a choice of two seventh chords a tritone apart. Hope that makes sense.)  But do whatever - alt means 5 and 9 are in some way altered or possibly omitted. Have fun. Whatever fits the piece or your mood."
musictheory,3d1j0v,PadstheFish,6,Sun Jul 12 20:34:13 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. But I would like to add that if a chord is notated ""C7(b5 b9)"" instead of ""C7 alt"", etc. you can play C7(#5 #9) or C7(b5 #9) or C7(#5 b9) so it is a case of choose your own adventure.   Usually having an altered chord called for is because the melody dictates it as such and because of this a standard 5 will sound wrong in your chord against a b5 for example. Since the #5 would be a whole step away though it jives.  Now as far as scales go, check the super locrian mode aka the altered scale as /u/natetet pointed out."
musictheory,3d1j0v,engartst,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"if a chord is notated ""C7(b5 b9)"" instead of ""C7 alt""   Do you mean the other way around?   Usually having an altered chord called for is because the melody dictates it as such and because of this a standard 5 will sound wrong in your chord against a b5 for example.   Why do we have to alter the 9 in that scenario?"
musictheory,3d1j0v,Bromskloss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:56:30 2015 UTC,"No, I mean if instead of a chord symbol saying alt it prescribes which flavor of alt chord then you can choose your own adventure instead of going by what it says but use context/your ear.  Also, you have to change the 9 if you want a fully altered chord bc if you don't you just have a chord with a b5 which isn't what alt means. Nothing wrong with using only b5 but in the case of reading a chart with alt chords notated there is one more step to take."
musictheory,3d1j0v,engartst,2,Mon Jul 13 14:20:38 2015 UTC,"I was taught that, in a jazz context, alt means you would use the altered scale:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_scale  in which the bottom tetrachord is like the octotonic scale and the upper tetrachord is like a whole tone scale."
musictheory,3d1j0v,natetet,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"The altered scale has the root, the major third, and only the notes that are not in the Ionian major. Flat 2, sharp 2, flat 5, flat 6, flat 7.  On the piano, in C, this means C, E, and all of the black keys.   When playing an alt chord, you need the major 3rd and flat 7th. Everything else is up to you as long as it's in the alt scale."
musictheory,3d1j0v,Icommentor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:50 2015 UTC,"I normally voice the alt chord as a b6 major upper structure, so Ab/C7. This gives the alterations of #5 #9. Just my own easy way of going for an alt chord."
musictheory,3d1j0v,Zcott,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Won't be a ton of help, but from what I have read and heard, when you see ""alt"" on a lead sheet, it means there are myriad ways to harmonize that melody note or notes using a specific bass note. So you could raise or lower by half step the 5th or any extension in the chord. I think the altered chord came from man different performances and transcriptions of a piece not agreeing on certain chords."
musictheory,3d34yw,Noicce,8,Mon Jul 13 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Considering that the 5th of extended chords is often omitted, the simplest name for this chord would probably be Cm11."

musictheory,3d34yw,Continuo,2,Mon Jul 13 09:37:10 2015 UTC,"You're correct. I actually prefer the notation Cm7(11) to Cm7add11, but that's just personal preference. Besides, in a jazz context it's common to just write Cm7 and let the musician decide which tensions to include (unless a more specific voicing is desired)."
musictheory,3d34yw,K_Rayfish,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but extended chords usually have omitted notes. Otherwise a true 13th chord contains literally all 7 notes in the scale. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)."

musictheory,3d34yw,exscape,7,Mon Jul 13 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"It's an inverted quartal (stack of 4ths) - Eb Bb F C C F Eb Bb, but if you're getting it from a song it's likely a C minor 7 sus 4 with a missing fifth."
musictheory,3d34yw,guitarelf,7,Mon Jul 13 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say its more likely an F7sus4 in second inversion (if it is voiced as op has written it). It's quite tenuous to claim its an rearranged quartal chord without knowing its context. That being said, I don't think there is a right answer with this chord without its context, so you could be right.  Also, I'm nitpicking now, but what you have written for the quartal chord (Eb Bb F C) is actually a quintal chord. The quartal arrangement would be the inverse (C F Bb Eb)."
musictheory,3d34yw,Continuo,3,Mon Jul 13 09:33:06 2015 UTC,Agreed - quintal is definitely right (although out of context doesn't make much sense)...although I guess all quintals are also quartals!

In both of the following examples, D is going to be a non-chord tone between E and C (assume the harmony is just a C major chord).  1   2   3   4  E   G   D   C   1   2  3   4  E   D  C   C   By falling on a strong beat in the first example, D would be considered an appoggiatura. In the second example, it falls on a weak beat, so it's only a passing tone. It's hard to describe in text, but basically the effect is that an appoggiatura is usually more striking, because it often coincides with a chord change, e.g. the melody landing on a D when the harmony changes to C major. Passing tones usually don't happen at the same time as a change of harmony, so they're more subtle.  EDIT: see /u/crabapplesteam's comment below for a fuller explanation. I've fixed my example."

musictheory,3d18e6,CrownStarr,2,Sun Jul 12 19:38:14 2015 UTC,"The traditional definition of an appoggiatura is a rhythmically or metrically accented non-chord tone that is not prepared as a chord tone in the previous chord (as would a suspension). That simply means the non-chord tone falls on a relatively strong beat. The traditional definition of a passing tone requires that it fall on a weak beat. Today, however, sometimes appogiaturas are called ""accented passing tones"" or ""accented neighbor tones,"" for the sake of making the function of the note clear."
musictheory,3d18e6,Cdesese,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that one of the other defining features of an appogiatura is that it is often (always?) approached by an upward leap, resolving downward stepwise into a chord tone. Where did you hear about appogiatura's called 'accented passing tones'?  Edit: I'm not trying to be provocative - just genuinely curious. I have a few sources that say 'leap+step' is the defining characteristic, and I would be curious to read other sources that state otherwise."
musictheory,3d18e6,crabapplesteam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:08:22 2015 UTC,"I believe that extremely narrow definition of an appoggiatura as an ""accented incomplete upper neighbor"" is a modern one that has little to do with the traditional definition, which can be put simply as ""accented dissonant tone that isn't a suspension.""

musictheory,3d18e6,crabapplesteam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:06:33 2015 UTC,"Like I said, many modern books define an appoggiatura that way, so you'll find such definitions. But the traditional definition is simply ""accented non-chord tone."" I quote William Drabkin's Grove article on the ""Non-harmonic note"":   Any non-harmonic note that occurs on a relatively strong beat is an appoggiatura (Fr. appoggiature; Ger. Vorschlag), though it is generally understood that the note must be articulated on that beat; when it is tied over, as a consonant note, from the previous chord it is called a suspension (Fr. suspension; Ger. Vorhalt; It. sospensione). An appoggiatura is often approached by leap, either in the same direction as the resolution or the opposite one; or it may be an accented passing note, diatonic or chromatic. When it occurs in the previous chord as a consonant note but is not tied over, it is called a prepared appoggiatura."

musictheory,3d1s6k,Rideron150,2,Sun Jul 12 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"Ok, so what I see is a 4-3 suspension.   The first chord you marked i (g minor), the root (g) is doubled somewhere above the bass. Then the bass takes the  fifth degree, you marked it V, the dominant, yet the g from the previous chord is held (or suspended) over this new bass creating the 4 you see in the figuration. In the next chord the bass is repeated an octave lower, and now # is shown in the figuration, indicating that the 4 has come down to the 3 (the g that was held over has now taken f#, leading tone of g minor) resolving the suspension downwards in the usual manner.  Typically root position chords need no figuration (as in the chord you marked i) but in the case of the last d a figuration is needed because the resolution of the suspension must be shown, and because the passage is in a minor key, the leading tone must be indicated.  Some would say that the suspension is not clearly marked and that therefore it could very well be not a suspension but something else. Maybe. I think that depends on who wrote your score and how careful was said person in marking things; it comes down to the editing. In theory (as in analysis), one thing can often be seen from multiple angles.  I have given you my take, I see a suspension."
musictheory,3d1s6k,porcos3,2,Mon Jul 13 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"It's a 4-3 suspension. Notice that you have a D in the bass for the first chord, and then it goes down an octave to another D. The first chord is a suspended V chord, then the second is a regular V triad."
musictheory,3d1s6k,BdaMann,0,Sun Jul 12 21:13:38 2015 UTC,It looks like a candential 6 4.  Not functionally a 4-3 suspension if thats the case.

musictheory,3d1s6k,BdaMann,2,Mon Jul 13 04:22:08 2015 UTC,It's not a cadential 6/4. It's a V chord with a 4-3 suspension in it. The sharp represents the sharped third of the V chord. A cadential 6/4 would have both 6 and 4 in the figures.
musictheory,3d1s6k,Cdesese,0,Tue Jul 14 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"A cadential 6/4 should have the 6 and 4 in the figures, but I think this is just a poorly done figured bass, and the textbook or whatever probably was looking for a cadential 6/4."
musictheory,3d1s6k,BdaMann,2,Tue Jul 14 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"It is poorly done, but I see absolutely no reason to assume this must be a cadential 6/4. There is no 6 anywhere in sight.  I would guess that the sloppy presentation is a result of the notation software attaching the figures to the notes themselves rather than to the staff, and thus because the bass leaps down an octave at the point where the ""4"" resolves to ""#,"" the ""#"" moves down with it.  Good formatting would have all of the figures lined up nicely, because it's easier to read that way, but it's not necessary."
musictheory,3d1s6k,Cdesese,2,Tue Jul 14 01:20:28 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm not sure how figured bass is any less ambiguous than jazz nomenclature. Both require you to fill in gaps that the written symbols sometimes don't give you. But as long as you are fluent in the style, it conveys all the information a player needs. In fact, some of the more specific information would seem unnecessary and overly cumbersome to a fluent musician in the style."

Even though one could argue, as arhombus does, that its not clearly marked and all, I think that is only because the person who wrote the figuration in the OP's example was a bit careless in not doing so clearly.   I don't think that quoting that score of a work by Bach proves anything for the reason of the inverse. Who ever edited the work into that nice looking score was very careful to have everything indicated nicely (hyphens and spaces, etc.). I have never seen Bach's manuscripts so I cannot say how clear or unclear his markinga are regarding these things, so I do not know whether they match todays standard for clarity.

And both tend to use pentatonic and heptatonic scales.   Gamelan of Indonesia has a unique tuning system based on a pentatonic nearly equal temperament scale called slendro and a 7 tone scale of varying width called pelog. The exact tuning of a gamelan ensemble tends to vary slightly from one to the next, and can't be very well approximated in 12 Tet.

musictheory,3d0joi,Rush2112AW,-3,Sun Jul 12 21:50:38 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, switching between non-compound time signature sounds like shit because the value of a quarter note is carried over. Saying it breaks temporal expectations is an understatement; rather, it breaks the entire temporal framework of the piece. I generally advise against switching unless you really know what you're doing. There are a few ways that I know to make switching more seamless.   Denote the time signature switch as the beginning of a new section. It'll still sound weird, but at least it isolates the weirdness in a whole new section. That means switch up the theme, the motifs, the instrumentation, the rhythm, etc. Carry over a secondary (less-important) motif to the new section, one which fits well into the new time signature. If switching from 4/4 to 3/4, you can bring over a motif that had three notes in the original section and refit its length into the new section. Bridge the sections over. The bridge can a measure or two also with a different time signature. Here you can ""glue"" the clashing temporal motifs of the two sections, while emphasizing that some temporal magic is going on. Or, the bridge can be atemporal, to be played with great expression, in rubato.  Alternatively, to avoid all this extra work, don't retain the length of a quarter note, but the length of a whole measure. If you were switching from 3/4 to 4/4, that would sound like switching from triplets of a measure to quadruplets of a measure. You can also make a bridge here, except instead of rubato or an irregular time signature, you can do overlapping time signatures, e.g. melody takes 4/4 while bass is still in 3/4"

No one would listen to the Song I posted for OP and consider the entire thing in 4/4. But even still, moving from triplets to duplets is a modulation.

I provided you with an example of waltz in 3/4 written as 6/8 (6/8 and 12/8 being identical.)   6/8 isn't a waltz. 3/4 is a simple meter, 6/8 is a compound meter. 12/8 is a compound meter. 3/4 is NOT the same thing as 12/8. 3/4 is NOT the same thing as 6/8.  If your original song had gone from 3/4 to 12/8 I would have completely accepted that as rhythmic modulation.   You already agreed that 12/8 is a compound meter, which assuming you know what compound meter means, you realize that you wouldn't ever see 12/8 being used as three groupings of four. Three groupings of four is the same thing as 3/4. Three groupings of four is a simple meter.  The waltz wasn't in 12/8...it was written in 3/4 because it was 3/4...because a waltz is in 3/4... 12/8 cannot be heard, only assumed  6/8 is tripletized 2/4. 12/8 is tripletized 4/4.   You don't say 2/4 is the same thing as 4/4 do you?   When you see someone asking about rhythmic modulation, they're asking about how to modulate from simple to compound or complex. Not from simple to simple or compound to compound - In a sense they are interchangeable.   You are objectively wrong. Stop digging yourself deeper. I'm only arguing with you because I don't want other people to be misguided by your BS.

musictheory,3d0joi,Debusatie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"I will also try to explain it to you, slowly, with an example. The thing about 12/8 is you can group the phrases in either three or two. That is what makes 12/8 time rhyhmically rich and able to subsume 3/4. Polyrhythms and metric entrainment fall out naturally from it.  The African 12/8 Bell X-X-XX-X-X-X is typically heard by people as a pattern in 3/4, since the beats occur in duplets, however, it is felt simultaneously as triplet groups of two or four as |X-X|-XX|-X-|X-X|. Dancers step in fours to the triplet time, and the rhythm can be grouped as either duplet or triplet, depending on the drum part. That is what is going on in the music. When batá drums are played, as in my example, the bell pattern itself is absent but implied.   Here is another example I have of Voo da Mosca notated in 3/4 rather than 6/8.   http://imgur.com/W54lFPP  If you think that 12/8 is the same as 4/4, then you must think that 10/8 is the same as 4/4, since it's just quintuplets."
musictheory,3d0joi,setecordas,2,Sun Jul 12 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"i just read everything you wrote and ur idea of time signatures is really off. polyrhythms don't naturally fall out of time signatures, u could hear a piece in 3/4 and count 4/4 over it (as a polyrhyhtm) but the piece is still written in 3/4, because that's how the composer wrote it. u don't say ur waltz is in 12/8 but written in 3/4. that makes no sense, its in 3/4 because its written in 3/4. just because you can count 12/8 out of it, doesn't mean its 12/8.  also don't use X's on this subreddit. This subreddit is based on western music notation, and none of us will know what X-X-XX-X-X-X means. in western context 12-8 is a 4-4 with triplets, thats really all it is to it.   in ur example, it has nothing to do with 6/8. its written in 3-4. if u put 6/8 it would sound very different because 3-4 the pulse falls on beats 1, 2, and 3. In 6-8 the pulses are on 1 and 4.   finally 10/8 has nothing to do with quintuplets. its a odd time signature like 7-8, 5-4, or 11-8."
musictheory,3d0joi,Plsgivkrama,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:05:37 2015 UTC,"Man. Where to start. I've already provided examples of sheet music showing two waltzes, one from Brazil, one from Venezuala, both conceived in 3/4 one publication and 6/8 in another. We are not in Venetian Waltz territory, but African diaspora territory here. The music makes use of hemiola, and in the case of Venezuala music, extensive use. The phrases are often conceived in both 3/4 and 6/8, or alternating, due to where the one feels the stress falls.   The notation that I provided is used standardly in the west, when notation software is not available or not needed. It's pretty simple to figure it out, and if you haven't then that's on you. The bell pattern is a 12/8 pattern. Sometimes it is referred to as a 6/8 pattern when using the term in the sense of afrocuban clave. The pattern is felt in triplet pulses of four, though it is naively heard by many as a 3/4 pattern. Here is a video of pattern below. I challenge you to find someone who would call this pattern a 4/4 pattern. It is always referenced as either 6/8 or 12/8 because those two time signatures are equivalent.   http://youtu.be/jHLHiBjWOaw  Few people are going to notate an entire song with a 12/8 feel as 4/4 triplets, but they may notate it as 12/8, or 6/8 if they want the phrase to extend over two bars rather than one (the only difference between 12/8 and 6/8) and they will also often use 3/4 time signature instead."

Not only have you shown yourself not to know what you are talking about, but I have had to spend my time showing you that 12/8 is not 4/4, that 12/8 and 6/8 are the same metric but with different phrase lengths, that 3/4 and 6/8 are often used interchangeably in scores depending on perception of stress, and provided examples showing the same songs published as 6/8 and 3/4, and explained to you how the 12/8 bell pattern is seen as both 6/8, 12/8, and 3/4 pattern, never as a 4/4 pattern. 12/8 to 4/4 requires that a metric modulations occurs."

EGBC# will sound more like a minor triad (though depending on use it could also sound like C# half diminished). On the other hand EGBC will sound like a major triad with a major 7.   Of course, in practice you could have an Em b6 (what you're describing). It would depend entirely on the context of the chord."

This is just a difference between pop vs serious analysis.   Walter Piston would not have analyzed your example as an E chord.  He would call it a seventh chord, with C# as root, and in first inversion if E is in the bass.  It's fine to call it a C# chord if you are in B minor and the progression is II-V-I, aka C#m7-5 F#7 Bm.   It is just as good as calling it IV-V-I aka Em6 F#7 Bm.

musictheory,3cxaxi,3d4f5g,6,Sat Jul 11 22:57:21 2015 UTC,"I like to think of extended chords as all having two names:   the theoretically correct complete name The conventional name that is actually used in practice   You can think of Em6 (""E minor six"") as being a conventional shorthand for EmM6 (""E minor major six""). In the full theoretical nomenclature, the minor refers to the quality of the triad. The major refers to the quality of the six.   You may have noticed that common chords often have a shorthand name. Less common chords, such as a minor major seven chord, use the full theoretical name because there isn't really a shorthand convention.  The shorthand version I think came about in order to have an easy way to communicate these common chords. I don't think they always make perfect sense. It's kind of like memorizing a Chinese character; you just have to memorize it!  Just remember, if you need to get really specific with the full theoretical name:  1 is not mentioned. The rest of the scale degrees are mentioned in ascending numerical order. The 3 is assumed (unmentioned), but it's quality is given (major/minor). The 5 is only mentioned if it is not a perfect fifth, otherwise it is sharp or flat. all other intervals in the chord should be preceded by their quality (minor/major, sharp/flat, augmented/diminished double sharp, double flat etc.)"
musictheory,3cxaxi,Duckmandu,4,Sun Jul 12 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"There's actually quite a few different minor scales, so saying an E minor scale has a C isn't quite accurate. An E aeolian scale, or an E harmonic minor scale has a C, but an E dorian or E melodic minor scale would have a C#. As has been said, an Em6 must have the major 6th, so therefore the related scale to the chord must be one of the two latter scales mentioned. The scale doesn't have to be diatonic to the key centre."
musictheory,3cxaxi,mharray,3,Sun Jul 12 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"The way I was taught to understand chord symbols (by a jazz teacher) is that ""minor"" (or whatever symbol you prefer to use for it) refers only to the third. e.g. the only difference between a C13 and a Cm13 would be the Eb instead of the E, even though 7 and 11 are different in major and minor scales. Similarly, the 7 is assumed to be dominant (flat), and the term major refers only to the 7 and means it should be raised a half step. Hope that is helpful and makes sense."
musictheory,3cxaxi,king_clovis,2,Sun Jul 12 03:13:47 2015 UTC,"Same reason the chord E7 contains a D, even though the 7th note in the E scale is a D#.  Because that's how the chords are defined.  Remember, the jazz shorthand for chord symbols is meant to tell the player what the chord is in the music, not the other way around.  People quite often write this E G B C# chord, so they decided to give it the name Em6 since it's an Em chord with a 6 added.  They didn't come up with the name first then come up with a chord to represent it.  By the way, the m6 chord is an inversion of the ø7 chord.  So, for example, Fm6 has the same notes as Dø7.  It can go in the same place.  For example, instead of Dø7 - G7 - Cm9, you can substitute for the first chord and have Fm6 - G7/F - EbM7, which has a nice bass line and a rootless voicing for the Cm9 at the end.  As you may have noticed, the m6 chord doesn't come from that minor scale.  Em6 doesn't come from the E minor scale.  It comes from the B minor scale.  That said, you can totally use it in E dorian, for example, which has that C#, or anywhere you feel like."

If it was a major seventh, the chord would be Cmaj7 with a B.   But you're probably thinking that C major doesn't have a Bb, so how can the chord have a Bb? Well simply, a C7 chord does not relate to C major - it relates to C mixolydian, which is the 5th mode of F major. (There are a few other possible related scales, but mixolydian is the most common)"

You gotta think about the notes in the chords and the melodies they create.  Then you can add whatever you want to your chords and see how it affects those melodies.  The harmonies are actually secondary to the melodies.  You gotta be thinking, what note do you want in there?  Where does that note need to go to resolve?  Where is it actually going?  For example, if you have a sus4 chord, that's a dissonance.  How are you going to resolve it?  C F G.  How do you resolve that?  C E G?  Or B F G?  Or even C F A?  That's what matters, and you need to decide all those things yourself.  Listen to and analyze enough music to get a good vocabulary, and you'll get a feel for what you like to do."

I'm not even close to rejecting traditional music theory.  What I'm rejecting is the simplistic view of music theory that only considers chords vertically -- a view that's somewhat prevalent in this community, since a lot of people here basically only understand music theory through chords.  On the other hand, if you look at, say, JS Bach, he was the master of voice leading, which is what really drives Western music -- even more than the chords themselves.  None of this is even remotely controversial.  The original question was about using ""extended"" chords, or at least flavors other than minor triad/major triad/dominant 7th.  And the answer is ""use them when you feel like it and when the voice leading suggests it"", and to know when you feel like it and when the voice leading suggests it, you need to do your own analysis.  Again, not controversial.  So I don't know why I was downvoted, but I also don't particularly care so long as people have gained a better understanding of music theory."

It's become popular in movies for exactly this sort of thing: ""emotional,"" sometimes magical moods.  I might attribute the rise of this kind of music in movies and tv shows to the immense popularity of Polish composer Henryk Górecki's Symphony No. 3 back in the 90s, which uses a similar ""diatonic mush"" style. A CD of the symphony is one of the best-selling classical albums of all time, and it was used in a number of film scores. So, naturally, film and tv composers started to imitate the same sound.  Another relevant piece would be Samuel Barber's ""Adagio for Strings,"" the orchestral version, which since its use in the movie Platoon as the score to the death of Willem Dafoe's character has practically become a cliche."

That, combined with the fact that figured bass isn't taught much outside of the classical realm, is a reason why you'd be justified in writing iM7/3.

The sound of a major tonic triad surrounded by minor and Phyrgian modal elements does indeed create a striking, exotic sound, and maybe ""curiosity"" best captures the overall effect."
musictheory,3cwi1i,Cdesese,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:24:15 2015 UTC,"Huh, I assumed it was in C major on account of it favoring F over F# in every instance and because the clarinet part, as I've transcribed it, uses all the note in C major and nothing else. I also don't perceive much of a release of tension at all when it goes to the G chord. Could it not also be the case that it's borrowing notes from C minor instead?  I apologize if I sound critical of your answer, because I really appreciate it. I'm just trying to understand all this."
musictheory,3cwi1i,Cdesese,2,Sat Jul 11 14:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're disqualifying G just because there's no F#, then I don't see how you could argue for C, especially when there are hardly any C chords, and those that do appear aren't very prominent. Notice that there are pretty regular phrase groups of two bars each (according to your transcription), and almost all of them begin with some sort of G chord. I'd say this phrase structure, especially the emphasis of these chords at the beginning of each phrase, is more important than the abstract scalar collection in determining what we hear as the tonic. But even the scales don't necessarily contradict a G-centered interpretation. For instance, there is such a thing as a G Mixolydian mode, a G major mode but with F instead of F# (so the same notes as a C major scale). This would account for what the clarinet is doing (also, the new section that begins shortly after where your transcription ends is very strongly G Mixolydian). And the piano part mostly adds up to what could be called a G ""major Phrygian"" mode, by which I mean a G Phrygian mode with B-natural."
musictheory,3cwi1i,Cdesese,2,Sat Jul 11 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Another point, about harmony: while there is no conventional dominant chord of G (D major or D7), we sometimes get a first inversion F minor chord at the end of a phrase that resolves to a G chord at the beginning of the next phrase. It's not too hard to hear this as a kind of dominant-to-tonic resolution--indeed, it's what's sometimes called a ""Phrygian cadence."" The Ab resolving down to G is an analogue to F# resolving up to G."
musictheory,3cwi1i,Cdesese,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:15:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I didn't know that the primary note of a mode had any bearing on the key. There must be some sort of limitations on that though, right? I mean, you wouldn't say it were in G if it were based around the same notes that are in G aeolian, right? Where's the line drawn?  edit: Disregard that. The tool I use for scales gave me the wrong scale for aeolian and I forgot that aeolian is essentially just a minor key scale. I blame a lack of sleep. z_z"
musictheory,3cwi1i,Cdesese,2,Sat Jul 11 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"Let me put it this way: we can think of tonal center and scale as being separate things. I can have music that is centered on G, and that music can make use of any number of G scales: G Ionian (major), G Aeolian (minor), G Mixolydian, G Phrygian, G Melodic Minor, G Blues, G Pentatonic, etc. Major and minor scales aren't the only possibilities. Just because you can tally up the notes and fit them into a C major or minor scale doesn't necessarily mean that C is the tonal center. You have to listen to the music--its harmony, its melodic gestures (notice how the clarinet sometimes outlines a G triad and D-G perfect fourth, and never a C triad), and especially its phrase structure, where cadences fall--to detect the tonal center."

Learn what a 2-5-1 is etc.  Jazzers also are able to spell their chords MUCH more simply and logically than traditional classical theory.

musictheory,3ct1az,SummonKnight,9,Fri Jul 10 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that piece a prime example of counterpoint. To my ear, it sounds more homophonic: the cello is playing a melody and the piano is playing mostly background figures (though the background figures are quite active). For something to be referred to as counterpoint, two or more voices need to be acting independent of each other, whereas the piano in that piece is more often acting directly to complement the cello.  For standard examples of counterpoint, I'd encourage you to look at pieces from the likes of Des Prez and Palestrina, two Renaissance composers. Not all counterpoint has to be this old, but these guys were masters and these pieces are pure examples of counterpoint. Good luck and enjoy!"
musictheory,3ct1az,indianatrumpet,7,Fri Jul 10 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"Not really, no. There are certainly contrapuntal elements to it, but mostly what we have here is the piano arpeggiating chords to accompany the cello melody, rather than both instruments playing melodies that are set against each other and equal in prominence. Here's a good example of counterpoint in two voices, in the 18th century style.  If you're interested in learning to write counterpoint, I recommend picking up and working through Mann's translation of The Study of Counterpoint by Fux, which has been the standard for learning contrapuntal technique for almost 300 years.  If you're interested in learning to write music like the song you linked, learning counterpoint is a good foundation and will help with harmonizing. Books on 18th century counterpoint usually have sections on melody writing, and you'll want to get a book on harmony (I like Piston) to learn how to write chord progressions to accompany a melody, as is happening in this piece."
musictheory,3ct1az,brutishbloodgod,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:52:51 2015 UTC,"Here's the simple answer.  Counterpoint means ""note against note."" There have to be at least two ""melodic"" lines happening at once for there to be counterpoint.   In your example, the melody is mostly either doubled in the piano or traded off between the piano and cello - there are however some contrapuntal moments."
musictheory,3ct1az,ZoomBlah,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"I would treat that as being closer to activated homophony. While there is some foreshadowing of the solo section for the piano, it isn't really given the same weight as the melody in the cello to fit that equality and independence that I would call counterpoint.  One of my favorite examples of counterpoint for a modern context is I've Got a Feeling, by the Beatles.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9HTsW2aWBU  For the music you're listening to, the best thing to do is to transcribe and study what it is you like about that music, and add those tools to your composer's toolbox. I could tell you what's going on, but I don't think it would be fair to you for me to tell you instead of you getting to discover the techniques- especially if it's something you are passionate about."
musictheory,3ctrzy,mallo15,2,Fri Jul 10 18:37:29 2015 UTC,"It would be B-D-F, or a bdim chord because those are the notes within the key of C major.   A B major chord is not diatonic within the key of C major due to the #2 (D#) and #4 (F#). You can implement the B Major triad, but this would be an example of modal mixture, or borrowed chords. Which is taking chords from another key.   An example of that is that you can make it a B7 B-D#-F#-A and use that as a pivot V7 to modulate to E major too.  All in all. The chords are usually - not always- dictated by the key signature. Scale degrees 2 and 4 within C major are natural because C major has no accidentals. If you use chords or scale degrees outside of that, you're implying other keys... Which is super hip."
musictheory,3ctrzy,Ninjaplease77,2,Fri Jul 10 19:28:58 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, a B major chord is B D# F# (major third interval on the bottom, minor third interval on top).   In the key C major, however, B is the 7th degree, which is a diminished B chord (2 minor 3rds built on top of each other). So if you wanted to make a diatonic B chord (meaning play B in the key of C), the chord should be spelled BDF.  This explains what the quality of the chord should be within a major or minor key signature.   Hope that helps.  Edit: If you're new to theory, I would start with learning the circle of fifths, which will help you understand key signatures and how to build chords."
musictheory,3ctrzy,peace_of_m1nd,2,Fri Jul 10 18:54:35 2015 UTC,The second option; you want the chords to be in key. So all the chords in Cmajor would be:   C major CEG  D minor D F A  E minor E G B  F major F A C  G major G B D  A minor A C E  B diminished B D F
musictheory,3ctrzy,Mikep98,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:05:23 2015 UTC,"So yeah, B is naturally the 7th scale degree of C major and associated with a diminished chord. However, that's not to say that it's impossible for you to use a B major chord in your theoretical song in C major. For example, you could simply modulate (i.e. change the tonic from C major to B major). You could even implement a Bmaj chord as the secondary dominant of e minor, the third scale degree (V/iii)."

Then rotate who does what. It's really fun and good training for all."

EDIT: Do you think dividing up the parts among a number of students and having them perform the score at keyboards rather than singing would be useful? Or perhaps have pairs of students perform the score as a piano duet?"
musictheory,3cqz4s,ecstatic_broccoli,3,Fri Jul 10 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"I meant having, say, two students play at the keyboard and the rest singing. Orchestral scores have a lot of transposing instruments, so even singing one line really helps with that. Plus, doing it together teaches you to hear the whole score as an ensemble.  Even without any singing, I do think having students play duets is a great way to realize scores with more than just a couple of parts.  One more thing, another very practical score reading skill is choral scores with SATB, tenors in treble clef sounding down the octave. It's easier than String Quartet score since there's no alto clef, but it's very practical since any pianists that become accompanists almost surely have to read this open score from time to time (and potentially quite often)."

It is good for improving your ear, learning how to pick out individual instruments and parts.  I don't really expect that my students will be able to sight read scores by the end of the class. In fact I'm not really planning on actually having them read anything at sight; everything is to be prepared in advance. So it's less about developing sight-reading skills than it's about just getting them exposed to score reading, so that they might begin to develop their ability to understand a complex score, with multiple parts in multiple clefs. It's just such a valuable skill to have, for so many reasons.  These are college music majors. Some are pianists; most aren't. But they've all been doing keyboard work as part of the core theory curriculum for several semesters now. The music they'll be playing will mostly require playing chords of up to four notes, with up to three notes in the right hand and at least one in the left (in four-part music, sometimes the left hand will play the lower two parts). As far as piano technique goes, it's not asking much.  As for the alto clef, these students will have already been exposed to the alto clef for several semesters in multiple classes and contexts, so while they may not be fluent in it, they are expected to at least be somewhat familiar with it."

Another suggestion I thought of is not only listening while following along, but then following up with a somewhat detailed analysis of the score - i.e., identifying chords and implied progressions, cadences and their various types, thematic material etc. Doing exercises like this really advanced my ability to look at a score and be able to see the overarching idea of the piece, and ""zoom in"" from there.

Then you can introduce them to the tenor clef. If you think that that would be too much, you could use the alto as a high tenor, and have 2 trebles on top, a bass naturally at the bottom.  You say the pieces won't be technically demanding at all, and these are musicians you are training, right? So they should learn properly. Don't hold their hands too much.

If, by some miracle, they don't find that challenging enough, I'll introduce the tenor clef.  They're musicians, but they're not all pianists. And even the pianists are probably not very good score readers. I want to minimize the physical demands of this already very taxing mental exercise, so I'm using only music with simple textures, slow tempos, no scales and arpeggios, and so on.

For example, lets say the first time you go through the progression you could use the Ab7 to resolve to G7 to get you back to C.

Basically, the elements I used to create the sound is by playing m2 and m2 dissonances off of the open strings, dim7th chords, whole tone scale sequences (not strict whole tone scales), and use of the augmented triad. A triple feel can tend to make something feel it has a faster tempo than if it was in a duple meter. It's sort of an auditory illusion. And suddenly putting the melodic line in the bass pulls your attention to another sonic area.   These techniques are common in some of the crazier classical guitar rep."

Sometimes, one of the alterations is preferred over the others because of voice leading or because of the melody. Also, some chords give you multiple options when soloing. A 7b9 chord can imply an altered scale or a diminished scale or a phrygian dominant scale. A 7b5 chord could imply an altered scale or a whole tone scale. A 7#9 chord would work great with a blues pentatonic scale in addition to the altered scale."

So whatever your metronome marking is for the 4/4 time section, make it 25% faster for the 5/4 section.

A measure in 4, filled with quintuplets, all in 4-note groupings, would equal your new quarter note in 5|4.  There are 20 quintuplets in a bar of 4|4 and 20 sixteenth notes in a bar of 5|4. You can find the actual numerical value of the new tempo the way /u/Cdesese lays out.  As far as how you'd notate it in a part, I'd write a single 16th note with a ""5"" over it, followed by an ""equals"" sign, followed by a single 16th note. This is how I've seen stuff like this written in percussion music.  EDIT: I'm not sure why I added in the whole ""16th notes"" thing. I'll leave my post as is but add onto it.  The thing I said about writing the tempo change as 16th = 16th with a 5 over the first one will still work, just use whatever note values you were wanting to use. A ""(5 over a) half note = quarter note"" would work fine, but might be a little confusing. You might consider sticking with quarters but writing the 4|4 parts using smaller note values. For instance, if you were going to write two bars of 8th notes in 4, just write one bar of 16ths in 4. Obviously, in the end it's up to you.  The music I've read that does this tends to stick to small subdivisions (like my 16ths example) because, at least for drummers, that's the easiest way to mentally navigate the tempo change."

If you are on paper, then it's quite easy, just set quarter note equal to a quintuplet quarter note. However if you are on Finale or something along those lines, it may just be time to bust out the math. For example, in 4/4, if  a quarter note passes at 120, a full measure passes at a 30 bpm. multiply this by 5, and you get quarter note equals 150. At this point, now that you are in 5/4, the measure will still pass at a rate of 30 bpm, however your new quarter note will be the same length as the old quintuplet note. Hope this helps, best of luck to you."

The III chord doesn't really have much about that could be called dissonant, so it doesn't really need to ""resolve"" anywhere in particular.  If what you're looking for are good suggestions as to where to go next, well, you could go back to i if you want. Going to VI might be nice too. TBH, questions of harmonic syntax (""What chord can I go to now?"") are very style-specific. What sort of style of music are you trying to make? For example, if you're going for something rooted in a classical style, ""i-II-III"" is not a good progression at all. But it would be fine in a pop- or rock-style piece."

Melodic movement by up or down to your tonic by a minor 2nd, up by a perfect 4th, and down by a perfect 5th tend to feel like resolutions. Outward motion of an augmented fourth to a P5 or inward motion of a diminished fifth to a P4 will feel like resolutions.  III chords in minor and iii chords in major share two or more common tones with the tonic chord and no dissonance so there won't be a sense of resolution if you move from the III/iii to i/I."

In bb. 3-5 of the second example there are some things I don't think sound nice. Firstly the leading note in the bass part in b. 3 doesn't rise, it doesn't sound right to me because it goes up to the leading note and then down again, without the tonic nearby, unlike the first example. There is an interval of a diminished 5th between the bass note of b. 3 and the treble note in b. 4, which, combined with the leap in the treble melody, makes it stand out too much for me. Finally, there is a melodic interval of a diminished 5th in the treble part from bb. 4-5.  In bb. 3-4 of the last example, there parts land on an interval of a perfect 5th in similar motion, with a leap in the treble, which isn't nice. In bb. 5-6, the treble part has a melodic interval of a diminished 5th.  On the whole, the part-writing is pretty good. I've written quite a lot but there really isn't much wrong."

If anything, one would want to avoid creating a cadential effect too early in the exercise. So I don't see anything wrong with the descending F# in m. 3 of the second exercise. I believe some approaches to species counterpoint forbid tritone cross-relations (like the one you have between mm. 3 and 4 of the second example). Knud Jeppesen, for instance, says that the tritone cross-relation resulting from parallel stepwise progression of major thirds (e.g., F-A to G-B, cross-relation between F and B) means that this progression usually should be avoided (but he does not forbid it, and shows examples of the progression in Palestrina). Such cross relations can be treated by using an accidental (Bb). In melodies, use only consonances. That means your d5 leaps in the second and third examples need to go. Some rules even forbid the major sixth in melodies on the grounds that in the Renaissance it was seen as a very harsh interval. Approach perfect consonances by contrary motion only. Similar motion (also know as direct motion) into perfect consonances is forbidden in strict species counterpoint.   Peter Schubert's species counterpoint textbook is the most up-to-date, authoritative textbook on Renaissance-style species counterpoint."

But thinking harmonically, that chord V tends to be followed by either I or VI for very good reasons, whereas here it is followed by chord which could be interpreted as either II or IV. This is a weak progression because it defies the circle of fifths and makes the tonality ambiguous, in addition to the leading note not behaving normally. I think it is no coincidence that other mistakes follow this unusual progression.  Changing the treble note in b. 4 to a G or a B solves every problem in the example. I'm convinced the leading note resolution is not the problem. :)"

Any intermediate performer (classical or not) should be able to read that rhythm without issue.  If it's actually swung, then you may want to write it that way instead of just instructing her to swing it.  Classical players aren't really accustomed to doing that.

For example, the three open strings at the bottom of an E shape sound distinctly different than the two or three open strings in the middle of a G shape. On the other hand, the D shape has three fretted strings at the top and is often played with the bottom two strings muted. All of this goes out the window when someone starts playing in an open tuning. There tend to be a lot more open strings, and even a trained ear can be very confused. Maybe you will hear two chords that obviously have the same three open strings, but the bottom two strings have moved up two frets, and you think, ""WTF. There aren't two chords that fit together that way!"" Not in standard tuning, there aren't... EDIT TO ADD: Another example of this is the common modifications to chord shapes. You'll commonly hear a sus4 alteration of a G or a D shape, but you'll seldom hear it for an E shape because the fingering is very awkward. In an alternate tuning, you may hear a sus4 alteration and be misled into which chord the guitarist is playing.  Another thing that makes music like this harder to interpret is that the players often use chord inversions or substituted root notes to move the bass line around; the guitar is used in a rhythm context and fills the place that a bass guitar would carry, if there were one. So quite often, it will sound like a chord is changing, but in fact it hasn't. The guitarist has changed the shape of the chord they are playing, but it's the same chord, in a different inversion or with a different bass note. This can be maddening when reading fake books, because the book will say that there are four measures of the same chord, but you can hear that the progression is definitely moving.  EDIT: One more confusing thing is that traditional music will often use pedal tones or droning notes. This derives, I think, from the pipes, which have drones. The song may maintain the drone notes even if they don't fit into the current chord being played in a usual way. The chord progression continues to move while the drone notes (almost always one or more open strings) ring. This can be confusing because you may try to fit the open strings into the chord being played, but they don't.  If you want to learn to play traditional music, the single best way is to learn the way traditional music has been learned for centuries: find other people who play it and learn from them. Find a session in your town if at all possible, and go, have a drink, and meet the other players. Find out if there are informal sessions that you could start going to. Watch the guitarist's hands and see what he or she is doing. Etc... If you were talking about a lead-style instrument like violin, then I think it would be much easier to learn by picking up melodies by ear. For an instrument like guitar, I think the combination of tunings and fingerings is just so open-ended that it's going to be hard to do it without learning in person from someone who knows."
musictheory,3co9ee,xiMbd03u1,4,Thu Jul 9 14:27:35 2015 UTC,"Although the gist of my comment turned out to be ""why interpreting Celtic music by ear can be difficult,"" I hope I've also outlined some of the ways that you can begin to interpret music by ear for the guitar. Listen for the harmonically richer sound of open strings vs. the sound of fretted strings. Pay attention to which strings are open. You don't need to be able to tell a G string from an e string by ear. Just listen to the downstroke and the strings will sound in order. Try to pay attention to all of the instruments for cues as to when a chord change has happened vs. a moving bass line over the same chord. It can often sound like there are far more chord changes occuring than there really are. Listen for common alterations such as the sus4 to give clues to which chord shape is being played--but be aware that this is less useful in Traditional music because such alterations are less common, and moving chord inversions, bass-lines, or outlining the melody, are seen instead."
musictheory,3co9ee,xiMbd03u1,3,Thu Jul 9 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"Here's another tip. Using triads and chord inversions to play melody and chord at the same time. This guy isn't specifically playing Celtic music, but the idea of outlining the melody or bass line while playing the chords is prominent in session music.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1F59iNRomQ  This is where some of the interesting busy-ness that you like is coming from. The lower strings (E, A, possibly D) will be outlining the melody or bass line while the upper strings (D, G, B, e) will be outlining the chord."
musictheory,3co9ee,xiMbd03u1,2,Thu Jul 9 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"My buddy just recently told me about this website called chordify.net that supposedly takes YouTube links and gives you the chord sequences. I haven't tested it out, so if you give it a go, please let me know how it is!!  Also, for guitar specifically, I usually just listen to the highest string (usually the most prominent for me), and slowly break down what the chords could be, based off of that one note. Hope this helps."
musictheory,3co9ee,el_memador,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:18:21 2015 UTC,"I'll emphasize on the point of droning notes. For this particular song, we have the top G which is staying on pretty much all chords.  If you tune your guitar to some open tuning with the root on top - let's say E-B-E-G#-B-E, with a capo on the 3rd fret - then you should be able to get this sound fairly easily. Try these voicings for example:  G5   --0-- --0-- --3-- --0-- --0-- --0--  Cmaj7   --0-- --2-- --0-- --0-- --x-- --5--  Dadd11   --0-- --4-- --3-- --2-- --0-- --x--  Em   --0-- --2-- --0-- --0-- --2-- -(0)-  Am7  --0-- --2-- --1-- --2-- --x-- --2--   An easy way to get more movement is to just add small ornaments to each chord (like adding a 7 to the Em or a 6 or 9 to the C and G). For some chords it's also really easy to change the bass note (G/B and C/E). Experiment a bit and you should be able to find something that sounds okay with the tune! To find the exact voicings used by the guitarist in the recording is a lot more work."
musictheory,3co9ee,Ab-7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:58:51 2015 UTC,"I appreciate you elaborating on this. The high strings are most useful in ear-interpretation because they ring more clearly and stand out more distinctly than the low strings. When the top strings play the same notes for every chord, and the bottom strings are often not playing the root of the note, it's pretty much a worst-case scenario for ear-interpretation. You're more or less in a scenario of transcribing note-for-note instead of using any shortcuts."
musictheory,3co9ee,xiMbd03u1,7,Fri Jul 10 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"Your advice is incomplete at best because it ignores the voicing of the chord, which as you surely know, is used to create movement in the bass or melody line. If you give me a fake-book for a British Isles song, I won't sound anything like the band that's playing it, because I'm going to play all open chords in the 1st inversion, and that's seldom what they're playing (in my experience, anyway).   Also, telling a complete n00b that ""minor chords sound sad"" is useless. Minor chords don't sound sad. They sound minor. Once you already know how to identify minor chords, you can say, ""Oh yeah, all minor chords sound sad,"" but that's only because you already know they're minor."

If someone needs 30 years of experience to follow your ONE SIMPLE STEP FOR INTERPRETING CELTIC MUSIC--SESSION PLAYERS HATE HIM then it's not the right advice to give to someone who is obviously just starting out, as OP is.  OP asked how to play the song in the video, and specifically referenced its complexity. You answered, ""find the root and the third and that's all there is to it."" You did not answer OP's question at all.   Also, minor chords do sound sad   That article says that minor songs tend to sound sad, not minor chords. And it also points out that there are many exceptions. The advice, ""If it sounds sad, it's minor,"" is no help at all when doing ear transcription. If you want to identify minor chords, you just have to learn to hear the flat third.  This is the last thing that I will have to say on the topic."

musictheory,3cmoim,chunter16,33,Thu Jul 9 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the things you're missing out on if you only know one key:  Modulation: It's a really cool effect, and full use of it can only be achieved when you know every key.  Arranging for different instruments: Some instruments can only play easily in a few keys, or transpose by default.  Playing with others: If someone else wrote a song in a key you don't know, then you can't play along well. How you gonna jam?  Developing musicianship: Learning in different keys forces you to grow as a musician, just as learning anything does.  Writing: When you noodle around, your hand naturally wants to do certain things based on what's comfortable and what you've played before, if you play in different keys, what's comfortable and what you've done before changes, so learning different keys does indeed help you come across new ideas.  Those are just a few things I could think of."
musictheory,3cmoim,FuzzyCheese,11,Thu Jul 9 03:03:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with all this, but also depending on the instrument (usually voices) range can come into account. If you want your last chord to be relatively high up (all the voices) you may not choose E major because that would be a real stretch for the bass voice to get up to an E on the treble clef. The only other option is to move the E in the bass down an octave but then it's muchh lower. You could choose Maybe C major because middle C is within the comfortable range. This usually isn't really an issue unless you wanted that specific chord quality like the example but may be something you decide later on in the writing. Sibelius has a quick way to transpose to different keys so that makes it quick and easy."
musictheory,3cmoim,dylanthepiguy2,2,Thu Jul 9 07:13:39 2015 UTC,I've heard the reason many of Mozart's works were in D was that strings sound brilliant in it (because of overtones?)
musictheory,3cmoim,Pejorativez,2,Thu Jul 9 08:17:52 2015 UTC,D was the key of glory for this reason I think. G also works well for the same reason
musictheory,3cmoim,dylanthepiguy2,2,Thu Jul 9 11:00:37 2015 UTC,"Overtones might play into it a bit, but I think it's probably more to do with what notes are available/unavailable to be played on open strings, in addition to the way notes of that key vibrate sympathetically with the open strings.   Mozart also loved the key of D in a lot of works, not just for string writing."
musictheory,3cmoim,nmitchell076,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:54:59 2015 UTC,in addition to the way notes of that key vibrate sympathetically with the open strings.    Can you elaborate on this?
musictheory,3cmoim,Pejorativez,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:06 2015 UTC,"I remember when bored in a practice room with a piano, I would often hold down a piano pedal and sing or play (with another instrument) into the strings. If you do this, you'll notice that the piano strings will ""pick up"" on the note you sing or play, the strings that produce similar sounds to the notes that you're playing will start vibrating, creating a cool little resonance effect. If you touch the piano strings on the inside of the piano, you'll actually feel that some of the strings have started vibrating, while others haven't. If I play a C into the piano with a trumpet, then feel the strings inside, I'll notice that several of the C strings are vibrating pretty hard, several of the Gs less so, and strings like F# or Eb probably not at all.   This is what sympathetic resonance refers to. The ability of nearby objects that can vibrate to ""pick up"" on the notes you are producing. Things will vibrate more the more in synch it is with the overtones of what you are producing.   So let's say I'm playing a violin piece, and there's a low D acting as a tonic. I could play this on the open D string, which will produce some sympathetic resonances with the A string above it. But I can't really ""juice"" an open string with vibrato, can I? So what if I play it on the G string instead? Well, now I can get some vibrato in there if I want it, but also, you'll notice that the open D string that you aren't actually bowing is also vibrating a little bit since you are playing the same pitch below. And the A above it is still providing a bit of sympathetic vibration as well. So you have a bit more of a richly colored note there.   Of course, the effects are pretty slight, and I doubt Mozart was thinking too hard about sympathetic resonance when he was writing. But he absolutely would have been thinking about how the key feels under the fingers. Every open string on the violin is diatonic to the key of D. Every open string has a whole note above it in the diatonic collection (as opposed to, say, C, which has a half step above the highest open string), and certain structural pitches are positioned in such a way that they can be realized more flexibly (for instance you can have lower neighbors to your lowest scale degree 5, which isn't available in C; you also have the option of realizing your lowest tonic as either open or stopped, which isn't possible in any other key, etc.). The violin is just ""at home"" in D major, it's a very idiomatic key for that instrument. It feels very nice under the fingers (which is probably most important), while also sounding nice due to sympathetic resonance and timbral nuances (which is important, but less so than physical feel, I'd say)."

Most modern PA systems at rock and electronic music concerts will have a sweet spot in the bass response between 36-49Hz (D1-G1).

I would (hopefully) never have a Bb trumpet play in B major, I'd want it in Bb, Eb, F, etc. not because it's easier, but because it's in tune more often and better for the performer. In the case of Cm, it's a good key but if you limit yourself to just that, you won't know what other tambours your instrument can make.   Really it comes down to playability and intonation."

For example, high notes on the flute are very piercing while low notes are very subdued. To create some variation so that your songs aren't all in the same key which becomes obvious if they are played consecutively. To make certain features possible on certain instruments (chords/double stops/open strings on stringed instruments.  Slides on trombone, etc.) If you only write in one key that means you are never modulating and the tonal center of all your music is always stagnant. If writing for beginning/intermediate ensembles, some keys are more difficult than others on certain instruments.  Also, some keys are more difficult to read on all instruments.

musictheory,3co1u6,setecordas,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think perhaps ""thematic transformation"" is the best term for this. Here is some of what Grove has to say about this concept:   [Thematic transformation is] a term used to define the process of modifying a theme so that in a new context it is different but yet manifestly made of the same elements; a variant term is ‘thematic metamorphosis’. With...the desire for continuity between movements, the process became a favourite method in 19th-century music of giving greater cohesion both between and within separate movements of multi-movement works. It was also widely used in opera. Great ingenuity was devoted to changing the rhythm, melodic detail, orchestration or dynamic character of a theme to adapt it to a different purpose, often for programmatic reasons. Thematic transformation is no more than a special application of the principle of variation; yet although the technique is similar the effect is usually different, since the transformed theme has a life and independence of its own and is no longer a sibling of the original theme....Thematic transformation belongs above all to the 19th century, when composers exploited through it the possibilities that arose from giving themes dramatic or human significance in instrumental or vocal music....The practice of thematic transformation is particularly associated with Liszt, who applied it as a thoroughgoing source of musical development....Such processes became a regular part of later 19th-century music, especially in the hands of Liszt's followers....Perhaps the most far-reaching application of thematic transformation occurred in Wagner’s treatment of the Leitmotif, for the motifs, especially in the Ring, are combined, adapted, extended and altered in shape, rhythm and colour to reflect the dramatic action at all points...[and] many of Wagner's motifs stand in relationships to each other that gradually become clear during the course of a work and in which transformation merges with symphonic development....While the naive type of transformation (turning a joyful melody into a sad one by putting it into the minor, for example) lost favour in the 20th century, more sophisticated types, combined with more general thematic development, are to be found in music of all kinds, particularly that which accepts wholeheartedly the symphonic heritage of the past. [In this category, I would include classic Hollywood film music.]"

Cinderella's Big Score, basically throughout, though particularly in the pre-verse breaks and the bridge after the first set of lyrics.

musictheory,3cl3vv,arsan_sa,7,Wed Jul 8 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"tUnE-yArDs – gangsta  tl;dr - two keys at once in the choruses  This is an example of a song using ""bi-tonality"" – two keys at the same time – as a means of creating dissonance.  Admittedly, the verses of this song are NOT notably dissonance. The only harsh dissonance during the verse is in the line, ""If you move into his neighborhood he'll never make a SOUND"" (0:54). The word ""SOUND"" is on the flat-second (b2) scale degree – in this case, an accented E in E-flat major.  But that's not what I came here to talk about! The bass shifts to B major in the choruses, while the vocals and saxes remain in E-flat, switching to the minor mode for the choruses.  Why does it work? Probably because B major and E-flat minor share all but one note. (The scale degree ""E"" in B major and ""F"" in E-flat minor are, in this case, unique to their scale.)  The bass slams down on an E at the start of the choruses (1:18), making the juxtaposition between the two keys quickly apparent. It's also worth mentioning that the last note of the bass line during the choruses is the pedal that the bass stays on through the bridges – the A-sharp in B major becomes the B-flat pedal (1:36).  It's been a while since I've written about theory, I hope that made sense.  P.S.: The bi-tonal trick happens in her song Water Fountain too, though it's less obvious and much shorter. The song starts in D-flat major, but modulates to F major (2:02). Pay attention at 2:38 – it's the ending that uses both keys at once."

musictheory,3cl3vv,LarryLarington,2,Thu Jul 9 04:01:32 2015 UTC,"The Tristan chord is just a min7b5 that doesn't resolve conventionally. I absolutely agree that it was a huge milestone in music history, but I don't think it's as mystical as everyone likes to say it is."
musictheory,3cl3vv,baseballfan3030,4,Thu Jul 9 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"Here's the difference- context. I once wrote a stacked 13 chord, and a much more jazz-centric friend of mine explained, ""You wouldn't write the 11, because it's just a sus4."" In classical music, you would have to write it as an 11, because a sus4 would change the chord and (most likely) the voice leading. Similar thing here, there is a gap between the classical and jazz ways of doing things. Furthermore, how a chord is spelled on paper won't convey the mystical-ness that comes from hearing it played by a full orchestra. Just because it looks simple on paper, does not make it ordinary or overrated."
musictheory,3cl3vv,1130PM-Advisor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, I'm not denying that it wasn't revolutionary. It changed the concept of how dissonance should be handled and resolved. The way it's orchestrated makes it beautiful, too. But if you take it out of context and play the ""Tristan chord"" I would say no, you're just playing a half-diminished 7 chord."
musictheory,3cl3vv,baseballfan3030,2,Thu Jul 9 13:51:11 2015 UTC,"There's a saying I heard a couple years ago, and I find it especially relevant here: ""There is no such thing as a wrong note, but only a wrong place to put it.""  Essentially what that says is that context is everything. Sure you can hear the Tristan chord as a half-diminished 7th chord, but that is NOT its function. In A minor the Tristan chord would be a bvi half-diminished 7th, but it definitively resolves to a V rather its more typical functions as a pivot iio/7-V or a secondary viio/7-I.  Taking into account the chord's unusual spelling (it isn't spelled as a half-diminished 7th chord), I would say that the Tristan chord is functioning as a pre-dominant chord that chormatically resolves to a V. The context here is so important in understanding the chord's significance.  By your statement, you're looking for a moment of dissonance that can stand alone and be judged on its own construction. There's a slight fault in that view -- you can't have dissonance without consonance. You need a piece to define its harmonic/pitch language for you to assess the push and pull of tension and release.   And pieces can define consonance and dissonance differently. A cadence in Bartok is much different from a cadence in Beethoven. Not acknowledging the composer, genre, time period, harmonic language, etc, everything relevant to the occurrence of a specific moment of dissonance deprives yourself of a complete understanding of the significance of such a moment."

That add6, I'm not sure how to notate the suspension properly for this one, but the dissonant note which is a C (the supertonic) is held over the first two chords before going to a Bb. The Bb in the first chord is dissonant with the A and the C - there's two major seconds so when you write out the chord it looks really funny! But still is heard (to me) as a cadential 6/4."

Tarrega uses it in his Recuerdos de la Alhambra (in Am) -- he ends one phrase with a G#, on an E7 chord, and begins the next with a Bb, on an A7 chord (well, A7b9).  It's a really great example of a very uncommon interval, so you really get two dissonances -- the unsettling dissonance in the melody, from the G# to the Bb, and the urgent dissonance in the harmony, with the A and Bb making a minor 9th.  Both are resolved when the Bb goes down to A.  The reason why this is so great is because the passage leading up to the G# is really sweet and ends on a V chord, so you're expecting a normal resolution, but what you get is this very, very emotionally charged minor 9th instead, and the moment has moved on.  The only resolution you get there is actually to the iv, which isn't much of a resolution at all!"

musictheory,3clmra,Cdesese,5,Thu Jul 9 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that this is more like polymeter than polyrhythm, but I suppose that's just a question of scale (maybe meter is just large-scale rhythm?).  Hemiola is probably best defined strictly as the metrical phenomenon that you typically find in the drive to an important cadence in much baroque and some classical music, in which the prevailing triple meter momentarily shifts to duple meter. Sometimes in a hemiola there is a metrical layer in the texture that maintains the triple meter, creating, for a moment, a 2-against-3 polyrhythm/meter.  I wouldn't call the mere use of ""tuplet"" rhythms (triplets, quintuplets, septuplets, etc.) polyrhythm. There has to be a sense that two or more contradictory rhythmic layers are being superimposed (i.e., triplets against duplets, quintuplets against triplets) for it to be polyrhythm/meter."

Called polyrhythm - it can get tricky to notate (especially in more complex examples like 7 against 5) but the convention is to pick one time signature and stick with it. So your way of writing it in 4/4 is the way to go. That's not to say it's the only way! Phillip Glass does it by having two time signatures at the same time - but can be hard to read.

musictheory,3cm65a,mdonova33,11,Thu Jul 9 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"/u/Cdesese gave a pretty good explanation, but I thought I would add my own thought process. Again, with the key of C, write out the scale:  C D E F G A B   Then, whatever chord you want, start from that note, take every other not in the sequence, and you have a chord. So say you want F. You get F A C. If you want D, you go D F A. But then you realize it sounds minor... well it is. So is EGB. and ACE. But CEG, FAC, and GBD are all major. BDF is diminished.   Then try that in another key. Say the key of G for example.   G A B C D E F#   GBD is major. ACE, BDF# and EGB are minor. CEG and DF#A are major and F#AC is diminished. This pattern holds true for every major key. We use a number system for this, roman numerals. You have probably seen it used before.  I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii dim  The capital roman numerals mean major and the lower case mean minor. You can memorize this pattern very easily (major, minor, minor, major, major, minor, diminished). Then if you know how to spell the scale, you can know every single diatonic chord in every single key.  This also works for seventh chords. Just keep using every other note in the scale. This time let's try D major.  D E F# G A B C#  The first chord - D F# A C#. That's a major7.  EGBD? That's a minor7. AC#EG? That's a dominant 7 (or just 7). So you have a new pattern you can memorize:  M7, m7, m7, M7, 7, m7, m7b5  So what it all comes down to is knowing what notes are in each key. To learn that, you should study the circle of fifths. I won't go into that because this post is already tons longer than I thought it would be.  Hope this helps!"
musictheory,3cm65a,reydeguitarra,3,Thu Jul 9 02:48:44 2015 UTC,Dude this is so helpful thank you so much. I've always wondered how people can find the key so easily and now I can myself! Thanks again

musictheory,3cm65a,Cdesese,6,Fri Jul 10 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"A chord is considered part of a key if all of its notes are notes that appear in the scale of that key.  So here are the notes in a C major scale: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. Any chords made up of only these notes will be chords that are part of C major.  The easiest way to figure out what all the chords are is to write out the notes of the scale and then build the triad and seventh chord on each note, only using the notes in the scale of the key. For C major, this process would look like this:    C D E F G A B    E F G A B C D   G A B C D E F    The notes in each column form all of the triads in C major: C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished. This is what it would look like for seventh chords in C major:    C D E F G A B    E F G A B C D   G A B C D E F   B C D E F G A    Looking at each column, we see that the seventh chords in C major are CM7, Dm7, Em7, FM7, Gdom7, Am7, and Bhalf-dim7."

musictheory,3cp4sn,pHpositivo,10,Thu Jul 9 17:21:39 2015 UTC,"First off, I feel this is a leading question. Maybe I'm just sensative to genre snobbery, but I get a faint hint of that here. That aside, maybe I can address some of your questions. I think about musical accessability a lot, as someone who's wept manly tears to the ending of A Viscious Reforming of Features and Goddess Gagged.   I know you're using an instrumental track to account for difference in taste regarding singing vs. screaming, but to address your actual question, Vocals can play a big part in accessability. And just like screaming vs singing creates a ""type"" of vocal, so to are there differences between Cabaret vocals, Disco, Classic and New rock etc. You'll find a lot of people don't like Dubstep, but DO like some Dance genre or another, whether it be dancehall, house, or straight EDM. People like what they like, and as a would be producer, I indulge in all of these genres (mostly Nu Disco, House and dub Ska atm). But they all have a different Mode and culture attached to them. including instrumentalism.  Culture is another huge point to consider, and arguably the greatest contributor to tastes. Less musically inclined people get there music from somewhere. And for the average person, that's most likely to be in public, through popular media (Skrills did the soundtrack for Transformers iirc), the radio, or the club.   This point is doubly enforced in that while they are being exposed to EDM (or rock or w.e), they are selectively not being exposed to Prog or Metal, or Free Jazz, or South American Tribal fusion. An experiment in ear training found that exposure to music creates an ear for the genre. In Prog, that means identifying arpeggios, extended chords, fast leads and such. The study concluded that unfamiliar participants were unable to identify or appreciate many common tropes in the genre.   Another factor in accessability is complexity. Multiple time signatures, compound meters and ostinatti are not accessable to the lamen music listener. As groovy as they may be.   I would also like to note that there is still a plethora of complexity in EDM, even theoretical complexity. I've heard Nero use unique scales like Neapolitan minor in his tunes. I've seen DeadMau5 layer synths with delay to create multiple voicings and attack/ release control. Really every major track is relying on the abuse of some standard form of practice. But the real meat and potatos for these genres are in spectral representation. I'm talking full spectrum basses that require a 2.1 system to be heard properly. Just like guitar players have feeling in their fingers, Dance tracks have a literal feeling in the spectrum which to the common listener elicits a very real emotional reaction. As real as the feeling you have when you hear Tosin bang out a gorgeous arpeggiated chord into a pop and slap octive trill.   If you're pondering questions like these, I think you're on the right track. but I would suggest changing your orientation away from ""why them and not this"", into ""Why are people attracted to this, and what can I do to make my music more accessable?""  Cheers!"
musictheory,3cp4sn,k1o,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:18:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer man, I had a good time reading it. Yeah, there could be a bit of genre snobbery here on my end, but I can assure you that I opened this post because I was actually interested in hearing some opinions, and not just to prove my point.  I know that a lot of people like some random songs from different genres, what I was wondering is why some just seem to reject every kind of song from a particular genre. As you said, one could dislike dubstep, but could appreciate a specific dance/EDM song, and that's fine. Then why is it that when I tried to play 10 different progressive metal songs in front of a few friends of mine, they couldn't stand even a single song? It just seems like they have some form of prejudice towards certain genres, so they instinctively say they dislike the song without giving it a chance to impress them.  The part about that study you're talking about is actually really interesting, and I have to say it worked for me. When I first started listening to this genre, I could just appreciate a few songs, then as I kept listening to it I got used to its particular sound and now I can listen and enjoy tracks that a few years ago would have just made me go away. Still, I don't understand why most just can't stand to listen even 30 seconds of a song. You can't get any emotions in the first 3 seconds, and if you stop there, of course you'll keep thinking that the song was bad.  I can say that my favorite genre is progressive metal, but I also listen to electronic music, pop, downtempo, rock (and many subgenres), rap and others without problems. What I want to say is that I don't like throwing away opportunities to find a track I might enjoy, so I'm opened to every possible genre.  When I talk to other people though, the sverage conversation will go like this:  me: ""What music do you listen to?"" guy: ""Oh, I listen to everything, no problems"" me: ""Do you like progressive metal, ever heard of it?"" guy: ""Oh, no, I hate metal""  The two sentences are incoherent, but other than that, why is it that so many have just some form of prejudice towards a certain genre?  Yeah, as you said, there are other genres that are compex as well (even though, other than Jazz and Classical music, they are not as difficult to play as progressive metal tracks), like EDM and others, but people like them anyway. I started to think that it's just something with the particular sound, I mean, it's like just the sound of a double kick, or a distorted, palm-muted guitar just scares most people away.  And another thing I just don't get: I can say that I like progressive metal, but I can admit that other genres like Jazz, classical music and others are difficult to play and are good as well. So why is it that I always hear people saying that this genre is just a mess? That's just plain stupid. Is it so hard for people to admit they're just ignorant and that they simply don't get the song structure? Think about this: I could say that I find a particular jazz fusion song quite messy, but I'd be really presumptuous if I said that the song just didn't have a structure. I could still say that I find it messy, but I'd admit with no problems that the song is still perfectly valid and well written, even if I don't manage to get it.  Sorry if I made some mistakes, English is not my first language and I just wrote all this top from the top of my head without checking it :)  Cheers!"
musictheory,3cp4sn,nevetskl,6,Fri Jul 10 16:25:03 2015 UTC,"Skrillex has catchy melodic hooks, pop song structure, and a very prominent beat you can dance to. Progressive metal... not so much. This is coming from someone who enjoys progressive rock and metal."
musictheory,3cp4sn,nevetskl,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:22 2015 UTC,I imagine a lot of popular electronic artists also keep most of their songs in 4/4 like most pop songs. 4/4 is probably the most natural time signature and is easy to follow and move too.

Why not to listen to another genre then? Also, there are a lot of prog metal songs in 4/4, but I'm not sure that's the main problem for most people. Also, I don't thing it's the number of different signatures that bothers most, CAFO by AAL for example the same time signature for the whole song (9/4), but I have yet to find a pop/rock/commercial music guy who will like that masterpiece."
musictheory,3cp4sn,TNUGS,3,Thu Jul 9 18:02:16 2015 UTC,"but I don't see the point of listening to a ""song you can dance to"" while you're in a car, or at home.   The problem is not that they literally can't dance to it, as you said, they're often listening to music in situations where dancing isn't possible or an option, rather, it's the implication of a song being easy to dance to that matters: the implication being that songs that are easy to dance to are songs that are easy to get.  I can dance to NIN's March of the Pigs which is in 29/8, but that's because I GET the song. The average music listener couldn't even count along with the beat let alone dance to it. Weird time signatures are too difficult for most people because they're forced to count to numbers higher than 2 or 3.  But even aside from that, it's also an issue of timbre/arrangement. A lot of people don't like the sound of metal for whatever reason. Maybe they find it cheesy, maybe they find it passé, or maybe they just find it really limiting. I don't listen to metal because of this very reason; it's not too complex (I already listen to pop music as complex and classical music much more complex), it's just too limiting and I feel like I've already heard everything the genre has to offer. Rock bands like Radiohead, NIN and Broadcast are MUCH more interesting from a sonic perspective."
musictheory,3cp4sn,nevetskl,2,Thu Jul 9 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"It's so much timbre imo.  I like metal, but there is such a thing as too much distortion.  Hint-if you can't tell if you're listening to a guitar or an underwater lawnmower, there's too much distortion."
musictheory,3cp4sn,OpinionGenerator,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, timbre is also a very important thing. There are people who don't like certain songs just because of how a singer sounds. The same can be applied to the instrumentation of metal, the harshness of the highly distorted guitars, and aggressiveness of the drums.   It really just gets down to the personal preference of the listener. Someone might listen to Animals as Leaders and think ""Wow thats a lot of sweep picking, thats super cool"" and another might think ""what the fuck is this noise?""."
musictheory,3cp4sn,setecordas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with the ""songs that are easy to dance are easy to get"" part, but I also think that if people just took a minute of their time to actually listen to a song they could eventually get it.  As for the timbre... I don't know, I don't get the ""I know everything metal has to offer"" sentence. How could you say that, when metal has hundreds of subgenres? Here I'm talking about Progressive Metal (or Djent if you consider groups like Animals as Leaders, Periphery, Tesseract, Monuments...), but there are a lot of other subgenres, how can you be so sure you know everything the whole metal genre has to offer? I mean, I personally don't like some of them (I can't stand death metal for example), but there are just too many genres and I don't know how can someone group them together as just ""metal"". In my opinion, Progressive Metal is an entirely different thing than all the other subgenres, and of course the whole discussion is valid for other subgenres as well though."
musictheory,3cp4sn,tanksforthegold,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:53 2015 UTC,"but I also think that if people just took a minute of their time to actually listen to a song they could eventually get it.   Sure, but that requires work and most people are lazy.   I don't know, I don't get the ""I know everything metal has to offer"" sentence. How could you say that, when metal has hundreds of subgenres?   All genres have a ton of subgenres. Metal just varies a lot less than the EDM scene or general rock scene.   how can you be so sure you know everything the whole metal genre has to offer?   Well if you're going to throw the word ""know"" in there, I can't. But how can you be so sure you ""know"" there aren't leprechauns? Outside of maths though, people generally don't operate based upon deductive reasoning, they use inductive reasoning (i.e., reasoning based upon probability, not on absolute knowledge or certainty).  This is grasping at straws though. MAYBE there's some metal song out there that will sound substantially different, but so far, that hasn't been the case for me in, literally, decades so why would I bother with a genre with so few of these kinds of tracks when there are specific BANDS, let alone GENRES, that offer this kind of thing on a regular basis that don't require me to hunt forever?  MAYBE there's a shit sandwich out there that will strike your fancy, but why waste time looking for that when non-shit sandwiches get the job done with much more consistency?"

Since I went to a liberal arts school, the level of the aural skills classes was fairly low, and I came in being able to test out of them.  But they didn't let me, and made me actually take them.  Both semesters I ended up only going to a few classes, saying screw this, and showing up and passing the final.  But both times, even though those professors had very different approaches, they were terrible.  The first semester the professor just sat there with Hindemith's ear training textbook and went through each exercise one by one calling on random volunteers to either sing, play, etc.  Since it was a co-req to intro theory, half the class were non-majors that couldn't sing or play piano. So that was painful.  Second semester the professor was completely focused on recognizing chords, so all we did every singe class was she would play a chord and have someone guess, go around in a circle, all class. Nothing else ever.   I wish we had had separate classes for majors and non-majors, but at such a small school sadly that wasn't possible."

First day will pull out the book and start sight singing, everyone in my class knew what to do as they had been in band and music classes since middle school. I had never read music, I thought I was screwed and wondered what I had got myself into. The class moved really fast too. We would sing everyday, and get a grade on rhythm or singing. I never sang, Im a guitar player, this class was brutal. I stuck with it and had some embarrassing times in class but I pass aural I and II. I hated my teacher but I learned to like him as I slowly understood hes methods. I'll be starting aural III this semester with a new teacher who happens to be my guitar instructor and advisor.

Aural skills have always come pretty easily to me, but this professor had a way of making things challenging for skilled students. He also went into depth with sonorities, talking about their ""mood,"" different ways to identify them, how they're used, and what his favorite one was. (V4/2. Actually, V4/2 of IV. I can't remember why. He just couldn't keep himself from smiling when he played it.) He used words like ""whole tone-ish"" for Fr+6, ""octatonic feeling"" for fully diminished 7th, and ""high school jazz"" for ii7. His descriptions didn't always make sense, but they helped his students remember.    He was also an excellent pianist (which is a great skill to have always).    He was also goofy, and very aware of it. In other words, he was comfortable with himself and not afraid to be himself. But he knew how to stay on task. One thing that repelled me from the first 3 professors was that they were easily distracted, or they weren't able to make their point quickly (which wasted a lot of time). I always felt like professor #4 packed 2 or 3 times as much content into the hour as the other profs."

I would say the most important factor is to find a teacher who is willing to cater to each student individually. Ear training is learned differently by different people. Having a professor who is able to demonstrate and assist you with many different approaches is the best way to go about it."

musictheory,3clc3i,Cdesese,2,Wed Jul 8 20:36:18 2015 UTC,"And I've seen parts written like that. I've only seen it with very short sections - obviously this notation wouldn't work with page turns - but I have seen it done.  If each section is like 4 bars, I've seen them all on their own lines, clearly marked. Then at the top of the sheet, the composer would put something like ""Head: AAAABBCCCC, Solos: AABB, Open drum solo over C."""
musictheory,3clc3i,totestoro,2,Thu Jul 9 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"If you're totally determined not to write the same part out more than once, you could write out A with 3 endings. First ending gets a repeat, joint second and forth ending gets no repeat and moves on to section B, with a DC al Coda at the end of B. 3rd ending goes to the Coda, C. End of the Coda has a DC al Fine with a fine written at the end of B.  Expect confusion.  Alternately, you could use a copy paste function to just write out the form."
musictheory,3clc3i,notgarysmulyan,2,Wed Jul 8 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see how it would be confusing.  Make the C section the coda, and it will look like this  A (repeat sign/coda symbol) B (D.C. al Coda/Fine) C (D.C al Fine)  As played, it would be A, A (because of the repeat sign), B, A (because of the D.C.*), C (the coda), A B (because of the D.C.).  since repeats are ignored when following a D.C. or D.S. unless otherwise marked, that gives you AABACAB"

musictheory,3clc3i,yackiesoba,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:43 2015 UTC,"Short answer is no. You can save space vertically by combining similar parts (the woodwind section to pick an example) onto their own staff line or have every part smooshed onto a grand staff instead having an individual line of music for each part.    Also, DCs DSs can help more than you might think! The most compact/paper saving way I can think of organizing your example is if you have repeats around the first A section with instructions to only take the repeat the first time through. Then a D.C. al Fine after the 2nd B and the Fine written after the first B (to be read after the D.C.)"

musictheory,3cgj8u,sanityvampire,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"Bb major implies that the ""home"" or tonic is Bb. That means that certain tendency tones will want to resolve to the tonic, or Bb. The I chord (home chord) is Bb major ( Bb-D-F). Bb major has a key signature of 2 flats: Bb and Eb. G minor shares those two flats but if the key is G minor, a G minor is the tonic or ""home"" chord. Same collection of pitches (Bb, C, D, Eb, F, G, A) same key signature (Bb and Eb) just a different ""home."""

musictheory,3cgj8u,dentree2,11,Tue Jul 7 23:48:19 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from but you seem to be overthinking this a bit. It would certainly be more common to refer to these notes as a maj7#11. However, you specifically said ""How can a Maj7th have a b5.... Maj7th is 1,3,5,7. Can't have both 5 and b5"" which is confusing the matter.  You absolutely can augment or diminish the 5th of a chord if you want, and that's exactly what apostate indicated when he said ""Major 7th with a flat fifth"" (i.e. maj7b5). A standard maj7 chord can't have a b5, but a maj7b5 will have a b5 by definition. Granted, a maj7b5 is irregular because of the much more common #11, but you will for example see altered 5ths being applied in the form of the augmented major 7th chord (maj7#5). Anyway, apostate's suggested chord is not wrong, and while it is almost the same, there is some difference in the implied notes:  Cmaj7#11 would be C - E - G - B - F#  Cmaj7b5 would be C - E - Gb - B"
musictheory,3cgj8u,Mikep98,0,Wed Jul 8 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"Good point.   but you will for example see altered 5ths being applied in the form of the augmented major 7th chord (maj7#5).   Which comes up in the Harmonic minor harmonisation. Making it ""proper"", if we take harmonisation to be the thing which is a foundation for us to choose saying #4 vrs b5.  I've given my copy to a cousin so can't look them up but I imagine this all goes out the window a little with something like Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organisation where you're harmonising many different scales to begin with."

musictheory,3cgj8u,kidbeer,0,Wed Jul 8 03:51:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not overly formal but will throw out how I understand it.  Said like that, but with #4 instead of b5, maybe some would call it aug4 for ""augmented"" or raised 4th.  A flat 5 you'd probably call ""diminished"", from Major scale harmonisation you get a ""half-diminished"" min7b5 chord. Your Major type (3) and natural 7th fly in the face of that though, suggesting it must be a 4 unless it comes from some other harmonisation.... I don't know my Harmonic minor harmonisation too well, google tells me, 1-b3-b-7 (min/Maj7), 1-b3-b5-b7 (half-diminished, min7b5, circle with line), 1-3-#5-7 (aug5, Maj7#5), 1-b3-5-b7 (min7), 1-3-5-b7 (dom7), 1-3-5-7 (Maj7), 1-b3-b5-bb7 (fully-diminished, full circle)... nothing Major with a 7 and b5 showing up there...   I'd probably look at the same chord and see 1,3,5,7,#11. Figure it still probably has the 5th, even if you're not playing it. Especially if you see it as a Major chord rather than Diminished."
musictheory,3cgj8u,phearsom_fysic,3,Wed Jul 8 02:14:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you're partly right, and partly wrong. You're right that flattening the fifth gives a chord a more diminished sound, but without a minor third you'd be hard-pressed to call it an actual diminished chord. You're also right to say that notes may be omitted from a chord but still part of the chord's function, but that is definitely not the case for an unaltered scale-degree when an altered note on the same scale degree exists in that chord.  The formal name for a chord that's built 1-3-b5 is simply a b5 chord (unless 1 is not the actual root, in which case it's likely a m6 built on the 6), add a maj7 to that, and you've got yourself a maj7b5 chord (or m6/9 built on the 6). Only if the natural fifth is included would we call it a maj7#11, and that comes loaded with some voicing assumptions (that the b5 will be voiced above the 7)."

On the plus side, thinking of it your way is a nice way to find different uses for your chords. Like, say you've got an Em7 chord in the key of C, if you treat it as a G/E, then it could have a dominant function rather than whatever function your mediant chord would have served (usually a modulated tonic). Extend in the other direction and you've got yourself a C9 chord for use as a tonic, but it's still got that Em and G in there, so you could take it in all. Take it one step further, to an Am11 chord and you've got a chord that contains subdominant, tonic, mediant, and dominant triads all at once, so you can go anywhere with it."

musictheory,3cidkk,philosopher_b,3,Wed Jul 8 03:35:57 2015 UTC,"A triad is a chord made up of 3 notes that are spaced in a nearly even pattern. (The distance from each note to the note above it is what musicians call a ""third,"" which means about 3-4 semitones or 300-400 cents.) If you are familiar with major and minor chords, those are triads. (For example, the first three notes of the American national anthem are the 3 notes of a major triad.)  ""Diatonic"" means that the chord comes from any scale that has the same sound as the white keys of the piano. That sound is fundamental to most music you are familiar with, probably. Tunes like ""happy birthday"" and ""twinkle twinkle"" are diatonic.  So a diatonic triad is simply a 3-note chord (with the structure I described above) that comes from a diatonic scale."
musictheory,3cidkk,vornska,7,Wed Jul 8 03:53:28 2015 UTC,"To expand: A ""third"" is a generic description based on the letter names assigned to notes. A up to C is a third because it spans the space of three letters (A B C). A triad is a stack of thirds, such as A C E. Not all thirds sound exactly alike because the pitch difference from letter to letter is not always the same, and the quantity descriptor ""third"" doesn't account for sharps and flats, which will change the precise sound of the third (the quality).  Diatonic refers to notes which belong in a given key. Diatonic triads, then, are the chords which will occur naturally in a song where all the notes used belong to that key.   So in C Major (C D E F G A B C), a diatonic triad starting on C will be C E G (C Major). A diatonic triad starting on D would be D F A (d minor).   This goes a bit beyond your question, but if you change the key, the chords will change even if you start with the same root note. For example if we change to c natural minor (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C), the diatonic triad starting on C would now be C Eb G (c minor).  Learning diatonic triads is a fantastic way to improve playing by ear and basic composition because it gives you a head start on what harmonies (chords) are ""supposed to work"" in whatever key you are in, although they are a bit generic."

musictheory,3cidkk,hehyih,2,Wed Jul 8 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"Some things that haven't really been clarified...   A triad is is a 3 note chord in which the 3 notes are the interval of some type of 3rd apart  There are 2 types of ways of looking at the 3rds, the Quality and Quantity *Quality indicates how many half steps between each 3rd, as in 3 half steps is  a minor third, 4 half steps is a major 3rd The quantity indicates the distance in the letters of the intervals (C E G) C d E, E f G.  The diatonic triads are the chords naturally found in any given key (For a major key, the quality of these chords are I ii iii IV V vi viio) If you have a chord, say C# major. Some may think a major 3rd above C# is F, but since C-F is 4 letters apart, this would be considered some type of 4th. F would have to be respelled as E#.  Just so you have triadic formulas, smallest to largest, the 4 types of triads you can build are Diminished (min 3rd, min 3rd), Minor (min 3rd, maj 3rd), Major (maj 3rd, min 3rd), and Augmented (maj 3rd, maj 3rd). In the natural major scale, there are no augmented triads, though these can be found in other circumstances, such as a harmonic minor scale (the III would be III+ because of the raised 7th in the scale)."

Think of it this way you are going from I to ii7. The F#dim is sandwiched in between the two chords and the F# can be perceived as a chromatic passing tone between the F and G. Because in the F# diminished the A and the C are common, the F#dim can be seen as an altered version of the I chord and thus the harmony from the analysis standpoint doesn't change.  If you really wanted to use a Roman numeral you could use a secondary dominant to describe the progression as a viio/ii making the whole progression I - viio/ii - ii7. I personally think just saying it is a passing chord is what makes most sense, but this is also a valid way to look at the progression. http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/25423/which-roman-numeral-should-i-use-for-f-diminished-chord-in-the-key-f-major"

musictheory,3cfi66,Zombater,5,Tue Jul 7 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"Let me explain the places marked with an asterisk or '*'.  In a ""Round,"" you might have multiple voices all singing the same melody beginning at different times. The asterisk is meant to tell the next voice when to begin the melody. Row Row Row Your Boat is a popular ""Round."" It begins like this:   Row Row Row Your Boat   Gently Down the Stream   Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily  Life is but a Dream   In the situation of a Round, you'll have the next voice begin with ""Row Row Row Your Boat..."" when the first voice sings ""Merrily Merrily Merrily Merrily..."" so you end up with this collage of sound. This is called ""Heterophonic Texture,"" and it is particularly useful in Fugues and Canons (another, more technical form title for Round).   tl;dr - The description is essentially saying, ""This piece is a Round, and it is written in a Minor key with up to three players each covering a part. We use an asterisk '*' to show where each player should begin playing the Round in relation to the other players."""
musictheory,3cfi66,Salemosophy,3,Tue Jul 7 16:36:56 2015 UTC,"Just to add one further clarification: The new player begins the round at the beginning when the first player reaches the first asterisk. When the first player reaches the second asterisk (or the second reaches the first, which is hopefully the same moment), the third player begins at the beginning.  The first few times I saw this notation, I was a little confused as well."
musictheory,3cfi66,MusicMan13,8,Tue Jul 7 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"It seems complicated at first, but it's really not that bad. The third degree of the scale is always flat. This is something that all minor scales have in common. Now what is confusing you is the 6th and 7th notes of the scale. Whether these notes are flattened or not depends on which direction they are approached from. If you go down to the 6 or 7, the note is lowered. So in the key of D, you would go D, C, Bb. Same thing also applies if you leap down to the notes instead of just stepping down the scale. When you go upwards to a 6 or 7, it is not lowered and so it sounds major. In D going up, the last notes would be A, B, C#, D. Again, it also applies if you leap up to the 6 or 7. As a general rule then, in melodic minor if you go up to a 6 or 7, think major, if you go down to a 6 or 7, think melodic minor.   I'm not super sharp on my theory history, but the reasoning behind this has to do with the fact that people liked the sound of the half tone between the 7 and 1 of a major scale, but disliked the augmented second between the 6 and 7 of the harmonic minor scale. To fix this, they stopped lowering the 6 on the way up to the leading tone (7). On the way down, the 7 isn't resolving to 1, it's going down to 6, so they didn't need to go out of their way to raise it and it stays flattened like in natural minor, and that means there's no reason to have the 6 raised either, so it also stays flattened like in natural minor. Basically it is a way of making the leading tone not sound weird in a minor key, so raise 6 and 7 before hitting 1, and on the way down go back to natural minor."
musictheory,3cfi66,noossab,9,Tue Jul 7 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"“So, then,” said old Bach, though he wasn’t old yet; in fact, he was young, and his young heart was set on a woman, Maria, he’d long ago met and his wife he did want her to be.  Surmising that — though his shirt hid a six-pack — The way to her heart was to show off his knack For music, he chose as his plan of attack To woo her with music theory.  “So, then,” he repeated, “That piece I just played — The key was not major, you may be dismayed to learn, but instead all the notes were arrayed in a minor mode centered ‘round C.  “To write in C major, and work up a song, Just stay on the white notes the whole way along; The half-steps, you’ll find, are right where they belong: From C to B, and F to E.  “To write in C minor, though, we need to lose The B, E, and A in our scale, and use Notes Bb and Eb — and Ab debuts — But we still start and end it on C.  “Now, this scale is nice. It’s got a dark sound And I’m sure that some future composer profound Will write beautiful music that leaves ‘em spellbound But it’s just not the scale for me.  “The reason for this, I have come to conclude, Is not that the scale is nasty or lewd, But an interval causes it to come unscrewed: A whole-step from B flat to C.  “So what, you may think, we’ve had whole steps before. But this one is in a place hard to ignore: The final two notes of the scale. Therefore There’s no tension before the release!  “Not only does this cause the scale to fail, But the chords that we build from it also derail. Our strong major V chord turns weakly and pale Because it’s spelled G–Bb–D.  “So here’s my solution: tell me what you think. This ‘Natural scale’ can be rid of this kink If we change the B flat back to just B — (wink, wink!) And bring back our half-step to C.  “We do this, and suddenly things start to gel. That half-step between B and C just sounds swell And our V chord is once again major as well So the tension beefs up the release.”  Here, Bach paused for a moment, and turned to the lass, And said with a sigh, “This is good, but alas There’s a problem with it that one cannot bypass. When you hear it, I think you’ll agree.”  Then he went to the keyboard and started to play And he said, “Now, remember, we don’t have an A In this scale, but A flat, and of course, that’s okay But the problem is going to B.  “It’s an augmented second! The sound hurts your ear! The interval’s large, and it makes it sound queer As if written by some old Ummayad Emir On the shores of the Caspian Sea.  “So for harmonies, chords, well, this scale works just fine The tension in dominant chords is divine But for melody-making, it doesn’t quite shine With that augmented second, you see.  “Well, let’s fix it!” smiled Bach. “Hey, we’ve changed it before. We altered one interval, why not alter more? This time, we’ll take that old A flat we abhor And we’ll raise it a half-step toward B.  “And so if we step back, and see what we’ve done We’ll notice the augmented second is gone It’s just whole-steps and half-steps, from C and hereon: D, Eb, F, G, A, B, C.  “So now if you write music where melodies rise In a scalewise passage where minor applies You can use this new scale where strong tension pries But where augmented seconds won’t be.  “There is one more thing, though, before I do close You do recall, I hope, the reason we chose To so quickly and gladly and deftly dispose Of that flat to the left of that B?  “Because doing so gave us the tension we sought From the leading-tone up to the tonic. But what About going the other way round? I think not— We don’t need tension from C to B!  “And so if we return to our minor lament And imagine a scalewise melodic descent We can use the same scale that we did just invent And add flats back to A and to B.”  Fatigued, he turned ‘round. “Do you feel it’s enough? I mean, Claude Monteverdi can’t think up this stuff.” Then she stood, and replied, as she straightened his cuff, “Oh, Johann... you had me at ‘key.’”   EDIT: fixed formatting. Sorry!"

This, especially. Melodic minor only makes sense in the context of the Harmonic minor. Harmonic minor raises the 7th a half degree to create voice leading to the root. The clearest manifestation of this is in a V-I progression, which would be v-I in natural minor. But then when you play the raised 7th, the 6-7 transition sounds worse, so you raise the 6 as well.   On the other hand, if you were playing the progression i-iv-v, you would stick to the natural minor scale, because the 7th degree is not raised in the v chord, and likewise, you would not raise the 6th degree.   The ""going up"" vs ""going down"" is a short-hand way of teaching melodic minor, and it may be held to strictly in some forms of classical music, but IMO in more casual play (and, bear in mind, I'm not formally trained or a professional musician, so take this with a grain of salt), the choice to use melodic minor depends entirely on what chord you are on, and what chord you are going to next in the progression. I think that one could easily contrive an example where the chord progression calls for melodic minor, but the actual melody being played was descending."

The raise 6th and 7th were introduced to provide options in order to avoid awkward leaps, especially in vocal music, and they most often occur in the pattern of raised ascending and lowered descending, and melodic minor scales are pretty much always practiced that way. It's the choice of the composer which to use though, no matter whether the pattern is ascending or descending. Being able to use either the natural 6th and 7th, or the raised 6th and 7th, also greatly incresases the chords available for harmony."

musictheory,3cfi66,superbadsoul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:16:12 2015 UTC,"There have been a lot of in depth answers that address the theory, but skimming them I didn't see a good simple answer for you that doesn't rely on terms you might not have learned yet. I'm going to work of the assumption that you are reading music and not simply finger notation or the like, and also that you know what a key signature is and how they work.  Since you were working in the key of D, I'll stick with it for all my examples here.  It helps here to remember that a scale and key are not automatically the same thing. A scale is a sequence of notes played one at a time in order, where a key is a set of notes with one special one called the tonic that acts sorta like home base. Because they are different, scales can do some things that keys cannot, and the melodic minor is a great example. When you are going UP the D melodic minor scale, the notes are D E F G A B C# D. When you are going DOWN the scale, it changes to D C Bb A G F E D. Two notes change - C# becomes C and B becomes Bb.  So lets say you're playing a song in D melodic minor. If you see a C, how do you know if it should be sharp or not? Do you need to always keep track of if you're moving up or down and remember to switch? Fortunately no, it's much easier than that! You just need to read the music.  Since melodic minor is not a key (and does not follow the rules for a key), there is no melodic minor key signature. A song in D melodic minor would normally be written with the D natural minor key signature - one flat. Any time you are supposed to play B natural instead of B flat, a natural accidental will be written on the note. Any time you are supposed to play C# instead of C natural, a sharp accidental will be written on the note. As long as you play the notes that are written and follow the key signature and any accidentals, you don't even need to know that a song is melodic minor to play it right.  As for the round, they are saying that three people can play that song together using the same sheet music. One person starts playing first. When they reach the first * symbol, the next person joins in, but they start playing at the beginning instead of in the same place. When the first person reaches the second *, the second person should be reaching the first * and the third person can join in."
musictheory,3cfi66,xiipaoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"You're dealing with two completely different things here, ""rounds"" and ""melodic minor scales"" and I think you might be mistakenly tying them together.   First, don't get too hung up on the melodic minor scale in the context of the notes you are playing. The fact that the song features this scale doesn't mean you have to do anything different. The song will simply be written in D minor, and if any part of the song has you playing notes that are specific to the D melodic minor scale, those notes will be written in as accidentals (if you take a quick look, you may find some b-naturals and some c-sharps, which are part of the ascending D melodic minor scale notes). In other words, just play it as written and don't worry about it (but take a mental note of how those notes sound).  Second part is the rounds. The asterisks in the song are only referring to this topic. If a song can be played in rounds, all that means is that a second person and possibly a third or even more people can join in and sing/play the same exact melody that you are, starting at a different time. The classic example is Row Row Row Your Boat.  One person starts singing/playing, then a second person joins in starting from the beginning of the song, etc. Here is a video of a lady teaching muppets how to sing Row Row Row Your Boat in Rounds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nPOa8eF5vU&t=1m4s  Since you're by yourself, you can safely ignore the rounds altogether. But, if you find a second person to fiddle with you, you can start playing through the piece and they can jump in from the top when you hit the first asterisk, then another person can join in when you hit the next one, and you can keep playing the song in an infinite loop until your neighbors inevitably set fire to your house."
musictheory,3cfi66,japaneseknotweed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"All right, this shit's real simple.  First, let's look at Shalom Chaverim.  This is an Israeli children's song, right?  Actually, Jews love to sing.  Problem is, we're too polite to kick out guests when it's too late and we want to do other shit.  But guilt tripping people?  That's our wheelhouse.  So we sing this song, which translates to ""peace out, guys, peace out, guys, peace out, peace out, see ya, see ya, peace out, peace out"", and hope that our guests get the fucking hint and leave.  It's in a happy minor key because when Jews are happy we sing shit in minor, and we're happy at the thought of finally getting some peace and quiet on our day of rest.  Anyway, that's the background on the piece.  (Almost none of the above is true about the piece -- it's really just a children's song -- but on the other hand, we're definitely passive-aggressive enough.)  About the instructions: ""THIS IS A MINOR-KEY ROUND.""  This is a round in a minor key.  A round is when multiple people sing the same thing but they start at different times.  ""IT CAN BE PLAYED IN THREE PARTS WITH AN ENTRY AT EACH OF THE PLACES MARKED *.""  If you get three people together, each of you can play the same thing but start at a different time.  Those three people are players 1, 2, and 3.  1 starts at the beginning.  Then, when 1 gets to the first *, 2 starts at the beginning.  Then, when 1 gets to the next *, 3 starts at the beginning.  Usually, when someone gets to the end they just start again from the top.  That's how a round works.   How do I tell wether to use ascending or descending in a piece?   You don't.  You play whatever the fuck is marked.  If it says Bb, you play a Bb.  If it says B natural, you play a B natural.  So what's the point of learning this weird scale that's different on the way up from the way down?  Well, when most people write music in minor, they do this.  The rules are a little complicated and mostly irrelevant because you can write whatever the fuck you want, but raising the 6th and 7th degrees on the way up is standard practice, so you should be able to play it smoothly on your instrument, get used to how it sounds, etc.  If you're composing in minor, you should be able to tell whether to use ascending or descending (and there are definitely times when you'll want to use the descending form in an ascending passage and vice-versa).  If you're playing a piece someone else already wrote, you don't have to do anything but read what's written.  To give you a simple example, if you're in Cm, you might write G A B C Bb Ab G A B C Bb Ab G...  You see, when you're going up, you raise the Ab and Bb to A and B, respectively, but when you're going down, you don't.  Again, when you would want to use which is actually really complicated; it's not as simple as this example makes it seem.  But you can determine this yourself when you're composing.  Don't worry too much about rules and use your ear.  That's what the melodic minor scale is, anyway.  Composers didn't like the way the natural minor scale sounded going up so they raised some notes.  Maybe you like the natural minor the way it is.  Maybe you like the sound of the raised 6th and 7th in both directions.  Maybe you like the raised 6th but not the raised 7th.  Whatever.  But if you're just playing music that's already written, just do what the damn thing says."

Just read the music, and make sure to pay attention to the #/b markings.   There are three notes in any scale that can be either high or low: #3, #6, and #7.   If 3 is low, the piece will sound minor. To be officially minor, 6 and 7 should be low too.   BUT: In many minor pieces --especially during the Baroque era -- any time the tune headed up to 1 from below, even for a moment, 6 and/or 7 were often flipped back to their high version to give a feeling of leading.  When we play a classical piece written in minor, we are often asked to use BOTH versions of notes 6 and 7, in order for the composer to get the sound he wants.   In order to be ready for this, we prepare by playing the MELODIC minor scale, using the high versions of 6&7 on the way up, the low ones on the way down.  The scale is just a nice, simple way to prepare for what the music is going to do."

If you are reading some kind of tab or fingering to decide what note to play, you could be confused by the difference in the position. If you are reading the notation, the difference is easy to see as the 6th and 7th when raised will have accidentals in front of them. The 6th will have a natural in front of it to raise it from Bflat to B, and the 7th will have a sharp (#) in front of it to raise it from C to C#. Accidentals might also be used to go back to the ordinary 6th and 7th, but are not needed if it's a new bar of music."

You don't need to know if it's ascending or descending - just play the notes in the song. You don't need to change them.

musictheory,3cfi66,b0b,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"If the note goes up, it's ascending. If it goes down, it's descending. In D melodic minor, if B-something goes to A, it's descending, so use B-flat. So for a melody goes A B-something A, use B-flat. If it goes A B-something C-something D, use B-natural & C-sharp. IF it goes D B-something C-something D, use B-natural & C-sharp.  Always use C# if it moves to D. Always use B-natural if it moves to C-sharp. Always use C-natural if it moves to B-flat.  The thing you care about it what note comes next."

You shouldn't have to decide if the 6th or 7th is raised.  If there's an accidental that raises it, raise it.  If there isn't, don't.  If the key signature is D minor and there's a C leading to a D, and there's no accidental, you play a C and a D.  End of story.  If you play a C#, you made a mistake.  Similarly, if I hand you piece of music and tell you it's in G major, and you see a C# and play it as a C, you fucked up.  That was probably part of a secondary dominant.  The performer does not need to be interpreting the harmonic context of every note (which is often not even possible when looking at a single line of music) to determine if it should be altered or not."

musictheory,3cfi66,disaster_face,0,Tue Jul 7 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"The ascending/descending theory is bullshit. When the harmonic context in a minor key goes to the dominant V7 chord (E7 in Am), the scale notes change from b6 and b7 to 6 and 7. In Am, this means that F and G become F# and G#.  It doesn't matter whether the melody is going up or down."
musictheory,3cfi66,omegapisquared,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"In your Dm exercise, the natural minor scale notes are D E F G A Bb C D.  In the V7 (A7 chord) harmonic context, the scale changes to D E F G A B C# D. This builds a tension that typically resolves back to the i (Dm chord), which puts you back in the natural minor scale. It doesn't matter whether the melody is going up or down.  Some minor key songs use IV instead of iv.  In the key of Dm, that means G instead of Gm.  In the IV harmonic context, you use the so-called ""ascending"" scale just as you do in V7.  But again, it doesn't matter whether the melody is going up or down."

The origin of the raised 6th and 7th was absolutely to accommodate the V7 chord.  The V7-i cadence is the whole reason the harmonic and melodic minor scales exist.   I wouldn't go as far as to call the ascending/descending theory bullshit, but would say it's more of an approximation of what happens in actual music, than something that should be adhered to strongly.  The leading tone to tonic is much a stronger resolution than the supertonic to tonic, so it sort of makes sense to think of the ascending scale as being the one that resolves.    In actual minor key music the leading tone usually will go up to the tonic.  That's because it's usually over a V7, though."

It is certainly possible to play something on the piano that is stylized as a song. In fact, song transcriptions for piano do exactly this. The song structure of ""firework"" doesn't suddenly change if you transcribe it for the piano. And I'd argue that you are basically doing the same thing in different mediums.   However, if we alter her side to take a less absolute stance, then I think she is mostly right. It is true that people writing for voice tend to approach it differently from when they write for piano. Composing for piano has its own traditions, it's own forms, it's own limitations, etc. And these will be different from approaching a piece for voice. Compare the output of composers who wrote vocal music and who also wrote piano music, and you'll often find more differences between the respective genres than you will between individual works in one genre.   So, you are both right and are both wrong. You are right that it is possible that a work designed for piano can be the same structure as a work designed for voice.

What do they have in common? A certain subversion of the major scale, making its use ironic or playful rather than straightforwardly joyful. When minor, an extended and tactile exploration of a theme rather than a simple ""hard"" or ""sad"" sound. Unexpected instrumentation or sound effects, especially ones that disorientate.  Scales which achieve this effect are ones with some basis in straight major or minor, with a few odd notes thrown in - #4 or b6 in major; b2 or 3 in minor - and which are dwelt on rather than used as passing notes.

musictheory,3cbmhr,amajorseventh,3,Tue Jul 7 03:11:00 2015 UTC,"I've noticed a lot of major 7th chords in psychedelic music. Sometimes it will replace the root (Fmaj7 instead of Am or C) other times songs will hang the listener in a suspension between two neighboring maj7 chords (Amaj7, Bmaj7) and still other times, it will be used as a way to halfway release from the tonic (I, Imaj7,  IV)  Another trend I've noticed is unexpectedly inserting a half-step shift, often from I. Undoubtedly, this is sometimes part of a more elaborate, round-about way of completing a musical phrase that I as a non-theorist don't fully understand, other times I'm convinced that it's just a playful gimmick.  9th and 11th chords have nice psychedelic feel to them, and the genre as a whole has always been attached to I, II. In terms of modes, I tend to hear Dorian and Lydian the most, often with contrasting chords. In general, it seems that much of the magic of psychedelic music is rooted in keeping our minds as listeners uncertain as to what key or mode we're in, or where we might be going. Frequent dashes of the unexpected or even completely nonsensical are appropriate, as is confusion from dissonance and complex, extended chords."

If you are serious about the art of composing, to reject the rich and varied histories of harmony, counterpoint, and form seems like it would not only put you at a disadvantage, but would have you miss out on a lot of incredible revelations about the reasons why you do what you do.

Studying the same famous musicians as every other person is certainly useful for being able to speak many people's lingo. But, it also alters your taste in music in a way you may not appreciate.  With that said, you need to know how a lot of composers sound in order to pick which ones you want to study. The key thing to take away is to study whatever is relevant to you, what you want. Personally, I think the reinforcement of studying the same musicians is obnoxious. What's the point of learning from the masters if you think their music is boring? That's like learning how to make some famous spicy curry recipe, and you don't like spicy food or curry.   Music is iterative.

musictheory,3cd6pp,Arathun,5,Tue Jul 7 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely convinced by all of your examples, but I agree that it's probably true that most semitonal motion is in an ascending direction.  I would chalk this up to it being likely that most semitonal motion is between a tonic and its leading tone, and that this motion probably occurs mostly in an ascending direction, because the leading tone resolves to (or gravitates toward) the tonic. This might condition hearing all semitonal relations in terms of a tonic and its leading tone, as in your example of an embellished C major triad: B-C-D#-E-F#-G. The B, D#, and F# are the leading tones of C, E, and G respectively.  Of course there is such a thing as an upper leading tone, such as b6 (resolving to 5) and 4 (resolving to 3). b2 (resolving to 1) is also a possibility, but at least in tonal classical styles it is more exotic, and far less common than b6-5 and 4-3. In other words, it is less common for a descending semitone to resolve to a tonic scale degree, and far more likely for it to resolve to a 5 or a 3. This tendency may be so strong that even when we do hear b2-1 we are likely to hear it as either b6-5 (and a concomitant shift to the minor subdominant) or 4-3 (and a concomitant shift to the flat submediant)."

musictheory,3cd6pp,Cdesese,6,Tue Jul 7 04:20:53 2015 UTC,"What I was trying to say was that--at least within classical styles--ascending leading tones are more common, therefore more salient, and therefore we become conditioned to hear them as normal. It's purely a question of what tends to happen most often in a particular style of music, and thus what we become encultured to hear. One can imagine a style in which descending leading tones are the norm instead, and thus descending semitones will be more prominent. If what you're looking for is some kind of universal principle that will explain why ascending leading tones are more prominent than descending ones, then I think you'll be disappointed."

If you're in A minor and you have the G# leading tone, the actual leading tone is G#+1 cent. I assume this would mean that the downward leading tone of A minor would have to be A#-1 cent.   If I play the A minor scale downward like so, A G F E D C Bb, it does feel that it resolves very strongly to A to be honest."

But there are plenty of reasons to ignore this rule, say if those notes where to contradict the harmony (e.g., you wouldn't use ascending melodic minor, or harmonic minor, over a minor v chord, because the #7 would clash with the minor third of the chord). And there's no good reason why you couldn't use the ""ascending"" form of melodic minor in a descending scale.  Here's a simple progression that harmonizes an ascending melodic minor scale (well, just 5-#6-#7-8):    5 #6 #7 8    i IV V42 i6    Notice how major IV results from the use of #6 in the melody."
musictheory,3cd4bv,Cdesese,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think I understand this. So generally if you're rising through #6/#7 you would use the rising scale, and vice versa for descending, but you have to watch out for clashing notes and there's also room for creative freedom.  It seems, like most conventions in music, that they are only guidelines rather than rules and one must adapt to the feel of their music."
musictheory,3cd4bv,BdaMann,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"Generally, the harmonic minor scale is used for harmony and the melodic minor scale is used for melody. When it comes to harmonizing the melodic minor scale in basic common practice era music, you would probably just use the raised 6th scale degree as a passing tone rather than as a chord tone. You don't want to turn the iv chord into a IV because it would sound more like you're borrowing the chord from major or implying a shift to dorian. Unless the melody is ascending to the root of the scale, you would generally keep the 6th and 7th scale degrees lowered to reinforce the minor-ness of the melody."

I know that if I am in for example C minor and use an F major instead of an F minor I will get a sound that I assume is Dorian but I don't know if it's the same thing because modal mixture talks about the sixth scale degree.

It would resolve down nicely to D major, or V in G. In some instances, Eb would substitute for a I (or i) chord. It's better to not look at it as a substitution, though. You're just borrowing it from the parallel minor key. You don't necessarily have to use it in place of something else. Modal mixture is almost exclusively in major tonalities.    I also have a question about secondary dominants. If I want to use a secondary dominant in C major. The dominant to G major. Should I then follow the key signature of C major and play an D minor or think that I am now in G major and play D major   If you're using secondary dominants, you would use the key signature of the chord that the secondary dominant is resolving to. So, if you're in C and you want a secondary dominant to resolve to G, you would need a chord with the root D. In the key of G, D would be major, so you would have D-F#-A, or a D major chord. Secondary dominants are always chromatically altered in some way from the original key signature."

Does the key signature determine the quality of the chord?  If I were to use a tritone substitution for G in the key of C major what quality would the chord have? If i were to use a tritone substitution for G in the key of C minor what quality would the chord have then?

musictheory,3cb33i,TheGreek41,3,Mon Jul 6 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"It's more common than you think, and it's useful for maintaining a fluid sense of chord quality across a progression. Suppose we have I, IV, and V - all major chords - and we want to keep the ""major"" quality consistent across the other chords we use? We have two options in the diatonic sense: 1) alter the third of our minor diatonic chords or 2) borrow the corresponding major chords from the parallel minor. And if you think about it from a voicing standpoint, the borrowed chords tend to move the outer voices (the root and fifth) from their diatonic positions in the major key while the altered chords move the inner voice (the third), raising it a half-step to make the sonority major. Here's the difference in C Major:   Option 1) VI - A Major Chord or A C# E Option 2) bVI - Ab Major Chord or Ab C Eb   Particularly with the bVI, it works because the tonic in this case is C, so the third of bVI holds the tonic in a major third position over the root. That's essentially why it works. But in other songs, you may also  encounter bII, bIII, and bVII in addition to bVI. These are borrowed from other parallel keys and used to keep the chord qualities consistent.   It's not necessarily ""really smart music"" but really just the advantage of working in a tonal system that isn't limited to a single 7-pitch diatonic system. There are 12 pitches that are available in any key, and understanding modes and chord substitution is where we learn how to use the other 5 notes of our key."

A C-major scale is C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, while a C minor scale is C-D-Eb-F-G-Ab-Bb-C. You wouldn't spell it C-D-D#-F-G-G#-A#-C because you're repeating scale degrees.  However, an E minor scale is E-F#-G-A-B-C-D-E, because you wouldn't respell the F# as a Gb.   It's b6 rather than #5 because of it's functionality in the piece. It's leading to a V chord. Now, it's possible to have what would look like a #5dim chord in a progression, as it would be leading to vi."

One further question: do diminished chords only lead up??  If so.. I've always wondered what to use between a downward movement in place of a diminished chord if it is used to travel downwards by half steps.. does that make sense??
musictheory,3cb33i,mazegeek999,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:27:37 2015 UTC,"Diminished chords tend to lead up, yes, but there's a lot of cases where it does not necessarily have to. You can often find diminished chords in first inversion, meaning the bass note of the chord is the third of the diminished chord. So, in example, a B diminished chord in first inversion would have D in the bass. This then leads ""up"" to some sort of C chord, whether it's major or minor. So your bassline can be D-C, moving down, but the chords are still Bdim-C. Or you can move the D up to an Eb (Or an E, depending whether you want C major or minor).  Diminished chords are also almost solely used as a dominant function. And because of that, you can also move to another dominant function with them. What I mean there is basically, by changing one note, you can change a diminished chord into a dominant 7 chord (One way to think of it is vii°7 = V7b9 with no root). So lets say you have G#-B-D-F, a fully dimished 7 chord. If you drop the G# to a G, you have a G7 chord (G-B-D-F). You can drop any of the notes a half step to get another dominant chord, in fact, So you can easily change this diminished 7 chord into G7, Bb7, Db7, or E7. And from there you can continue functionally downwards (Say a progression is Bdim/G#->G7/G->G7/F->Cm/Eb->Bdim/D->Cm/C).   So basically, inversions are your friends when moving downwards. Check out rule of the octave as well, which is an 18th century approach to learning how to ascend and descend the bass by step and what chords to use. Of course in more contemporary times, some chords can be muddled with for my exotic progressions."
musictheory,3cb33i,RadiateThe88s,3,Tue Jul 7 12:52:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's b6 because the note Ab comes from the C minor scale, in which it is the 6th note. That scale has a 5th note (G) which is unaltered, (so neither flat nor sharp), but its 6th note is flat compared to the major scale so we would generally call it a b6. Like others have said, a #5 could exist, but it would function much differently.   Essentially in this case (as in many soul chord progressions), they ""took"" that chord out of C minor and ""put"" it in a chord progression that's in C major. It's really just something that soul/R&B musicians have liked the sound of for many decades now, and like many other aspects of popular music, it's hard to fit into the paradigm of classical ""music theory."""

musictheory,3cb33i,veggiter,2,Tue Jul 7 06:28:43 2015 UTC,"no, #5 is pretty weird.  I think what they're trying to do on the verse is create a cadence towards the first chord of the pre-chorus, which is G7. It's a bit weird sounding because the verse repeats before hitting the pre-chorus, so you end up with that Ab at the end of the verse repeating to the E at the beginining.  But what they're after, I think, is the Ab->G movement from the end of the verse to the beginning of the pre-chorus. Because when that happens in the song, it sounds less jarring."

As for your OP question, I know of a couple of videos out there that offer analyses of Romantic era and later works, but they mostly only mention meter if it's used particularly in a section of music to really strike a point. Many classical composers (For instance, impressionist composer Debussy) viewed meter as a secondary or tertiary device for conveying musical ideas where the coloring of chord voicings and tonality are foremost. When there are literally a dozen things you can remark on in a single measure, these primary aims of the composer usually take precedence.

Associating a note on the screen with a place on your instrument sounds cool, but you have to remember it's guitar-you have 4 of the same G pitches on the last four strings (6th string 15th fret, 5th & 10th, 4th & 5th, 3rd open). Each note on the screen refers to all of them, and if you do end up doing something like what you've laid out, make sure you play the notes all over the neck for the most benefit/least screwing you over down the line.  That being said, please don't do this. Sheet music is more like a story than a random collection of individual letters-when you read, you aren't thinking, ""oh! There's a g! There's an f. There's an e."" You're (eventually) thinking things like ""oh! We're in c and descending from g!""

Not that I'm complaining, he did something really amazing with it. Maybe tomorrow I will look through the piece to see if there are any modal speciation. Can you name the chords arpeggiated that occur starting at 1:06? Thanks again"

musictheory,3c8h5o,AmbiguousAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"The crazy thing about this, to me, is that it was just recorded in a bedroom studio.  Say what you want about AAL but they were definitely a major step forward for prog rock in terms of incorporating new rhythms, timbres, and even harmony with metal.  The current guitarists have a cool side project T.R.A.M..  Give that whole tune a spin.  Its much more raw.  Its two guitars, saxophone, and drums.  There is as much rhythmic insanity but at times more of a sense of breath.   Edit: HAAS Kicker is pretty cool, too."
musictheory,3c8h5o,GuitarGreg,3,Mon Jul 6 16:26:36 2015 UTC,"To me, this album has a bit of a Meshuggah influence. There are parts where you get the sense of that kind of grinding sound, a stuttering along. Sort of hard to describe, but a part in Tempting Time that reminds me of this is at 1:45. It's only about a 12 second phrase.    It's just a simple rhythmic pattern but Abasi starts out his phrase half-way through the pattern, so the whole way through, it just sounds disjointed. Also the snare in this part is not consistent, so even though you are expecting a so-called ""linear syncopation"" of the riff, it's not like this because the drums are hitting even outside of where you expect the syncopation might hit. If you listen to the timing of the snare, it does have a pattern, that is sort of syncopated to itself. So when you super-impose it on the shifted guitar riff, you get a sort of double-syncopation. This is the pattern I came up with for the guitar in this part:    x = longer hit, . = shorter hit    x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x . xx . x . x~     The kick just follows the guitar, and the snare sort of ""rides on top"". Above notation with s=snare added:    x . xxs. x . x . xxs. x . x . xsx . xs. x . xxs. x . x . xxs. x . x . xxs. x . x . xsx . xs. x . xxs. x . x~     To my ear, this is three bars of 4/4 and one bar of 3/4, all repeated twice. I notated it like this, at 161BPM.    http://i.imgur.com/YZOEpE6.jpg    Probably took me over an hour to get this... just finding the underlying tempo was a bitch. There's so much going on. I may be wrong on this... just my $0.02! In the tab, Gtr I is guitar, Gtr II is drum notation with low notes being kick drum (following guitar line) and high notes being snare hits. The picture is kind of hard to see... but I'm hearing dotted staccato eighth notes with sixteenth notes in between.    The funny thing about this whole part is that there is a quiet clean arpeggio in the background that is just doing a straight rhythm. This is another thing that seems borrowed from Meshuggah -- having that straight-feel phrasing/clean riff, underneath a mental chugging rhythm."
musictheory,3c8h5o,GuitarGreg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:14:23 2015 UTC,"Wow - this is attempt number three to reply to this post. I must really want to continue this discussion. First time my computer died, second time I accidentally closed my tab... Geez.  Let me restate (for the third time) that I am deeply grateful that you are willing to put so much effort into a reply to this thread, especially considering that the piece of music in question is only twelve seconds long. That shows serious dedication, and it's why I want to provide a thorough reply to this comment.  What you are describing is an 11/16 ostinato in the guitar voice, with another 11/16 pattern played in the drum voice with some very spicy advanced syncopation thrown in to make the whole thing sound very outre and off-kilter, but we can break it down to nothin' in a jiffy.  First off, the notation you have is good, but barely not perfect, and I believe a large part of your difficulty notating this part stems from the fact that the notation you have delineated in your picture is supposed to be somewhere in the 115-118 range. What you have here is technically possible to notate in 161 bpm, but it is probably much harder to count with a dotted rhythm, and the rest of this piece follows a very strict quarter note pulse at the above described bpm range.  This style of music, what u/808scripture calls ""djent"", highly emphasizes the ""groove"" of a piece, which I would describe as the juxtaposition of a constant quarter-note pulse with myriad syncopation devices throughout. The whole piece does not have to squarely add up to an even count of 4/4, although some bands, like Meshuggah, as you mentioned, do maintain this strict article of structure. This, in combination with the programmatic nature of the drums, and the simplicity of the notation at the native bpm the rest of the piece relays shows me that this section is probably 116 bpm or so. The tricky thing about music like this is that there can be many different ways to construe and notate rhythm and meter, but I always find that if I can do it simply, I should.  Now, what's up with this 11/16 thing? How do we even count it? For the purpose of this section, I have decided to count this section like four triplets minus one breath, e.g.  one-and-uh-two-and-uh-three-and-uh-four-and|one-and-uh etc.  Where each syllable lasts the duration of one sixteenth note.  The rhythm for the section can be notated (poorly) as such:  S  = sixteenth note = short  8_= eighth note = long  1+u2+u3+u4+           |     |      |     |     |     |      |     |  8_S8_8_S8_S          nuh duh-nuh nuh duh-nuh duh|nuh  The reason this sounds like it starts in the middle is because it's such an asymmetrical meter, and because the small clusters of notes overlap in between bars. There's a sixteenth note that butts up at the very end of the measure on the and of four against the note on the one of the very next measure! Cool!  The asymmetry of this ostinato can be heard if you listen carefully between 1:45 and 1:51 - the splash cymbal at the end of those four measures signifies when the measures come back around and ""reset"" back on the 1 of the first of four measures. I call this beat permutation.  So what's up, drums? These guys are just hot as shit right here. The kick and china follow the guitar voice's ostinato exactly, but the snare is the really cool feature. Throughout this song, there are certain formulaic things you can find the snare drum doing, and one thing is attacking right on or immediately after the last note in a cluster of notes from the guitar melody. You can hear this effect when you listen to the beginning of the song at about :22 :  123 1234 1234 1234  Each bolded number is where a snare hits at the end of a cluster of notes in the melody line.  Here, in the section we're discussing, the snare attacks right after a cluster of notes in this ostinato. Keeping in mind that we count our 11/16 measure like 4 triplets minus one breath, the snare comes in on 3 for the first two measures:  1+u2+u3+u4+ 8_S8_8_S8_S  ----------T----- (It's hard to tell, but that's the snare, and it's under a 3)  Then on the and of 2 and 4 on the third:  1+u2+u3+u4+ 8_S8_8_S8_S  -------T------T-  And then back on the 3 for the final measure. Then splash, repeat.  So in keeping with our formula, we only see snares on the beat directly after a long note (eighth note), which all happen to be at the end of the note clusters in this motif.    So here's my most favorite thing of all about this ostinato. This is actually a restatement of the underlying ostinato recurrent through the entire previous section! Check out the section between 1:06 and 1:42, that ostinato is everywhere! If you're having trouble counting this section (remember, we're looking for an eleven count), keep this in mind: there are sixteen measures of 11/16 in that section. That's almost like saying eight counts of 11/8, or four counts of 11/4. Tap your foot to that quarter note that you get a strong feeling of in the previous segment, then count to eleven four times. Presto, you're out of there. Now, do it again, tapping your foot twice as fast, counting to eleven, but this time eight times. To get the 11/16 count, I find it easiest to listen to the guitar lead here (since I'm a guitar player, and I'm used to hearing that tonal range/articulation) and count 5+6 following the melody.  PM me for any clarification, or comment further for others to join in on the fun!"

musictheory,3c8h5o,808scripture,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"So I had a read through, what you've said makes sense. I had started transcribing that part out then some friends dropped in half-way through and kind of interrupted me. I finished it off after they left. Your 11/16 makes more sense and yes, the ostinato is definitely apparent right before it. To me, I feel an 8th note pulse far stronger than a quarter note pulse.    BTW, if you want to write out stuff like your 1+u2+u3+u4+ super-imposed over the 8S8_8_S8_S and T for snare stuff, use reddit's code notation. Just put four spaces at the beginning of each line:    1+u2+u3+u4+   8_S8_8_S8_S   ----T----T-     As for beat permutation, I heard that cymbal splash too. You'll notice it lines up with the restarting of my (three bars of 4/4 + one bar of 3/4) measure. Haake in Meshuggah does this a lot too. Look at the song Marrow from the Koloss album, the outro phrase that starts at 4:43. It's a very similar thing to this section of Tempting Time, but the pattern on the guitars is a lot more odd. You can feel the revolutions of the whole section because Haake does a big tom fill where it all starts repeating again, and within it, he does quick bursts on the snare to signify the middle of the sections. I made a post on the /r/Meshuggah forum a while back with an analysis of that riffage from Marrow, if you want to have a read -- https://www.reddit.com/r/Meshuggah/comments/2vg5no/mouthriffing_meshuggah_songs/cohovq0"

Sheet music would be helpful, but it sounds like this stuff came out of some really intense jam sessions with some very skilled musicians. You're doing well to divide the music into sections and tackling them in smaller portions at a time.   The good news is that most of your analysis will be spent on rhythm. The harmonic motion of the piece is fairly slow and easier to discern in contrast to the bombastic rhythmic approach.   Honestly, I'll be real with you about the rhythm here. There's a point where finding the meter really doesn't discern much for you when the idea of a piece is to obscure the pulse. The ideas shift so frequently and with such nuance that finding a meter to fit this really doesn't make a whole lot of sense at all. How does one go about writing this? I have no idea.   For the person that ends up with the job of writing this out - with clean, solid notation - I hope that person is paid a LOT of money for their time and effort. It is no easy feat to dictate this, by ear only, into something useful that can be studied. If that's your gig, Godspeed!"

The drums are what is putting your count a bit off, the snare in the first iteration repeatedly strikes on the downbeat. During the second iteration the groove stabilises into a proper 4/4. I've got guitar tab somewhere in my hard drive, I just need to dig it up from there."

If the meter were ambiguous it would still be polymetric because one rhythmic voice (the guitar) has a reasonably clear meter, but the other rhythmic voice (the drums) would logically fit any x/4 meter better despite sharing the same 16th note subdivision as the guitar. Can't hear a triplet feel in the shredding, but I would probably notate bits of it as triplets. Harmonically it seems to be based around B (phrygian), sometimes with a C chord superimposed over a B pedal tone. I suggest starting a full transcription and posting your progress :)"

musictheory,3cby5s,LydianAlchemist,3,Mon Jul 6 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like the B7b5 A7b5 is correct (I'd rather call it B7#11 A7#11). I couldn't tell you the reason for the discrepancy. You can  find a free copy online of the Jamey Abersol Jazz Play Along vol 27 that Wikipedia references to see if Wikipedia is quoting correctly.   Ultimately, the chords are acting as sonic color as much as anything else. When get away from thinking in terms of strict function, you can do a lot more with the sound.   Edit: and in fact, it is common for musicians to come up with new changes so they aren't playing the same thing a hundred times over. Both could be what Coltrane's group have played at different times."
musictheory,3cby5s,setecordas,3,Mon Jul 6 20:18:49 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, there is an Eb in the bass throughout that, so the second set of changes is missing that information. But really, neither one is a particularly better answer than the other. They can suggest different voicings, but ultimately they're implying the same set of notes (I agree with /u/setecordas that #11 describes it better than b5): for the first, B C# D# E# F# G# A, and for the second, A B C# D# E F# G.  This kind of chart is often played very modally, i.e. you're concerned more with collections of notes to draw from rather than explicit chord progressions. I personally would default to the second set of chords since 7#11/7b5 is a more common chord to deal with and think about than maj7#5, but you could write it either way.  tl;dr I think the best answer is B7(#11)/Eb and A7(#11)/Eb, but in this kind of jazz, it's pretty subjective."

musictheory,3c8svo,Xenoceratops,5,Mon Jul 6 05:50:39 2015 UTC,"At one point in time, all of the clefs were movable. Look up the French violin clef or the subbass clef, for example. These are just the G and F clefs moved to different locations on the staff. The C clef still retains this flexibility in modern music, but I think we can all agree that most musicians are weakest on C clef. I believe that the standardization of clef locations is mostly a good thing, as it means that a musician can count on a part to look a certain way and therefore get to reading faster, but now musicians tend to look at the notes in relation to the staff rather than to the clef. As a musical culture, we've lost much of the ability to do all of that clef transposition.  I had a brass pedagogy teacher who taught his younger students to read starting with a one-line clef to which any pitch could be assigned (""A"" clef or ""B"" clef, any letter you want). He introduced ledger lines right away. The notation looked something like this (with the standard notation equivalent on the bottom, though that melody could be in any octave, so both the trumpets and the tubas could participate). The rhythms are relative and open to interpretation, and he would instruct that black notes are shorter in duration while hollow notes are longer, and that a dot would make the duration longer. Later on, he would add more staff lines, and by that time the student was well acquainted with any clef that you could possibly throw at them, as well as ledger lines and all that business. He also had his students improvising from day one, by buzzing on the mouthpiece and doing a rhythm or following the contour of a squiggly line, or buzzing out an improvised contour for a student to imitate and then make up their own for the next student to imitate, and so on. Really cool guy. I enjoyed his methodology."

As for how many scales there are, as you've noticed it all depends on how you count 'em. For me it's often easiest to say a ""scale"" is ""any pitch class set with a distinguished note, ignoring transpositions"". I don't usually care much about whether the notes are being heard sequentially or at the same time (as a chord), for example.   The comment by /u/heidavey explains how I get 2048 (pick the tonic and then you have 11 more notes that can be either in or out of the scale, giving 211 = 2048).  Yes, that number includes everything -- the scale that's just one note, all the 2-note intervals, all the 3-note collections etc all the way up to the ""chromatic scale"" of all 12 notes.   In most settings you'll probably only want to include some of those 2048, but which ones exactly will depend on the context.  Hope this helps!"

That does include single tones and intervals.  What is wrong with considering intervals to be scales? Or indeed, single notes?  Otherwise, one needs to start including an arbitrary definition of what constitutes a scale.

It's better to call it by the note name, e.g ""we're only playing C"" rather than ""we're in the C scale"".  I don't even consider minor or any mode to be it's own scale.

Any dominant, including an applied dominant, can be back-related.  Here's an example.  Here's another example, similar to the one you've given. In measure 3, we have a back-related V6/I (itself tonicized lightly by V42/V), and in measure 7 we have a back-related V6/bVII (again, itself tonicized by its own V42 chord).  At least one mainstream music theory textbook, Aldwell and Schachter's Harmony and Voice Leading (4th Edition), describes this concept (on p. 491)."

The best theory teacher I ever had told me, ""Remember: if you're successful like you want to be, someone is going to be reading this."" Back-relating is a form of Occam's Razor in music - accomplishing something by the simplest possible means. Think about what the alternative would be: a gymnastic attempt to make Neapolitan bulls*** fit where it is not wanted. Chromatics and tonal reduction always tend to make Roman numeral notation fuzzy - but just remember that numeral notation is all in the service of resolution. When you're notating, forward or backward, keep the Tonic (I) in mind and you'll never go wrong."

musictheory,3c7hzh,bluefish1432,5,Sun Jul 5 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"Creating tension to me basically equates to creating a musical thesis and then adding contrary elements, or subtracting consonant elements. There are a thousand different creative ways you could do this with reference to this one clip of music. The musical thesis you have is already established by the melody of the synthesizer and the pulse of the quarter note click in the background.  Expanding on what chunter16 offered, I can give you specific examples in each category of music specified from:  "">arrangement (the addition and subtraction of instruments)   dynamic level (volume) timbre (change of tone) pitch harmony rhythm tempo""   arrangement Are you intending to add more instrumentation to this track besides the synth lead and the backing pulse?   If no, it may be cool to experiment with subtracting pieces of the backbeat quarter note pulse at odd, even, or random intervals. What could be more tense in electronic, dance-able music than to cut out the strong rhythm element that keeps everything together? If yes, perhaps another synth in the bass register would sound nice (this would relate to pitch and harmony), but to create tension you would want to start playing with its rhythm or its timbre. You have a nice syncopated, dotted rhythm thing going on in the first place with your melody line, with instances of stacatto, so maybe something a little more rhythmically straightforward (no dots) with longer note duration would add some interesting tension. A synth in an even higher register would perhaps also create tension, depending on what it's doing harmonically.   dynamic level  Creating a difference of your dynamics by starting with a lower volume and escalating to a higher volume over the course of the two measures presented, while a common electronics music trope, would certainly do the trick. Alternatively, depending on how experimental you're feeling, you could start loudly and ease down into a quiet pianissimo, before hitting really hard at the end with a sudden fortissimo. Also a trope, though it's not often found in electronic music of this nature, in my experience.  pitch  This is basically the power steering of creating tension in music, especially when combined well with harmony. The melody you've created follows a simple pentatonic pattern in A Minor, with some ""color"" notes thrown in that are basically consonant to the key of A minor near the end of the phrase. The minor 2nd in particular right before you reach the tonic note at the end of each measure does wonders for creating tension here, especially when you consider that the minor pentatonic is composed of all of the ""strong"" notes in the key of a minor, which gives it its character of being minor and in A, and don't do much else. So, that minor 2nd (which is the second to last note here), breaks up the monotony of the A Minor pentatonic, adding both interest AND tension because the minor 2nd wishes to naturally resolve to the tonic. Adding more notes in the natural minor scale (or even going chromatic, be careful!) can be a rewarding way to tense up this sucker. You use stepwise motion for the most part (I think entirely?) in this melody. Another thing to try would be to create some larger interval jumps . Keeping in A Minor, you could try ornamenting the melody with some wide intervals, like hitting the 6th after the 3rd at the beginning, which to be honest, may not sound very good. Let your ear be your guide, and try to find the pitches that seem to want to head strongly toward either the 5 or the 1 of A Minor. Place them in weak beat areas (preceding the 1 or 3 of your 4/4 count) so that when they resolve they can do so on the strong beat emphasis of the 1 or 3. Place your ""strong"" notes accordingly.  A Minor Pentatonic  A (B) C D E (F) G  Parenthetical notes are not included in A Minor Pentatonic, and are a part of the natural minor scale. They are the 2nd and the sixth, and they could be your friends here.  harmony  Hoo-ee. So there's no harmony to speak of here at the moment, so there's not much to talk about unless we discuss some of the hypothetical harmony scenarios you could run into. As was previously stated, you're in the key of A Minor, using the A Minor Pentatonic Scale predominately. We can construct a chord to underlay the melody you've selected by using the tones present in each measure. The melody begins in measure one on the 4th of the scale, which is a D. Constructing a chord in A Minor using D as the root would give us a D Minor chord (triad-DFA). The next measure is looking for the tonic chord A Minor (triad-ACE) because it starts on the A note itself. Measure three is a repeat of measure one, so we can use that D Minor chord again. The next measure after that (4) begins on the tonic A, and includes the 7th G, implying that a 7th chord could be used (which would be quite boring after having just used an A Minor triad), or some triad variation of it, like a major 3rd chord (triad-CEG), but it would also be possible for you to use a chord strongly stressing the 7th scale degree (G), so in A Minor, that would be a G minor chord. This may be a good chord to use since the 7th scale degree is a tense scale degree, and a chord using the 7th as its root would very much want to resolve to the tonic chord. Moving along, you have another couple measures with a strong tonic emphasis, so those would probably once again best be suited to good ol' A minor. Wrapping up the melody, on the last two measures of 4/4, we encounter some interesting areas where your ear has already used tension to make these bits a little more interesting. The second to last measure utilizes the 4th in a cool way, so it may be a good time to bust out a chord centered around that note, which in this case would be D Minor, followed by the tonic chord to finish things up on the last measure and give a strong sense of resolution. However, we've used D Minor so much that it's starting to get a little stale, and the second to last chord in a progression is a special chord that can be used to build up a lot of tension right before the measure blows its load on the last chord, giving that sense of tension-then-release. So, another chord we can use that would also utilize the D would be a chord using D as its seventh, its fifth, or its third. Those could be EMaj7, Gmin (which we've already used), or BMaj. I like EMaj7 personally, but you should try any of them to see what you like.  Whew! Recap:  iv-i-iv-vii-iv-i-VI7-i  The true tension should come about from your second to last chord and last chord interacting, as I mentioned. These last two chords in a progression are called cadence, and there are many different kinds. The one we're using is called a plagal cadence, which you should know implies more tension than a cadence which uses a V as its antecedent chord, as is more common.  Simply using these chords (or others of your liking) will help to build tension in this piece, without going through the rigors of dramatically restating any kind of harmonic content. You can find substitutions for some or all of these chords, but using the melody you have and emphasizing the tension that already exists is a simple way to accomplish your goal.  rhythm  Where has the time gone? Rhythm-induced tension should be all about contrary rhythmic devices, at least contrary to the pulse. So you have a pulse present in your piece; work against it. You already have examples of staccato rhythm and syncopation, you could embellish those if you so choose, or you could choose to add a second voice (like the bass synth we talked about earlier) to create a juxtaposition of rhythm against your first melody line. Don't forget that you can also use more irrational rhythms to create tension in your music, like having a triplet line underneath your melody. Don't forget to utilize meter with your rhythm, if you so choose. You can build rhythmic devices that repeat, called ostinatos, that only last, for instance, 3/8 of your 4/4 meter, to counteract the straighter rhythm you have in the main melody line.  tempo  This can be a little tricky in such a short piece. Using tempo (or rather tempo fluctuations/permutations) in your music is usually more easily implemented in longer pieces where you have more time to drive home the point of say, a gradually increasing or decreasing tempo). There's a wonderful wiki article about ""metric modulation"" which is a little advanced but has to do with ways you can change tempos in proportional manners to your current tempo and an irrational rhythm. Of course, it's worth noting that for any duration of music, a very fast or very slow tempo can create tension.    What a lot. I'm sorry, this got way out of control. Please forgive any typos or other mistakes, and bear in mind, I'm not a professional music educator, just a nerd with a lot of passion.  TL;DR Examine your music analytically using the highpoints that u/chunter16 outlined in his post, find ways to create major contradictions in your music using these elements. There are many examples throughout this post if you care to look. Cheers!  Edit: Formatting"

Dissonance is the most obvious, but not always the most appropriate. Prolonged loudness or prolonged quietness that goes on longer than expected can create extreme tension as well. Since this is tonal music, pedal points and continuous use of the same chord- particularly dominant chords- can be extremely tense. Texture is an underrated element to tension as well: experiment with a wider variety of synth textures and see which one helps build tension most effectively.  And of course, you can combine any number of these elements together in any order if one doesn't work on its own."

musictheory,3c8u6j,Cdesese,2,Mon Jul 6 00:04:04 2015 UTC,"Well, that's just wrong. It's easy to find instances of the natural minor scale in all sorts of classical music. Take this bit from the passacaglia from Handel's G minor harpsichord suite: some really obvious G natural minor scales in the first measure there, and it's not even until the second half of the third measure that we get an F#. The natural minor scale has important roles to play in classical music.  What I read behind a statement like ""almost nothing is natural minor [in classical music]"" is the fact that in classical music the major dominant is used in cadences in minor keys, and the major dominant comes from either the harmonic or ascending melodic minor scales, not natural minor (again, I refer to the Handel example above, where in the fourth measure a major dominant chord, D major, harmonizes a G ""ascending"" melodic minor scale). But this doesn't mean that classical music doesn't use the natural minor scale.  I think the confusion here stems from a false equation of ""scale"" with ""key."" It doesn't make sense to say that something is ""in G natural minor"" or ""G harmonic minor"" or anything like that, at least with respect to classical music. There is only ""G minor"" as a key--that is, a key with a G minor triad as its tonic chord. Separate from G minor the key are various types of G minor scales--scales that are centered on G and have a minor third (Bb), and usually also share the same first five notes (G-A-Bb-C-D), varying in the form of their sixth and seventh degrees (Eb vs. E, F vs. F#). Any type of G minor scale could occur in the course of a passage in G minor. At most, you could say that, in a classical piece in G minor, only the G harmonic minor scale is guaranteed to be used, because at some point there will have to be a major dominant, requiring F#, but even then it wouldn't be right to say that the piece is ""in G harmonic minor."""

This may sound like a weird thing to do, but what if I were to use the G Major scale exclusively in a composition with B's everywhere except for the tonic triad where I use Bb? Would this piece be considered to be in G minor?  (I think the confusion arises from the fact that the theory textbooks I've seen never bother to define explicitly and precisely what it means for a piece to be in G minor vs G major. They introduce the scales, and make a lot of effort explaining why a piece is in G as opposed to something else. And then students try to reach their own conclusions on how minor scales are to be used. And then there are those Picadilly thirds, etc.)"
musictheory,3c8u6j,Cdesese,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'd call that a piece in G major that ends, rather unexpectedly, with a minor tonic, a kind of reverse Picardie-third effect.  It's usually easy enough to define the mode of a piece, because one mode or the other is usually much more prevalent. And certain kinds of mode changes--minor to major in particular--are codified in various idioms that don't really complicate things that much, such as the ""Picardie third"" (it's still a minor-mode piece, it just ends with a major triad), and the recasting of the relative-major subordinate theme of a sonata exposition in the parallel major in the recapitulation. There is music that is truly ambiguous about the mode of its tonic triad (the first movement of Schubert's G major string quartet is a famous example), but it is exceptional for precisely that reason. In such cases, it's better to speak of a tonality only in terms of its tonic pitch, and remain agnostic about the mode."

If you go get an undergraduate music degree from most schools in a program not specifically for jazz studies or commercial music, you'll find that the program basically ignores anything that has happened in the last hundred years, especially from a theory perspective.  The only thing that will even come up might be some of the post-tonal stuff, but their perspectives on the evolution of harmony pretty much end romantic at best, and more likely pre-romantic.  And they tend to spread the gospel of a certain elitism toward a particular type of music.  I was fully part of it at one time.  But it seriously is similar to a cult-like religion in how insular it can be.  You get outside and start learning about other stuff outside of their tenants and you realize that their world view is extremely limited and more through ignorance than malice, they keep trying to spread their message that discourages association with dirty outside influences.  Depending on how adherent they are, that can range from rock, to pop, to jazz.  People tend to fall on a spectrum of what is ""legitimate"" to them.  It tends to be a world of teachers teaching people to be teachers, but ultimately it's the blind leading the blind as so few teaching at that level have a lot of real world experience in performance or even if they do, it's rarely in a diversity of styles.  It's a bit of an ouroboros.  What kinds of jobs can people who only have classical training get?  Oh... teaching jobs.

Many colleagues of mine perform, listen to, compose, and study all varieties of music, including classical, jazz, rock, rap, and popular music.  Things may be different in other parts of the world, but in North America the concept of the natural minor scale (as well as modes and other scales) is taught to students in programs oriented towards classical music. I teach it to my students. In fact, I teach it to them in a variety of ways: as the natural minor scale, as the Aeolian mode, as the descending melodic minor scale. I teach them how to use it in melodies and chord progressions. As my previous comment details, the natural minor scale is extremely important in classical music. Anyone who says otherwise doesn't know what they're talking about.

What I worry about is the approach of musical academia more broadly.  What gets attention and what doesn't.  Certain concepts that have little practical consideration still get far too much time in many (if not most) theory classrooms in lieu of more applicable information.  Like I said, perhaps times are changing or perhaps your institution is an exception (and I hope that either is true), but while many of my professors were active performers, most were only active in a very narrow slice of the music world.   You criticize the apparent elitism of classically-trained musicians and teachers, yet your sneering attitude towards them is about as elitist as it gets.   A fair criticism.  Though, for me, it's more an issue of frustration with how I feel students are being misled than than an issue of me feeling superior.  I do feel like I'm a better musician than I was when I only followed the prescribed route.  I certainly see how it comes off as elitism, or at the very least snarky and sneering.  But my backlash is against the types of conversations I frequently have with musicians who wouldn't lower themselves to play popular music or even jazz.  In fact, those attitudes pop up constantly in this subreddit.  So while I may sound acerbic, who is really the elitist?  The person trying to embrace everything as legitimate or the people turning their noses up when someone mentions pop music?  This is what makes me think it's still a major problem in universities.  There's just far too much of that attitude still floating around.  People are literally proud of their own musical ignorance as if learning about styles outside of the ""masters"" would somehow sully them.  It's probably not helped by the fact that college has turned into grade 13 and students (not just music students) just expect the 'truth' to be dispensed into them directly and have no desire to ask broader questions.     I also think a lot of my ire is directed at undergraduate performance programs which I almost feel like shouldn't exist in most schools.  Especially if you're going to spend 4 years telling instrumentalists like trumpet players or piano players that they need to focus exclusively on orchestral excerpts/classical rep.  No... that's a bald faced lie.  If they are trying to get a job performing they need to be more versatile and you're horribly misinforming them about their prospects.  Even if you tell them how hard it will be, you're not even getting close to really expressing the reality of it.    This area is where I feel most programs do the greatest disservice to students who are naive enough to think they can legitimately just go land a job as a classical concert pianist, orchestral wind player, or opera singer."

musictheory,3c8igx,vornska,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:01:14 2015 UTC,"""The Complete Musician An Integrated Approach to Tonal Theory, Analysis, and Listening"" probably is what kind of book I was looking for.

I found this on Amazon but why does it say 3rd edition? Is it the third book of the series? http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Musician-Integrated-Approach-Listening/dp/0199742782/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436144961&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Complete+Musician%3A+An+Integrated+Approach+to+Tonal+Theory%2C+Analysis%2C+and+Listening  Thanks"
musictheory,3c8igx,nmitchell076,2,Mon Jul 6 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"The Schoenberg is not a bad book. As a quick reference, however, it is not really the best. So many of the points are bound up in rants or tirades, which is great if you want to read those and get to know Schoenberg through them. But it's not the best if you want a book that you can just grab and turn to a crystal-clear explanation of a concept.   The Laitz is definitely a good standard.  If you have already had theory once in school and are just looking for a more compact reference, check out Laitz's Graduate Review of Tonal Theory book. It's the same content with less hand holding, and it's cheaper!   Edit: it says third edition because it's the third ""revision"" of the book that's been issued. It's just one book, there's no second or third volume or anything. But after a while, publishers will put these books out again as a new edition, often with corrections and new content. Usually to make that $."
musictheory,3c8igx,nmitchell076,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:10:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer! Do ""The Complete Musician An Integrated Approach to Tonal Theory, Analysis, and Listening"" cover orchestration? I also looked up a book by Walter Piston named Harmony which one is the best bet? I want to use these books as theory reference and a study in musical composition. I fear that Schoenbergs books will offer too experimental music of his own. I saw that Schoengberg also had a book named ""Fundamentals of Musical Composition"".  It's quite difficult to choose the right books."
musictheory,3c8igx,Cdesese,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"Schoenberg's books are usually about common practice music (counterpoint, harmony, etc.), so no worries there. As for the Piston, again, it isn't too bad. But it's dated. Its not really written with a student of the 21st century in mind. Aldwell/Schacter, Laitz, Clendenning/Marvin, etc. are. Theory pedagogy has come a long way in the last 50 years, much less the last century.   As for orchestration, no harmony book is going to cover that. Your best bet there would be something like ""The Study of Orchestration"" by Samuel Adler. You could probably get by with the Rimsky-Korsakov. The concepts that both books cover are covered equally well by both. However, the Adler discusses contemporary techniques as well, techniques that RK simply didn't have access to. And to me, that puts it over into the top slot as an all-purpose reference."
musictheory,3c8igx,Cdesese,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"Orchestration is not covered in the Laitz. Orchestration is pretty much taught as its own topic, with its own text books (I can't help you there; perhaps there's already been a topic on orchestration texts in this or a related subreddit).  My recommendation for a solid harmony textbook would be Harmony and Voice Leading by Edward Aldwell and Carl Schachter. But this book only addresses harmony (the fourth edition adds a chapter on species counterpoint, but it's too incomplete to provide anything more than a cursory introduction to the topic). You won't find much in it on other important topics, like musical form (let alone orchestration). In this respect, the Laitz would be superior because it does include significant discussions of form and other topics.  The Piston was the standard harmony text in North America for many years, but today is considered very out of date. But being up to date might not matter to you. Another plus is that it will be cheaper than a newer text book.  You might also find Schoenberg's Fundamentals of Musical Composition appealing."
musictheory,3c7nsq,albnys,4,Sun Jul 5 17:39:58 2015 UTC,I think it's less complicated than that.    I think the keyboard is just playing Eb7 while the bass moves from Eb down to C.  Listen again and notice that chord the keyboard is playing doesn't change when the bass moves down.  Next the keys play A7 while the bass moves from A down to F# (the same thing down a tritone).    For the purposes of improvisation or harmonization it's just a measure of Eb7 then a measure of A7.    At least that's how I heard it. Cheers!

musictheory,3c6lfy,Xenoceratops,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"my bad, was typing on phone. With D I meant d major initially but I was wrong. What I ultimately mean, is that a dm chord with a c in bass would translate into c + 2 + 4 + 6, making it a sus sound. You could also call it that but imo it all depends on how far the bass is from the voicing and  how the context is. I suppose it can be used both ways, aka Stevie Wonder's Isn't she lovely, it used a Bb on Cmaj for a sus sound. But you could think of it as third inversion. You probably are classically trained, aren't you?"

musictheory,3c6lfy,LittleOmid,3,Sun Jul 5 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"It would be F#7/E. The /E indicates the bass note is an E (which, if the note is diatonic to the chord, indicates in Inversion) but the E in the melody is an Extension to the chord and needs to be notated separately."
musictheory,3c6lfy,benzo8,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:08:58 2015 UTC,"As others are saying, the note after the slash indicates the bass. You will normally interpret the chord as being in root position. Sometimes, however, the composer will have in mind a particular motion or melodic line in the bass for you to play. That will be indicated with slash chord. Usually. Series of them.   Hybrid chords: the proper terms to use are chord extensions, non chord tones (if the tone is meant to be a dissonance and not be considered part of the chord), tone cluster of the tones are major and minor 2nds apart and triad or quartal harmonies can't be identified, and polytonality if you stack two different triads on top of each other that are from different keys."
musictheory,3c6lfy,setecordas,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:27:39 2015 UTC,Same as other comments here. I usually read that as C(root)E. For example ...one way to play that on guitar would be 03201X .. Your interpretation also makes sense.
musictheory,3c6lfy,Angrycrow,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:03:37 2015 UTC,"244322   Um, is that someone's phone number?  I'm sorry, for those of us out there who don't play your instrument, could you actually spell out the chord for us?   C/E (a C major with an added E, I believe?)   C/E is a C major chord with an E in the bass.  It's not an added E, but that's only because C major already has an E.  If you had, say, C/Db, which would be a C major chord with a Db in the bass, then that Db is added because it's not already in the chord.  These are generally known as slash chords (because of the slash in the symbol).  But they're not really hybrid chords, necessarily!  They can be, but it really depends on the chord.  For example, F/G can really be considered to be a G11.  Gm/C can be considered to be a Cm9.  C/E is just C major but in first inversion.  I'd say you have an argument if you call F/G and Gm/C to be ""hybrid chords"", since, in a sense, they have two roots going on, but that's not always going to be the case.  Furthermore, ""hybrid chord"" isn't really a well-defined term in music theory.  There are such things as polychords, which are basically what you're saying, but as far as I know there's still a lot of subjectivity."
musictheory,3c40ry,Biermoese,14,Sat Jul 4 15:45:03 2015 UTC,"In he key of F, the D# is a raised 6th scale degree. Eb would be the lowered 7th.  You would spell that dominant 7th chord FACEb not FACD#.  They would sound the same, but generally speaking this type of harmony has chords spelled in 3rds."
musictheory,3c40ry,Valint,17,Sat Jul 4 16:13:56 2015 UTC,"Generally, diatonic 7th chords are interchangeable with diatonic triads. For example, Fmaj7 [F-A-C-E] functions in much the same way that an F triad does in the key of C (that is to say, as a subdominant), G7 [G-B-D-F] functions in much the same way that a G triad does in the key of C (that is to say, as a dominant).  Diatonic seventh chords include:   Major Seventh (Maj7/Δ/Δ7/M7): Built off of the tonic, and predominant in major keys, and the mediant, and submediant in minor keys - They are constructed as a major triad with a major seventh on top. Minor Seventh (min7/m7/-7): Built off of the supertonic, mediant, and submediant in major keys, and the tonic, subdominant, and dominant in minor keys - They are constructed as a minor triad with a minor seventh on top. Dominant Seventh (7): Built off of the dominant in major keys, and subtonic in minor keys, as well as the dominant in the harmonic minor scale - They are constructed as a major triad with a minor seventh on top. Diminished Seventh (dim7/°7): Built off of the raised subtonic in the harmonic minor scale - They are constructed as a diminished triad with a diminished seventh on top. As this chord has intervallic symmetry, it may be inverted freely, and is thus very useful for enharmonic modulations. Half-Diminished Seventh (Cø/Cm7♭5): Built off of the leading tone in major keys - They are constructed as a diminished triad with a minor seventh on top. Minor-Major Seventh (Cmmaj7/CmM7/CmΔ7/C-Δ7): Built off of the tonic in the harmonic minor scale - They are constructed as a minor triad with a major seventh on top. As this chord only exists diatonically in the harmonic minor scale, and the seventh of the natural minor is only rarely raised for the chord built on the tonic, this chord rarely appears. Augmented Major Seventh (Cmaj7♯5/C+M7/C+Δ7): Built off of mediant in the harmonic minor scale - They are constructed as an augmented triad with a major seventh on top. As this chord only exists diatonically in the harmonic minor scale, and the seventh of the natural minor is only rarely raised for the chord built on the mediant, this chord rarely appears.   Other seventh chords exist (such as the augmented seventh, diminished major seventh, and dominant seventh-flat five), but they do not appear diatonically, and are therefore harder to use."
musictheory,3c40ry,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:19:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! However, I don't understand the following:   For example, Fmaj7 [F-A-C-E] functions in much the same way that an F triad does in the key of C.   Fmaj7 is based off of the Tonic, right (in a major key)? So why would I treat it as a dominant? I understand it for F7, but for Fmaj7...?"
musictheory,3c40ry,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:50:27 2015 UTC,"In a major key, a maj7 chord can be built off of the tonic or the predominant diatonically, not just the tonic. In the key of C, building a seventh chord off of the subdominant (in this case, F) gives you the chord Fmaj7 (F A C E). Much like an Fmaj triad functions as a predominant chord, so too does an Fmaj7 chord."
musictheory,3c40ry,xiipaoc,4,Mon Jul 6 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"So, there are many different types of 7th chords.  The basic one is called the dominant 7th, and it's spelled 1 3 5 b7.  For example, F7 is F A C Eb.  (It's not D# because D# is the augmented 6th, not the minor 7th.)  Usually you'll find it as the V7 chord, resolving to I or i.  For example, F7 is the V7 of Bb, and it resolves to Bb major or Bb minor.  The reasons for this exactly are kind of complicated.  In any case, the dominant 7th is a major triad with a minor seventh.  The next most common types are the minor 7th, 1 b3 5 b7, and the major 7th, 1 3 5 7.  In F, Fm7 is F Ab C Eb and FM7 (or Fmaj7) is F A C E.  Unlike the dominant 7th, these chords don't really need to resolve anywhere in a jazzy context, but in a classical context they serve other functions.  The minor 7th is a minor triad with a minor seventh, and the major 7th is a major triad with a major seventh.  Then you have the diminished 7th, 1 b3 b5 bb7, and the half-diminished 7th, 1 b3 b5 b7.  In F, Fo7 (or Fdim7) is F Ab Cb Ebb and Fø7 (or Fm7b5) is F Ab Cb Eb.  Yeah, that's an E double flat.  The dim7 chord is actually just like a dominant 7th without the root!  Think about Bo7 for a second.  It's spelled B D F Ab (it's enharmonic to Fo7).  You can use a Bo7 just like a G7.  The G7 is G B D F.  It's got that same B D F, doesn't it?  So Bo7, just like G7, resolves to C -- but since it has that Ab, it's used mostly in minor.  If you see an Fo7, most likely it's resolving up a half step, to Gbm.  But notice that Fo7 has (enharmonically) the same notes as Do7, Bo7, G#o7, E#o7, etc.  So, if you're tricksy, you can use that chord to resolve someplace else!  When there's a Fo7, people will think you're resolving to Gbm.  But then you go and resolve to Cm instead -- SURPRISE!  The half-diminished 7th is a different beast, and it can sometimes work like a dominant 7th or sometimes like a predominant (the m7 and M7 are either a tonic or a predominant, but the ø7 is not good as a tonic).  There's an exotic 7th: the mM7, or minor-major seventh.  It's a minor triad with a major seventh, so it's 1 b3 5 7.  FmM7 is F Ab C E.  It sounds pretty weird and augmented, because of the augmented 5th between the b3 and the 7.  It doesn't have any standard uses, but you can figure out neat things to do with it if you want an ugly sound.  It's good as a final chord, if you like that sort of thing.  Finally, there are other 7th chords that are basically just alterations on other chords.  For example, there's the F7b5, F A Cb Eb.  You'll more often find this chord as an augmented 6th chord, not a 7th chord: the French aug6, Fr+6.  In F, it would be F A B D# (yep, that's a D#).  These chords resolve outward, usually, so the F will resolve down to E and the D# will resolve up to E.  The B stays put and the A goes to G#, so you get an E major chord.  Obviously you can so all sorts of other things instead, but that's one of the standard resolutions.  There's also the F7#5 (or sometimes F+7), which is a dominant 7th chord with an augmented triad.  F7#5 would be F A C# Eb.  I've seen F7/6 as well, which has an added 6th: F A C D Eb.  You wouldn't usually voice it this way, since the D and Eb kinda clash.  A good way is to skip the 5th and play F Eb A D.  The thing is, both of these chords, the F7#5 and F7/6, are probably better written as 13th chords: F7b13 (so there's a b13 or b6 instead of #5) and F13.  You can also add other notes to 7th chords -- F7b9, F7#11, whatever you want to do.  You can do anything, literally!"
musictheory,3c40ry,ghick,4,Sat Jul 4 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"There are some great comments here explaining 7th chords.  Although, I can understand how some of these comments may be a bit of information overload and take a while to digest.   I'm going to try my best to make a simplified version of 7th chords.  Ok, think of Chord symbols as a recipe of notes.   These recipes are telling you what notes of a scale to play.    The very basic foundation of chords is the Triad.  Keeping things simple, let's just focus on 2 triads, Major and Minor.    Major triads contain the 1-3-5 of the major scale. Minor triads contain the 1-3b-5 of the major scale.  Going back to the recipe analogy, think of the Triad as the basic Cake you want to make.  Vanilla cake (Major) or Chocolate cake (minor)  7th chords along with 9th, 11th, and 13th chords are basically Chord extensions. These extensions don't change what kind of triad (cake) you have.  Think of extensions like icing on the cake.  For example, a minor triad still functions as a minor chord regardless of whether it has a 7th, or 9th extension on it.  Or in other words, a Chocolate cake is still a chocolate cake whether it has strawberry icing or mint icing.  So go ahead and put a 7 on top of a major triad.  you have a major 7th.  Same cake, different icing.  Same goes for putting the 7b on top of the minor triad, same cake, different icing.     Dominate 7ths can be a bit confusing when first trying to understand them.  The recipe for a Dominate 7th is a major triad (1-3-5) with a 7b on top.  Why the 7b?  Because the 7b creates this tension called a tritone that wants to pull to the I chord.  Because of this, Dominate 7ths should be considered a separate type of cake.  I dunno... Coconut cake.  So, the recipe for this new cake (dominate 7th) is 1-3-5-7b, yes, you can put extensions on top of this one -- 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths -- and it still functions like a dominate 7th or Coconut cake  if you will.   Long story short.  Major Triad + 7, 9, 11, 13 = Major 7th, 9th, 11th, or 13th ......  notated as CMAJ7, CΔ13  Minor Triad + b7, 9, 11, 13 = minor 7th, 9th, 11th, or 13th ....  notated as Cmin7, C-13  Major Triad and 7b + 9th, 11th, or 13th = Dominate 7th, 9th, 11th, or 13th. ... notated as C7, Cdom13  Hope that helps...  Oh and stay away from Major 11 and Dom 11 chords right now.  Probably won't sound good to you and for good reason."
musictheory,3c40ry,gloryian,6,Sun Jul 5 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"| Now I can add either the great seventh or the small seventh  We call those the major seventh and the minor seventh. The first chord (with the major 7th) is called a major 7th chord, or maj7, in this case Fmaj7. The second chord is called a dominant 7th chord, usually denoted by adding a 7 after the chord letter (in this case F7). Hope that helps!"
musictheory,3c40ry,ARCJols,3,Sat Jul 4 15:59:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! That helped. Further question: E is part of the Fmaj diatonic scale while Eb is not. What does that mean for the major and the minor seventh?
musictheory,3c40ry,goodboy2910,4,Sat Jul 4 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"Alright. It means that generally, you won't be able to use F7 in the F key. If you are playing in the key of F, and want to use the F chord with a seventh, it would be the one with the major seventh, Fmaj7.   On the other hand every dominant seventh chord works as the leading V7 to a I in any given key. So, normally, a V7 solves into what would be the fourth degree of the chord. For example, F7 is F A C Eb, as we are in F, the fourth degree of F is Bb, so an F7 should resolve into a Bb"
musictheory,3c40ry,ARCJols,2,Sat Jul 4 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""the leading V7 to a I""? Like, what does leading mean?"
musictheory,3c40ry,ghick,2,Sun Jul 5 05:18:32 2015 UTC,"I may not be exactly on point with my definitions, but to ""lead"" is to take something from one point to another, so musically, almost every chord has a function, to lead something into something, and on these relations of things leading to others, we creat chord progressions.   Now, generally, when creating a piece, by diverse methods, you create tension,  just like in a story, and the equivalent of a story ending in music, is resolving to the tonic, that is, ending on the chord of the I degree of the scale being used for the piece. There is a long explanation, which I can go into, but simply put, given the structure of a major dominant seventh chord, it helps resolve a piece. In any given major scale, the major dominant seventh chord is the fifth, so the fifth (V) with a dominant seventh (V7), resolves perfectly into the I chord.   Just to experience it, play a progression in C, say C - Am - Em - F - G7 ...and stop there. After the G7 you will get the feel that it is cut off, or it hasn't quite finished, and that feeling is the fact that it hasn't resolved. Leading here is the fact that given the relations of the tones in those chords, a V7 leads to a I, that is, after a V7 it is expected a I."
musictheory,3c40ry,xiipaoc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"Music is sound.  So play the V7 - I to hear what leading is.  This will be a much better explanation than any text.    For example, play C-F-C-G7-C.  Listen.  Now play C-F-C-G7.  Listen.  Something bothering you?  Feel unresolved.  Feel like something is 'leading' you to go somewhere?  That somewhere is the C.    This is leading."

musictheory,3c40ry,Superfarmer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:47:22 2015 UTC,Gotcha - the interval of a major 7th vs minor 7th. F-Eb is a minor 7th. Just want to make sure the OP didn't think F-A-C-Eb was a minor 7th chord.
musictheory,3c40ry,ghick,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:43:53 2015 UTC,I also have struggled with understanding this concept.  Why is it called the minor 7th?  Isn't the minor scale only a flatted 3rd?
musictheory,3c40ry,ShiaLaBuff,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"I also have struggled with understanding this concept. Why is it called the minor 7th?   First.  you have to define 'it.'  Are we talking about a chord or an interval?  Minor seventh can mean either the Minor 7 chord or the Minor 7 interval.  Minor 7 chord is a minor triad (1-3b-5) with a 7b. For example, Am7 = 1-3b-5-7b = A-C-E-G  On the other hand, you can use the term minor seventh to define an interval (i.e. a single note). In this case, a minor seventh is a 7b. So, a minor seventh interval in the Key of C is Bb.  But really, folks will more likely call the interval a flat 7 instead of a minor 7.  On the flip side, folks will say minor third way more often than flat 3.  But in the end, these all mean the same thing."
musictheory,3c48co,edlikesrush,8,Sat Jul 4 16:55:23 2015 UTC,"The song is mainly in 4/4, but the bass's loud ""downbeats"" are deceptive. They're a half beat early each time. Instead of hitting on beat 1 of the bar you'd expect they hit on the second half of beat 4 of the previous bar. That syncopation is probably what's confusing.  If you want to pick up the true beat don't listen to the bass, listen to the snare drum. It hits on the 2 and 4 of every bar.  The riff that starts at 1:50 is also in 4/4 but there are occasional dropped beats. Every eight bars there's a dropped beat in the last measure: 4/4, 4/4, 4/4, 4/4; then 4/4, 4/4, 4/4, 3/4.  At 3:30 it goes back to straight 4/4, but again with the strong hits a half beat early.  Finally at 4:15 the intro ends with a couple bars of straight 3/4.

musictheory,3c48co,jkugelman,3,Sat Jul 4 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"This is called ""anticipation"". It's quite common in jazz. When you anticipate the next downbeat by playing it half a beat early. When it's not doubled with the kick it's called ""flam"" and almost sounds like a mistake."

musictheory,3c46i4,Killian3494,3,Sat Jul 4 18:49:46 2015 UTC,"OP can research the harmonic and melodic minor for more information on this. The short version is that the A natural minor key contains the same notes as (is diatonic with) the C major key. However, raising the 7th degree 1/2 tone creates pleasant voice leading back to the root, so minor keys are often played with a raised 7th degree. This is called the harmonic minor. Since harmonic minor is so commonly incorporated into a minor tonality, it's often the case that a song in ""A minor"" will not be strictly diatonic with a song in C major."

One is different from the other because one is in A minor, and the other is in C major.   What that means, is that what sounds like ""lowest"" note, is A, in A minor, and C in C major. By virtue of playing the notes differently, they appear to have different sort of sounds, different roles.   It's like, ""if a sandwich, is bread and coldcuts, then what's the difference between a bread sandwich and a coldcut sandwich?"" well in one, the coldcuts sandwich the bread in the middle, and in the other, it's the opposite.   If you actually want to better understand it, you need to learn the difference by sound, by playing lots of examples. Music is sound, and can only be understood by sound. It can't really be found from reading  words on a page."

musictheory,3c3ngu,BatmanAndRobert,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:38:05 2015 UTC,I see. So are there rules about when and how should do this? So far it seems like in IV case especially it's very popular in modern pop music.
musictheory,3c3ngu,BatmanAndRobert,3,Sat Jul 4 14:36:34 2015 UTC,"If you're sticking to 18th century counterpoint, the rules would basically stay the same. As in, any location a IV could go, a iv could replace it. This is particularly more common in later romantic music.  However, you've described a motion of iv to IV, which is less common, especially when in a minor key already. If you were to abide by 18th century practices, you'd usually borrow the minor iv while in a major key."
musictheory,3c3ngu,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it doesn't sound very 18th century to me. It's that 21st century indie sound that uses a minor scale with a lot of alternation between I, IV and VI in whatever order that doesn't sound as minor scale as it is due to that major IV chord."
musictheory,3c3ngu,OPisAfaq,3,Sat Jul 4 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"Just to add onto this, a IV chord in a minor scale could also be functioning as a secondary dominant of the subtonic (V/VII)."
musictheory,3c3ngu,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt that's its role because it's usually a IVMaj7 rather than a IV7, and also it rarely solves to the subtonic."
musictheory,3c3ngu,deanolivet,2,Sat Jul 4 15:29:27 2015 UTC,"If it's a IVmaj7 then you're also raising the third of the scale. If it were just a major IV it could also be a secondary dominant, like they were saying."
musictheory,3c3ngu,arhombus,2,Sat Jul 4 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"I said that it could be functioning this way, not that it must. Obviously, if the mediant is raised, or if it doesn't resolve to either the subtonic, a dominant-prolongation within the subtonic (and then onwards to the subtonic), or deceptively to vi/VII, bVI/VII, or N6/VII then it clearly isn't functioning that way; but that does not discount the fact that it often is used that way."
musictheory,3c3ngu,ghick,2,Sat Jul 4 18:37:56 2015 UTC,It's also common/fitting because the raised 6^ required for the IV is found in the melodic minor and Dorian scales... So that's another thought on the matter.

musictheory,3c3hxp,korben_manzarek,7,Sat Jul 4 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"You can't really learn the sound of a specific chord, as in D major versus C major or Bb major, but you can learn to recognize different chord qualities.   What you could do is arpeggiate the chords, and focus very much on the individual intervals that make them up. Then play the chord. Arpeggiate again. Play the chord again. This should give you more time and should allow you to hear all the individual intervals when playing the entire chord, too.  Keep with it, ear training can take ages and the beginning is so confusing. But it's like a new language, after a while it just becomes something you understand upon hearing, like the word 'tree' invoking an image or association corresponding to the concept 'tree' right away.  Speaking of this, associations are a good way to deal with chord qualities. Play different intervals and assign feelings to them. For instance, a maj7 chord sounds 'mystical' to me, while a min7 chord sounds moody but angrier than a normal min chord. A dominant chord to me stands out due to the increased dissonance which makes it sound more like a jerk. min(maj7) makes me feel 'uneasy, 'tense'.  You must come up with your own associations but I promise you this will be helpful."
musictheory,3c3hxp,QuickestDickAround,6,Sat Jul 4 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"It's useful to think of the more complex sonorities as alterations of the simpler ones: Memorise what major and minor sound like, then think of augmented as simply a major chord with the fifth raised, and diminished as a minor chord with the fifth flattened. Once you've got that down, move on to seventh chords: Think of Maj7 as a major chord with a major seventh, 7 as a major chord with a minor seventh, m(maj7) as a minor chord with a major seventh, min7 as a minor chord with a minor seventh. Once you've got that down, try thinking of a m7(b5) chord as a diminished chord with a minor seventh, a dim7 as a diminished chord with a diminished seventh, an aug7 as an augmented chord with a minor seventh. You get the idea."
musictheory,3c3hxp,MiskyWilkshake,3,Sat Jul 4 15:22:01 2015 UTC,"My humble suggestion is to learn what chords sound like in relation to the key they appear in, rather than as stand-alone chords. Their function, i.e. how they relate to the current key, is what determines what they sound like.  For example, in the key of D minor, the Dm chord has the ""i"" function and feels ""at home"", because it is the tonic, and it has its typical minor sound. In the key of C major, the same Dm chord is now the ""ii"" chord and will sound differently. In fact, before I learnt to recognise it as ""the ii chord of a major scale"", I had trouble even hearing if it was a major or minor chord.  A method for learning this would be to play songs from sheets with chord symbols."
musictheory,3c3hxp,Bromskloss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:38:21 2015 UTC,"First learn to recognize intervals.  Next, learn to hear the difference between major and minor scales.  After that, get really good at distinguishing between major and minor triads (the simplest chords).  Then, add in diminished and augmented triads.  Finally, do 7th chords.  Now learn any other miscellaneous chords.  This is probably the easiest order to do it in, and has been working well for me so far.  Definitely do intervals before anything else though.  Scales likely won't take long after you know intervals."
musictheory,3c3hxp,TNUGS,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"I would suggest if you want to learn the key of D, do not make all of the chords D variation because this isn't in key, instead practice what's called a ""chord scale"" derived from the scale whose feelings/color you wish to express. Here's major:  I      ii     iii     IV    V      vi    vii     VIII/I  Maj  min min  Maj  Dom min  Dim  Maj(Octave)  So you could practice in the key of D, by playing:  Dmaj7 | Emin7 | F#min7 | Gmaj 7 | A7 | Bmin7 | C#dim7 | Dmaj7  Now, if you brush up on chord substitutions, all of the altered chords can replace certain chords from this chord scale, similar to what /u/MiskyWilkshake already pointed out. IMO this is a more comprehensible way to digest what purpose the chords serve. That way you aren't thinking ""oh, a suspended sounds this way"" you are thinking of how they resolve and where they point in the scale.  edit: sorry idk how to make this formatting less awful haha. When I typed it all the Roman numerals lined up with the chord."

Then start with 4 tone chords, -7, maj7, half diminished and dominant 7. Then start adding 6th chords and minor major and full diminished. First try to determine if something is minor or major via intervals and sound color, then go from there and try to sing every interval you hear in chord and figure it out."
musictheory,3c3hxp,LittleOmid,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:34:43 2015 UTC,"it's better to learn how to spell chords by harmonizing scales, preferably the major scale.

musictheory,3c3hxp,Alejandro4891,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:47:04 2015 UTC,Go over to musictheory.net and start practicing. Find specific things you hear or feel when you listen to a chord. Like when you hear a D7 it tugs towards another chord (being G major) or when you hear Dm7 it sounds like the beginning of a ii V I progression (in C). Good luck!

musictheory,3c0ut1,TheChurchofHelix,10,Sat Jul 4 07:17:44 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, I don't know if I agree with you there. Time signature changes, polyrhythmia, and atypical chord progressions have been around for a while now. Prog doesn't bring anything to the table that makes it different from other modern genres of art music.  A whole lot of prog falls into slight variations on the old, tried-and-true verse-chorus form, with extended instrumental interludes and bridges. Even more ""out-there"" ""innovative"" bands like Unexpect (avant-garde), Code Orange Kids (crust punk derivation) or Fallujah (tech death derivation) are still pretty reliant on standard rock tropes.   Prog very well may be musically progressive compared to the often repetitive genre that is rock n' roll, but is absolutely not ""progressive"" compared to all music as a whole. Progressive rock is as much a derivative genre as any other. I'm not saying its bad. I'm just saying that there is no reason why there needs to be a sub for the specific music theory behind the composition of art rock. It's not like prog exclusively uses 32-note scales and a base 3 rhythmic system.  Take note, I'm saying this as a long-time lover of prog and extreme metal, so I'm not just trying to be disagreeable snarky for snark's sake. I love well-composed popular music as much as anybody else."

That's why it's called progressive rock and not just progressive genre.    You ever heard of progressive jazz fusion? Neither have I. Because that term is redundant. Progressive is almost a synonym for avant-garde or art, I think. And certainly around the 60's/70's progressive rock was just that."

Progressive jazz fusion   That'd be free jazz. Plenty of that around.    Progressive is a synonym for avant-garde or art   Yes, you're absolutely right! Though, I would say more art and less avant-garde. Avant-garde implies innovation, which a lot of prog just doesn't do these days. In the 60s and 70s; yes, absolutely. In the 80s, you had the thrash movement, which was extremely progressive. The 90s and early 00s were the golden age of death metal, so that was pretty progressive. Now in the 10s, prog is pretty stagnant, prog and tech death are self-indulgent as hell, and formulaic djent and core subgenres are very popular. None of those are actually very progressive. You see snippits of innovation here and there, but not much. What I'd call truly progressive today would be the polystylistic classical scene. That's a pretty big deal right now, and there's a lot of really great music coming out of it."

musictheory,3c2dnp,Xenoceratops,4,Sat Jul 4 06:30:06 2015 UTC,why do minors chords have ♭ in them?
musictheory,3c2dnp,GoHangMusic,5,Sat Jul 4 05:33:47 2015 UTC,"it indicates that the degree of the scale is flattened, upon which a major chord is stacked (when the roman numerals are capitalized)  ♭III = a major chord constructed with the minor third of the scale as the root  I tried my best not to make my explanation confusing. hopefully it helps."
musictheory,3c2dnp,Xenoceratops,6,Sat Jul 4 06:27:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. It relates to scale degrees. Take a C major scale:   C D E F G A B   If we wanted to express the scale degrees as numerals, we would use 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.  Now look at a C minor scale:   C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭   Or 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7. We use ""♭"" or ""#"" in front of the number to indicate that it is raised or lowered when compared to its parallel major scale. This can be applied to chords as well. Staying in C, ""vi"" indicates a minor chord built on the sixth degree, A. So the chord is Am. ""♭VI"" shows that the chord is still built on the sixth degree of the scale, but it is the flattened sixth degree, which is A♭.  ""♭"" does note necessarily indicate that the note name of the chord is going to be some sort of ♭, just that it is lowered in relation to the major scale that shares the same key note. For example, compare E major and E minor:   E major: E F# G# A B C# D# = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  E minor: E F# G A B C D = 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7   ""6"" in E is C#, ""♭6"" is C.  Now then, when we use minor keys, we tend to make chromatic alterations here and there to facilitate chord progressions. A particularly common alteration changes ♭7 back to 7. This produces the harmonic minor scale.   C natural minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭ = 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 ♭7  C harmonic minor: C D E♭ F G A♭ B = 1 2 ♭3 4 5 ♭6 7   This means that we can build minor scale chords off of both of those scales and use them interchangeably.   C natural minor: i ii° ♭III iv v ♭VI ♭VII  C harmonic minor: i ii° ♭III+ iv V ♭VI vii°   (♭III+ is rarely used, although it inverts to become V+, which is a bit more common.)"
musictheory,3c2dnp,Bossman010,2,Sat Jul 4 06:44:01 2015 UTC,thanks for a very clear explanation. Trying to wrap my head around it. Why is the vii° diminished in harmonic minor?
musictheory,3c2dnp,Xenoceratops,3,Sat Jul 4 12:00:28 2015 UTC,"Chord qualities are determined by stacking notes from the scale at the interval of a third. So, in C minor, the chord built off of 7 contains the notes B, D, and F. This spells a diminished triad.  If you add another third on top of that, you get the seventh chord built on that scale degree, B D F A♭. This is vii°7 (""seven fully-diminished seventh""). This chord is different from what it would be in the major mode. In C major, following the same procedure yields B D F A, or viiø7 (""seven half-diminished seventh""). Different scale, different notes, different chord quality.  Hope that clears things up."

musictheory,3c2dnp,nothisisme,3,Sat Jul 4 07:22:02 2015 UTC,"The ii° is the vii° from the relative major. It's the same chord, so also diminished, just in a different context."
musictheory,3c2dnp,positivemusic,3,Sat Jul 4 07:46:50 2015 UTC,"The fifth of the supertonic (the chord that has the second scale degree as its root) is a sixth from the tonic. In aeolian (natural minor), the sixth is flattened, so the the supertonic has a diminished (flat) fifth. The perfect fifth does not appear in the key.  In Dorian (also a minor scale), the sixth is not flattened so the supertonic is ii.  For example, in A minor a fifth from b gives us f#, but f# is not in a minor. So f it is, yielding b (half) diminished."

musictheory,3c2dnp,xiipaoc,2,Sat Jul 4 15:57:07 2015 UTC,"The flattened chords refer to the first note, not the third. The third decides whether a triad is major or minor, but the first note decides if it is flattened from the parallel major scale (starting on the same note).  The first chord of ""A major"" and ""A minor"" is an an A. However the third scale degree in major is #C, but C in minor. Therefore, a triad (i.e. ♭III) that starts on the third degree of the minor scale would be starting on a flattened note (C instead of C# from the major scale). The first note is what's relevant for this concept, not the quality of the triad (major/minor, decided by the third)."

musictheory,3c0ao7,JSW2K7,52,Fri Jul 3 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"You may be interested in the Partimento tradition. This tradition privileges improvisation as the central musical value. It was developed for use in the Neapolitan conservatories in the early 18th century, and remains an essential training tool in the Paris Conservatory.   Here's an example of a young girl who has been trained in the Partimento tradition improvising with her Partimento teacher.   How does it work? As a student in a Neapolitan conservatory, you spent your day, from dawn until dusk, working with: this, a baseline, with or without figures. Your job was to use that bassline like a ""blueprint"" for the realization of an entire piece. You would learn chordal and melodic formulae that ""fit"" over a given bass line to accomplish this task.   So to start, you'd learn the basic formulae. You'd begin learning The Rule of the Octave, learning the three appropriate voicing patterns in the right hand in every key see here for the FB for the three positions of the right hand (note: unlike normal figured bass, these figures actually tell you how to voice the chord in the right hand, so 3/8/5 tells you ""third on top, root below that, and fifth below that"") . After this, you learned cadential formulae. Many partimenti are completable using only the Rule of the Octave and Cadences, such as these beginner Partimenti. You then learned appropriate sequences. (Side note: I still have zero clue what the hell this example is, it's bizzarre). This completed your basic training: it gave you all the materials you would need to start realizing real Partimenti.   You'd then just start working things through. You'd have a book of bass lines that looked something like this. As a beginner, you'd start by just copying and pasting block chords, giving you a very ""plunky"" but satisfying result. Over time, you'd gradually come to know the more interesting melodic formulae that can link up with a bass line, either through intuition, gentle nudges or suggestions in the Partimento itself, or by becoming intimately acquainted with the vocal-oriented Solfeggi, which focused on bass/melody pairs and were used to train singers.   The important thing was to go beyond mere ""correctness"" and uncover voicings and figuration that were satisfying and tasteful. By the end of your training, you were capable of improvising a full-blown piece such as this, or even a fugue.   Galant composers trained every day at this from the time they were about 7 until they were 21. And they came out capable of writing stuff like this. It taught them not only how to appropriately flesh out a bass line into a lush fabric, but also taught them what bass lines were appropriate for where. Need a minuet? No problem! Just take the opening gambit from one partimenti, continue it with a modulation gesture from another, throw in a cool modally mixed thing you worked on last August, then stamp on a cadence. Bam! You had the first half of a minuet ready to go in minutes!   This is exactly what Alma is doing in the video I posted, her teacher plays a set of gestures that she recognizes. She knows what might come next. So she plays that and fills it out appropriately, after which her teacher responds.   And you can do this to! I've found that working through Partimenti is immensely satisfying and has really helped me get to know the language of the 18th century better than just about anything else.   Here are some resources:   Robert Gjerdingen, Monuments of Partimenti, where you can go to print off Partimenti for yourself! I recommend beginning with this set, work your way very slowly starting with the ""rules"" set until you are artistically satisfied with each exercise.  Giorgio Sanguinetti, The Art of Partimento., which goes over how to work with Partimenti in more detail."

What's going on in that example is almost exactly what we have in that partimento. The main difference is that the sonority is just 64 and not 642. But I think we can treat 64 and 642, both with augmented fourths, as more or less interchangeable (in fact, Bach treats them as such). If we do, then these would be ""passing 642s"" in which the bass does not move down by step."

musictheory,3c0ao7,nmitchell076,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:24:37 2015 UTC,"A good question that unfortunately goes a bit beyond my knowledge. I think the Parisian tradition is largely inherited directly from the Neapolitan one. I think many aspects of the Paris Conservatory are inherited from Naples. Training in Naples would have begun at an exceedingly young age, however (around 7), whereas I believe training in Paris began much later in life, approaching more of what we think of as a typical college student age (though I'm not entirely sure on this point). Another difference is that Paris would use these things as musicianship tests. So to graduate you had to demonstrate your abilities in a Partimento exam. The best resulting composition often won some cash prize. In Naples, on the other hand, I don't believe such a thing existed, you just trained until you were unleashed upon the world.   But though the age and some usages of Partimenti were slightly different, I believe the content and purpose of the exercises were largely the same.   As for the he German tradition, you've got me. I'm not aware of anything about that tradition whatsoever.   Take all this with a grain of salt, I'm more well-versed on the Italian tradition than anything else."

After some level of establishing those relationships in your head, it's perfectly possible to use fixed-do (especially chromatic variants) while still feeling those tendency tones and functions.   It just makes your vocabulary much more flexible. Solfege is also used as a concentration tool and fluency/mnemonics for note reading. Letter names don't work nearly as well for that.    For instrumentalists fixed-do is much better for real time processing because it allows you to combine audiation with that concentration/fluency tool.    Another advantage, especially with chromatic variants, is that being able to audiate tonal relationships using different syllable patterns makes you far more flexible, which is necessary for complex music, and fights against ""C major"" bias."

To take that a step further since I think that's actually what you're asking, G C F with G as the root would be G7sus4 that just happens to not have a 5th in the chord."
musictheory,3c0ww6,saxguy2001,3,Fri Jul 3 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"You could call all three chords (CFG, FGC, GCF) Csus4 chords. It's just that, for FGC, you would have to notate it as an inversion, Csus4/F, and GCF as Csus4/G.  As you mentioned though, FGC has a shorter name, Fsus2, which is equivalent to Csus4/F. It's just another way of writing it.  GCF has no such shorter way of writing it. However, as the previous commenter mentioned, it could be a seventh chord omitting the fifth (which is not at all uncommon to do). If that was the case, the GCF would fully be GCDF (with an implied D note, the fifth). In which case, now you have a Gsus4 with a minor seventh, so it's a G7sus4.  Whether you call the GCF chord Csus4/G or G7sus4 depends on context. If the F note in that chord resolves to an E note, or more specifically, a C major chord (GCE), you almost certainly have a Csus4/G, because the suspension often implies a resolution, which in this case would be the C major chord. If however a different note in the GCF chord, the C note, actually resolves to a B note, it sounds like you're resolving from Gsus4 to G major (GCD to GBD). The same idea works for seventh chords. So if the progression is GCDF -> GBDF, you most likely got a G7sus4 chord. Hope that helps! It depends on context and what the suspended chord is resolving to."

As a generalization, I think anger is a very primitive feeling we all experience.  When I think about representing that musically I think a couple things.  Maybe they can help you, they are just my opinion!   Rhythm-  I like syncopation working against a driving pulse.  I like the feeling of unresolved rhythmic tension, even if its just a simple dotted quarter pattern in 4/4.  Contrasting that, I think quick bursts can give a sense of the various bursts in anger. Melody-I typically think of a dynamic between big, strong (primitive, in a sense) sounding intervals like 4ths and 5ths and dissonance like tritones and minor seconds. Harmony-I definitely think minor.  I like one steady tonic note and I think the harmony can help convey the narrative of the anger, depending on if the piece moves from harmonic minor, natural minor, phrygian etc to being totally atonal.   Again these are just my opinions on what sounds angry to me.  To give context, when I think of a range of angry music I think of Meshuggah, the loud passages of The Rite of Spring, and some Free Jazz."

Rhythm, drive, instrumentation, timbre (distortion!) become the fuel of the song. It's all attitude as opposed to composition. Keep it simple.  Arrangement is still importand, though. As someone else has mentioned, repetition is good. Just as an example, increasing intensity with each repeat, leaving it hanging on a climax and then breaking it down (like changing one or more elements to a halftime rhythm for example) is very effective.   Depending on what you want to do, maybe think about dynamics and how they can provide contrast to the aggressive feel of the music. Letting something breathe just to bring it back even harder... you get the idea - same concept as my arrangement example, but executed differently."
musictheory,3bw6q5,CedricTheAlarmist,2,Thu Jul 2 20:11:26 2015 UTC,I was going to say the same thing.  I find it to be less about the 'what' I play and more about the 'how' it is played.  If you watch the movie deliverance - the music is basically all the same song (the hillbilly anthem) but played in completely different ways to make it give totally different emotions.  My favorite was when Burt Reynolds goes over the waterfall and it's completely frantic.    Same chords and notes.  Way different feel.
musictheory,3bw6q5,lifeisdream,3,Fri Jul 3 02:02:26 2015 UTC,"Angry dance pieces usually have a rad bass beat (I'm assuming you mean pop dance), but sound cheesy due to trite chord progressions. To make it sound really disgusting/ vigorous, without sounding ingenuine, try using the tritone on your bass line. Generally speaking, going from your tritone to your perfect fourth sounds badass.  So, if you were on C minor, play a simple octave bassline rhythm on 4/4 time (e.g. C@0-C@1-C@0-C@1, etc). Then the line would go C-Gb-F-Eb.   You'd need a pretty catchy phrase-long (2 measures) melodic motif. Try using the notes of the blues scale (on C, C-Eb-F-F#-G-Bb-(Bnat)-C). Use syncopation sparingly"

musictheory,3bw6q5,remydc,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"With the right punch, I feel like triple over double sounds angry.   Rage Against the Machine - Killing in the Name Of is a good example 30 seconds in. http://youtu.be/bWXazVhlyxQ  I actually feel that Rage has a lot of examples of angry sounding music (Bulls on Parade, Guerrilla Radio, Sleep Now in the Fire...to name a few). As several others have mentioned, they have a solid grasp on syncopation. To me, syncopation is to rhythm as dissonance is to melody(at least in Western music)...it doesn't feel natural and can cause feelings of unease and discomfort. That can certainly be conveyed or interpreted as anger.   Also, with Sleep Now in the Fire ( http://youtu.be/3L4YrGaR8E4), there is that HEAVY octave riff. It resonates in your core.  The intent of angry music, as I interpret it, isn't to create anger, but to release it, for both composer and listener. The suggestion of writing when you're angry/upset/frustrated is great because those emotions pour out onto the page. Writing music is great catharsis. My Composition professor in college was a very big proponent of 'write what you feel' and impressed upon us that release of emotions.

The emotion can go so deep and stem from sadness, bitterness, fear, etc.   Anyone can make things loud and yell and be ""angry"" But real dark anger festers and lingers in sometimes the most subtle, damaging ways.   I've heard some songs that weren't necessarily angry at face value, but once it really sank in, I'd get the chills from the visceral darkness in them."
musictheory,3bw6q5,maxoreilly,2,Thu Jul 2 22:13:18 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite parts about angry music is that, almost by design, it should rely on the most basic rules of music theory. The emotion they you're trying to portray is far too fundamental and elemental on a human level for it to not also be fundamental and elemental on a musical level.  With this in mind, I feel that angry music (including the best and most famous phrases of angry music) are harmonically simple, with lots of simple chord progressions and instances of tension-resolution. Beethoven's pathetique sonata is a good example of this. Literally the opening phrase is just a series of tritones which immediately resolve.  Angry music can also be harmonically dense and messy, mirroring the flood of emotions and haziness that is associated with anger. A great example of that is Rachmoninoff's Symphonic Dances, especially movement 1. There are a lot of instances of what are essentially tone clusters that don't really sound like anything except as provided by the timbre of the instruments producing the notes.  tl;dr Don't worry if it seems incredibly simple and therefore cheesy. Simple is good, simple is powerful in this case. To your point, though, the melody itself does have to have substance. But finding a good melody is always the challenge!"

musictheory,3by3jq,Ghostofhan,13,Fri Jul 3 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"You've got a good point! It certainly would be possible to have major/minor fourths and fifths. However, there are a few things about fourths/fifths that are special:   A perfect fourth/fifth is basically a consonance, whereas +4 or -5 is a dissonance. This isn't true for other intervals, where being major/minor doesn't fundamentally change a consonance to a dissonance or vice versa. A diminished fifth is the same size (basically) as an augmented fourth. Again, we never see a similar situation with major/minor intervals. (A minor third is always bigger than a major second.) It's only with other dim/aug intervals that you get enharmonic equivalence: a diminished seventh = a major sixth, for example. Other intervals have a relatively even major/minor distribution, whereas for fourths/fifths there's only one odd interval out. That's not a black & white distinction but it's still a pretty important one. Ultimately, the major scale is built out of stacking perfect fifths. That's the fundamental structure of the scale, so treating fifths as ""perfect"" recognizes their special status (alongside the octave, which is another basic assumption about how music & scales work). Perfect fifths and fourths use the frequency ratio of 3:2 and 4:3, which are treated as special by very many musical styles & cultures. Not as many as the octave (whose ratio is 2:1) but more than any other frequency ratio (such as the just major third, which is 5:4). Again, the distinction isn't purely black & white, but you can see how fifths/fourths could plausibly be grouped with either category... the preponderance of considerations seems to favor treating them as more like octaves and less like thirds. (This also follows the practice of tonal counterpoint, which requires you to treat fifths/octaves differently from sixths/thirds.)"
musictheory,3by3jq,vornska,5,Fri Jul 3 03:13:34 2015 UTC,"Are there situations where it's required to say ""diminished seventh"" instead of major sixth? Like the way it's sometimes required to say B#?   Yes. The interval from C to A is a major sixth. The interval from B# to A is a diminished seventh.    I've literally never even heard an interval besides 5th and 4th described as augmented or diminished and I can't really think of a reason to do so.   Other common diminished intervals are diminished sevenths (e.g., B-Ab), fourths (e.g., B-Eb), and thirds (e.g., B-Db). Other common augmented intervals are augmented seconds (e.g., C-D#) and sixths (e.g., C-A#). All of these intervals have important roles to play in music, usually as part of particular kinds of chordal or scalar structures."
musictheory,3by3jq,Cdesese,5,Fri Jul 3 03:41:56 2015 UTC,"In a fully diminished 7th chord, I'd say it has a diminished 7th on it, not a major 6th."

B D F Ab   They're really distinctive sounding and start to become common especially after Bach.  The reason why you say ""diminished 7th"" instead of ""major 6th"" is to do with the spelling of the interval. B to G# is a major 6th. B to Ab is your diminished 7th. The pitches are identical but their harmonic functions aren't, and the reason is the same as why you'd say B# sometimes."

They can only remain consonant whilst perfect.  Major and minor intervals can always be diminished or augmented into another consonant interval (major diminishes to minor; minor augments to major).   There is no such thing as an ""imperfect"" interval. At least, I've never heard of one described in this way.  I hope this helps."

Out of interest, is imperfect used to describe 2nds and 7ths as well, in any quality? And are aug/dim 3rds and 6ths imperfect?   I'd be really interested in learning more about this terminology, as it never came up during my degree. I'm aware that this is probably taught differently in other countries."
musictheory,3by3jq,handsomebrit,3,Fri Jul 3 09:08:52 2015 UTC,"""Perfect"" and ""imperfect"" are traditional categories for describing consonant intervals. The perfect consonances--unison, fourth, fifth, and octave--were so called because they were understood to represent the most pure consonances, with the simplest ratios. And for a long time in Western music (up until at least the 14th century), only perfect consonances were considered true consonances, and even thirds and sixths were treated as dissonances. But then by around the 15th century, thirds and sixths start to become accepted as consonances as more music starts to treat them as such. By the 16th century, the theorist Zarlino admits thirds and sixths as consonances. But thirds and sixths are still considered less consonant than the perfect consonances, and so they are called ""imperfect."" This terminology reflected how musicians at the time understood harmonic progression: for example, in a cadence, two voices forming a major sixth or minor third progress in stepwise contrary motion to an octave or unison--imperfection moves toward perfection, an idea that had roots all the way back in ancient Greek music theory and philosophy.  So, ""imperfect"" is a term traditionally applied to major and minor thirds and sixths, which are regarded as consonant, to distinguish them from the perfect consonances.  Dissonant intervals are not imperfect, they are dissonant, and so all seconds and sevenths are not imperfect. And since any diminished or augmented interval is automatically dissonant, augmented or diminished thirds or sixths are not imperfect either. Only major and minor thirds and sixths are imperfect."
musictheory,3by3jq,Cdesese,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:13:25 2015 UTC,"Brilliant. Thanks. I'd learned it pretty much exactly as you described, using the term ""partial consonance"" for ""imperfect"" in things like species counterpoint (and then following the irrelevance of the term post-Zarlino).

musictheory,3by3jq,xiipaoc,3,Sat Jul 4 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"""Perfect"" just means that it hasn't been diminished or augmented.  ""Major"" just means it's bigger.  ""Minor"" just means that it's smaller.  So you have two kinds of ""normal"" thirds: the big one (major) and the small one (minor).  You have two kinds of ""normal"" seconds too: the big one (major) and the small one (minor).  But there's just one kind of normal fourth and one kind of normal fifth and one kind of normal unison and one kind of normal octave.  If you say ""a fourth"", well, that could mean a fourth that was altered, like a diminished fourth or an augmented fourth.  But you want to talk about the fourth that hasn't been changed.  So you call it a ""perfect"" fourth.  By the way, the major and minor intervals are all in the major scale, as are the perfect intervals.  The only diminished interval in the major scale is the diminished fifth, between the 7th and 4th, and the only augmented interval there is the augmented fourth, between the 4th and 7th.  Actually, this is useful to look at.  Let's examine the C major scale.  The seconds in the C major scale are C D (major), D E (major), E F (minor), F G (major), G A (major), A B (major), B C (minor).  The sevenths are just the reverse.  Before our current system of tuning, the major and minor seconds could actually be of various sizes.  The C D interval, for example, would be a frequency ratio of 9/8, and the D E interval would be the slightly smaller 10/9.  Now they're all equal because we use equal temperament.  The thirds in the C major scale are C E (major), D F (minor), E G (minor), F A (major), G B (major), A C (minor), B D (minor).  The sixths are the reverse.  The fourths in the C major scale are C F (perfect), D G (perfect), E A (perfect), F B (augmented), G C (perfect), A D (perfect), B E (perfect).  The fifths are the reverse.  If you listen to an augmented fourth and a perfect fourth, you'll hear how the perfect fourth is a smooth, open sound while the augmented fourth is a harsher dissonance.  That's why the perfect fourth is considered to be the normal one, as opposed to them both being normal.  Same with their inversions.  Some people think that major intervals come from the major scale and minor intervals come from the minor scale, and they get confused because the minor scale doesn't have a minor second from the tonic.  Hopefully you've picked up by now that this is completely wrong.  The intervals all come from the major scale, and they're major or minor because there are two types of each interval in the scale."

musictheory,3by3jq,chon92,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:28:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to break with the comments and say the notion of perfect fourths and fifths originates with the Ancient Greeks who called their system of tonal organization the Greater Perfect Immutable System and Lesser Perfect Immutable System. The Greater Perfect had four stacks of tetrachords (four note descending scales encompassing a fourth) so that top two tetrachords shared a common tone, bottom two shared a tone, and were separated by the tonic, creating a 15 note scale. The Lesser Perfect System was similar but with three tetrachords instead of four.   The tetrachord was a fixed descending interval of a fourth and two inner tone that were changeable. This system of tetrachords was elaborated by Aristoxenus and later Boethius, and continues into the Middle Ages through the Catholic Church. Of the three tetrachords of Boethius - Diatonic, Chromatic, and Enharmonic - the Diatonic persisted in chant music. Due to the primacy of the Greek aesthetic of perfect fourths and their perfect fifth inversions, the naming convention continued and we are left with it as a 2500 year old legacy.   tl;dr: Greeks used Intervals of fourths and fifths to establish tuning and tetrachords. They really liked those intervals and called their system perfect."

The idea that you would find ""actual musicians"" in this sub in spite of any other music-related sub (indeed, a sub focused on rap music) invokes a distinction between music and other (rap) that functions rhetorically not to bring you to any answer by any 'actual' musician but an answer that has already been inscribed into your question.  I don't really believe that you can understand rap through the ideological lens of western classical theory. There is always something missing in these kinds of analyses. Indeed I do not even believe in any kind of universalizing discourse that has tried to absolve western classical music of its ideological foundations (music as 'organized sound' for example).  There would be other critiques available to your original question as well, such as how does a general public hegemonize musical cultures (as the particularities of Jay-Z and Eminem are brought to be a representation of rap music despite the particularities inherent to rap music itself - by phrasing your question in this way you are already tainting the discourse)."

musictheory,3c17mq,BdaMann,2,Sat Jul 4 04:39:24 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of research on rap, as well as related styles/techniques such as Sprechstimme.

The point of these is not to make great music in and of itself, that much is obvious. Rather, the focus shifts onto the interplay between rhythmic or musical elements and linguistic ones in the text.  So I don't know if Eminem or Jay Z can be regarded as great musicians, but they're certainly accomplished in their own artform and craft."
musictheory,3c17mq,nlaeae,2,Sat Jul 4 07:10:59 2015 UTC,"Rap, like any form of popular music (""pop music""), is often of limited interest theoretically to classically trained musicians. Melodically and harmonically not much happens that is beyond what a first year theory student couldn't more than adequately describe.  A key element of rap is the rhythmic complexity which is something that doesn't get enough attention in Western European Music Theory but can still be comfortably handled by most classically trained folk at least in general terms like syncopation and perhaps even polyrhythms. Insofar as any given example of rap has complex rhythm then it might be of more interest.  As a popular form of music whether a classically trained musician likes it comes down to personal preference (which holds for all styles of music). There is nothing inherently superior or inferior to rap when compared to any other style. You can choose to like it or not.  Likewise the lyric writing tends to value rhyme and timing more than you find in other forms of popular music. People well-trained in poetry probably won't find the lack of strict meter all that attractive but the clever use and manipulation of language will probably draw a smile and the occasional nod of approval. Compared to the modernist and postmodernist poetry that I'm far more interested in I'm guessing that rap doesn't really do much in that regard (ie, is there a language poet rapper?).   Personally I care very little for the semantic content of poetry but am far more interested in the manipulation of language. If the language manipulation happens to have good semantic content then that's a bonus. The little rap I have listened to sometimes features some interesting manipulation with clever content. Not necessarily the mix I would prefer but good enough to be appealing.  But lyric analysis isn't really a strong point within Western European Music Theory.  As for the examples you listed being ""great musicians"" that's an interesting question. Within the classical music world we have certain ways of defining what is a great musician (which often does not include someone who just writes music!). This will often be quite different from how people who follow pop music define the term. In some genres being able to write ""good"" music is an integral part, or even the defining element, of being a ""good musician"". There is absolutely nothing wrong with different groups defining the same word differently. So if the general public thinks of these folks as ""great musicians"" but under a more classically influenced definition they wouldn't be, this isn't a problem. Ie, when talking to laypeople I would use the definition of ""great musician"" that they are most comfortable with and when among my colleagues I would use a different one. Therefore I have no problem with referring to your examples (though I know little of them) as ""great musicians"" within the appropriate context whereas I might not use that term in the context of classical music."

musictheory,3bwyoc,setecordas,4,Thu Jul 2 22:07:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know why modes are always explained as starting on different scale degrees. This post is going to be a bit dense, especially because of all of the terminology, but don't worry. This might seem really arbitrary and hard to remember at first, but after you start playing around more it'll become second nature and you'll begin to associate all the names with sounds and you won't have to think twice about playing them.  So anyways: modes made sense to me once I thought of them as different patterns/collections of intervals that are all related.  C Major (Ionian): C D E F G A B C  C Lydian: C D E F# G A B C  F Lydian: F G A B C D E F  Lydian is Ionian, with a sharp 4th. It is created by taking the major scale formula (W W h W W W h) and starting from the 4th degree. When you play Lydian it sounds a lot like major, but a little sharper and brighter because of the raised 4th which is a tritone. Then you have Mixolydian, which is Ionian with a flat 7. Dorian is Mixolydian with a flat 3, making it minor but since it still has a Maj6 it's somewhat bright still. Aeolian (Minor) is Dorian with a flat 6. Phyrgian is Aeolian with a flat 2nd, giving it a very exotic and dark sound popular in metal and jazz. Then you have Locrian, which is Phyrgian with a flat 5. It is very unstable sounding and doesn't resolve well because the root chord is diminished, so it rarely gets used outside of darker experimental music.  The modes are connected, as you've probably heard that C Major (Ionian) and A Minor (Aeolian) have the same notes. The difference depends on what chord progressions your using and what notes you focus on. If you play a C Major scale and immediately play an A Minor, the A Minor won't really seem minor. If you start droning on the A note and hop back and forth to the C and F above it (minor 3rd and minor 6), it'll start to sound dark and minor. This is because the m3 and m6 are very characteristic of the minor scale.  You can do a similar thing with chords. Depending on which chords you jump to and when you play them it can sound major or minor even though you're playing the same chords: it's about what you're emphasizing and alluding to. Since they are using the same notes, you can also hop over from a major feel to a minor feel smoothly. This is where the way you're currently thinking about modes can come into play. D Dorian basically is C Ionian which basically is G Mixolydian and etc.  Edit: On my computer now. Here's some stuff for reference  Ionian (I): R - M2 - M3 - P4 - P5 - M6 - M7 - R ------------ (C D E F G A B C)  Dorian (II): R - M2 - m3 - P4 - P5 - M6 - m7 - R ---------- (D E F G A B C D || C D Eb F G A Bb C)  Phyrgian (III): R - m2 - m3 - P4 - P5 - m6 - m7 - R ------ (E F G A B C D E || C Db Eb F G Ab Bb C)  Lydian (IV): R - M2 - M3 - Au4 - P5 - M6 - M7 - R -------- (F G A B C D E F || C D E F# G A B C)  Mixolydian (V): R - M2 - M3 - P4 - P5 - M6 - m7 - R ----- (G A B C D E F G || C D E F G A Bb C)  Aeolian (VI): R - M2 - m3 - P4 - P5 - m6 - m7 - R ------- (A B C D E F G A || C D Eb F G Ab Bb C)  Locrian (VII): R - m2 - m3 - P4 - d5 - m6 - m7 - R ------ (B C D E F G A B || C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C)  To get all the modes you can either take the major scale pattern (W-W-h-W-W-W-h) and start at another point (e.g. for Aeolian/Minor it would be: W-h-W-W-W-h-W), or you can think of it like this:  Starting with Lydian (remember it's Ionian/Major with a raised/sharp/augmented 4th)  b4 = Ionian  b7 = Mixolydian  b3 = Dorian  b6 = Aeolian  b2 = Phyrgian  d5 = Locrian  For any guitar players that might be reading this, Matt Warnock has made some great resources for learning about modes and jazz in general."
musictheory,3bwyoc,SpaceCadetJones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:54:19 2015 UTC,"Quick question then, so you will pick a mode if you want to focus on certain intervals?   Like, a chord progression in C min is just a chord progression in Eb maj just focusing on the C min as the I chord in that scale?  So you just shift the tonic to another note in the scale then just call the end result the mode of, blank?   Modes never made much sense to me (they seem too simple), the basic theory sort of does the the applications never really clicked. I remember hearing once if you want to play modal music you just don't resolve into the original maj/ionian tonic.   Apologies for the silly questions, thanks"
musictheory,3bwyoc,derpman4k,2,Sat Jul 4 05:26:28 2015 UTC,"No problem. I still wouldn't consider myself competent with music theory so I can't answer your question fully, but I'll do my best.  For me, yes that's how I approach modes when it comes to creating melodies. When I want something upbeat yet mellow, I go for Dorian (maj6, min3). If I want something really dark, I go for Phyrgian (minor 2nds). For reference I am a guitarist, and the way I usually emphasize a modes flavor is by constantly droning on the root while I play chords/notes in the mode. For Cmin vs. Eb maj, yes that's how I understand it.  I definitely know what you mean with knowing the theory and not seeing the application. Watching videos and listening to how modes were supposed to sound kind of made the idea real, and once I started to actually improvise modal melodies things actually came together.  I can't seem to find the original video that really made modes click for me (it was just a guy droning on a D note while he played different chord progressions), but here's a couple of resources.  Modal Chord Progressions  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTYJgmEvcKA  Guide to Modes and Scales for Jazz Guitar (This one helped me to understand the initial idea of modes)  http://mattwarnockguitar.com/the-complete-guide-to-scales-and-modes-for-jazz-guitar  There's probably other ways to think about modes and methods of applying them, this is just how I've approached it and got something useful out of them. When I kept learning minor/aeolian as major/ionian starting from the 6 as a lot of resources teach, it wasn't giving me anything useful. Matt Warnock's article goes into that."

musictheory,3bwyoc,derpman4k,3,Sat Jul 11 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, in as simple terms as I can make it:  Modes are the names for scales in a certain key, that start on a specific step of that key, and/or the note that is the name of that I (1) chord.  So in the key of C, a major scale starting on C is an Ionian scale, and a C major chord is a C Ionian I (1) chord.  Still in key of C, a scale starting on D is a Dorian scale, and a D minor chord in this key would be a D Dorian or ii scale.  This continues on with E is Phrygian, F is Lydian, G is Mixolydian, A is Aeolian, and B is Locrian.  In different keys this also changes accordingly, since it is dependent upon the whole and half steps in the scales.   It is very confusing, I hope this helps a little?"

musictheory,3c02sm,zonination,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"Well, music theory revolves around the idea of the circle of fifths to create a sense of tension and relaxtulion, and of movement and arrival. You can achieve this by moving to the V chord (five chord or dominant chord) and then back to you I chord (one or tonic chord).   The chords that fake you to V will often follow a sequence where each preceding chord is the V chord of the next, except for the I chord.  For example:  I V I I ii V I I vi ii V I I iii vi ii V I  In chord notation, these would be  C Maj, G Maj, C Maj C Maj, D Min, G Maj, C Maj C Maj, A Min, D Min, G Maj, C Maj A Maj, E Min, A Min, D Min, C Maj  Chords which typically come just before a V chord are called predominant chords. These chords include the ii, IV, vii°, and various altered chords, like Neapolitan, Augmented 6 chords and secondary dominants.   I IV V I is a very typical progression:  C Maj, F Maj, G Maj  You can also place the IV just before the ii.  I IV ii V I  C Maj, F Maj, D Min, G Maj, C Maj  Notice that the I chord is the V chord of the IV chord, so it works well to come after a I.   You use a vii° right before a V or in place of a V chord.   This is the basics of it. You can also use chords from different keys or modes, but the more notes the key or mode share in common, the more successful it will be. You can change the quality of any chord to a dom or dom7 chord to give it a stronger since of motion and arrival to the next chord. You can also change the quality of chords to diminished or diminished 7s and do a number of useful things with those."
musictheory,3bvfhg,zazabar,6,Thu Jul 2 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"Well, at first you learn to control rhythmic variety by writing a varied line on top of a whole-note CF. Then eventually you move into free counterpoint, where both (or more) lines are rhythmically varied... no need to write a CF at all. The rules governing two florid lines depend on how they relate to each other at the moment (basically by which one is longer at that point, like you said)."

musictheory,3bvfhg,nlaeae,5,Thu Jul 2 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"More accurately, as Westergaard points out in his Introduction to Tonal Theory,  the whole point of species exercises (arguably) is that the various combinations of lines in n-th species with one another (or with the cantus firmus) actually exhaust all potential rhythmic relationships of notes with one another and with the barline (i.e. the beat). Thus, any combination of note against note in an actual composition can indeed be governed by a rule from species counterpoint."
musictheory,3bty45,Saxington,21,Thu Jul 2 03:12:04 2015 UTC,What you're talking about is called Tritone Substitution. There's a lot you can do with it
musictheory,3bty45,jmarchuk,11,Thu Jul 2 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Conventionally speaking, tritone substitution is where we have a dominant V7 chord and instead of using that chord, we substitute a bII7 chord. Both the V7 and the bII share the same tritone in whatever key you're using. For example, you can have a song in the key of C and a progression of ii7, V7, I or Dm7, G7, then C. Instead of having our root jump around from D to G to C, we can use the Tritone substitute of G7, which is Db7, and have our root move D to Db to C (a chord progression of ii7, bII7, I). This also creates a tendency in the 6th scale degree of the tritone substitute, as we now have a lowered 6th that can potentially move to scale degree 5 of the tonic (Ab to G).   Bear in mind, though, that this creates a parallel 5th in the voicing (Db and Ab moving to C and G). In modern voicing, this is manageable, but you can avoid it by inverting your sonorities or moving the b6 tendency tone away from the fifth of the tonic instead of resolving it down by half-step. You can also resolve a bII7 deceptively to a bVI chord to avoid this parallel motion. This way, the 5th of your tritone substitute - in our example above, Ab - would remain a common tone while your root and third both descend by half step and whole step to C and Eb respectively. This kind of resolution of the tritone sub is my personal preference. You can also think of this as a sort of ""soft modulation"" procedure or a ""pivot"" to another key. In this example, I could simply be modulating to Ab Major by using the Tritone Substitute to 'pivot' from C Major.   Fun times can be had with the tritone sub. ;)"
musictheory,3bty45,Salemosophy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:05:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting side-note -- tritone subs in jazz are essentially what's known in classical music as augmented sixth chords.  Even though they contain the contain the same notes as a dominant chord, they resolve in a different way."
musictheory,3bty45,ckaili,2,Thu Jul 2 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"Not exactly... They resolve in the same way if you're talking specifically about a Ger+6 resolving to a V7, but French, Italian, and Swiss resolve differently. And in any case tritone substitution is Jazz is normally a replacement for the dominant chord where augmented sixth chords have a a subdominant function."
musictheory,3bty45,shipley,2,Thu Jul 2 15:03:56 2015 UTC,"I meant specifically to highlight how the augmented sixth interval resolves outward chromatically, which is how the enharmonic interval in a tritone sub moves as well when it replaces a V7-I of some sort.  Also, you could think of an augmented sixth's function as being a sort of tritone sub of V7/V as far as preparing the dominant.  I'm sure I'm overlooking the specific nuances of the functions of each type of augmented sixth chord, though."

musictheory,3bty45,museman,12,Thu Jul 2 05:04:03 2015 UTC,I find that a really nice thing about tritone substitution is that it turns a ii7-V7-Imaj7 into a nice chromatic sequence.  In C:  |Dm7 |G7  |CΔ  |   becomes  |Dm7 |Db7 |CΔ  |

musictheory,3bty45,LydianAlchemist,2,Thu Jul 2 06:31:02 2015 UTC,is 7b5 jazz notation? Legitimately curious because I know that chord as a viio7 (assuming that's a diminished 7th as well for the two sets of tritones) and know nothing about jazz.
musictheory,3bty45,LarryLarington,3,Thu Jul 2 08:31:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd call ""7b5"" jazz notation (more like ""chord symbol without the root""), though that might be the case, but regardless a 7b5 and a viio7 are not quite the same. With e.g. C as the root, a C7b5 would be C, E, Gb, Bb, whereas Co7 would be C, Eb, Gb, Bbb. So where a 7b5 contains a major third and minor seventh, a viio7 contains a minor third and diminished seventh, though both have that diminished fifth. Functionally, a 7b5 resolves a perfect fifth down, that is it functions as a regular dominant, while a viio7 resolves a minor second up. (I don't know if this is common internationally, but here in Denmark we would call a viio7 an ""incomplete dominant"", because it's basically a V7b9 without the root and functions that way.)  What I think is meant by 7b5 in this case, is this: Each note of a tritone, when it appears in a dominant seventh chord, resolves either up or down. So in the case of F major, the third of a C7b5 chord would resolve upwards to the root of F, while the seventh resolves down to the third (E->F and Bb->A). Resolving to a B major chord instead, treating the C7b5 as a tritone substitution for F#7, the tritone would resolve in the opposite direction instead (E->D# and A#->B).  But you can treat the tritone between the root and diminished fifth like this as well.* Then the C7b5 would either resolve to G major or Db major. If you substitute the C7b5 for a Gb7b5/F#7b5 the same would apply, because they also share that root-b5 tritone.  *At least theoretically, though I have to admit that I don't recall ever having seen this before."
musictheory,3bty45,Epistimi,2,Thu Jul 2 10:00:28 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh now I understand what you're talking about. These four cases can actually also be explained by the way you spell the chord. The 7b5 as you describe it is actually enharmonic to a French augmented 6th chord. I'll go through the four chord resolutions with the example pitches of C, E, Gb and Bb, and how I would spell them:  1. Resolving to F  Essentially we are using a Fr+6 with Bb as the tonic spelled Bb, C, E, Gb. The augmented sixth (Gb and E) resolves outward to the octave F (with correct inversion of chord, not the list of pitches I provided). The other notes could potentially move directly to an F major chord (V in Bb) or do the more common I64-V voice leading.  2. Resolving to B  A Fr+6 in E spelled E, F#, A#, C. The augmented sixth (C and A#) resolves outward to the octave B giving us either a B major chord (V) or an E64 (I64).  3. Resolving to G   A V7b9 with B as the tonic spelled F#, A#, C, E. Operates just as a V7 so root resolves upward to G for a deceptive bVI progression.  4. Resolving to Db  V7b9 in F as the tonic spelled C, E, Gb, Bb. This is a deceptive cadence to Db as the bVI.     This is how I see the chord functioning in various harmonic settings. Keep in mind there are cases for both major and minor, so analyzing the chord with the stated possibilities gives us much more than just four chords to go to. It's actually kind of interesting how we can explain the behavior of this chord from two different perspectives!"
musictheory,3bty45,LarryLarington,3,Thu Jul 2 16:53:02 2015 UTC,Jazz is a relative term.  It's popular notation.  The vii07 is actually a m7b5 built on the 7 of the scale.  7b5 would be a dominant 7th with a b5 -- hence the two tritones.
musictheory,3bty45,xiipaoc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you! I misunderstood that notation for a diminished 7th chord. It can actually also be interpreted as a Fr+6 chord, which I went through in my reply to Epistimi."
musictheory,3bty45,LarryLarington,2,Thu Jul 2 16:54:21 2015 UTC,Is there a method you can use to determine how chords will resolve? How do you know that this particular chord will resolve to 4 different major chords?
musictheory,3bty45,ilikebooks123,2,Thu Jul 2 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"@ /u/ilikebooks123   It also can resolve to 2 different minor 7 chords.  Maybe resolve is the wrong word. But the method is just half step chromatic motion of the notes found in the chord. (kind of like a tritone sub, or how dominant chords resolve major 3rd of a V7 pulls to the root of the I and the 7th of the V7 pulls to the third of the I)  I was just playing with it on my piano experimenting. I could be wrong, and to be fair the 2nd inversion of, for example, B7b5 is an F7b5, so it would resolve to half the chords I mentioned before it's acting as a different chord.    Introduction:  We build chords by stacking thirds right? Think of a Major 7 chord as 2 major third harmonies a minor 3rd apart:  So for a C major 7:   C to E is a major 3rd E to G is a minor 3rd G to B is major 3rd   A C7b5 chord is like 2 major thirds a step apart.   C to E is a major third E to Gb is a step, major 2nd, a step Gb to Bb is a major third   so if we move either of the major 3rd pairs (C E or Gb Bb) “out” (down for the lower C E, up for the upper Gb Bb) we get major 7th chords for B and for C and moving them “in” also creates major 7th chords, just inverted ones, for Gb and F:    Inversions of 7b5:  The 2nd inversion of a 7b5 chord is another 7b5 chord a tritone away   C7b5 (C E Gb Bb) is also Gb7b5 (Gb Bb C E) B7b5 is also F7b5 etc...

Resolving to Minor 7 chords:  C E Gb> <Bb   move the Gb up to G, and the Bb down to A and you get A minor 7 (1st inversion CEGA)  C> <E Gb Bb   move the C up to Db and the E down to Eb, and you get Eb minor 7 (3rd inversion Db Eb Gb Bb)  I only just started playing with these ideas so idk if resolving to m7 chords from a 7b5 is even a thing.."
musictheory,3bty45,LydianAlchemist,5,Thu Jul 2 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"Others are right that this is a tritone substitution, but you can generalize it farther. All dominant 7th chords are ""derived"" from a diminished 7th by lowering 1 note of the dim7 chord. For example, F# dim7 has the notes F#, A, C, Eb. If you lower F# to F, you get F7; but if you lower C to B you get B7. If you lower A to G# you get G#7 and if you lower Eb to D you get D7.   But wait--there's more! If you raise any note of the dim7 chord, you get a half-diminished seventh chord. So there are 8 different seventh chords all connected around the nexus of the single F# dim7 we started with... you can move from any one of those to any other by sliding a couple voices around a little bit. So the tritone substitution is just one example of a much bigger phenomenon. (The same phenomenon also describes chromatic mediant relationships between major/minor triads, where the triads are connected through an augmented triad rather than a diminished seventh.)"
musictheory,3bty45,vornska,2,Thu Jul 2 12:53:51 2015 UTC,Is it right to say that the substitute of the dominant seventh chord is the neapolitan chord with a minor seventh ? The color given by this substitution is great. edit : typo
musictheory,3bty45,BlueInt32,2,Thu Jul 2 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah the difference is the seventh but that seventh makes a big difference because it's also the leading tone of the scale. So the Neapolitan chord, which has no leading tone, functions as a subdominant which usually leads to the dominant. Whereas a tritones substitution, which has the leading tone, usually functions as a dominant chord."
musictheory,3bty45,flyingpenguin6,0,Thu Jul 2 08:14:51 2015 UTC,"No, the Neapolitan chord is something else.  bII6 is a substitute for ii6 and IV, and it's always in first inversion.  The tritone substitution is probably more accurately thought of as a rootless V07b9b5."

Our ""Bb"" is simply ""B"" in Germany.  Yes, Germany uses the same alphabet as in English, in the same order.

musictheory,3brxvr,SimonLB,14,Wed Jul 1 22:40:07 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the Guidonian hexachord system. Modern note names come from Guido and from the Dialogus de musica. Music was primarily based on three diatonic hexachords: one beginning on C, one beginning a fifth above that on G, and one beginning a fifth below on F. All three hexachords used the pattern whole-whole-half-whole-whole.  That yields this pitch collection:  http://i.imgur.com/FL8wf6x.png (source: Cambridge History of Western Music Theory)  You can see that the letter names are mostly Latin letters. Because there are two kinds of b, the b was written two different ways to signify each—a squareish b (that kind of looks like an h!) and a roundish b. These were called the hard b and the soft b, respectively. The names for the Bs is also reflected in the hexachords: the F hexachord, which has the soft b, was called the soft hexachord; the G hexachord, which has the hard b, was called the hard hexachord.  So basically, the B-flat was just as fundamental to this pitch system as B-natural. I've read that this may partially have been a translation error too because the h and the hard b look similar, but it makes sense anyway—since B-natural and B-flat are equally important, they both get their own letter names in the German system. The natural hexachord was CDEFGA, the soft hexachord FGABCD, and the hard hexachord GAHCDE."

musictheory,3bu11e,jmarchuk,6,Thu Jul 2 03:40:57 2015 UTC,"As an amateur composer and percussionist, I would recommend specifying what you want done with the pedal, just because it gives you another degree of control over what your piece sounds like. If you want to leave it to the discretion of the player, that's fine. We can figure it out, but no two players would do it in exactly the same way (unless the phrasing makes it super obvious). As for extended techniques, by far the most common is using a bass bow on the bars to create a shimmering sound."
musictheory,3bu11e,LHippopotamelan,4,Thu Jul 2 04:24:40 2015 UTC,"One thing to definitely keep in mind is sticking -- how the player is going to physically accomplish the written music.  This is especially important to consider for four-mallet passages.  I'm not experienced enough a percussionist to tell you how to do this well, but you want want to keep a percussionist friend on hand to look over your music to make sure it's playable.  It probably is, and you can actually get a very good spread on one hand (though it's more difficult to control that spread than to move your hand over to a new position).  The vibraphone has a motor.  Don't ever use that thing, because actually lots of vibraphones don't have a working motor, or it's annoying to plug in.  Different instruments have different ranged.  Marimbas, for example, can range from 4 1/4 (lowest note is an A) to 5 octaves (lowest note is a C).  If it's really important to have those low notes -- and it may be -- make sure that the instrument has them.  Similarly, there are extended-range glockenspiels.  Those are not standard.  If the one you have available has this extended range, your music may not be playable on other sets.  Be aware of mallet types.  Often those are chosen by the player, but you may want to specify them yourself.  You can get a really brilliant sound out of the glock with hard plastic mallets, but soft plastic mallets are also interesting -- much, much less brilliant, if you need that.  Don't use brass mallets on a xylophone -- that should be plastic or wood only.  The vibraphone can take yarn or plastic.  Plastic on marimba sounds like shit, so that one's mostly yarn, but soft yarn has a very different feel from hard yarn.  You mention that the group is mostly mallets.  Are there other instruments too?  Crotales?  Cymbals, triangles, tam-tams, etc.?  Wood blocks, temple blocks, vibraslaps, agogos, cowbells, jingle bells, claves, etc.?  Snare drums, bass drums, timbales, toms?  Timpani?  Drum set?  Be careful about damaging equipment.  Brass mallets on a marimba will destroy it.  Yarn mallets on a cymbal sound great but will destroy the mallets over time.  If you want to use yarn mallets on a cymbal, make sure there's time to switch mallets to a shittier pair.  Bowing shit is really overdone.  Only use it if you're sure it's for a really good reason and not just for the hell of it, and also that your musicians have bows."
musictheory,3bu11e,xiipaoc,3,Thu Jul 2 13:07:17 2015 UTC,"The motor on the vibes is VERY important, you should use it. That is where the name Vibraphone comes from."

A lot of people like bowing bars, personally I think it is a bit overused but it can still be a nice sound. I also like the way stick-clicks sound on Marimba (striking the ends of the bars with the part of the stick that you hold) but you can't switch quickly between black keys and white keys."
musictheory,3bu11e,tnova,2,Thu Jul 2 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"Just another addition to extended technique. As has already been mentioned, bowing different percussion instruments (vibraphone, suspended cymbal, tam-tam, etc) is a very neat technique. One that I've only seen used once, but is really cool is bowing a metal stand (Manhasset preferably). Sounds like something out of a movie."
musictheory,3bu11e,fredgrigg,2,Thu Jul 2 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"Note that if you decide to write glisses in your piece, they will be very quiet if done on a vibraphone or marimba and will be decently loud on xylophone and glockenspiel. If you decide to write a gliss on accidental keys then there will be many small pauses in the sound when performing the gliss because of the empty space between the accidentals. Make sure the music is physically possible to be played; if you're writing four mallet music, try to keep the range between two mallets on one hand an octave or smaller if you're planning on writing a decently fast part across multiple notes to be played on that only that hand as control of the mallets begins to weaken at any wider of an interval. Do note however that you can write for a distance longer than an octave to be played by a single hand if its the same notes, a slow passage, or a roll. Lastly, if you're writing for a 5 octave marimba, don't have notes on both extremes of the keyboard being played at the same time as it's difficult to stretch your arms far enough to play both ends comfortably."
musictheory,3bu11e,UltimaFanX,2,Fri Jul 3 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"A few things that immediately come to mind without getting too in depth. Sticking: imagine yourself playing the music and make sure that there is a sticking that is reasonable to be playable for the percussionists. Range: remember the ranges of the instruments you're working with. Pretty simple. But also remember that extreme jumps (multiple octaves, that kind of thing) can be pretty tricky to play. If you're composing for four mallet pieces: make sure that the chords and changes are possible. This one is harder to imagine if you are not a percussionist, so if you are really not sure about a certain weird chord change, ask a percussionist. Finally, instrumentation and texture: this is why I LOVE percussion ensemble pieces. They can be simple as hell, but using the right sounds, timbres and textures can make something absolutely beautiful, extremely aggressive or anything in between. Listen to lots of percussion pieces for ideas in this! Cymbals are ridiculously dynamic instruments and can really enhance whatever soundscape you're working with. ALSO, try to avoid 16th note runs on glocks/bells. They're painful to the ear. Best of luck to you!"

I would definitely include mallet choice and pedaling, if you desire it on the vibraphone. Like one postee said, make sure you have the correct ranges for the marimba. Also keep in mind that the vibes and marimba parts can be more chordal whereas the glock and xylo parts should be more melodic because you typically use two mallets and they're also usually louder. Minor and major seconds are also kind of hard to play, but doable. I would check out kieko abe for a start. Gl"

If the former is true, try writing a good theme first and finding harmonies to match, not vice versa.   ""Darkness"" is a complicated concept to get at. Lots of diminished chords is a good place to start, and there are lots of chromatic tricks you can use to create uneasiness. Avoiding strong cadences is also a good rule of thumb.   EDIT: Here's how I approach these things. I keep a notebook by my side at all times. Whenever a scrap of melody or harmony or rhythm pops into my head I write it down. After a couple of days I come back to it and see if it holds water. If it does, I see if it goes well with any of my other sketches. Only then do I start actually writing.   P.P.S.

musictheory,3btjej,Arsenious,2,Thu Jul 2 07:25:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, what I mean by ""Chorale-style"" was something that sounds, texturally, like this or this (both chorale or motet-style but with radically different musical languages). Everybody's singing the same words at the same time, &c.   FWIW I really do think you should find a good theme first. It doesn't have to be more than a few bars. You can build a compelling progression off of that, but in my experience trying too hard to be clever with your harmony will usually backfire and end up creating music that's confusing and awful. I'm not Wagner or Stravinsky or Messiaen and there's a pretty good chance you aren't either.  General tips for writing something disorienting and dark:  * Use lots fully-diminished 7th or even 9th chords  * Tone clusters are fun, but they have to be functional  * Modulations! Keeping your tonality unstable feels developmental & such.  * Modes are cool too, especially the Dorian and Phrygian if you're considering writing something in the minor  And more generally: listen to as much music as you can, pick out stuff you like, and try to understand what makes them sound the way they sound. I'm classically educated, so I'm naturally more likely to suggest stuff up that alley. Maybe something like the Verdi Requiem, start at 2:00 for general dark melancholy, 12:00 for raging at the heavens has a similar sound to what you're looking for? Or not. What do I know?

musictheory,3bt8f9,anatoly,9,Wed Jul 1 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"What about key signatures? How are those written in your system?   You also lose the convenience of having a sharp/flat (basically) mean a black key while a natural means a white key, which is convenient for keyboardists, mallet percussion, and harp... and kind of woodwind instruments as well since the simplest fingerings are generally ""white notes"". In other words, you lose a lot of the whole connection between the music notation and the physical configurations used to play the notes.  Usually proposed changes to our system seem to overcomplicate rather than solve problems. Our music notation system is the product of about 1000 years of adaptations and tweaking; it actually works pretty darn well."
musictheory,3bt8f9,m3g0wnz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:00:27 2015 UTC,"You could use the same signs (either +,- or just reuse sharp,flat) for the key signature: they establish permanent changes from the scale we happen to use as the default for historical reasons.   I take your point about losing the ""sharp/flat = black key"" hint, which I didn't think of. And I'm sure you're right that the current system is likely to be better than any tweaking I might suggest. I'm not actually trying to reform notation; just curious about why things work as they do."
musictheory,3bt8f9,the-postminimalist,5,Thu Jul 2 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to give a proper comprehensive answer, but I'll answer anyway until a better one comes up.  I'm not sure why you see the flat and sharp system as a problem, as if you're transposing it should only be difficult composers using outdated computer composition softwares. On paper, you just write the sharps and flats as you want them. On newer softwares, transposing should automatically fix the proper accidentals. And honestly, the +/- system would be worse for atonality. If you want a reform for well-tempered atonal music, it would be best to just go with 12 individually named notes and more staff lines or something like that. But sharps and flats work great. They don't actually mean ""raise and lower"" by default. It's just sometimes, in context, you could explain them that way. But they're all individual notes, not plusses and minuses.  A lot of theorists' analyses that I've seen refuse to consider the vast majority of out-of-key accidentals as raised and lowered notes, but instead as a very brief modulation to another key that includes that note, and I agree with that view. Because to me, the whole ""raised and lowered"" idea seems really elementary and, in reality, incorrect.  Though I'm just an undergrad in composition, so I may not be correct in some corners of this topic."
musictheory,3bt8f9,LarryLarington,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:05:53 2015 UTC,Your last point about out-of-key accidentals interpreted as brief modulations is a pretty interesting one... and a little confusing. How would you analyze a b7 scale degree in a I-V-V7/IV-IV-V-I? Or say a #4 scale degree in a I-IV-V/V-V-I? We're not modulating in these cases and rather using secondary functions. I'm guessing you'd treat IV and V (respectively) as temporary tonicizations?
musictheory,3bt8f9,the-postminimalist,2,Thu Jul 2 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"I, not being a theorist, would write them as secondary dominants. But I have seen it being interpreted as a brief modulation for the two chords, so V/V-V would instead be V-I of the other key. So yes to the temporary tonicizations."
musictheory,3bt8f9,the-postminimalist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"Your answer gives a lot to think about, so thank you. I see the ""problem"" in transposing accidentals not so much as a difficulty but as a symptom of the notation not being ""tonal enough"". The reason we have key signatures in the first place is to better express tonality, right? - and I was wondering why accidentals don't work in a ""tonal-compatible"" way as well. As for atonal music, I guess you could simply write it (and I guess that's how it's usually written?) without a key signature, and then there's no difference between using sharp/flats normally or the way I suggest.  Your other point, about accidentals often being not exactly an intentional raising/lowering of a particualr degree but rather a brief modulation is a very interesting one, and I agree that adopting this view does away with most of what I saw as the motivation for the change I suggested."
musictheory,3bt8f9,nlaeae,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"and then there's no difference between using sharp/flats normally or the way I suggest.   Oooooh yes there is. There is an actual difference between C, B#, and D double flat. I'm sure someone else can better explain it, but basically on non-well-tempered instruments, like the violin, the musician unconsciously plays the note differently whether it's a C or a B#. They're actually different notes. This is why they also work in a tonal compatible way. All these different accidental mean something in relation to the tonic note.  Not sure if I answered your questions properly. I'm sometimes not that good with explanations."
musictheory,3bt8f9,saxguy2001,5,Thu Jul 2 16:21:02 2015 UTC,"You can notate a piece like this if you want, it's quite easy. Just transpose it to C major (or A minor, whatever) and write ""In key"" before the music (like you do for transposing instruments). Then use the appropriate exotic clef to put the tonic note where you actually want it on the staff. (For instance, if the piece was actually in Bb major, you'd write ""In Bb"" and use the 8va alto clef.) Then ""sharp"", ""flat"" and ""natural"" will have the meaning you want here.  One problem arises when you want to add a section in a different key - rather than just changing the key signature, you'll need a ""Muta in key"" indication, combined with the appropriate clef for the new key."
musictheory,3bt8f9,TheChurchofHelix,2,Thu Jul 2 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with m3g0wnz.  In addition to that, what you proposed makes sense to you, but think about how much experience you have.  What about beginning and young students?  My elementary band students struggle enough with the difference between A-natural and Ab or E-natural and Eb (B and Bb, F# and F for trumpets and clarinets), particularly when they're expected to check the key signature ahead of time to know if a note is sharp or flat or still natural, but at least they know exactly what Ab or F# is compared to A and F if they have that symbol to look at.  Now imagine they've learned A already, they just learned Ab, and now they're encountering accidentals with notes outside the key signature.  So there's an Ab in the key signature, they see a + for A-natural, then back to a 0 for Ab.  Next song there's no Ab in the key signature, they see a - for Ab, and then they see a 0 for A-natural, except they just saw 0 meaning Ab in the previous song!  So instead of # and b being definitive symbols that mean exactly one thing and are easier to learn when you're young and learning to read music and improve as a musician, now it's + 0 and - that could mean different things depending on what key you're in?  Sure it can be useful from a theoretical standpoint... until you have a temporary modulation where you don't want to change the key signature for just a couple measures and your system is no longer useful in the way you intended.  If I'm in C major and see A C# and E followed by D F and A, that C# doesn't function as being a half-step above C - it functions as the 3rd of that A major chord that functions as a secondary dominant."
musictheory,3bt8f9,elyisgreat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, and I understand where you're coming from. However, in our current diatonic piano-centric music notation, there is a very clear need for sharps and flats, as they indicate to the player if they're using a black key or a white key (in simple key signatures).  Rather than making a complicated multi-symbolic system, why not simply redesign the musical stave so that it better accommodates chromaticism, and therefore eliminates the need for accidentals completely? Right now, between middle C and the next C, there are 7 notes, taking up four lines and three spaces. Why not write a denser stave, so that those 7 notes span 6 lines and 5 spaces? Of course, not all the lines would be used - the lines and spaces for notes outside of the C major scale (like, say, Eb or C#) would be skipped. A key signature would no longer indicate which notes are no longer black keys, but could indicate which notes were in the scale.  Now, since accidentals have been eliminated in this new system, we'd need new note names. For sake of simplicity, I'm just gonna used fixed-Do solfeg. You know, Do, Ra(Di), Re, Me(Ri), Mi, Fa, Fi, So, Le(Si), La, Te(Li), Ti. The way I envision it, the spaces hold the whole-tone scale Do, Re, Mi, Ri, Si, Te Do; while the lines hold the scale Ra, Me, Fa, So, La, Ti, Ra. Chords look pretty nice, and you can pretty easily see their relationships in terms of leading tones and whatnot.   I'm sure I'm not the first person to come up with this idea. It seems straightforward, so I'm sure its been thought of and fleshed out before."

Shouldn't they have the same fingerings as a french horn? In the majority of all bands, french horn players typically play the mellophone for marching band, so why would they change the fingerings?"
musictheory,3bu6bw,makemegobacktowork,2,Thu Jul 2 08:54:34 2015 UTC,"If you want to get technical, part of it is because of the way the instruments are constructed:  the 1st valve lowers a note down a whole step.  The 2nd valve lowers a note a half step.  The 3rd valve lowers a note a step and a half.  This applies to all 3 valve instruments (a fourth valve typically lowers you a fourth).  Even horn.  The difference with horn is that the note people typically start on (written C, concert F) is not low on it's overtone series.  It's actually like 3 or 4 up.  This is why the next jump in open fingerings is a 3rd (written C to E, concert F to A).  Meanwhile, other brass instruments will typically learn concert Bb first, where the next partial is F, a fifth up.  MEANWHILE, the mellophone actually starts in the ""typical"" part of the overtone series compared to other brass instruments.  This is the mechanical reason for the fingerings question.  The next is just understanding the overtone series, which is the progression of intervals as you get higher through a lip slur.  Octave, fifth, fourth, major third, minor third, minor third, second, second, second, second, second, second, then half steps forever.  All brass instruments follow this path with the each valve.  It just depends  on where you start.  Now, the mellophone is odd.  But it's not different than horn, it's just transposed.  But if you desire, there is a bastard instrument known as a marching french horn.  The mellophone simply replaces the role of the horn."
musictheory,3bu6bw,EpicureanHorn,2,Thu Jul 2 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"Because Mellophone music is written in F and trumpet music is written in Bb. The fingerings for the actual concert pitches are completely different. This is actually the exact reason we have things like horn in F, saxophone in Eb, etc., so that someone can learn the fingerings for one instrument and then play another instrument with the same fingerings. Even though the fingerings for the actual notes are different, the fingerings for the written notes are the same."
musictheory,3bu6bw,asuavegentleman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"As u/silversonic referenced, this is because the spacing between notes is actually uniform between all brass instruments. That is to say, tubas, baritones, valve trombones, mellophones, and trumpets all use the same order of fingerings to produce different actual notes. Why this happens physics wise is a good bit more complicated. To put it in a nutshell, different sized pipes make different pitches/octaves but the sequences between open notes tend to be the same."

musictheory,3bsbmo,rcochrane,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"One of many ways to approach the melodic minor modes is to notice that each one is a pair of half-diminished arpeggios (1 b3 b5 b7) on different roots a whole tone apart.   For example:  C D Eb F G A B      C Melodic Minor   D    F   A B      Bm7b5 C   Eb   G A        Am7b5   You're playing what /u/MiguelMarquezMusic and I both call ""Aeolian b5"", in which the lower of the two half-diminished arps is based on the root.  So to get the sound on Am7b5, just play the chord tones (A C Eb Bb) and superimpose the half-diminished chord a tone higher, Bm7b5 (B F D A). In general, the rule is ""On a m7b5, move the arpeggio up a tone"". This is super easy to do on guitar if you know your moveable arpeggio shapes.

musictheory,3bp6id,zuurrkk,12,Wed Jul 1 01:02:36 2015 UTC,"The sound is usually created by a chromatic harmonization of the pentatonic scale. So the melody will be mostly pentatonic, with a crunchy progression behind it, full of lots of borrowed minor chords (iv, iiº in a major key), secondary dominants, and those types of devices. One that comes to mind pretty quickly is this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc1FvrL4EqA The prechorus is a big point of chromatic harmony. You get the secondary dominant at around 1:05, followed by the borrowed chord at 1:10.   Something to keep in mind about Marty Friedman's progression is that when he gets to x05500 at around 1:35, that chord is actually kind of just the progression beginning over again in a reharmonization, as signaled by the preceding cadence/turnaround. Reharmonizing the second playthrough of the verse to be slightly more minor is a pretty common facet of J-Pop, and worth learning, but while you're still coming to grips with the style, it will help to realize it for what it is. They key factor of this music, though, is that it uses chromatic, jazzy chords to outline a pentatonic melody. Even Friedman's progression outlines a ""ghost"" pentatonic melody."

musictheory,3bp6id,JollyBard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but the melody wasn't ""far from"" pentatonic. It was major, with pentatonic leanings. The beginning was A, E, A, B, D, which all fit into the pentatonic framework (most easily named D major pentatonic, but not really in D). The next note is C#, which is not a note in that same pentatonic framework, but is in A major pentatonic, and the song itself is in A major, and this is followed by a stepwise descent down to A. The next part of the phrase is D, C#, D, E, C#, B. That ""D, C#, D"" is very non-pentatonic, but the E, C#, B is super-pentatonic, especially since we've already established A major. And the entire song kind of continues like that. So it's not literally or strictly pentatonic, but it does have countless pentatonic signatures throughout."

musictheory,3bp6id,Eutow,0,Wed Jul 1 03:59:20 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, I dispute labeling this ""Japanese"" at all. I guess what he means is that this is a progression typical of Japanese rock writing right now. But it's also just a totally typical 20th century western pop progression with nothing unusual about it, and nothing that sounds unique to me who knows nothing about Japanese music.   From a combination of listening and watching his fingers, this one is (in C major):  I V/vi (with a cad64 susp) vi vi42 (seventh in bass) IV ii7 Vsus IM7 Vsus/vi viio /vi vi9 ii/IV V/IV IV IVm7 iv iii7 vi9 ii7 Vsus IM7,  where this notation isn't all perfect, but I trust anyone who knows roman numerals to follow (in particular, I would consider rewriting the ""ii/IV V/IV IV"" part as actually being in the key of F, as ii/IV isn't really standard notation).  So, really this is enough chords for a whole song. I would say it contains more than one progression. But, without discussing the phrase structure, everything in here is totally standard from the point of view of classical western harmony -- there's a couple of tonicizations of diatonic chords (vi a couple of times, and IV as mentioned above), use of 7 and 9 chords, sequences of fifths, and borrowing from the parallel minor -- all very standard moves, that you will find discussed in any harmony reference. If this were a harmony class exercise my main criticism would be the b to b flat cross relation when he moves from a minor 9 to g minor, but it sounds fine in a poppy context.  I guess this isn't really answering your question. Where to hear progressions like this? Well, anywhere, I guess. This exact progression, dressed up with different texture and instruments, could very easily sound like anything from the Beatles to Django Reinhart to Billie Holiday to Wilco. There's nothing really unique or colorful about this progression to my ears (though it is perfectly nice sounding), and a lot of 20th century pop/jazz/rock will have similar progressions."

Having to go down to a C when when the notes continue upwards is awquard and you can fit more keys in. (maybe even adapt the layout to the song..? Use one width for everything though, otherwise you'll never train your muscle-memory) - i found the tempo(s) VS. visuals to be a bit jerky - maybe have the option to turn on a metronome and possibly also set your own tempo for custom difficulty (I'm assuming you are using MIDI in a way anyway...?) - more songs... And possibly a ""career""-mode where you have to get it right to get to the next and harder song.

musictheory,3bph92,RobberBaron412,5,Wed Jul 1 02:39:31 2015 UTC,"The chords are:  Dm, Em F, D7/F#, G, E/G#, Am  Take out the D7 and the E for a sec. You can see that its just planing on diatonic chords. Dm is voiced A, D, F. Then each voice just moves up a diatonic step on the keyboard. B, E,G / C, F, A. Then in the second group, G is B, D, G, moving to C, E, A.  Now, for what we left out, D7 (F# in bass, C F# C in rt hand)is a dominant chord that resolves to G. So when we stick it in before the G, at the ""crest"" of the ascent, it puts a tension on that point that is released when we fall back down to G.   E is the other chord we left out. That is the chord that resolves to A. So it goes just before the last note, the A. Look at how the melody moves up in semitones: G, Ab, A, that it is a smooth walk up to the penultimate chord.  Oh yeah, and the baseline is just a stepwise walk up from D to A with the chromatic tones F# and G#"

Edit: I want to tag on one more thing for anyone reading. I think I wasn't too far off with the descending part. If you play a secondary part in the left hand, it sounds a great deal more full; like the track.  So, in our walk up from D to A, on the last four notes also play: D, E, D, C. It's a simple add-on, but adds a lot of body."

musictheory,3bph92,bentthroat,2,Wed Jul 1 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"It's basically the combination of a chromatic bass and cadence. There's not really much contrary motion going on, even though there sounds like there is. Rather, the bass line does nothing but ascend, and there is a prominent middle line that ascends for three notes, and then jumps back down to its starting note and repeats, adding a chromatic passing tone between its second and third notes. I'm pretty sure there is a V6/4 cadence going on in the inner voices here, so I6/4>V>I, and then there is an ascending bassline beneath it which does not follow this cadence but still lands in the right place. This obscures the cadence while still making it present, and that's the important factor in it sounding ""gospel-y""."
musictheory,3bok0o,nmitchell076,3,Tue Jun 30 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"Schenker's Free Composition includes discussion of at least two pieces which are clearly not ""complete"" in this sense, namely Bach's Prelude BWV 999 and Chopin's Mazurka Op.30 no.2.  Similar analyses (some theorists use the term 'elided Ursatz') are relevant to any work featuring 'progressive' or 'directional tonality', which of course is quite ubiquitous e.g. in contemporary incidental music.  (For instance, Frank Lehman's article on Hollywood Cadences, from MTO (2013), includes extended discussion of such ""swerves"" and ""unrealized harmonic implications"").  As for your more general question about ""a contrapuntal complex that is not completed"", Schenker did allow for ""implied"" or ""substituted"" tones in his Free Composition, and ISTM that these are basically equivalent notions."

You know, I hadn't really ever thought about connecting this to directional tonality. But a few articles on that might be useful to the study. I don't think it actually is directional tonality, though. Because I think from the beginning to the end of the arias in question, we are composing out the space of the initial tonic. We just never finish composing it out. This seems to me to be a different situation from directional tonality. But it will be nice to engage this literature to see how they derive directional tonality, which might be suggestive for how to derive whatever is needed to explain what's happening here."
musictheory,3bok0o,musicpilot,2,Wed Jul 1 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"You may look into works on Romantic fragments; Satyendra 1997 (in Spectrum) comes to mind here. Some Wagner work might also be helpful, with the notion of a linking cadence being generated by a higher level 1/I.  But those are just guesses, it's tough to know exactly what you're looking for with those examples. (I find the word ""collapse"" to be a little ambiguous, for what it's worth.)"
musictheory,3bok0o,Talking_Meat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:22:17 2015 UTC,"Romantic fragments are definitely relevant to this research, if only to compare and contrast the aesthetics at work. So that spectrum article is very useful, thanks!   Let me explain a bit in hopes of clarifying. Look at the Metastasio libretto for the Haydn scene (Haydn sets scene 7 of act 3 in its entirety). As we can see, after an opening recitative, Metastasio scripts a musical number to begin (""Non partir bell’idol mio!""). After the first stanza, Metastasio indicates a repeat of the final line followed by elipses. Berenice interrupts her own aria, she cannot sustain this musical space, but ""collapses"" back into recitative. She then begins a new aria shortly afterwards, one with a much different affect.   The effect to me seems clearly one of ""No! This [action/state of mind/music] will not do! We must find something else!""   And Haydn realizes this in a way that increases this sense. Unlike, say, Gluck, whose setting of the ""incomplete"" text never strays from the tonic as a key area, Haydn gives us a full aria exposition, complete with a modulation to V. Everything about the space Haydn sets up is signalling to us ""okay, this is a normal aria: we just had an exposition, now we are about to have a development and recap, all is right with the world."" The ""break down"" of the aria and the return to recitative (a dramatic shift in the very musical language we are hearing) occurs at the Exposition/Development juncture. Such that the process of returning to and successfully closing in the tonic that is so integral to not just the sonata aesthetic, but also to the aesthetic of 18th century tonal music more generally, fails to materialize.   A situation like this (and there are only about 10 such situations in the hundreds of arias that Metastasio composed texts for,each of them marked in their own unique way) seems to go beyond ""not conforming"" to the sonata principle, or to the coherence of the composed out triad, but seems to deliberately reject those ideas. In fact, that seems rather the point of Haydn's treatment. We move to the dominant, which acts as a large scale tonal dissonance to the tonic, and is providing support for scale degree 2 as a passing tone in the Urlinie (one that would be interrupted in a normal sonata at the start of the Recap). But the resolution of that passing tone never comes to be, the promised resolution of the tonal dissonance evaporates just as Berenice's hope for a reunion with her lover in the afterlife evaporates in a confused state of delirium.   Why collapse? Well, first of all, I want a term that is more expressively marked than interruption, which of course is a standard Schenkerian term. I think it is related to the concept of interruption, but might go beyond that. The second reason has to do with the relation of arias to recit. Recit and arias operate according to different languages and syntax, for one. But arias also represent a different kind of dramatic impulse, they are an opportunity for the onstage character to express their inner being to the audience. The failure of an aria to complete itself corresponds dramatically, I think, with a character failing to express themselves. When an aria collapses, the character's psyche collapses. And this is the sense I get here. There's such an utter sense of defeat at the start or Berenice's second recitative (""Me infelice! Che fingo! Che ragiono!"") followed by one of confusion and fear (""Dove rapita io sono?""). One has the sense that she has watched her world collapse around her, and now collapses herself.  So that is where the term collapse comes from. I want something related to, but more expressively marked to the term interruption. I want to capture the sense that the musical language of aria folds back into the language of recitative (like the aria can't maintain the security of its own borders), and I think it's appropriate for the affect of the scene.   But thank you for the critique of the term. The study is still in its infancy, so my perspective is sure to evolve as I go, not to mention the terms I use."
musictheory,3bok0o,Talking_Meat,2,Wed Jul 1 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"I looked into incomplete structures a while back, although I don't believe I found anyone that talks about it. It seems very similar to the auxiliary cadence, to me; rather than the omission of the opening tonic, it's the omission of the closing tonic.  And can't currently look at the music, but it sounds like the piece goes I-V, is that correct? Is it possible that perhaps the I is actually a IV/V? I suppose I would have to see all of the context to be sure.  It sounds very similar to Schumann's Auf einer Burg in the Liederkreis cycle. That piece clearly ends on a V of A minor, and A minor achieves full closure in the very next song In der Fremde. A colleague of mine worked on those two songs, had a paper about how they share a single Ursatz."

musictheory,3bmwnb,enjoyJDmusic,5,Tue Jun 30 14:40:06 2015 UTC,"Background: I've been teaching theory to music majors in university for over 5 years now, and I also have some experience tutoring privately. I was also employed for a short time by a pre-college private music school to teach music theory.  Some quick thoughts for you—   The age of your potential students matters, a lot. Really young kids just don't really have the attention span for more abstract concepts. I don't think it's worthwhile to make them learn music theory outside of their regular music lessons. But even in general (i.e., for students of all ages), it's weird for people to be learning music theory outside of their regular music lessons. In my mind, ideally music theory needs to be extremely connected to the physical act of making music. So yes I think you really need to have a keyboard or piano for students (unless, of course, you're a guitarist teaching guitar students, and then you should have a guitar). I think the ideal private lesson context for learning music theory would be like an extra-long lesson time where half of that was playing and half of it was theory lessons.    Do you charge the same as instrument/sport/etc lessons?   Yeah I would basically charge the same as for private lessons. Depends on the market where you are, and also how much you value your own time.   Since this is theory and not an instrument, is it wise to have a set course length? i.e. Beginning theory as an 8 week course.   I'm not sure you need to strictly enforce the concept of like an 8-week course or something, but definitely have a curriculum set up and an expected time to complete. But one of the nice things about teaching one-on-one is that you can be flexible with the student. There's no need to rush them or drag them down just to fit an 8-week standard.   Are there any resources for worksheets/exercises/etc that would be beneficial to use?   I highly suggest getting a textbook or using musictheory.net or teoria.com. There's guides on the sidebar.   How different from a classroom setting are theory lessons?   Eh. Content is going to be pretty much the same. Mostly it's better, because the student is getting individual attention. I would include way more student participation in a one-on-one setting. And like I said before, ideally I would incorporate a lot of playing music at an instrument, and this is much more viable with one-on-one instruction than in the classroom."

Being able to hear why certain voice leading changes were more appropriate made a lot more sense than trying to learn it solely on paper. Same thing with modulations and secondary dominant chords. If you don't have a way of playing examples of the concepts find audio samples and get a small speaker or something to the same effect.
musictheory,3bprfo,Solid_Snake7,2,Wed Jul 1 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"What you're hearing are notes within a scale being ""phrased"". Maybe some pedal tones (most commonly the tonic of said chord which is being complimented by other scale degrees).

musictheory,3bprfo,Eutow,2,Wed Jul 1 04:50:51 2015 UTC,"Lets start with the rhythmic profile. If we have a dot represent a rest, and an x represent a note, then it looks like:  . . x . x . x . x . . x . . x . . .  I bolded each on-beat to make it a little bit clearer.  Some interesting characteristics of this riff are that it doesn't start right at the beginning of the measure, and its second half alternates between on- and off-beats.  Going into the notes, this riff is interesting because it has the tension built by its F# (an odd note that makes the modality lean towards C lydian in what would otherwise be a C major situation), which then gives way to an F natural on its fourth and resolving repetition. Basically, it maintains the fundamentals of tension and release.   Riffs straddle the line between harmony and melody. Basically, they are a more interesting way to state your harmony than by just playing chords. Still, they should refer to and clearly show the harmony, and a good harmony has tension and release, so the riff should reflect that."

musictheory,3bm788,rcochrane,2,Tue Jun 30 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Let's say we've got a scale we're planning to harmonize using triads. In a diatonic scale we're going to get some rotation of Maj min min Maj Maj min dim (MmmMMmd). One of those has an imperfect fifth, which we should note. We don't spend much mental energy on this because all the diatonic scales have this same property, so it's not very interesting.  Let's take another scale. I'm going to use a microtonal scale, purely because I'm familiar with it. Porcupine is a scale in 22 tone equal temperament that has step sizes 4333333 to make a 7-note scale with 1 wide whole tone followed by 6 narrow ones. This scale, in this mode, has the triad qualities Maj dim dim dim min min Maj (MdddmmM). That's a fairly long run of diminished chords! Obviously this scale has a clumpy distribution of chord types.  (Side note: the fifth in these diminished chords is only about a quarter-tone flat of pure, and it consists of two minor thirds which are slightly purer than in 12 tone equal temperament, although on the sharp side of pure rather than the flat side. It also consists of 4 identically sized 3-step whole tones. So the effect of the chord is somewhat different than the 12-tone diminished chord.)  On the other hand, if we take that same scale and sharp the seventh to get the step sizes 4333342, the pattern becomes Maj dim min dim Maj min dim (MdmdMmd). Now no two adjacent triads have the same chord quality. What specifically you make of that is up to you, but I personally think this improves the situation with parallel motion compared to the scale where all chords with the same quality appear adjacent to one another. Or maybe the clumpy situation is good too, but in a different way."

What are you planning to use this for, out of interest?   Building a database that I'll find easy to navigate and parse information from. The guitar tab is actually the most important part of it for me, having the rest is just a bonus.   Also do you know what the practical relevance of binary inversion is? Your video series is where I learned of it and I was actually gonna PM you about it. What sort of similarities can we actually hear between two scales with that relationship?"
musictheory,3bm788,rcochrane,2,Wed Jul 1 02:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think that's justification enough to have a single extra digit of information.   Oh absolutely, given how few scales there actually are (compared with the capacity of any database) the overhead is pretty much nil. All information's worth having.   do you know what the practical relevance of binary inversion is?   A scale plus its inverse (which I call its ""coscale"") is a partition of the whole set of 12 tones. So if you're interested in, e.g., improvising chromatically then one simple way to think about that in a structured way is to alternate between the two.  For example, you can choose one scale to represent the ""inside"" notes: for example, a C major scale on a Cmaj7 chord. Then the coscale (Eb Minor Pentatonic in this case) gives you the ""outside"" notes. I got this idea from this great video by Michael Wolff (all his videos are worth watching, he's great!). Here's me noodling around with the idea on guitar in case that helps, although admittedly Wolff sells it better.  If you decide to put the database up online let me know, it sounds like a useful project. All my stuff is in horrible command-line spaghetti code; even if you don't open up the code, being able to call up lists of scales based on criteria could be a great thing."

musictheory,3bm788,PaulsRedditUsername,2,Wed Jul 1 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"The others I can think of are:   Removing or adding notes Combining two scales into one (e.g. the 8-note ""bebop scales"" are sometimes described as being unions of two 7-note scales) Start with an interval and just go up by that interval repeatedly until you hit your starting note, Slonimsky-style (this doesn't generate many possibilities, though). The ""other"" kind of inversion, which you can do by reversing the order of the binary representation (e.g. Harmonic Minor = 101101011001 reverses to 100110101101, which is a mode of Harmonic Major) -- this is what's usually meant by the term ""inversion"" ofc.

musictheory,3bm788,Friek555,3,Tue Jun 30 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is exactly what he means, but in the 18th century, the minor mode was a bit more unstable than the major mode. Some ways in which this crops up:  1) A piece that is in the minor mode nearly always achieved a cadence in the relative major, especially after the rise of the Galant Style. The ""la folia"" pattern also demonstrates this at a micro level, lurching almost immediately to III.  The reverse is not true, there was no generic requirement for major mode pieces to ever modulate to the relative minor. It could and often did happen, but it didn't need to.   2) There is the well-known ""picardy third"" effect, in which a minor mode cadence has its final tonic converted into a major chord. In minor mode Baroque works that modulate to the dominant (and have more than 2 voices), a picardy third is basically always used to convert the harmony into a major V (see Bach's minor-mode keyboard suites, for instance).  Combined with point 1 above, this means that it is a strong generic norm for pieces in the 18th century to ""escape"" the minor mode at some point in the course of the work. Again, the opposite is never true: works basically never achieve a major mode cadence and convert the last harmony into a minor chord.   3) Approaches to cadences are often undermined by modal mixture. The mixture represents something that must fundamentally be overcome before the cadence can be secured. Here is one paradigmatic example: after screeching to a halt on a fermata at 1:42, the music gets ""stuck"" on a repeating 4-5 pattern (1:51), unable to shake it off and proceed onward to the cadence. The minor mode then intrudes in at 1:59, dramaticizing the sense of being ""stuck"" by threatening the modal status of our dominant key area. A highly charged gesture at 2:04 (what I call ""The Amoroso"") successfully breaks out of the cyclical trap and shakes off the minor mode, and we emerge into a modally correct cadential progression at 2:09. Modal inflections are thus a very real ""dissonance"" in the 18th century. The opposite situation - in which an expected minor mode cadence is thwarted by borrowing from the major mode -  never happens.   4) After the advent of the Galant Style and on into the Classical Style, minor mode works are simply less common. The overwhelming majority of pieces are in the major mode. The result being that any piece that is in the minor mode is marked as special, perhaps one could even say exceptional.   5) It is common (though not a generic requirement) for Classical Works in the minor mode to enact a ""dark to light"" narrative, in which the final movement emerges into the parallel major (sort of a large scale picardy third).  Mozart's Concerto in D minor, Beethoven's 2 minor-mode Symphonies, Haydn's Farewell Symphony, etc. There is no corresponding strategy that converts the major mode into a minor mode by the end of the work.   In light of these five points, I think we can say with a fair amount of certainty that the eighteenth century viewed the minor mode as being inherently unstable. The minor mode could inject instability into pieces in the major mode. Meanwhile pieces in the minor mode virtually promised that we would have a very prominent cadence on a major chord and may even end in the major mode.   That's all we have evidence for. To put on my speculation cap, I would suggest that the properties of the minor mode itself engenders this treatment. If there's one thing the eighteenth century loved, it's leading tones. The minor mode, of course, does not have one, but one must be added via chromaticism. The introduction of #7 in the minor mode distorts the diatonic set, increasing the number of tritones from one to two and introducing an interval that the diatonic set does not contain: the augmented second (smoothing out this A2nd and one of the tritones by raising 6 introduces another tritone between #6 and 3). To get that leading tone requires us to introduce more instability into the macroharmonic collection (scale). On the other hand, it is very easy to ""slip"" into the key of the relative major: simply don't introduce the chromatic pitch that is the leading tone. If that happens, then the resolution of the diatonic tritone easily spits us out into the relative major. So, to keep the tonal center still, you have to distort the diatonic set. While smoothing out the diatonic set unlocks your tonal center and pushes you to the relative major.   That'd be how I'd explain ""why"" the minor mode was unstable. Of course, I am not saying that the minor mode is inherently unstable all the time. I'm saying that the features that the 18th century prized in their music rendered the minor mode unstable. So I'd add that disclaimer, because I don't think the minor mode is inherently unstable in other styles."

musictheory,3bkcpy,IPlayTheGuitar,10,Mon Jun 29 22:48:34 2015 UTC,"Form was the center of a huge struggle in the middle of the19th century for composers. Many who still upheld the sonata form often either stretched it out over a large format (see Franz Liszt ""Sonata in B Minor"")  or slightly altered the form to better fit their musical direction (see Dvorak Symphony 8 Movement 1).  The goal is to try to identify each section of the sonata form: exposition (first theme, transition, second theme, coda), development, and recapitulation, regardless of how obscure they are. A Bartok piece would be more difficult to identify due to his less tonal nature. The transitions and development in a tonal sonata are usually harmonically unbalanced, while the primary themes often stay in a single key. Though (as with the Franz Liszt example) this is not always the case, and sometimes sections of a sonata can have more than one key center. This is why most sonatas (or pieces that have sonata form such as the first movements of Symphonies) written after Beethoven require multiple listening or score study to really understand how the composer utilized the form.   Apologies for the lack of links, I'm on mobile right now. Also apologies for the wall of text, Sonata form is one of my favorite topics."

Once you know how the piece goes, it's easy to read the score without the music. Then you can confirm the sonata form (looking at the recapitulation's themes and see if it matches the expositions themes is what I do), and look for other details that might be difficult to identify without the score or a ton of listening"
musictheory,3bkcpy,japaneseknotweed,6,Mon Jun 29 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"A very analog answer to the form issue: highlighter markers.  Make a single-sided copy of the score. Highlight the main theme pink.

As to identifying the beginning/end of discrete sections once that lovely clarity of the Classical era starts smurging into Romanticism? That's a different issue.    When I was a kid, Brahms drove me NUTS. It sounded like someone who never quite finished his--  there'd he be going along on one melody and suddenly another one would-- four score and seven years ago our forefathers brought forth--  two all beef patties special sauce lettuce cheese-- goodnight Gracie. Like that.  And then I played lots of Brahms and suddenly it clicked, the same way a language sounds like muddle at first then finally separates into words.  My best advice? List chronologically.

At the time, Miles was seriously looking for musicians to replace some of the guys in the band with substance-abuse problems. So we sat down at the piano and played chords. I played a chord for him, and he asked me where I got it. I tried to show him where the chord came from. And he got very interested, because, by that time, I could translate any chord in terms of the Concept, and I could show Miles what its parent scale was; the scale formed a unity with the chord. Then Miles understood it. He saw that in the Concept there Modal Jazz and Miles Davis [57] was an objective explanation for the chord. He saw that the traditional music overlooked explanation for the chord. Unity was not a factor. When musicians are talking about harmony, they mean progressional harmony. They were ignorant—and still are—about a vertical concept. The Lydian Concept is based on the unity of chord and scale. That night, when Miles saw how he could use the Concept, he said that if Bird were alive, this would kill him.

Take a look at the cycle of 5ths, note how it starts on C, then goes around, towards the end sharps and flats start getting added, then out of nowhere, before it has reached C again, there is a natural F.... That natural F is the ""proper"" start for the cycle.  If you start there, diatonics becomes less meaningful, you're 99/100ths of a cent closer to Pythagorean tuning and can see the harmony from it's basis rather than from a perspective which is obsessed with ""amen"" cadence.  The contention being that Lydian is the true parent scale for the Major chord and in surveys of listeners is found to be the most well resolved.   This gives a flat foundation where no one harmonic perspective is any more important than the next. Harmony is a continuum matching it's spiral in nature against the flat circle of Equal Temperament. All choices are valid when seen vertically in their full 12 tone harmony.  Now instead of using the same scale across the board and playing modes off that, he creates a set of Lydian scales which one-by-one incorporate increasingly outside levels of Tonal Gravity (colour tones from higher up the cycle). So you can play Lydian, then add a tone to go further away, then add another, and another, then take them back out to return to the ""sun"" of the gravity concept. Modes of these scales can then produce any chord type including colour tones."

That shows a fair amount of facility/investment/interest.   But: at the same time OP either currently 1) can't identify the letters from the keyboard, or 2) can't recognize that E+B+B+E+G = Em, or 3) can't determine the key or 4) can't switch letters to numbers.

I quickly made basic transcriptions of the first four bars of each, with just the bass melodies and the chords (guitars sound an octave lower than written):  http://i.imgur.com/27A1jrk.png   They both start out with a motion from a minor tonic to what at first sounds like a V/ii—a major or dominant chord a fifth below the tonic chord. Instead of resolving down by fifth again to ii, both of them resolve by whole step (though Radiohead goes up while Sufjan goes down). Both have bass melodies built into the guitar picking pattern, emphasizing a half-quarter-quarter rhythmic motive. The contours of both bass melodies are the same. They both go step down, leap up, leap down. You can see in the transcription they even end in similar places, with narrower intervals.   So it's not the kind of ""so similar"" to the point where it's like ""Sufjan was ripping off Radiohead!!"" It's more like an affinity between the two melodies. Maybe a strong influence is there."

After that, it's just like the section before 3:38, it goes 6/8, 3/8, a bar of 7/8, but then it gets tricky. After that bar of 7/8, it goes to a bar of 8/8 that sounds like a mix of the 7/8 bar before it as well as the 2/4 bar that starts this section, but ends up as 8/8.  2:52 starting at the vocal entrance, the pattern sounds like 4/4, 6/8, 6/8, then an oddly syncopated 5/8, then 6/8, 8/8, 8/8, then maybe 7/8 or something close to that, and then the pattern repeats roughly the same thing. The bars right at 2:52 might be close to something like 8/8 then 10/8, or perhaps it's just a note that has a fermata that leads to the vocals.   After the section of 3:38 to the 8/8 bar, the song seems to go between a lot of time signatures based around 3 (3/8, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8) with intermittent bars of 2/8, 4/8 or 10/8. Starting after the 8/8, it goes 6/8, 10/8 twice, 6/8, 8/8, 16/8, 14/8, 10/8, 6/8, 3/8, 7/8, 12/8. Some of the larger time sigs. There can be split up, and the small ones combined. This should take you right to 4:20.  If you can't figure out from there, my advice would be to tap the eighth notes with a finger or hand, then count groups or phrases you hear (I was usually counting 1-2-3-4-5-6 1-2-3-4-5-6-1-2-1-2 for example at bars of 6/8 followed by 10/8).

It would be nice if there were a name that recognized that each acoustic scale shares 5 tones with a whole tone scale and 6 tones with an octatonic scale. Sadly I don't think that ""whoctatonic"" will ever catch on.   Of course, these modes are just one of 5 types which are made only of major/minor seconds with no adjacent leaps of a third or greater (the others being the normal church modes, whole tone scale, chromatic, and octatonic).

It makes it hard to learn how chromatic harmony works if you don't even understand how diatonic harmony works. You basically just figured out how diatonic harmony works and immediately applied that lesson to figure out chromatic harmony.   Keep experimenting and pick up some scores by Schubert, Brahms, Mahler, Wolf, and early Schoenberg to see how the masters expanded on voice leading and chromatic harmony over time."

musictheory,3bgoma,TravellingJourneyman,6,Mon Jun 29 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"Well actually now that I read up on it a little, I had been using chromatic harmony. I don't think that's the same as what I'm talking about.   I mean it in more in the way of single notes in a chord being used in a different way. Like if I played a C major chord, because the note G is used, logic would dictate that if I played an Ab major chord adjacent it would resolve in a sense, seeing as how the note G is the leading tone to the Ab major chord. The ""chromatic mediant"" point made by MiguelMarquezMusic is also valid, I was just wondering if this way of looking at things could also be considered relevant in any theory sense?"
musictheory,3bgoma,pwhiddlestone,8,Mon Jun 29 03:29:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is what I'm talking about. Leading tones (mostly) aren't a special thing. They're just the result of applying the most basic rules of smooth voice leading to cadences.  Consider the motion V-I. One note is held common, one note moves by half step, one note moves by whole step. Same with I-IV. They both have one note moving ""like a leading tone"", i.e., upwards by half step. Now consider the motion I-bVI. One note stays the same, one note moves upward by half step (like a leading tone) and the last moves downward by half step (which, if you studied modal counterpoint, is like the motion to the final in phrygian). The motion is very smooth and very strong. Using two pitches out of key makes for a rather surprising progression but it can easily be made to work well because of how smooth the underlying voice leading is. Brahms does that progression a lot."

For example, II-V in C major has the F#-G half step movement, but ii-V has only whole steps and a common tone. Is there something else going on, besides the common tone?"
musictheory,3bgoma,skinnyskittles1989,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, although the voice leading between ii and V is not as smooth, the two chords are related by a harmonic interval of a perfect fifth, which essentially means that the two chords have a strong connection to each other. (For more on this, read up on the overtone series)  Furthermore, this is also part of the reason an authentic cadence (V-I) is so satisfying, as the dominant is related to the tonic by a fifth. This concept is also illustrated by 'secondary dominance', so I suggest you read up on that aswell."
musictheory,3bgoma,vornska,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:58:52 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about your mention of the harmonic interval (i.e. the movement down a 5th in this case). Why is this the strongest according to the overtone series? Is it simply because it appears lower in the series? What's the order of ""strength"" or ""pull"" for harmonic intervals in between chords?"
musictheory,3bgoma,skinnyskittles1989,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:13:50 2015 UTC,Overtone series is irrelevant here. People mention it b/c it seems related somehow but it's not.
musictheory,3bgoma,vornska,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm curious then, what's it based on? And which intervals are stronger than others when it comes to harmony?"
musictheory,3bgoma,skinnyskittles1989,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"It's based on voice leading. V-I lets you harmonize the two most important melodic gestures at the end of a phrase: 2-1 and 7-1. More generally, root motion by perfect fifth allows for a good balance of contrary, parallel, and oblique motion. Root progression by thirds is less decisive because only 1 voice moves and 2 stay the same, whereas motion by step is clunky since all 3 voices need to move. So motion by fourth/fifth is kind of the sweet spot for nice chord-to-chord connections. (When dealing with diatonic chord progressions, steps, thirds, and fourths/fifths are the only 3 distinct options.)"
musictheory,3bgoma,vornska,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:29:13 2015 UTC,"What about when just dealing with the root movements and taking the voice leading out of the picture? For instance, is a movement of a 6th or 3rd more powerful and why?"
musictheory,3bgoma,Domdude64,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:30:40 2015 UTC,"Taking voice leading out of the picture root movement by 6th or by 3rd is identical. The only difference is whether your bass literally goes down a 3rd or up a 6th, which is a consideration of voice leading.  More generally, I don't think it's possible to make many true statements about chord progressions/root motions in the abstract. Different styles of music rely on different common progressions (like different idioms in a language), so the effect of a given progression depends on what style your piece is in, what style(s) your listeners are used to, and so on. Then there are also considerations of melody harmonization: does this sequence of 2 chords sit well under whatever melody I'm working with? Again that has less to do with root motion than with voice leading concerns.  Consider the popularity of the I, IV, V, and vi chords in a lot of pop/rock music. People are used to hearing those 4 as common sounds, so you can kind of juggle them in whatever order you want & still end up with a progression that sounds like music. I vi IV V might sound a little old fashioned (and it obeys classical-style grammar), and I vi V IV might sound a little rough, but the use of those four chords in an order guarantees a certain amount of coherence."

It's pretty rare and, if memory serves, it's typically the result of some other trickery (like a secondary relationship or something). Once you have the seventh, there's a half step down to the leading tone.  In any case, as others have mentioned, the root motion is so strong that it could carry just about any progression. Any root motion down a fifth, down a third, or up a second is going to help carry you forward, especially if the roots stay within the established key."

One thing you're exploring that I think may not have been mentioned explicitly is that you're exploring the concept of abandoning the home ""key"" - if you start in C major, you're able to get out of C major much more quickly (and much more unexpectedly) using the methods that you're exploring.

musictheory,3birob,rmonik,2,Mon Jun 29 15:50:43 2015 UTC,"piano ~0:50, Dm-Gm-Dm  The choice of 6th and 7th in minor scales is usually a good place to start for coloring minor melodies  From what I can hear the core of the melody is D Aeolian: D E F G A Bb C  Switch up the Bb for a B to get some extra flavor (when the piano melody goes up high on the register, I'm hearing this): D E F G A B C.  If you wanna get even more jazzy flip the C with a C# for melodic minor: D E F G A B C#. A Dminor-major 9th arpeggio like D F A C# E can sound pretty hip.  If you wanna get all classical on this piece throw in the Bb for some harmonic minor action: D E F G A Bb C#. You can mix and match to do things like E G B D | C Bb C# E | F  When playing the melody, end phrases NOT on D, F, or A, this causes a little bit of tension.  Voice the chords with 9ths. D F A C E for Dm and G Bb D F A for Gm  The opening I believe the bass is going from F# to F which given the context I would hear as D/F# | F. So the piano can riff on D major for the D/F# and then F major (D minor) for the F part."
musictheory,3birob,frajen,2,Mon Jun 29 16:54:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like he's superimposing different chords. Try playing a D major triad over Cmaj7. Or Fm7b5 over G7. Or an A major triad over a D minor triad. The key is to find superimpositions that avoid the root and/or the 5th of the original chord.

musictheory,3birob,BdaMann,-1,Mon Jun 29 22:06:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much random.  If it sounds random to you, then it probably is.  Humans are notoriously bad at creating randomness, so don't really think too much about it.  Figure out the shape you want to make, simulate a kind of random shake, and write it down.  Listen to it and figure out if it's random enough, and if not, maybe move a chord tone to another note.  Some things may also sound random but not actually be so.  I've written patterns using all ""extended"" chord tones and leading tones in order to sound mysterious, like b2's, #2's, #4's, b6's, etc., and as the mystery resolved over a couple of measures, the notes got closer and closer to the basic triad.  But they were nowhere near as quick as the flutter you're talking about.  That's probably a lot more random."

musictheory,3bfzma,Bigfrostynugs,12,Mon Jun 29 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"There is no ""should"".  Try it out, and let us know which you prefer!    However, to answer your question more directly, the bass, in many styles of music, usually plays the lowest note of the chord--so for an inverted chord voicing, the bass would play the lowest note in the inversion.  If the guitar is playing a C/E, and the bass plays a C, then the chord you're voicing is not really an inversion, as the lowest note is still the root.  Make sense?  You can play whatever you want on the guitar, but the choice of the chord root for the bass note ""cancels out"" your inverted guitar voicing."

musictheory,3bfzma,bad06denby,0,Mon Jun 29 07:32:46 2015 UTC,Baking is science.  Music [composition/performance/interpretation] is aesthetics.  Music theory attempts to make a science out of aesthetics... after the fact.
musictheory,3bfzma,young_mcdonald,3,Mon Jun 29 08:28:58 2015 UTC,"1) There is no ""should"" in music, but there is always context that needs to be taken into consideration. It's like going to a wedding: you can wear any number of things...as long as it ISN'T white!  2) In Jazz and Pop, the bass holds down the bottom. It can dance around in its own little world and as long as it gives you the feel you're after then don't sweat it. It wouldn't be a POPular genre if it wasn't layed back, simple, and easy. In classical on the other hand (the genre from which western theory was derived) an inverted chord is an inverted chord and should not be tampered with; if there's a third in the bass then it's there for a reason.  2) You have to understand why slash chords exist before you can understand the answer to your second question. Slash chords are shorthand for something very specific that the composer wants to happen, and they are only used in Pop (a genre which is not in any way shape or form standardized when it comes to theory). In Pop, you can generally interpret as you wish until you are specifically told to do something. Specific always trumps general (like in Dungeons & Dragons). If you play a root on your bass beneath a slash chord then no one is going to come knocking on your door, but you are probably missing the point of the slash chord!  3) Yes there will be a different feel to the different methods, but, more importantly, WHY are you choosing one or the other? When I compose, I choose notes based upon where I'm coming from and where I'm going to in the line being written. You don't just pick whilly-nilly. While the following statement could certainly be argued against, if you care about theory then you are probably trying to play a musical line that make sense both in the context of the composition AND while played solo. If your line sounds like random garbage when played solo then there'd better be a damn good reason for it, otherwise it's a shit line or a shit composition and something should be rewritten.  Trying to achieve this type of balance in your writing will ALWAYS get you satisfying results, while just doing whatever leaves everything up to chance. Once you are good at this, the choice of which note to play will be obvious."
musictheory,3bfzma,Edgar_Allan_Rich,5,Mon Jun 29 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"if the bass isn't playing the bass of the chord, it's not really inverted.  Unless you have something playing a lower frequency than the bass (rarely happens), the bass player is always the bass note."
musictheory,3bfzma,TNUGS,2,Mon Jun 29 01:25:23 2015 UTC,A lot of times when there are chord inversions it serve a stepwise bass line. I usually like to see if you can put the E in this example on the downbeat through a walk or run depending on what's appropriate for the song.

musictheory,3bfzma,tribebaldchest,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"A good way to accommodate inverted chords are with ground bass. How low can you go brother man? Say for instance I had a chord progression that was just Fmaj and Cmaj the whole time (not inverted chords, with equidistant phrasing); you could write C. a. G. F. At that point you are pretty much inverting the chords with the bass line. If you were to use any other inversions of Fmaj and Cmaj, that same bass line works in the same manner but would stress a different ambience or ""vibe"", for lack of a better term."
musictheory,3bfzma,nlaeae,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"The whole point of notating inversions is to give an actual bassline, and not just a bunch of chords without voicing. Generally the bassline is quite important, even more so than the chords themselves, so yes it should be played properly.  Of course, sometimes the original voicing is just not very good and then it makes sense to choose something different - but even then, it's a fairly big change."
musictheory,3bfzma,downtap,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:40:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of good answers here, but one note I'd like to make is taking into account the context of the inverted chord. Commonly, an inverted chord is used in creating a certain bass line. For example: C   C9/D  C/E Playing the proper inverted bass notes would cause the effect the composer intended. When I see an inverted chord, I almost always follow the intended bass note, but may play off of the actual chord root if it sounds good."

IV in a minor mode is achieved by raising the sixth, so it's a good way of making a song sound Dorian.  A song that does that is Mad World: the Gary Jules version is the most famous, but the original also uses IV(""and I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad"" is i-IV). The soundtrack of quite a few westerns does that too: like the Good, the Bad and the Ugly if I recall correctly.  Also, little nitpick: in A minor/dorian, GMaj is VII, not bVII. bVII is used in major rock songs, not minor."

Some people -- like possibly your music theory teacher, and my theory professor in college as well -- use VII to represent the chord built on the b7 scale degree when it's officially part of the scale, but common convention is to use bVII no matter what key you're in, especially because viio6 is still a common chord in minor, and that's based on the unaltered 7th degree, not the b7."

musictheory,3bf62u,xiipaoc,0,Mon Jun 29 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"The bVII in minor is diatonic, so there's no need to indicate it.   That can get real confusing real quick.  If you stick within the major/minor dichotomy, this is sufficient, but in modern music, even modern popular music, major and minor are inconsistent, so you want to notate unambiguously.  bVII is always the same chord no matter what mode you claim to be in.  Sure, technically the b7 is diatonic in minor, but the fact that I need to specify that it's minor means that the notation is extremely limited.  I personally consider the notes of the (natural) minor scale to be 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7, not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.  This way, I don't need to know what mode I'm in to disambiguate a bare 7, especially when it's not kept particularly clear in the first place.  It's always the same note."

We need to bring respect back to the guitar. It's a beautiful instrument that has had many opportunities in the music community as both a solid lead and rhythm instrument. If you know the instrument well enough, it's also great for four part voice writing."

You should take a look at Hit the Road Jack by Ray Charles. Although in the original track the i chord plays throughout the progression, you could still see it as a i VII VI V. If you were to play this progression with the chords you described, you could improvise over the top simply using a C minor or pentatonic scale, and even use a B natural over the V chord to give you a harmonic minor sound. Just something worth trying anyway :)"

If you know what you're doing, you can surprise a listener with nothing but the pitches of the major scale. What you want to do is learn how to organize the scale into chords, build chord progressions, then learn how to use chromaticism in a tonal context. A book like Tchaikovsky's Guide To The Practical Study of Harmony is a good place to start.   http://imslp.org/wiki/Guide_to_the_Practical_Study_of_Harmony_(Tchaikovsky,_Pyotr)  If you are interested in music that eschews diatonicism, I encourage you to listen to the music of Claude Debussy, whose pitch language often includes the whole tone scale, the lydian-mixolydian scale, and the requisite diatonic modes. At any rate, think in terms of chords rather than scales. A progression like F#m Am Cm D represents a whole world of harmonic color and does not arise from scalar thinking."

I've learned ""tricks"" from all of them that I then go on to use in my own compositions.  Beethoven taught me a neat way to use the neapolitan chord.  Chopin gave me Vsus4 V I.  Then we've got the unusual time signatures (among other things) from Genesis, the ""Carole Cadence"", Bonnie's IV bVdim I, and so on.

That said, in my own experience writing music, I find that you don't need a lot of unusual elements in order for music to sound less generic. You maybe want a mix of 90% usual, 10% unusual; or even 95%-5%. What's essential is finding the right place for the unusual moments. (Sadly, I'm not sure how to give advice about this, as I think it's something that must be learned through time and individual experimentation.)  Another thing to think about is which elements of the piece are unusual: melody, harmony, rhythm, or timbre/orchestration. If all of these elements are bizarre/unusual at the same time, the piece will probably sound harder to swallow than if just one of them is, at any given moment."

Actually I asked this question since I'm working on this process step by step and I'd like to make it as efficient as possible. I worked on rhythm reading pretty well and now I'm working on only pitches on a specific tempo and every time I'm feeling comfortable I increase the tempo (Of course in all keys). Until I reach reading quarter notes on 250 bpm (I just assumed that at that tempo I'll be comfortable to play directly without hesitation any note) I'll starting mixing both rhythm and pitch reading. Any other insights ?

musictheory,3bb1h9,stareyedgirl,2,Sat Jun 27 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"This poster is absolutely on point. The only way to truly get better at sight reading is the brute force method.    Like he said, grab a few etudes for your instrument. If you really want, pick up a sight singing book. 30 seconds to read over the excerpt, one attempt to sing through it and then play it on the piano to see how close you were. After this, it's no longer ""sight reading"", it's practicing.   I would still spend a few minutes on the passage, sing through it again with the aid of your keyboard and then work any sections or intervals that were difficult."
musictheory,3bb1h9,YourBrainOnJazz,3,Sat Jun 27 23:40:03 2015 UTC,"Really understanding the style of music that you are sight is definitely helpful, especially in pieces that are strongly rhythmic. I play classical and Brazilian guitar and there isn't a lot of overlap in those styles, except maybe in some moto perpetuo style choros. But with the Brazilian stuff, there are a number of chord progressions, chord shapes, and rhythms that are quoted by many composers. When you can spot those easily, it makes quicker work of sight reading.   A really important thing, and this may seem tautological, is to really know your instrument  so that you can quickly play any note or chord (or at least most any) in whatever position or fingering without having to hunt for it.  For years, even after study, I never attempted to memorize the notes on the neck of my guitar between VII and XII fret positions for the inner strings. This made it really cumbersome to sight read when the music used those positions. When I finally said fuck it and learned those positions, sight reading overall became much, much easier.   For songs with melodies and harmonies that are very chromatic and difficult to wrap my head around, I try to listen to a recording, multiple recordings if available, in order to understand what's going on musically, then go back to it. If my brain rejects the music, so will my hands.   Finally, a suggestion-and this not a sight reading suggestion exactly-that my guitar professor had been experimenting with was to learn a piece from the end and work backwards. The theory was that it would be easier to learn it if you already know where the music is going before it begins. I never took to it, but he liked it."

About your suggestion, I attended actually one day a workshop and the professor told us about it. It worked really well with the students who were learning a big band chart! Thank you for remembering me of it :)"
musictheory,3bb1h9,QueerandLoathinginTO,3,Sat Jun 27 15:49:03 2015 UTC,"The thing with sight reading is, you can't think fast enough while you're doing it to keep up with everything if you have a litany of note names, intervals, or chords running through your head.  You have to see something and your fingers have to know where it is before you do. That's not to say you don't need to know those things.  Knowing those things are the first step to your fingers knowing them, but you need to get to a point where you don't have to think them, to where it's in your fingers, not just your mind. And there's no shortcut to muscle memory other than practicing sight reading, fixing errors, and reinforcing the correct connections. (playing accurately, correctly, in time, with correct rhythms)  Rhythm training does help, especially if there are certain things that you feel uncomfortable with like syncopation or duple vs triple, or 16th subdivisions.  You're more likely to get it right in a piece if you're familiar with the rhythm.  If you have iOS, there's an app called readrhythm that I love for my students.  It's a lot like something we used to do in college, just sight-reading different rhythms and repeating them over and over again until you get them just right, and I KNOW everyone's playing improved because of doing that.  (Plus it's fun and satisfying to really nail a rhythm pattern.  There are few things that compare with really being in the groove of a good rhythm.)"
musictheory,3bb1h9,xiipaoc,2,Sat Jun 27 19:50:43 2015 UTC,"In the end, you don't want to think while sight reading. I play gigs professionally with very high caliber of sight readers with extremely complicated music, and if you think about anything other then staying focused on making music then you fail. It gets really bad too, I missed 1 articulation with a pro band and we were all sighg reading, and half the band turned around and gave me a really dirty look. Good professionals can literally sight read just about anything almost perfectly from the first glance.  tldr: Practice all the methods people described here, and sight read so much that it becomes second nature.

musictheory,3bb6ux,Xenoceratops,3,Sat Jun 27 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think of it in terms of surprising the listener. There are more effective things that you can do to catch people off guard that have little to do with harmony, such as getting really quiet and then doing a loud stab. That is more likely to scare the shit out of someone than an applied chord or whatever.  Progressions with lots of chromatic chords are not uncommon in classical music. In fact, big chains of chromatic chords and chord progressions are frequently encountered. That sort of thing can build tension, but I wouldn't look at it as a way of catching the listener off guard (even though it can). Make your decisions based on what is musically appropriate."

Enharmonic chords can add a significant amount of tension to a phrase, which can be resolved by returning to either a 1st, 5th or diminished 7th.    The diminished 7ths only half resolves the enharmonic tension, but acts as a bridge between distinctly different pieces and has the leading tone to resolve more greatly to the 1st.  That said, with everything in music, if it sounds and feels good, play it.  Analyze it to learn why it sounds good and you can reproduce the effect independently all over the fretboard!"

musictheory,3bcuui,setecordas,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:25:19 2015 UTC,"Basically, just increase the gain your midrange frequencies. Adding a bit of reverb can have the effect of both adding some highs and spatial depth.  Tonal variety in the parts along with stereo balance between the parts may also help with sonic separation. Too many effects at once on every tone along with complex eq can be detrimental to sound quality. EQ is best used to subtract frequency gain rather than add. That could also be an issue."

Since I have studied Jazz Piano , I prefer "" Suspended Pentatonic "" to Egyptian Pentatonic , since the name Egyptian is much too ambigous . Today´s Eygyptian music is heavily influenced by Arabic Music and the predominant scales seem to be "" Double Harmonic Major "" , Hijaz etc ( heavy use of the augmented second ) .  However , if anyone has researched ancient and contemporary Egyptian music more in depth and can provide some links to songs where the "" Suspended Pentatonic "" ( Raga Madhmad Sarang ) is used , I would be grateful to include it in my database .  The term "" suspended "" however makes a comprehensive connection with the sus-chord in Jazz Theory  , which does not contain the third of the chord .   What I have said about the Egyptian scale holds also true for the Man Gong and Ritusen scales : I can not find any sound clips featuring original East Asian instruments or singers playing these scales ( only didactic videos by western musicians playing the plain scales - not even one original Asian piece ...) .  Some lazy people even make sloppy lists and websites claiming that Ritusen is from Chinese music . Whereas if you dig deeper you´ll find that the more correct Japanese name is Ritsu . Anybody wanting to dig deeper into these matters will find articles where the Ritsu scale is mentioned together with the Ryo scale and how they interact with each other , but this would be a topic leaving the realm of pure Pentatonics .

The only purpose of a pentatonic scale is to provide a very basic outline of a chord (with a passing tone or two) that would be a part of a more full scale for which to create a melody or improvise. Limiting your modal studies to just pentatonic scales is somewhat pointless in the end.

musictheory,3b4phv,Composingcomposure,5,Fri Jun 26 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"the III chord in a major key is a secondary dominant, most commonly moving to a vi chord, as you've said, it makes the most sense following the V->i cadence. But following diminished substitution theory, a dominant chord has a few other resolution options - down a half step (bII->I) aka the tritone substitution, up a tone (bVII->I) aka the backdoor, as well as the less common III->I resolution.  It's called diminished substitution theory, as each of those dominant chords relates to an overarching diminished 7 chord (bII, III, V, bVIII - eg Db, E, G, Bb).   But we're working in the opposite direction, so our secondary dominant chord (assuming E) can move to    A (V->I) C (III->I) Eb (bII->I)  F# (bVII->I)    You can choose any quality, major, minor or dominant, depending on where you want to go next in your chord progression.  But wait there's more!  We can use common tone substitution on any of those chords to produce even more possibilities! Take Creep for example. I -> III - > IV. Well a IV chord is very closely related to a vi chord as it turns out   IVmaj7 F - A - C - E vi7  .........A - C - E - G   So for any of our resolving chords, we can move up or down the stack of thirds to create a common tone substitution. Obviously some chords will work better than others, also depending on your overall context. Here's some progressions you could try out   I III vi II iv I (georgia on my mind) I III IV iv (creep) I III #iv VII biio I I III bIII ii V I I III #V I (parallel major thirds)"
musictheory,3b4phv,mharray,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:54:41 2015 UTC,"I'm of the opinion that we should be careful only to assign ""dominant"" function when the sonority is dominant in structure. In my opinion, III is not a secondary dominant in major. III7 would be, and this is because of the minor 7th creating tension within the sonority to resolve to vi. We would call the III chord in major a chromatic mediant."

musictheory,3b4phv,Morgoth714,3,Fri Jun 26 00:45:58 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd come up with a more out-of-the-box solution. You could treat it as a neapolitan chord, especially in first inversion. Follow the III with bVII, and if possible, step the root down by half-steps from 3, through b3, to 2. From there you can go to vi by resolving the b7 and b6 (if you want a seventh) inward like a German augmented sixth, or you could resolve to biii or bIII and work from there.  Off the top of my head, here's an unusual progression involving III in major:  I - V - III6 - #v - bVII7 - vi - II7 (V7/V) - V7 - I"
musictheory,3b4phv,RiverStrymon,4,Fri Jun 26 02:25:25 2015 UTC,"The I-III-vi is the ""Stevie Wonder minor turnaround"" in my personal musical lexicon. Especially when it's augmented, my eyes just roll back in my skull. I'll keep my ears out for a III not used to pass back to vi."
musictheory,3b4phv,Muesdix,2,Thu Jun 25 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"not OP but I would assume (s)he means III+, meaning the tonic is held across all 3 chords."
musictheory,3b4phv,ckaili,4,Fri Jun 26 12:49:06 2015 UTC,"III is not a very common chord in major.  Usually you see V/vi.  That's because the III chord has the #5, which kind of breaks the tonality of the key by altering the 5; that #5 pretty much has to go to 6.  So one thing you do see pretty often is I - V/vi - IV, which is basically a deceptive cadence in the key of the vi.  That middle chord is still a secondary dominant -- it's a V/vi, not a III, but in this case you could actually argue the other way -- but it resolves irregularly.  You could also use a regular iii and... actually modulate to it.  You can do that because I is actually the bVI of iii, so it's a simple progression to do I - V/iii - iii because it's bVI - V - i in the key of the iii.  The Super Mario World Ending Theme, on the other hand, fakes this out.  The verse goes I - V+7/iii - v6 - V7/ii, and that resolves irregularly to IV - #ivo - I64 - V7/ii - ii9 - V+ and back to the beginning of the verse to I.  The first four chords are the important bit.  In C, you have chords going C E G, B D# G (A), Bb D (E) G, A C# G.  There's chromatic movement and it's also a sequence and it also features some unexpected resolutions.  Great stuff."

musictheory,3b4phv,arxeef,2,Fri Jun 26 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"Traditionally the III chord functions as a V/vi, which is why we so often we see it resolving to the vi chord, but there's no reason we can't stick a viio/vi, viio7/vi or a viiø7/vi between the V/vi and the vi (and we all know what dim7 chords allow us to do!), that allows us to modulate to the bV, bIII, or VI. As an example, we could go:  ||: I - V43 | V/vi - vii+2/vi | vi6 - ii | V7 - I(no5) :||  Or...  ||: I - V/vi | vii+2/vi - bV | vi/bV - ii6/bV | viio7 - I :||  Or...  ||: I - V/vi | viio7/vi - bIII | vi/bIII - ii/bIII | viio7 - I :||  Another way to think about it would be to treat that III as a rootless Dbm7 and see where that leads you."

The V doesn't follow too well to my ears, unless it was for melodic purposes, because its a little similar. Same for dim7 in the inversions I played on guitar, at least. It resolves great back to the I.   The relative minor key would call this chord a V. I find that all of the chords have similar relationships as their relatives in their own key. There is some dominant flavour on that chord for sure.  I personally think it is a mistake to change their number values to correspond to function.

musictheory,3b5iny,tarkus6599,22,Fri Jun 26 03:30:29 2015 UTC,"The difference is the function. A German A6 will have the characteristic augmented sixth resolve out by semitone to an octave, so in C the Ab and the F# would both resolve out to a G. Holding the other two notes makes a cadential 6/4 chord, which then typically goes to the V, then I. An Ab7, on the other hand, is the V7 of Db, and would resolve typically to its relative tonic with the tritone between the chordal 3rd and chordal 7th resolving inwards to the root and chordal third of Db. It's true that they're enharmonically equivalent, but they function differently. The ambiguity due to the enharmonic equivalence is actually a really cool use of augmented 6th chords (and the German A6 in particular). You can trick the listener by setting up a dominant seventh and reinterpreting it as a German A6 or vice versa!"
musictheory,3b5iny,torchflame,3,Fri Jun 26 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"Because hearing a scale degree as #4 isn't the same thing as hearing it as b5. If you hear the note wanting to resolve upward to 5, then you are hearing it as #4, if you are hearing it wanting to resolve down to 4, you are hearing the note as b5.  What we name notes as has everything to do with how we interpret what is going on. A Ger+6 has scale degrees b6, 1, b3 and #4: we want that sharp note to discharge upwards. It would be a different thing to really hear it as b6, 1, b3 and b5. And it would be super different to hear it as #5, #7, #2, and #4. All these things are the same when it comes to pushing buttons on a keyboard. But music is more than the buttons we push."
musictheory,3b5iny,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:30:25 2015 UTC,So is the Ger+6 chord always built on the b6 scale degree? Is it usually proceeded by the V?
musictheory,3b5iny,GirTheRobot,2,Sat Jun 27 14:25:19 2015 UTC,"So is the Ger+6 chord always mostly built on the b6 scale degree? Is it usually proceeded by the V?   Yes, most commonly an augmented sixth chord is a predominant built on scale degree b6 and resolves to a dominant chord. However, especially in the 19th century, composers built augmented sixth chords on scale degrees other than b6, such as b2 (e.g., Schubert, ""Der Doppelgänger""; Schumann, ""Heiß' mich nicht reden""; Brahms, Symphony No. 4 Finale; Brahms, Op. 76/4). In such a case, rather than the aug. 6th resolving to the dominant (like a chromatically-altered V/V to V), the aug. 6th has a dominant function and resolves to the tonic (like a chromatically-altered V to I)."
musictheory,3b5iny,RyanT87,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes. One of the basic derivations of the augmented 6th (the It+6) is by taking a iv6 chord in minor and adding in a chromatic passing tone (moving 4 - #4 - 5, with the 5 accompanied by a resolution of 6 to 5 in the bass ). So they always carry with them that function. Or at least in all normative cases."
musictheory,3b5iny,nmitchell076,3,Sat Jun 27 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"What torchflame said is correct. To add on, alternative spellings and naming of chords almost always has to do with function. Augmented sixth resolves outward, sevenths resolve down, Neapolitan resolves to V etc. If the naming is different than you would expect, it's because it's function is different."
musictheory,3b5iny,arhombus,4,Fri Jun 26 12:29:31 2015 UTC,"The German 6th is by far one of my favourite chords. Really gives a juicy sort of feeling when it leads to the cadence, I'm not sure how else to describe it.   But if you're trying to distinguish chords aurally without any context, you can certainly be a smartass and say, ""Hey, isn't that a German 6th,"" rather than a dominant 7th. I wouldn't."

It's what it sounds like—you just go directly into a new key without smoothing it over. Things like common chord or common tone modulation are just ways of smoothing the modulations. They're not rules for modulation. You can have un-smooth modulations. They're great for bumping up energy."

Two projects I'm working on now involve using tetrads for short pieces of music, in other words, using only four pitches for the entire piece, which limits the harmonies in the piece. The other project involves writing for several instruments each using a different pentatonic scale, so only five notes each.  I'd recommend listening to Ligeti's Musica Ricercata, The first piece uses mainly one pitch class, and gradually the pieces build up to using all 12 notes of the scale.  I'd also reccomend listening to Shostakovich's Fugue in A major. This piece uses only triadic harmony, so there is absolutely no dissonance throughout the piece.  I've only just looked back to what you've written, what I've said probably isn't relevant to you, but I'll leave it here anyway. :)"
musictheory,3b5b7w,Telope,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:22:33 2015 UTC,"I think I try to avoid ""simple"" chord progressions mainly because of some strange desire to write more unique and interesting music. It's hard to explain. I feel like writing without any sense of chromaticism, modulation or secondary functions leaves my music sounding boring and uninspired. Obviously that's not always true -- some of the best music out there is relatively straight-forward harmonically.  Honestly I think it's a bad habit to think like this. I'm trying to shift my mindset more to thinking of the chords I could potentially move to (assuming tonal music of course) as choices. Knowing about secondary function chords, modulations, etc just opens more doors for you. Sure, most of the time you'll take that I-vi-IV because your piece demands it, but knowing that I-V7/ii-ii6 with that same bass line is a possibility means you're consciously choosing not to do that.  One thing that's helped me is to not think of writing tonal music as exclusively in a mode (like major or minor) but as simply the bare bones: a tonic and a dominant note. From there you have triads and seventh chords on EVERY chromatic note that all have certain tendencies and functions. You can even break the pitches down to have leading tendencies and construct your own chords/sets. I've found this way of thinking to be extremely intimidating but also quite liberating."

It's as if they need to show off just how talented and knowledgeable they are by eschewing simple ideas to the point that some go so far as to get into ridiculously avant garde drivel.  ""I'm going to eat vegetables... then throw up on a large staff and see if I can make tone rows from where the chunks of corn and carrot land.""   People try too hard to view themselves as John Cages or Jackson Pollocks.  Sure, not everyone takes it quite this far and that sort of example is on an extreme end of the spectrum, but it is to the point of how a lot of people approach their music.  They need to show off the utmost of their talent to everyone so that nobody thinks they are a hack.  Trumpet players needs to play high and pianists need to play fast, etc.  And for the most part, this will do its job... it will impress the most easily impressed people, or at least their peers who think they are being musically edgy, but it won't always makes the best or even most enjoyable music.  I think it's dangerous to get in the mindset that once you've learned something more complex that you should never venture into using other simple things in a masterful way.  Also, from a marketing standpoint, enjoyment matters more than being impressive.  There's only a niche of people who give a shit about your ultra impressive stuff.  People like catchy and enjoyable.

Ex the melody is an 'A' over an Fmaj chord, an easy harmony would be a F or C.  When the melody isn't a chord tone, you can play around with what sounds best, usually intervals of 3rds or 6ths are safe use.

Eg: c major a voice would be on a c, e, g, and the c an octave above, where would the other voice sit? Thanks!"
musictheory,3b1its,iambored456,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:33:47 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, that's a whole other can of worms. One of the tricks a group like Pentatonix would use are 'suspensions', and that is when a harmony from a previous chord tone 'leaks over' into the next chord before 'adjusting' into the current chord. Ex, a Cmaj chord going to an Fmaj chord; holding the E from the Cmaj chord overtop the Fmaj chord, THEN moving it to F, sounds pretty darn cool.  When you get further into theory and start learning more types of chords then they can have 4 notes. For example, if you add a 'C' ontop of a Dmin chord, it becomes a Dmin7 chord (the C is a 7th above the root note, D, therefore, Dmin7). This particular chord is used in a lot of pop music so you may recognize it. In your example try keeping the C from the Fmaj chord and hold it all the way through Dmin chord.  But! The voices don't always have to be in 4 parts, it's not the end of the world if two voices are on the same note (it's especially okay if they're an octave apart). Just avoid unison as much as is convienant for you, and always goes with what sounds best. This hasn't been the most thorough explaination but it should get you experimenting before you decide to pick up a book or two."

musictheory,3b1its,jesusofnazers,3,Sat Jun 27 00:20:16 2015 UTC,"To ""harmonize"" your melody, a simple solution could be to copy the melody up a third or a sixth and follow along in-key. However, making your harmonies fit within each chord may take some extra thought.  For instance, the note F can be in any of the first three chords, can go to E for final chord, and can rise back to F afterwards. This F can follow along rhythmically but doesn't imitate melodically."

musictheory,3b01dw,EnterpriseNCC1701D,8,Wed Jun 24 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"Time for some vocabulary:  Note: a note is a musical sound that we can give a  description to. ""This note is an A, that note is a C#."" We could say that's a high note or a low note; a long note or a short note; a loud note or a quiet note. When we say ""that note is a C,"" we are just saying what ""flavor"" that note has. It could be a very low C or a very high C, but these would all be notes named ""C.""  Pitch: A pitch is a specific frequency. Instead of saying ""that's a C,"" we could say ""that's middle C."" Or we could say it's C2 or C4 or ""The C above the staff."" These are all ways to refer to a specific pitch.  Piano Key: A piano has 88 keys. Each key plays a specific pitch. This is using the word ""key"" in the same way as a computer keyboard. It's something you press with your finger. A piano has several keys which play the note ""F,"" but each one plays a unique pitch.  Key: (as in a musical key, or a key signature, or ""in the key of...""). When a song is in a certain key, it is as you say--that note is homebase. If a song is in the key of B major, then the note B is the homebase. Here's the important bit (and the answer to your question): Every note B is homebase, not any specific B. In other words, a musical key refers to a note, not a pitch.   In a band there will be many different instances of any note. The bass player will play low notes, the guitar player will play higher notes. They might both play the note B (but in different octaves) and both of them are doing their part to establish homebase. Each and every B is homebase if in the key of B.   TL;DR every B on the piano is homebase. When a song is ""in the key of B,"" that refers to the note B, not the pitch B."

Key in the sense of the bit of ivory that you're touching on the piano and key in the sense of a system of notes do not really mean the same thing. Thanks to something about the way our neurons process sound, we (or at the very least, those of us who abide by the conventions of western music) generally consider any of those b keys to be the tonic center of the key of B, thanks to the fact that they they sound (more or less) the same, because of octave equivalency."
musictheory,3b01dw,beiaard,3,Wed Jun 24 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"OK, so imagine you're doing cartwheels. You start off standing upright. You do one cartwheel toward the right, and you're upright again. You're not standing in the same position on the floor where you were before, but you're upright again, so in that sense you've returned to a ""home"" position.  Keys are sort of like that. Playing that one note (the note that is the tonal center for the key) is like being upright. You can be in other positions, but ultimately things are kind of focused on getting you back to that position. You wouldn't end a gymnastic routine standing on your head, unless maybe you were trying to be cute about it.  Where the analogy falls apart is that in music you can change keys, which would be like changing which direction is up. Obviously without an artificial gravity generator that isn't possible when doing cartwheels."
musictheory,3b01dw,adrianmonk,4,Thu Jun 25 01:19:39 2015 UTC,"You seem to think that Key as in ""Key Signature"" and key as in ""88 Piano Keys"" are the same thing. They are totally different.  When a song is in a certain Key it means that there is a certain selection of notes that fit together in the system. They harmonize with eachother. If a song is in the key of (or system of ) B major, then there are only 7 Notes that sound appropriate in that song. B major, for example, has: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, and A#. Those Notes are in The Key of B major. The Tonic Chord, or I Chord, is B, so a B should be the center of your playing on the piano.(Provided the song is in the Key of B.) If the song was in C major, the Key would contain the notes: C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. In C major, C is the Root chord ( the I chord) so C would be the best center for your hands. If you were to play a note that is not in the key, it will clash and sound wrong. Like it doesn't belong. In C major, for example, playing a C# note would cause dissonance (Clashing Sound.) Notes that fall outside of a given key are called Enharmonics. It will take time and practice to learn which notes belong in which keys but there are tons of tools on the internet that help with that sort of thing so don't be afraid to look up a chart or something. I hope this helps you. Good luck."

A piece ""in the key of B"" will have a tonal center surrounding any of the B's on the keyboard, as they produce the pitch of B regardless of their octave and given that they are tuned correctly (electric keyboards are 99% of the time tuned correctly).   Just like if you play the same song on Guitar or Violin: Any of the pitches which are equivalent to B will tend to feel as though they are the foundation of the piece which is played within the Scale of B.  A key signature simply designates which accidentals will be played for the entire piece as a given from the very beginning or point where the key signature appears.  If a piece is ""in the key of C major"" it means that there are no given accidentals in the beginning and that the piece shall begin with a centre within any C Major scale on the instrument.  :)"

The ""Key of C"" is just a way of saying that the piece of music will be written and played within the scale of C Major across the entire piece of music and across the entire keyboard.  The Scale of C Major is  C, D, E, F, G, A, B --> C ,D, E, F...  (Ad Infinitum)  The basic Chords used within C Major are:  C G E C   I    Major d f a d      ii   minor e g b e     iii  minor F A C E    IV  Major G B D G   V   Major a c e a      vi  minor b d f b      vii  diminished  Playing ""in the Key of C"" means you'll be using these chords pretty much exclusively.  At least in a classical sense, like from circa:1600-1880, unless you change the tonal centre within the middle of the piece of music. A lot of classical forms require this, and Sonata Form is well known for this.   It's quite common to use chords outside of the key signature within modern music."

In D# Major, that is D# In g minor, that is g.  In a minor, that is a.  In eb minor, that is eb.

musictheory,3b01dw,iopenatthenose,2,Thu Jun 25 14:43:41 2015 UTC,"There's a distinction between a pitch and a pitch class. This is something that is usually too specific to bring into these conversations, but it might help your confusion.   A pitch is a specific note on the keyboard, so middle C is a different pitch from C an octave above. A pitch class refers to all of the pitches that have the same letter name, so middle C and the C an octave above are both the same pitch class (which essentially means ""these are both Cs, so they are more similar to each other than to any other pitch class).   Think about the difference between a piano keyboard, where middle C and the C an Octave above are located physically in different places. And compare that to what we call ""the pitch class clock face,"", where there is no octave information, and there's only one thing you can call C. So the different octaves, which are physically in different spots on the piano, are, when translated onto the clock face, all located in the same place. That's the difference between pitch and pitch class.   When we speak of keys as a ""home base,"" we tend to think of the center being a pitch class. This means that we don't distinguish between pitches in the different octaves. You can close on any C and it would feel just as closed off.   However, there are cases where we think of pitches rather than pitch classes being centers. For these pieces, it would matter what octave you end in. We say these pieces have an ""obligatory register."" This means we feel that there is a certain register, a certain area of the keyboard that feels more secure and stable than other octaves.   So recognize that these are two different things. To say something is in a key is to say that a pitch class is heard as a home base. To say a piece has an obligatory register is to say that a pitch is heard as a home base."

It may feel that way to a beginner, because a beginning pianist is not going to be moving their hands around a keyboard a lot. So very basic music may start and end on middle C, but that is not because middle C is the ""home key"" for C major. Being in the key of C Major means that any C or C chord will feel like ""home,"" no matter which octave it is. A piece might start at the bottom of the keyboard and jump all around and eventually end on a C chord near the top of the keyboard, or vice versa. The only thing that's restricting which octave you play is the sheet music itself, which tells you which specific key on the piano to press at a specific point in time. But a composer can choose to write a piece of music in any octave he wants. There is no rule he has to follow that dictates when notes will be low and when they will be high. Improv artists will go off the sheet music and move melodies around to different octaves, also.   The only thing ""key of B Major"" means is ""these notes and chords are going to sound right together."" But those notes and chords can be played in any octave at any time."

No. I mean, the song isn't really ""in"" an octave because if it moved up and down it wouldn't be in that octave anymore, ya know? But that isn't my point. My point is that middle C is STILL a ""home base."" Middle C is ALWAYS your home base.  When people say keys are a home base it's about harmony, which is something you can work out later. (The key of ""B"" would be I, and the chords would always lead back to ""B"" because that's your home.) For now your main focus is finding the right notes to play, yes? So say you have a B below the staff. Find your Middle C on the keyboard. The B you want is the B below it. I'm sure you know this already, but I just want to help ingrain into you that when you're looking for notes on the keyboard, MIDDLE C IS YOUR HOME BASE.  Look at your B in the middle of the staff. (Assuming we're in treble clef.) Now look at your keyboard. Find middle C. The B in the middle of the staff is the one 7 notes above middle C. That's it, that's really it.

In their standard inversions, played by themselves on a piano, I would say they all (7th, 9th, 11th, 13th) sound pretty jazzy. Major 7 based chords sound more ambient and dominant 7th based chords sound more bluesy. It really depends on your definition of mood.

By the way, French augmented 6th would be Ab C D F#, usually resolving to something like GCEG, then GBDG, then CCEG. If you have a piano handy, I'd recommend checking it out. There's also German augmented 6th, which is Ab C Eb F# and resolves the same way. The fun thing about the Ger+6 is that's it's enharmonic to Ab7, so you can play with that a little. Sometimes composers like to approach a Ger+6 as if it's a 7th, and it plays a trick on your ears."

musictheory,3az7ho,LarryLarington,3,Wed Jun 24 18:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think the most suggestive portion of the article was by far Stankis's discussion of the interrupted circle motif in general.  I was particularly fond of this passage:   [2.7] Within the context of two-dimensional gridlines, the interrupted circle is like a scope or camera lens that helps the viewer or listener develop degrees of empathy with an object. Imagine a piece of visual art, literature, or music immersing you within the immediacy of an intimate moment or reverie (represented by the circle). Then, this moment abruptly changes as if suddenly awakening (represented the line), as if a fluttering butterfly unexpectedly comes to rest in the palm of your hand. The linear interruption makes you increasingly aware of the circular or enclosed aspect of the moment. This stimulates a simultaneous sense of immediacy and detachment or objectivity. If the butterfly lingers you might be able to snap a photograph. The intimate sensation of the moment becomes two-dimensionally concrete in the captured image of the butterfly. Then, you may begin contemplating the suggested meanings of the butterfly’s beauty, its lines, its curves, and its colors, as if it were a stained-glass window in miniature.   The idea of the circular and the line representing two different kinds of engagement with an artwork is interesting, and I think this discussion sheds new light on old discussions.  In particular, I'm reminded of Susan McClary's ""Getting Down off the Beanstalk: The Presence of a Woman's Voice in Janika Vandervelde's Genesis II,"" chapter 5 of Feminine Endings. Compare Stankis's discussion cited above to the following passage by McClary regarding the Vandervelde:   These two contrasting types of music are extremely rich in metaphorical implication.  The cyclic properties of the clockwork resonate with the patterns of nature: seasonal yet timeless, always fascinatingly different and yet always the same.  Up against the natural ebb and flow of the clockwork, the string parts are clearly marked with the gestures associated in tonal music with self-determination, with the ongoing struggle of human endeavor.   McClary and Stankis both tackle the differences between ""circular"" and ""linear"" musical gestures, how they can intersect, and whether they can coexist.  I think Stankis's article is a fine contribution to that conversation (which also includes Karol Berger's Bach's Cycle, Mozart’s Arrow), and I think these two essays would be nicely read in light of each other.  What I'm less convinced of is the utility of the work she goes through to translate musical gestures into brush strokes.  I think the spirit is right, that we can conceptualize auditory events as brush strokes and that it can be at times useful.  But, I don't know, I just felt like there was something... missing from the discussion that made it feel like it just missed being really interesting.  But I don't know.  I'd love to hear other thoughts about this part (see the analytical appetizer from last week).  People who were really excited by it, what did you like so much about it?  I'd love to be convinced that my reservations are just my own, and that what she's doing with that section is more interesting than I think."
musictheory,3axlfu,heidavey,12,Wed Jun 24 08:53:49 2015 UTC,"There are multiple ways to word this, and it may get messy, so skip to the TL;DR if you'd like!  (1) Let's think of C major as the collection of major/perfect intervals above C. For instance, a major second above C is D, a M3 above is E, a perfect fourth is F, etc. This gives us the collection CDEFGAB.  (2) Now, let me explain modes in a slightly different way: in your example, you're basically cycling C to become all of the different locations within a scale (we call these locations ""scale degrees""). In C Ionian, we use the C Major collection, and C is scale degree 1 in C Major. In C Dorian, we use the Bb Major collection, and C is scale degree 2 in Bb Major. In C Phrygian, we use the Ab Major collection, and C is scale degree 3 in Ab Major, etc.   In paragraph (1) above, we collected the major/perfect intervals above C. In paragraph (2), we're collecting the major/perfect intervals below C, since we're finding the major scale in which C is that scale degree. For example: In C Dorian, we use the Bb Major collection, and C is scale degree 2 in Bb Major. Since C is scale degree 2 in Bb Major, Bb is a major second below C.  TL;DR: All this is to say that C Major and Ab Major are mirror images (inversions) of each other. CDEFGAB is the collection formed from a major second above C (D), M3 above C (E), P4 above C (F), and so on. Ab Major is the collection formed from a major second below C (Bb), M3 below C (Ab), P4 below C (G), and so on.  As a little ""homework"" assignment: what is the mirror image of the Dorian scale?"
musictheory,3axlfu,musicpilot,9,Wed Jun 24 11:15:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, such a great answer. I understand it completely. Thanks!   As a little ""homework"" assignment: what is the mirror image of the Dorian scale?   Well, the dorian scale has M2, m3, P4, P5, M6 and m7.  I can build the mirror scale by inverting all those intervals and taking them above the starting note (because that is the same thing).  M2 → m7, m3 → M6, P4 → P5, P5 → P4, M6 → m3, and m7 → M2.  So the mirror of the dorian scale is the same dorian scale.  Cheers, I really appreciate your answer."

One interesting thing I found was that if you follow the relationship between C Major and Ab Major (i.e. I --> bVI), treating Ab Major as the tonic, you can get back to C Major in 3 steps:  C Major (I) --> Ab Major (bVI) --> E major (bVI/bVI or III) --> C Major (bVI/III or I)   In other words, if you recursively ""mirror"" an major scale, you return to the same major scale with the progression I --> bVI --> III --> I."

It just then depends on which mode it is by figuring out which step it started on away from the normal Ionian/major scale. So if it was played on the first step, it's ionian, second step, it would be Dorian, and if it was played on the 5th step from ionian, it would be Mixolydian.

You wanted the 2/7 to form a consonant interval, specifically, the minor 3rd. In every mode except Phrygian, adding in the leading tone poses no problems: as that 2/7 remains a consonant interval. But in Phrygian, adding in the leading tone turns that 2/7 into a diminished 3rd, so it's no longer consonant. So they just said ""yikes, that'd be ugly. Well, then we won't raise the leading tone for this mode."" So you still keep the idea of ""surround the incoming tonic note by a whole step on one side and a half step on the other,"" you just swap where those are in Phrygian."

musictheory,3axy93,southern3star,2,Wed Jun 24 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"The Aeolian mode doesn't have a raised 7th (eg ABCDEFGA). Using a raised 7th creates the Harmonic minor scale( eg ABCDEFG#A) and is in fact the difference between the two. The raised 7th is now the leading note and can provide better harmony because there is a stronger pull to the tonic, and because the V chord (the dominant) is now a major chord (eg EG#B) instead of a minor chord (eg EGB) which can give a more final sounding cadence in V-I."

They figure that music theory is the sort of reasoning that has uncovered everything that ""works"" and doesn't, and therefore for any sort of thing one can do, there is an establish position on whether or not that will sound good.   Which is not far off from the truth, but is ultimately false.   In this case though, the question I think, if phrased correctly, is a good one. The question being, in natural minor, it is common to sharp the 7 of the key, which is the 3rd of the v, making it a V, which gives a nice strong functioning dominant sound. Is it like that in every minor key?   That's really what the question ought to be, because music theory, at the end of the day, is not the grand design of what is or isn't possible, what is or isn't correct, what does or doesn't sound good. It is the names of sounds, and that is it, and the function of a sound, is part of that.  What I hate the most about questions phrased like this, and you hear it all the time, is that it promotes the idea to people that don't know theory, that theory is some sort of suggestions of what to do, or limitations on imagination, which makes them not want to learn to theory.   It's all a big misunderstanding, that people think theory is what it isn't. And that's because a lot of people use it as it should not be used, really, imo. As a reason for deciding what to do, in order to make music that ""works"" instead of letting your creativity do its thing and using theory as a means to turn those ideas into a reality other people can hear.   But, at the end of the day, I'm cool with people doing that, I mean, if using theory that way makes you happy and you enjoy making music that way, then go for it. The more people that enjoy listening and making music the better. I don't' really care how you like to do it.

So ""pass the whatever the hell you pass whether it's s&p or butter"" is basically just a way of reminding your brain that there are going to be a couple of fairly long-ish lilty bits and then a scottish-snap type feeling at the end (but not that exact).   But yeah, I agree that in the end, you do have to just think about it as a larger picture, and it also depends dramatically on the context as to how exact your polyrhythms need to be. Most people can feel the concept of a polyrhythm without it being exactly what is written (and sometimes, that's the point - composers don't always intend for you to be completely exact). After a certain point, I do think you'd have to be insane to work out the exact rhythm, and I guarantee you an audience can't tell if your 7:11 isn't quite on point."

musictheory,3ay0sl,Koorutheguru,9,Wed Jun 24 12:20:50 2015 UTC,"I listen to a lot of EDM. The ""music theory"" answer to your question is tension and release.  The 8-16 bars (the ""build-up"" or ""tension"") prior to the ""drop"" typically involves a high pass filter sweep. This means that the low frequencies of the song (kick drum, bass line) are made quieter over time, leading to a sense of ""groundlessness"" which people might consider tense or unstable. Meanwhile, there is a common tendency in a lot of drops to have quarter notes turn into 8th notes turn into 16th notes etc. especially with the snare or equivalent type instrument. This builds up rhythmic tension as the song moves from slow rhythm to faster rhythm. Occasionally there is some kind of harmonic dissonance as well; for example a common effect is to slide the pitch of a synthesizer upwards during this build-up phase.  Then there is occasionally some kind of catchy hook during a 1 or 2 bar pause.  Then the ""release"" happens with the reintroduction of the kick drum (usually at peak volume) and other key instruments (bass line, lead synth melody). The low frequencies return to provide a sense of stability.  A lot of popular EDM uses a bunch of reverb to create the effect that you are listening to the song in a large stadium or hall.  The concept of tension and release is not new. Simple example - find any piece of music that has a V-I progression. For example  Play this G7 chord: G B D F B F  Then play this C major chord: C E G C E G   The G7 is the tension, and the C major is the release.  What you're noticing about the ""big room drop"" is that this tension and release process takes quite a bit of time. There's not much subtlety to the tension or release aspects of many EDM tunes - a lot of times the movement is specifically lined out in the song structure, possibly to help listeners or dancers follow along. On the other hand, a V-I progression in classical or blues music could happen in half a second or faster, similarly a ii-V-I progression in jazz could happen in a second or less as well.   EDM’s major contribution to modern music is undoubtably the “drop”   I have to agree that this is a bit of a wild statement. I think the major contributions to modern music coming from electronic dance music are the introduction of unique timbres through synthesizer/sound design and the associated technology (both software and hardware). IMO, ever since musique concrete (and arguably before that too), technology coming from the electronic space has been the #1 thing that pushes revolutions in modern music  hope this helps"
musictheory,3ay0sl,frajen,3,Wed Jun 24 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"This is a question relating to the driving force inspired by rhythm, not harmony.

If were in the key of C, Fm, Bb7, Abmaj7, Dbmaj7, Amaj7, G7b9, Dm7b5 etc. all have that note. They are also all common ways to include it in modern harmony. It's just naturally a tension note that is non-diatonic. Check out any tune from the Great American Songbook (Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rogers & Hammerstein) and they will use this note in some regard.   It is commonly used to resolve chromatically to the 5th note of the tonic. The leading tone goes up to the tonic, and the 4 goes to the 3. Both those are chromatic and diatonic. Now take the note a half step above the 5. Its the b6. So there's a jumbled explanation sorry if it's confusing."

The accent pattern is this:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.  Often this 3+3+2 pattern might be written in 8/8, but in popular music it's generally just regarded as having one offbeat accent and is in 4/4."

musictheory,3auem6,chrisdunn3,2,Tue Jun 23 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"That kind of motion-iv to vi-is actually pretty common in jazz tunes but it is typically applied in a different contexts with I instead of a vi.   In jazz, this movement isn't really a cadence on it's own but it usually leads into a cadence I(or iii)-VI-ii-V-I. Before I go on, I should mention there are three kinds of chord families (or whatever you want to call them). There are tonic, predominant and dominant functioning chords. In jazz, I, iii and vi are considered to function as tonic chords which allow one to use them interchangeably (that's why I and iii are both accepted in the cadence I wrote above). This is important to know because it'll explain why the iv goes to vi.   The reason iv leads in to I or iii (as I mentioned above) so well because it is basically a plagal cadence (IV to I) but with modal borrowing of the iv from the parallel minor. So it is just a plagal cadence in minor to I instead of i. NOW. In the progression you posted, the iv goes to vi instead, but as I mentioned above vi is tonic functioning like I (so it's kinda like a 'replacement' chord) as well so it checks out as well.   I think that's right.  Listen to All The Things You Are, you'll hear that iv going to iii in the last section of the tune."

I mostly play the violin, so I'll give that as an example. Any piece that's in an ""open"" key-that is, keys of the open strings G, D, A, and E-sounds ""brighter"" to me, probably because the violin itself resonates more freely at the tonics and dominants of these keys. In contrast, a piece in C# minor, for example, will sound darker, warmer, and even dampened on a violin.  This has really interested me in the past because it seems as though many composers (consciously or unconsciously) pick keys very deliberately. For the number of sharps it has, C# minor is very common key, for example. Why not transpose everything down a half step and play it in C minor, or, better yet, up one and play it in D minor? Because instruments produce different timbres in different keys.  Just my unprofessional two cents!"

It's an interesting question.  Maybe the contrast of ""smooth"" as another poster pointed out would help you conceptualize it. ""Smoothness,"" to me anyway, refers to the smoothness of the melodic contour and shape. It especially has to do with music that has a vocal melodic quality to it-- mostly intervals close together sung/played legato creating smooth melodic contour.   So I think you're also right in a way about it having to do with the look of the notes on the page. I think ""angular"" is basically drawing a parallel with the visual/geometric quality. I imagine connecting the dots on the page. Would you get smooth curves or jagged lines?

The first kind you explained—LH chords, RH melody—often results in very close spacing in the LH that sounds muddy and amateurish.   Generally speaking, chords sound better spread over a larger range that better approximates the harmonic series. This image has the first eight notes of the harmonic series stacked on top of each other like a chord. This is the kind of spacing that will sound more pleasing. The lower you are in range, the more space there should be between adjacent notes. Having notes really close together in higher octaves sounds fine, but in lower octaves it just sounds garbled.

It must come from you.   Usually there is not much in changing scales, unless it is required by the chord sequence. It is the timing and choice of the specific notes.   There is limitless creativity in a diatonic progression, if you only stick to the key scale, and it is possible to make beautiful original and creative things with that alone.

musictheory,3ar5ay,timbales,2,Tue Jun 23 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"A great way to get started is to explore using chords with extensions. It might seem confusing at first, but it's a lot easier if you start with familiar chord progressions and convert them to more complex chords.  For example, you could take a I - vi - IV - V7 chord progression:  C - Ami - F - G7   And replace the chords with the respective ninth chords, which would be:  Cmaj9 - Ami9 - Fmaj9 - G9   Really, there are no rules. The coolest sounding chord progressions might not even make that much tonal sense. I recommend listening to a lot of neo-soul recordings and piano tutorial videos. Check out Robert Glasper!

musictheory,3as32w,motinis,3,Tue Jun 23 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"Smoothness is usually a result of two things: 1) linearity--that is, moving to adjacent scale degrees, using half or whole steps; 2) expectation--when notes resolves where we expect them to.  So, yes, using the leading note to resolve up to the tonic (7-1) can help.  But, you can also use the supertonic to resolve down to the tonic (2-1), and that sounds good too.  And, if your first note isn't on the tonic, you may not want to use the leading tone or subtonic at all. Suppose your first note is scale degree 5 (the dominant), then you may want to precede it by scale degree 4 (subdominant) or 6 (submediant).  Other options that break from stepwise, linear movement are movement by descending fifth or ascending fourth, as mentioned elsewhere in this thread: going from the dominant to the tonic feels pretty smooth, even though it's a large leap. This may not apply if your first note isn't the tonic but you're playing a tonic chord there, though; then it gets trickier to generalize about.  Note that this may also depends to a certain extent on the notes that come BEFORE that last note, too: like, a falling 3-2-1 melody will probably sound smoother than, say, 6-2-1, even though both have stepwise movement to the tonic."

musictheory,3as32w,nowayman12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"ending on the dominant can actually be very strong (V-I cadence), and opens up cool possibilities for exiting the loop."

musictheory,3aphnr,Kopachris,10,Mon Jun 22 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"They're grace notes.  Depending on the situation they can imply a variety of things rhythmically, but in most cases (including this one) they just sort of wedge in there, faster than the surrounding notes."
musictheory,3aphnr,maestro2005,8,Mon Jun 22 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"The actual notation itself is known as a grace note (or in this case, notes).  Whether it's an appoggiatura or accacciatura depends largely upon performance practice and style. An appoggiatura usually has no slash through the grace note (like in the example) and they are intended to be performed in time. Whether the appoggiatura is perfomed on or before the beat largely depends on the composer and typical practices for that composer.   An accacciatura usually has a slash through the note, and is intended to be performed as rapidly as possible just prior to the note's beginning.   What you have here is an appoggiatura, and should be performed as though the smaller notes were a part of the larger structure, with the first note of the triplet being the note that loses its time so that the little notes can be fit into the last triplet.   Listen to how the aria is sung and you'll get an idea of what I mean (since we don't have a notation plug in on Reddit :) ).  Hope this helps."

The two notes can be called many things, but most people will identify  them as graces notes.  This is sufficient enough.  But these graces notes belong to a bigger group of tones whose purpose are to embellish or ornament the primary tone.  Thus, they called ornaments or embellishments."

musictheory,3aphnr,Malkaveer,3,Tue Jun 23 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"I would say these that these particular grace notes are appoggiatura, since they don't have a line through them.  They borrow time from the second note. My preferred way of interpreting would be on eighth note, an inception-like triplet sixteenth notes within a triplet (this would turn the middle eighth note into the last sixteenth triplet) and then the last eighth note."

musictheory,3aphnr,Dolphins13718,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"The use of the slash is often just a convention that was added by editors to be a bit more specific. In the Baroque era they didn't use the slash and it was up to the performer to understand what to play. I know that often it is used to differentiate between the two nowadays but it would be important to know the editor and how strictly they try and respect historical traditions. And after that, if it's musically convincing, you can perform it how you want."

The other notes you hear are embellishments which you can think of as leading tones in the classical sense, but none of them change the tonality. When his left hand moves on the neck, strings 2-4 are open, continuing the G chord. The vocal, dare I say, the lyric, is the most important thing in this kind of music, so his guitar embellishments keep the background music from becoming boring without interfering with his voice."

The ending phrase chord (""...for yourself) is the most interesting one, as it could be a I chord with a 6 in it, but I hear it more as a vi chord.  I can see where you would hear a G chord throughout due to the bass line, but I'd just call that a pedal point. Just my two cents!"
musictheory,3arbtd,m-and-m,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:26:55 2015 UTC,"The other reason why I don't hear any of the moves as chord changes is because suggesting that he moves to IV or even to ii or iii also implies that you should get a world-flipping feeling of the subdominant opposing the tonic, which I don't get from this at all. You could substitute in a IV chord on that line and it would work, though- and to me, would make the song sound more like Gospel.  It's ""just"" Delta Blues."

musictheory,3aoye9,dylanthepiguy2,11,Mon Jun 22 09:00:54 2015 UTC,"Writing Bach chorales is a pretty tough thing to do, if you haven't had lessons in harmony and counterpoint I'd start with something simpler first. Having said that, this is how I'd write a Bach chorale:   Write the soprano melody first, analyse the poem in terms of stressed and unstressed syllables, and in gerneral, place stressed syllables on strong beats. The melody should be written in mostly crotchets with some minims, and the last note of each phrase may be longer. Include a mixture of step wise motion and leaps; large leaps, of a 4th or more, should be used sparingly and followed by step-wise motion in the opposite direction. (This rule does not apply to the last note of a phrase and the first note of the next.) Make sure leading notes rise, and avoid augmented and diminished intervals in the melody, unless you deliberately want a particularly poignant word in the poem to stand out. Write the Bass line next, following two-part counterpoint rules; the parts should mostly be in contrary or oblique motion, short runs of parallel 3rds and 6ths are good, but AVOID PARALLEL 5THS and OCTAVES. The melody should follow the same guidelines as the soprano melody, except the bass line can move by leaps more, and does not have to recover from leaps by stepwise motion. Downward diminished leaps are allowed, but they must resolve upwards. The part should outline cadential progressions at the end of phrases. Once you have the soprano and bass lines, you should go through your piece and identify which chords you would like to use for each beat. A chord chart might help, and you probably have an idea of the sound you'd like anyway while writing the melody and bass line, but change these if you fancy a particular chord which does not include the melody and bass notes. Try to include at least one diminished 7th and a few dominant 7ths, a mixture of root-position and first-inversion chords, and you may like to include a Neapolitan 6th chord. Start at the end of each phrase with the cadential progression, and work backwards. Now for the tough bit, fill in the tenor and alto parts using the chord progression you have devised, following the rules of the melody line, avoiding parallels 5ths, octaves, diminished and augmented intervals, and making sure leading notes rise. The inner parts can briefly cross if necessary to avoid any of these. Remember, the Alto and Tenor parts must be sung, so make them as musical as the Soprano line! In general, keep the tenor part high, they can go as high as A or B flat, but don't keep them there too long! Avoid gaps between the upper three parts of an octave or more, but the tenor and bass parts can be separated by more than an octave. Once you have done this and checked for mistakes, you should go through and add suspensions, passing notes, auxiliaries, etc., making sure none of these incur parallels, and always prepare and resolve suspensions. Doing this while actually writing the melody lines makes things unnecessarily complicated, and increases the chance of making mistakes, by all means, make a note of any you would like to include when writing the parts, but don't write them until the very end.   If you have any questions, or would like me to have a look at what you've done, just reply. :)"

musictheory,3aoye9,Telope,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"No problem, it's difficult to gauge the level of understanding people have on here! Sorry if what I said came across as patronising. :(  You edited your original post with a question; my best guess is that this chord, G minor 7th, contains the notes B flat, D, and F, as well as the root G, and that is what you are hearing that makes it sound major.  As a little extra, (I've just thought of this,) in the Dorian mode, 7ths built on the tonic and dominant, (the two most important scale degrees,) are minor 7ths, which have both major and minor triads, and so sound (what I call) 'tonally neutral.' I think it's no coincidence that the Dorian mode is in the middle ground of the modes in terms of 'brightness' with the Locrian mode (flattened 5th) being the darkest and the Lydian mode (augmented 4th) being the brightest."
musictheory,3aoye9,ckaili,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:00:29 2015 UTC,"That's fine, you didn't seem patronising but it does looks like you spent ages of time typing it out...  And interestingly it sounds 'tonality neutral' like you said when I play it you itself but playing the recording it sounds very major. Maybe that's because the major second in S/A voices play an important role, and helps make it sound like a suspension but with all voices expect the soprano resolving to Cmajor"
musictheory,3aoye9,Bromskloss,2,Tue Jun 23 03:08:16 2015 UTC,"I've never composed a chorale myself, but I've played through a lot of Bach's chorales as practice on piano and have sung in them as well.  Some more stylistic things I notice about them, in addition to what you and Telope have said:   Bach likes to change tonal centers several times over the course of a chorale.  As far as melody, this usually presents itself as a chromatic tone acting as a leading tone to another key (e.g. introducing #4 in the melody as a leading tone to a V chord).  I don't remember specifically if he uses other chromatic preparations (like augmented 6th chords).   Don't feel the need to have all 4 voices singing at once the whole time.  Allow yourself to make use of voice entrances and absences to outline phrases, and pay attention to how each voice part sounds by itself. Bach also creates momentum after phrase-ends by inverting the previously held chord.  For example, if a phrase ends on a I chord, the start of the next phrase might be on a I6, which might propel the bass melody to a following IV chord. Bach makes particularly good use of suspensions and deceptive cadences (in my opinion) in minor keys.  Suspensions sometimes cascade into a sequence. I can't give you specifics at the moment, but one qualitative thing about Bach chorales I've noticed is that the phrases are not strictly even in terms of length, i.e. they aren't necessarily 4 or 8 bars long.  They just sort of follow the words unapologetically.  Of course, with Bach, everything's a feature, never a bug, but it's something I always felt stood out."

With a rondo, there is a returning A section, interspersed with other music. With your form, because the A section is heard most often (since it is repeated with each iteration), I hear the A section as the returning section. Then the rondo B is your B section, the rondo C is your BC section, the rondo D is your BCD section, etc.  This is probably not a good thing that it is heard this way. Your form lacks one of the rondo's key elements: the element of drama. The interspersed music (B, C, D) is what enlivens the rondo form, surprising us with what will happen next, while the A section keeps us grounded. But because of the repetitive nature of your form, having to repeat all the music heard before, we already know most of what's going to happen in these sections. For example, when we get to the part where it goes BCDE, we've already heard 75% of the music that's going to happen. This will only get worse as the piece gets longer.  You'll have long passages of already heard music, organized in a predictable way, with your audience just waiting the hear the new thing, or worse, losing interest altogether.  There are a couple things you could do. You could add variations as sections return. If you expanded your orchestration, you change up your arrangement as well. You could insert some sort of tonal scheme, which you've already got some insight to. I think the last choice is your best bet, because you could conceivably break the perception of a rondo form that way. You could see in the literature how rondo tonal schemes work, and then consciously do the opposite. Or, you could just lean into the rondo-ness of it and then see what can be done there.  I like the idea of the form, it's an interesting intellectual challenge. It could be called an ""iterated"" form, or an ""iterated rondo"". But it'll be tough to work with. Good luck to you."

This seems to be a somewhat different context though, you seem to be approaching it from a western art music perspective. I tried a bit of that, but not much. I didn't like it because it seemed that it took a very long time before you would remember and recognize later themes because the longer the wait between them the less you remember them if that makes sense, and then between all that there was a bit too much repetition of the earlier sections that it got boring. I might prefer some variant thereof, like what codyloydl suggested, or perhaps just take a section to introduce the new theme between each time, like iA, iB AB, iC ABC, iD ABCD where i is an introduction to a new theme.

musictheory,3akphm,K_Rayfish,2,Mon Jun 22 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"In traditional classical harmony, chords in minor key were written as i iidim III iv etc. This was because it was assumed that ""III"" would be interpreted as ""bIII"" because the 3rd scale degree is always minor in minor keys. This works okay, but as harmony became more chromatic, non-diatonic chords became more common. I personally prefer the i iidim bIII iv v/V bVI bVII approach because it is totally unambiguous as to what chords are meant to be played."
musictheory,3akphm,wheres_the_form,2,Mon Jun 22 14:35:04 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way. Each chord is constructed diatonically, that is with notes that are in the key. If I'm in d minor, I use these: D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C. Now, each chord is constructed starting with one of these seven as a root and adding two other diatonic notes, specifically the one a third above and the one a fifth above. So, here's what we've got.  D F A - i E G Bb - iidim F A C - III G Bb D - iv A C E - v Bb D F - VI C E G - VII  HOWEVER  In most cases, you will see C# instead of C. The reason is a discussion for a different post, but the short answer is that it is necessary for functional harmony; for effectively driving the music forward.  Usually this C# is applied to the v and VII, but not the III, giving us V (A C# E) and viidim (C# E G)."

However, in practice there is only one interval ratio that is free to be specified arbitrarily, because the other fixed interval is always t(P8) = 2, otherwise octaves aren’t pure!    If we don't care too much about any other interval being exactly pure, why don't we want to consider tempering the octave too? For example to compensate for the inharmonicity of pianos or gongs, or to round out an excessively precise synth timbre. To fuel xenharmonic explorations, we might even decide not to use the octave as one of our basis intervals.   This gives rise to the main problem: two non-octave intervals can’t be simultaneously pure.   I think this is specifically in reference to the scale you give below, but the way it's stated, I disagree. ""Pure"" isn't a strictly defined term and I wouldn't find it odd to see it applied to some of the more remote intervals of the Pythagorean scale. And anyway, two is too small number, since in Pythagorean tuning 9/8, 4/3, 3/2, and 16/9 all appear, and these are well within anyone's definition of purity.   the Fundamental Keyboard Problem   I like this phrase."

musictheory,3afcon,Phayke,100,Fri Jun 19 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"There's a really important concept at play here: music is based off scales. For simplicity's sake, let's just think about the major scale.   There's a rule we've come up with for writing major scales: you must use each letter name exactly once in your scale. You can't have a major scale with 2 D's in it (Even if one is D and the other is D#). There's a good reason for this. When we write music on the page, each letter is a line or a space, so a scale uses each line and space in order. It doesn't skip over any of them, and doesn't use the same line or space twice. It look like a scale. This is good.   Now, just accept this rule for a moment. And let's imagine a major scale in a world without the flat symbol. In this world, they only know about sharps. And let's not just  pick any major scale, let's work through F Major.  Alright, starts on F. Easy enough. Now we've got G, then A. Okay, what's the next note? Well in our universe we know it's Bb, but in this world, they'd have to call it A#. So that means the scale would be:  F G A A# C D E F  There's two notes on the line for ""A"" and none on the line for B. It looks weird, and is hard to sight read. It's unintuitive.  Even worse, there's no way to use a key signature for this version of the F major scale. You can't put a sharp on the line for ""A"" because A-natural is also a part of the scale. You'd have to use accidentals the whole time. Key signatures are good. They tell the performer which scale is the foundation for that song. They de-clutter the page by removing a lot of unneeded accidentals, and they make scales look like scales.  This line of reasoning: that scales should behave like scales, is an important idea for theory. And it means that we need both sharps and flats to make everything work. Some starting notes need notes to be raised to fit the major scale pattern, and some starting notes need the notes to be lowered to fit the major scale pattern, so we need both symbols."
musictheory,3afcon,BRNZ42,3,Fri Jun 19 22:15:24 2015 UTC,"Great answer.  I had wondered the same thing.  I guess because I don't read musical notation, that obvious answer had never occurred to me."
musictheory,3afcon,RickenAxer,10,Sat Jun 20 10:23:30 2015 UTC,This is by far the best answer.
musictheory,3afcon,remydc,24,Fri Jun 19 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"Diatonic intervals (E - F) and chromatic intervals (E - Eb) are two different things because of their function, even if the sound is the same. Music notation exists to represent something that can't be seen. If you were to hear both scenarios within a composition, you'd hear the difference."
musictheory,3afcon,OrlandoSlav,27,Fri Jun 19 18:36:34 2015 UTC,"Right. Note spellings are primarily important because of what they say about voice leading and function. In a truly atonal scenario (e.g., 12-tone serialism), most composers do opt to use all of the same type of accidental (usually sharps in my experience), because function and voice leading are not important to the harmonic and melodic language.   But when you're trying to show that a note functions as a leading tone, convention dictates that we use A# -> B, not Bb -> B, even though they sound the same in equal temperament. Same goes when you have a chromatic upper neighbor like in V7 chords - the 7th resolves down, so you'd never spell C7 with an A# because it is resolving to the A.   Plus there are pragmatic reasons like minimizing the number of accidentals on the page. If you use Bb and B natural all over the place in the same measure, you have to keep adding flats and natural signs. If you use A# instead, you don't need to use a natural sign for the B natural."
musictheory,3afcon,keakealani,10,Fri Jun 19 18:45:33 2015 UTC,"I think we also need to remember that, within the conventions of our tradition, Western music is heavily immersed in the use of diatonic structures (keys). You're right that voice leading principles also exist for highlighting leading tones and such, but that's just part of the picture.   We have a diatonic system of keys from our tradition of tonal music that tells performers (and experienced listeners) to expect a specific series of pitches from a given series of sonorities (i.e. a chord progression). That system has been refined over the years to be encapsulated by seven letters, specifically ABCDEFG, assigned to specific pitches with five more pitches occurring ""in between"" these letters.   And any diatonic system (say, the major scale) is transferrable across all the pitches, so when we take the WWHWWWH structure of the major scale and construct the C Major scale (CDEFGABC), we can transfer this structure to the pitch of E (EF#G#ABC#D#E) or the pitch of Eb (EbFGAbBbCDEb) and keep the notation consistent (step-wise locations of pitches on the staff, without doubling pitches on lines and spaces or incorporating ""special accidental scenarios"" for one scale or another). This is what allows us to use key signatures as a short-hand method for constructing these structures.   So, to answer the OP's question, it's really more about convention and tradition. We use sharps in scales where the diatonic structure requires them (like the E Major scale referenced above, which doesn't use flats because... EGbAbABDbEbE skips the F pitch, doubles the Ab and A, and also doubles the Eb and E). We use EF#G#ABC#D#E because it's the least redundant representation of all pitches of the E Major scale on the music staff.   That's why, within the limits of Major and Natural Minor scales, we have ""Sharp"" scales and ""Flat"" scales, hence why we will typically use sharps in situations where our key represents a sharp scale and flats in situations where our key represents a flat scale. And there are also scales where it's advantageous to use flats instead of sharps (like Db major with 5 flats instead of C# major's 7 sharps, or B major's 5 sharps instead of Cb major's 7 flats).   We particularly enjoy this simplification when it reduces our accidental count to its absolute minimum. Take the case of G# Major, for example. Here, we get G#A#B#C#D#E#FxG# (that's, F Double-Sharp). Changing G# Major to Ab Major gives us AbBbCDbEbFGAb, which is four flats (with Ab repeated, so we don't count it) instead of 6 sharps plus a double sharp. Our use of sharps in a circumstance like this would make absolutely no sense with the option of using flats instead. Notation is much easier, as is publishing (publishers like using less ink whenever it's practical, and sometimes when it's not).   I realize you hinted at this in the end of your response with ""Plus there are pragmatic reasons..."" but I believe that there's a strong convention behind our notation system that's more elaborate than merely being pragmatic. Wouldn't you agree, maybe?"

Conventions usually pop up because they are clearer, less messy, convey more information, etc. Then, as conventions become more widespread we start ascribing additional information because it can be inferred from the way people write things. In turn, this brings about more conventions and standards, which we begin to call ""theory"" and we keep honing and finessing it to apply to different situations that aren't covered by the original convention. I think all of it basically revolves around a combination of tradition and practicality, and I'm definitely not here to debate the exact proportions thereof :)"

I'm sure there are instruments that are less bound by that fact, and therefore might have other opinions, but it's how I always conceive of music, so at least it should be helpful for others that think like I do."

musictheory,3afcon,Mr-Yellow,5,Fri Jun 19 18:37:24 2015 UTC,"In a diatonic scale, you use each note's letter name once.  For example, in a C major scale you'll use C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C.  Two other Major key examples:  Ab:  Ab-Bb-C-Db-Eb-F-G-Ab  E: E-F#-G#-A-B-C#-D#-E  The bolded notes equate to each other enharmonically, and use the same key on the piano, but are located at different places within their respective scales.  To keep the pattern going, some notes would be raised twice (a double sharp) to maintain the name of the scale degree.  This also makes it much easier as a player to be able to quickly see where a note lays in the scale.  If we're coasting along in the key of E and I see an Ab in the part, I don't expect to be playing the third in an E chord, but instead would expect to be playing an element in a borrowed chord."

musictheory,3afcon,shitterbug,5,Fri Jun 19 18:32:12 2015 UTC,"Flats and sharps used to refer to different pitches before equal temperament. One of the things equal temperament did was to consolidate the slight variances in intervals that existed in different keys, thus making B# and C the same pitch instead of two slightly different pitches.  In modern times, accidentals and enharmonic equivalents exist for stylistic, functional, and theoretical reasons. Fb-Ab-Cb is technically just an E major, but in a certain context it shouldn't be spelled as such."
musictheory,3afcon,ChuckEye,3,Fri Jun 19 22:16:57 2015 UTC,Aren't for example Ab and G# still different pitches on fretless instruments like the violin?

musictheory,3afcon,xiipaoc,3,Fri Jun 19 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially when playing in period ensembles or when bowed strings play without instruments whose tunings are fixed (e.g. Piano)."
musictheory,3afcon,hilarymeggin,2,Sat Jun 20 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"No, that's a misconception.  If you're varying your pitch from equal temperament -- which you can't do on the piano but can do on most other instruments -- you can vary an Ab and a G# differently.  You don't have to and you don't always want to, and a well-trained musician will know specifically when and how to do it.  And you can also vary the same note differently in different contexts, too.  You might play the D in a G major chord differently from the D in Bb major chord.  So it's wrong to say that Ab and G# are different pitches.  They're the same base pitch, but the musician might (or not) vary them differently."

musictheory,3afcon,xiipaoc,2,Sat Jun 20 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's also a composition thing. If you're wanting some notes to go up, it would look nicer and get your point across if you wrote A-Bb-C instead of A-A#-C"

The player will be focused on the B because of the key, and that missing B will be quite prominent, as well as the diminished third between the A# and C."
musictheory,3afcon,Mr-Yellow,2,Sat Jun 20 13:32:52 2015 UTC,"No one has mentioned what I thought was the most obvious thing: accidentals. We need symbols that indicate when a pitch should be raised or lowered, in practical application. Even putting aside the (very important) compositional considerations of the function of A# vs. Bb, sometimes it just makes more sense, when you're playing, to raise the next pitch in a scale rather than skip to the next one and lower it. Maybe it's a function of training, but there are times when A# feels more natural to play, and seeing Bb would be jarring and confusing."

Note the numbers of sharps or flats is a predictable mathematical relationship, and they are added in an unchanging order with the 1st sharp being available in key with 2 sharps, the 2nd being in the key with 3 etc."
musictheory,3afcon,and_It_Swam,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:35:40 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're writing a song in B flat major but you don't have flats, you'd have to write the scale/key with double-sharps instead. Similarly, if you got rid of all sharps but wanted to write in the key of A major, you'd have to use double-flats to notate certain notes.  Plus, sharps and flats aren't necessarily the same thing. A sharp note is taking a note and raising it by a half step. A flat lowers a note by a half step. Thus, having Ab and A#, they aren't the same notes, so it isn't exactly interchangeable."
musictheory,3aei1e,helixkirby,21,Fri Jun 19 13:49:43 2015 UTC,"Usually how you spell out a chord is by thirds. That's how the chord gets it's name. All those chords are C major, G major, A minor, and F major. There is no 'right' way really but rather what you think sounds good to you.    What you're asking about as far as spelling out a chord, I think you're after what an inversion is. An Inversion is the same chord with a different note in the bass other than the root note.    In that second example (ceg, bdg, ace, acf) The C chord is in root position because the C note is in the bass, That G chord is in first inversion because the 3rd of the chord is in the bass. That A minor is in root position because the A is in the bass. That F is in first inversion because A (The 3rd of F major) is in the bass.    That dgb and eac chords in the second example are in second inversion meaning the 5th of that chord is the lowest note.    Overall, each chord inversion has it's functions. You can learn about them in any theory class, but in any case, it's mostly a personal preference thing."
musictheory,3aei1e,Chuber120,8,Fri Jun 19 14:12:23 2015 UTC,You want to look at the way the notes lead into one another horizontally. Read up on voice leading.
musictheory,3aei1e,saxartist,3,Fri Jun 19 14:15:38 2015 UTC,"The first way is the most correct way. Have you ever heard of figured bass? It's basically the shorthand way for Roman Numerals to say ""this chord degree is in the bass part."" After the bass note, it is up to the player to determine the order of the top notes.   So your progression I V vi IV would generally be understood in traditional harmony to be CEG (or CGE perhaps) GBD (GDB) , etc. That's ignoring the fact that you'd probably be hanged for using that ""progression"" back in the day. But that's a different story.  If you wanted to have a bass line that stays in place a bit, it could look like this (bear with me here, I'm on my phone. The Arabic numbers should be superscripts stacked on top of each other.):  I V6/4 vi3 IV6/4  That translates (in C major) to CEG, DGB, CEA, CFA. The I has no inversion symbol, so root position is implied. The 3 means a chord is in first inversion, and the 6/4 means.... yep, second inversion.  That being said, in popular music, if you wanted to do the same thing, you could write out lead sheet symbols. This way is much simpler: write the chord and the bass note together as a fraction. The chord goes in the numerator, and the bass note goes in the denominator. The same progression that I did above:  C G/D Am/C F/C  Tl;dr: it depends on your usage, but I V vi IV usually implies everything in root position. And the way you spell chords in root position is in order of thirds from root going to fifth.   P.S. I made a frowny face before the figured bass example and now I need to even it out :)"
musictheory,3aei1e,billychuck,2,Fri Jun 19 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be however it is played in the song.  Root inversion (c e g) is the safe bet, and the easiest to make sense of when looking at quickly.  It would make more sense to just write ""C"", as that implies c-e-g.  If it is played in first inversion (e g c), I'd write C/E , if played in second inversion (g c e), I'd write C/G.  I hope this helps."
musictheory,3aei1e,axisofelvis,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:16:53 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what everyone else is saying, the note you have to worry the most about is the bass note, for that denotes the inversion. Above that, however, it's pretty much free game. So you could have C-e-g-c-e-g from the bottom up, or C-g-e-g-c-e, and so on, and it's still a C chord in root position (or your I chord).   Which version you happen to choose is purely contextual. Certain combinations will sound better given what comes before it, because of the rules of counterpoint. There are entire college classes on counterpoint; to sum it up in a reddit comment would be pretty daunting.   However, in the modern era, classic counterpoint is sort of null. Pretty much every rock song ever completely ignores it, and we still seem to like it."
musictheory,3aei1e,Scal3s,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"Coming more from a jazz perspective, the relevant term would be voicing, assuming I'm understanding the question.   Generally, that becomes a personal preference thing and a way that piano players and arrangers develop their individual voices. If you have a chord progression like the one in your example, I generally would advise against jumping around and doing everything in root position, though your bass note can do so quite happily."

musictheory,3aei1e,I_love_hiromi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:27:37 2015 UTC,"When it comes to voice-leading, it's up to you.  Usually what's most important in how a chord is spelled out is what you want in the higher and lower voices, but if someone is already playing the bass notes, that frees you up even more.  It's like playing piano with only the right hand.  Apart from the soprano/bass notes, another thing that's important are regarding voice-leading rules such as avoidance of parallel 5ths and striving for contrary motions) but if you don't know about these, just forget about it and let your ear guide you.  In any case, breaking rules is often encouraged in creating great music.   Finally, if your bass note does matter (ie someone else isn't already taking care of it for you), just make sure it will sound good on its own as a bass line and let the other voices take care of the notes it is not.   When it comes to Roman Numerals, there are specific symbols that denote what the bass is playing.  For example, in the key of C, if you're playing an F chord with the bass playing a C note, it should be written as a IV64.    Here is a table of inversions for triad chords:  I = bass plays Root (eg: from lower to higher voices: C E G) I6 = bass plays 3rd (eg: from lower to higher voices: E G C or E C G) I64 = bass plays 5th  (eg: from lower to higher voices: G E C or G C E)  Here's a full chord progression example:  I I6 IV iv64 bVII I (try playing this in 4-4 with each chord being 2 beats except the iv64 & bVII -- give them 1 beat each)  spelled out from lower to higher voices with 4 voices for each chord:  CEGC, EEGC, FFAC, CFAbC, BbFBbD, CEGC  Keep in mind Roman Numerals are mostly for didactic purposes; in the real world, musicians typically prefer chord symbols.   The above example in chord symbols:  C C/E F Fmin/C Bb C  When you see a slash-chord, that just tells you what the bass is playing."

In short, you have a hell of a nice core to work from.  Ok, now the criticisms (all from a good place :) ):  Overall criticisms:     Not enough fretboard graphics.  If this is guitar-centric you need more fretboard.  The piano comparisons are good, keep those. The organization and rhythm of the text is off within the sections.  The material is very structured but the explanatory text is a bit all over the place.  A couple of small additions I think could go a long way.  You should describe and explain Standard Tuning early, for example, since so much of the rest of the text depends so heavily on it.  You should also explain why the intervals are shown in the order they are since it is not obvious to a beginner.  A brief mention of chord theory (foreshadowing presumed future posts) and how, especially, Root, thirds and fifths fit in would be appropriate.   Specifics:   You need an intro paragraph.  Summarize what you are going to cover and a brief explanation of why. Instead of concentrating on 'C' on the reference guide, call it 'Root'.  Explain what Root means and keep C as root but generalize the reference. In the 'Octave' section in the part where you say C goes to C, it is a good place to mention what the difference is, too.  C2 and C3 and what that means when it comes to frequency maybe.  As a reader I found myself asking 'what's the difference?' which is left unresolved.  Explain the difference with the B string in standard tuning earlier and more clearly.  It deserves a free standing explanation when it comes to beginners. When you go into inversions in the 'Fifths' section it is a little confusing.  I think it is an interesting topic but it probably deserves its own explanatory paragraph, especially since the organization of the rest of the post depends on it.  I also didn't know you you meant by the sentence 'This is the reason for them sounding much alike.'  What does 'them' refer to, specifically?  The relative difference in tones and the root?  The tones individually?  It could use some clarification.  Also 'If you play the same notes, but the low one on top and the high one underneath, you always get the inversion.'  On top of and underneath what? the reader will wonder.   Anyway, I hope that helps.  It is a post that will be very helpful to a lot of people as is.  With a few changes I think it can become a post that people come back to again and again.  Thanks for taking the time to put this resource together!"

I think the paragraphs about the letter note names, the C major scale, and the sharps and flats should have been in the first post, just after ""what is a scale?"", instead of the second. That way, people won't get confused when you talk about a G major scale and nothing about G.   Other than that, you do a pretty good job explaining! I would take out the references to Ionian mode. It will just confuse people. Save it until you talk about modes. I would also call fourths and fifths ""perfect fourths"" and ""perfect fifths"" (fourths and fifths for short). This is because of this potential argument:   Some Guy: Blah Blah Blah perfect fourth  Subscriber: you mean fourth?  Some Guy: perfect fourth!  Subscriber: fourth! JUST fourth!  Some Guy: mother F sharping PERFECT fourth!   Although in reality, it would probably go like this:   Some Guy: Blah Blah Blah perfect fourth  Subscriber: you mean fourth?  Some Guy: Yes.    So, that's pretty much it! Understandably, you didn't talk about logarithmic frequency representation of notes, but you can save that until episode 27.5*246/12  Also, I checked out the app. Do you develop it? Am impressed.

For example, in this case, I perceive the melody as:  1 2 b3 2 2  relative to the key of C major, it is:  1 2 4 5 4  Using my method, it's hard for me to understand that I am playing in Major C.

musictheory,3adxwo,Flufflecorns,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"I don't know that there are any foolproof methods. A lot of songs have a melody that repeats, but it's made interesting because the chords are changing, so the notes in the melody take on different harmonic roles each time. Examples: the choruses from ""Unwritten"" and ""Happy"" have super boring 2 and 3 note melodies if you strip away the chords."
musictheory,3adxwo,Flufflecorns,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:06:15 2015 UTC,"I usually analyze intervals according to the chord in the progression they are being played over, because that's ultimately what gives them their tonal quality. The same note might make a chord sound happy or sad depending on the key and exactly which chord it's played over."
musictheory,3adxwo,Flufflecorns,2,Fri Jun 19 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"This seems like a reasonable method. Would you mind helping me figure it out?  Let's take the verse from Neil Young's ""Heart of Gold"" as an example, which has an  Em C D G  progression. Respective to those chords, the C note is:  Em chord -> C is 6th degree  C chord -> C is 1st degree  D chord -> C is diminished 7th (?) degree  G chord -> C is 4th degree  Would that be right?"
musictheory,3adxwo,Flufflecorns,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on what the melody is, so yes, if the C is constant across all the chords.  For example, take Earth Angel. Standard G, Em, C, D (I vi IV V progression), which has a G D B C D B A melody (not taking account for rhythm, those are the notes). Instead of looking at the notes from the root, I look at them from the chord, or, more accurately, I analyze how they interact with the chord and affect its tonality. So the first G and D go over the G chord, from which G is the root and D is the fifth, so together they build a standard triad. Then the B goes over an Em, also the fifth, further lending itself to a standard triad. The C goes with a C, and the D goes on the last beat of the C, foreshadowing the transition to the D in the next measure, before dropping to B and A over the D chord, the D acting as a passing tone to the fifth, A, which also builds a standard triad.  The melody plays with the chords under it, so it's important to understand how the chords influence the structure of the melody, and it's also important to understand how every note functions in context. As you see, all of the major notes in the melody are fifths or roots, emphasizing the harmony of the chord. The other notes act as passing tones to those key points of harmony. Where this differs from, say, a metal song, is that a metal musician might emphasize dissonance over harmony, using intervals like seconds and sixths of the chord (or especially major sevenths, which are super ugly since they're only a half step away from the root) and using harmonious intervals as passing tones instead - or omitting them entirely.  EDIT: Just realized I gave an extremely convoluted confirmation of your reasoning; I misread your comment at first and thought it needed explaining. I am terribly sorry. Will be leaving the word soup above for posterity."

Bands called ""progressive"" like Dream Theater don't hold a candle to Megadeth at its best, and what blows my mind even more is that I heard Mustaine say he can't name a single scale. That guy is a full-fledged music genius (or at least he used to be before he turned into a conservative born-again Christian).  As for Slayer, I think Kerry King is insanely underrated. On /r/guitar I see a lot of people say he's a wanker who shreds randomly but all he plays makes total sense to me, unlike other chromatic shredders (like some ""prog metal"" guys).  A little OT question since you know your metal: what key do you think the song ""Black metal"" by Venom is? I hear it in A major but it's rare for metal and I think I might be mistaken."

Anyway, I can't honestly hear it very well, which I guess is kind of part of the appeal, really, but it sounds to me like it's just classic upbeat metal. Probably in a minor key emphasizing four and five like a lot of upbeat metal.  And as for chromaticism, the real trick is to use scales with built in chromatic runs like the double harmonic or to modulate between minor, phrygian, and locrian, essentially just flatting/sharpening fifths and seconds and sevenths as needed. I think the real key is knowing which intervals can be messed with before it starts to just sound gross."

Marty was great, and was definitely was a big influence, and he surely contributed the melodic stuff in golden era Megadeth. If you hear his stuff with Jason Becker (absolutely amazing musician, still makes music despite being paralysed) in Cacophony and his later solo stuff, he is a lot more restrained in his playing...Mustaine's weird riffs mixed with Friedman's masterful leads created something unique.  I don't like any of the albums after Friedman, to be honest. Chris Broderick I hate...I know that on a technical level, he's as good as a metal guitarist can be, but I always perceived him as a session musician rather than part of the band. Now that he also left and Kiko Loureiro joined, things will be more interesting. His stuff in Angra was really great and he's a very good player...and it's not like Megadeth can get any worse! I mean, they don't totally suck but Chris Broderick was the worst possible fit for a band like Megadeth.  You know, at this point, I would rather see Megadeth disband and Mustaine take some years off. Bruce Dickinson did and when he came back he was better than ever.  The same goes for Michael Amott and Arch Enemy. It used to be a great band, but now they are trite and they are wasting an underrated vocalist (Alissa White-Gluz) and a great songwriter (Jeff Loomis) to play shitty pop-metal (War Eternal). Those musicians would all do better elsewhere."

It may be that Thirteen came out early in my development and my brother bought it and listened to it constantly. That kind of thing can make you overlook a lot. Megadeth has never matched Rust in Piece, in my opinion, but their poppier stuff with Marty afterward was alright. I liked Youthanasia. I think there are a lot of classic bands that need to give up the ghost at this point, because they're just stealing attention from up-and-coming talent and their influence has already come and gone. Nobody talks about how great Death Magnetic or Super Collider were, and nobody ever will (even though I was a fan of the latter, Sound Wars or no; it was actually my first metal album).

Both the V and the IV chord naturally progress very strongly to I, so we are used to hearing a I chord following them. In the case of the IV chord, I can either happen immediately afterwards (plagal cadence) or in the progression IV-V-I (authentic cadence). Technically half cadences are only a V that doesn't resolve to I, but because IV tends so strongly to I, it has the same effect.  TL;DR: IV tends to progress to I just like V does, so it creates a similar unresolved sound when it does not."

musictheory,3acbnl,eddrix,22,Fri Jun 19 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"The chords are fine but the Roman numeral analysis kind of sucks, unsurprisingly since it's moving through two modulations.  The verse is in one key, D major. The chorus is in another, F major. These aren't closely related keys—they have three notes different between them, so when you modulate between them, it can sound quite jarring.  The modulations are smoothed out a bit by what's called pivot chords or common chords between the two keys. The common chord functions in both keys.  At the end of the verse when you hear Em–A under ""for the good of all of us"", that's a normal ii-V progression, but instead of resolving to I (D), it resolves deceptively to B♭ major on ""Except the ones who are dead"", which functions as a ♭VI looking backward to the verses's key.  So it's sort of doubly shocking because 1) it's a deceptive resolution of the V chord and 2) it's a chromatic chord. But looking forward to the chorus's key, the B♭ functions as a IV chord in the new key of F major.   Something similar happens at the end of the chorus. The chorus uses I, IV, and V chords mostly in the key of F major. But in the last IV chord of the chorus under ""for the people who..."", instead of going to V or I or whatever it normally would, the IV chord functions as the pivot chord between the two keys. So B♭ is IV in the chorus's key of F minor, but functions in the verse's key of D major as ♭VI still, and moves to the V chord of the new verse key.  tl;dr: B♭ major functions in both D major (through borrowing from the parallel minor) and F major and this chord is used as a portal (ha! Oh man, maybe I should use that in modulation lessons in the future...) between the two keys."

musictheory,3acbnl,japko,4,Mon Jun 22 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"If these chords are to be trusted (they seem to, but I haven't checked myself), this is how I would make sense of it:  The key in the verse is D major, in the chorus it is F major. The modulation from F to D (and why it seems to lack a resolution) might be explained thus:  The chords are Bb-A-D, and the harmony very strongly suggests a cadence on d minor, the relative minor of the tonic, F major. This bVI-V-i motion is very common. One example of it being used is ""Good Vibrations"" by the Beach Boys (Dm-C-Bb-A), and another is ""Hit the Road, Jack"" (Am-G-F-E). Furthermore, the melody in this part is f-e-f#, the first two notes of which is reminiscent of a Bb-C-F cadence (the A major chord notwithstanding). However, the melody goes to f# instead, which might explain the lack of resolution, despite there being a dominant-tonic relationship between the chords.  Now the modulation from D major to F major is a bit trickier, and I don't know if I have it down right, but I'll give it a go should you be interested, even though you didn't ask for it.  In Denmark, where I live, a rather large part of functional harmonic analysis deals with four-part chorales, which is awesome but annoying, because it's so centred around Denmark and maybe Germany and the rest of Scandinavia. (I'd actually be really interested in hearing from people from other places around the world, what you think of this explanation. In any case, please take this with a grain of salt.) In chorales, you operate with a tonic (I), subdominant (IV) and dominant (V) as you would otherwise, but the remaining scale degrees also have functions. In a major key, the relative minor of the tonic (vi) is used as either a ""tonic substitute"" (e.g. in a deceptive cadence: V-vi) or as a ""tonic deflection"" or ""diversion"" when used immediately after the tonic (e.g. in I-vi-IV-V). This relationship is not really due to the relative relationship between the chords, but because the vi chord shares the root and third of the I chord, the notes you need to identify the tonic (for voice leading purposes it is very common to omit the fifth in cadences altogether). In minor keys the same is true, as the bVI chord functions in a similar way, sharing the root and third of the tonic.  However, and these are rare in chorales but not unheard of elsewhere*, in major keys one might stumble upon what is called a double deceptive cadence, V-bVI. That is, the dominant is not followed by the tonic, not even the ""tonic substitute"", but the substitute of the parallel tonic (which is called a ""minor tonic substitute"" in Danish). So it is, as the name suggests, doubly deceptive. This is how I view the Em-A-Bbmaj7, which leads nicely into a modulation to F major, of which Bbmaj7 is a subdominant.  *I can't remember off the top of my head where I've seen these before. This I/bVI relationship is however explored e.g. in Scott Joplin's ""Maple Leaf Rag"", though between Ab major and E major (enharmonically equivalent to Fb major, which would be theoretically correct but awful to read).  Also, the reason I enjoy the theory of functional harmony employed in relation to chorales is that it actually explains functionally what's going on in a piece of music, why it works. Roman numeral analysis lacks that in my opinion, or at least you need to be aware of these relationships when writing for instance V-bVI."

musictheory,3adx17,and_It_Swam,4,Fri Jun 19 12:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's generally a way to describe where your left hand is located on the fretboard. It can have 2 meanings. If you simply say ""I'm playing in the first position"" this means your first finger is above the first fret (not necessarily playing it). Second position means that you move your whole hand a fret up so that you first finger is above the second fret etc. This very common for classical guitar but it's used often for acoustic and electric.  If you refer to a scale or an arpeggio though, and you say something like ""I'm playing the first position of the A minor pentatonic scale"" that means that you are playing the A minor pentatonic scale starting from an A, usually with your first finger on the 6th string, 5th fret. The fret itself is not important anymore, the notes you are playing are. So, if you said something like ""I'm playing the second position of the A minor pentatonic scale"" this means that you are playing the notes of the A minor pentatonic scale starting from B, for example with your first or second finger on the 6th string 7th fret. This is equally common for all guitar type methods.   I know this second one is more confusing so check this chart which might help you understand better. I'm choosing the A minor pentatonic scale because it is very simple and very common.   Cheers!  EDIT: Second position starts from C on the 8th fret, there's no B. Sorry."

What I have heard tho is C major start with 2nd finger, or C major start with 4th finger."
musictheory,3adx17,Yeargdribble,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:53:05 2015 UTC,"Technically there is a B in the A pentatonic major scale, though, like he blues scale, by most people referring to them default to the minor.  As for the positions thing, I too have seen this floating around in a lot of circles.  Basically the idea is taking a position that sequences the scale up.  So the positions are basically the single finger scale positions you end up climbing based on your starting note. So if you're playing A on the 6th string you'd play the first position which is basically a 1 4, 1 3, 1 3, 1 3, 1 4, 1 4 finger pattern up and that's first position.  If you start on the C (where your 4 would've been in first position) you'll can start second position and play up and down the scale string to string in pattern of 2 4, 1 4, 1 4, 1 3, 2 4, 2 4.  You just keep moving up that way starting on D, E, and G, before you can repeat first position on the 17th fret with A as the starting point again.  I did some quick Googling and quickly found a source discussing the positions idea for pentatonic scales almost immediately.  I see that positions nomenclature all over the internet.  In fact, I was almost certain this terminology was used in the Jody Fisher jazz guitar books, but upon checking found out that he never actually refers to them that way instead just talking about them as different fingerings for the scale across the fretboard.  That said, from a pedagogical standpoint, I think the positions thing makes a lot more sense and can really help get the concept across, though it obviously does find some limitation, but essentially it's the CAGED  approach to scales.  It gives you something to lock on to.  If you're familiar with your fretboard and your familiar with how each of these scale position shapes fall, you can move quickly from position to position and quickly get your bearings as to where you're at on the neck and what scale shapes are around you to guide you up and down.  That said, I do understand your concern about how muddy the term ends up being since if both are in use your have to rely on context to know what people mean, but that tends to happen a lot in music it seems, and especially in the guitar world."

Different authors and teachers refer to different things on the guitar with different names. It's been a while since I've used a book to study, and I don't have a formal academic training but I've heard a lot of online lessons refer to them as ""positions"" in this context, and some of my old guitar teachers and the books they used called them that. Now as I'm not a jazz guitar player (yet, working on it, hehe) I can't know for sure if the books in this discipline use or don't use the term that way. But I've heard it quite often in lots of online lessons etc. It's generally a very set thing in my mind and it came very naturally to just say that.   The only reason I did anyway is in case he comes across the term used that way, he knows what it's all about. It is definitely a term that's floating around. If not, it's all cool, he'll definitely use the first and most common definition."
musictheory,3adx17,WilliamRValentine,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:16:40 2015 UTC,"The term is used in various ways. As the the other comment points out, it could mean literally which fret your first finger is on or which degree of a scale you start on.   I think more generally, though, it is used to mean something else. If you think of scale patterns or the CAGED chord system, they are basically built around the pattern of repeating roots, or connecting  octaves, across the entire neck, resulting in 5 repeatable shapes. For instance, the C octave, played on the 1st and 3rd frets, that would be the 1st position. The next C octave, played on the 3rd and 5th fret (connected, i.e. sharing a root with 1st position) is position 2. So on and so forth, until you reach 5th position, where the pattern repeats, and if you procede higher up on the neck, you're back to the the same octave fingering you had in first position, just higher on the neck.  To add to this, sometimes scale patterns are referred to as being in 1st, or whatever position regardless of the key, starting fret etc, simply because the pattern or scale box is referred to as first. So, the first fret fingering could be referred to as 3rd position, or any position, for that matter, depending on which key you're in. But the same connected repetition principle applies. 5th position is connected to 1st as you move higher up the neck."

musictheory,3aczt6,ATownHoldItDown,2,Fri Jun 19 02:45:23 2015 UTC,This is great  I think that to illustrate that JI is dependant of the scale used as reference you should write down the JI associate with the Cminor scale (relative minor of Eb major).  The space between tune will be completely different that the JI from Cmajor. The ET will be somewhere between JI Cminor and JI Cmajor.  Maybe it is possible to a 3 level graph like your 2 level graph with :  Cmajor JI bar representation  ET bar représentation  Cminor JI bar representation  That way it will be clear that if you want to be able to play Cmajor and Cminor JI you have to be able to change significantly the space between note of your instrument. It is not always possible so => ET
musictheory,3aczt6,Kramalimedov,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:27 2015 UTC,"I see why that would be valuable as a graph, but I'm limiting myself to one sheet of paper.

This worksheet augments a set of scale exercises where they will play Bb Major and G minor scales against a the fundamental to try to open their ears up. Each scale step lists the adjustment in cents."

musictheory,3a9itk,RJB6,6,Thu Jun 18 08:20:49 2015 UTC,"I bet they didn't count it that way, because of where the bass comes in.    If I was transcribing this I'd call the first measure 4/4 and the guitar starts on beat 1.  The bass comes in on the ""and"" of 3 and hits a long sustained note on 1 of the 2nd measure.  I'd call the 2nd measure 9/8. Then at the 3rd measure it's back to 4/4 for rest of the song.    I'd count the measure of 9/8 by counting 8th notes 123451234, since the drum fill occupies the last 4 8th notes of time in the measure.  So it's 12345-drum-fill and then he starts playing time on the downbeat of the 3rd measure.    Or do it however works for you.  There's more than one solution.  That's just how I would do it.    Cheers!"
musictheory,3a9itk,Confoundicator,6,Thu Jun 18 09:29:48 2015 UTC,"This is how the Beatles Complete Scores does it. How it came about is interesting. The guitar instigates the aberrant 9/8 measure, so I find it hard to imagine that was the last thing to be added."
musictheory,3a9itk,mohriner,3,Thu Jun 18 15:33:56 2015 UTC,My guess is that the guitar intro is an overdub and the actual take was just Paul on bass and Ringo's fill on the drums. I could be wrong though.
musictheory,3a9itk,dtm106,6,Thu Jun 18 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"No you are probably right. Paul played the solo, most likely the intro, too.  ""I helped out such a lot in all the arrangements. There were a lot of tracks though where I played bass. Paul played lead guitar on Taxman, and he played guitar - a good part - on Drive My Car.  We laid the track because what Paul would do, if he's written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say, 'Do this.' He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something. But on Drive My Car I just played the line, which is really like a lick off Respect, you know, the Otis Redding version - and I played that line on guitar and Paul laid that with me on bass. We laid the track down like that. We played the lead part later on top of it."" George Harrison, 1977 Crawdaddy"

musictheory,3a65tm,TheFreakingBatman,2,Thu Jun 18 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"That takes a little more information than you've given. Do you want to major in performance, and if so, in what? If you want to major in theory, are you okay with being an academic? What kinds of schools are you looking at?"
musictheory,3a65tm,ediblesprysky,2,Thu Jun 18 06:48:30 2015 UTC,"None yet. I really want to pursue music but I know that doesn't always work out for everyone so I'd planned on majoring in something else and minoring in music.   I've got awhile til college, it was more of a general question. Probably a dumb question at that since the answer probably varies."
musictheory,3a65tm,TheFreakingBatman,2,Thu Jun 18 06:54:23 2015 UTC,"Not at all a dumb question! At least you can find out how it varies.   I find that, for all the arts, you have to pursue them wholeheartedly if you want to make them a career. If you don't devote your entire freaking life (for a little while, at least) to succeeding in performance, you're very unlikely to make it unless you're some kind of insane genius. And I've found that people who have fallbacks often end up using them. So I've very rarely met someone who didn't major in music who ended up as a high-level professional musician--they're out there, but they're often at a disadvantage because they have to do it on their own.   In my opinion, if you really want to go into music, major in it. You can double-major or minor in something else as a fallback, but you need to give any artistic career your top priority for it to work. And if it doesn't work out, you know what? I know people who have gone into banking, law, programming--all sorts of very ""practical"" jobs--with music degrees. It's still a college degree, and it can get you somewhere."

Besides, if the solution is to use your ears if it doesn't work, why not start there instead?  I mean, that's how all actual musicians determine what key something is in.  It's a better solution than starting from the first/last chords because it works 100% of the time, and it takes very little practice to develop the skill.  It's a skill we all possess intuitively (otherwise we would not be able to make any sense of what we are listening to) but just needs to be understood intellectually.  Using the first/last chord doesn't work a large percentage of the time and then you have to fall back on using your ears anyway."

musictheory,3a65tm,young_mcdonald,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:22:18 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer: look for which note is more important and feels like ""home"".  That's the tonic.  How do you do this?  Sing the piece.  Maybe improvise a bit using the same feel as the original piece.  See where you land.  Do you land on F# minor?  On A major?  On something else entirely?  In any case, this is something you do by hearing it with your ears, not by looking at it on paper (though you can of course look at it on paper in order to hear it with your ears).  In particular, don't bother with the key signature.  If you don't know what you're doing yet, the key signature is misleading.  The not-so-obvious answer: sometimes composers are deliberately ambiguous about this kind of thing."
musictheory,3a65tm,xiipaoc,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:11:02 2015 UTC,"Like someone already said, it all has to do with where you think the music resolves. What chord feels like home? What pitch feels like it is the start of the key? Some songs are quite obviously one or the other, but some songs are hard to tell, or rather, hard to decide. Listen to I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys, and you'll get what I mean. The verses all start on an f# minor chord, and we don't get an A major chord until the conclusion of the chorus. To me, it feels like that song is in A major, because A sounds more conclusive than f#. Someone else could say the inverse and be just as right. It all depends on where you find resolution.   Get Lucky by Daft Punk is in neither major nor minor, but I think I'll be getting too off topic if we go into that.   Quick edit: On the subject of resolution, a chord progression of V - I is typically the strongest one that a composer has in his bag of tricks. If you see a key signature with three sharps and you need to decide if it's f# or A, the presence of a C# major chord is a likely indicator of f# minor, because C# is the V chord in f#. This isn't a fail safe method, because you're certainly ""allowed"" to have a C# chord in A major, but can be a quick hint when you have sheet music in front of you.  Tldr; depends on where you feel like the music resolves"

Chord progression is Bm7 D F#m7 E.  It's either F# minor or B dorian (B natural minor with a raised sixth), depending on your interpretation. A little ambiguous, but it certainly has a minor feel emanating from somewhere. I'm more inclined toward B dorian, as both the dominant and subdominant chord are present. i ♭III v IV makes more sense than iv ♭VI i ♭VII."
musictheory,3a65tm,Xenoceratops,4,Wed Jun 17 16:56:00 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's in B minor.  The E major chord is just a borrowed chord from the parallel major key.  Not Uncommon.

Breathe by Pink Floyd for example has Em-A7 progression (ii-V) and while it is tempting to say the song is in Em or Gmaj it is actually in Dmaj or Bmin... As for when a song is considered major or minor I believe has more to do with the sound you're getting/going for, that is to say neither is more right than the other... I hope this helps!"
musictheory,3a65tm,Dropturdsonyou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Well that's kind of a big question, particularly in the case of A major/F# minor (since they're enharmonic equivalents).   In this particular case, it's about the tonic -- where does the music resolve? In some cases this could be where a phrase begins or ends, but overall it's really about feel. Some songs never resolve (Get Lucky, for a recent popular example) so it can honestly be hard to tell."
musictheory,3a65tm,pokealex,30,Wed Jun 17 15:23:08 2015 UTC,They're not enharmonic equivalents. They're relative keys.    A major is the relative major of F# minor. Gb minor would be enharmonic equivalent to F# minor.

I don't remember if it has a name, but it  is fairly common to see.   It works because of the voice leading from C to F minor.   C E G goes to F Ab C  So the G and E voices both move only a single semitone to the Ab and F respectively, while the C remains constant."

This serves to temporarily treat G like the tonic, by leading to it with D7, which is the dominant chord if you were in G. You might see it referred to as the V/V, or the five of five, because it is the fifth of the fifth.  Another one you might come across, especially in jazz, is a tritone substitution. Say you have a Dm7 G7 Cmaj7 chord progression; the classic ii-V-I used throughout jazz. What you can do is replace the G7 with the chord a tritone away, which is Db7.  The two chords look like this:  G B D F  Db F Ab B  You'll notice that they both share the B and F notes. Those are the ones that create the tension that is resolved by the C major chord, so using the Db7 instead of G7 fills the same role harmonically. Also, it creates some nice chromatic movement, as the bass notes go D Db C.  I hope this makes sense, and anyone else feel free to correct me if i screwed something up."
musictheory,3a6jic,Mikep98,2,Wed Jun 17 18:04:46 2015 UTC,"To elaborate a bit on some of the other answers: the harmonic minor scale is a modification to the natural minor scale in which the 7th scale degree is raised by a semitone. This has the effect of making the chord built on the fifth scale degree major instead of minor. The reason this sounds pleasing is because it creates voice leading back to the root when going V-I. As /u/Mikep98 pointed out:    C E G goes to F Ab C So the G and E voices both move only a single semitone to the Ab and F respectively, while the C remains constant.   I find it helpful to think of the harmonic minor scale not really as a scale of its own, separate from the natural minor scale, but to think of it as a modification of the natural minor scale that is used in certain situations. If you are going to play Five-One in a minor key, it will sound nice if the Five is major. But if you are not playing Five-One, then the major V chord may sound off, and the raised 7th degree may sound ""out"".   ""House of the Rising Sun"" is a popular song that uses the major V in a minor key. The progression Am - E - Am on the line ""Lord, I know I'm one"" is an example. The E is a major V in the key of Am. Also, here is a song that my son loves, where the major V is very prominent. Listen at around 0:50, over the line, ""And works out in the sun."" Here the ""out-ness"" of the major V builds tension that is then released by the return to the minor root chord.  https://youtu.be/MXhhXXsxSfE?t=41s  I haven't actually worked out the chords of that song, but the sound of the major V in a minor key is so distinct that I'm pretty confident in the analysis.  EDIT: There is also a bit of circular logic going on with the major V / harmonic minor scale. Is the major V out of key? No! It's in key for the harmonic minor. Oh. So basically, it is out of key, but since it sounds nice, we'll make up a fancy name just for that one exception? Sure! That's what theory boils down to: if it sounds good, it's not wrong, and we'll make up a name for it and put it in the books."
musictheory,3a6jic,and_It_Swam,2,Wed Jun 17 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"Very well written comment, I like both of these explanations a lot:   I find it helpful to think of the harmonic minor scale not really as a scale of its own, separate from the natural minor scale, but to think of it as a modification of the natural minor scale that is used in certain situations.  That's what theory boils down to: if it sounds good, it's not wrong, and we'll make up a name for it and put it in the books."
musictheory,3a6jic,and_It_Swam,2,Wed Jun 17 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"Simply harmonic minor! :) It's the minor key utilized very often by classical music. It simply has an augmented seventh degree, because it makes that note create a feeling of tension leading to the root. It also makes the V chord a major (or Dominant 7) chord."
musictheory,3a6jic,smaxwell87,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:10:59 2015 UTC,But then what about the Ab chord? It's not completely in harmonic minor then right?
musictheory,3a6jic,Mikep98,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course, I should have elaborated.  It's more of a practical thing really. :) The thinking is more of a ""I wrote 4 chords in F natural minor, but I want the last one (C minor) feel like it's leading strongly to the root chord (F minor). So I will augment that Eb in the C chord to make it an E natural.""  Incidentally, the reason this works is because this C major chord belongs to the F harmonic minor scale as a V dominant.   Generally, major chords create a strong resolution sound (especially if you add a minor 7th to them) when they resolve to any major or minor chord a fourth above, just like C major to F minor does.   But in the end this is just a musical situation which you can justify through various means. I prefer the ""this sounds good because this thing happened"" approach. In this case, if I wanted to emulate the sound of this chord progression, I would choose a minor scale, take 4 chords from that scale and make sure to use the natural 7 degree of the scale in one of the first three and then the augmented 7 on the last.   I hope this makes sense. Theory is just observations we make to try and emulate a specific sound. If you get what happened, you can do it yourself!  EDIT: Oh and the reason things sound natural and seamless to our ears is because we hear them often. Yes, this is indeed a very common thing to happen (augmenting a natural 7) so it doesn't sound odd."
musictheory,3a6jic,medina_sod,3,Thu Jun 18 20:41:22 2015 UTC,"It's a i-VI-III-V in F minor. As Mikep98 said, it's very common for a major V chord to be used in a minor key. The C major chord is a borrowed from the F harmonic minor scale.    Also, if you are in the key of F minor, C# and G# are Db and Ab."

Sure, it can be angry, but it can also be proud, disgusted, pious, sultry, peaceful, rowdy, warning, or sorrowful. A lot of the time, it doesn't convey emotional content, because its telling a story or illustrating a particular image.   Don't contribute the the shallowness of music by sterotyping."

musictheory,3a63qq,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's rather an oversimplification to say that any particular genre could be associated with a single emotion or state. Genres are really just a set of idiomatic guidelines which composers can use to conform to or break expectations to create the particular balance of tension and relief required to express whatever emotions that they want to.   Using your example of metal, I'm a fan of a lot of the more progressive, tech-death acts subgenres that have emerged in the last 20 years or so, but I'm not at all an angry person. Although the genre may be associated with anger or aggression to some people, I personally find it soothing and relaxing, I find that the whole swirling, dense, polyrhythmic texture has a sort of chaotic 'white noise' or 'rain on a tin roof' effect where the unpredictability and complexity or the rhythms wash over you and drown out the trivial rather than urge you to action. That's a very relaxing experience for me - I regularly go to sleep to death metal.  To use another example, Nick Cave's album Murder Ballads is written largely about a set of characters and situations entered around murder (often mass-murder). While this is a rather morbid subject matter, and could lead one to assume that Nick is a morbid person or that the music is meant to inspire negative emotions or thoughts, Nick himself has regularly said that he's actually a rather positive person, and that he used that album (as well as similar tracks on other albums) as a sort of outlet for negative feelings and that singing those songs actually really cheers him up and puts him in a good mood - the same could be said of listening to them."

Your first option is to use a MIDI controller and record into an audio program like FL Studio. Plus most DAW's should have an automatic quantizer that can try to fit your playing into proper notes. Might have to move some things around, but that's one way to do it. Your other option is just to set up a click track to play to and record your tapping on a surface directly in with a mic. Then try to match the note lengths up after the fact with a synth and translate that into the correct score.  Sorry, my perspective is more from the DAW recording angle instead of the musical notation angle, so that's how I think about it. :)"

musictheory,3a3qcw,FullOfEels,6,Wed Jun 17 00:08:01 2015 UTC,"(This may have been answered by the post which has since been deleted, but I will just leave this here for anyone else who may be confused)  Think of it like this:  A key and a scale are not NECESSARILY the same thing. A key is like a grab bag, from which you may select 7 (or 8, or 9, or 12, or 26, or...) notes and you then place those in an order, from lowest sounding to highest sounding -- at which point, you now have a scale.  The notes in the KEY of C major are:  A F G D E B C  The C major SCALE is this:  C D E F G A B C  Now because of this, saying something is in a particular key doesn't always exemplify the correct FEEL of a song. I can play a chord progression that is Am | Dm | Em | Am and say ""this song is in the key of C,"" until the cows come home because Am is A C E, Dm is D F A, and Em is E G B, all of which are notes within 'the key of C,' but that doesn't make me right. Such a chord progression would FEEL as though it were in the key of A minor, despite the fact that the notes contained within the key of C and the key of Am are 100% identical.  The notes in the key of A minor are also:  A F G D E B C   But, the A minor scale is this:  A B C D E F G A  The only difference is the note on which you happen to start. The keys of C major and A minor are known to be each other's relative major (or minor) as they have different feels. The difference is in which chord is represented as what's called the 'tonic' of a song. That's just a word for what would be called the root note. The verse to this song is very much in the key of B minor, and at the very end contains some nice chord changes that lead us into the FEEL of the relative major key, without actually needing to use what would be called ""The One Chord"" (written as roman numeral 1 -- I) thanks to the way the notes in the ""Ain't no mountain high enough.."" lyrics interact with the chords against which they are being sung; it's almost like math saying ""2+2=9-5"" rather than just blatantly saying ""2+2=4"".  It's a brilliant arrangement choice, and the main reason it works is because of what are called 'modes', which are well introduced here.  Does that make sense?"

musictheory,3a3qcw,MiskyWilkshake,4,Wed Jun 17 00:22:17 2015 UTC,"Not impossible, but perhaps not satisfying.  ""In the key of..."" really has 3 meanings: key signature, scale, and tonic chord.  They're usually, but not always, the same.  Modal tunes have a tonic chord and scale that don't match the key signature - Miles Davis' ""So What"" has a key signature of C, but it's in D Dorian.  And you could have a melody that firmly resolves to a tonic - let's say D - but it could be harmonized with a different chord, like a G major in second inversion.  It would give you a somewhat unsettled effect, but if that's what you're going for, nobody's going to throw you in the music theory jail."

musictheory,3a1poy,cmparkerson,2,Tue Jun 16 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"If I understand your question with respect to Sonata-Allegro form (a single movement of a Symphony, usually the first), you're asking if any composer has written a minuet to serve as the Development section following the Exposition, is that correct? If that's your question, I don't know of any off the top of my head, but there might be some relatively unknown work where this has been attempted.   The trouble is that the Development usually consists of three ideas, the principle theme, the subordinate theme, and an optional 'development section' theme that all sort of 'debate' and create upheaval for the tonal center. In doing so, the idea of a Minuet achieving this sort of design might not make much sense to those ""in the know"" of Sonata form.   But don't let that stop you from searching for an example or creating a piece in sonata form that substitutes a minuet for the development section. I wish I could be more helpful. Best of luck in your search!"
musictheory,3a1poy,Salemosophy,2,Tue Jun 16 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"You understand my question exactly. I am talking about Sonata Allegro form, and yes I am trying to create such a piece, simply as a""What would happen if"" kind of thing. I didn't know if anyone has ever tried it before. It is also proving to be quite a difficult exercise , at least to write it in a way that makes sense. I also started the exposition in 7/8 and then moved to 3/4. So yes its a little weird, but I enjoy composing and sometimes some mental gymnastics makes it a bit entertaining."
musictheory,3a1poy,nmitchell076,2,Tue Jun 16 19:33:57 2015 UTC,"The closest thing to what you are describing might be found in the sort of da capo / sonata fusion arias that crop up in the 1770s.  The da capo aria has a ternary structure: ABA, with the A sections being staged as a binary form that sets the first stanza text twice, and the B section setting the second stansa once, usually contrasting in key, and often in tempo and Meter.   The fusion aria does the following: you get the first run through the first stanza text like it's a normal da capo aria (moving to the dominant), then you get the B section as a contrasting middle, often in a new tempo and invoking a new topic. Then you get a full recapitulation.   To illustrate: https://youtu.be/ZHO3S92KYGI  Skipping over the opening ritornello, the first theme may be heard at :58. A transition at 1:21. MC at 1:52, followed  by the second theme. EEC at 2:32, followed by a ritornello. Development begins at 2:41, but we soon collapse into what is basically the da capo middle section at 3:12, accompanied by a shift in meter to 2/4. Recapitulation begins at 4:04.  There's a similar thing that happens in Mozart's ""Marten aller arten"", but that's also invoking elements of the Type 2 sonata (where we don't get a full recap, but only the secondary theme).   What accompanies all of these is a distinct shift in focus. We change text to say something very different then what we were saying. Imagine the character undergoing a sudden change in perspective, perhaps saying ""no"" to the situation they find themselves in in the the first stanza and using the new topic as a means of ""escape."" There are, of course, many interpretive options. But they all will capture some sort of dramatic change or shift that occurs at the exposition/development juncture."

If you mean a multi movement work with the title of Sonata, then the middle or last movement could be a minuet.

musictheory,39yjrc,magusg,3,Tue Jun 16 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  The subjects being studied should generally not know what the hypothesis is or what the experiment is, because this can introduce a bias in their reporting. If you are testing out a new drug, you'll have two or more groups of people, one receiving the drug and one receiving sugar pills, and you don't want the patients to know which is which.  However, when doing research it is very important to have a hypothesis before carrying out certain experiments. The problem is that if you just collect a bunch of data (about anything), you are very likely to find patterns in there. Even in completely random data you are likely to find certain patterns which are only there due to chance and are not true patterns of the underlying data if you will. As an example, if you collected 100 different attributes of a group of people, you will find things like shoe size correponding to hair colour or something else ridiculous that has no true relationship but is just there due to chance.  In a nutshell, the problem is that looking for any pattern you will find something, which is why (as a researcher) you should pick your hypothesis first (i.e. you should look for a specific pattern).  That said, there is nothing wrong with exploratory analysis per se, where you do look at a bunch of data to look for patterns, but you have to be aware that what you find can not be presented as a result. If you find something that you think may be a true pattern, you need to pick that as your hypothesis and conduct a completely new study with new data and new subjects."

Normally if you're using an E chord (chord V) you'll sharpen the g in the harmony and the melody should match this. And if you want to emphasise motion towards a sharpen the g to make it the leading tone. If you only sharpen the g its the harmonic minor scale which sounds really nice too. Use your ears :)"

The harmonic minor gives the 7th more of a kick so that when you resolve it feels a little better.    The melodic minor bumps up the 6th to ease the transition for moving into the 7th."

But if you're writing in the common period practice language (like for a homework assignment), the purpose of melodic minor is to avoid augmented seconds — that is, going from F natural to G sharp or vice versa. So do the following:   Write your melody using the natural minor scale (using F natural and G natural). Then, go back and raise all the leading tones (change all Gs to G sharps). Finally, look for any places where F and G sharp are next to each other. If F comes first (F -> G sharp), then raise the F to F sharp. If G sharp comes first (G sharp -> F), then lower the G sharp back to G natural."

The chorus is the hook - that's her MO.  The verse is usually ""eh"" filler material.  The chorus, though, everyone remembers (See Shake it off).  Another example would be the intro riff for purple haze.  That's a hook too.  As soon as you hear it, you know it's purple haze.  Hooks can be placed anywhere and be instrumental or vocal.  Themes in classical music can be considered hooks, I suppose, like the duh duh duh duhh in Beethoven's 5th.  You can have a drum hook - I'd say the drums in ""In the Air Tonight"" can be considered a hook.  The stepwise organ in Whiter Shade of pale is  example of a more subtle hook that makes the tune extremely recognizable."

Furthermore, you should also assume that any chords written with extensions (9, 11, 13) are dominant, unless they tell you otherwise, which is just something to be aware of.  In reference to your question, the chord that you can derive from the dorian mode would be min13, while the chord you get from aeolian would be min7(b13), although you usually see this written as min(b6) or min9(b6).  applying these methods to the other modes, you would end up with:    Mode Pitches Chord    Ionian 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Maj13   Dorian 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 min13   Phrygian 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 min7(b9b13)   Lydian 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 Maj13(#11)   Mixolydian 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 13   Aeolian 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 Min7(b13)   Locrain 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7 Min7b5(b9b13)    There is a lot more you can do with this, but i hope this was a good introduction for you"

As for Riemann himself. His Vereinfachte Harmonielehre of 1893 has a public domain English translation published as Harmony simplified: or, The theory of the tonal functions of chords.

musictheory,39y8ue,awkwardhipsters,3,Mon Jun 15 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"Medieval English sacred music was some of the first to incorporate first-inversion chords. Parallel first inversions were prominent in the genre of carols. The typical ""countenance angloise,"" known as the sweet English sound was later adopted by Burgundian composers as fauxbourdon. Listen to John Dunstable for examples. If there were multiple voices, the English compositions were fairly homorhythmic at this time compared to French motet. Later, English madrigal was more lighthearted than its Italian counterpart. Bawdy humor was common. The musical text was frequently conveyed with word painting, such as Thomas Weelkes' ""As Vesta Was Descending."" Thomas Tallis and William Byrd wrote both secular madrigal and sacred music for Catholic and Anglican services. Regarding instruments, airs, typically solo voice with lute, were one of the primary secular styles. Check out John Dowland for those.   Handel was infatuated with Italy and spent a large amount of time there so his style is more reflective of Italian opera than the English music tradition. Henry Purcell cemented one of music's more emblematic basslines, like you mentioned, in his opera Dido and Aeneas with ""Dido's Lament."" It's a descending chromatic bassline that would be associated with lamentation from then on.   Particularly with rock and roll, English popular music took tons of influence from blues; Led Zeppelin covered Memphis Minnie's ""When the Levee Breaks"" and The Rolling Stones adapted the style for albums like ""Exile on Main Street"" and ""Sticky Fingers."" Even the Beatles ""Oh Darling"" borrows from soul music.  Pretty brief overview but I hope it helps!"

When people think of Handel as an English composer, they probably imagine his writing for chorus (e.g. the Hallelujah chorus from the Messiah)... England has a long tradition of choral singing that this association probably taps into.  Later English composers (e.g. Vaughan Williams & Delius) worked to make their music sound English by giving it a quasi-modal sound to evoke folk music. Usually this involved lowering the leading tone (e.g. using Mixolydian instead of major, Dorian instead of melodic minor).  As for rock, I'm not the person to ask, but I'd imagine that the shadow of the Beatles/Rolling Stones looms large."

I say strictly speaking because we're assuming your chord has only the notes you mentioned: the root, the minor third above the root, and the minor sixth above the root.  With a root of C, this would give us C-Eb-Ab, the first inversion of an Ab major chord.   To better answer your question, we would need to know the full spelling of the chord you're playing as well as the context/progression. Then we could see the chord and it's function."
musictheory,39waxd,iamthenev,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"The song I'm thinking of in particular kind of switches between B dorian and F# minor, during the chorus the chords are: F#mb6 (F#-A-D-A-C#), Bm6 (B-G#-D-F#) and C#7 (C#-B-E#). I also sometimes add a minor 7th (E) at the top of the F#mb6. I always thought of it as a simple i-iv-V progression. This is on guitar, by the way, that's why the weird voicings."
musictheory,39waxd,iamthenev,2,Mon Jun 15 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"No worries about the voicings.  Well, from your context you have a standard progression, with some flavourful extensions on your chords lol which is totally fine, that's the wonderful thing about music and composing; you do what sounds good to you and share it with the world.   From a musical notation standpoint, you would have to specify that the added sixth to your chords is a flat six. That's all."

musictheory,39waxd,watteva,2,Tue Jun 16 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"As pallit said, it's a first inversion major triad. With a sixth and a third, you don't have a 7th (You'd need a 2nd, 4th, or 5th, too). Emb6 is possible, but the implication is that the C is an embellishment on the Em chord, so you would have to view it in context (If the C moves down to B, and the B is more stable, and the other chords support Em, then Emb6 makes sense)."
musictheory,39waxd,BroseppeVerdi,0,Mon Jun 15 14:58:51 2015 UTC,"minor b6 e.g. Amb6 would be A-C-E-F but I usually view that chord as a maj7 in 1st inversion, so in this case it would be Fmaj7/A."
musictheory,39waxd,PygmyTwylyte,0,Mon Jun 15 11:09:37 2015 UTC,"If you built it off a ""I"" in the key of C, this would be an Ab major in first inversion. Dat borrowed chord, doe."
musictheory,39waxd,beiaard,-1,Mon Jun 15 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"When used in certain contexts it is called a Neapolitan chord, but unless it appears as preparation for the dominant (often as a substitute for iv, for example the notes F Ab Db in the key of C minor), /u/pallit's interpretation probably makes more sense.   EDIT: To be clear, if you play four chords: Cm, Fm(min6), G7, Cm, the second chord can be called a neapolitan because of where it appears in the chord sequence. If you only play the chord Fm(min6), it doesn't make sense to call it a neapolitan."
musictheory,39waxd,PygmyTwylyte,3,Mon Jun 15 15:44:51 2015 UTC,"No, I'm afraid this is not correct. A neapolitan chord is simply what you might call a bII. I mean, yes, what OP described could be a neapolitan chord, but any major chord could be a neapolitan chord if it were functioning as bII (FYI, if you're reading along at home, never analyze something as a bII -- I'm just using that as it would just be counterproductive to keep saying ""neapolitan"" over and over again).   Perhaps what you got confused about is that neapolitan chords are found, in the vast majority of cases, in first inversion (which is what the OP is describing)? This is due to the fact that it's easier to avoid parallelism this way, and this is also why they're generally called neapolitan 6 (N6) chords. There's nothing about the first inversion nature of it that makes it neapolitan, though -- that's simply a result of its function."

musictheory,39waxd,iamthenev,-2,Mon Jun 15 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"a lot of people here are saying that it's just an inverted major seventh, and that accounts for the spelling just fine. however, in function, that idea breaks down.  i just recorded a jazz tune in Gm whose head section repeated Gm6 - Eb7 - D7. even if we spelled that as an Ebmaj7, that puts the chord progression using roman numerals as #VI - VI - V7, instead of i - VI - V7. the Gm6 makes so much more sense in that context."
musictheory,39waxd,crossanlogan,2,Mon Jun 15 15:33:31 2015 UTC,"I believe you mixing things up here. Your Gm6 chord does not have a minor sixth, which is what OP is asking about. The Gm6 in your progression would be G-Bb-D-E. At least, this is the typical minor chord with added sixth spelling."
musictheory,39waxd,saxguy2001,-1,Mon Jun 15 15:47:47 2015 UTC,"my Gm chord does have a minor 6. it's G-Bb-D-Eb, all tones diatonic to the Gm scale, which is an inversion of an Ebmaj7."
musictheory,39waxd,BdaMann,5,Mon Jun 15 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"Then you'd have to call it Gm(b6).  Gm6 implies an unaltered 6th, and unaltered means as it relates to a major scale, even if the triad is minor.  And as for your first paragraph in your first post, that's why context is so important, too."

Funk, imo, is all about the attack, the transients of notes and subtlety in rhythm, ghosted notes. Generally, clean guitars, drums, bass, maybe a hornline, keys. Chords tend to be 7ths, 6ths, 9ths. There is a stereotype that guitars need wah/auto wah but that is not at all necessary. Everything feels alive and moves forward. The Beatles had some grooves: Paperback Writer, Taxman, Hey Bulldog.

musictheory,39ubrh,xiMbd03u1,9,Mon Jun 15 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's rooted in the sophisticated syncopation of the bass line on unconventional, blues-based progressions. If you know a blues scale on a bass and feel funky, you can actually, with a bit of practice, start cranking out your own funky bass lines.  Hm... there may be more to it though; Thinking through Prince's catalog I remember his guitar riffs more than the bass rhythm, and that might have more to do with it. I would say whether it's the bass or the whole orchestration, syncopation has to be a key."
musictheory,39ubrh,did_it_before,8,Mon Jun 15 01:37:37 2015 UTC,"For the sake of comparison, let's think of rock music first. A 4/4 rock tune will focus mostly on the 1, 2, 3, and 4 beats and the eighth notes in between. A funk tune will still stress these beats (particularly coming back on the one) but what makes it funky is that the song will throw in heavy attacks on syncopated rhythms (particularly the ee or uh in sixteenth notes (counted 1-ee-and-uh 2-ee-and-uh)). The attacks on these off-beats are strongly accentuated and well-coordinated by the band. It is essential for a funk band to be tight.   Because of the importance of these strong hits while maintaining a steady rhythm, you'll see familiar instrumentation and techniques used by funk bands. This includes slap and pop bass technique, horns, synth, wah guitar, and skilled ghost-notes on the snare. These common instrumentation and techniques are in my opinion not what makes something funky, but they're just really great tools to do so.  Aside from the rhythm, you'll also see that funk uses a lot of the same chords. Dominant 9's, 13s, 11s.   I'll link a few great funk tunes. Listen in and count along with the 1, 2, 3, 4. Let the funk shock your brain with every beautifully syncopated hit that comes in between the 1/2/3/4, for therein lies the funk:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjl6XIlvfn0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAatPPEaZDA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFbo8I2KkR8  EDIT: Clarity.

I'm not really sure if this is going to be your kind of thing, but from a heavily metal-influenced perspective, this gives a really great example of the use of the snare drum generating the groove of several phrases and passages. Especially from 0:52 and 4:24, the syncopated snare drum has so much influence that it adds a lot to the doubling of the frequency of rhythmic pulses, if you get what I'm saying."

Coltrane is already playing around with the idea of rapid harmonic switches. There are at least 8 ""key"" changes (ii-V's) in the head.  The V-I progressions in ""Giant Steps"" continue in the same vein of fast harmonic movement. Coltrane decides to just skip the ii chord in this case. The history of the major 3rd movement is explained in the wiki that /u/MaxSkorpion linked:  The bridge of the Rodgers and Hart song and jazz standard ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" (1937) predated Tadd Dameron's ""Lady Bird"", after which Coltrane named his ""Lazy Bird"", by incorporating modulation by major third(s).  From a soloist's perspective, it's common to ""switch keys"" for each V-I within the progression. I would never think of ""Giant Steps"" as being:  bIII7 - bVIMaj7 - VII7 - IIIMaj7 - V - I  but rather a sequence of 3 V-I's.

If you wanted minor, you would stick with plain old Ger+6. The common tone thing is the basis of Fr+6 (the #4 on Fr+6 becomes 5 on V), and my harmony teacher taught a ø7 sonority augmented sixth that preempted the third of V as well. Your chord works along that line of thinking."

Except that its ""free note"" is a #5 instead of 3 (Italian), #4 (French), or 5 (German).  It's not strange; it's just a little non-standard."

It's a reference to theory that only some universities teach, and only to juniors or seniors.  It's an objective way of classifying chords. The process for going from a chord to a number like (014) is complicated, but the reverse is easy. Pick a note to start on, like D, and a ""set class"" like (0258). Then choose whether to go up or down. I'll go down. Let D=0, then count in semitones. 2 below D = C, 5 below D = A, 8 below D = F#. So I use those 4 note names (D, C, A, F#) in whatever order or octave I want. The result is a dominant seventh chord! If I had gone up instead of down, I would have gotten a half-diminished seventh. So (0258) means those two chord qualities.  (014) and (0157) are less familiar chord types (e.g. (G,G#,B) and (C,C#,F,G)) which is why this system can be useful."

musictheory,39s36r,leoholt,9,Sun Jun 14 05:22:10 2015 UTC,"Are you trying out different chord qualities? (eg Major 7, half-dim, min6, 7b5, etc)  Using different harmonic qualities evoke different progressions based on the sheer fact that what comprises harmonies are merely the voices attributed to each chordal tone, and as such a greater variety of chordal tone qualities will expand your ear's creativity in hearing their tendency to step in different directions.    For example, a I vi IV V progression can be played as I vi minMaj7 IV Maj7#11 and lead you nicely into a bVI Maj7 ... the voices step into each other with minimum movement.  But then you'll have to think of your phrases/statements because you'll be actively reifying the listener's perception of resolution.    Sorry if this sounds too over the top, but it should be good advice to someone who knows how to experiment with chords and progressions.  I've been interested lately in a book called Audacious Euphony which argues close relations of chords to be linked by the individual voices' movements as opposed to traditional harmonic progressions.  In this way, a I and a bVI chord are actually more closely related that a I and a V chord! (In C: C Major (C E G) is only 2 half step voice-movements away from A-flat Major (C Eb Ab); C Major to G Major is 3 half-step voice-movements (C E G --> B D G).)"
musictheory,39s36r,I_love_hiromi,8,Sun Jun 14 07:51:30 2015 UTC,"Well... have you tried writing music that isn't just a bunch of chords in a row?  I think the quality of your chord progressions isn't the problem.  I think it's the fact that you're writing chord progressions that is.  Write some melodies and make them interesting.  The vast majority of music in the world doesn't worry about ""chord progressions"".  There's plenty of good music out there that never strays beyond I's and V's, and possibly IV's.  Hell, blues is based on only three chords, I, IV, and V (not that people don't make it more interesting by adding more chords).  Let the melody lead the way, and your harmony can be as boring or as interesting as you want and it will still sound good.  Got some common tones?  Go down a third and modulate, then get back to the tonic using a sequence.  For example:  You're in C major.  C major chord, C in the melody.  Where are you going next?  Well, it's bridge time.  Go to Ab.  Where to?  Bb, Eb.  A IV - V - I in Eb major.  Then repeat in Db: Gb - Ab - Db.  How are you going to get back to C?  Ab - G - C.  Obviously there are many other possibilities for doing something similar here.  I'm not even sure that this one is all that great, because there are way too many major chords.  In any case, you have a big circle of fifths, don't you?  Use it!  And let the melody guide you -- melody and voice leading, since the individual notes of the chords you use make their own melodies too.  Just don't only write ""chord progressions""."
musictheory,39s36r,xiipaoc,4,Sun Jun 14 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"You're restricting yourself by only using chord progressions that cadence V-I (the so-called authentic cadence).  In rock music, there exist chord progressions that cadence IV-I (the so-called plagal cadence), e.g. I-bVII-IV-I and I-V-vi-IV.  There are also chord progressions that deny a return to the I chord. My favorite is ii-iii-IV-V.  All of these progressions are relatively simple, but readily avoid the V-I principle, and it is no harder to create larger chord progressions using these principles than that one. And it's definitely possible to sound ""classical"" without submitting to V-I (the whole of the 20th century was dedicated to this). Try, instead of using ""classical"" harmony, using these harmonies, and then compensating by using older styles of instrumentation, or using a classical approach to form."

Whether this is something that exists in the blues in actuality is debatable, but whatever.  I ♭III I ♭V IV  I ♭VII ♭III IV  Replace with minor chords at your leisure.  There's also this system that uses the natural minor scale to inform the roots of the chords, but then harmonizes them all as major triads:  I II ♭III IV V ♭VI ♭VII  or, in C:  C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭  You can do it with minor chords as well, though it's less common:  i ii ♭iii iv v ♭vi ♭vii  Cm Dm E♭m Fm Gm A♭m B♭m"

I'd recommend two things on top of the chord-related advice already given here.  First, vary your harmonic rhythm. Have chords last twice as long in one section as compared to another. Change on beats 3 or 4 sometimes. Have chords last 6 beats followed by 2. Have the first chords last 3 full measures. This can really help you get away from that square, one change every 4 beats kind of feel.  Second, think more in terms of lines rather than harmonies. Focus on the melody part, and the bass line. Come up with something that sounds good, and then just experiment to develop harmonies around them. This can lead you interesting places without getting you bogged down in what can become a somewhat artificial creation process."

(Root position then inverted triads, then sevenths, then secondary functions, then mode mixture and/or common chord modulations, etc...) I honestly think that four-part part writing and basic form are much harder than learning the uses of the augmented 6th chords. But there is a reason we learn four-part part writing first: it's integral to learning to handle the more exotic (but limited and therefore easier to learn) topics."

The exposition has theme group 1 in I, a transition, theme group 2 in V, then the closing. The development has whatever that is followed by the dominant retransition. The recap has the first theme group in I, the transition, theme group 2 in I, and then the closing. The squiggly lines are under the first transition, the development excluding the dominant retransition, and the second transition, and they're on the same line as the harmonies. That's your clue.   Because there's a chance this might be homework, I'm not going to spell it out, but I've given you all the information you need to draw a conclusion. You've got this."

If it's all triplet based, you'd use the value of one part of the triplet (an eighth note) as the lower number, and the number of beats x 3 as the upper number - that's called ""compound time"", where each beat divides into thirds.  So a measure of all triplets in 4/4 can be written as a measure of 12/8.  The triplets are still beamed in groups of three, but you don't need the little ""3""s over them."

musictheory,39qaum,sbarrettmusic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"Even in this video he notates the groove in 7/4 with a triplet subdivision. It's important not to confuse the BEAT with the SUBDIVISION. The beat is the pulse of the song, and this is usually a quarter note (4/4) or sometimes an eighth note (6/8). The subdivision is how the beat is divided. It can be eighth notes, sixteenth notes, or triplets for example and each subdivision will have a different feel. This is why you would never have a 2/3 time signature or something similar: because you can't have a triplet pulse."

The drums are doing something else, but it lines up with the 4/4.  So... still 4/4.  I don't hear any 14-note triplet pattern.  There is no reason why you'd want to write music in 8/3 (that's REALLY long -- two and two thirds whole notes) unless it's one measure with a weird time.  Some composers actually do this (I have to say, I've been tempted).  But in any case, this music is in 4/4, or maybe 12/8 if you want to write it that way.  By the way, are you aware that just playing eight triplets doesn't mean you're in 8/whatever (these are quarter note triplets, so 8/12 -- a quarter note is 1/4 of a whole note, and a triplet is a third of that, so 1/12, and there are 8 of them, so 8/12)?  In particular, it doesn't count if there are rests in there, or the notes aren't all equal in size.

I think what's happening here is that the chords (Cm-Bb-AbM7) are so heavily embellished/developed that they're not really ""harmony"" in a musical/theoretical sense.

I'm pretty much self-taught, practice-based, and I have a long way to go yet, so take this with a grain of salt. Also, these are just general guidelines, not rules. Break them as you see fit.   Change up the instruments and melody. Write songs in which if someone hears 5 seconds, they can tell where in the song they are (one exact spot, two at most). Listen to Ravel's Bolero. The basic musical idea is the same, but the song does not sound repetitive, because of changes in instrumentation, background music and melody. If you have a single musical idea (that you're not developing like in the example above), don't make the song longer than about 1.5 minutes. It's okay to make short songs! In a ~3 minutes long song, you normally need at least 3 or 4 musical ideas (or fewer if you can develop them). Make interesting drums and bass. Don't just play a single drum loop over and over, make various fills and change up the rhythm at least twice in a ~3 min song. With the bass line, be consistent, but introduce a healthy number of subtle changes and a small number of not-so-subtle changes. Interesting bass makes a lot of the song. Not staying in a single key helps against repetitiveness. Make an experiment / exercise in non-repetitiveness. Make a song (~2-3 mins) and do everything in your power not to repeat yourself. The song may sound like unorganized crap when you're making it; let it. When you're done, play it. Pick out three or four of the melodies/ideas you think sound the best and toss the rest. Base your song on these ideas.   I haven't composed anything worth while in some time, but I still hope this helps."
musictheory,39k0wy,slampisko,2,Fri Jun 12 12:08:03 2015 UTC,"One thing to add to this; one thing to make a melody or ostinato pattern sound new is to add a key change or rhythmic variation to it, which will give the song a feeling of being different while in reality still following the same idea you've been developing."
musictheory,39k0wy,Sihplak,2,Fri Jun 12 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"We know (from reading comments) repetition is generally good, although repetitiveness (or sounding monotonous) is bad, it's you're (fr4nci2c0's) problem. I think music tends to need both repetition and variation (not always).   I like how you (slampisko) talk about developing ideas, I personally prefer calling it variation; it implies better that you use the same idea with slight changes such as chord, key, register, instrument, a lot of these things have been mentioned in comments.  I'd also like to bring up Form, an element of music I've been studying a lot recently that I think plays a huge role here. It's normal for songs to grow in intensity to a climax as well as switching between ideas (as in verse/chorus form). If all the parts do a good job leading up to the climax they all seem like they fit well in the piece, and the variation will come as you increase the speed, volume, texture, etc. This is what I think makes Bolero so cool. Also verse/chorus form is just a nice form, I dunno if that's very helpful."

musictheory,39k0wy,KennySnyder,10,Mon Jun 15 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"My diss is on repetition in songwriting, might as well chime in..  Whatever you do, don't fall into the Adornian intellectual position that assumes repetition is infantile and primitive. We're well past that now. One of the things I found in my research is that only about 25% of the song contains what could be called ""new"" ideas, as opposed to repetition of those ideas (btw songs from Rolling Stone's 500 greatest). So roughly 75% is repetition of some kind. ""Classical"" music is less repetitive simply because it is a different style and notated, but there must be repetition for there to be coherence.  First thing I would do to improve your songwriting is to get out of your bubble, collaborate, don't be afraid to look like an idiot. Oh, and write more songs. You can't write two songs and then compare yourself to famous songwriters, because you won't write a third.   If you'd like for me to listen and give you feedback send me a pm."
musictheory,39k0wy,sickbeetz,4,Fri Jun 12 15:04:17 2015 UTC,"so the whole idea of writing music that is interesting to the listeners involves two things.    1) bring the listener in. something where the listener understands what is going on, easy to digest and makes it clear where they are in the song (ie starting a 16 measure section with a crash cymbal)  2) introducing a surprising twist or turn, do something unexpected to take the listener out of the comfort zone you have created.  it can be a little run at the end of 16 measures or go to double time, etc. anything really.  just try to catch them off guard.   beyond that, try doing some stuff like ""Catch & release"" where you build up the tension and then resolve it."
musictheory,39k0wy,differentclass,6,Fri Jun 12 15:44:02 2015 UTC,"Don't over think: if you know a phrase is repeating you can choose not repeating it just by shifting one rhythm or changing one note.

Even if you hate the Beach Boys, Good Vibrations is pretty much a class in variation within the traditional song format. Other ideas you may be already using, but that work for me:  Evolve your progressions, in a 16 bar verse say, change something every 4 bars. Could be swapping chords or switching from hi-hat to ride cymbal or a different bass drum pattern. Listen to the changes and modify your vocal melody accordingly.  Get a drum program with a wide selction of modifiable midi loops. Addictive Drums is great for that.  Change keys or change from a major chord dominant progreesion to a minor chord dominant progression when going to a new verse, bridge or chorus.   Middle 8ths, or 10s or 12s.  Add new instruments as the song progresses."

musictheory,39k0wy,xiipaoc,3,Fri Jun 12 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"Repetition is totally OK.  A lot of very popular bands have performed really repetitive music and at least some people like them a lot (not saying I like them).  That said, there's such a thing as too much repetition.  For example, maybe your first line goes C D E C F E D C.  Your second line -- repeat it!  C D E C F E D C.  But if you repeat it exactly at the third line, that's too much, so repeat it almost exactly: F G A F Bb A G F.  You can repeat your original line now: C D E C F E D C.  But now you're not at a good place harmonically, so let's add a line 5 that's mostly different but still keeps the same rhythm: D G F E D C B G.  For line 6, let's wrap it up with something similar: B C D G F E C.  That's a really simple 12-bar blues.  Almost everything is repeated, but not exactly repeated.  And this simple 12-bar blues can be repeated exactly, with new lyrics.  I recommend that you study Bach fugues from the Well-Tempered Clavier (by learning to play piano if you have to).  Get a sense for how repetition works in these fugues, then apply those concepts to your own music.  You don't need to deal too much with the counterpoint if that's not the style you're going for, but these fugues can really epitomize the kind of variation you want."
musictheory,39k0wy,Doctornamtab,3,Fri Jun 12 16:48:52 2015 UTC,Write the song first. When the inspiration is there y I lose it if I judge the song while I'm writing it. Then go back and rewrite the parts you think are repetitive. Change the rhythm or intensity. Experiment. Write a part with the complete opposite feeling of the others. Dont be afraid to write a bad first draft.
musictheory,39k0wy,PhilipK_Dick,3,Fri Jun 12 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"Something that has worked for me in the past is to give yourself parameters for writing.  Ex:  Write a melody on the b-string.  Write a melody only in 10th position.  Write only the rhythm to a song in ababca structure.  Sometimes by narrowing your focus, you can hear new things."

musictheory,39k0wy,Salemosophy,6,Fri Jun 12 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"This will probably get buried, but this is what I learned.   To write with more intentional variety, study works that do what you want to do, even if the ideas are vastly different to yours.  Spend more time with the smallest parts of your melody. Create variations of the motifs within a melody, then combine them in new ways to see what you get.  Look at the structure of a typical melodic statement and understand how that structure fits the type of music you want to write. A typical structure might be motif stated, motif repeats, new material is heard, and then the motif repeats again.    Here's a good exercise for learning about melodic development... Listen to and study the tune to Happy Birthday:   The first ""Happy Birthday to you"" begins with smaller intervals.  The second ""Happy Birthday to you"" has larger intervals.  The next ""Happy Birthday dear [So and So]"" has the largest interval of the tune - the octave leap - and the phrase ends with the name of the person being sung to while also traditionally ending up on the most dissonant chord of the tune.  The final ""Happy Birthday to you!"" is in a completely different key from what the rest of the tune seems to be setting up.  Get the tune and study the melody and the chords. For such a simple tune, there's quite a bit to learn about it.   Finally, repetition isn't a bad thing. It only becomes redundant when you don't properly pace for moments in your work. There might be great material in a song that you want to listen to over and over again, but the reason that material is special is because you only hear it so many times - everything builds up to that moment, so you have to learn what to repeat and how much. This is entirely up to your aesthetic as it relates to the style you're writing in.   When all else fails, go slower. Take more time with your ideas and really explore them endlessly. At some point, let your ear take over and let the aural stream of consciousness take you in the direction those ideas lead you."
musictheory,39k0wy,bFusion,2,Fri Jun 12 15:00:49 2015 UTC,"Just continue to write for yourself. What I found is that I just write for myself without caring if others will like it. Being sincere to yourself is important (unless you are trying to write songs for the masses, which is a whole 'nother ballgame). I think people can tell when you are being sincere and will like the songs even more. Look at Tom Waits, that guy has some crazy ass stuff and people flock to it. The more you write the more you will know what you like or don't. With that said don't be afraid to toss things aside. There are many ideas I had abandoned or just picked parts of things and saved them for later. I hope that makes sense."
musictheory,39k0wy,RBDtwisted,3,Fri Jun 12 07:53:39 2015 UTC,One thing I do to overcome this feeling is taking the direction of the song out of my hands.

Two things that drastically changed my life @ songwriting:   Truly learning, writing-out, and practicing the Harmonization of the Major Scale. Utilizing some device/system to record and edit your songs.   It sounds like you have the latter, so next is the unavoidable journey through expanding your harmonic horizons.  By understanding which chords are found on each of the tones in major scale, it will strengthen your understanding of chords and harmony in general.  Start with just C Major/A Minor (natural) and do not leave that until you truly have 'mastered' that major scale.  From understanding which tones get a major 7th chord, minor 7th, dominant chord, and dominant 7th/flatted fifth, to being able to play those chords in any place/position on the instrument you write on.  Learn each triad, inversion of each triad, etc.  So while you might just want to express yourself and let it all come out, if you don't know which ""words"" and ""phrases"" to communicate what you feel, you'll find yourself stuck behind an invisible wall.  Yes, it takes practice and can be repetitive, but make something fun out of it.  Write a song purely around the new chords you learned in the C Major/A Minor scale.  It might seem hokey at first, but it's like chipping away at marble to reveal the piece of art that was waiting there all along.  It's totally worth the work.  For recording your music, don't be afraid to ""throw away"" (i.e. move on) from a song.  At this stage, write and record as many as possible.  Each song you write, gets you closer to writing the song you want to write.  Your computer/DAW is a tool to help you chip away at that marble.  My two cents."

Know your limitations, work within those... pursue a like and a passion and get as good as you can get, if you're good you'll get better and people will desire what you have, but if American Idol has taught us anything it's that there are many people unaware of themselves out there in the world who won't even take a clue when those who have an abundance are freely giving them out."

A few things John said stand out to me in particular right now that I think could help you, OP.   The first thing he said is not to go for the simplest rhyme with your lyrics. Instead of rhyming ""ok"" and ""say"", rhyme two thicker words that will bring more meaning to the song. This way you'll have to think into your lyrics more, expand your vocabulary, and arrange your lines in more interesting ways.   The second thing is to not do what people expect you to do. If you think it would be expected to stick another chorus in at one point, switch it up and go into a solo instead or a bridge. Do things that'll surprise the listener. It'll cause you to think more about the music and make you add in parts to your song that you wouldn't normally.   Obviously, you don't have to stick to these rules 100% of the time because music isn't about that. But they're just good things to keep in mind when you're stuck."

It sounds like, more than anything, it's an argument about how we should define terms than it is about the actual music. The definitions of ""recapitulation,"" ""development,"" ""type 2,"" ""type 3,"" etc. Some people in the discussion seem to want to define the terms one way, others want to use a different definition of some of these terms. But that doesn't say anything about the music, that says something about the terms you are using.   Arguing about the precise boundaries of all these terms ignores what I think is one of Sonata Theory's central tenants: dialogic form.  The point of a Sonata Theory analysis is not to come up with ""the correct"" way to label a piece. Rather, the point is to figure out how the piece is interacting with other similar pieces, and how it realizes normative sonata procedures in a unique and interesting way.   In other words: I can see both perspectives being correct if you define your terms in a particular way. But so what? What does that tell us about the music?"
musictheory,39is3g,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"Terms are how we label elements of music, and without it we can't communicate. For example, being able to agree on what constitutes a major or minor chord is vital to analysis, and if two people disagree on this, discussion of the terms would be important.   More importantly, arguing over distinctions is not pointless. The question ""is this type two or type three?"" forces you to think about the overall structure of the piece. As a clearer example, the question 'What is a recapitulation?' makes you think about the nature of repeats. You realize there is a difference between simply repeating material and a entire recapitulation of a section. It's untrue that this kind of thinking ""doesn't say anything about the music."" You're thinking about what it means to be a recapitulation in music in general, and you can then apply that to the specific piece.    In context of sonata types, talking about the difference between a type 2 and 3 means you're thinking about what sonatas are to begin with.  So it's not pointless; it's subtle."
musictheory,39is3g,FloatyFloat,2,Sat Jun 13 01:27:05 2015 UTC,"I think the question ""is this a Type 2 or a Type 3 sonata"" is not an inherently useless question, since those are meaningful categories. But it can be a useless question and the categories can be stripped of their utility in certain conversations. My reservations are that I really think shoving difficult pieces into these categories is pretty against the spirit of the enterprise of sonata theory.   Hepokoski defines dialogic form in a very particular way: ""A processual dialogue between any individual work (or section thereof) and the charged network of generic norms guidelines, possibilities, expectations, and limits provided by the implied genre at hand... Form in dialogue with historically conditioned compositional options."" (Musical Form, Forms, and Formenlehre, 71-2).  He sharply distinguishes between this and what Mark Evan Bonds calls conformational form: ""form understood as conforming to a model (That is emphatically not the approach of Sonata Theory, which, with its interest in formal deformations, does not insist in any necessity to 'conform')"" (Ibid, 72).  My issue is that OP seems to be treating the sonata types like models that pieces must conform to. That the question ""is this x or y?"" is trying to force the music to conform to the system of sonata types. But that's just the thing: a piece doesn't have to be one or the other, a piece can conceivably be in dialogue with both, and with other forms as well.   This is what I mean by the argument being pointless: it's about how far we can stretch the concept of sonata types in order to agree on a label. The label has meaning as something that describes a background norm. But as a conformational category that something either is or is not, then it is an all but useless one (in discussing interesting pieces like this, that is, it can still be useful for describing pieces that do conform).   Consider Hepokoski's discussion of Beethoven's Egmont overture: ""The question is not: 'Is Egmont in sonata form?' - or 'Is the Egmont Overture a sonata?'. Those are the wrong questions, and posed so bluntly they can elicit only wrong or clumsy responses. The more rewarding, dialogical question is: 'Are we invited to use our knowledge of the broad range of sonata-form norms and guidelines to interpret what does happen in Egmont?'. The answer, obviously, is 'yes.'"" (Ibid, 75).  And that's my problem with the argument, it's asking the wrong questions.   There isn't one thing that defines a recapitulation. Not even the primary theme (P apace) appearing in the tonic. There aren't hard edges that we can clearly say ""yes, if it doesn't have this exact element, it is not a recapitulation."" Rather, there are fuzzy edges. There are a bundle of recapitulation features, and if enough are signalled to us, then we point to something and say ""Oh look, a recapitulation."" So I think OP's question is misplaced. He made a question about the category and how this piece conforms to those categories. The more interesting questions are things like the following: what features of a recapitulation are called forth here? What features are suppressed? Do any of the Type 2 sonata signals show their head here (such as one of the characteristic launching of a Type 2's developmental space)? What might it mean for a sonata to give us some of these signals but not others, what does this say about this piece's particular embodiment of sonata procedures and dialogue with other similar pieces?   All of these presuppose that we understand the core features of a Sonata. That we know how to deal with normative situations. If the piece sits on a fuzzy border, then let it sit there. It doesn't break our core, normative instances. But forcing it to fit one category or another can blind us to features that point elsewhere. It minimizes them, renders them unimportant. At the end of the day, categorizing a weird piece as emphatically on one category or another says nothing about the piece, it's an argument rather about the limits of terminology. And that's a much more boring conversation."

musictheory,39gpu9,cleevn,8,Thu Jun 11 16:38:39 2015 UTC,Expected a drawn out but informative essay on the nature of chord quality and inversion to be the top comment. Good answer here.
musictheory,39gpu9,wc_helmets,11,Fri Jun 12 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"ok you're probably asking something like  If I have a C major triad (C E G), do I make it into a C minor triad (C Eb G) by dropping the middle note (E) down 1 semitone (to Eb) or down 1 note in the major scale?  That last section is the confusing part. Not sure what scale you're talking about. If you're talking about any normal C minor scale. Dropping the Eb ""down 1 note in the C minor scale"" would give you a D. A chord made of the notes C D G is not a minor chord.  Also, the ""middle note"" is not always going to be a 3rd if you are inverting the chord. For example, if your C major triad is played as E G C, then moving the middle note down a half step (semitone) gives you E F# C, which is not a minor chord. The third in this case is the E; moving that down a half step would give you a minor chord (Eb G C).  I think the proper way  to answer this is something like... to make a major triad into a minor triad, move the 3rd down a half step"

musictheory,39gpu9,einsnail,3,Thu Jun 11 16:58:41 2015 UTC,"Don't fret too much over all of the specific terminology that comes with theory, it will all come to you in time.   However, a key for me as I was learning and working my way through my first few classes was to recognize and keep in mind the importance of understanding the different voices in a chord. Rather than referring to the note 'E' in a C major chord as the 'second note' it is better and more proper to refer to it as the third. As /u/frajen notes above, inversions of chords play quite a role in music theory analysis.  The sooner you are able to get a firm grasp on what a 3rd, 5th, 7th and so on is from a given root note, the sooner you will be able to more solidly understand the harmonic basis of music."
musictheory,39gpu9,vinjhup,2,Thu Jun 11 18:04:11 2015 UTC,Lower it a semitone like people have already said.

musictheory,39gpu9,Talking_Meat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"The standard Western major scale consists of 7 pitches. Upon each pitch a chord can be constructed with the other notes of the scale (in thirds). Therefore, each chord built this way has one default quality. In order to change a chord's default quality you would necessarily have to use pitches outside of the scale.  So, in C major, you have the following 7 default triads:  C E G  D F A  E G B  F A C  G B D  A C E  B D F  If you wanted to change C major to C minor, that would involve altering the E down a semi-tone to E-flat; thus C E-flat G. If, instead, you moved E down a step in the scale you would end up with C D G: not a minor triad."

musictheory,39gpu9,Osricthebastard,0,Fri Jun 12 02:45:40 2015 UTC,"Down one semitone. Now you're asking yourself, ""well how do I turn the C major chord into a C minor within the C major scale?""  Well you don't. You can ""borrow"" the C minor chord from another scale but that's an entirely different field of slightly more advanced music theory which you'll get in to some day, but not right now.  For now you need to understand that every scale has 7 unique notes and every note is the root of one of 7 unique chords. C major has the C major, D minor, E minor, F major, G major, A minor, and B diminished chords to call its own. Each note of these chords falls within the scale and that in fact helps determine whether or not the chord based on a particular root is going to be major, minor, or diminished. For example, the C major scale has to its name the notes C-E-G. All three notes fall in the C major scale. If it were a different scale you might have the notes C-Eb-G in the chord with C as it's root, which would make it a minor chord but ONLY because the scale you're using has an Eb in it to begin with. If the scale you're using doesn't contain an Eb, you can't (technically) make that C root chord a C minor.  Again though, there's borrowed chords. Lots of things you can do with that, but learn the basics before you start digging in to that. You have to know the rules to break them correctly. The one piece of advice I'll willingly give you in that direction is substitute the diminished 7 chord for a b7 major chord when at all possible. That means (for example) when using the C major scale, instead of using a B diminished chord on your 7th degree you might use a Bb (or A#) major chord instead. Why? Because the diminished chord sounds ugly and substituting with the b7 major sounds rather bright in comparison and STILL manages to pull your melody rather effectively in the direction of your tonic (root note). Just a neat little trick."

musictheory,39e1cq,uprightbaseball,16,Thu Jun 11 04:21:12 2015 UTC,"While I don't disagree that listening a lot is key I feel like I'm virtually the only person who isn't completely sold on the nearly cult-like push toward transcription as the bedrock of learning jazz.  To me it seems like it's a pedagogical method borne purely out of tradition and people chant it almost mindlessly because someone told them it's THE thing to do.  It's a lot like the Arban's book for trumpet players.  It's honestly not even that great of a book for many reasons, but the term ""trumpet player's Bible"" gets thrown around so much that everyone blindly recommends it to everyone asking for assistance without realizing that it's an absolute mess for beginners.  So I have a couple of major problems with transcription.  You learn what to play but not always why  It's a great way to get started with pure imitation, but experienced jazzers forget all of the other tools they have actually making this actionable.  Stealing or borrowing ideas that you can further embellish and noting the style and specific use of harmonic ideas by giants of the past is great, but it's not instructive if you don't have the basic jazz theory understanding to parse it and the technical mastery to do more than directly duplicate it.  You take the least efficient route to your destination  Transcription involves a lot of different skills.  Rhythm, theory, aural skills, etc.  All of these are even more complicated if you don't know what you're listening for.  Sure, if you understand I-V-iv-IV you can listen for it and transcribe it.  If you don't understand ii-V-I with a handful of extensions (like ii9-V13b9-I13#11) from a theory standpoint, you're not making a lot of progress.  Even for simple melody stuff that outlines those chords, if you don't understand what's happening, how much good does it do you.  Once again, you learn to replicate it exactly in one key, but don't understand its function to use everywhere else.  Personally, I'd say separate out and isolate the elements that go into transcription so that you can work on them efficiently and independently.  Go read some materials on jazz theory.  Find some software that lets you practice your aural skills, and then buy a transcription book of someone's solos.  There's honestly no reason to reinvent the wheel, especially if you're starting with the tools necessary to even do the job.   With those skills worked on separately, you can look at the professionally done transcriptions and parse why John Coltrane did that thing he did because you have the theory background.  You'll have the aural skills to pre-hear ideas you want to play and understand where the go and put them to use.  I think the transcribe mantra is just a result of ""That's how it's always been done"" and that's almost always a red flag.  If it can be done better, then do it better.  We have so much more technology and resources and so many more avenues for study now.  There's no reason to ignore them just to do what has always been done."

But I know a lot of people that seem to have a great grasp of theory and even technical musicianship but couldn't physically improvise or play along with a group w/out sheet music   I think that's most of them sadly (myself included once upon a time).  I think it's just a result of the current approach we have in so much of music education.  So many people have all of the tools, but just can't get free of the mental shackles of playing a ""wrong"" note or simply just doing anything spontaneously.  It's an all dressed up and no place to go situation."
musictheory,39e1cq,Yeargdribble,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:30:20 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd say separate out and isolate the elements that go into transcription so that you can work on them efficiently and independently.   I guess I always assumed that this was part of learning how to transcribe something. I definitely took a peek at a lot of solo transcriptions while starting out.  The first jazz tune I tried to entirely transcribe was Cannonball Adderley ""Autumn Leaves"" (version w/Miles Davis) and I spent forever on Cannonball's solo. There were some altered/diminished scale runs with chromatic splashes everywhere, and at the time I was perplexed to find something like ""Eb-Db-C-B-Bb-Ab-Gb-G"" in the melody. Playing it slowly, it sounded wrong to me, but fine in the recording.  I guess you could say, I learned the physical mechanics of how to play it without knowing why. After playing it hundreds of times, it was like muscle memory for me. I could sing it in my head and play along with it.  However, to go full circle with what you posted. From that kind of transcribing effort, I gained an interest in figuring out ""why the heck would anyone play that over a D7 harmony going into Gm"" - and for a while I'd say I understood the theoretical side better than being able to transcribe.  But even with knowing the theory, I still needed that muscle memory. The actual practicing of listening to something, figuring out what it is on my piano, and then mechanically playing it. Then, 12 key transposing. All for the sake of getting music into my subconscious, so when I heard it in my head, I could play it without thinking. Once I'm not thinking about how to play something, I can start toying around with it.  I suppose it's like why I learned scales and practiced voicing ii-V-I's forever and ever... at the time, it seems pointless/not functional, but it helps  well, to be fair I haven't taught improvisation lessons in any serious setting, ever (e.g. gotten paid $ for it). It might not be the best way to teach but it worked for me, that's all I can really say"

Cmaj7 and Dm both come from A minor instead of A major. This is actually a super common and effective way to use chromatic notes.   In Roman numerals, it'd be I7–♭III7–IV7–iv."
musictheory,39fnh9,m3g0wnz,5,Thu Jun 11 12:41:48 2015 UTC,"Wait, doesn't I7 mean dominant?  Shouldn't it be Imaj7, etc?"
musictheory,39fnh9,adelaarvaren,2,Thu Jun 11 18:36:55 2015 UTC,I was wondering this as well.
musictheory,39fnh9,MpegEVIL,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:18:22 2015 UTC,In classical RNs it's always diatonic unless otherwise specified. Jazz RNs may be different.

musictheory,39fnh9,adelaarvaren,2,Fri Jun 12 00:27:48 2015 UTC,"So by ""diatonic"" I just mean ""in the key."" I7 means major 7, ii7 means minor 7, iii7 is minor 7, IV7 is major 7, V7 is dominant 7, vi7 is minor 7, and viiø7 is half-dim 7 because that's what the notes of the key make. You see what I'm saying? The quality of the 7th isn't always specified; you're supposed to know what it should be without having to specify."
musictheory,39fnh9,m3g0wnz,2,Fri Jun 12 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you!   So why no distinction when you wrote out bIII7 for example?  If III is normally Phrygian, and it is minor 7, but in this example it is major 7 (i.e. both a major 3rd, thus the capital III, and a major, i.e. non-dominant 7).   Like, if I were to see your bIII7, how do I know that it isn't dominant?"
musictheory,39fnh9,adelaarvaren,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:14:38 2015 UTC,"In classical ♭III is borrowed from the parallel minor mode, so you'd just think of it in the same way as above, but the key would be A minor. In A minor, the III7 is C-E-G-B, a maj7. So ♭III is maj7 too."

Because the major seventh chords have the same notes, you can move from any major seventh chord to any other major seventh chord. It originates in early 20th century classical music. Also, the Dmaj7 to Dm is a IV-iv cliche that you hear pretty often in popular music."
musictheory,39esr2,Solidplasmus,4,Thu Jun 11 06:27:54 2015 UTC,"Could be an interesting niche. Other than just making another rhythm game the big problem I could see you running into is finding a balance between the strict rules of a game, wrong/right win/lose and the loose rules or common practices of music. You probably don't want to make a game that relies on much prior knowledge. I'd encourage you to make something that rewards experimentation. Don't spell out the rules of playing over a blues progression, if a player just randomly noodles around the major scale, the score should be average though not technically wrong. You could have difficulty levels that highlight the changes on the keyboard, giving the player options. This idea has me really thinking.  it would probably be much easier to make a game based around already completed pieces of music rather than generated music."
musictheory,39esr2,Leodhas,2,Thu Jun 11 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that experimentation would be key to this game.

musictheory,39esr2,skweezebox,2,Sun Jun 14 17:17:12 2015 UTC,"One idea can be to constrain the available notes and rhythms. For example, by just using notes in a pentatonic scale, played as a triplet rhythm. The constraints would allow you to ensure that whatever the players produce would have a somewhat pleasant sound.  That's just one idea. I'm sure there are lots of others.  Btw, make sure you check out the 'RhythmHeaven' series of games. They are great examples of rhythm games.  Good luck!"

musictheory,39d64f,elyisgreat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:30:04 2015 UTC,What's the difference between this and transposition? Is the latter a fixed constant across the board and the former something that happens inside a song?
musictheory,39d64f,LittleOmid,4,Thu Jun 11 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"Transposition is when you change the whole chart to a different key. Key change is when a song changes key and stays in the new key for a good long time, usually with key signature change. Modulation is when you use chords that are not in the key or cadences that are in a different key, but you somehow get back to the original key. Most of Jazz songs have modulations in them."
musictheory,39acs9,GrysonOC,12,Wed Jun 10 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"One doesn't normally notate a polyrhythm as two time-signatures (that would be a polymeter - and could entail any note-values), usually it's described as a ratio. In a 5:4 ratio, five notes are equally spaced across the same time that four notes are."
musictheory,39acs9,MiskyWilkshake,6,Wed Jun 10 12:23:56 2015 UTC,"If the fifth sixteenth note falls on beat 2 this would be a cross rhythm. You are subdividing the 4/4 beat in four sixteenths but grouping in five sixteenths.  http://www.classicalguitar.org/images/poly-rhythms-3.png  The top represents the 5/16 pulse, the bottom represents the 4/4 pulse.  On the other hand, if the five sixteenth notes are evenly spaced between each beat you are simply subdividing in sixteenth note quintuplets. A polyrhythm would only be created here if another instrument part is subdividing the beat differently.  http://media.onlinedrummer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/anika-nilles.png  The two parts in this example do not create a polyrhythm. The snare drum is subdividing in sixteenth quintuplets but the bass drum is only playing the quarter note beat. To create polyrhythm the bass drum would need to be playing some other division of the beat."
musictheory,39acs9,thesego_211,7,Wed Jun 10 12:46:52 2015 UTC,"First thing, you're describing polymeter, not polyrhythm.  Polymeter is when you play one time signature (or ""phrase"" a time signature, in a sense) over another time signature. For instance, if I play in 5/16  C E G E G as an ostinato pattern, and then play in 4/4 quarter notes as C G E G as an ostinato pattern, I'd be playing a polyrhythm of 5/16 over 4/4.  Now, a polyrhythm is different. The simplest way I use to describe polyrhythms is:  Take one number of notes, lets take 4 for an easy example, and have your time signature be that (4/4). Now take a different number, 3 to keep it simple. In the 4/4 bar, you'll have 4 quarter notes, but at the same time you'll have a triplet that lasts the entire bar, so you're playing 4 evenly spaced notes on top of 3 evenly spaced notes in the same measure, and they both start at the same time at the beginning of each measure.  Polyrhythms are noted as something like 5:4, usually a ratio. You can break these down in a 2 easy ways:   If the smaller number is easy to sub-divide (2, 3, 4, maybe 6, etc.) then you can set the larger number as a time signature. In the case of 5:4, you have 5/4, and sub-divide in 16th notes. Then, once every 5 sixteenth notes, you will play one note or beat, and this will become the polyrhythmic pulse. If you have a music notation program that can do tuplets (I use musescore for this), then you can set one voicing to a tuplet lasting the entire measure, and then have a quarter note pulse above if, it you want something like 7:5 for example.   Counting this (bold for quarter-note pulse in 5/4, itallic for the four-tuplet/quarter-tuplet/beat every 5 sixteenth notes) would look like this using 1-e-and-a counting for sixteenth notes:  1 (e and a) 2 e (and a) 3 (e) and (a) 4 (e and) a 5 (e and a) 1"

musictheory,39acs9,shiner_man,2,Fri Jun 12 13:59:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that'd be one example.  Another great example of Polymeter and a very easy one to spot is the song ""In Limbo"" by Radiohead (from the Kid A Album) where the drums are all in 4/4 while the rest of the band (most notably guitar(s)) are in 6/4 until choruses such as at 0:32 into the song/video."

Basically I wanna know if the 2 of the 4/4 falls on the 5 of the 5/8 time, or if the 5 eighth notes get equally spaced in between the 1 and 2 of the 4/4 (if that makes sense to anyone)?"
musictheory,39acs9,bstix,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:57:40 2015 UTC,"No, the 2 of the 4/4 wouldn't fall on any of the 5/8 beats.  If you play 4/4 and 5/8 on top of each other within the same time. (I.E. the bar is equally long in time for both signatures), only the first beat would align.   Reading your post has led me to believe that you intend to play 4/4 and 5/8 in tempi that would make one bar of 5/8 half as long as one bar of 4/4. Then the beats would only align on 1 and 3 of the 4/4 which are the 1st beats of both 5/8 bars.  Try drawing a grid with 20 columns and 2 rows and put the beats into that, so the beats of each rhythm is equally spaced. Each beat of the 4/4 would take 5 spaces and each beat of 5/8 would take 2 spaces. That way you can visualize where the beats fall.  TL;DR: Just did it for you: http://imgur.com/HZlHhaT"

musictheory,399lx7,mazegeek999,9,Wed Jun 10 06:26:05 2015 UTC,"This is kinda a funky one, and not at all uncommon. The II7->VI thing is something you see a lot in popular music from rock to bluegrass.   I think the main reason it works is the chromatic motion that's either in the voice leading or implied in the harmony. . In your E->F#7->A->E example, you have a B resolving to an A# resolving to an A resolving to a G#. Now of course depending how you voice the chords this could be obscured, but I think the ear still gets a sense of it. I'm most sold on this theory because playing that progression with a pedal E in the bass doesn't too hugely change the strength of the progression, to my ear.   It also strikes me that F#7 and A are actually very similar chords. Take the F#7 chord, flat its 3rd and put it in first inversion and it's practically an A chord.   PS I love these questions that actually force me to sit down at the piano and use my ears.   Edit:  I wouldn't call this a secondary dominant personally, because as you've noted it isn't followed by the dominant. And to my ear when we reach that II7 chord, I don't really feel pulled to the dominant necessarily."
musictheory,399lx7,ethanjhayward,2,Wed Jun 10 07:08:08 2015 UTC,"Great points! I think that chromatic motion is largely what lets it flow as well now that I think about it.  I think it's also true that the chords are similar. It's like an A6 chord but the root is up a half step. Cool way to think about it. And I guess the F#7 chord isn't THAT odd, as it has only one accidental, which happens to be the next accidental in the order of sharps, so it is closely related.  And yeah, I think there would need to be more context to initially hear a pull to the V from the II7. Especially if you stress the tonic as, in my example, E and not B, it shouldn't feel too much of a pull."
musictheory,399lx7,ethanjhayward,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:19:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Good point about that A# being next in the order of sharps.  Playing through this progression a few times, I think it works because the F#7 is a pleasant surprise to the ear, pleasant because it's not too remote-sounding (for ther reason you mentioned), and the chromatic motion helps it resolve in a satisfying way."
musictheory,399lx7,nhmo,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:23:46 2015 UTC,Do you know that progression you have up in your post is the exact chord progression of our sub's most infamous post? There's actually some discussion about its usage there.
musictheory,399lx7,museman,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"The reason why chord progressions ""work"" is usually voice leading. If each note has a place to go, it will probably sound smooth. II -> IV (the Forget You progression) works great because the root of II goes down a whole step, third goes down a half step, and fifth stays put.  One thing that always strikes me is when II goes to I. Ben Folds does it all the time. II is such a dominant sounding chord, but going straight to I works pretty well - perhaps for the same voice leading reason."
musictheory,399lx7,MiskyWilkshake,10,Wed Jun 10 14:27:32 2015 UTC,II7 is usually actually V7/V. It's a secondary dominant.
musictheory,399lx7,nonotan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"Right, I should have mentioned that in my post. One of my other confusions is that, although it can be called a secondary dominant, it doesn't function as one in this context. It is going to IV instead of V."
musictheory,399lx7,MiskyWilkshake,2,Wed Jun 10 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"I II IV I and variations are really common in popular music. Personally, I interpret it as modal interchange. You can think of it as Lydian II going into the parallel major's IV.   It's more or less equivalent to the probably even more common Dorian/Aeolian modal interchange involving Dorian IV and Aeolian VI (which is IV in the relative major -- meaning you are ""sort of"" moving from IV to another IV while keeping the root the same, which keeps the ear interested while sounding smooth)"
musictheory,399lx7,felpach,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:09:43 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... Then I guess it's just a chromatic alteration. If it's a 7b5 chord, it could be an inverted Fr+6? Alternatively, if it went to vi, I would have called it a IV/vi (borrowing from the melodic minor). Can we see the music?"
musictheory,399lx7,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:23:52 2015 UTC,"You're overthinking it. It's simply a II major chord, burrowed from the relative Lydian mode. Extremely common chord. Usually in music, the answer is 10 times simpler than how it sounds."
musictheory,399lx7,barisaxo,3,Wed Jun 10 11:53:02 2015 UTC,The question was how and why it functions.
musictheory,399lx7,colorized,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:20:05 2015 UTC,"ANSWER  It functions as tension. The tension in a dominant chord is with the tritone, which lies in the 3rd and 7th chord tones of said dominant chord.   You have F#7 which has the tritone A#-E, which is resolving to A-E, only half the tritone has moved in the resolution, such that it is called a secondary dominant chord.  EXPLANATION  A tritones favorite way to resolve is by half step in opposing directions. For example, in the key of C; G7 has the tritone B-F that like to resolve to C-E.  Also please note that term 'secondary' refers to a group of dominants that don't resolve perfectly, not only specifically V of V. There are a lot of ways for a tritone to resolve, only one is the strongest, the rest are secondary. Why do they work? Because they sound good.  Among many many other ways there are to explain it, which are technically correct. The theory doesn't matter so much as the application, there are a lot of ways to describe the same thing.   This is the way I like to think of it. Follow the tritone"
musictheory,399lx7,jason_stanfield,3,Thu Jun 11 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of things that sound good don't really have satisfying answers as to ""why"" they sound good, but I have a couple of thoughts to add: The feeling I get from the IV in this progression is very similar to that of a bVII in an otherwise diatonic progression. With the V7/V you've introduced a sharp 4th degree, taking us slightly away from the safety of our diatonic scale, but it is immediately neutralized by the IV chord which comfortingly re-orients us back to where we want to be. A bVII chord would do a similar thing to the (perhaps implied) 7th scale degree. Also, this kind of goes back to at least Mozart in the Marriage of Figaro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=ikQNFqVkNNc#t=52  At 52 seconds he does something very similar, though the root of the V7/V is missing and it's inverted. But the harmonic effect is, to me, almost identical."
musictheory,399lx7,Fluffikini,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:34:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a great example of the type of progression I'm talking about.   And I think you're right. I like the idea of how you immediately go back into familiar territory when you reach the IV chord. Doesn't make the II7 as odd as it might initially seem.
musictheory,398p9l,SocialIssuesAhoy,20,Wed Jun 10 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"In Jazz, the ii - V - I is actually regarded as more fundamental than IV - V - I, so IV would actually be a substitute for ii as a predominant.  I think this makes more sense in many ways since ii - V - I works due to the fifth motion that you mentioned, and really is essentially the diatonicized form of the true tonic-dominant relationship of V/V - V - I.  Therefore, I've always thought that when IV functions as a predominant, it is kind of substituting for ii because of early classical music's biases against chromaticism and the minor mode and preference for using major chords. V/V is a bit too chromatic with scale degree #4, so we need ii, but ii is minor so we can happily replace it with the only diatonic major chord that shares two pitches with it that will retain a lot of the core functionality.   So I don't think IV intrinsically leads to V on its own (any more so than bVII leads to I, which it does, at least in Jazz), but IV has inherited that property through tradition due to its close affiliation with ii, and it thus becomes the central predominant in classical music due to its special place as one of the three diatonic major triads (and the only one that is not tonic or dominant)."
musictheory,398p9l,Rockies17,4,Wed Jun 10 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"early classical music's biases against chromaticism and the minor mode   Biases agains the minor mode? What was that about, and how early are we talking?"
musictheory,398p9l,Bromskloss,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"I'm obviously not claiming pervasive biases against minor, but in the 17th and 18th century, major triads were often regarded as more stable and consonant (hence the phenomenon of the Picardy Third). Obviously minor ii occurs all the time in classical music, so the effect we are talking about is slight, but I would argue that it can help explain why IV became the first-level default predominant a bit more than ii."
musictheory,398p9l,Rockies17,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"The minor mode as a tonal area was much more rare in the eighteenth century than the major mode, you are right about that. (And, incidentally, the minor mode was also gendered female!)   But I don't think that this has anything to do with ii. In fact, I don't think that IV is any more statistically prominent as a predominant than is ii in this music.   Let's look, for instance, at the standard way to fill out the octave in the eighteenth century universe: The Rule of the Octave. This told a figured bass player ""if you see this scale degree in a passage focusing on stepwise motion, you play these figures.""   Insanguine writes, ""[when scale degree] 4 [ascends by step to 5, it] takes the 3rd, 5th, and 6th."" This means that the standard way to go from 4 to 5 is to realize 4 as a ii6/5 chord. Because 6/5 represented a dissonant chord that must ascend by step (7 was also figured with 6/5 when it ascended). A root position, consonant chord didn't have any inherent direction, so it doesn't project a move as strongly to 5. Or so it was in this system.   The Rule of the Octave is actually quite fascinating, a quick overview may be found here. It's a great way to think about scale degree stability and tendency and how chords form from that.   So I would say that even in the 18th century, ii was still conceptually the predominant. Though IV often does occur."
musictheory,398p9l,nmitchell076,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:50:45 2015 UTC,"You're the first one to actually offer any insight, thank you :).  That occurred to me - that in Jazz it wouldn't even be considered the standard. In fact, as you point out, ii - V - I makes a lot more sense logically, although I think for a different reason than you said. Whether you use ii or IV, within the root movement of the progression you still have an upwards M2 movement. Conceptually though, if it happens at the start it makes sense to me because tonic is your resting point. You choose to leap off of it, stepping into a chain of events which eventually leads you back home. So you can choose where to begin and it doesn't need to have some harmonic ""pull"". With the IV - V - I though it starts off logically (P5 down, great!) and then has to do a little jog halfway through to keep it on track.  Are you hypothesizing though that historically ii was the main predominant chord and then IV came along later as a logical alternative and usurped it? I feel like I'm still looking for deeper insight (and maybe actual information) on this. Even if there is no physical phenomena drawing our ears from IV to V, I'd accept a historical explanation."

There may be some truth to this, especially if you argue that ii65 was the historical precedent and that both ii and IV triads work by removing notes from the original seventh chord.  However, I want to caution you against believing any ""physical"" explanations for chord progressions. There's really nothing physical or acoustic motivating V I, either. V I is also a historic convention first & foremost: it developed as a good way of harmonizing B->C and D->C with a third voice. Root motion is a way of summarizing what's going on, but it is not a physical explanation."
musictheory,398p9l,vornska,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:10:26 2015 UTC,"I certainly won't say outright that you can't be right.... but that would fly in the fact of a lot of things I'm pretty sure I know. I can play one interval (perfect fifth) for any of my students, without having explained anything to them beforehand, and they consistently hear the resolution to the lower of the two pitches. I can then do the same with the leading tone, especially when paired with 4. Similarly, I can demonstrate how other note movements don't feel resolved and restful.  I explain all of this with the overtone series and the general concept that all energy and matter wants to find a more restful (lower energy) state."
musictheory,398p9l,frajen,2,Wed Jun 10 14:21:35 2015 UTC,Yeah but can you prove that's the reason or are you just telling a sciency-sounding story? All of your students grew up in a culture that trains them to hear certain sorts of musical connections. How do you know that those expectations aren't the product of learning?  I'm not saying we lack an experience of musical tension or tendency. I'm saying that the direct connection to the overtone series is not established.
musictheory,398p9l,nmitchell076,2,Wed Jun 10 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a scientist and my education hasn't progressed enough to have officially learned any of this. But, for example.... Isn't our major scale built on stacking perfect fifths from a tonic? Other than the subdominant which you go down a perfect fifth to get. And isn't the idea that it creates a cascade of resolutions TO tonic?"
musictheory,398p9l,Rockies17,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"After listening to jazz and blues for years, I find IV7-I and bIImaj7-I to be very comforting : )  I guess it depends on how you want to teach. While I think it's relevant to learn how 12-tone equal temperament works from a physics (frequency relationship) point of view, it might be worthwhile to point out other tuning systems.  With piano it's a little bit more ""enforced"" because most pianists I know don't tune their own instruments. Especially nowadays where a lot of people are probably learning how to play piano on electronic keyboards. But I think if you play guitar the idea of ""de-tuning"" notes comes naturally.  I remember being introduced to gamelan and prepared piano when I was in my late teens; it was eye-opening"
musictheory,398p9l,PygmyTwylyte,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"To your first point, yes. Stacking fifths is important to creating our scales. But to your second point, no. This did not create a cascade around the tonic. Or at least, that isn't historically how the tonic dominant relationship arose. This is especially true considering the fact that the V-I relationship arose out of the modal system in the Renaissance (more on this below). In fact, that explanation is offered up by Charles Rosen in his Classical Style and I believe it was a somewhat novel idea when he did it (though I don't know the full history of that and could be wrong).   Historically, however, the tonic dominant relationship began with the ""Clausula Vera."" This was a two-voice cadence that moved 2-1 in one voice and 7-1 in another (often there was a suspension preceding the 7). This was the way to cadence in two voices and had nothing to do with triadic harmony, but everything to do with scale degrees and their tendencies. So then people thought ""okay, how could I harmonize that in 3 or 4 voices?"" And it turned out the most convenient thing to do is to use scale degree 5, since that gives you a consonant triad in 3 voices and in 4 voices allows a common tone to be held. That's how V I came to be: the harmonization of a 2-voice counterpoint cadence.  Claims that there is some fundamental ""reason"" why V-I is ""natural"" can be nice and valuable in some respects. But they don't really represent historical reality about how that progression started to become so integral to western music."
musictheory,398p9l,ZoomBlah,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:01:03 2015 UTC,"Glad I could offer some insight!  I'm certainly not claiming a definitive historical perspective, nor would I think it could ever be so clear-cut that we can find some point in history where ""IV usurped ii,"" but my main point was that if you accept V - I logic, you can accept V/V - V - I and then if you have a preference for diatonicism and the use of major triads as stable foundational building blocks (both preferences were definitely true historically when the concept of ""tonality"" was established), that can lead one to understand how IV - V - I became ubiquitous and in particular why IV - V ""works"" in that context."
musictheory,398p9l,ser_marko,7,Wed Jun 10 05:37:25 2015 UTC,"I would say that IV doesn't lead to V, and that the ""tonal cycle"" can't be functionally motivated without also returning to I. I've always thought of I - IV - V - I as two ""clauses""; the opening I - IV, where we leave the comfort of the tonic and embark on a subdominant adventure, and the V - I, where we prepare our journey back to the tonic by first visiting the dominant. When you're at the IV, to my ears there is nothing that suggests that the next chord ""needs"" to be a V (in the way V ""needs"" to be followed by I). I - IV - I sounds just as natural to me, but by adding the V before the final I we add some extra tension on the way back, or a ""hint"" that we're heading back home. If we want to give an extra hint that we're heading from IV to V, sticking a ii or V/V in between will give us that (after these chords, V sounds more natural than I, like has been suggested).  One motivation of I - IV - V - I is that it visits all the notes of the key, using chord progressions that ""can be explained"" (I - IV and V - I), while also starting and ending on the tonic."

It does still bug me on a personal level though. In functional harmony, IV isn't just defined as the place we go to when we leave I... it's the cornerstone and front-man for the pre-dominant function. Emphasized because we basically define it by its position immediately prior to V."

An argument to do with concordance based on frequencies doesn't take into account the innumerable different tuning systems used historically where this progression has still been used. The most convincing arguments I've seen settle on historical precedent and social conditioning - whether it's harmonising I-IV-V or I-ii6-V or some variant, the Do-Fa-So bassline is not just common as part of baroque and classical writing, but stretches as far back as early polyphonic part-writing and as far forward as contemporary rock and pop. It's just a social institution now. And one of the best arguments for it being a social phenomenon rather than a physical one is in the study of other fields of music, where other arbitrary cadences are similarly satisfying within certain musical guidelines and languages but completely unsupported by physics or other aesthetic principles. For instance, bVII to I is a really common cadence in video game music, modal folk music, and pop and rock. bVI to I is a common cadence in a lot of Romantic works and again, early video game music especially. There's no classical explanation for this, they're just emergent systems, and they feel familiar and comfortable once you hear them enough!"
musictheory,398p9l,nygrd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"Never think about It, but maybe the easy answer is the correct: tension. When you go from IV to V is the same chord but one M2 up, this add tension to the chord you already hear. If you add that the V goes to I, you have a beatifull cadence.  Maybe not related, but going up a M2 is the most common thing in modulation, sounds very familiar and more powerfull. Example: Con te Partiro"

musictheory,398p9l,Bookwyrmle,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that individual notes in a scale have tendencies much like chords have tendencies.  The 6th note of a scale and the 1st note (the major 3rd and the 5th in the IV chord) both have a tendency to move to the 5th note of the scale (the root of the V chord).  If you do some research on tendency tones you can find more info, but I believe the general view is as follows: 1, 3, and 5 are considered stable tones.  The remaining tones in a scale are considered unstable and have a tendency to resolve to the nearest stable tone. In a major scale, 2 goes to 1, 4 goes to 3, 6 goes to 5, and 7 goes to 1.  All non-diatonic tones have a tendency to resolve to the nearest diatonic tone."
musictheory,398p9l,dadumk,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:37:11 2015 UTC,"From www2.siba.com, the website of Sibelius Academy in Helsinki:   Why is the subdominant a fourth degree in classical music and a second degree in jazz?  On the surface, this sometimes confusing difference seems like a matter of taste, but there is solid background for it. Theory teaching in classical music traditionally builds on triad harmony; the cadence IV - V - I is a prototype of the S-D-T phenomenon.  Jazz and popular music, however, are based on harmonies with four-note chords; there the corresponding cadence S-D-T is in the form II-V-I. What is essential here is the tonic included in the subdominant chord which moves to the leading note and back. Therefore, in triad harmony, the second degree, lacking this decisive note, is not suitable for a basic subdominant. In harmonies with four-note chords, either degree would do, but the second degree with a stronger tonic movement is more common (see above).   Hope that helps"
musictheory,398p9l,vornska,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:47:16 2015 UTC,I read in one of my basic theory books a couple years back that it is harmonically very easy to digest those sonorities in that order. A I - IV - V progression allows a listener to hear all of the notes in the diatonic collection. I don't know the history of the whole Tonic-dominant relation but it's probably due to the fact that one will hear all of the notes of the scale.

musictheory,398ike,Xenoceratops,4,Wed Jun 10 03:38:35 2015 UTC,"Speaking in terms of harmony, the ♭VI and ♭VII are borrowed from the natural minor. You can hear a ♭VI ♭VII i cadence in Rush- Subdivisions: From 0:37-0:51, and in the body of the song (first at 1:07). The strength of the line comes from its scalar progression. Really, this is the simplest way to harmonize the scale degrees ♭6 ♭7 1. We can understand the use of the ♭VI ♭VII I cadence in the major mode as mode mixture.  Check out how Nobuo Uematsu uses this progression in the Final Fantasy prelude. When we hit the IV at 0:25 and V at 0:30, it sounds like he could be setting up for IV V vi (♭VI ♭VII i in the relative minor). However, instead of getting the normal deceptive cadence to vi, he goes to the minor mode equivalent, ♭VI, at 0:36 and continues on to ♭VII  and I. Notice that there are major sevenths on both of those chords, so you get A♭∆ B♭∆ instead of A♭∆ B♭7, which would be consistent with the mode mixture (maintaining the A♭ for the seventh of B♭).  Edit: Some enterprising gentleman has transcribed this into MuseScore, if you want to take a look.

You need to work on diatonic function and relationship to the tonic for each pitch, and later for each group of notes. The key to this is sight singing and dictation exercises aimed at learning ""chunks"" of musical units such as scales, melodic chords of every variety, sequences, and further common melodic patterns.   The only way you will learn to read and sight sing music with facility is through some form of solfege, scale degree, or number system aimed at teaching function of pitches and larger pitch (i.e. scale and melodic) groupings.   Diatonic interval recognition is good for the first two notes. If you plan to spend hours developing this skill for the first few notes, or for post tonal repertoire then you'll be on your way, but otherwise I expect that you will achieve nothing meaningful in the music you are seeking to mentally comprehend."

If you can identify the key/scale then you should be able to pretty quickly play/transcribe the melody. Throw in familiarity with phrasing and ""common melodic patterns"" as /u/DimisnishedUnison said, and your intuition will be that much stronger."
musictheory,397eh9,fragproof,4,Wed Jun 10 01:10:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a bass player (upright and electric), and I figure out intervals most quickly by referencing them against the P4, P5, and P8 (which are all in quick reach on the next string or two up).  For example, the major third is one half-step below the perfect fourth (or in my head, over one string and down one note).  minor seventh is up two strings.  Inverted Perfect Fifth is down one string.    Second thing, know your enharmonics:  A2 = m3  A4 = d5  etc.  and your inversions:  inverted P5 = P4  inverted M6 = m3  inverted m2 = M7  etc.  and your P5's:  F -> C  B -> F#  D# -> A#  etc.  Lastly, play a quick scale of whatever key the piece is in before you start, I find it helps a lot."

musictheory,397eh9,punnierfuns,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:03:30 2015 UTC,"It seems most people are giving advice on identifying intervals aurally (and /U/DiminishedUnison is right on the mark, by the way, plus his/her username is AWESOME), but based on your question I'm assuming that you are talking about identifying written intervals.  You're right that counting steps is slow, and with enharmonics it's not always guaranteed to give you the right answer. The way I do it seems a bit convoluted at first, but as you practice you will get faster —MUCH faster — and it has the benefit of getting you the right answer every time.  The main requirement, however, if that you need to know your key signatures. But you need to know those anyway!  Here goes:  1 . Until I tell you, IGNORE ANY ACCIDENTALS. Proceed as if they aren't there.  2 . Count out the distance of the interval — second, third, fourth, etc. — by counting lines and spaces, counting the lowest note as ""one."" You'll soon recognize by shape: fifths have both notes on lines or on spaces, for example. This number will NOT CHANGE! No amount of accidentals can make a third stop being a third.  Still ignoring those accidentals? Good! Now it's time to analyze the interval you have without any accidentals. Three options:  3a. if it's a unison or octave. You're looking at a perfect interval (P1 or P8). Go to step 4!  3b. If it's a fourth or fifth, it's perfect... Unless the two notes are F and B. If they are, then its an A4 or a d5. Go to step 4!  3c. If it's a second, third, sixth or seventh, it's key signature time. Of the two notes involved, choose the one that has the easiest major key signature (if you have D and B, for example, I'd go with D, because D major has two sharps whole B major has five). Then ask one of these questions:  - Is the top note in the major key of the bottom note? (If so, the interval is major.) - Is the bottom note in the major key of the top note? (If so, the interval in minor.)  These two situations are mutually exclusive; one statement will be true and the other will be false. Onward!  4 . Okay NOW you can start uncovering accidentals. Add them back in one at a time and track how the interval changes. You have a minor third and you add a sharp to the top note? Now it's major. Of course there's little shortcuts: if C to A is a major sixth, then C# to A# is a major sixth also.  Again, I know that looks convoluted, but try it for a while, enough to memorize it. If it doesn't work, return it for a full refund!  EDIT: I typed this all on my phone (I'm SUPPOSED to be doing the dishes) and reddit borked my numbering. I'll fix it when I can open my laptop (i.e., after dishes)  EDIT 2: finished dishes and forgot about Reddit. Got lots of clothes folded, though, and watched The Almost People. Went to sleep frustrated by cliffhanger. Sorry! Numbering fixed now..."

Training your ear isn't an overnight thing, and it can take quite a while.  However, when first learning, using some common examples of intervals can help you. Keep in mind, this is only a crutch for when you're first learning to recognize intervals.   Minor 2nd: Jaws Theme Major 2nd: Happy Birthday or your average everyday major scale Minor 3rd: Brahms' Lullaby, Greensleeves, Minor arpeggio Major 3rd: First two notes of Kumbaya (a major triad) Perfect 4th: Here Comes the Bride, Amazing Grace, O Christmas Tree Tritone: The Simpsons theme, ""Maria"" from West Side Story Perfect 5th: Star Wars theme, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Minor 6th: Mozart's Lacrimosa Major 6th: My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean, NBC Theme Minor 7th: ""Somewhere"" from WSS Major 7th: No clue!

It's faint, but you can see the line of the staff in the center of the sharp - so it's for the F line. Also, as others have noted, there is a standard order of sharps (and flats). In modern music (and non-Western music) there are key signatures that don't follow that standard, however. But this rule for the center of the symbol being on the line or space to which it applies goes for accidentals on individual notes also, so it's handy to know."
musictheory,395oy1,NoApplauseNecessary,3,Tue Jun 9 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"Sharps and flats in the key signature apply to the whole piece. You'll notice that the sharp on the top line of the staff appears on every line of the music at the start. This sharp is on an F which means every F of the piece is now an F#.   Sharps and flats also have an order: F C G D A E B. This pattern is very important and is known as the ""Circle of Fifths"". Ascending, starting from C, it shows the number of sharps in each major scale, C having 0, G having 1, D having 2, etc. The order of the sharps themselves starts at F. The order of flats is the same but goes backwards from Bb, Eb, etc., to Fb. For minor scales, start at A minor but the order of sharps and flats stays the same. Sharps and flats are always in this order and there cannot be a key signature with sharps AND flats (until you get into modern classical music from composers like Bartók, Ligeti, and Cage). I recommend looking at J. S. Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier which explores all 24 scales and their key signatures."

musictheory,3973t4,cmparkerson,4,Tue Jun 9 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"jazz POV  ii-V-I  Dm7-G7-Cmaj7  The 13th (B) on the Dm7 is sometimes avoided, in my experience. However, a Dm13 played on its own can resonate quite well as a dark, moody chord.  G7 (13, which is an E) as you've noticed works quite well. If the melody note is the E, it can be held going into the C major, moved down to D for a Cmaj7 (9) (sounds like a bright, floating chord), or moved to C for a very resolute conclusion.  Cmaj7 (13, an A) also works. The 13th adds to what I called a ""floating"" characteristic earlier. Another thing, Cmaj7 (13) vs. C6:  Cmaj7 (13) = C G B E A  C6 = C G E A  The C6 is bit more sturdy in my ears but less airy. For the Cmaj7 though, you can throw in a 9th and #11 pretty easily too. A simple but illustrative thick voicing to play on a Cmaj7: C E G B D F# A  On b13's - a simple G7b13 to me implies melodic minor harmony (think 5th mode of melodic minor scale). In combination with other extensions it could be a whole bunch of things. Still functionally a V chord though as you pointed out. Another thing, a G7aug or G7#5 implies a whole tone scale for me, so even though b13 and #5 are both ""Eb"" in this case, I would treat them differently in an improv context"
musictheory,3973t4,frajen,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Ok. I'm a little drunk right now, but wouldn't the 5th mode of the melodic minor have the raised 13th? Shouldn't it be harmonic minor?  EDIT: ahh. yes. being drunk did affect my theory. nevermind. You're right."
musictheory,3973t4,aquamarine_tangerine,4,Wed Jun 10 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"What genre of music?  In common practice, if you get a 13 chord its likely.  In jazz, they are everywhere and over any kind of tetrachord (minor 7, Major 7, dom 7 etc).  They are elsewhere too.  For example, 13s are common in funk as the I chord.    b13's are a bit different, sense they are typically a half step above a chord tone.  They are often used as V chords in a minor key.  Sometimes they are written as augmented (G+7 resolving to Cmin), but if you treat it as a true b13 you retain the natural 5th and you get a nice added crunch.  It's just as fair to use it when resolving to major (modal interchange).  b13s also sound nice over Minor7(b5) chords (a.k.a. half diminished seventh chords) since that is a whole step above the 5th."

musictheory,398pee,mharray,4,Thu Jun 11 23:41:04 2015 UTC,"To add a bit more to other answers about why: It's a way to talk about chords without tying it to a specific key.  If all the music in the world were in C, we'd talk about C, Dm, G, an F-G7-C cadence, etc. If all the music in the world were in, say, E♭, then we'd just talk about E♭, Fm, B♭, an A♭-B♭7-E♭ cadence, etc. We wouldn't need to bother with numerals; we'd just have actual names for the chords.  But since there are multiple keys, we need a way to make sure that we know we're talking about the ""same"" chord in different keys, even if the actual letter of the chord is different because we're in different keys. So we say I, ii, V, a IV-V7-I cadence, etc., and it refers to the appropriate chords in every key. Then when we talk about how the ending of someone's Sonata in E♭ Major is kind of like a part of someone else's Violin Concerto in C Major, we're not constantly talking about how this A♭ chord is like that F chord, how this C is just like that A, etc. We can just talk about how this IV is like that IV and how this 6th scale degree is like that 6th scale degree."

To me, tenors and baritones are very difficult to distinguish in the middle range, but what sets them apart is their extensions. A baritone will have a very rich low extension below the low C, and the tenor will have a more intense, piercing extension above the high F, above the passaggio, whereas tenors will generally stay above the C and baritones below that F. If you have decent relative pitch, compare to your own voice. If you hear a voice sing a note that sounds low or high in their range, try and get an estimate for the note and judge from there.  As for women's voices compared to countertenors, I listen to the tone of the vibrato. It's harder to describe, my only advice is to listen."
musictheory,397tf8,GreenTambourine,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"Countertenor: usually quite a pure, delicate thin and reedy tone with little vibrato.  Listen to Andreas Scholl singing Dowland's Flow, my tears, for instance, or Alfred Deller singing the British folk songs The Three Ravens or The Oak and the Ash, or Iestyn Davies singing But who may abide from the Messiah.  I always feel there's a depth and richness that is hidden but strongly hinted at in the countertenor voice, almost like an echo of something big and powerful or an image seen 'through a glass darkly', whilst the female voice, including the contralto (aka alto), has a natural openness and clarity but no such hidden murky complexity (as an example compare the Iestyn Davies recording to this one of soprano Emma Kirkby or this one of alto Hillary Summers).  But these things are quite personal, and I'm sure many will disagree.  One thing to note is that countertenors will only rarely sing operatic repertoire more recent than roughly the 18th Century, so anything sounding like this contralto Wagner aria will only be a female alto.  As for tenor vs. baritone, the joke among choral singers is that a baritone is anyone who was left out when God handed out the high and low notes.  So distinguishing can indeed be quite hard.  Within the solo repertoire there is a baritone 'style', though, which singers are to some extent trained into -- a warm, rounded, rich sound exemplified by the glorious Fisher-Dieskau.  Tenors have a lighter, more ethereal, precarious tone -- compare tenor Peter Schreier's recording to Dieskau's (I've linked to the same Schubert lied for both) to get some idea.  Good luck for the exam -- don't worry about this question too much, it's unlikely to affect very many marks!  edit: skip to 1:27 in the Emma Kirkby video if you're not bothered about the recitative (though it's pretty good)."

musictheory,3973p8,Kickatthedarkness,2,Tue Jun 9 18:59:04 2015 UTC,"The song makes heavy use of the double harmonic scale through most of it. The chorus just starts heavily using the VI chord, based on the 6♭ from that scale. However, the natural chord there would be 6♭-1-3, that is, an augmented triad. Instead they just use a VI major (6♭-1-3♭), and what seems to be a i chord (1-3♭-5, instead of the I chord, 1-3-5, from the scale) to match the lowered 3. They are definitely singing 3♭ in the melody in the chorus, and a raised 3 elsewhere.  If the main scale were a regular old minor scale, a VI-i chorus would not be particularly unusual (the VI would be a IV in the relative major), so I think what they're doing is shifting from the double-harmonic to pretending it was plain minor.

musictheory,396y1r,EnterpriseNCC1701D,3,Tue Jun 9 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"Harmonic and melodic minor scales are constructed using a hammer and nails (I know /r/dadjokes is calling me).  It is good that you understand that the 6th scale degree or ""submediant"" provides the structure for the relative natural minor scale of that particular major scale (C Major --> A min).   Using A minor as an example, the structure for the nautral minor scale is...   A (W) - B (H) - C (W) - D (W) - E (H) - F (W) - G (W) - A  The harmonic contains a raised 7th, also know as the leading tone.  A (W) - B (H) - C (W) - D (W) - E (H) - F (W+H or +2nd) - G# (H) - A  The G# allows for dominant V E major chord or E7, as well as an implied dominant through a G#dim chord. G# provides a much stronger pull towards the tonic (in this case A) then does G natural.  The Melodic contains a raised 6th and 7th when ascending, and the natural 6th and 7th when descending.    A (W) - B (H) - C (W) - D (W) - E (W) - F# (W) - G# (H) - A   A (W) - G (W) - F (H) - E (W) - D (W) - C (H) - B (W) - A  Hope this helps! Best of luck in your musical pursuits."

musictheory,396y1r,aquamarine_tangerine,3,Tue Jun 9 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"Ok. There's an extra half step in your harmonic minor scale first off.  Second. With harmonic and melodic, it's better to not try and relate them back to any major key for a second.   The key of A harmonic minor has one sharp. G#. Melodic has two sharps. F# and G#.  The reasons the 6th and 7th scale degree were raised is because in natural minor the iv and v chord are minor. There is no leading tone to pull back to i, so there was no strong emotion, or cadence.  Scale degree 7 was raised to create the V7-i cadence in minor. Giving it a stronger resolution.  Scale degree 6 was raised to give you a major IV chord.  As far as I know, composers didn't like the sound of an augmented 2nd interval in their melodies. It just wasn't a hip sound to them. (Same with Tritones). That's why there's an ascending melodic minor and a descending melodic minor.  When you see melodies written in minor over a V7 chord, they didn't use the interval between 6 and raised 7. that's where melodic minor came in. That's why it's called melodic. To write a melody without having an aug 2nd in it.  Harmonic is harmonic to create stronger harmonies. Melodic is to create stronger melodies."
musictheory,396y1r,disaster_face,2,Tue Jun 9 23:09:14 2015 UTC,"the natural minor scale is a mode of the major scale, so it makes sense to think about it as starting from the 6th degree of the major scale.  The other forms of minor are not, though they do still have a special relationship with the major scale a minor third above (major 6th below) because they are components of its relative minor key.  A good way to think about the other minor scales is to compare them to natural minor.  So, harmonic minor is just natural minor with a raised 7th, and melodic minor is natural minor with a raised 6th and 7th.    The reason that it's good to think about them as one thing is because really that's what they are...  They are all elements of a minor key.  To understand how they work together, it's important to know some very basic harmony.  In a major key, the most important harmonic relationship is that between the dominant and the tonic.  That's the chords built off of the 5th scale degree and the 1st.  The dominant seventh chord (G7- [GBDF] in the key of C) is very unstable and desperately wants to resolve to the C major triad.  This is because the B (this is called the leading tone) really wants to resolve upwards to C, and the tritone between the B and F create an unstable chord.    In a minor key, if you just build a chord off of the 5th degree of the natural minor scale, it will be minor, not major/dominant.  It won't have the leading tone, it won't feel as unstable, and it won't create as satisfying a resolution.  Because of this, it became common practice to simply raise the 3rd of the chord (The 7th scale degree) during a V chord when in a minor key.  This is where the harmonic minor scale comes from.  This scale has an awkward interval between the 6th and 7th scale degrees-- an augmented 2nd (3 half steps).  Because of this, the 6th scale degree is often raised along with the 7th to avoid awkward melodies.  This is where the melodic minor scale comes from.  For this reason, it can be helpful to think of a minor key as having a lowered third and having the OPTION of a lowered 6th and/or 7th when comparing it to a major key."

To me a lot of it seemed fairly obvious, but then I realized that I've accumulated my knowledge of these concepts over years from various sources.

For a USA resident checking the currently conversion rate, that's $307.50.  Crazy steep in my opinion.  It seems to me like you could just buy a single module in a single key, transpose it yourself and use iReal Pro and get 90% of what it's covering considering how unnecessary it seems to write out scales and arpeggios in various forms for every single key in the book (though obviously, that's my experience bias talking... students seem to really need to look at it written out and often can't even conceive to try playing an exercise any key other than the one it's written in).  I certainly appreciate his attention to detail (especially on the multi-octave, multi-clef stuff), but it still seems a little out of hand from a price perspective.  I also have to say, all of the various a la carte purchase options are pretty difficult to parse.  I'd be slightly more curious to check out a small selection to know if it's something worth recommending to people if it was easier to do so.

musictheory,391bco,ignazio19,6,Mon Jun 8 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"The second theme does not have to bear any relationship at all to the opening material. In the classical sonata, it merely has to be in the same meter and in the dominant key. I think it is important to ask, however, how are the themes similar, if at all, and in what ways do they contrast? Do both have a similar shape, or do their shapes contrast (maybe one starts with an ascending line, the other starts with a descending one). Maybe the first theme sounds ""orchestral"" and the second more like a vocal melody. Maybe the first theme hits a lot of modally mixed road blocks on the way to its cadence, while the second theme articulates its cadence with relatively zero problems.  These are all ways of describing a relationship between two themes in a way that allows us to ask what they mean. To draw significance from the comparison, rather than saying ""motive A is present, therefore these themes are related, let's move on.""  Let's take an example. Say, this sonata by JC Bach (Here's a score)  The first theme (mm. 1-8) is a looping series of four measures, you have six big loud chords and then a little response, accompanied by a very uncomplicated harmonic context that keeps the home key tonic firmly in place.  It's also a very ""orchestral"" texture, this very clearly is not meant to be evoking a singer singing a melody. Everything is loud, bombastic, more about texture then melody, harmonically simple, and tonally unproblematic.  Contrast this with the second theme (mm. 19-34 downbeat). Here, we have what is clearly set up to be an 8-bar periodic vocal phrase, an antecedent goes from mm. 19-22 moving to a half cadence.  Mm. 23-26 should respond to this and produce a V:PAC.  Things go unproblematically through the beginning of m. 25, but there's a hitch, precisely at the point of the D# in m. 25 (imagine that measure having the bass line C# D E E | A to hear the PAC I say is meant to happen there).  This sets off a heavy expansion as the music tries to work its way back to the cadence that it should have already produced (notice that we ""abandon"" the bass register, and then the accompaniment altogether).  Then, we finally get set back on track with a move from D down to C# in the recaptured bass register, which initiates an emphatic cadential progression that sounds pretty ""triumphant,"" the music has overcome its own obstacles and reached its cadence.  So, the first theme and the second contrast in remarkable ways.  On the surface, the first theme is loud and the second theme is quiet.  The first theme is very ""chordal"" and suggests an orchestral texture, while the second is very vocal in quality.  The first theme also is firmly attached to tonic and dominant, almost strangling the tonic.  The second theme, on the other hand, cannot seem to lock itself down; it lets itself be pulled away from the 8-bar phrase into this fantasy-like expansion, before finally setting itself back on course and accomplishing its cadence after much effort.  These are differences, but they are differences that mean something.  That is, we can ask ourselves, ""what does it mean that the big loud orchestral stuff seems to have the tonic on lockdown, while the lyrical theme seems to have trouble keeping itself together?""  These differences have expressive implications that we can uncover or explore.  To me, the question is not ""how are the two themes related or not?"" but rather, ""what do the connections or lack of connections mean for my experience of the work?""  The important thing is to train yourself at recognizing these similarities and differences, and, to go further, to be able to interpret them and make musical and/or expressive sense of them.  As for resources on Sonata Form, I think the most suggestive is Hepokoski and Darcy's Elements of Sonata Theory. The other one people like to use is Caplin's Classical Form.  I tend to think Caplin is great if you have no idea what sonatas are and you want a good system for being able to talk about them in general, but the Hepokoski and Darcy provides I think a more comprehensive and flexible account of sonata-form movements."

musictheory,391bco,Fluffikini,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:46:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting observations. I would argue that although both themes differ in content and texture, perhaps the most important difference is the move to the dominant key. This has large implications for energy of this work. If the 2nd theme continued in the tonic key it would have much less of a contrast, regardless of the differences in the material.   I often ask myself, what does the move to the dominant do to me? How does it influence the interactions of the musical forces, which have a direct influence on the way I structure it."

Perhaps that difference is so central that I take it for granted in my explanations (though certainly not in my experience). I'm also wary of saying that the move to the dominant is a sufficient explanation of the contrast. I think a variety of elements are involved, and while the difference in key is the most important, there are a variety of other forces as well.   At the same time, this example is an extremely interesting example to talk about how the dominant key plays into the perception of difference. Mozart orchestrated this piece, turning it into a concerto [recording | score]. The opening ritornello presents the same basic material (what Hepokoski and Darcy call a ""rotation"" through the material), with the exception of the C space (the stuff after the successful cadence of the secondary theme), which is newly composed for the orchestra.  Here, we get the secondary theme in the tonic (as is normal for opening ritornelli), so that element of contrast is gone from the ritornello. But though the tonal relationship is closer (since both are in the tonic), there are still differences we can discuss, there's still that ""exterior"" quality to the opening and an ""interior"" quality to the second theme, the first theme is still a series of loops whereas the second theme is am antecedent/consequent pair, etc. In other words, we still hear a clear ""second theme"" in this module's rhetoric, even if it is not yet articulated in the dominant key.   But the presence of the secondary theme in the tonic actually provokes more changes to the material. Recall that I said that the secondary theme is really meant to be an eight bar period, which goes off track just before it succeeds in producing its final cadence. In the opening ritornello, Mozart actually makes that ideal phrase a reality, he removes the expansion and lets the phrase succeed in 8 bars!   This changes, at least for me, how I hear the phrase's return in the solo exposition (which is JC Bach's exposition ver batim, with some orchestration for additional color). That expansion in the secondary theme becomes more potent because I've heard the ""correct"" 8-bar phrase that it is in dialogue with. It increases my sense of ""wow, that's a really incredible evasion"" and my sense that we need to ""work our way back""  to that cadence.   It also does more for my interpretation. For me, it suggests two things: 1. That the theme is somehow successful when it occurs in the tonic, but must expend more energy to reach its cadence when placed in the dominant, and 2. That the theme somehow worked out when it was an orchestral gesture, but when the pianist articulates the theme, it encounters more obstacles. So the combination of the dominant as a more distant key and the pianist as a different medium of performance actually impacts the way the music proceeds, it has an effect on the ongoing phrase. That again opens up a space for me to think about why. What is it about the dominant and the pianist that makes the theme more difficult to achieve closure? What does this say about the relationship between pianist and Orchestra and the tonal relstionship between tonic and dominant, etc.   My own interpretation is this: since the first theme is ""orchestral"" in conception, the pianist steps out on stage miming the orchestra (an effect that is made more potent when, as in this performance, the soloist also plays the role of continuo in the orchestral ritornello), and the expansions in the secondary theme represent a way for the pianist to assume his or her own identity, to ""take matters into their own hands"" as it were. When, after much effort, the pianist succeeds in producing the cadence in the dominant (Hepokoski and Darcy's EEC or Essential Expositional Close), he or she then moves to a new module, one which has never been articulated by the orchestra at all. So I trace the gradual emergence of an autonomous individual over the course of the exposition, the pianist gradually comes into his or her own as an individual, gradually becoming more capable of autonomous action.   It's really a remarkable pair of pieces."
musictheory,391bco,nmitchell076,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"I think it is much simpler than that. Correct me if I am not understanding you completely, but I believe you are saying that the role of the dominant in the solo exposition's 2nd theme has to do with the pianist entering, and influencing the music to move somewhere else (via the dominant).   In your interpretation, you believe that the orchestra playing both themes in the tonic has to do with the concerto form within itself (ie, themes in the tonic, the piano exposition changes this) but again it has to do with energy. If the dominant appeared in the 2nd theme in the orchestral introduction, then the work would lose a siginificant amount of energy. It would be completely unbalanced. This imbalance also occurs when exposition repeats are taken in sonta form; the dominant sets up for further expansion before the development. By returning to the tonic, you lessen the impact of the piece.  It is the same in the concerto form. We are comfortable with everything in the tonic, and the first major change occurs with this move to the dominant. This is necessary for the music to occur as a singular event. I would argue that the concerto form by nature cannot ever be unified, as the duality that occurs between pianist and orchestra is too strong. But we will leave that for another discussion :)"
musictheory,391bco,maestrothrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"I think your conception and mine are largely compatible. I agree that moving to the dominant increases the energy at play in the work. What I'm discussing is how this piece realizes that move in a characteristic and individual way. And further, why the concerto genre realizes it in this way, when other ways were possible (in duets, for example, this is accomplished by modulating from I to V in the first solo statement, and then the second soloist takes you from V to V/V, as in this example).  And beyond that, all sonata form movements go to a new key (and this key is most often the dominant, except of course in mind and in later romantic works). But not all sonata form movements accomplish this in the same way. In some sonatas, the tonic feels well grounded and the dominant takes effort to secure. In others, the tonic itself is very weakly articulated or encounters some issue in its articulation, while the dominant is the thing that feels more secure. In others, both are accomplished without any ""problems"" and in still others, neither key feels very secure. And there are all sorts of minute variations in the realization of the tonic/dominant move in between. Again, I'm looking for ways to discuss how those pieces work on an individual basis, recognizing at the same time that they all participate in that energetic relationship you described.   In other words, how the energy of a dominant/tonic polarity is manifest in individual ways is what interests me.   The only part I'm in disagreement about is the repeat of the exposition. I happen to find it extremely important to sonata form. But again, that's probably beyond the scope of this thread."
musictheory,391bco,nmitchell076,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:08:34 2015 UTC,"Different pieces do things in different ways, but the overall structure, the internal harmonic structure is typically the same. We begin in some key, and then go some where. If this key is ambiguous at the start, we feel this ambiguity within us. We are the music in this sense.  But regardless, we start somewhere, go somewhere far away, and come back home. The energy of the piece is projected in this way.  Taking a repeat diminishes this relationship. In this way, there is really no such thing as a repetition. We take something in. We here it again. But it is different than the first time, and the second and third.   It is akin to driving from NY to Chicago. Why would you get half way through the experience, only to turn around and go back home?"
musictheory,391bco,maestrothrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not sure how your first statement contradicts anything I've said. I agree with all that, but I don't think it tells us how this piece is different from another piece. And again, that's what I'm interested in and that's what my original analysis attempted to do. A recognition that the energy of moving to the dominant is an important thread connecting sonatas is not what I was examining, but rather how that common material is manifested in different ways in different pieces.   For instance, I have a pair of twin cousins. They have very similar genetic material and look and act very similarly, at least compared to how my roommate Ethan looks and acts. But I can tell them apart. How? By focusing on the pattern of freckles on one vs. the other, by length of hair, by tone of voice, by their individual mannerisms, by their food preferences, by their laughter, by their relationship to me. They are very similar, but I love them in different and unique ways. Their shared DNA makes them my twin cousins, their differences make them Maggie and Katalin.   Say we were to compare this piece to one of JC Bach's own concerti. Certainly there are a lot of similarities, that's what makes both of these classical concerti, and the idea that the second theme will be presented in a ""higher energy state"" in the dominant is part of that. But there are a lot of differences too. Notice that whereas phrase expansions are limited to the secondary theme of Mozart's concerto, here JC Bach includes a phrase expansion of the first theme as well: the successful cadence from the orchestra is evaded when the pianist gets it. Then, notice that after the transition, the pianist gets to present a theme in the dominant that has never been heard before, rather than just copying what the orchestra has done. Except this theme cannot cadence by itself, but rather leads to another half cadence. After this, the orchestra returns and presents new it's ritornello material in the dominant, and the orchestra and pianist jointly articulate the V:PAC. (this ""two secondary themes, the first of which leads to a half cadence and the second of which leads to a PAC"" is a common situation that Hepokoski and Darcy call the ""Trimodular Block,"" a term that I feel is cumbersome, but works well enough).   So the two pieces are certainly under the same impulse of moving to the dominant to energize the second theme. But the difference between these realizations is astounding. In the Mozart arrangement, phrase expansions by the soloist are limited to the material in the dominant, and the pianist does not articulate a separate theme until after the second theme (henceforth, S) concludes with a PAC. Whereas in the JC Bach concerto, the material in the tonic is already subjected to expansion, the soloist ""takes the reins"" and articulates new and independent thematic material at the beginning of S rather than after S closes, and it yields this new material back to the orchestral S material. I want to know why, and the blanket statement ""material in the dominant is higher in energy,"" though true and helpful in articulating the similarities between these pieces, does nothing to tell me the differences.  For that, we have to look to other things, such as how phrases are treated and or expanded, who is presenting what material, etc.   So again, we agree that the move to the dominant is interesting, it has some energetic meaning that is common in all pieces that do this. What I'm interested in is saying the particular ways this journey is realized in individual pieces.    Taking a repeat diminishes this relationship. It is akin to driving from NY to Chicago. Why would you get half way through the experience, only to turn around and go back home?     Maybe I've got time to kill and enjoy scenery of the Midwest. Maybe seeing the scenery again will reveal something new I missed the first time. The first time, I sped by at 60 mph and was focusing a lot of my attention on the asshole in front of me who was swerving all over the interstate. So now that I'm over that, I can pay more attention to my surroundings the second time.   But I like long car rides."
musictheory,391bco,nmitchell076,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm not contradicting anything you are saying. All of these different elements contribute to what each piece is. They find different routes to the same structural movement. But the important thing is that the structure is the same. It is the most influential force behind both of these works. I also find myself falling into the trap of articulating music via the analysis, but I think we can both agree that the analysis is not the piece. It is interesting from the outside to investigate the craft, find out how these pieces tick, and how they move us. But none of this is really important when it comes down to living the stages of these works. They only require a human consciousness that is open.  If the work allows it, if the listener is open, and the performers unfold the sounds in the most beautiful way, then hearing something twice lessens the experience. If all three of these factors are in alignment (and I'll admit, it is rare that they do), then you truly live the stages and feel the need to go on. If you are open, the work allows for it, and the performers do their job, then you won't miss anything the first time. Difficult this is."

Jut as my twin cousins share much of their DNA, but I care more about who they are as distinct individuals who act in different ways and have a unique relationship to me.

Well, first of all, the fact that it is difficult to get everything in one go is probably one reason why the repeat exists. But that's beside my point, I also think it is a different experience entirely to hear the exposition the first time vs. the second. Akin to watching your favorite movie twice, or re-reading a detective story. I often have a different experience the first time I watch or read something vs. the second. Both are equally valuable, but they are different.   Have you ever experienced a work in exactly the same way twice?"
musictheory,391bco,nmitchell076,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:33:53 2015 UTC,"In re-reading a book or seeing a movie again, memory takes place. When I listen to music, or perform it, it is important to remove memory from the process altogether, to try to experience the piece for the same time.   I've never experienced a work in exactly the same way because there are a multitude of different conditions and circumstances that arise between performances.   Each piece works in a different way, but the structure is typically the same. It is colored by certain characteristics, certain motives, ideas, colors, etc, but they contribute to the whole. They contribute to the entire dynamic structure of the work.  The repeat exists because it is left over from the dance forms. As you know, development repeats were eventually dropped. Brahms eventually drops the exposition repeat as well. It's tradition."
musictheory,391bco,maestrothrowaway,6,Tue Jun 9 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"This is a very broad and good question.  The short answer is, it really depends on the piece, composer, era, etc.  Typically with Mozart and the classical composers the 1st and 2nd themes are related harmonically(the 1st theme is in the tonic of course, the 2nd in the dominant, or the mediant).  Generally there will be contrast, perhaps one theme is rhythmic, the other melodic.    I think one thing to keep in mind is that there doesn't need to really be a relationship between the two themes because the development section generally is what brings them together so to speak.    A really cool example is Shostakovich's 4th symphony.  Compare the 1st theme - opening to the around 1:30 with the 2nd theme heard in the bass clarinet briefly.  Now later on in the movement, after the development section, the recapitulation opens with what you think is going to be the 1st theme again but is actually the 2nd theme molded into it, here .  So as you can see, one of the cool things about Sonata form is not sticking to any hard and fast rules, per se, but what it allows you to do within the ""accepted"" framework."
musictheory,391bco,hornwalker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"Great response. Love the example of the combined Shostakovich themes in recap. Say, are there any examples of composers returning to themes in other pieces later in their careers, or even repeatedly during their careers?"
musictheory,391bco,ajarndaniel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"Mahler uses what he called (I believe, don't have a source) ""musical fingerprints"".  Little themes that he used across his symphonies.    Most notable is the simple major chord changing to its parallel minor. This pops up first of all in the first movement of No. 2, becomes the main motif of No. 6, and recurs again in the 2nd movement of No. 7.  Also, the opening trumpet solo of his Fifth is briefly ""previewed"" in the first movement of No. 4. Another one is the woodwind chords that start the ""march"" section of the first movt. of No. 3. This sequence briefly appears during the finale of No. 2, in the Allegro section after the two crescendi on percussion."
musictheory,391bco,hornwalker,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info; I'd suspected as much hitherto. Do you notice this phenomenon in your own compositions? Do you embrace it, or struggle to shut it out?!"
musictheory,391bco,ajarndaniel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"I don't compose, but I don't think its a bad thing.  Just as you'd use a theme throughout a piece, I think by tying your works together on a larger scale it creates another level of relationships.  I think Beethoven did that in his later works as well"
musictheory,391bco,hornwalker,0,Mon Jun 8 20:18:17 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Beethoven of course stole from himself a lot, the tiny development in his C Minor piano sonata (op 10 no 1) movement III, there is a cascading motive that directly foreshadows the opening to his 5th Symphony. It's a diminished 7th interval instead of a major 3rd, but that's only due to the harmonic context, it's still really da-da-da-dum.   Even current composers do this, like David Maslanka, who uses almost an exact phrase from his piece ""Give Us This Day"" in his more recent Symphony No 4. It really makes sense if you think about it: if a theme, motive, or particular note strikes your fancy, then use that theme, motive, or note to your heart's content (especially if it is musically sound)."

As a (totally amateur) musician, I find that certain themes have a tendency to return again and again - within my own pieces, and within others'. Once you start to fixate on something, you start to hear it - its potential - everywhere!"
musictheory,391bco,ajarndaniel,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:58:31 2015 UTC,"It has to be, that's how composers get their styles. Lots of ideas are consistent in different eras, like the movement from fifth relationships (baroque and etc.) to third relationships (late classical to romantic). Every composer has their own quirks, like Mozart's really scalar passages and pseudo-two-bar phrases."
musictheory,391bco,jfreak1024,2,Mon Jun 8 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"The relationship, regardless of any other factor, is trumped by harmony. The 2nd theme always is in a different key than the tonic. Which key? Typically the dominant. Of all the keys you must ask yourself, why the dominant?  The dominant represents the key which has the closest relationship to the tonic, being a fifth away (for example, the field of pitches in C major and G major are almost identical). This move to the dominant creates contrast not just in the music themselves but within us. Moving from C major (tonic) to say, B major is a very far move, one that bears no relationship to the tonic key.  In the development, this contrast accelerates. We may move from the dominant to the next fifth, then the next and next, until we are in the key furthest from the tonic. This is resolved when we eventually return to the tonic key.  In the recapitulation, why is the 2nd theme in the tonic key? Because moving it to the dominant creates energy, when in fact we need to be still resolving the energy created in the development.  Harmony is the most important relationship between themes. It stands above all others."
musictheory,391bco,maestrothrowaway,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:13:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for your answers. I appreciated the Shostakovich and JC Bach examples. It's just Schoenberg's concept of contrast rooted in coherence (getting contrast by changing previous elements and keeping the most important features) made me think the themes in sonata form could be related in that very organic way too, but I see the themes ""resolve"" their tension and conflict in the development and reexposition."

musictheory,38z96w,Kavehkazi,0,Mon Jun 8 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the arousal theory of humor? I think parallels to music can be drawn, in that things that cause a stronger stress response will be preferred to things that cause a weaker stress response, regardless of the positive or negative valence of that response.  I think it's generally harder to produce intense eustress in happy music than it is to produce intense distress in sad music. Any idiot can cry, but it takes a genius to make others want to sing along. Most happy songs that I value as strongly as sad songs rely on a fast tempo and crescendos, whereas most sad songs I value equivalently can fall back fairly reliably on just mimicking vocalisations, or dissonant arpeggios.  This might be personal, or it might also be another effect, but I think it's easier to induce sad emotions or to irritate the listener, than it is to inspire them or get them up and going."

musictheory,38ytv4,pornfkennedy,6,Mon Jun 8 00:16:53 2015 UTC,"For something really out there you could look at The Myth of Invariance: The Origin of the Gods, Mathematics, and Music from the Ṛg Veda to Plato. While its Big Picture theories seemed to me well in the realm of quackery it was still fun to read. It is full of things like tonal zodiacs and calendars, exploration of links between tuning commas and solar vs. lunar calendar discrepancies, and much much larger things. The author, McClain, certainly knows his music theory, math, and ancient mythology, but man. He's created a weird mix of rigorous math and musical theory combined with hugely speculative interpretations of ancient religion and philosophy.  His main Big Theory has something to do with the Ṛg Veda encoding a ""proto-science of number and tone"" with ""lattice logic"" tuning systems, problems and solutions expressed poetically. And that this ancient Vedic ""proto-science"" is linked to Sumer, Babylon, ancient Greece, Pythagoreas, and pretty much everything. A bit from the intro:   A musical analysis of Ṛgvedic imagery will provide, we believe, a new tool for the study of the origins of science, of our calendar, of musical theory, and of the roots of our civilization.   Yea. His vision is grand but has a kind of conspiracy theory mystical ""this explains everything"" vibe. On the way he dives into musical/tuning interpretations of not just ancient Indian and Greek stuff, but the Sumer, Babylon, Book of Revelation, Mayan cosmology, the Egyptian Book of the Dead, Atlantis, and more.  So yea, it is out there, but rather fun if nothing else. There's lots of charts and diagrams of tonal yantras, mandalas, so such, tied to just intonation, commas, tetrachords, scales, etc.   Here's another quote, chosen almost at random, on the topic of ancient flood myths and arks (which are both interpreted as metaphors for math and music theory):   The flood itself, I am inclined to believe, is an allegory for the flood of numbers it is necessary to generate to find out how close the powers of 3 and the powers of 5 can coincide, especially near the elusive locus of the square root of 2. The Vedic solution, in the smallest integers, was reconstructed in the yantras of Chart 15, involving numbers of ten digits. The saving arks, so I assume from the correspondences being developed here, are the minimal yantras various cultures found useful in preserving the essential data, after it was known that the very largest ones were not going to pin down the arithmetical locus of a number we now know to be irrational... The Babylonian ark is a cube, 1203 = 1,728,000, identical with the Hindu Krta Yuga in numerosity... [on and on]   Then after another page about arks he takes it to the next level of wacky:   There may be a deeper ""harmonical"" pun in the Babylonian flood story. In mathematical harmonics we first meet the number 8 in the ""musical proportion"" 6:8::9:12 which establishes tetrachord frames, multiplied to 30:40::45:60 in the model octave. Hence 8 in the first context corresponds to 40 in the second, 40 being the number of Enki, ""god of the sweetwaters"", so that the ark number 8,0,0 sexagesimally may have carried with it an overtone of meaning linking the god of the fresh waters ultimately falling from the sky with the ark which preserves a remnant of the mankind he is responsible for.   Ok, I'll stop. Meant to just mention the book, but looking at it got me wanting to quote it. So weird."

musictheory,3915y8,VapedScoops,2,Mon Jun 8 14:24:02 2015 UTC,"So you understand that in the scale, there are seven notes, starting with the tonic, right? The chord with that tonic note as its root would be the first note, or I. The chord with the second note as its root would be two. Etc.  If the triad is a major triad, the Roman numeral is capitalised (I, II, III). If triad is minor, the Roman numeral is lowercase (i, ii, iii).  Remember that the BASE note and the ROOT note are not the same. A triad written with an E in the bass, C in tenor, G in alto, and C in the soprano line is NOT an E chord. It is still a C chord. Since it is a major chord, the Roman numeral would be capitalised. In the key of C, this chord would be I.  So, in short: check the key, figure out the BASE of the chord, figure out where in the key that base is, then figure out the quality (major minor).  This is an extreme crash course and misses out on a good deal of nuance, but if you stick to this you'll get a decent amount of credit for this part of the assignment. Maybe enough to pass."

Ex: A chord progression goes G - C - D - G, in G major this is 1,4,5 or I-IV-V-I, if we were to add the correct labeling it would look like this. I7-IV7-Vb7-I7.  The reason we put a b7 on the 5th chord is that it's a dominant chord in both major and minor, dominant basically means a flat 7th.  Hope this helps, I'd be happy to answer any questions if you have any more!"

The perspective that Ionian and Aeolian won some sort of Modal Battle Royale or that they somehow better capture the true essence of the nature of the overtone series are not really considered to capture how the major and minor systems emerged in history.  It is a very difficult and convoluted topic, and there were several paths that led from ""modality"" to ""tonality.""

musictheory,38zmwo,tjmusic,2,Mon Jun 8 09:56:32 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that it was always the most popular.  Our understanding of music history is colored by the simple fact that from the fall of Rome until the late medieval, the only literate people were clergy - and if it wasn't liturgical, they didn't write it down.  In fact, when I was an undergrad (in the 1970s) our music history class specifically taught that the major/minor scales developed in the 12th century.  It would have been more accurate to say the earliest written evidence dated to then, because while I was in college Anne Draffkorn Kilmer was publishing evidence of major scale tonality, and harmonization in thirds, dating to 2000BCE.  I personally think it likely that major and minor scales always were the dominant ones used in secular music, and the reason they're dominant today is the same as the reason for much of what music theory covers: tradition."

The transition here is a jump from G# to Cmin, which is a vi in the new key.  The examples you chose are pretty different actually. The first one is just an off-key chord, with the note A being super dissonant and minor-sounding because we were expecting an A#.

musictheory,38wyrn,aeropagitica,3,Sun Jun 7 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"This is a really fantastic question! Unfortunately I don't have time to write out a really detailed answer right now, but the short answer is that there is no simple ordering like there is for the diatonic modes. That's because the diatonic scale is constructed from 6 perfect fifths in a row. The melodic minor scale isn't constructed from repeating an interval consistently, so you can't do the same thing.  But you can get close! The trick is to recognize that you need to treat Melodic Minor & Dorian b9 separately from the rest:  Start with Melodic Minor. To go to the ""next"" mode, you lower 7, skip 8, and then lower 9. That gives you Dorian b9.  Now we start with Lydian Augmented & do a similar process. Take Lydian augmented: lower 5, skip 6, lower 7. That gives you Lydian Dominant.  From Lydian Dominant: lower 4, skip 5, lower 6. That gives you Mixolydian b6.  From Mix b6: lower 3, skip 4, lower 5. That gives you Semilocrian.  From Semilocrian: lower 2, skip 3, lower 4. That gives you Superlocrian.   At that point you run out of modes, because you'd have to lower 1 to continue, which changes the tonic.  So the order goes: Lydian Aug, Lydian Dom, Mix b6, Semilocrian, Superlocrian. Then on a separate list you get Melodic Minor, Dorian b9. So it's basically the list that you had, except we've separated out two of them to make the pattern clearer."

musictheory,38wyrn,aquamarine_tangerine,4,Sun Jun 7 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"My apologies.  The Major Scale Modes can be ordered in such a way that each successive Mode has one additional flattened note:  1) Lydian (#4);   2) Ionian (nat.4);  3) Mixolydian (b7);  4) Dorian (b3, b7);  5) Aeolian (b3, b6, b7);  6) Phyrgian (b2, b3, b6, b7);   7) Locrian (b2, b3, b5, b6, b7).  Is there an equally efficient order of the Modes of the Melodic Minor scale that can be written in these same terms?"
musictheory,38wyrn,aquamarine_tangerine,2,Sun Jun 7 17:52:43 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I thought that's what you might've meant. AFAIK, no. Harmonic minor is quite a different beast, though. It's worthwhile to do this with major scale modes because you'll always run into the modes of major. With harm minor modes, there are really only a few key ones that are worthwhile.  The only ones you'd really ever need are Lydian Aug, Lydian Dom, Superlocrian, and Melodic Minor. The other ones just don't come up, unless you're playing obscure jazz charts.  I've never seen the others in a necessary fashion.  Also, the reason the modes are arranged like that is more to attune the ear to the sound from brightest to darkest sounding mode. With Harmonic Minor, they all sound dark...or at the very least, odd (lyd aug)."

My teacher actually got that one wrong, so I always say super is the natural 2.   Anyway, as far as Jazz is concerned, you can play both of those over an altered dominant chord and get away with it.  The whole point of a dominant chord is to create tension, so what better way to create tension than to play notes that aren't inherently in the Mixolydian mode? Dabble in playing diminished on the b9, the semilocrian mode and the superlocrian mode."

Without commenting on whether or not OP is correct (I haven't checked the link yet), that seems to be the claim made here.  It's also worth noting that context is relevant: when Green Day dropped 7/8 bars into Before the Lobotomy, that was kind of impressive simply because of how low a standard they'd set for themselves (technically speaking) on previous albums; you kinda got the impression that 3/4 was a struggle for them prior to that. This is also part of what OP seems to be talking about; 11/8 isn't inherently complex or clever, but in the context of pop music, it is unusual.

It's like the time signature equivalent of ""high school rock bands"" (well, guitarists in general...) who come up with some chord progression or strumming pattern and base the whole song around that. and lock themselves into that specific thing.  I have a theory that people really aren't that satisfied with that kind of music, and only write that way because they think they're supposed to. They've never heard any better, or if they have, they aren't conscious of what made it better.

Of course Green Day can play in more than one time signature, but the fact is that they very rarely choose to do so. 2) Playing in duple, triple, and quadruple metre is not playing ""in a variety of time signatures"", and I think 21st Century Breakdown is actually their only album to venture outside of these (huh, who thought I'd ever say so many positive things about that album). 3) I'm not stating as a fact that they were ever incapable of 7/8 (though I suspect that Billie Joe Armstrong may have been); I'm stating that within the context of their rhythmically uninteresting music, 7/8 was substantially more interesting than it would have been from an established prog band."

They all do seriously awesome work with orchestration and timbre. Jupiter was my favorite of the three, followed by the firebird. Daphnis felt a bit dull, these composers, they use all sorts of timbre variation, and it's cool, but it's gets really boring.  On the subject of brass, although I admit these people have a much greater idea of what they're doing, they (Jupiter somewhat excepted) still seem to use brass sparingly in orchestral arrangements.  What of their work uses brass significantly?  wait a minute, Bolero ~listens to~ Okay, that deserves to be as famous as it is at least. Sweet song seriously. Still uses brass mostly as icing on the cake of strings and woodwinds, and is a diamond in the rough...  Kay, final thoughts: brass isn't often used for chords (is bad at chords?), nor soft passages, although this sometimes happens (a bit bad at this, hence loud trumpet jokes), and until recently composers haven't used their (brass's) timbre very well except for playing big loud melodies."

That 'exactly' bit is really important, because it's what lets your song emulate that certain sound/atmosphere/style without just copying what someone else has done. It gives you guidelines and tips; not the foundation+embellishment (although if you analyze a song well you'll probably have those two things). Anyway...  Say you're writing your song and you want it to sound X. The first step is finding a song or a bit of a song that captures the sound that you're trying to achieve. Then you analyze that song with theory, and use your knowledge of theory to simplify it (usually this means playing just the chords, or taking out certain non-chord tones and seeing what they do. By doing this you've figured out which piece of the 'music puzzle' [song] makes the sound you like.  Let's say X equals dreamy/atmospheric/wispy/nebulous; that kind of thing. It kinda sounds like this. Google the sheet music, use our theory knowledge,  simplify it (well this one's already simplified) and we see that the progression at the start is IM7 | VM7. So we can conclude that Major-Sevenths sound like the sound we want, and now when we want to create X effect, we can use major-sevenths, just like Erik Satie did.  So we know how to achieve X sound, but we aren't shoehorned into doing one thing. We don't lose our freedom of options because ""Use major-sevenths"" is still pretty vague instruction; but it will get us the sound we want.

Personally I think Cage is trying to call great attention to the musical and aural circumstances of the performer and audience, something often overlooked in Western theoretical practice.   In my opinion, the least artistic thing you can do is failing to do what you intended to do. Even in an indeterminate or aleatoric piece, there is some sort of idea that is meant to be performed. That performance can take on an infinite number of realities due to the specific circumstances of that performance, but the musician can still 'fail' to do what they intended. Even if that 'failure' sounds really fucking cool, it's not what you initially wanted and is a happy accident. Now if your intent is to dick around until you find something you like, you can call that inspiration or improvisation, but I believe it is the intent to be artistic that causes artistry.   TL;DR: Do what you intended to do, otherwise you messed up trying to do that and are therefore inartistic in that moment (regardless of what comes out of that moment)."

To get Fb, you need to go counter-clockwise and go DOWN a fifth from Cb. Cb has 7 flats, so Fb would have 8 flats (hence the double flat in the key signature).  As a little tip, key signatures are a bit like simplifying in math. If F major has one flat (Bb), it makes sense that, to get Fb major, you would just add a flat to everything; thus you have everything flatted in the key signature, and adding a flat to Bb gets you Bbb.  This can get more complex: you're in E major, which has 4 sharps. To get to Eb, just put a flat on everything. The flat ""cancels out"" the 4 sharps and leaves you with 3 flats (since there are seven distinct pitches in the scale).  (Edit: In short, the number of accidentals between E and Eb will add up to 7. This is the same of any two keys where the pitch name [not the accidental!] match: C/C#, C/Cb, D/Db, etc. It works in minor, too: G minor is 2 flats, G# minor is 5 sharps.)  p. 22: The augmented seconds are between inside the stars in the third row. Don't forget that the key signature has an Eb in it--the augmented seconds are thus between F# and Eb, or scale degrees 6 and 7 in harmonic minor. This is why you get E to F# in row 4 and F to Eb in row 5.  p. 27: In popular music and jazz, these 1/3/5/6 root position chords are more common.

Also, you will learn key signatures during Theory I, but you likely won't spend a ton of time on them and will be expected to know them for the rest of the material. So I recommend studying up on those if you need to (major and minor). If you already know this stuff, you're in really good shape.   As far as the corequisite class goes, I might check out some of the interval exercises on musictheory.net to get a basic idea of some stuff you will be doing, but don't freak out if it's really difficult, and don't make it a priority if you need to also study reading the sheet music.

How difficult the audition will be is dependent upon the school, the faculty, the degree path, etc. They will take it all into consideration. They will want you to learn something in line with what they teach though, so your self-taught pop music chops probably will not do you any good. Just toss all that aside. The important thing is to talk to program heads to find out what they want. I called the school I was interested in and they directed me to the department head for my instrument. This person put me in touch with one of their grad students to take lessons from. I started at the very beginning of classical guitar. My previous 8 years of guitar playing didn't help one single bit. I might as well have been handed a piccolo or a harp. With jazz it may be different.   I too was worried about piano and reading, so while taking guitar lessons I found a local piano teacher and enrolled in multiple music theory courses at the same time. A year later I passed my guitar audition first try and I started music school the following semester. Five years later I had an expensive and meaningless music theory degree.  As far as extracurricular goes, the faculty will help you find a place to fit in. Try lots of things, but pick something you are comfortable with and love. The people you play with and who lead the group will make or break it for you. Musicians are a different breed of person. They can be cold and cruel. Be prepared for that. If you aren't worried about falling flat on your face in front of people who are better then you then you'll be just fine. I was too sensitive to that. It's a weakness of mine that you hopefully don't share.  Music school was one of the worst experiences of my entire life. I absolutely have PTSD from it. I had to work part time while taking 17+ hours a semester to pull it off, so I rarely got more than a couple hours of sleep at a time when we weren't on break. I don't recall getting a full nights sleep unless I pretended to be sick. I gained weight, lost a lot of hair, became generally unhealthy, and a times lost my sanity. It's one of those things you just can't understand it until you've don't it. The idea of walking into a practice booth and feeling the pressure of the sound-proof door closing makes me weak in the knees to this day.  On top of the physical demands, it was extremely difficult to cope with the pressures of juries, master-classes, private lessons, staying immersed in the community, and the utter embarrassment of not being able to sight read well enough to hang with ensembles. It will be like walking into a party as a total stranger where everyone else knows the birthday girl. The people you will be learning from will be total professionals and your classmates will be people who have been playing since they were toddlers. The classes you will struggle with will be absolutely laughable to them. Meanwhile, you are just a person with a dream. For a guy like me, all of this totaled up to absolute heart-wrenching torture every single day. This was slightly made up for by the fact that I excelled at all the non-performance based things like composition, orchestration, and conducting, so I received just enough sprinkles of respect to help me see it out to the end.   You can do it. But there are also other (cheaper) avenues to becoming a music teacher. Namely just being really badass at playing. Be ready to work your freaking ass off for at least a few years if you want to do the school route. Be ready to be stressed and humbled constantly at a real music school. Community college will of course be easier. I have little experience education arm of music school, but it is the only one that will guarantee you the competency and qualifications needed to actually  make money upon graduation, so I think it's a wise choice in your position.   Good luck."

I had a few more basics going in, but the feeling of not being able to do anything quite well enough, and added pressure I totally get. It does get easier though because you do learn and get better."
musictheory,38sted,RiverStrymon,3,Thu Jun 11 20:13:05 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with /u/RiverStrymon in that it's mostly about time management and dedication. Yes, you want a basic background going in, but as long as you stay on top of your work, you should be fine. A working knowledge of all note names and fundamental understanding of key signatures before you start will help a lot. Your TA's are also a good source to get help from. They are your TA for a reason after all. I am a TA for a music history course (working on a musicology masters) and I know it seems like it might be more beneficial to go to the professor first, but odds are your TA will be able to work with your schedule much better.  As far as lessons go, there are always options depending on what you want to do. I graduated with a bachelor's in music, but I know many people who do a bachelor's of arts degree instead. With this you're still a music major, but your required course load is quite different. I know private lessons/being in a studio is not as rigorous with this degree. I know many music majors more interested in the scholarly music areas (theory and musicology) that tend to go this route. There is also always the option of a music minor, which would still give you the credentials to open up a small studio, especially with a pop music focus. With this you could always get a degree in education or something similar and so basic music classes.  Good luck with your future endeavors. Music is a much harder field than people think, but it is full of very rewarding work!"
musictheory,38sted,garbear007,5,Sun Jun 7 04:25:58 2015 UTC,"In my experience, more important than a background in music is the ability to withstand pressure and manage your time well. A lot of people don't realize it, but Music is often considered to be one of the most difficult majors. You will often be taking many more classes than your friends, and many are far more demanding/time consuming than their credits might suggest. In addition, you need the self discipline to maintain a regular practicing schedule because unlike some other fields, there's never going to be a point where you've ""learned"" the bass, however good you are, you can always be better, and that's on top of more traditional classes like music theory and music history, which can be extremely intensive in their own right. Plus, it seems like the education courses you need will never line up nicely with the music courses you need, which can be a headache.  If you feel you're capable of all of that, though, and remain passionate, you'll go far. Fastidiousness is far more essential than any inborn talent or prior training."

They're boring, but they are also essential, and I guarantee it will be the most difficult part of Class Piano 1 for you. Take it slow (I've switched my metronome to sixteenth notes and brought it down to 20BPM while learning some piano stuff) and find the correct fingerings. It may be somewhat easier for you because of your experience with fretted instruments and piano fingering numbers is somewhat similar to tablature.  I'd also highly, highly recommend taking choir. There should be at least an entry level choir at the community college you're looking at. You can think of it as ""forced practice time"" for aural skills, but it will also help give you a great appreciation and ear for harmony. In addition, it would allow you to pursue ""broad endorsement"" for music education, which will greatly increase your employment options. It doesn't matter if you feel like you can't sing. I followed a course very similar to the one you're about to embark on, and when I started in community college I'd never taken choir and I could barely read music (I was a percussionist throughout my early education - great with rhythm, but even with four years of timpani in highschool I could barely read bass clef and treble clef almost not at all. Lots of A C E G and F A C E for me at first). By the time I left, I was a music theory geek and in the most advanced vocal and instrumental ensembles. I can't overstate how much taking choir has improved my understanding and appreciation of music."

musictheory,38uo4t,vornska,2,Sun Jun 7 01:00:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's bad. When I write stuff in minor I avoid V 'cause it gives major feel.  Though, the book I read, tells that IAC and PAC differs only in whether there tonic in top voice or not."
musictheory,38uo4t,vornska,2,Sun Jun 7 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Well you can do whatever you want when you write stuff. Classical composers felt the opposite: they felt that if you didn't use the major V, minor keys slipped too easily into the relative major. But if you like the sound of what you are writing, why change?   Though, the book I read, tells that IAC and PAC differs only in whether there tonic in top voice or not.   This is correct."
musictheory,38uo4t,bluejazzer,3,Sun Jun 7 02:26:16 2015 UTC,"Every theory class I've ever attended always has described a perfect authentic cadence as V/V7 to I in root position with the tonic in the soprano (top) voice. The phrasing of the last example you give is the closest, with one big problem — per common practice rules, the only chord that actually operates as a dominant is V or V7. Other chords that include the leading tone (vii°, iii, or ♭II7) are given other terms with respect to their function, such as predominant (meaning ""before the dominant"") or secondary leading tone chord depending on what purpose they ultimately serve.   This stems from the harmonic practices of the common practice period, roughly 1600AD - 1900AD (or from the beginning of the Renaissance up through the later end of the Romantic period).  Even though chords like vii° and iii can be used to function as dominant chords in modern harmonic practice, I wouldn't call anything but a V or V7 chord going to I in root position with tonic in the soprano a PAC. It wouldn't fit with common practice, which is generally what you're going to run into in your theory classes.  Now...if you're taking a class in late romantic or 20th-century harmony? All bets are off and you can do pretty much whatever you please. :)   Hope this helps.  (edit: I was in error about the position of the dominant chord - the V or V7 needs to be in root position for it to be considered perfect.)"
musictheory,38uo4t,tsunderemo,2,Sun Jun 7 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"PAC is a cadence that has V to I motion, with the tonic in the top voice. They are easily heard, and the tonic in the top voice IS important because naturally our ears hear the highest notes/frequencies above all other sounds. So the tonic in the top voice stands out and makes it ""perfect"" as opposed to IAC which doesn't have such a strong resolution feel because the top voice doesn't have a tonic sticking out to our ears."
musictheory,38uo4t,euphguy812,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:02:50 2015 UTC,PAC= V or V7 to I/i in root position with the tonic in the melody or soprano. vii to I is a leading tone IAC. V or V7 to I/I while either are inverted are inverted IACs. V or V7 to I/I while the tonic is not in the melody/soprano is called root position IAC.
musictheory,38wx3v,haydukk,7,Sun Jun 7 15:12:21 2015 UTC,"You can narrow it down to three pitches: C, G#, F#. One way to look at it would be a dominant seventh chord with an omitted fifth. If you respell C as B#, that's G#, B#, F# (G#7 omit 5). This particular example happens to be in first inversion with the third and root doubled.   Why does it work? You could look at it in terms of step-wise motion. All of the pitches of G#7omit5 are either a half step or whole step away from the preceding chord, A major. Parallel motion can serve as a device that logically connects two chords. The same principle applies when going from G#7omit5 to E major. There is one common tone (G#), and C can move down a half step and F# can move up a whole step."

musictheory,38t1bk,xiipaoc,4,Sat Jun 6 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  First of all, let's be clear that you've picked a piece that deliberately tries to sound exotic & by definition is trying to stretch the boundaries of the common practice as a harmonic language. Moreover any generalization is bound to have exceptions: the existence of a few popular exoticist pieces doesn't change the fact that this kind of scalar thinking is misleading for most classical music.  Second, the tune you're thinking of (here?) clearly happens over a dominant pedal. This is even clearer the second time the tune comes back here where it serves as an extended dominant prolongation before the beginning of a new section in major. It comes back at the end after the structural PAC as a way of tonicizing the minor subdominant in the context of a Picardy third, the ultimate Romantic cliche. The tonal center is not what's necessary for a ""phrygian dominant"" scale: we're in a minor key that's exploiting the augmented second between #7 and b6.  Third, the dominant is decorated melodically by b6 and #4. Even if we didn't disagree about the tonal center, this isn't the right collection of pitches for the phrygian dominant. It's the ""double harmonic minor"" scale."
musictheory,38t1bk,vornska,2,Sat Jun 6 18:57:03 2015 UTC,"Third, the dominant is decorated melodically by b6 and #4. Even if we didn't disagree about the tonal center, this isn't the right collection of pitches for the phrygian dominant.   I disagree, because a bit of decoration does not a scale unmake.  The 4 is there pretty clearly as well -- 5 b6 5 4 3, 5 4 3 b2 1.  1 7 1 b2 3 4 5 4 3, b2 1 b2 3 4 5 4 3 b2 1.  (I skipped a repetition and didn't bother with repeated notes.)  There's a 7 instead of a b7, true, but, again, that's a small elaboration, and even if you were to consider it an essential part of the scale instead of just an altered neighbor tone, the essential 1 b2 3 4 5 is still there, very clearly, and in a scale.   The tonal center is not what's necessary for a ""phrygian dominant"" scale   Actually, that second time it's even more clear that the pedal is a tonic pedal.  The 1 and 5 are held, instead of just the 5 in the timpani in the first passage.  You hold a chord long enough, and it becomes the tonic.  In particular, you have here a whole melody based on this chord -- a complete melody.  Its context within the rest of the piece doesn't negate the fact that here, right now, that chord functions as a tonic, even if it changes behavior later on at a transition point.  To address your first point, though, yes, this is definitely an anomaly in Common Practice music, but I'd say it's at least within the canon of ""classical music"", whatever that means.  Furthermore, modes in general are misleading for classical music, which pretty much only admits major and minor in Common Practice.  Forget phrygian dominant; phrygian is already out of scope.  But if OP's teacher was talking about the modes of the major scale, unless the context of the discussion was the church music of Europe's Middle Ages (which didn't use those modes either, but that's another point), none of them are really relevant to Common Practice music."

My guess is that your professor is giving you limited information to put you on the path for a course of Western traditional harmony, which uses a major/minor modal system and emphasizes the functional quality of chords within that system. In a way, I understand. On the other hand, my fundamentals professor discussed all sorts of scales in his class and was very open to the idea of nontraditional pitch collections. We did not revisit diatonic modes until third semester harmony (in accordance to where it shows up in Kostka & Payne's Tonal Harmony), and then it was a small discussion. In Common Practice harmony (which focuses on 18th century tonal style), you don't touch modes other than major and minor. I taught myself that stuff outside of class."

musictheory,38t1bk,xiipaoc,0,Sat Jun 6 23:33:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think of it as the fifth mode of harmonic minor, because harmonic minor is kind of fake (it's no different from regular minor; you just don't actually raise the 6th going up or lower the 7th coming down), but, yeah, phrygian dominant is very, very real.  It's all over Jewish music, for one -- even where it has no business being.  It has become so strongly associated with Ashkenazic Jewish music (even though Sephardim use it too, just less often) that in the Golden Age of Chazanut (cantorial music -- approximately the 1920's and 1930's), cantors would record in this mode when traditionally some other mode should have been used instead!  Outside the Jewish world, Havah Nagilah is one of the more famous Jewish tunes in this mode.  We call it Ahavah Rabbah, after a prayer that should be in that mode (but modern composers ruin everything and now most people sing it in minor, but it should be in phrygian dominant).  Actually, Ahavah Rabbah when used in klezmer music is indeed phrygian dominant, but in liturgy, it's not exactly the same thing because liturgical modes are more than simply scales.  But I don't need to get into that.  Spanish music also uses this scale enough that some even call it the ""Spanish scale"".  In Spanish music it usually takes on a different character, though.  Instead of being the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale, it's the fifth mode of the melodic minor scale -- 1 2 3 4 going up, 4 b3 b2 1 coming down, and the tonic is major.  So you have the common and famous Andalusian Cadence: iv - bIII - bII - I.  The fourth mode of harmonic minor, which some call dorian #4 or Ukranian-Dorian or Mi Sheberach (which, again, is the name of a prayer that doesn't really use this mode anymore), is also pretty widely used, but less so because it lacks a IV or iv chord.  Your teacher is a tool who goes by the book and has no knowledge or intellectual curiosity.  I assume.  Don't listen to that teacher.  Hell, even if you had been the first person to ever think of this scale (you're late by several thousand years, I'd guess, but still), it's still completely valid.  That said, I don't think jazz modes exist as scales, either.  They're horizontal chords; they're collections of pitches used in improvisation.  But they are members of a harmonic structure, while a scale is a framework for such a structure.  If you compose a piece in C major, you will likely use F major, D minor, G major, A minor, C major chords (not in that order, probably).  These are some of the chords in C major.  If you're improvising, instead of seeing these chords, you see F lydian, D dorian, G mixolydian, A aeolian, C ionian.  The piece is still in C major!  The piece could be in these other modes, but it isn't."

This piece is a lot of fun. Meshuggah could give Tool a run for their money if this is typical of their metric and rhythmic exploration."

D   -> Eb    Bb -> Bb  G -> G  example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkBHWfxVMEo  Has the i- vi- maj v progression and you can hear the power of the vi. but its also a good leading chord."
musictheory,38r9yg,Nobrr,2,Sat Jun 6 03:54:32 2015 UTC,"If the piece is in E♭, then it's simply a vi chord going to I, which is a common thing in pop music as well as classical. However, since you've mentioned that it goes to an E♭7 that tells me (unless this is jazz) that you're going to a dominant chord of some kind.   If it were in E♭, a chord based on G would be a iii chord, which can be used as a substitute for the I chord in that key. However, that usage is rare. It's more likely that the G chord is being a perfectly-normal minor iv chord in the key of D minor and your E♭ chord is actually a Neapolitan (or ♭II) chord. The added 7th makes things interesting, though.  So that was probably the worst explanation in the world, but what I'm guessing this is doing is it's going to go somewhere else:  Gm -> E♭7 -> A♭ (new key?)  Or, using roman numerals:  d: iv -> (N) V7/♭V -> A♭: I  ...which is an unusual progression, but it's one that certainly works.  Or it could do something completely different, and it all depends on how the 7th of the chord is spelled:  Gm -> E♭7 -> A7 -> Dm   d: iv -> ♭II7 (N) -> V7 -> i  So: How the 7th in the E♭7 chord is spelled and how this works. If the 7th is spelled as a C♯, it's being used to delay the dominant chord (the A chord) and acts to prolong the dominant function of the progression. If, however, it's spelled as a D♭ (which is how it normally would be) then it's far likelier that it's the first situation I describe above and is being used to modulate or change key to a distant key (♯IV, which is a tritone away from the original - about as far from home as you can get in tonal music).   Hopefully that made some sense.  (edit: fix-a-flat)"

How well you can do in a situation like this, is indicative of your skill. And in the classical world it can be a valuable skill.   Based on your post, it seems that you're not in the classical world. What you term sight reading is anytime you use music while performing. This is just referred to as ""reading"" in my world.   In more vernacular genres, music is most often learned by rote and memorized before being expected to perform it. My rock band was that way, everyone in the band memorized their music and THEN worked on making it better.   But in the classical world, members of an orchestra almost never memorize their parts, and instead rehearse the music while reading it, up until and including, the performance. Thus we need a separate term for the skill of playing it without being familiar with it, and playing it after rehearsing it, since both utilize sheet music."

musictheory,38ry4q,Xandari11,7,Sat Jun 6 12:05:36 2015 UTC,"The conductor's role in performance is to look the way he or she wants the music to sound. It's the duty of the musicians to keep an eye on the conductor, and make it sound the way the conductor intends it to sound.  But it's not necessary to watch the conductor like a hawk for every subdivided 16th note. Peripheral vision helps a lot, and aural cues from your colleagues in the orchestra help too. Both of these things are absolutely essential in a sight-reading situation, because my eyes are constantly moving from the note I'm playing, to the key signature, to the time signature, to the notes coming up, to the upcoming key change.   In a piece where there has been enough rehearsal time to prepare the part, I know it (both visually and aurally) well enough that I can devote more of my conscious visual attention on the conductor and more aural attention to my fellow performers.   And the combination of, lets say 1/3 of my attention is visual on the conductor, 1/3 of my attention is visual on the sheet music, and 1/3 of my attention is aural on my colleagues, I can play it perfectly (or nearly so) without memorizing it."

musictheory,38ry4q,fuckyeahpeace,3,Sat Jun 6 12:13:47 2015 UTC,"To add to /u/romericus' very good post, I want to point out that there are kind of ""degrees of sightreading"" in many classical situations. Although performers in an orchestra don't memorize the part, they aren't performing it from scratch without ever seeing it before (most of the time). They will have rehearsed it a few times (this is another job of the conductor - directing the rehearsal process and making sure everyone's on the same page literally and figuratively), and probably practiced it at home, especially particularly tricky parts. If it's a popular piece, they'll almost definitely have played it before - I'm actually fairly sure most professional orchestral musicians could play Beethoven's 5th from memory if they really had to.   So in this type of situation, yes, they'll be referring to the music rather than memorizing the whole thing (which, for an hour+ long romantic symphony, is pretty understandable), they will also have enough familiarity to look up frequently at the conductor for cues, tempo changes, and other information.   It depends on who you're asking (and the context) as to whether or not someone considers this type of performance ""sight reading"", and probably depends on exactly how much rehearsal occurred and the person's familiarity with the piece.   I sing professionally in some church and community choirs, where although there is usually one or two rehearsals, we learn new pieces every week and it's never close to memorized. I still consider this basically sightreading even though it's not literally the first time I've seen the piece. On the other hand, I would not count those pieces if we were talking about a sight singing exam for college or a strictly objective measure of my reading skill. On the other hand, next week I'm singing in a lab choir for a conductors' workshop, where I'll basically be looking at the piece for the first time when I show up and am expected to sing it pretty much accurately while still responding to the conductor. That's definitely sightreading."

There is lots of sight-reading in pop music as well.  If time & budget permit, you may have a rehearsal to sight read the hard parts.  The for the show or recording, you are playing the hard parts for the second time, and sight reading the easy parts."
musictheory,38ry4q,wegwirfst,7,Sun Jun 7 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"In virtually every setting I've worked in in music, sight reading is the skill of reading on sight with no previous experience with the music.  It's probably used that way as a way to gauge that type of proficiency.  It's important to know if someone can fluently sightread music.  A person doesn't ask you if you can sightread with the implication that you can practice the music a lot and then use the music as a crutch to make it through after lots of practice.  They ask if you can sightread because most of the time they are literally dropping new music in front of you in real time.  I've had plenty of gigs where I'm literally sightreading during the performance.  To working musicians, the term becomes meaningless if it can apply to the broader spectrum that you're suggesting.  Though, I'd suggest there''s some grey area.  There are plenty of things I feel like I'm ""sightreading"" even if I've played them before.  I mean, if I play a piece of music on sight at a gig and then a year later play the same piece on another gig, I'm realistically sightreading it both times because I sure as hell don't remember any of it.  I'm definitely employing my sightreading skills and from this point of view, I feel your friend is being a bit legalistic.  If you're a very good sightreader and technically proficient, I suppose you could sightread the same piece many times if they were divided by enough time.  I read a vast volume of music and will often see the same music again and not even realize it unless someone tells me.  If something is so easy for you that it takes not effort to play, it just doesn't stick out.  Now, something difficult that I had to work on, even if briefly, ends up sticking in my mind a little more.  That's something that happens very infrequently for me on trumpet, though much more frequently on piano.  But if you're playing a ridiculous amount of music all the time, you can't really remember any of it just due to the absolute flood of stuff that ends up being impossible to keep in your brain.  Also, this is why very short, unfamiliar pieces in great volume are the best for practicing sightreading.  If they are short and plentiful, you'll never be able to ""learn"" them and even better if you're not using familiarity as a crutch.  You really notice this if you ask a student to sightread a simplified version of something like Jingle Bells.  They will play the rhythm how they think it goes rather than what's on the page more often than not.  Have prior knowledge of a melody when sightreading it kinda cheats you on the development of that skill.  Ultimately, it's an issue of connotation.  When people are talking about the skill of sightreading it has to with being able to read it with no prior knowledge.  If that means no prior knowledge due to forgetfulness, that probably still counts.  I definitely wouldn't put sightreading and memorizing at black and white ends of the spectrum though."

It's definitely a matter of degrees, too. While I think anyone can get to the point of hearing a pretty complex series of pitches or harmonies internally, I'm less sure that it's possible for everyone to develop the skill to audiate things like timbre and acoustic information like that. (Someone can chime in with more info here, though, it's something I've always wanted to know).   I would suggest practicing by trying to ""hear"" music scores in your head (IMSLP is good for this). You may need to sing them first, but eventually you should be able to just ""hum it in your head"" even if you're not actively singing. Another activity is to find karaoke tracks for songs and see if you can hear the melody in your head.   While I think there are many ways to being a good composer, yeah, I'd say this is a pretty useful skill. Maybe not essential, but important. If you don't hear music in your head, I'm not really sure how you could write it. That said, you don't need to compose a whole symphony in your head. Playing/singing things or even using a DAW are also valid ways to write music, but internal audiation is also worthwhile to develop."

Listen to lots of pieces that use the chord in question, play them for yourself on the piano in a variety of keys and voicings, and solfège them out as arpeggios. The more you hear them, the quicker they'll come.   Also, as a general rule, listen to the bass.

How can you write music if you don't know what you're writing?  Hearing music in your head is really skill number 1 here.  I'm guessing it can be trained, but I've been good at this as long as I can remember.  I would be on the school bus in elementary school, listening to music -- music in my head -- and sometimes singing along.  In particular, I think it was the theme from Disney's Electrical Parade or whatever it was called.  I still remember parts of it.  It was something I listened to a lot, though.  If you somehow can't hear music in your head, you really need to start.

I think of audiation as similar to understanding a language. When you understand a language, you can think about what you hear, you can riff on it, you can talk about it with other people. (I have some more thoughts about this here, in case you're interested: http://music-ed-notes.tumblr.com/post/112702582158/audiation-the-meaning-behind-the-sounds )  There are lots of ways to practice and build the skill of internal hearing. Programs like http://www.gnu.org/software/solfege/, or web tools like http://meludia.com/ .  I'm also working on something for audiation (http://musikata.com), but it's going to take some time and teammates ;) .  Another good way is just to try to play back what you hear from recordings. Start simple, then work your way up to more complex things. If you do it for just a little bit each day, you'll definitely get better.  Good luck!"
musictheory,38rz56,Neko_Mesume,4,Sat Jun 6 08:22:25 2015 UTC,"The premise is basically just using the appropriate arpeggios and scales/modes that outline the harmony.  I know that's a pretty reductive answer, but that really is all there is to it.  Also, depending on what you're going for, you can use chromatic approaches to stuff to fill in gaps much the way you might in a walking bass line.  At that point, so long as you're putting the important notes on the right part of the beat, basically notes are available to you.  It's just an issue of highlighting the ones you really want.  If you listen, the strong beats that coincide with the melody are basically creating a harmonized melody if you just played those notes without everything in between.  So if you want to try to do something like this on your own, make a simple melody, then find ways that you can put lots of subdivided notes that make sense between all of your ""melody"" notes.  It's very ""Theme and Variation"" at that point."

musictheory,38rz56,natetet,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"didn't transcribe the piano in detail but here's what I got out of it.   You can essentially ""arpeggiate/riff"" over Dm for most of this. Because of the tempo of the section, you can get away a lot of chromaticism and it still sounds fine.  harmony (roughly): Dm Fmaj9* Bb Am Gm Dm E A  *initially I had this as C but I think I hear an F in the low frequencies. Plus I hear a lot of Am7 (A C E G) outlining in the piano, so Fmaj7 (9) might be a more appropriate way to write this chord.  D E F G A Bb C D - this outlines a D natural minor.  A lot of times the C# is explicitly played to generate tension. C# moving upward into D is a classic resolution used a ton. Try this for example: upward D F A C# D, downward C Bb A G F E A  Over the Dm, F, Bb, Am, and Gm chords you can essentially use notes from that D natural minor scale and you'll be fine.  The E and A have more quirks to them. The Bb is replaced with a B, and the C is replaced with the C# entirely. So you have   D E F G A B C# D - this outlines a D melodic minor  It might be more appropriate to label the overall harmony as E7b9 (HW diminished harmony) and A7 b13. I don't think the G# in the E chord is explicitly played by the piano but it is strongly implied by everything else. Same with the C# for the A chord. I dunno, classical theory people probably can explain this in different terms.  Over both these chords I think the piano is going E-B-E-B-F-B-E-B | E-B-G-B-F-B-E-B  Your analysis may vary.  Anyways, use the harmony as a guide for which tones to key in on to construct arpeggios and riffs.  Dm Fmaj9* Bb Am Gm Dm E A  Dm: D F A  Fmaj9: F A C E G  Bb: Bb D F  Am: A C E  Gm: G Bb D  E: the riff used in the song is relatively simple but you could make more complex lines using the HW diminished scale (E F G G# A# B C# D)  A: again the riff is relatively simple. I would just stick with the 5th mode of the D melodic minor scale (A B C# D E F G). If you wanted to make things more tense you could throw in a Bb. For example, upwards A Bb C# E G, downwards F E C# (and resolve into a D)  An example thought process for riffing over this would be  Dm: D F A D (spell out the triad) F G A Bb (go up the scale)  Fmaj9: A G F (go down the scale) C A E G C (outline the chord)  Bb: D E F Bb (go up the scale) A Bb D Bb (outline the chord)  Am: A G# G F E (go down the scale, add in some chromaticism for fun) C A E (outline the triad)  Gm: D Bb C A Bb G (go down the scale in thirds) G# A (chromatic fun)  E: Bb E F E B E F E (let's keep with the original tune's idea of pivoting)  A: A C# G E (outline an A7 chord) A G F E (down the scale)  just one possible way to do things. the tldr is definitely D natural minor, but add in some different flavor for the E and A chords."

musictheory,38nm7v,Vellss,9,Fri Jun 5 11:23:02 2015 UTC,"Well, you can have tertiary dominant chords too (V/V/V) but at some point it makes more sense to call it a sequence. Also, you can have a collection of chords tonicizing something (ii-V-I/V).   Strictly speaking can have almost any thing on either side of the slash (X/X, x/x, x/X, X/x)  About the only thing you can't have is the tonicization of a diminished or augmented chord (V/iio, or V/III+) because there's really no such thing as a diminished or augmented key (at least not in any music that you'd use roman numerals to analyze)"
musictheory,38nm7v,romericus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:30:09 2015 UTC,"for your last point about diminished and augmented chords--is that really true? i mean, i know there are no diminished keys, etc., but my interpretation of secondary/applied chords and their notation was not that they were moving to a key, just a chord. i mean, obviously the note that's a fifth above the root of each of these chords (dim. and aug.) when you look just at the chord itself is not going to have a dominant function, but i never thought of the secondary chords as needing to be specifically a part of the chord to which they apply, and more that the roman number ""x"" in V/x chord was the chord based on that scale degree, not the key based off that scale degree in the context of the home key. i've never seen a V/III+, either, so in a purely theoretical context, this is interesting. it seems like you would really just put V/III and then have a modification of the III (or iii?) chord when you got to it. maybe i'm misremembering, but i am fairly certain that a viiø /vii is a thing...."
musictheory,38nm7v,bosstone42,2,Fri Jun 5 13:33:13 2015 UTC,"The roman numeral to the right of the slash is indeed referring to a key, and not just a chord.  The slash is short-hand for ""in the key of.""   V/V = V-in-the-key-of-V, because the function of the chord to the left of the slash is to make the chord to the right of the slash sound like tonic, hence tonicization.   Edit: The line between tonicizations and modulations is blurry. Some theorists (mostly Schenkerians) believe that the power and pull of the original tonic really never goes away, so they consider modulations as merely long tonicizations. I see no reason why the opposite could not be true. So it is possible to think of V/V going to V as a two chord modulation to the key of V."
musictheory,38nm7v,romericus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:50:41 2015 UTC,"i guess the problem i have with considering applied chords as relative to a key more than a chord is that with this construction you aren't modulating and the tonicization is so brief that it almost isn't one. i guess my view is one that's schenkerian. the idea that these are more chromatic intermediate chords, to me, makes more sense than an applied chord being applied to a key rather than a chord because the chord it's applied to is often very brief, relatively speaking. modulations take a good amount of time and preparation to establish, but even tonicizations take some time, certainly more than one single chord. for me, that the chord to which an applied chord is applied is still working entirely within the context of its home key's chord syntax (i.e., a IV is still a subdominant, even when its emphasized with a V/IV) indicates that it's a chord first and the applied chord is borrowing from a key rather than establishing that sound in our ears. i think if you group together applied chords, tonicization and modulation as all basically varying degrees of the same thing, then that sort of blurs things too much and, while that is more okay for tonicization and modulation, i think it skews chord function."
musictheory,38nm7v,bosstone42,2,Fri Jun 5 14:30:05 2015 UTC,"But there are tons of possible chromatic intermediate chords that could be used. Why this applied chord specifically as opposed to any other option?  The idea with applied chords is that you're hearing a chord-to-chord succession that sounds idiomatic (or stylistically plausible) because it could occur in a different key. Even without changing our tonal orientation at all, we can recognize a local connection or patch of scalar color that coheres because of its shared pc collection. We identify those collections by their tonics, which is why X/Y doesn't make sense when Y is not a consonant triad."
musictheory,38nm7v,vornska,2,Fri Jun 5 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"Why this applied chord specifically as opposed to any other option?   That question is why I think it's better to think of it as resolving to a chord and not a key, because the specific applied chord you pick leads to a specific chord that makes sense in your home key. If you think of it as resolving to a key (""there are no diminished or augmented keys""), I think that suggests that it could be a tonicization or full modulation, which involves several chords that indicate a key, as opposed to the applied dominant construction, which is just a single chord motion, not several. I'm not saying that the applied dominant construction isn't borrowed from another key or referential of one, because that's indisputable. But I think saying it resolves to a key rather than a chord allows for too much possibility that isn't necessarily relevant.   But I'm also not sure that I would preclude the possibility that an applied chord couldn't lead to, say an augmented triad. Naturally, we expect the applied chord to go to a consonant triad, namely the tonic, and that's where the idea comes from. But there are applied chords that are resolved deceptively (which might seem to contradict what I'm saying, but I think the choice of authentic or deceptive resolution is a choice dependent more on the chord the applied chord resolves to than a decision of a deceptive or authentic cadence). As far as it goes, I think I would see a V/V+ similarly. The voice leading is smooth, so why not? That V+ chord would only be used if that augmented fifth was leading somewhere as part of an altered dominant, which places importance on the actual chord of resolution, not the key the applied construction comes from. That's why for me that thinking of the applied chord as being derived from the key based on the scale degree that your applied chord is from makes sense, but it doesn't necessarily need to resolve to the consonant triad built there, and so thinking of it as resolving to a key rather than a chord doesn't make as much sense to me."
musictheory,38nm7v,bosstone42,2,Fri Jun 5 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"I think we're basically in agreement. I'm not trying to defend the assertion that an applied chord ""resolves to a key"" (do people really say that?), and I definitely agree that a V/V chord could plausibly lead to something like V+ instead of juts V. We'd certainly agree that V/V can lead to V7 which doesn't belong to the key of V.  But when we say ""five of five"" we mean ""five in the key of five"". We're not implying that V/V resolves to the key of V. Rather we're saying that it comes from the key of V even if it resolves to V7 or something else. That's why people say that you can't have V/V+ or something, because there's no scalar context for that to come from. It's not that the V+ chord can't be preceded by an applied dominant, but that the associative context necessary for making sense of the applied chord is the key of V.  Basically, I'm inclined to say that V/V to V+ is a deceptive (or slightly unexpected) resolution of the V/V. The applied chord implies a resolution to V even if that resolution is elided with the introduction of some other dissonant tone."
musictheory,38nm7v,vornska,2,Fri Jun 5 20:03:31 2015 UTC,"right, i think we are. i think i twisted in my mind what was said originally of there being no augmented key as saying that you can't have a V/V+ and that that sequence is not possible, and in so doing, i sort of conflated the derivation with the result, which is a mistake. mea culpa."
musictheory,38nm7v,bosstone42,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:21:41 2015 UTC,"Funny, I consider my view as Schenkerian (though I do no original research in the field, it is the primary lens through which I understand tonal music), and I wholeheartedly believe that applied chords, tonicization and modulation are all basically varying degrees of the same thing.  Yes, it blurs the lines a bit, but it also allows for more flexibility and subtlety of interpretation. And if we didn't have that flexibility and subtlety, it would render music theory almost useless for performance, which IS my main area.  It reminds me of a fascinating article I read once (I think it was by Forte, but don't hold me to that) about the difference between university Schenker and conservatory Schenker. One method is about getting the right answer. The other method is about getting a useful answer."

So for instance, if the first phrase of a piece has a I - IV6/4 - I - V6 - I chord progression, I can be understood to be an expansion of a tonic chord where the IV and V chords really just embellish the tonic chord.

It's probably more common to use the notation with regular dominant seventh chords, though. For example, I - IV - V/ii - ii in C major would be C, F, A7, Dm (since A7 is the dominant chord of the ii chord, Dm). The V chord of C (G or G7) is only used if the V or V7 notation is used.

The bare minimum needed to sound like a full brass section is something like one each of trumpet, trombone and French horn. 4 players - add in a tuba. 5 - add in another horn. Strings is trickier. If they're good, you could just about get away with an ""augmented quartet"" - say, two first violins, one second,  viola and 'cello, but for most ""pit orchestras"" (the smallest ""full"" orchestra you get, used for musicals etc.) , the minumum would be something like 3 firsts, 2 seconds, 1 or 2 violas, 1 or 2 'cellos and a double bass. Of course, if they're amplified and using electronic trickery like chorus and reverb, you can cut that down though."
musictheory,38lvxb,JohnStow,3,Fri Jun 5 08:40:19 2015 UTC,"Full orchestras have four horns if you want all parts filled out. If you're looking for something more like a pit for a musical, one to two horns is typical."

Assuming the strings are mic'd and reverbed you could probably cope with 4 violins, a 2 violas, 2 cellos and a double bass preferably with a low C. More low end is helpful since the strings often have low rhythmic ""chug"" patterns.  Brass will need a bit more variety. Ideally 3+ horns for rips and pad chords. 2 trumpets minimum. 2 trombones and a bass trombone (although more bass trombones are good...) A tuba would be nice but probably not essential. For the secret to that edgy Dimmu Borgir sound you'll need a contrabass trombone, or ideally a cimbasso!  Obviously you could probably get away with less, but I think this is the sort of numbers you'd need for a reasonably full sound."

musictheory,38kj0x,karzyarmycat,23,Thu Jun 4 20:33:53 2015 UTC,"Each key will have very slight timbre differences from one another, as a result of the instruments used (strings, winds, even voice). This is mostly due to the construction of the instrument and where the key falls in its range.  As an example, E Major for guitar uses open fingerings and would sound different from F Major, though it is only a half-step away.  For each given ensemble, keys will have their own feel based on these timbre differences. I think it's mostly up to you as to which key 'feels' the most appropriate for your group."
musictheory,38kj0x,sarkycogs,4,Thu Jun 4 20:43:30 2015 UTC,Is their a chart online which describes the differences in sound?
musictheory,38kj0x,Benjabenja,18,Thu Jun 4 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's so dependant on context that no chart will help. As a massive generalisation strings like sharp keys because they can use more open strings. Brass like flats because the fingerings are usually simpler."
musictheory,38kj0x,climb026,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"Also, on harp, flat keys are more resonant and sharp keys are brighter because of how the pedals work.

musictheory,38kj0x,QueerandLoathinginTO,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:40:40 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the sound directly, but that the performer will play it a little differently.  Open strings sound special in a few ways. On a fretted instrument, there's no risk of fret buzz. They also can't be bent or given vibrato. On a fretless instrument, they eliminate the risk of missing the pitch slightly (on purpose or by accident).  In looser styles than classical, musicians will play open strings as drones, in between the main part of the song. But only to the extent there are useful open strings to drone on.  On piano, different keys fit under the fingers differently. The same tune in different keys will be friendlier to different voicings of the chords."

What stands out about each key which makes it special.   Apart from instruments having resonant sweet spots... A tiny component here might be Equal Temperament messing with the interval spacing. Really though each key is the same, that's the point of them anyway.   I hear people say about harmonics but What exactly are they referring to.    They could be talking about sympathetic resonance being in a range which compliments the resonance of the instrument.   Mostly hear this coming from pianists.    Well the top of a piano is going to behave very differently to the bottom, moving a bit left or right, using different gauge strings, is going to have a subtle impact."
musictheory,38kj0x,tjmusic,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:11:49 2015 UTC,"Would electric instruments have the same affect such as an electric piano would have a certain resonance if the original piano it was sampled from had a ""sweet spot"" or only acoustic instruments...

musictheory,38kj0x,beep_boop_sleep,2,Fri Jun 5 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"With strings, you might play a chord in one place, and an open string sympathetically resonates, move it and the relationship is broken.  On a synth, this actually becomes a bit easier to explain maybe, take the classic 303 resonance chirp, R2D2 voice if you're unfamiliar with it.....   A filter, lets say a low-pass (cutting any frequencies above), with a ""resonance"" control so you can peak the frequency where it cuts (making a frequency response graph which looks like a cliff with a tree standing on it's ledge), then with the right notes the filter itself resonates and produces a tone at the cut-off frequency.   You might have a crackin bassline which has all these fancy high frequency chirps and sparkles in it (produced mainly by the filter and not the main synth oscillating), everytime Bb is hit, but move it to another key and the ""sweet spot"" is gone (until you adjust the cut-off frequency of the filter)."
musictheory,38kj0x,DRL47,3,Fri Jun 5 05:24:01 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, before modern 12TET tuning (which dates to roughly 1850 for common use) differences in temperament caused keys to ""feel"" differently from each other.  Instrument timbre contributed too, as the Boehm system for woodwinds wasn't invented until the 1820s.  As a result, many older books on theory and composition listed the characteristics of keys - here's one system: http://www.wmich.edu/mus-theo/courses/keys.html"

I'm sure there's other reasons, but this is the one my AP teacher told me."

Knowing the instrument intimately, it's possible to know what the note is because of how it sounds on the instrument. Similar to string players being able to hear open strings from a mile away, I can hear a C or an F on the oboe very clearly after listening to a player for a little bit. It's not as though an E is just a semitone lower than an F; it also has a different colour. My friend can take dictation like he had perfect pitch on the oboe.

musictheory,38j967,CrownStarr,3,Thu Jun 4 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, tri-tone substition.  As far as other non-diatonic chords go, in my opinion the best starting place is applied chords. The strength of dominant chords are essential in Western music, and applied chords exploit that strength in a way that's really fun. Basically, an applied chord is a non-diatonic chord that fulfills a dominant function (usually either V7 or viio) for a chord besides the tonic. In other words, if you were in C major, you could take the diatonic chord, ii (Dm), and use the dominant of that chord (A7) to move into the D minor chord in a very powerful way.  TL;DR: Theory is complicated and you should take classes in chromatic harmony. :)  (EDIT: Removed my super-complicated and incorrect classical analysis of a Justin Bieber song.)"

musictheory,38j967,waffletags,2,Fri Jun 5 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"Hi like CrownStarr said, if you consider this as a tritone substitution, you can treat this with equivalent harmonic function as a Fb7 (E7) chord. This is a C# minor piece, so it would be the III7 chord, If you look at the chord before, which is the C# (tonic) followed by Amaj7 (VI chord in minor), the III7 chord makes sense.  Appendix: Tritone substitution is saying that, you can replace a seventh-chord with one that's tritone (augmented 4th/diminished 5th away)  for eg:  C7   =  C E G Bb  F#7 = F# A# C# E  These 2 chords shares E and Bb (A#), thus are very close in terms of harmonic function."

musictheory,38e7gp,nmitchell076,3,Wed Jun 3 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"Peter Schubert has a wonderful presence on video, so I was not surprised to find him participating in this journal.  He has some very lovely YouTube videos about how to improvise canons in the Renaissance style and how to improvise a short theme in the Classical style from some basic starting materials.  I've found these exercises to be incredibly useful in my own teaching.  He also has a video article in the free online journal Music Theory Online that is a little more technical where he discusses some contrapuntal techniques in Frescobaldi.  I should also mention that he is the author of one of the leading series of textbooks on counterpoint in the 16th and 18th century styles.  My response here begins with an overview of my thoughts on the video itself, but I will quickly turn to talking about the series in general, its audience, and its place in the field.  First, the video itself. Schubert reminds me of Scott Burnham in many ways, in that he can make the most familiar pieces and the most elementary concepts sparkle with energy even to those of us who have encountered both numerous times before. So overall, this was an enjoyable video that I am glad I watched and that gave me a new way to think about a passage of music that I know and love. There were a couple of times, however, where I thought he made some odd remarks.  For instance, the bulk of the discussion is on mm. 12-16, which he describes as ""picking up momentum as it moves towards the second theme.""  While there is certainly an increase of momentum, I don't hear it as being directed towards the second theme group yet, but rather towards the I:PAC that concludes the first theme (at 21:48 in the video in the OP), after which a new module launches off the PAC springboard to take us toward the secondary theme area.  This might seem nitpicky, and perhaps it is, but I think it raises an important issue about who the audience is for these videos.  In the last video by Margulis, I felt the audience was a bit unclear: was this geared toward the academic theory community as a whole to act as an introduction to several issues in the subfield of music cognition, or was this aimed at a more general audience who might not be familiar with the field of music theory or the field of cognition?  With this video, the audience becomes more clear, I think: the goal seems to be to produce videos for the wider public that is interested in music theory, rather than for the academic community of theorists themselves.  For a general audience, my remark above about where the energy is directed is nitpicky, it doesn't matter to his overarching point, which is that we have some new color added that Haydn combines with his contrapuntal re-orderings to create an increased sense of forward propulsion.  But it would be less so if the video was intended primarily for scholars of late-eighteenth century music or people dealing with Caplin's theory of formal functions (which is referenced in the abstract but not in the video itself).  I think using this video journal for outreach beyond the music-theoretical world is a very admirable thing to do.  In fact, I think it's very necessary for the growth of our field.  But then I wonder, could this medium also be used to communicate ideas within the field?  That is, could we see videos on SMT-V that become landmark articles in the field of music theory while also being accessible to the broader public?  Some of the work in music theory that I enjoy most does precisely this: offer something new to the field while also being highly accessible to a general audience (things like Scott Burnham's Beethoven Hero, Dmitri Tymoczko's A Geometry of Music, William Caplin's Classical Form, etc.).  All of those are in print mediums, however, so the question of how a video format would navigate that line is interesting to think about.    Another question worth thinking about is the academic prestige of producing such videos. Schubert and Margulis both have tenured positions and have award-winning publications, so they can afford to take the time to produce these videos without worrying about how ""worth it"" it will be to their career. But what about someone seeking a tenured position? How would a publication in this videocast journal look on their CV vs. a print publication?  There may be many people who would love to produce these kinds of videos, but who might wonder whether such a publication would be practically worth their time.  I'm not sure whether we should or should not discuss this point further (because I'm not sure there's anything we could do about it).  I mainly write this last point in the hopes that someone comes along and says ""no, you're dead wrong and here's why...""  Anyway, those are my loose collection of thoughts."
musictheory,38e7gp,bosstone42,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:59:54 2015 UTC,"i like your thoughts on this and i think you touch on a lot of the issues that come up with this sort of project. in terms of the more technical aspect of this video, i was sort of hoping he would do a little explaining how haydn's approach differs from, say, palestrina. and since he's an authority on this stuff, i think he could have managed that pretty concisely. that being said, i really enjoyed the way he describes this aspect of the piece--very accessible and at the same time interesting! for the production of the video, i'm a little unsure why they decided to use these two students as singers. it's convenient, sure, but it's pretty clear neither of them are really accomplished singers (the Bb he has the woman sing wasn't comfortable, it seems, and they didn't exactly nail the pitches). why not just use a couple string players? i don't think the logistics would've been too cumbersome, and if you're going to produce something nice like this, why not take an extra small step?  for the intended audience of this project--wider audience and more publicly functional scholarship is definitely something that is becoming more of a concern. the label ""public musicology"" is gaining currency now, and it encompasses a number of mediums, such as this or blogging or even music criticism. heck, i would go so far as to say that this subreddit is a manifestation of this, in a way. lots of knowledgeable people in conversation with people who are interested and have questions. there was a conference at westminster this past january/february that i think, though i might be mistaken, was the first of its kind, and was meant to bring to light a lot of these thoughts and concerns. (someone tell me if it wasn't, because i would love to know more about these goings on.) related, i was in cincinnati a couple weeks ago, and the may festival/symphony has a partnership with the libraries there to give public presentations on music topics. i got to attend one and it went over incredibly well with a largely 'lay' audience. i was so pleased to see that sort of thing out in the open. i think this type of work (and, in my view, this video indicates the potential of doing more specifically theoretical things...public music theory?) is really important and should be taken more seriously, in part because there's interest out there and in part because i think the life of our fields may some day greatly benefit from efforts like these. i'm not sure what kind of view institutions have on putting these things on a CV, but i've spoken to people who put them under ""contributions to the field"" sort of categories. i think it would be great if there could be a category on a CV/resume for this type of work. just because it isn't ground-breaking (though maybe it is) scholarship doesn't mean it's not interesting/important/good. some of the scholars i respect most are people who produce answers to difficult questions but also speak to the non-specialist well."
musictheory,38e7gp,keakealani,2,Wed Jun 3 18:31:47 2015 UTC,"Neat video! As someone more on the line with the ""general public"" (albeit with a fairly deep interest in theory and college level training under my belt), I agree that this video seemed to simplify some concepts for a more general audience than for a professional music theory audience. (Heck, things like labeling the scale degrees in the diagrams definitely seemed like a nod to ""lay audiences"" since of course music theorists and most professional musicians generally can already hear and recognize those scale degrees.) Not a bad thing, though - I think this subreddit itself is a testament to the broad (and growing) community of people who are interested in music theory, but are not necessarily professional theorists or aspiring professional theorists. (I think we can agree that people with actual graduate degrees in theory are a minority here.)   Anyway, now that it's summer I hope to spend more time with videos like this as well as the articles of the month, but thanks for sharing - this was a nice tidbit in between studying for my French test XD"
musictheory,38gwfy,Batuc,3,Thu Jun 4 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"I see what you're getting at with the correlation between modes and key signatures and the no. of accidentals, It's not really a coincidence but it's kind of irrelevant because when we talk about something having a flat or a sharp it's always in relation to how the pitch classes differ from the major scale of the same root note, so of course a lot of them line up, however you can't see the same pasterns occur if you were to base it off of any other key.  When discussing modes with beginners i've always found it preferable to refer to minor/major/diminished/augmented intervals rather than flats and sharps to avoid this mix up. Not only do you automatically differentiate mode from key, but you also get some kind of inkling of the tonality of modes. e.g a major scale w/ a min7 for mixolydian and so on."
musictheory,38gwfy,Leodhas,3,Thu Jun 4 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"Starting from C, each degree has the same number of accidentals in their key signature than the modes but with flats instead of sharps ( Ionian and C have none, D and Dorian have respectively two sharps and two flats, E and Phrygian four sharps and flats, F and Lydian one flat and one sharp, etc.)   Um, what?  Try looking at it from a single pitch center:  C Lydian - C D E F# G A B  C Ionian (C major) - C D E F G A B  C Mixolydian - C D E F G A B♭  C Dorian - C D E♭ F G A B♭  C Aeolian (C Minor) - C D E♭ F G A♭ B♭  C Phrygian - C D♭ E♭ F G A♭ B♭  C Locrian - C D♭ E♭ F G♭ A♭ B♭  As you go down the list, another note gets lowered (flattened) from the previous one. This relates to the circle of fifths, as the relative major scales of all of those are successively a fifth apart."

At my school they always showed modes starting from the degree they represent based on C (Ionian: C D E F G A B, Dorian: D E F G A B C, Lydian F G A B C D E etc.) so no mode ever had any flat or sharp note.  If I understand correctly, what you showed me is that by using the circle of fifths I can follow the order of sharps and flats to know which note to flatten. Is that it?  Ex: G (key signature is F#)  G Lydian -G A B C# D E F#(I would follow the order of # to add C#) G Ionian - G A B C D E F# G Mixolydian - G A B C D E F G Dorian - G A Bb C D E F (I would use the order of flats from there)  etc."

musictheory,38gwfy,tjmusic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:27:10 2015 UTC,"Here's the why:  You have a bunch of modes related to C - C Ionian, D Dorian, E Phrygian, etc.  Each one of those starts on a scale degree.  If you build a major scale degree on any note, you get a certain number of accidentals in the key signature.  Start from D, and you have two sharps.  If you have a mode related to C major, you have zero sharps or flats.  If you start from some degree other than C, building a major scale will have some number of sharps (or one flat, if you start from F).  To get back to a mode of C, you'd need to get back to zero.  So it's not theory, it's math.... x + y = 0 only when y = -x"
musictheory,38gob7,xiipaoc,4,Thu Jun 4 02:15:46 2015 UTC,"In most situations I prefer a single 8th followed by a beamed pair.    However, it depends on how you are beaming the rest of the piece.  If you are beaming 8th notes in groups of 4, then your 3 pickup notes should be beamed together.    If you are beaming 8th notes in groups of 2, then do it the way I suggested (single 8th plus beamed pair).    Your decision to beam 8ths in groups of 2 or 4 has to do with tempo and ""feel.""  By default I think 4/4 should be beamed in groups of 2-eighth notes, but if the tempo is fast and/or it has a cut-timey sort of feel, then grouping eighths in 4 may be appropriate.    It's not an exact science and neither choice would be ""wrong,"" so don't deliberate too much over it.

musictheory,38gob7,PullTheOtherOne,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would not include the 8th rest, because I wouldn't beam the 3 8ths together in the first place.

In a sight-reading session it could be easy to misinterpret this as a triplet, or simply to start on a ""downbeaty"" feel instead of an ""upbeaty"" feel.  I've seen happen -- recently in fact, with a professional musician subbing in for a gig.    If a composer/arranger insists on beaming a pickup this way, I would advise including an 8th rest as a subtle reminder.    However, I would really, really advise beaming this pickup as a lone 8th plus a beamed pair, which is unmistakable.   I'm a big proponent of beaming in beat groups, and I don't like beaming 8ths in groups of 4 unless I'm going for a cut-time kind of feel.

musictheory,38gbgu,Xenoceratops,2,Thu Jun 4 02:23:53 2015 UTC,"To speak in more practical terms, I once had a bandleader who organized music into two basic groups: songs and dances. I'll start with dances, since they are less abstract. Dances are guttural. Dances are anything that has a strong rhythm and makes you move. This could be anything from a court dance to a military march. Songs are lyrical and are meant to be listened to more than they are to be danced to. Songs are cerebral, and are often linked to poetry. An example would be a ballad, which tells a story. A lullaby is meant to send a child to sleep. A serenade is meant to woo a lover. An elegy or a threnody is a mournful song that eulogizes the dead.  Perhaps this dichotomy will help you to form some ideas. You could maybe have your party dance a tarantella to cure spider bites. Go wild.  In Indian classical music, certain ragas (the scale and melodic structure upon which music is built) have magical properties. You might look into how those are described. One such raga is raga deepak, which produces heat and fire. Raga malhar produces rainfall, by contrast. The potential for something like that in fantasy role play is obvious."

For example, a 13 chord contains all notes of a scale which when stacked sequentially in 2nds will sound like a mess (an effect which does have it's place). However, when voiced in 3rds, or with notes removed/octave displaced it will usually sound far better."
musictheory,38d1fx,Benjabenja,2,Thu Jun 4 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"For voicing, it's important to remember that though a chord is functionally the same in any inversion, it does clearly sound different in different inversions. In fact, often we latch onto certain notes within progressions (which can be what make progressions work well) and if you can bring these important notes out it can sound really good. You can create stronger progressions as well as almost melodies within progressions by inverting chords.   An example might be a progression like C - Am - F - G. If you want the chords to transition smoothly in the high end, you could invert Am so the third (C) is on top and F so the fifth (C) is on top, as well as G so the third (B) is on top. This gives you C - C - C - B as your top notes, which have no leaps or skips in the high end and transition smoothly.   Alternatively, using the same progression if you wanted a sort of sub melody that changes with the chords, you could invert them so the melody is on top. As an example, we might use the notes G - A - F - D as our melody and invert each chord so the note we want is on top."

That's the problem.  What you're talking about is generally known as a tritone substitution (tritone sub for short), which is when you have a dominant 7th and you replace it with the dominant 7th a tritone away.  In your case, the dominant is G7 (V7 of C minor), which is spelled G B D F, and you replace it with a Db7, which is spelled Db F Ab Cb, or, enharmonically, Db F Ab B, and you resolve it the same way -- that is, to Cm.  You can even think of the Db7 as a G7b5b9 without a root, if you really want to.  I understand how you might want to call this ""sub V"", since you're literally substituting the V chord, but the generally understood term is ""tritone substitution"", since you're substituting the chord by another chord whose root is a tritone away.  As for the ""double sub"", I'm guessing that it's context-specific -- there's some piece of music you're looking at where two different substitutions happen and your teacher said it's a ""double sub"".  It could be, for example, two tritone substitutions in adjacent chords.  For example, a common cadence is V7/V - V7 - I (in C, that would be D7 - G7 - C).  Both of these are dominant chords (the D7 is the secondary dominant to G, in this case), so you can apply a tritone substitution to both of them and have Ab7 - Db7 - C.  Someone might say that this is a ""double sub"".  As far as I know, ""double sub"" doesn't have a standard meaning.  I could be wrong!"

First of all, thank you for taking your time to educate me here. I think my teacher meant tritone sub. I'm going to confirm with him next lesson. I just tried to do everything you said on the comment. i came to a conclusion.  G7 guide tones are F B. and Db guide tones are B F.  i will get back to you later i just tried G7 -Db7 - Cmaj, G7 -Db7 - Cminor.  haha work like a magic.   but here is one thing in the song, me and my teacher sort of agreed that, at Db,  (F,Ab,B),which is a dominant 7, is a bit too strong. and (F,Ab,C), which is maj 7, fits better. more smooth, in-sounding. Do you feel the same way?  by the way I'm going to comment more when i come back i just gotta leave now. thank you!"

musictheory,38ehlj,Scal3s,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:18:28 2015 UTC,"First of all, the ""guide tones"" of Db7 are actually F and Cb, not F and B.  The thing about the tritone sub is that it enharmonically respells the Cb as B, since the F and B actually function as F and B, not F and Cb.  In other words, Db7 should actually be Db(+6).  But this is more of a technical point here, I guess.  Now, do I feel that bIImaj7 is better than bII7 here?  Eh.  Maybe.  I honestly don't like the tritone sub very much, do bIImaj7 could be nice.  I actually prefer going the other way -- bII(add6), which is really more of a bvii7 in first inversion.  For that matter, bvii(add6) is good too, which is a vø7 in inversion (first or second both work here).  I don't particularly like those guide tones.  That's just me.  I think a much better active tritone is b2 - 5 resolving to 1 - 5.  I think this puts me at odds with most jazz musicians, personally, but I'm OK with that.  Basically, and I think you agree here, is that b2 and 7 together are way too much pressure towards the 1, not to mention that they're out of the key in an odd way.  b2 and 7 are both leading tones.  You don't need either of them, but the b2 is a hell of a lot more interesting than the 7 if you want one of them.  In music in the phrygian or phrygian dominant modes, that b2 is very natural, and the 7 is not.  But hey, people like the tritone sub and presumably they like it for a reason!"
musictheory,38arwu,dylanthepiguy2,15,Wed Jun 3 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"Is there a table of different features for each mood?   lol It would be amazing if there were such a thing. I know there's a table by Schumann describing his feeling of the different moods that music written in different keys evokes. Of course, it's wildly subjective and ultimately meaningless, as is any such absolute statement on which exact thought-patterns create a genuine emotional reaction in an audience.  As far as how an art form is able to express psychological, emotional, and spiritual concepts- this is pretty deep question, one that doesn't have a convenient answer beyond the fact that music is a language. While certain rules of grammar govern many aspects of musical logic and style, the same rules don't create art in the same way that being able to diagram a sentence doesn't make one a poet.   Artistic creativity is a kind of emergent process that arises out of a mostly sub-conscious understanding of the deep levels of structural function in a language or thought-system. When you hear the clever wordsmithing of a great rapper, lyricist, comedian, orator, there's usually a kind of play on the general expectations of the listener- something out of the ordinary of commonplace speech and ideas. There's an awareness of the various patterns going on simultaneously, where they fit in, and where they can alter the pattern without destroying the fabric. They understand on an intuitive level- how the game works, what the rules are, and how to get away with making their own rules.  Is there some magic power these artists have? Probably. Is there some way you can gain such ability? Maybe. Is there a step-by-step process to attaining it? Doubtful.   All I really know is that gaining mastery of any art form takes an enormous amount of time, energy, and passion. If you genuinely want a deep connection with music, you need to dive deeply into it.  The qualities necessary are: Courage, Perseverance, Discipline, Curiousity, Intelligence, Awareness, Sensitivity, Open-Mindedness, Open-Heartedness. If you possess these in heroic proportions, just about anything is possible."

I wouldn't call it a language, as language is symbolic (thus if I say tree, you think of a specific tree, all kinds of trees, etc). Music is not like this; it works directly within us.

And if that sonic event was then an element in a musical work, couldn't we say that there is a symbolic element to the music?   For instance, if I am exposed to the descending 3rd with a bell timbre consistently in the context of a doorbell. Then doesn't the sound of the descending third with a bell-like timbre become symbolic of a doorbell? Could you imagine someone having no word for doorbell, but only referring to the idea of the doorbell using a descending third and imitating a bell timbre with their voice (perhaps using the sounds ""ding"" and ""dong"" in the process)? And in yet another situation, could I use the descending 3rd ""ding dong"" to mean ""hello""? To use that combination of interval and timbre to communicate a piece of information to someone else.   And wouldn't this person, listening to the opening musical number of ""The Book of Mormon"" be able to carry this symbolic association into their musical experience? Couldn't we say that the music says ""hello"" twice, once when the word ""hello"" is spoken by the singer, but also at the initial ringing of the doorbell?   If music is not like a language, I don't think it is because music cannot be a symbol of something. There's nothing special about our current group of human languages that allows them and only them to convey symbolic information."

If you are hearing sound in reference to anything but the sound then you are diluting the experience. I'll admit that listening in this way (without referring to objects, other recordings, etc) is incredibly difficult, yet I think it is incredibly rewarding. It opens you up to a true experience, one in which the sounds connect directly to you.  It is entirely possible to relate sounds to objects, emotions, etc, but I think this can detract from the experience."
musictheory,38arwu,maestrothrowaway,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"Do you think that, going back to the ""Book of Mormon"" example, you gain something by forgetting that that descending third bell sound is connected in our collective memories to the doorbell sound? If you do gain something, do you also lose something? It seems like the fact that we are hearing a doorbell is kind of the point of using that gesture, and to ""forget"" about that is to sort of miss out on something. In other words, it seems like in some cases that connection between sonic object and memory is crucial to the musical experience. I do think there are cases where, as you describe, it might be more fruitful to try to sever that sort of link. But in other cases, as in the piece I linked, that link can be a crucial part of the musical meaning. We might find analogues in earlier music in various musical topics that are deployed such as the use of hunting horns as a ""special effect"" to deliberately evoke a hunting topic, etc."

Same would go for painting (brush techniques vs the final outcome), creative writing as you've mentioned... and, it most certainly applies to music. There are rules that help achieve compelling melody like the intervals you use or the mood of the different modes within a song. Some cadences and progressions can give the listener a very predicable feel, which is largely all theory and rule based. But when someone has the creative thinking and sensitivity to abstract ideas to tap into a language train of throught by using music, it is very noticeable.

In this article there is a useful ranking of ""edginess"" of the intervals.  I recently listened to a song with a melody with an incredible amount of ""apocalyptic"" tension and spend my time analyzing why it was created. The solution was that it consisted of lots of rather dissonant intervals. The same is true for music that sounds ""creepy"". I think that dissonant intervals really only sound ""bad"" if you play them at once, but can be really interesting in a melody."
musictheory,38arwu,not_sane,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:27:26 2015 UTC,"Do a bit of dissection on the ""Mannerism"" prelude that you posted.  Notice the staccato articulations, the leapy bass, the transparency of texture (only two voices), generally light dynamics, and the activity level of each voice.  Each voice is moderately active, but neither is burdened with virtuosic scale runs or arpeggios.  These things all contribute to the character of the piece.  Other folks seem to be suggesting things in terms of harmony but I think that the mood and character achieved in this piece could be done with several different kinds of harmonic palettes."
musictheory,38arwu,tnova,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:45:09 2015 UTC,I agree. The harmony isn't so much of a factor beacuse of the light texture. It's quite easy to get away with smooth chromaticisms with only two voices (like the Db in the first few bars) because the weird chord progression isn't so strongly defined like there would be with three voices or more. I'll do some more work on it and try to find other pieces too
musictheory,38arwu,Bassilo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"Mood is such a subjective thing.  I think of it this way: it is well documented that popular music is used in interrogation and psychological torture techniques used by the United States Government (and I assume other Countries).  I can't remember where I read this, but Brittney Spear's ""hit me baby"" was played over and over again to thwart Somali Pirate attacks.  I think that the amount of scales that exist in the world (inside and outside equal temperament situations) demonstrate the wide variety in the spacing of intervals to create consonant melodies, but what constitutes ""consonant"" is highly variable.  Pelog music is really dissonant to western ears, but to people in Indonesia it is ""beautiful"" (the meaning of the word pelog).  There are many cultural, socio-economic, etc factors that contribute to mood, but I would say that intervals and scales contribute a lot to the mood of music.  Also instrumentation/timbre of the instruments used is important.  If you are trying to emulate Mannerism  I would pay attention to the intervals used in certain parts of the song.  If a cluster or series of notes say in the 2nd measure, for example, create a certain mood for you, write down what that chord is, or what intervals are used etc.  I think mood is largely based on your listening background.  Some of the most beautiful pieces of music to me are ugly and atonal for other people.  I'm just rambling now, hope this helps."
musictheory,38arwu,JakeGiovanni,2,Thu Jun 4 23:02:54 2015 UTC,I once read a book on psychology of music and I think maybe I can sum up some basics off the top of my head.  Major key= happy  Minor key= sad.  Increases in volume and/or pitch= excitement.  Increases in tempo or speed (100 BPM to 140 BPM or a snare playing every 1/4 to every 1/8) = excitement  Hard velocity (smashing piano keys) = excitement  Soft velocity (gently playing) = content or sad.  People generally find orchestral strings to be classically content or theatrically exciting with the exception of obviously sad pieces (Mr Krabs tiny violin)  People tend to get bored after hearing the same thing once or twice. The book I read offered several remedies to this both subtle (like changing chords/notes subtly to sound ever so slightly different) and apparent (like changing patterns completely) I can't go too in depth off the top of my head.  Hope this helps.

musictheory,38arwu,ShittyProducer,2,Wed Jun 3 06:26:16 2015 UTC,"often times when something is looped there is very subtle variation. I will combine very slight and slow changes in volume and tone and even timing of certain notes (like, less than 16ths) to keep something that is the same as it's previous repetition sounding fresh.

musictheory,38arwu,JakeGiovanni,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:28:47 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading the book regardless!  That point walks a very fine line. Obviously almost every song changes in some way whether it be vocals, percussion or some other element.  But the point he mainly made is that if you have a piano piece with the same 4 chords and melody repeating, the reader will likely lose interest after 4 or 8 times of hearing it.  But what if you inverted the chords on the second play through? It's the same chords yet it sounds slightly different. That's once example he gives.  The biggest every day example I can give is electronic music. If you listen to any electronic song. If you to Deadmau5's ""Animal Rights"" the song starts off with a basic 1/4 kick drums. It's pretty bare, very boring. But most producers do this to allow songs to be mixed when being playing live. So to keep it interesting, on the next 16 bars, he adds a (for lack of a better term) WUB to the end of every 4 bars.    A big point he stressed is **not to overkill something. Keep the song constantly changing in a minor way and a big change every once in a while (like between verses, choruses, bridges)  If he didn't, most people would stop listening  long before the actual ""song"" came.  For one last example, I produced a song a while back that was great. A lot of people I showed loved. It was literally the same piece being played over and over. But I kept changing it. Rose cutoff levels on filters, slowly introduced basses, eventually there was a surge in reverb and I brought in a subtle violin sound and a 1/4 kick. To keep it interesting the kick was 1/8 on the last beat of every 8th bar. [mightve been 16th]) but yeah. Minor details like cutoff frequencies, big details like introducing bass and percussion."

You can go F to Bb diminished 7 to B major, as the Bb diminished 7 is a secondary diminished chord to B major. Remember that for any good chord progression you need some sort of pre-tension, tension, and resolution on the homekey of the new chord. Tons of ways to get there.

The transition from G# to B, or from a major chord to another major chord a minor third away, is a fairly common transitional chord progression. It also sounds pretty cool. Alternatively, you can change the 1/2 measure F chord to a 1/2 major F# major chord. F# -> B, the most basic of cadences.  If you're willing to add an entire section between the two though, then there's a lot of different (and fun) ways you can approach it. I immediately thought of this, which actually switches between F major to B major and back to F major for the entire piece."
musictheory,38akzz,Arathun,2,Wed Jun 3 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"Another option is a sequential modulation, where you use a motif/hook/melody that happens in F and then repeats in B so the familiar material acts as the anchor for the listener.  You can use that technique to go from F directly to B, or you can throw another key in there with the same melody repeated to make the transition a little longer and less sudden (for example, playing the hook in F, then Amaj, then Bmaj and going on in Bmaj from there).  I'm all about video game music, so if you look up the track called JENOVA from the game Final Fantasy VII you'll see an obvious example of what I'm talking about.

Although the pedal tone Ab (drone) helps keep things ""grounded"" for the most part, the alternating C's and Cb's create a bit of modal ambiguity throughout (major vs. minor, etc.).   The cue begins with I - bIII - IV (in the key of AbM: Abmaj - Cbmaj - Dmaj), and continues a similar progression up until 0:40. We arrive at another IV chord (Dbmaj) at 0:40, back to a bIII (Cbmaj) at 0:42, and then to the ""really dissonant chord"" you speak of (at 0:44), which, as it turns out, isn't all that dissonant alone: bii chord (Bbbmin; or, enharmonically ""Amin""). Of course, in the context of the key of Ab, a Bbbmin chord (or, rather, Amin) DOES sound dissonant (i.e. non-diatonic, etc.), but the proper voice-leading allows a smooth transition back to a Dbmaj (IV) chord: the C (or Dbb) resolves upward to Db; the A (or Bbb) resolves downward to Ab), etc. Now, to round out the rest of passage: From the Dbmaj (IV) at 0:47, back to Cbmaj (bIII) at 0:49, next to bII (Bbbmaj) at 0:51, and finally arriving at an open Db chord (no third) at 0:54.

musictheory,38ab58,explosion_sauce,3,Tue Jun 2 23:11:10 2015 UTC,"It differs in the sense that a progression in G will sound different than one in Em, but when composing you should feel free to transition between them if you want since they have the same notes.   The only thing that defines whether it's in G or Em in this case is the root chord, so whichever one you focus on and lead to will determine the key. This only holds true for as long as you continue to focus on that chord. Many songs are in both G and Em in different parts."
musictheory,38ab58,Morgoth714,2,Wed Jun 3 00:11:32 2015 UTC,"A song in Em will tend to build tension and then resolve to Em. A song in G will tend to build tension and resolve to G. There are definitely songs that have ambiguous tonality.  The minor song may use the Melodic and Harmonic modifications to the Natural Minor scale, which will introduce notes to the key that are not shared by the relative major. For example, in the natural minor scale, the chord built on the 4th degree is minor, but in the melodic minor scale, the 4th degree is major. Harmonic and melodic are alterations to the natural minor scale that help create pleasant voice leading, and they are assumed to be available when you say simply, ""E minor"", instead of, ""E natural minor"".  Whether you run into walls in your composition depends a lot on your desire for the composition. Remember that music theory is primarily descriptive, not prescriptive. Write a chord progression that sounds like you want it to sound, then, if you like, think about what key it is in. But don't set out to write a progression in G and then wonder whether you've violated some tenet by emphasizing Em too much (unless it's an assignment for a music theory class, that is).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0c5CxzO3lk  EDIT: For example, here is a backing track in Am. The track contains an E7 chord. If you build an E chord out of the notes of A natural minor = C major, you get Em. Harmonic minor raises the 7th degree 1/2 step to improve the voice leading back to the root, so you get an E major instead of minor. If you play the same progression using Em, listen to the difference in tension and resolution as you move back to the root. With an Em, there just isn't any tension on that chord, and the progression moves to the root much less definitively."

musictheory,3877hw,howiedoon,22,Tue Jun 2 10:14:44 2015 UTC,"This is not figured bass notation. It is a standard form of notating chord inversion in roman numeral analysis. It derives from the old tradition of figured bass, but it is not the same thing.   When a contemporary theorist describes a ""C Major, chord of the Sixth"" they generally mean a C Major harmony (Tones C-E-G) with the 3rd (E) in the bass. The nomenclature is confusing because the 3rd and 6th are not related to the given ""root"", in this case 'C.' The intervals relate to the actual sounding bass, 'E.' The 3rd is the 'G' above 'E' and the 6th is the 'C' above. A more comprehensible notation would simply be [I over 3] in the Key of C, or as jazz/pop arrangers write: C/E.   Why the confusing notation then? It largely has to do with a partially incompatible mash-up of two different thought processes: the ancient method of figured bass/thorough bass/basso continuo- as practiced by Handel and Bach, and the new method of Rameau and the ""Fundamental Bass""--or the Root and Inversion system.  In an actual figured bass, the numerals signify the intervals to be added above the bass. For example, 6/5 means to add the intervals of a 3rd, 5th, and 6th above the notated bass note. Over the course of a bass line, figured bass intervals show voice-leading, not necessarily harmony.  There's a very big conceptual difference in understanding contrapuntal interval change through figured bass, and our more contemporary thought process of thinking in terms of ""chord changes."" One isn't more right or wrong, but they are certainly distinct.   A figured bass theorist would not necessarily equate a Sixth chord on the bass tone 'E' with a C Major triad, as the actual sonority of a minor third and minor sixth above a bass is much different than the sonority of a major third and perfect 5th, regardless of whether they share the same notes. In the contrapuntal style, the idea of a chord being theoretically derived from a basic triad is much less relevant than the actual motion of the individual lines through voice leading."

musictheory,3877hw,ouselesso,-1,Tue Jun 2 10:49:20 2015 UTC,"To add to the previous commenters, it's important to know where figured bass actually comes from. Let's say we're in C major. The V6 chord, as you said, is the dominant chord in first inversion. So it's a G major over B. Why is it that though?  Well, music theorists gave shorthand notation for some figured bass symbols. V6 is actually V63, but it's faster to write V6 so they just use that. What does V63 mean? It means intervals above the bass note. So in the V63 chord (G major over B), the bass note is B, and then we look at a third and a sixth above B, which are D and G respectively. And there you go, B, D, G, a G major chord in first inversion!  I64 is the same way. In C major, the I chord in 2nd inversion has G in the bass, and a fourth and sixth above the bass are C and E, respectively. G, C, E, a C major chord.  V65 is another shorthand. Its full expansion is actually V653. Now try figuring out what those notes are. Hope that helps!"
musictheory,3877hw,mazegeek999,6,Tue Jun 2 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"This isn't figured bass though, it's just a roman numeral analysis. Figured bass, or through bass, was used heavily throughout the Baroque era to make it easier for composers to have a creative way for improvising the harmony. Figured bass would only give inversions and a starting note, with no harmony. It would never say something was to be tonic or dominant, etc. It's up the performer to improvise the music, creating the dissonance and tension. It's a huge part of the shift in music from the Renaissance style to the Baroque, how they treat harmony, especially the use of dissonance."

musictheory,3877hw,ouselesso,0,Tue Jun 2 20:21:30 2015 UTC,Figured bass DOES give the harmony. It tells you exactly what chord to play and in what inversion. The only improvising is in the voicing. It is exactly like using a chord chart in modern music.
musictheory,3877hw,DRL47,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"False, it provides no context on what type of chords to play. It simply provides cues, it's up the performer to create the realization of the figured bass. This is improvised music, akin to Jazz.  Edit: I think you may be confusing this with Basso continuo, which does provide the harmony, giving just a bass note and indicated inversion. The harmony is then filled with other instrument/voices."

First, THERE IS NO BASS!  While you can back into what the bass line would be by reverse engineering the Roman numerals, figured bass REQUIRES a written bass.  Without a bass line, what can you possibly be figuring from?    Second, in figured bass there is no notation used for a root position triad - if there's no figure, root position is assumed.  So in a figured bass, there wouldn't be any notations at all for mm. 1, 6, 7, 9, 14 or 16.  Just the bass note would be sufficient.  Third, figured bass doesn't use Roman numerals, because it doesn't need them.  With the figure and the bass you know exactly what the chord is, and consequently its position in relation to the tonic."
musictheory,384oh4,l_davies93,37,Mon Jun 1 20:52:23 2015 UTC,"There isn't really a difference. I'll try to explain as best I can why Kind of Blue might sound a bit not centred to you, as I wrote my dissertation on 1959 in Jazz and this came up a fair bit.  WARNING: This is pretty long.  So Miles Davis made a comment to theorist George Russell about ""wanting to learn all the changes"" in about 1953. A throwaway comment - he knew how to play them. He was just looking for a different way to play jazz. He was bored with the apparent stagnation in bebop that focused on endless hurdles of constantly changing chords to navigate as furiously quickly as possible. So, he looked to reduce harmonic activity.  Russell reconceptualised how Davis - and others - looked at the relationship between the horizontal and the vertical (melody and harmony). So he basically came up with the first chord-scale system in relation to improvisation: i.e. what scale can you play to fit over a certain chord? A simple example, 12 bar blues in A. Either you play an A blues scale over the whole thing, or on the chords A D and E (I IV and V) you play A mixolydian, D mixolydian, and E mixolydian.   This was called the Lydian Chromatic Concept (the example mentioned isn't in there as far as I can recall, and it's full of ""unreadably turgid discourse"" to quote Darius Brubeck), and basically was the only original music theory to come out of jazz.  Previously, in bebop and before, only four sorts of scales were used: major, minor, Mixolydian mode, blues scale - and also chord arpeggiation.* (Edit: this is according to Ingrid Monson in the Cambridge Companion to Jazz) Bebop added wholetone and diminished scales. This was over ""all the chords"" basically. Nowadays, jazz convention is to say ""what scales can we use on this ONE chord?"".  To get back to Davis, I'm gonna focus on just So What - he hung the entire tune around a D dorian. (And then the one chord change to Eb dorian). It's simple. It's cool. It's jazz stripped RIGHT back. Just all the white notes on the piano, between D and D, in what is a fairly unfamiliar sound world (given we're so used to major and minor).  Another reason why it sounds like there isn't a fixed key - Bill Evans' miracle voicing (to use the name Frank Mantooth gave it). This is the EADGB voicing (bottom five strings of a standard guitar tuning, in fact), and works as five different chords depending on which of those white notes is at the bottom. It's an unstable, magical chord. Mark Levine in his book on Jazz Piano devotes two chapters. It's such a big dog of a chord that it has its own Wikipedia page.  So, um, to not really answer your question, and to open up a massive can of worms, here's an insight that I hope helps explain theoretically and vaguely why So What for instance sounds like how it does.  Really really sorry, might go over your head. Don't know how to pitch these things. I hope not though!"
musictheory,384oh4,PadstheFish,5,Mon Jun 1 23:47:38 2015 UTC,"You seem to know a fair bit about the LCC, can you clarify something for me? What's the difference between the system of chord scales, matching a scale up to a chord, and just filling chord tones in with passing tones? What does conceptualizing it as a separate scale system do for the theory? After all, people have been filling in chord tones with stepwise passing motion for centuries, but we don't tend to say ""Oh, Farinelli played a mixolydian scale over that V7"" when talking about an opera aria. So what is new in this respect in the LCC? Why does the system of modes get emphasized so much in one system, while a similar cultural practice doesn't get conceptualized as a mode, but rather as just passing motion filling out chord tones? They seem similar, but are talked about from different standpoints, which is weird."
musictheory,384oh4,nmitchell076,2,Tue Jun 2 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"I suppose that, well, there isn't really that much of a difference between chord-scale systems (of which the LCC is one of many) and just using passing tones.  The key difference in my view at least is that the LCC was the first thing to articulate, codify and theorise a method for choosing a scale. Furthermore, re the Farinelli thing - jazz completely recontextualised the practice of improvisation. So it was a field not limited simply to passing notes. You have a variety of scales and licks to choose from - even in the bebop era, to an extent. Not all motion in jazz improvisation is stepwise.  I think the key difference with the LCC was basically that it was the first to ""say it"". Just to quote the same thing again from an answer below:  ""... Within [the major scale’s] seven tones lies the most fundamental harmonic progression of the classical era... the tonic major chord on C... the sub-dominant major chord on F... the dominant seventh chord on G – thus, the major scale resolves to its tonic major chord. The Lydian scale is the sound of its tonic major chord.""  This is ""original, brilliant, even self-evident, but no-one had quite said it before"" (Brubeck, Cambridge Companion to Jazz, 192).  ""Why does the system of modes get emphasized so much in one system, while a similar cultural practice doesn't get conceptualized as a mode, but rather as just passing motion filling out chord tones? They seem similar, but are talked about from different standpoints, which is weird.""  Forgive me, but I think you're basically asking someone to explain the essence of jazz here - which is improvisation. Jazz has its roots in oral tradition (of course, by 1959 you've had big bands, Davis and Gil Evans and all etc etc), so improvisation has always been a key part of artistic expression. As for passing motion - I have to stress, that is not all that improvisation is.  I don't think I know quite enough to articulate myself properly (especially as I've just woken up) but I hope this helps!"

musictheory,384oh4,JazzRider,8,Mon Jun 1 21:35:41 2015 UTC,"There are differences between modes and scales, but you really have to be using those words in specific contexts for that difference to make sense.  Oftentimes, ""mode"" implies specific melodic patterns, while ""scale"" just refers to the notes used.  For example, on Shabbat morning, Ashkenazic nusach (prayer chanting) is in the Ahavah Rabbah mode, which largely (but not exclusively) uses the phrygian dominant scale.  ""Mode"" can also refer to a new scale that contains the same notes as another scale but has a different tonic.  For example, phrygian dominant is the fifth mode of harmonic minor, because the phrygian dominant scale is what you get when you play the notes of harmonic minor starting on the fifth one.  BUT, as far as you're concerned, there is no difference between scales and modes.  They're exactly the same thing.  The mixolydian mode and the mixolydian scale, for example, refer to exactly the same structure in exactly the same way.  Now, what do modes mean in jazz?  Actually, they mean something different.  The idea is really to think of a scale instead of a chord.  So if you're in, say, C major and you see D-7 G7 C∆, you look at the chords and think D dorian, G mixolydian, C ionian.  Actually, you can be in any other key; in modal jazz, you'll see D-7 G7 C∆ and realize that, for right now, you're in C major, no matter where you were before.  D-7 is the D dorian scale.  D-7b9 is the D phrygian scale.  C∆#11 is the C lydian scale.  They're basically 7-note chords, and as a jazz musician, you can play almost any of those 7 notes.  (Actually, you can play whatever the fuck you want, but those 7 notes are the ones that sound most like how you probably want them to sound.)"

(Actually, you can play whatever the fuck you want, but those 7 notes are the ones that sound most like how you probably want them to sound.)   There are a lot of different ways to explain modes, but this one is novel to me, so thanks for it. I'm aware of the relationship between chords and modal scales in the sense of taking the chords of a song and backing out to what mode you can use to play a melody over the chords. I hadn't ever thought before of chords as being stacked notes from a modal scale, though. Rather, I would think, ""This song is in such-and-such a key, so the notes of that scale are what is used to build the chords."" You've flipped it around the other way. That especially makes sense in jazz, where the tonal center of a song can change, sometimes within a single measure, and you'll never get away with soloing in a single scale/mode/key."

musictheory,384oh4,tjmusic,5,Mon Jun 1 21:24:36 2015 UTC,So why is the use of modes so important and why does it lead to the unique sound of modal jazz?
musictheory,384oh4,Flebberflep,14,Mon Jun 1 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"It's the change in tonic that makes all the difference. You can try it yourself.  Start with a major scale, and play the first note continuously while playing the scale. This is the first mode.  Next, play the second note of the scale continuously while playing the same scale over the top. This is the second mode, with the second note of the scale being the tonic.  You can continue this with every note in the scale, and this change in tonic is what makes the modes what they are. It's a relationship between the scales."

musictheory,384oh4,elyisgreat,4,Tue Jun 2 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"A scale is a series of notes. The standard scale uses the formula +2+2+1+2+2+2+1. A mode is an inversion (modulation) algorithm of a scale that produces new scales by ""rotating"" the original.   General much? Ok. Another way to think about it is that the scale is the ""do re mi fa so[l] la ti"" part, and the mode determines the tonic. For example, the C Dorian scale is the scale where the tonic is re and re is equal to C. This gives the notes C,D,Eb,F,G,A,Bb, the same notes as the Bb major scale. F# Phrygian, for example, is the scale where the tonic is mi and mi is equal to F#, yielding F#,G,A,B,C#,D,E. These are the modal names:  Ionian (major): Tonic do Dorian: Tonic re Phrygian: Tonic mi Lydian: Tonic fa Mixolydian: Tonic so[l] Aeolian (natural minor): Tonic la Locrian: Tonic ti  Getting even more specific:   However, when listening to ""Kind of Blue"" it sounds like there sometimes isn't a fixed key and I was wondering if this ever changing sound may be a result of the use of modes.   I don't know this song. If you could give me a link that would be great and I could give you a more definitive answer.   If the key changes, but the tonic note does not change, then yes, it is implementing a mode change. Otherwise, it is a full on key change."

musictheory,384oh4,Duckmandu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"The difference between modes and scales is partly of usage. The usage is not entirely consistent, so I can see why it would be confusing.   A ""scale"" usually means a sequence of melodic steps played on a musical instrument or sung, especially for the purpose of practicing. For instance, one does not ""practice one's modes"".  A ""mode"" can have a couple of different meanings. Originally, it means the ""Greek modes"" (probably not really Greek, but there you are), That is: Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. It also implies all the music theory which arises from these modes.   In a more general usage, a ""major mode"" can mean any scale/mode with a major third, and a ""minor mode"" can mean any scale with a minor third.   One inconsistency in these terms comes when you're talking about non-diatonic (other then seven note) scales, such as blues, whole tone, chromatic, or octatonic. In these cases one usually uses the term scale for either playing your instrument or for the notes themselves or for theory, I hardly ever hear the term ""mode"" for these scales.  If you are now thoroughly confused, then I've done my small part to help the advancement of your understanding of music."

musictheory,384oh4,fellchieftan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think of it this way... Picture a gear with different sized teeth (big tooth, small tooth, small tooth, for example).  The gear as a whole represents all the notes in a scale, and no matter which way you turn it, it is the same gear.  Now, imagine cutting the gear and laying it out flat.  Depending on where you make the cut, the gear will have a different pattern (using the above example it could be big, small, small/small, small, big/small, big, small).  Basically using traditional modes each key will use the same notes (the space between each note, either whole or half step, represents the teeth).  Every mode looks the same because they all use the same notes, but the pattern changes depending on your starting point."
musictheory,384oh4,sket0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:13:53 2015 UTC,"First off, all music is intervals. Scales, modes, microtonal music, you name it. If there's movement then there's whole and half steps (and more)  Second, modes pretty much are scales. For a lot of people, when they think of a scale, a picture of the circle of fifths, or a pattern on a guitar neck is what they think of. There's more than just major and minor though.   So let's take a regular c major scale. No sharps or flats in the keysignature. The first more, C Ionian, is just regular c major. For the second mode, you keep the key signature of your base scale, and just shift what note you start of. So the second mode, D Dorian, would be D E F G A B C D. Rearranging the original scale like this changes the order of whole and half steps, consequently chaning the intervals and whether it's major or minor sounding and changes the ""color"" of the scale."
musictheory,384oh4,dejoblue,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Joe Satriani has a great performance example of this that you can hear here: https://youtu.be/5SckVz3XpLs?t=11s  This is more pitch axis theory as he is referencing E as the root each time, but you can hear how each mode sounds different. Modes dont change the key as he was in the example, I presented it just to try to let you hear the mood each mode creates.  Within its encompassing scale it is only really noticeable, to my ears, when combined with harmonizing the scale and playing the modes over their counterpart chords which then goes into chord progressions and modulation. If it is not played over its respective chord, or another chord that it can resolve to, then it always feels like it needs to resolve to the root of the scale it is encompassed within, and that is what is confusing when first learning about modes, that they have to be played against something other than the root or even the chords of the fundamental scale, they have to be played against their harmonized scale or against chords that let them have tension or resolution.  harmonizing the scale is where you get all the chords that you see in instruction books that list the modes and what chords they can be played over.  This is created by starting on each individual note of the scale and creating the triad, or extended chords, with the same formula as the root note/chord of the key.   This is then what allows mod(e)ulation between keys, common chords and scale patterns."

A mode is a shift in tonic within a scale. Basically it's the scale but starting on a different note, but  that's not all that's going on. The shift in tonic changes the intervals between the notes, and so changes the tonality of the scale as a whole. You're playing the scale but experiencing it differently than you normally would.  If you look at the combination of sharps and flats that make up each scale degree compared to a diatonic major you can construct chords unique to each mode too, which will help you further emphasise the effect of the modes."

So much of music theory is about exploration that I think the people who learn and experiment are the ones who succeed.

For you (non-professional and primarily not classical 'art' music), I would suggest first learning all the basic tonal and chromatic harmony, then study the music of prog bands like Yes and jazz artists like Coltrane, Bill Evans, and Thelonious Monk. Not so much for the style or idiom, just the harmony and their approach to it.

Of course, it's satisfying to know what is happening behind the music and every knowledge can help, but it's not a necessary to making metal.  The best advice I can give to you is to put on your favorite tracks (not too fast if possible) and TRY to play along. Don't stop until the end of song. the riffs often repeat throughout the song and you know when, so use this to your advantage, the first verse, try to figure out the notes, next verse: fix mistakes, last verse: rock out.  Repeat daily with as many songs as you want. This will help you develop your ears (Learn to differentiate between rhythm and solo guitar tracks and play both, but don't mix them), you'll learn your favorite songs and most importantly, you'll get comfortable with your instrument. If you do this consistently and with some healthy self-criticism, you'll make much progress while having fun, which is most important anyway.

It is probably not the most obvious choice for a blues on guitar, but assuming they are pros and understand the blues form, they're all going to be just fine.   The one thing that bugs me about the song is that he doesn't warn them about the beginning hits and coming in with the rhythm on the IV chord, but they magically go right along.

musictheory,3817sq,Bigfrostynugs,7,Mon Jun 1 15:27:49 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who's been a professional jazz pianist for 15 years, I respectfully disagree. If the lead gives you a key to play in and your first impulse is to complain, you may not be as professional a musician as you think. It's in year 1 of jazz lessons that you run blues scales in every key. Playing in B natural should be every bit as comfortable as B flat, even if you don't play in it as often.   And speaking as a vocalist, I know my range very, very well. I know that middle C is where it becomes necessary to switch to mixed voice, and that for certain styles of jazz I don't go above D because the tone quality suffers. If I needed to sing a D# as a third for B major, that could be a problem during performance."
musictheory,3817sq,Willravel,-1,Mon Jun 1 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"That's a good reason to not perform that, not to ask everyone else on the band to transpose their parts. That's ridiculous.  And you can say professional jazz musicians should be just as good in B as they are in Bb, but we know that in reality that's not the case. The most commonly used keys are the most familiar, that's just how it is."
musictheory,3817sq,Bigfrostynugs,2,Mon Jun 1 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"Having to skip a whole piece because a member of the professional band can't transpose would be grounds for asking that person to leave the group in my experience, or at the very least to practice and catch up. If you're (the royal you, not you specifically) not ready for that level yet, that's fine, we were all novices at some point, but being a novice means you should be hitting the books, the classes/lessons, and your instrument so you can become good enough to perform at a professional level. There's no such thing as a novice professional.   Yes, people are more familiar with the core keys, but that doesn't mean they have to be at all unfamiliar with less commonly used keys."
musictheory,3817sq,Willravel,0,Mon Jun 1 21:43:54 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the bands ability to transpose, it's about inconveniencing everyone just so that the singer can hit a note that was half step too high for him."
musictheory,3817sq,Bigfrostynugs,2,Tue Jun 2 00:06:32 2015 UTC,"My point is that it's not an inconvenience for professional musicians. If someone asked me to transpose ""My Funny Valentine"" or ""So What"" or ""A Night in Tunesia"" on the fly, I'd just do it, and I'm by no means a particularly skilled professional jazz pianist. It's all just intervals.   Would it inconvenience you if I asked you to play a little louder at bar 12 or watch the tempo at a transition from A section to B? Of course not, because you know what you're doing. You're acting as if transposing is some big deal. It is if you're a student, but it's not if you're a professional."

The audible song has the root of Bb. His fingerings are in B. Thus his guitar is tuned to concert Eb.  Eb concert tuning was pretty standard BECAUSE Blues and early Rock had Saxophones and other typical Jazz ensemble instruments. This is WHY Blues/Jazz artists like Jimi Hendrix/Stevie Ray Vaughan tuned to Eb, to accommodate the ensemble instruments.  The pianist is probably the only one thinking Bb, everyone else is tuned properly and is thinking and playing in B, even tho what comes out is actually Bb."

musictheory,3822ty,JohnWilkesPhonebooth,2,Mon Jun 1 08:08:24 2015 UTC,"Good question, OP. I can only speculate. I guess the floating sound you refer to, which is also present in ""Ode to death"", is also dependant on the use of a choir (for the sake of atmosphere). Holst's music seems to have many layers, which unlike Stravinsky's, aren't dissonant or particularly crazy in terms of rhythm. There is a lot of order in his music, as far as rhythm goes. You don't find the crazy rhythms and polyrhythms Stravinsky used, for instance.  Another reason why we may associate his music to ""cosmic"" things is perhaps explained by a psychological halo effect of sorts. It's known that John Williams was largely influenced by the Planets suite when he was composing the music for Star Wars. Along the name ""The planets"" has made you associate him and by proxy, his music, with cosmic elements. If he had named his compositions ""The 8 elements of alchemy"", your association would be different."

Skipping form as it was its own upper-level course for us as well.   So theory I was basic concepts (chords, intervals, rhythms, modes) and diatonic structures. Theory II was 7th chords, progressions/modulations and voice-leading. Theory III was chromaticism... and a lot of augmented 6th chords, and enharmonic stuff.   Theory IV was not required unless you were a theory/comp major but it was mostly 20th century techniques and trying to find ways to analyze those pieces using the language we'd spent the last three courses learning. We studied Wagner and Debussy's loud and quiet revolutions, twelve-tone and serial music, Messiaen, Crumb, Ligeti, Stockhausen, Cage... and then finished the semester with individual presentations on modern composers we picked.  Each of these courses was also accompanied with an aural skills class and a piano skills class where we learned to hear and play the things we were learning in theory. Jazz theory was a separate short series that I tested out of (barely) so that I could take the counterpoint class that was offered at the same time... but it started with extended chords and voice leading in five-part harmony. And our counterpoint class was 18th century counterpoint that involved a lot writing short pieces, building up to (but never quite getting to) writing fugues. We also used the Kent Kennan book already pointed out.  As for feasibility of catching up over the summer, I certainly wouldn't say it's impossible, but make sure to use the the text the class is using. The concepts will almost certainly be the same, but how we talk about and notate the concepts in analysis changes over time and from author to author, so it would really suck to cram in a year's worth of music theory and then have to relearn chunks of it while tackling new things because you learned the concepts differently on your own from the rest of the class.  You also may want to check with the music department ahead of time about getting in these classes. In my school, because each theory class was actually three different classes taken at the same time (with the aural skills and piano skills components) they discouraged non-majors... it was basically a seven credit course each semester. I know this is one of the things they changed after I left, but I don't know how they structure it at your school. And since they are in a series, it may be required to either take or test out of the earlier theory classes to enroll in the third part."

Our IV is described as Romantic-focused, and there aren't any aural skills or piano skills seminars as far as I know. These (aural and piano) likely comprise some other section of the Music dept, but as a definite outsider to said dept (I've taken the two electroacoustic courses is all), I can't accurately comment."
musictheory,37ytpl,_The_Professor_,6,Sun May 31 19:57:26 2015 UTC,"I'd advise spending just as much time on aural skills as on theory. It's not very useful to learn about things like augmented sixth chords, hemiola, modal mixture, etc. unless you know what they sound like."
musictheory,37ytpl,Bigfrostynugs,6,Sun May 31 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"Possible? I guess. Likely? Probably not.  If you want to catch up you're gonna have to bust your ass, there's a ton to be covered in 2 semesters of theory, and part of it is just spending the time voice leading and analyzing until it becomes second nature and you have a good foundation.  Even if you can cram everything into one summer, you aren't going to have the long term development and regular practice that creates a strong basis for everything else.  But if you work hard it's definitely possible, so get going and spend as much time as possible learning. Also learn the piano keyboard, that's hugely helpful, I would try to learn how to play at least a little, it's hands down the best instrument for conceptualizing theory.  Just as an aside, are you sure your university will even allow this? I know at my college they would never let someone skip straight into theory III, least of all a non-music major."
musictheory,37ytpl,qwfparst,3,Mon Jun 1 02:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a guitarist, and when I started learning theory I decided to take a look at the piano and was absolutely blown away by the difference it makes trying to learn concepts."

I understand piano at a low level (took some lessons as a kid but certainly never finished the conservatory or anything), and my (admittedly absolutely naive) perspective tends to think of guitar as more... pure, in some sense, as relationships are literally geometric on the fretboard.   [and for that matter, my mind puts the computer approach of spectrograms and readouts of mathematical relationships a step further down the road of audio/musical purity.]"
musictheory,37ytpl,Kopachris,2,Mon Jun 1 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Western music theory developed from the prioritization of the diatonic relationship of pitches, within 12-tone divided octave.    The keyboard makes this easier to visualize, and it's arguably the periodic patterns that arose here that has had a stronger influence over theory and composition.   This might hold some interest:  https://archive.org/stream/curiositiesofkey00rhoduoft#page/n3/mode/2up  EDIT:  With your interest in math, I would rather say that rigor of thought is more important than purity.

musictheory,37ytpl,Flewtea,2,Sun May 31 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"We used this plus the workbook, which I think is pretty common. We basically started at the beginning and got through to the end, skipping the chapters on form, because form was covered in an upper-level theory class. This book is also good, I think. If you're just interested in Bach, we also had an upper-level course in 18th century counterpoint using this text.    You can study this stuff on your own, but it's very helpful to have a teacher to correct your work."
musictheory,37ytpl,Flewtea,2,Sun May 31 16:54:40 2015 UTC,I used Laitz a decade ago for the basis of my freshman and sophomore years. Junior and senior years were more about getting into specific styles of composition and more advanced hearings in ear training and sight-singing.
musictheory,37ytpl,quesman1,2,Sun May 31 17:26:06 2015 UTC,"Do you have the workbooks that go with the Laitz? And have you asked for the specific syllabi/talked to the professors in the music dept about what you'd like to do?  It's not just about knowing the ideas but being able to analyze harmony/form and write counterpoint quickly. Otherwise the homework will take you far too long. At my undergrad (if I remember correctly...it's been a while) Theory III assumed a functional grasp of counterpoint, harmonic analysis up through secondary dominants, augmented chords, and modulation, and basic form analysis (such as ternary). The course itself covered the last 3rd or so of Laitz and focused on larger form analysis such as sonatas, and atypical forms and harmonies--usually by analyzing music from the Romantic period. It might be possible to do with a lot of work over the summer since you already know the basics but it would be pretty tough. You'd have a better shot if you found someone to give you theory lessons and check your work."

In the intro, DH (the author) goes so far as to say it comprises, in some sense, a statement of his religious philosophy (as well as just being a book about logic, self-reference, consciousness, and art). And that list, maybe, is an effective summary; it's very much a synthesizing work that pulls together observations from many fields (largely with a mathematical and philosophical bent) to make a very convincing argument regarding systems of thought and consciousness, perhaps even offering some comment on what we are.  If you have a copy handy as it sounds like, skip to the chapter ""Contracrostipunctus."" It's the chapter that, in my opinion, best encapsulates the book's charm in a few minutes' read.

musictheory,3846iv,tjmusic,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:55:42 2015 UTC,Most jazz music uses these elements. Joe Pass is a good example to look at since he sometimes just uses the tritone alone to represent the fully diminished 7th chord in either a way to change the key or to create tension in the song.

musictheory,3846iv,frajen,2,Mon Jun 1 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"In a diminished seventh any note can be the root, so it can be any of four chords.  That makes them very useful as ""pivot"" chords - go into a Dº7 and you can come out of it as if it was an Fº7 or a Bº7.  But keys are still a thing."
musictheory,3846iv,ohsomiggz,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, since the d7 chord can be seen as the 9th being added to a dominant 7th chord it can represent the dominant 7th chords. The root note is usually raised a half step to create this effect and it works since the root not is overpowered by the tritone in the chord. It can also represent their tritone substitutions. As well as the secondary dominant chord to the minor 7th chords in a normal scale system."

The piano is like having a diagram of the theory in front of you all the time, and what he's doing with his hands is realizing the simple theory.  Most beginner coursebooks for piano are going to start way too slow for somebody that's already got some note reading under their belts from band class. He might benefit from something that jumps right in with the assumption of reading, and goes right into scale construction and I and V chords, which is the material of basic beginner songs on the piano.  The obnoxiously titled How to Play the Piano Despite Years of Lessons is the sort of thing I think would work here - it's a piano book, but it's guided by practical theory and harmony.  It focuses exclusively on the practical side of theory, though, and some of the things he'd encounter in a classroom theory course - counterpoint, part writing, etc. - are not covered. But those are easily supplemented, if he's got a firm grasp of the basics of harmony."

musictheory,381iol,DonkeePunchee,3,Mon Jun 1 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"Playing dissonant intervals, like the diminished fifth, in a lower register will cause the chord to sound more muddled/distorted. Too many lower notes will also cause this. That's why you'll generally be playing power chords on the low end of the guitar, not triads. It'd be too much for the low end."
musictheory,381iol,mazegeek999,2,Mon Jun 1 04:58:26 2015 UTC,"Try these voicings:  B°  e-   e- B-   B-3 G-7  G-4 D-9  D-3 A-8  A-2 E-7  E-     Bø7  e-   e-   B-6  B-3 G-7  G-2 D-7  D-3 A-x  A-2 E-7  E-     B°7  e-   e- B-6  B-3 G-7  G-1 D-6  D-3 A-x  A-2 E-7  E-   Being that these chords contain diminished fifths, they tend to be kind of muddy when played too low.

musictheory,37zab3,TheChurchofHelix,5,Sun May 31 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"I play bass in a couple bands, and I'm gonna be playing in some festivals this summer. I write a majority of the songs we play, and I could probably help you out.  Let's start from the base of the issue. If you feel like your sound is narrowed by what you listen to, then expand your listening. People who only listen to green day most likely are going to make green day sounding bass lines. Once you sort of diversify, then you'll begin to think differently. For example, when I'm playing in a classic rock song and I'm improvising (which is what I do most of the song anyway), I'll rely heavily on pentatonics because that's the groundwork of what classic rock is build upon, and I've listened to and played along with enough classic rock to understand that. Now when I move to math rock, I'll work a bit differently, because I listen to that a lot as well. So try that, try expanding your listening to more complex or just different in general artists than green day, and just as importantly, pick up your bass while you're listening and trying playing along doing whatever you think sounds good with it.  Something else I do is just play more than just bass. I'll move from practicing bass, which I'm very trained and practiced in, to something like piano. Right now, for instance, I'm covering Aphex Twin songs by ear on keys, even though I'm not fantastic at them. Whenever I jam, I won't always bring my bass and sometimes take a role as rhythm guitar, which is what I advise more than anything to learn to play. Rhythm guitar functions as the entire harmony of many songs, and getting a grasp on that will be huge to your playing on bass. At the point I'm at now, I can completely improvise an entire song structure on guitar with jazz chords and it definitely brings a different element to my playing on bass.  One final thing I could add would have to be improvisation. Over at /r/makinghiphop when people ask ""how do I be a better rapper"" the best answer is always ""practice freestyling as much as you can."" The same applies with writing music. Practice improvising, adding embellishments to barebones riffs, etc. And keep writing songs. I bet Paul McCartney had some really really shitty songs when he first started writing. As time went on, he got better. So will you.  Good luck."
musictheory,37zab3,808scripture,3,Mon Jun 1 00:57:23 2015 UTC,"You gotta find your own style! You're almost there! You gotta go into random genres like jazz, and hip-hop, and death metal to learn new styles and ways of singing. Try to copy or imitate a bit more before making your own style. You probably need like 20 or 30 influences to make your own style.  On the subject of Paul McCartney: Have you seen how many songs that guy wrote? Keep writing! Throw songs away. He has written a few mediocre and 1 or 2 horrible songs too.  Finally, you need to differentiate between the ""song' and the ""bassline."" Paul McCartney wrote a song and then PLAYED bass TO the song. He didn't write a bass-song. Go to piano and guitar to compose. Then chords and melody will make more sense."

Secondly, all great artists steal and borrow from their influences. There's no shame in that. If you listen to mainstream popular music, you're going to write stuff that is derivative of that. I suggest listening to a lot of Classical music, Jazz, underground Art Rock, contemporary Indie Rock bands, music from other cultures etc... If you are stealing from bands nobody else knows, nobody is going to know that you're stealing."
musictheory,37zvfq,HedY92,5,Sun May 31 20:24:43 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy! I took a quick glance and there's some good stuff here- it looks like you have a grasp on the harmonies in the piece and it looks like you gave some thought to voice leading, which is important!  That said, there are some improvements you can make: Firstly, I'm not sure what your intention for the second chord is. The first chord is Eb-7 in a drop-2 position. The next chord doesn't look like anything to me: F C G E D. Instead of this (which, if I'm reading it correctly, simply doesn't work) I'd suggest a fully diminished chord, which is a common choice for passing chord. The notes for the second chord would then be, from the top down: F D B Ab F or F B Ab F D. Try those and see how they sound to you.  The other big issue I see is that your voices become much too spread out in the latter portion of this excerpt. In this context, it is far better to stick to block or drop-2 voicings, especially as a beginner.  If you haven't formally learned about drop-2 yet, it is a block voicing in which the second highest voice gets dropped an octave. Take for example the Ab9 in the second bar, with the Bb in the melody.  Block voicing: Bb Gb Eb C Bb  Drop 2: Bb Eb C Bb Gb  In this particular case, the block voicing is more likely superior. Drop 2 works best when the top voice is in a higher register (near the top of the treble staff and above) or when the second voice is close to the top voice (a half or whole step away) and you don't want the melody to be muddled.  Overall, it's really not a bad start. Understanding the harmony is the most important thing. I hope you continue to work at this and I'm happy to help you out if you have more questions! Just let me know.  EDIT: I just saw your recent post asking for advice on how to approach 5-voice harmony. For a beginner like yourself, THIS comment is way more on point than some others in that thread. Another comment in that thread was talking about quartal voicings and other more advanced stuff that is really unnecessary knowledge for you right now, and may be why you made some of the choices you did on this project.   Trust the advice /u/PullTheOtherOne gave you here"

About the block chords, I wanted to go for them from the beginning but since the melody is Eb and the first note below it will be a Db (a whole step) I started with a drop 2. So every time I try to go back to block chords I find it that's gonna be actually a big jump so that leave me to these 2 questions: 1/Is it okay to go back to block chords after a spaced voicing  ? 2/What are the best situations to use diminished passing chords ?"
musictheory,37zvfq,indianatrumpet,2,Sun May 31 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"Of course man! You can use block and spaced chords (such as the drop 2) interchangeably- whatever works best for voice leading.  Diminished passing chords are best on upbeats when the melody contains a non chord tone. Another technique for non chord tones is whole/half step planing. For example, if you harmonize the first Eb as Eb-7 in drop 2, you can utilize ""whole step planing"" for the F on the upbeat and for an F-7 in drop 2, if that makes sense. Just a couple of many techniques for dealing with non chord tones. Good luck!"

Finish off with a whole note E.  Edit: I don't think this is right, but in the off chance, is it this? Your measures do remind me of the intro to Earth, Wind, and Fire's Let's Groove."

Get your spacial awareness going again at the keyboard so you don't have to look down or anything to see where notes are and whatnot.

musictheory,37vh8i,Constasius,2,Sun May 31 12:06:12 2015 UTC,"I would start by learning all of your scales and plunking out chords with each scale (start with major, then minor). Once you feel comfortable with each chord, try putting them in inversions so you can feel the movement in your hands. Then move onto a simple progression like going I - V - I. If you learn them like this first, sight reading gets a lot easier. And don't try to learn everything at once! Maybe just start with C major and see how it goes, then try G major, etc. Also, find songs that have simple chord movement in the left hand and a melody in the right because that will help you get stronger movement with chords and recognizing them within pieces.   I am an instrumentalist learning piano and sight reading is difficult for me because of the multiple lines. Sometimes finding music that arpeggiates in the left hand really helps (like C - E - G - E - C, for example) because you get used to the chords and notes also and it makes them easier to recognize and feel when you play more complex music.   Another big thing to remember is you haven't played in years so don't beat yourself up if you ""suck"" just because you were once better. Start small and keep going. Good luck!"

The notes contained in the current chord are notes we want to ""land on"", in other words they are consonance. Other notes that are foreign to the notes contained in the chord are dissonance. What we want to do with these is to land on consonances while using passing dissonances. The consonances are places we want to stay, and dissonances are places we don't want to go, but sometimes we have to walk through them."

Look up George Russell's lydian chromatic concept. It's very common to do this in Jazz.  2) A common substitution in 12 bar blues is to play the lydian dominant scale over the IV chord rather than the mixolydian scale.

musictheory,37w393,Squirrel54,6,Sat May 30 21:55:36 2015 UTC,"Most conflict? That's not exactly what a dominant is. A dominant note (and its chord) is the fifth step of the scale, and whether the scale is major or minor it's almost always in the major form (though in a minor scale it could be in the minor form - it depends if you're using natural minor or harmonic minor). In your example of B minor, it would be either F# or F#m (or sometimes F#7/F#m7) because that's the fifth scale degree of B minor.   The reason the dominant is used frequently as a transition to the tonic is each of the notes resolves extremely well in step-wise motion to the tonic chord. In B minor, F# stays the same, A# goes to B, and C# goes to D. These are all either 0 (same) or 1 step transitions, which makes for smooth voice leading.   The supertonic is the second degree of the scale, mediant is third, subdominant is fourth, submediant is sixth, and subtonic/leading tone is seventh.   Classically the dominant - tonic was used to end a ton of progressions, and most music has a dominant - tonic resolution somewhere in it. You can use any chord progression you want, and I know people who don't like the sound of dominant - tonic as much as other resolutions. It is one of the most widely used resolutions however, and important to know about."
musictheory,37w393,Morgoth714,4,Sat May 30 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Typically you'll have tonic chords, predominant (or subdominant) chords, and dominant chords. The tonic chord, as you said, is your home chord. It's basically just the root chord of the key. So in B minor, the tonic chord is simply B minor.   Dominant chords are chords that want to go to the tonic. Dominant chords are unstable and want to be resolved. Typically, our ear hears the V chord and the vii chord to be the most unstable. Why is this? Well first, to make sure you know what I mean by V chord and vii chord, let me explain.  The V chord starts on the 5th note of the scale/key and is a triad. It's like the tonic chord, except that's a I chord. Because it starts on the first note. The first note is B, so it's B minor.  So what's the dominant chord? Well, like you said, F# minor. By why? Well, remember B minor is B, C#, D, E, F#, G, A, B. Start on the fifth note, F#, and build thirds. So the V chord is F#, A, C#. Here's the thing though. The big reason for the need for this chord to pull back to B minor is actually because of the 7th note of the scale. The 7th note of the scale wants to pull up to the first note. As a result, in B minor, A wants to pull up to B. The A note is part of F# minor, so it makes the chord have tension.  However, most of the time, the V chord in a minor key, like B minor, will actually be made major, so that the A becomes A# and you have F#, A#, C#. Why? Because A# has an even stronger pull to B than A does to B. The half step beats the whole step here. So usually, the V chord is made major in both major and minor keys for the purpose of resolution.  The same idea goes with the vii diminished chord. So you start on the 7th note of the scale and build thirds. So we have A, C#, E. Now this isn't a diminished chord; it's a major chord. Like I said earlier, for purposes of resolution, that A is usually brought up to A#. So we got A#, C#, E. And that resolves nicely to B, D, F#, which is B minor!  Lastly as for predominant, these are chords that want to go the dominant, but it's not as strong of a pull as dominant is to tonic. The ii- dim and iv chords in minor (or ii and IV in major) are the main predominant chords. So in B minor, the ii-diminished chord is C#, E, G (C# diminished), and the iv chord is E, G, B (E minor). Both of these chords lead nicely to F# major, the V chord, and A# diminished, the vii-dim chord.  That's the basics! If you have other questions feel free to ask."

musictheory,37u2jo,Meooooooooooooow,1 point,Sat May 30 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"You're right.

Perhaps you don't know F# major by heart. If you don't, then memorize the major scale pattern (this is all you need to memorize): R W W H W W W H. After that, build intervals off of the root: F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, E#, F#.  Then you can form a major chord off of this. Take the F# major chord. You know that the chord will have the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the F# major scale. So the F# major chord is F#, A#, C#.  The idea here is not to memorize the chords in every key. It's to memorize the pattern in general form, then apply those patterns to specific keys. Eventually through this, you'll get accustomed to each key and you'll know the chords and scales more naturally."

musictheory,37sono,WakeVajZet,3,Sun May 31 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"When you write out a normal 7-tone scale (like major or minor), it's customary to use one letter for each note. A-G is seven letters. If I wrote F instead of E for the F# major scale, it would look like F#, G#, A#, B, C#, D#, F, F#. Notice how there are two letter-Fs (three if you count the octave F#), and no E.  It's just a nitpicky thing, but definitely relevant when looking at key signatures, since F# major has 6 sharps, and it looks better to write E# than put a natural next to an F note."

Then it's worth knowing the differences between each from the context of intervals.  So Dorian? yeah it's the 2nd mode, great... so it's a minor scale with a min3rd (b3) of course, yeah it's got a dom7th (b7) like most of them too (we're not harmonising Harmonic minor here with it's Maj7th (7))... hey it's got a Maj6th (6)... That sets it apart from Phrygian, Aeolian, and Locrian with their min6th (b6).   What defines Mixolydian outside it being the 5th mode? It's Major with a Maj3rd (3), what else?"
musictheory,37sono,Mr-Yellow,3,Sat May 30 04:32:27 2015 UTC,"No one has actually taken you through learning these scales, with a step by step method, so here goes:  1) Let's begin by learning the seven flat scales as they relate to C Major - the easiest scale to remember as it's all white keys on the piano from C to C.   F Major - begins on the fourth note of C Major, and uses all the notes of C Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Bb Bb Major - begins on the fourth note of F Major, and uses all the notes of F Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Eb. Now we have Bb and Eb. Eb Major - begins on the fourth note of Bb Major, and uses all the notes of Bb Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Ab. Now we have Bb, Eb, and Ab. Ab Major - begins on the fourth note of Eb Major, and uses all the notes of Eb Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Db. Now we have Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db. Db Major - begins on the fourth note of Ab Major, and uses all the notes of Ab Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Gb. Now we have Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, and Gb. Gb Major - begins on the fourth note of Db Major, and uses all the notes of Db Major EXCEPT we lower the FOURTH NOTE to Cb. Now we have Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, and Cb. Cb Major begins on the fourth note of Gb Major and is basically the end of our flat scales (of the major scale series) because we will have now lowered all seven of our white keys on the piano. This gives us Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Cb, and Fb.    2) Now, let's learn the seven sharp scales beginning from C Major, and take notice that as we get toward the end, many of these enharmonically overlap with the flat scales we just learned in step one.   Go to the fifth note of C Major, building a scale beginning on G, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to F#. Go to the fifth note of G Major, building a scale beginning on D, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to C#. We now have F# and C#. Go to the fifth note of D Major, building a scale beginning on A, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to G#. We now have F#, C#, and G#. Go to the fifth note of A Major, building a scale beginning on E, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to D#. We now have F#, C#, G#, and D#. Go to the fifth note of E Major, building a scale beginning on B, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to A#. We now have F#, C#, G#, D#, and A#. Go to the fifth note of B Major, building a scale beginning on F#, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to E#. We now have F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, and E#. Go to the fifth note of F# Major, building a scale beginning our final sharp scale on C#, and raise the SEVENTH NOTE to B#. We now have F#, C#, G#, D#, A#, E#, and B#.   NOTE: A helpful way to remember this order for sharps is ""Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle"" and a helpful way to remember this order for flats is to reverse it, ""Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father.""  Once you have learned all twelve major scales, finding your minor scales, modes, and eventually all the chords associated with these structures becomes a whole lot more straight-forward."

musictheory,37sono,Pabl0Esc0bar,2,Sat May 30 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"My method for chords is taking a basic pop song and learning the chords on piano. Usually they will be pretty repetitive. Once you think you have them down, try singing along (it doesn't matter if you think you can't sing well!). This will add pressure for you to be able to instantly recall the chords. Once you can get through the song without hesitating, learn another one (often it will have at least one chord in common with the last song). Do this until you are comfortable with recalling the shape of all of the major and minor chords.   This has been effective for both me and some of my friends. Good luck!"
musictheory,37sono,noturtles,2,Sat May 30 05:50:49 2015 UTC,"I learned scales and chords through muscle memory and lots of practice. With scales, I had to begrudgingly put myself through them when I was younger. As I practiced, I would connect the patterns visually and the scales just ""clicked"".  For chords, I had to put myself in a situation where I had to perform chords on cue (playing for a church choir) and not by using sheet music either, just by their letters: Bmin, Ab min, Cdim, Gmaj, etc. I had to do this every week, so I'd practice and practice each chord until it was all muscle memory. Putting yourself through immense pressure helps I guess lol  I think it all comes down to to putting yourself through scales and chords and visually understanding the placements of your fingers while doing so. I suppose your brain ends up making the connections in the long run.  You can also try learning a song in a specific scale and practicing it like hell. Then begin to write your own music with that scale in mind. It's a lot more fun that way.   And this may be a long shot but if you have access to a mallet instrument like marimba or xylophone, I strongly suggest learning scales with the circle of fiths. in this scenario, you can clearly see what key follows the next. I think this process helped me the most by far! :)  Tl;dr: practice your scales and chords but don't just be passive about it. Scales: visually follow the ""pattern"" of a scale until it sticks. Chords: same deal, visually follow how it builds. Learn songs then start composing your own material/variation of said song. Best way to learn scales tho imho? Play the circle of fiths with a mallet instrument. Once you understand scales, chords will follow."

Start with a small pile and then keep adding more.  Start with Major keys and then throw in minor bit by bit.  In addition to recognizing key sigs, you should also be able to name the notes in order in the key (eg A Major is A B C# D E F# G# A; G min is G A Bb C D Eb F G.) Spend time with your instrument to prove to your ears what you've learned.  If well memorized, this foundation will make learning all subsequent concepts MUCH easier.  (eg modes, altered scales, arpeggios, etc.) I effectively taught myself and my ex-gf who was an untrained vocalist music theory this way.

And I practice that for along time to the point to where I don't even think about what I am playing I just play."
musictheory,37sono,TheMaster0rion,1 point,Sat May 30 07:32:36 2015 UTC,"Intervals were confusing to me when I was a beginner, so although I knew the pattern WWHWWWH, I couldn't figure the scales out in my head and would need a piano in front of me, (so on tests I would go as far as drawing a little piano and count up) not exactly an effective method.    If it does work for you though, then you know to get the harmonic minor scale you just start the scale on the 6th degree of the major and raise the leading tone.   Afterwards I tried memorizing the circle of 5ths, which also proved to be troubling for me. I could memorize it fine but I would always get confused with the accidentals and how f# minor was the first scale on the right side with an accidental and Bb major was the first with one on the left - it didn't make sense to me. Probably because I didn't understand intervals.   For me the most effective method was actually memorizing all of the scales. Learning each one on the piano and playing them all through in 4 octaves every day until I got them all down. I used Hanon to get the correct fingerings and used that method of progression. Starting with C major, playing the relative harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales, then going down the left side of the circle of 5ths (4ths) until I ended up back at C. This also becomes a good warm-up routine. Once you start learning the arpeggios throw those in there too.   But don't be shy of learning intervals. This was just the way I went about it."
musictheory,37sono,AugustFay,1 point,Sat May 30 12:48:08 2015 UTC,"I think there are really two parts to this - theory and application.  The theory part means knowing how each chord and scale is spelled.  I think learning the scale spellings is best done by rote - they are to the musician what multiplication is to the mathematician.  Just drill them over and over until you know them by heart.  Application is another thing entirely, and it depends on your instrument.  If you play a fretted instrument (guitar, bass, mandolin, banjo) you can memorize a fingering - then you can find the root and you've got then scale.    If you play a keyboard instrument, scale fingerings come more or less in pairs - if you learn C major, G major is identical through the first hand position, and the crossover point is the same for both hands.  The same will be true of D major and A major, so learn them in pairs.  (Mallet percussion won't have ""fingerings"", but you'll still find it useful to learn them in pairs.)  If you play a woodwind or brass instrument it's a little bit trickier, because there are alternate fingerings/valve combinations that may work better for some scales.  On these instruments make sure you have the scale spelling down cold before you tackle a new scale."

(There is a difference. 2-1 suspensions are normally forbidden, because they sound bad, and anyway the suspension here is literally 9-8.) But they have mis-identified the other suspension, A to G, as a 4-3 suspension; it isn't, it's a 7-6 suspension (A is a seventh above Bb, G is a sixth above Bb).  So the whole thing could be described as a G minor chord in first inversion with 9-8 and 7-6 suspensions in it.

For example, in the Dante Sonata the structure (and in that way the development) follows Dante's Divine Comedy. In Rachmaninoff's Isle of the Death the 5/4 measure is used to suggest the feeling of rowing.

Absolutely the former. In transcription, especially of something soloistic like a pop vocal melody, there's always a question of where do you draw the line? If you were to actually look mathematically at precisely where everything falls, there's going to be all kinds of microscopic speed-ups, slow-downs, displacements, anticipations, etc. At the same time, if your Adele transcription looks like this, it's not going to be of much use to anyone!  So there's often a level of subjectivity in how you transcribe the rhythms, or even notes. Sometimes a less ""accurate"" transcription can capture the intent of the music much better, because most of what Adele's doing is improvised anyway. It's not like she was looking at a piece of sheet music full of precise syncopated 16th note rhythms. More likely she had a simpler framework (either in her head or written down) that she was elaborating one.  This leads you to the question of what your transcription is for. Are you trying to create something you can perform from, and play your own cover of the piece? Then you don't need all the detail that's in that published version, since you probably want to make the cover your own in some ways.

If a teacher isn't available to you, that is quite unfortunate. It seems like it is very easy to view Schenkerian analysis in very strict, unsubtle, or not very flexible terms. Or at least, that was the way I thought it appeared when I encountered it in my undergraduate years. It took a teacher to make me realize what a remarkably flexible and fluid analytical tool it was. But perhaps that is just my own experience."

musictheory,37r4zc,nmitchell076,6,Fri May 29 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"It's good that you will eventually have a teacher. My honest advice is to wait and do your Schenker work in grad school (is this for theory? Or for performance or something else with there being a required analysis class?).   I think there are other areas of theory that work better for self-study. Caplin and Hepokoski/Darcy can be self-studied for form; Gjerdingen is an easy read for Schema Theory; Lerdahl/Jackendoff, Rothstein (even with his Schenker sketches), Krebs, and Mirka good reads for studies of rhythm and meter, etc.   I don't know why, but the thought of self-studying Schenker just sends off red flags for me. But others might have a different, positive experience with self-study and Schenker."
musictheory,37r4zc,nlaeae,2,Fri May 29 20:06:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but the thought of self-studying Schenker just sends off red flags for me.    I find it weird how Peter Westergaard's Introduction to Tonal Theory doesn't get more attention for this. Of course getting hold of a copy can be a pain since it's out of print, but it is an introductory textbook written from a largely Schenkerian perspective (in fact, Westergaard's theory is even more 'radical' than most Schenkerians', so it successfully dispenses with many complications that are found in these other approaches) and, being an actual textbook, it has lots of Schenkerian exercises.  Approaching it practically does require a high level of ear-training/audiation and preferably some familiarity with species counterpoint, but this might not be a huge issue if you're about to start a masters' in composition."

I can recommend Drs. Rogers and Ottoman's book for some context and for the great exercises.  It's all about consistency, and making sure you are singing what logically would come next. Knowing where tendency tones in the melodic line are going to go, what certain interval leaps are common with certain harmonizations and melody choices. The best way to do it is to take a short excerpt of ANYTHING (simple to difficult, at first), record yourself sight-singing it after giving yourself 30~ seconds to study it, and tonicizing the key and starting pitch. then, play it back so you can do error identification, try again, and then listen and play through.  Just remember, it's aural -skills-. You aren't just going to wake up overnight and have suddenly gained the ability to sight-sing any melody or inner voice at once.

Also, interval training. Memorize your intervals!

Each section provides non-tonal and non-rhythmic exercises using the interval in question and then adds context in the form of rhythm and tonality including a wide variety of excerpts from the literature of Western music, everything from chant to Bartók and atonality. As you progress the intervals aggregate, i.e. you use seconds with thirds, then seconds with thirds and fourths, etc. It's a slick method but quite demanding.

musictheory,37r5y9,nmitchell076,2,Fri May 29 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"Okay. I mean, yeah, there's nothing wrong with doing that. But I also think two PACs in the home key becomes a little boring. Why should we continue on from one PAC into the next section? What compels us forward? Often times the ones that cadence twice in the home key are extremely short and light minuets, because no modulation in the first half suggests that we aren't expending a whole lot of effort. But your minuet has a lot of effort built into it, lots of nice swells and ebbs and flows and whatnot. But to what end? At the end of the day we've expended a lot of energy to go nowhere tonally. That's why I think a modulation would be nice, it gives the energy of your phrases a point, a direction.   I tend to find a two sentence structure that moves first to a half cadence and then to a PAC (known as a period) is a good structure because there's something left open and then something after it to close it down (that is, we need the next phrase because the first phrase isn't completely closed). And similarly, if our first half can be left open by modulating to the dominant, then we need a second half to bring us back and cadence in the tonic. The phrases thus have meaning that extends beyond themselves: they have implications for what will happen next.   Consider this, what prevents you from taking the two phrases that you have now, slapping a repeat after the first cadence and then calling the result your minuet?"

So, for example, a jazz musician might only want to know ""Is it D minor or D major?,"" a student of Schenkerian analysis might view a D-major chord in a C-major passage as the II stufe, and a more traditional harmonist might want to call it a V/V, even if it never resolves to V."

If I write a progression that goes I - II - I, then functionally it isn't a secondary dominant at all because it doesn't really tonicize the dominant key at all. But usually I'd still call it V/V anyway."
musictheory,37oo30,romericus,0,Fri May 29 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"Just because it doesn't resolve to V doesn't mean it isn't tonicizing V. Tonicization happens because you're making something ""appear"" to be tonic. By playing a major two in the context of a major key, you're making the V sound like it would be tonic, whether or not you actually play the V. Play around in the key of C, and then play a D major chord. Naturally, what chord do you want to resolve it to? A G chord. That's tonicizing the G chord. Even if you then play, for instance, an Em (iii in the C), it's still going to sound like a deceptive cadence in G (D -> Em). You're still tonicizing G, because the iii is actually going to ""sound"" like a vi in G.   edit: so it's still going to be acting as a V/V whether or not you actually resolve to V."
musictheory,37oo30,nmitchell076,2,Fri May 29 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree, there are musically satisfying ways to resolve a major supertonic besides going to V, which also sound natural. Just because you're playing a II doesn't mean V is always implied. Harmony isn't that black & white, it's flexible."
musictheory,37oo30,romericus,7,Fri May 29 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"Some academic papers use all uppercase roman numerals. I guess the idea is that anyone reading the article should know enough about music theory that differentiation is unnecessary. The reader is assumed to already know that the supertonic is minor in a major key, and diminished in minor. When you think about it, if the music is following ""the rules"" all you need is the scale degree and mode to know what the chord is. It also makes the visual aids/examples look cleaner when everything is upper case.   Now if you're talking about someone labeling something II and it is a major chord functioning like a V/V, then of course the label is wrong. But it could also be functioning like a IV/vi, or a I/ii, so context is necessary."
musictheory,37oo30,nonotan,1 point,Fri May 29 06:53:28 2015 UTC,"A four of six, or one of two? You're going to have to explain that one to me. Unless we're talking about a modulation to the relative minor, or the key of the supertonic, (in which case you'd just label a modulation and call it a IV or I) I've never heard of a secondary predominant, or secondary tonic. As far as I know, those aren't a thing. Can you elaborate?"
musictheory,37oo30,nmitchell076,2,Fri May 29 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"So modulation and tonicization are often cleanly separated in pedagogy, because such a clean category distinction is easy for people to quickly categorize in their head (and because it's easier to test). But in reality, the distinction between modulation and tonicization is a matter of interpretation and the lines between the two are more blurry than they might first appear.   For instance, people often consider modulations to be what happens when we cadence in a new key, when we ""forget"" about the tonal gravity of the home key tonic and allow ourselves to feel pulled toward another key. But some people would like to say that the original tonic doesn't actually ever go away, that any motion away from tonic is fundamentally unstable and the tonic must be returned to for the piece to feel closed. So the tonal gravity of the tonic never really goes away, and all modulations would become these tonicization that just last for a really long time. These people would say that modulation is a feature of the musical surface, but at a deeper level of structure, they all function as tonicizations."
musictheory,37oo30,nmitchell076,2,Fri May 29 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of people think of V/V as a thing. It's an applied chord that ""points"" to V.   But another way to think of it is a chord that is borrowed from another key. In the key of C, a D major chord is borrowed from the key of G in order to make G sound more like a temporary tonic.  So V/V is really a dominant chord being borrowed from the key of the dominant.  Each chord has a specific function within a key. The reason II is a bad label for a D major chord, is because it's not functioning like a supertonic chord in C; it's functioning like a dominant chord in G, hence the V/V.   Theoretically, you can have any X/X. If you think of the slash as short hand for ""in the key of"" you could say a C major chord in C major is I/I, and F major would be IV/I, and A minor would be vi/I. As redundant as that would be, it would be correct.  So any minor chord could be (depending on context) interpreted as any minor chord in any diatonic key: ii/X, iii/X, vi/X, or i/x, iv/x, v/x. Any major chord could be I/X, IV/X, V/X or III/x, V/x, VI/x (X = major key, x = minor key)  For example, if you were in C major, and came across an f minor chord. Taking modal mixture out of the equation, you cannot interpret that as IV, since IV has to be major in a major key. So your interpretive choices are ii/Eb, iii/Db, vi/Ab, i/f, iv/c, or v/b-flat. (how you interpret it depends on how it functions, especially in relation to the next chord)  Same thing if you came across an Ab major chord in C major (VI). Your choices are I/Ab, IV/Eb, V/Db, III/f, V/Db, VI/C.   Usually these secondary interpretations are not singular events. ii/V is usually followed by V/V, which goes to V.  vi/vi usually goes to iio/vi which goes to V/vi which goes to i/vi. At that point it might be easier to just call it a modulation.     So where does I/ii and IV/vi come in to play? It doesn't. I made a mistake in my previous post. IV/vi would have to be iv/vi because the subdominant is minor in a minor key. For the same reason, I/ii would have to be i/ii. (that is, unless you open up the door to modal mixture, which isn't helpful to this discussion)."
musictheory,37oo30,cruzan,2,Sat May 30 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, V/V doesn't have to resolve to a V. It most often does, but V/V often goes to a cadential 64, and there are cases to be made for not resolving to a dominant at all."
musictheory,37oo30,cruzan,1 point,Fri May 29 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"Any other? So what if it's acting as e.g. a IV/vi? Or anything else other than V/V but still easily described with slash roman numeral notation? To be sure, V/V is going to be the most common by at least an order of magnitude, but still.  I'd argue II is the most ""proper"" spelling mostly in contexts where it is part of the scale (i.e. it's basically a Lydian II, whether in a pure Lydian context or through modal interchange). At the same time, I don't feel like using II in other contexts should be considered a ""mistake"". Sometimes the implied functionality isn't 100% obvious, there is ambiguity of some sort, or just generally you want to notate what the ""facts"" are (the harmony here corresponds to the II major chord in the current key) without interpreting it in any way."
musictheory,37oo30,cruzan,2,Fri May 29 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"What if we have something like I V vi ii vi? In my mind, such a progression moves to vi and then embellishes vi with plagal motion. It would make sense in such a situation to think of ii as a iv/vi, yes?"

musictheory,37oo30,m3g0wnz,0,Fri May 29 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. V/x and viio7 /x are the only ""slash chords"" (secondary chords) I've ever seen, and I'm pretty sure they're the only ones music theory actually uses. Most anything else is actually going to be a modulation.   And actually, technically using a secondary dominant-dominant chord progression isn't really a modulation. It's a tonicization, which is close to a modulation, but it goes immediately back to the original tonic, so it can't be considered a modulation without further context in the key of the dominant. So like, if you were in the key of C and you played C, D7, G, C you'd just briefly tonicized G, and jumped back to C. But if you played, C, D7, G, Am7, D7, G you would call it a modulation, because there's continued context in the new key."
musictheory,37oo30,nmitchell076,2,Fri May 29 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm wrong about this, but  could it not be a borrowed chord from some other key? or some other function? Is it really always going to function as V/V?"

So if a major scale has notes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, then you can make the nashville number chords like so:    Nashville Number Chord notes Chord type    1 1 3 5 maj   2 2 4 6 min   3 3 5 7 min   4 4 6 1 maj   5 5 7 2 maj   6 6 1 3 min   7 7 2 4 dim    Notice the 1 4 and 5 are all major chords.  If you were in a minor key, then 1 4 and 5 are all minor chords.  Because a minor scale is just a major scale but you start on the 6th degree, you could reuse this chart, if you consider 6 to be 1.  So instead of 1, (1+3), (1+4) you have 6, (6+3), (6+4) => 6 2 3 (because mod 7 arithmetic), and those are all minor.  Hope that's helpful."

musictheory,37mi9z,vornska,2,Thu May 28 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"I should start with a disclaimer that I'm primarily interested in classical music and know relatively little about jazz.  The Laitz is a very good book (minus some typos), but it's very focused on classical music. Its main focus is teaching you the harmonic language of classical music: the grammar of how chords can connect to other chords. This is really good stuff to know, but it's also important to realize that you're learning the grammar of a specific language... To a large extent, jazz harmony developed out of that grammar, but jazz is also its own language.   Your plan sounds like a great one to me, but then I also think it's a good idea to learn Latin as the basis for learning Spanish/Italian/French. Lots of people understandably don't have the patience for that. So it depends on how broad your musical interests are & how quickly you want to dive into something practical.  I guess that sounds like I'm discouraging you from using the Laitz, which isn't my intent at all. It's a solid textbook & will teach you a lot that's relevant to all western music. It'll also teach you what most people spend 3-4 semesters learning in college, so depending on what your educational plans are, it can give you a huge leg up. It's just that the Laitz will also teach you some things that are only applicable to classical music while ignoring some important things because they aren't applicable to it."

While music theory will help me and definitely has practical use, it is also something that I would learn for my own enjoyment, for myself, and for that reason, it doesn't seem wrong to spend more time on it if I'll get a broader understanding of Western music as a whole.

musictheory,37m7t6,MSCViolin,1 point,Thu May 28 18:19:30 2015 UTC,"Good question! This is a cool technique which could be considered two chords at the same time, but I think I'd consider it differently.  First of all, it sounds like the beginning guitar is playing power chords, meaning the third isn't heard. So the ""E"" chord he's playing sounds to be really just E and B, not E, G#, and B. Not super important, but since you're asking about why the chords don't sound all jumbled up, it's good to know.  Now the guitarist is playing C#m over that E power chord. This could be looked at in a few different ways. Here's one way. Let's look at the notes of each other and see how the two chords together aren't as jumbled up as you might expect.  E power chord: E, B  C#m: C#, E, G#  Notice that if you put all the notes together, you get C#, E, G#, B. Hey, that's a C#m7 (also can be called an E6)! And then the 2nd guitar changes from C#m to E major (simply by changing one note: C# to B). To make sure you understand that, here's the notes for C#m and E major:  C#m: E G# C#  E major: E G# B  The C# to B pitch change is the highest pitch you hear in that part of the song. It also might sound like a resolution, in the sense that the C# feels like it needs to be ""pulled"" to the B note. In which case you're hearing a non-chord tone that has a delayed resolution, which is a different way of looking at it than the C#m7 view.  As for the C#add9 to F#, I think that chord is actually a B add 9, as in, B, D#, F#, C#. In which case, that makes sense, because it's over a B power chord. And then the F# works because it's over an F# power chord."

musictheory,37is2h,REJECTED_FROM_MENSA,2,Thu May 28 18:34:06 2015 UTC,"I think the reason he was getting at was its dissonance and lack of resolution, but if that's what you want then Locrian would be perfect!"
musictheory,37is2h,sidedishes,3,Thu May 28 18:45:01 2015 UTC,Thrash metal employs a phrygian/aeolian/locrian scale system. I'll dig around for examples later. I recall finding some instances in Anthrax's music.
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,6,Thu May 28 00:59:43 2015 UTC,Is it actually a Locrian modality or just music that occasionally uses flat 5ths and 2nds? For something to be truly Locrian it seems like it should have to tonicize a diminished chord.
musictheory,37is2h,Bigfrostynugs,4,Thu May 28 02:13:37 2015 UTC,It's usually phrygian with an occasional ♭5. I'm on my phone right now and can't do much of a survey of my library. I'll have a look around and share what I come up with later though.
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,1 point,Thu May 28 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"In any event, sounds cool!"
musictheory,37is2h,Bigfrostynugs,4,Thu May 28 03:03:51 2015 UTC,"Slayer - Chemical Warfare has the bare minimum to count for locrian. The riff at 0:23 consists of the pitches D# E F# A (1 ♭2 ♭3 ♭5).  There are a lot of ♭5's in the style, but mostly as a borrowed note or alteration. For instance, in Anthrax - Blood, the riff at 1:14 uses E aeolian with a ♭5. Interestingly, in Anthrax - Imitation of Life, 0:30 is F# locrian, but with a major third."
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,1 point,Thu May 28 11:48:01 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool, thanks for sharing! At the same time, I wouldn't say any of that is essentially Locrian, it's mostly just minor with borrowed tones, or even phrygian based on the occurrence of that b2. But the b5 is rare, and the tonal center is still minor. Melodically Locrian perhaps, but not harmonically."
musictheory,37is2h,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Thu May 28 17:23:34 2015 UTC,"The Slayer riff uses a pretty limited pitch palette. I don't think that you could call the flat five a borrowed tone.  As for the Anthrax examples, that's kind of the point I'm making: the pitch system results from an intersection of those three scales. There's nothing locrian about those songs (perhaps maybe for the excerpt from Imitation of Life, depending on your interpretation), but the aesthetic of ""something minor with a precedent for the inclusion of ♭2 and ♭5"" makes the style a potentially rich ground for what we're looking for.  Metallica - Wherever I May Roam - 1:25 seems fairly explicit. The only thing that I can think of that would disqualify this is that the chords themselves are power chords (just a root and a perfect fifth). You could interpret the simultaneity harmonically, though the use of the power chord in metal is more as a thickener than as a functional sonority. Supertonic chords in minor keys get the same treatment, as do leading tone chords, but the modal impetus for the music is nonetheless clear in those cases. It's not harmonized in triads, but I don't think you could deny that there is root movement in this example.  Metallica - Sad But True - 0:24 and 2:51 are both in D locrian.  Metallica - Enter Sandman - The principle riff of this song is the sort of aeolian/locrian hybrid that I was talking about. The pitches at the beginning are E E G B♭ A E, but as soon as the other guitar comes in with an Em chord, we're adding a B into the mix."
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,1 point,Thu May 28 19:49:55 2015 UTC,"These are all great examples, but they just further go to show that Locrian is really only useful stylistically or in short melodic sections, or when some other helping hand is in place (like chords underneath that still contain a perfect 5th for stability).  It's just damn near impossible to write anything truly musical sounding to Western ears while writing entirely within the confines of Locrian and actively tonicizing a diminished chord. It doesn't fit into our functional harmony. I'd like to say it can't be done but who knows, really I've just never heard anyone do it convincingly."
musictheory,37is2h,Bigfrostynugs,1 point,Thu May 28 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's just as viable as any other other mode. I cobbled together an attempt at a locrian phrase, for your consideration: https://musescore.com/user/2951556/scores/904686  (Sorry for the formatting issues, I'm new to Musescore and the online upload seems to have messed up some of the elements of my file. I'm not sure whether I can fix them post upload.)  I made sure not to cheat (borrowed tones) and to use every tone of the scale. Also, for your benefit, I harmonized the tonic as a diminished triad and included a structural dominant (measures 7-9). My opinion is that it's not tonal writing unless there's a chord progression (ruling out all that ""pedal tone"" bullshit), as well as a strong cadence (or at least the possibility of one), so that thinking is also represented here."
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,1 point,Thu May 28 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"This is very cool, but it doesn't feel like Locrian to me, it just sounds like C major with some deceptive resolutions. You don't really establish a concrete tonality in the beginning, and the diminished fifth in the tonic triad seemingly only appears as a passing tone.  The reason Locrian doesn't work is because Western music is mostly about resolving dissonances in interesting ways, but when your tonic is dissonant in and of itself, there's never any resolution. You have to approach Locrian composition and listening from a non-traditional aspect or else it isn't going to be theoretically and musically satisfying. Standard Western tonal harmony just does not add up unless your tonic triad includes a perfect fifth.  That said though, I think your composition is awesome! That's a great cadence through the 5/4 bar and on, I really like that."
musictheory,37is2h,Bigfrostynugs,3,Thu May 28 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"For improvisation, Locrian is an acceptable scale over any half-diminished chord or #11 chord. I'm a fan of using an octatonic scale deriving from locrian (with a normal 5 in addition to the dim 5) for bluesy stuff. More notes than the hextonic blues scale, so more freedom with passing tones.  Lots of metal songs use a flat 2 and a dim 5 in their licks, but that's less harmonically locrian and more melodically locrian."
musictheory,37is2h,TheChurchofHelix,2,Thu May 28 05:16:05 2015 UTC,Bjork's song Army of Me and John Kirkpatrick's Dust to Dust are good examples of Locrian mode.
musictheory,37is2h,Dude_man79,7,Thu May 28 14:49:07 2015 UTC,pretty sure YYZ by rush is in locrian
musictheory,37is2h,fuckingnumbers123,6,Thu May 28 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know why so many people are downvoting you, the introduction (up to 0:34) is clearly C locrian."
musictheory,37is2h,Xenoceratops,2,Thu May 28 07:15:46 2015 UTC,Locrian is mostly a theoretical mode and not really used...
musictheory,37is2h,Dr_Solfeggio,14,Wed May 27 23:25:37 2015 UTC,"This isn't true at all.  The ii-V-I progression, a staple of popular music in the first half of the 20th century (and jazz since then) has a minor version. In the minor version, the ii chord is generally played as a m7b5 chord, derived from the Locrian mode.  Modern tastes permit the use of a variation of the Locrian mode with a natural 2 (derived from the ascending melodic minor scale, the sixth mode).  Examples include such obscure tunes as Autumn Leaves, How Deep Is The Ocean, All The Things You Are, Alone Together, Stella By Starlight and hundreds upon hundreds of other classics."
musictheory,37is2h,ozebb,7,Thu May 28 05:15:58 2015 UTC,"while, yes the the half diminished chord is used quite a lot  and performers use the locrian mode over it, but you never really hear songs tonicize the locrian mode with the unique chord progression (like ""So What"" w/ dorian), simply because we're accustomed to the diminished chord sounding far to unstable, we yearn for it to resolve."
musictheory,37is2h,Leodhas,12,Thu May 28 07:49:17 2015 UTC,I love learning new stuff. Thanks for setting me straight!
musictheory,37is2h,Dr_Solfeggio,10,Thu May 28 05:38:27 2015 UTC,"Sure! You can certainly be forgiven for thinking that—It's often glossed over in popular theory these days as the ii-V-I has gone by the wayside in popular music.  And, admittedly, long passages in the locrian mode are pretty rare, owing to the tense and unresolved sound. Leads beautifully into a V chord, though."
musictheory,37is2h,ozebb,4,Thu May 28 05:51:28 2015 UTC,It's amazing how much I missed by getting a strictly classical music education. Good thing I've got the rest of my life to keep exploring the infinite abyss!
musictheory,37is2h,Dr_Solfeggio,3,Thu May 28 05:53:41 2015 UTC,"Well, there are plenty of jazzers out there who could likely stand to learn a thing or two about counterpoint and proper part writing, myself first among them. Cheers."
musictheory,37is2h,ozebb,3,Thu May 28 05:56:58 2015 UTC,"It's true if you are thinking about ""mode"" in any of the senses it had before the chord-scale system was made a thing. Which, incidentally, was in the second half of the 20th century, so one might doubt whether it's the only way to understand your examples..."
musictheory,37is2h,vornska,2,Thu May 28 06:11:11 2015 UTC,"But they are two different scales... Locrian and Locrian natural9 are as different as aeolian and dorian. Difference in the upper extensions of the main triad.  But locrian might be a more suitable scale choice in a minor ii-V-i since the natural 9 on the ii would be the major third off the tonic, since you brought it up."
musictheory,37is2h,Micpre,1 point,Thu May 28 07:53:18 2015 UTC,"They are. Sorry if I wasn't clear, I was only offering the Locrian natural 9 as another possibility over the half-diminished chord in the interest of completeness, as it's also considered a valid choice (depending on the effect you want—some consider the natural 9 to have a more 'modern' sound and allow more interesting voice leading).  But yes, the normal locrian mode is very much a traditional match."
musictheory,37is2h,ozebb,1 point,Thu May 28 13:34:07 2015 UTC,The locrian natural 9 scale can foreshadow or imply a picardy third.
musictheory,37is2h,BdaMann,2,Fri May 29 00:51:17 2015 UTC,"This reads like a quote right out of my beginners music theory textbook.  Learn the rules and then break them. Locrian is an awesome mode and can be used very similarly to how one would use Phrygian. It's not theoretical at all. It's very practical in Jazz as well as more chromatic compositions in blues, funk, rock, etc."
musictheory,37is2h,touchmybutt420,2,Thu May 28 16:29:43 2015 UTC,"Modes are more than one thing. Modes in the jazz chord-scale system have almost nothing to do with modes as tonalities (as you find in, e.g., folk songs or rock). Unless you're dealing with the chord-scale system, Locrian is extremely rare."
musictheory,37is2h,vornska,2,Thu May 28 16:37:36 2015 UTC,Do you have evidence against this?
musictheory,37is2h,aznstriker24,3,Thu May 28 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"I mentioned some examples in a reply to an earlier post, but in more detail here -- This recording of Stella By Starlight by Ella Fitzgerald demonstrates nicely.  The section from 1:07 to 1:24 or so (""She's all of these and more. She's everything that you'd adore."") runs through several iterations of the minor ii-V progression before finally resolving to a I. All the ii chords here are essentially of the m7b5 family, derived from the Locrian mode.  This usage was extremely common in popular music in the early- to mid-20th century, and it's still very common in jazz."
musictheory,37is2h,ozebb,1 point,Thu May 28 04:41:22 2015 UTC,thanks for the info!
musictheory,37is2h,aznstriker24,-4,Thu May 28 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"Mostly no -- the locrian mode is not very good.  It's missing a fifth!  You can write music in it if you want, but why would you?  Intellectual exercise, I guess.  That said, the Sephardic/Moroccan chant for the Song of Songs (starts at 1:00) is in locrian.  But it's not harmonic music.  The fifth is pretty indispensable, harmonically, but melodically, not so much."

I myself listened to ""Shadows Collide With People"" first, than ""Niandra LaDes and Usually Just A T-Shirt"" and onward, through ""Smile From The Streets You Hold"". After those last two, ""To Record Only Water For Ten Days"" sounded like an extremely intensive soulful progression..."
musictheory,37gzek,nwentz,0,Thu May 28 08:53:14 2015 UTC,Not all music needs guitars. But his guitar playing is the reason anybody knows of John Frusciante. So it IS disappointing to be hearing less and less of it with each new solo album of his.  Empyrean is an excellent album
musictheory,37gzek,Tommat,1 point,Thu May 28 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"As a musician, this type of attitude annoys me. It discourages growth and trying out new things. And as for ""the reason anybody knows of [him]"", that's irrelevant in my eyes.

musictheory,37kizd,bon_jover,4,Thu May 28 08:16:31 2015 UTC,"If you had such a chord progression, you'd be basically playing on top of a standard I IV V I chord progression in the key of C major. The tonality (C major in this case) is your frame of reference, and playing a melody that leads to C and is also hinting at the notes in the chords, will work greatly. Now you can use ""outside"" sounds to colour your playing. I for one wouldn't rule out playing a Bb on top of the first C major chord just to turn it into a C7 that leads beautifully to F major. You can also use ""blue"" notes to add some chromaticism to your melody (refer to the major bebop scale, which I personally adore). Flat fifths won't work that well on top of the chord progression you just mentioned. They tend to work better in minor chord progressions, at least that's what I've noticed."
musictheory,37kizd,MiguelMarquezMusic,1 point,Thu May 28 08:34:11 2015 UTC,thanks very much. Why does a Bb make the C major chord a C7 if the seventh note in a C major scale is B? (correct me if I'm wrong). And I guess I like how ugly flat fifths sound on the way into more consonant notes.
musictheory,37kizd,heidavey,2,Thu May 28 08:47:47 2015 UTC,"Not the previous poster but a B makes the maj 7 of C, while a Bb makes the dominant 7.   Cmaj7 = C,E,G,B C7 = C,E,G,Bb   If you were strictly sticking to the key of C, your F would be the F lydian which has a #4 (B rather than the Bb in the natural F major scale), which is enharmonically equivalent to the b5 :D  Have a google for diatonic harmony, but remember that music theory is descriptive not prescriptive. i.e. if you like the way a b5 feels/sounds, then you play it!"

musictheory,37gqla,nlaeae,2,Wed May 27 14:42:47 2015 UTC,"I must admit that I found his link of the scalar ""gap fill"" to the ""tonal dissonance"" of tonic vs. dominant in a classical sonata to be a bit weird.  I'm not sure what this gets him that just talking about ""gap fill"" does not.  After all, we can say ""hey, there are these two scalar collections that appear to be opposing, and later on that opposition is resolved,"" without invoking sonata procedures.  I'm not saying ""a piece must be a sonata in order for you to invoke terminology associated with sonata form,"" but I guess I just don't understand what Clement gets from that connection in this case.  As for his analyses, they definitely convince me that scalar oppositions create gaps whose filling over the course of the composition is a narrative procedure that intersects in interesting ways with the formal layout.  That said, I will repeat what I said last week: I felt all the analyses could have been more interpretive.  Temperley last month made many interpretive glosses on the works he examines that were quite suggestive, and the analyses there were invoked largely to illustrate a larger theoretical point.  Here, any theory work seems geared towards the cluster of analyses at the end (as he says in 1.6, ""The primary claims of this article are presented in the concluding series of four analyses"").  So I expected the analyses to be a bit more suggestive then I felt they were.  I was left with the question ""okay, so what does this mean?"" more often then I felt comfortable with.  But that might just be my own personal values.  As I said, Clement accomplishes what he sets out to do, and I feel like his tools do allow us to make interpretive claims about this repertoire.  In that respect, then, I think the article is successful."
musictheory,37gqla,korben_manzarek,1 point,Wed May 27 14:46:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what this gets him that just talking about ""gap fill"" does not.    Actually, I found that to be a very interesting analogy. We often think of sonata-allegro form as setting up a very large-scale opposition between 'tonic' and 'dominant', and then a resolution of same (in the recapitulation section, as the 'dominant' theme is restated in the tonic).  But there's little reason to think that the 'dominant' role must imply a literal V - particularly in pop music, there are large-scale structures that have nothing to do with I-V-I (and part of the enjoyment in listening to pop is due to this sort of variation).  One could even be provocative and say that these Yes pieces (at least, those pieces where an actual restatement/recapitulation can be found) ""might as well be sonatas"", albeit in a really broad sense. Sure, there are differences, but maybe these are the differences we would expect to see anyway as we move from classical to a pop style."
musictheory,37gqla,Leftieswillrule,1 point,Thu May 28 04:35:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Allow me to state my reservations. To me, a central aspect of the idea of ""tonal dissonance"" in sonata form is that it is generically predictive. We know the moment we hear stuff in the dominant that it will be ""resolved"" and we know when and in what way this resolution will happen (in the recap by transposing everything to the tonic). The dominant/tonic polarity thus establishes a clear set of expectations that we watch work themselves out over the course of the composition. My own personal favorite formulation of this is Hepokoski and Darcy's characterization of the structural cadence in the exposition as a ""structure of promise,"" and the analogous point in the recap as a ""structure of accomplishment.""  As I said, Clement convinces me that gaps between scalar collections should be paid attention to. But I'm not sure that I'm convinced that this narrative is ubiquitous enough to be a predictive generic feature. That is, if I hear a verse in 1# and a chorus in 1b, I don't have any expectations as to how that gap fill will be resolved, if at all. If it is filled in or resolved, then I can look retrospectively at the work and trace the filling narrative. But I'm not so certain that we can predict what is going to happen when the dichotomy is first presented to me. That I think is the main place that my reservation lies.   I think honestly my reservations would be resolved by a thorough corpus study of this music. If a scalar dichotomy is presented to us, what are the chances that it is resolved vs is left open? If it is resolved, what are the particular ways and where are the places where the resolution happens? Such a large data set would allow us to see if certain strategies are extremely common vs others that happen only rarely, and then we could probably speak of things that do induce legitimate expectations. It might be that gap fills are always resolved and in particular ways, in which case I would allow it the status that I allow the tonal dissonance in sonata forms. As it stands, I'm not convinced that we can extrapolate from the few examples we have here to make claims about how this particular concept shapes our orientation to Yes's work as a whole.   (Note, I'm not one of those people who think every problem would be solved by a corpus study. But I do think a larger corpus is warranted to make the particular claim he does about the relationship between this and sonata procedures)."

Edit: also, this portion of the article (from paragraph 3.1) might of relevance to this discussion:   at its core, smooth scalar voice leading functions as an arranging device, necessary to create seamless transitions between adjacent thematic modules (many of which were conceived independently of one another). Band members have often credited Rick Wakeman for his role in fostering these results. As drummer Bill Bruford explains (Morse 1996, 139):   [Rick] could modulate without you noticing it. He could do all the tricks that an academy guy could do. So suddenly the joins of the music didn’t seem so bad. You’d go from letter A to letter B and there’d be this horrible scrunch before. He could smooth the thing over. . . . That was a huge leap forward.    This doesn't explicitly say they understood scale theory, but it night be a useful jumping off point for this avenue of discussion.   Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!"

The only way that makes sense is if the template creator already specified dominant 7th chords for all V chords.  (i.e. you would never see G in the key of C, it would already be G7).

musictheory,37i6o6,frajen,2,Thu May 28 08:26:52 2015 UTC,"that template sounds confusing as hell, I would ask the template creators what they mean.  In C7, the distance between C and Bb is a minor seventh interval. Within the chord structure, C to Bb is a flat 7.  However, the chord Cm7 is referred to as ""C minor seventh"" which leads to the confusion. Are they talking about the chord quality, or the interval between the notes.  For majors it's a little bit better. A major seventh interval would be C to B. The chord C-E-G-B is also referred to as a C major seventh chord, or CMaj7.   But what about minor chords?    Minor chords exist in both major and minor scales. e.g. Dm (D-F-A) is made of notes within the C major scale.   Can I only use the Harmonic Minor scale? And what chords are okay in a minor key?   There are 3 commonly used minor scales, natural/harmonic/melodic. Each one generates different chords. The question you ask is incredibly difficult to answer. Harmonic and melodic minor harmonies in particular can get very complex/interesting.  e.g. The melodic minor scale's 7th chords:  C minor-major 7th (Cm-Maj7), Dm7b5, EbMaj7 #11, Fm7, G7, AbMaj7, Bdim7  The chords in italics (i mM7, IIIMaj7 #11, vii dim7) are found in all sorts of unusual contexts. For example the Bdim7 could be used in a C major chord progression. For example, C-Dm-Bdim7-C. But the Ab in Bdim7 isn't in the C major scale at all."
musictheory,37i6o6,SoSo_done,1 point,Wed May 27 22:21:40 2015 UTC,"I've included a Dropbox link with the chord charts.   I'd imagine they are trying to avoid b7 and 7ths from creating a dissonant clash when they mix and match individual stems from different composers. This is incredibly restrictive for certain genres, as the dominant 7th is, as well you know, is quite key for the sound of certain genres, especially, blues/funk/rock.  Maybe even if you are in a major key, if a minor chord is being played you can play that b7(m7) in the melody because it appears in the chord?"
musictheory,37i6o6,SoSo_done,1 point,Thu May 28 08:34:41 2015 UTC,I'd try to do this by ear/trial and error. If your not sure or it sounds off try a different note.
musictheory,37i6o6,SoSo_done,1 point,Wed May 27 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"Thats not the issue. I think they don't want the b7 in the scale degree because they are mix and matching stems from other compositions, so they're probably trying to avoid harmonic clashes between major and minor 7ths."
musictheory,37i6o6,xiipaoc,2,Thu May 28 08:28:08 2015 UTC,"So you don't have any way to check for harmonic clashes,for example by playing it with your guitar or a computer? I think, that would be the easiest way to avoid this. Generally, in the natural minor mode as well as in the major mode the 7th of all minor chords is a minor seventh. The 7th of all major chords is a major 7th except the 7th of the V chord. Flat 7th imo refers to altering the 7th to a note which isn't part of the scale like in the given example. So the bottom line is :If the chord is a V chord or, in minor mode, a VII chord  avoid the 7th.In all other cases the 7th is allowed but shouldn't be altered i.e. be part of the natural minor or major scale."
musictheory,37i6o6,Lavos_Spawn,2,Thu May 28 10:06:36 2015 UTC,"I can't check for clashes because I won't have any of the other potential stems mine could be paired with. Thats the limitation of this particular platform I suppose.  The idea is that i create a track using the provided templates, bounce out each instrument seperately and send it to them. Then, their webapp matches my stems, be it just one or many, with stems by other composers based on the template we've all used.  Its a blind, randomised collaboration basically, which i suppose will only work if everyone sticks to the guidelines.  But of course, its these guidelines which are potentially an issue, seeing as the 7th may be minor or major or flat depending on a number of different things. Its confusing!"
musictheory,37i6o6,frajen,1 point,Thu May 28 10:14:08 2015 UTC,"That sounds very cool! Imo flat seventh refers to a seventh which is a minor 7th, but is not part of the scale like the 7th of a C7 chord in the C major scale. If the 7th is part of the natural minor scale it automatically fits the rules except for the V&VII chord."

musictheory,37h8on,MiskyWilkshake,2,Thu May 28 05:58:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with others that this is more an example of very specifically notated ""free"" rhythm. Many composers use embedded tuplets and unusual syncopations as a way of indicating that the rhythm should not have a strong metered feeling. I know I've used this type of rhythm (not quite as complex) for the purpose of getting a really free, dreamy effect.   That being said, I think the trick to attacking anything complex in music is to break it down into simpler pieces. For example, if you slow down this piece and pretend each tuplet is its own measure (for example the first quintuplet is a 5/8 measure), you can work out what that rhythm is, and put it back together, pacing it so that each tuplet ""measure"" fits into the right number of macro beats. In this particular case, I do think you'll end up ""fudging it"" a bit, but this way you can at least have a feel for the general gestures within the music, and any inaccuracies can be chalked up to rubato and interpretation."

Everyone has access to pretty much the same tools as any pop musician nowadays, so there's nothing special about it in terms of the sounds they can make.

The mentality seemed to be a lot different, too. Today, the only thing that matters is image, and willingness to do whatever you're told. Back then, Art was appreciated much, much more.

That idea became really prominent in the 19th century, when music began to shift away from the aristocracy to the middle class.   In an 18th century opera house, people laughed, ate, drank, applauded mid-number, talked politics, etc. You tuned in for much of it when you heard nice music, but otherwise, you did what you wanted."

musictheory,37gxmg,Akoustyk,-4,Wed May 27 16:35:27 2015 UTC,I understand its different but you have to understand what pop means. Pop music is different than any other genre in that it changes with the time. Pop meaning popular is a referance to whatever music is most listened to in that time. 60s pop music used guitars and drums whereas modern pop is all synthetic yet they are both called pop. In this view it is easy to say that since classical music was the most prevalent that it should be called pop.
musictheory,37gxmg,manowar572,5,Wed May 27 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"It wasn't though. You could only listen to classical if you were wealthy enough to go to an opera house. It was only for the aristocracy. Popular music in that era, would have been the fiddle dance music you would find in local pubs. Some piano music, ok, but even at that, pianos and harpsichords weren't cheap. Perhaps by the end of the era it gained popularity, but I would not consider classical music to ever have been ""pop"" music, even by the definition of popularity alone.   I also wouldn't give popular music that definition either. I consider pop, to be all the genres of music, which are not like classical or movie scores or what have you, and is designed to be listened to the way pop music is, regardless of how popular it is. It's more the sort of format, to me."

musictheory,37gxmg,headless_bourgeoisie,6,Wed May 27 18:10:32 2015 UTC,"A disclaimer for taking advice found here  You're asking in a forum full of people who are either current music majors, or people working mostly in musical academia.  So keep that in mind in reading any of these responses.  The vast majority don't work in a performance related musical field, and of those that do, and even smaller slice work with pop.  Musical academia is very insular.  It tends to teach a fairly narrow spectrum of music that is largely valuable more from a historical standpoint than from any practical standpoint, but since those of us who go to college are fed a steady diet of just those things, we don't know any better, and those of us who never grow outside of that mold tend to think that that is either the entirety of music, or that it's the only thing that's important.  Why else would the entire college curriculum be about that, right?  People who don't know of any other way to study and understand music can and will only recommend the only thing they have to offer, so obviously most people are going to blindly say, ""Yes, learn all the things! o/ ""  That's even more true of idealistic college students who not only haven't been put in a position to truly see how practical their flavor of music theory is in the real world, but they also aren't looking into pop.  Additionally, even once they get out there, they just don't even know what they don't know.  So often I'm working with band/choir directors who don't recognize what's happening in music they are working on if it's more pop or jazz oriented.  Not only that, they are blissfully unaware that they don't even understand it.  To make matters worse, plenty of them (especially the students) are convinced that they are better than you.  Pop is obviously a deviant, substandard form of music for the unwashed masses in their eyes.    The importance of theory  So all that said, YES, theory is super important.  Some small portion of what you might be learning in a book including Bach could be important, but honestly, the vast majority of it is not.  Some of my pet peeves from common practice period theory that are of virtually zero practical use are parallel/direct octaves/5ths.  They are utterly irrelevant.  I guess understanding the basic idea of why from a voice leading perspective is good, but I honestly can't think of a time that I changed a musical decision out of concern for this.  You're not writing 4-part choral music, so who cares?  Another is augmented 6th chords.  Once again, interesting concept... but find me a practical use for understanding the difference between French, German, and Italian +6 chords in the wild, I dare you.  The same goes for all sorts of counterpoint stuff and on and on.  Sure, you can find pop musicians who have integrated some of these concepts, but this sort of music theory is not a starting point for someone wanting to understand theory for almost all practical performance scenarios.  You'd be better of with a resource like Contemporary Music Theory.  Funny side note, I just noticed that the author of this book I've had for years is Mark Harrison.  Hal Leonard has a Keyboard Style Series of books that are fantastic for understanding what gives certain forms of popular music their unique sound.  Among these, the best ones I've seen where those by Mark Harrison.  He gives a fantastic historical context that, in this case, is actually relevant.    It's very important for you to understand how music works from a functional standpoint.  Understanding little things about how interconnected everything is really opens doors for you as a musician.  Understanding how chords function and why (voice leading concepts you could get in a very round about way reading a traditional theory book to be fair).  Realizing why and how to use substitutions.  Little concepts about how scales work and apply to chords.    Warning about trying to ""make it""  So now I'll temper this with the realities of making it as a musician.  Too many people, especially those who are completely untrained, put all their eggs in the music basket with disastrous results.  The reality of making it at the top levels is just not in anyone's favor.  It's almost pure gambling.  In pop music, image matters more than almost anything else.  When you see a big name pop star on stage with live musicians, they are almost always the least talented person on the stage.  They just have the image.  They have star power behind them.  They shook the right hands and made it where they are largely due to getting caught in a perfect storm of zeitgeist.  Most of them aren't brilliant song-writers or musicians in any way.  They are people selected for their image and talented people write songs for them, someone else arranges it, fantastic session players record it, and amazing audio engineers make sure it all sounds good.  I've seen groups who do well locally, then start spending all of the money from their success trying to climb the ladder.  They buy better equipment, maybe travel in a locallish area... maybe move to a large city nearby and keep trying to grow.  But ultimately they spend all of the money they are making trying to ""make it"" and even if they are talented, they probably won't.  I mean, it's just true that most pop music is literally the same few chord progressions.  Almost nobody is going to make it in pop music on the brilliance of their song-writing when every year you have several very popular songs build on I-V-vi-IV or some variation thereof.  The most popular stuff isn't new or original.  But if you're a good musician and are versatile enough to play with lots of groups in lots of styles, you can make a good deal of money playing other people's music.  People are honestly more likely to pay to hear you play your own version of recognizable tunes than they are to give a shit about your originals."
musictheory,37gxmg,Yeargdribble,5,Wed May 27 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"There are many reasons music theory focuses on classical music—a big one imho is that most music theorists who have the time to do research and write books are payed by departments and schools that train classical musicians, teachers of band, orchestra, and choruses, etc. At the same time, there is a lot of research on popular music and if you’re of an academic bent you could just start by reading some of that literature. They’ll be concepts you won’t understand, but I suspect you’ll enjoy teasing those concepts out more than you'll enjoy reading pages and pages about classical repertoire. You might start here: http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.11.17.3/toc.17.3.html  On the other hand, whatever music theory you’re going to read was written with the author’s specific questions in mind. It can be frustrating if those questions aren’t your concern—you finally find some scholarship on the band whose harmony interested in, only to find the author is only concerned with text relationships. Sometimes it’s better to just devote yourself to becoming more familiar with the repertoire—learning lots of songs on an instrument, looking for similarities between them, etc. You may end up answering your own questions."
musictheory,37gxmg,mohriner,5,Wed May 27 18:36:04 2015 UTC,"I've never read that book.  In general, for songwriters, I think music theory is one of those things that you should eventually get around to. You will be able to communicate more efficiently and to a broader range of musicians, if you explain something like ""one four six five in E"" or ""bass stays on G while piano goes C7#9 E7#9""  Still, way more important is the ability to play what you hear in your head and, similarly, transcribe music. A lot of gigging rock/pop musicians don't know a whole bunch about music theory - so what then? Well, if your guitarist hits a BbMaj7 #11 and you like the sound of that chord, can you make a nice melody on top of it? If you a sing a random melody out loud, can you figure out nice chords to play underneath it? Knowing music theory might help you do these things faster or in a more logical sense. If you already have ""the ear"" for it, that's great. If not, keep reading man. Music theory just makes you a better musician in general.  Also, I think jazz/blues/rock theory lends itself towards modern pop music a bit better than (what I know about) classical theory. Probably biased here, as I never formally learned much classical music theory.  Another thing, if I was just starting out in the pop music world. I would learn a ton about production. Record a band on individual tracks (e.g. one track for guitar, one for the bass, one for each vocalist, etc.) and try to figure out what the best way to balance all the parts out are (EQing and leveling). Having an ear for balance is a skill that extends into every genre of music. I could argue that if you're really poppy (e.g. Katy Perry level pop), more important than knowing chord progressions would be to know what a high-pass filter sweep is, how reverb works, how to properly EQ/compress a chunky sawtooth synth bass with an 808 kick drum, etc."
musictheory,37gxmg,frajen,0,Thu May 28 04:46:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with most, but I don't see how jazz/blues is better for pop. Blues doesn't use western harmony and jazz is ... Well it's inspired on blues and using different chords and scales throughout. Most pop stays in one key, some goes major/minor/dominant. I don't see where you'd apply jazz-theory (unless you want to make more jazzy pop).  EDIT: 'classical' music (and the composed music before and after the classical period) uses western harmony (the western composers at least) which is the precedent of what we consider pop today. You can find some very jazzy things in their to. Bach made a lot of use of extensions used in jazz."
musictheory,37gxmg,original_nam,5,Thu May 28 08:03:46 2015 UTC,"Blues doesn't use western harmony    the blues scale and V-IV-I (or endless I-IV's, or similar progressions) are common in pop music. If you give any beginning improviser a lesson on blues scale (or pentatonics), they will instantly feel like they can create melodies over a lot of pop music. It's a basic start that I think launches a lot of people into deeper music theory   I don't see where you'd apply jazz-theory    old jazz standards are usually written with clearly defined chord progressions. Maybe ""old pop standards"" is more appropriate than jazz standards. I think it has more to do with how repetitive song structures are. You can really hammer home the concept of I-vi-ii-V in the A section of any version of ""Blue Moon"" but in classical compositions how often do you get that simple progression played almost exactly the same, on virtually endless repeat.  Also, there is a lot of emphasis when learning jazz/jazz theory on transcribing everything you hear and - by association - figuring out how to play what's in your head, mostly b/c of the importance of improvisation in modern jazz. I'm not sure how common improvisational skills are in classical music. But in general, when playing with bands today, it's more likely people are going to just play something for you and be like ""can you play with me"" instead of writing out sheet music. Again I never took classical theory but I know learning piano in a classical setting focused heavily on sight-reading and knowing how to read notes vs. ear training - ""ear training"" for me was ""can you identify this interval"" which is useful, but it was more interactive/relevant for me to do something like ""try to figure out the melody to Freebird"""
musictheory,37gxmg,frajen,0,Wed May 27 20:48:47 2015 UTC,"the blues scale and V-IV-I (or endless I-IV's, or similar progressions) are common in pop music   Blues V-IV-I isn't used that much in comparison with an authentic candense (going from V to I to end a phrase). Besides that blues uses dominant chords all over meaning the chord notes don't fit in one (7 note) scale. These dominant chords have a major-feel, and playing a minor scale over that (blues pentatonic for example) isn't something that happens in many genres that aren't related to blues. The roots of the blues are in Africa. How we fitted in our western theory isn't completely right. The typical blues bend from b3 to 3 for example isn't a full semitone, it's in between two notes we know here.  Just realized I'm not writing very coherently. Blues has some 'weird' stuff going on that isn't in most pop stuff.   I think it has more to do with how repetitive song structures are.   Easy structures are advisable to start of with, that's for sure. The I-vi-ii-V progression however isn't jazz theory. These are all chords of one major scale that sound good after each other (following the circle of fifths if you ignore the first I) and this is one of the basics in western harmony. One scale, 7 chords. Which can come after which? Lesson 2: modulation.   in classical compositions how often do you get that simple progression played almost exactly the same, on virtually endless repeat.   I'm far from knowledgeable in 'classical' music, so I don't know. What I do know is that you shouldn't study a number. You should use a number to study music. Take a piece of a song you like, loop it, play over it, try some chords, try some scales, ... learn.   I know learning piano in a classical setting focused heavily on sight-reading and knowing how to read notes vs. ear training   You are right, and that's a shame. Studying classical music doesn't need to be that though. You can learn it by ear if you like to. Classical improvisations are dying, kinda. And since nobody improvises, why bother learning by ear if you have the cheat. Google classical improvisation and i'm sure you'll come across some great stuff. In the times of great composers improvisation contests were a very normal thing btw."
musictheory,37gxmg,original_nam,2,Wed May 27 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"we're just gonna disagree. I think the blues is everywhere. So many soul/R&B influenced songs... and the samples or references in hip-hop.   What I do know is that you shouldn't study a number. You should use a number to study music. Take a piece of a song you like, loop it, play over it, try some chords, try some scales, ... learn.   personally I think it's easier to do that with a shorter song - like a 32-bar pop/jazz standard. Also, when starting out, people learn how to play a song (or a ""number""), and learning music more generally happens as you learn more songs. At least that's how I think   You can learn it by ear if you like to   You can, but... if I was new to transcribing, I'd probably shoot myself trying to transcribe most classical music. Doing single-line bebop solos was hard enough. It's easier to start with less complex music."
musictheory,37gxmg,frajen,0,Wed May 27 15:56:39 2015 UTC,Disagreeing sounds good. Blues is almost everywhere since it became more white.   I don't think you need to use songs to study theory either. You learn a concept like I-V-I and play with it. Although songs will help you understand more easily.  The most known classical music isn't exactly the most easy. There are plenty of easy songs you can use. Bass notes and melody for starters. If you know theory and your bassnotes you can make educated guesses and try stuff out.

Furthermore, I think ""creativity"" is really just the ability to make unconventional connections between all the things in your brain.  The more things in your brain, the more connections you can make, the more creative you are.  Pop music theory uses [edit: much of] the same language as classical music theory. And they share many principles: there are chords, scales, modulations, voice leading, etc.  However, not ALL of the terms of classical music are used in pop music theory, and many classical-music ""rules"" can be ignored when making pop music.  However, knowing classical music theory will help in making pop music. Personally, my jazz arranging jumped up a level when I learned Baroque counterpoint because I finally knew how a bunch of guidelines to make chords sound full.

But that doesn't mean close yourself off to anything outside your realm of current tastes. There is never a good enough reason to not listen to a piece of music, in any genre. It doesn't matter whether you are a contemporary classical composer or Taylor Swift, all music makes you a better musician, more informed, and more aware of yourself and your place in music in a historical context. Even if you hate something, figure out what it is you hate about it, and how you can use that knowledge to your advantage.   Also, if you are an aspiring pop musician (I suppose that means as a writer?) listen to every pop record that you can get your hands on, and dissect each and every song with a basic theoretical understanding so that you can internalize the elements that make up successful pop music. Think of it as field research. And use that knowledge to write more direct and purposeful songs in the vein of what you are trying to communicate. Pop is incredibly competitive, and anything that you aren't currently doing to get ahead in that field, a thousand other people are doing with a motor on their ass, churning out songs like a machine, analyzing, studying, listening, composing, arranging, recording, practicing, etc. You've got to do it all if you want to consider yourself a professional. Pop isn't ""easy"" as some people on here might suggest. But that's because being great at anything is not easy, it requires hard work and persistence, determination and a love for what you do.

musictheory,37gxmg,BdaMann,1 point,Wed May 27 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, you might be ok reading that book, it would just be more information, which wouldn't hurt you, but I would not start with that for sure.   Theory is really not that complicated, if you want to get to the level that would really help you. I could explain it to you in less than 10 pages for sure.   But you need to learn it by sound, which is more tough. Music is sound, the feel of sound, it is not logic.  But then after the basics, I think a book like that might be pretty cool. I know for a fact though, that there are many common things that happened in classical music, that I would never use to write a song. I mean, I've heard lots of classical songs, if I wanted to write that sort of thing, I would. I just never really do. But lots of it is universal, also.  But for me, in general ""reading a book of theory"" just sounds like a terrible idea. Music cannot be found in books. Theory is naming sounds, you need to learn the sounds. It's like reading a bunch of books about cooking, but then you go to cook, and you don't know what anything tastes like. How could you ever be an artist creating great recipes, if you just following some logic, without any sensitivity to what flavours and textures you are actually creating?  Idk if you want to write in your DAW, or on an instrument, but learn theory on your instrument/tool, is my advice. Learn songs, and how theory works with those. What you need to know to do that, is quite basic. I actually don't ever make use of theory when I write in my DAW. I only use it to make sense of my guitar. Except for rhythm actually, which is the opposite. On my DAW, knowing the names of what rhythm I want helps, whereas on the instrument, that just comes naturally and easily, and it doesn't matter what which rhythm is called."

musictheory,37ime1,SourWater,1 point,Thu May 28 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"Hey jaredcreado,  Personally, I find that it's best to write as many songs as possible, using many different keys and chord types, even if you are still very new to music theory.  Writing and completing songs is a way to grasp music theory.  Don't worry too much about writing anything that's amazing, but writing simple melodies and being able to say ""this is in D Major and D Major has F# and C#, and it utilizes the following chords, etc..."". If you force yourself to create a song in all of the keys and in many modes that sound good to you, you will start to become accustomed to the feeling and the sound of said key/scale/mode. If you are not comfortable with that, open up your DAW or get our your guitar (what is your instrument btw?) and reverse engineer someone else's material -- and by reverse engineering I mean learn to play it and write it down.  Choose something that is intermediate, not too hard or especially not too easy, and actually notate what you hear.  Another important thing to help you practice the intervals (tuning your ear so that you can recognize a 4th vs a 5th) is to learn and actually play all the chord types.  Start out learning how to play all of the Major and minor chords, then move to all the 7th chords, then all the sus2 sus4, 6th chords augmented, diminished etc.  You will realize that all of the chords have a distinct feel, (ie some can be happy -- major chords, some jazzy -- many 7th, 6th, and some sus chords.  One thing you may start to do is to write a song with chords (keeping track of what chords you use and how they affect the mood of the piece) and learn how to improvise over that.  You will find that some notes do not mix with the chords whatsoever, and those notes will be ones that aren't contained within the chord being played at that moment.  Just because the chord may not contain a certain note does not mean that it shouldn't be played, but it should jump out to the listener, it should be a tone that adds tension that is later released (without tension songs can become boring and predictable).  I have been playing guitar for almost 10 years, and one thing that I can tell you is that learning to improvise is key.  You can learn all the theory in the world, and be a crappy player (just ask Yngwie Malmsteen) but you need to learn how to put soul into your music and if that means breaking the rules so be it, but you must realize why breaking the rules is compelling.  This is why improvisation is so important, because you learn what sounds good and what doesn't sound good, and sometimes figuring out what lies in between those two will make your music stand out.  Hope this helps"

musictheory,37ime1,SoSo_done,1 point,Thu May 28 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"What are you doing now, and what are you learning? Music theory is a pretty broad topic and it's hard to know what kind of practice you're looking for.   If you're more of a beginner where things like identifying notes on the staff or hearing intervals and chord qualities aurally, the exercises at musictheory.net, Good-Ear and Teoria are pretty great. (The sidebar also has more online resources for this type of thing.)   If you're more at the mid-range analysis stage of things, grabbing some music from IMSLP and analyzing it is very good practice. You can do roman numerals, formal analysis (endless Mozart and Haydn sonatas....), whatever. It's also good practice for learning to read transposing scores by reading the orchestral scores (although the above resources also have exercises for transposition).   Beyond that, I think it's a matter of finding what you're interested in and just exposing yourself to that a lot. For me, since I'm married to a pianist and wanted to gain more fluency in understanding piano music, I'll often go and sit with some scores and listen to a bunch of different recordings of the same piece, to familiarize myself with some of the ways performers interpret the same music. Or, as a singer, I'll listen to multiple singers and try to pick out specific technical things they're doing - diction, timbre, ornamentation, rubato, etc. There are lots of ways you can start applying your ears and eyes to music, just depending on your interests."

musictheory,37gr1q,frajen,2,Wed May 27 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"assuming Western expectations on tonality, the answer is almost always yes.  let's first assume that for any given melody, there is a sliding scale of harmonies that start at ""completely consonant"" and slide to ""completely dissonant""  In an isolated example: melody is C-E-G  Playing a C major triad (C-E-G) underneath this would close to ""completely consonant"" and playing an F# major triad (F#-A#-C#) would be close to ""completely dissonant""  So, any given melody + underlying harmony generates some kind of mood, whether it's dissonant or consonant. I wouldn't think of harmonies are valid or invalid but rather ""do they fit the mood you're looking for?""  Playing an FMaj7 underneath the C-E-G creates a floating, positive sound; playing an Am7 or Dm7 underneath the C-E-G creates a floating, darker sound, etc. YMMV as far as moods go, but all these chords technically are in ""C major""  OK all that fluff aside.    I am writing a melody in C minor    assuming you're natural: C D Eb F G Ab Bb  One potential ""discordant"" combination that comes from this would be if your underlying chord is: D-Ab-C and your melody note is Eb.  The ""dissonance"" comes from the D being in the root and the Eb being in the melody. In a scalar sense these two notes are right next to each other. Obviously when you hit a D and Eb in the same octave, it sounds mushy. As you space the notes further apart in octaves, it might sound better. But again YMMV  You can use some knowledge of intervals to figure out what might sound good or not. In general, if you want to avoid tension, don't have a melody that's a minor 2nd (half-step) or tritone up from the root note of your chord. Carefully consider melodies that are a minor 2nd or tritone up from other notes in your underlying chords as well. One caveat to this might be the flat 7th which has become standard in blues/rock/jazz music (e.g. Ab7 or Ab C Eb Gb is a common sound in those genres and might be considered ""consonant"" in that context)   I can get some B flat based chords to sound OK with it but nothing that has its root as D or E flat works and I don't know why.    For a lot of C minor melodies, an Eb major chord will fit in perfectly. Perhaps your melody is hanging on Ab a lot? An Ab over an Eb major chord will generate a tense or suspended (""sus"") feel (depending on how prominent you are playing the G note in the Eb major chord). Please do post your melody + harmonies so we can take a proper listen : )"

Thank you for your well written answer. I don't understand chord nomenclature yet so it will take me some time to digest all this information carefully.

If the root is strongly implied or is being covered by a bass instrument, then you can work a ninth or thirteenth in there: E B D F#, or E B F# A. However, in jazz, harmony is voiced top down from the melody. Classical harmony tries to avoid parallelism, jazz harmony encourages it."

But yeah, thank you!"
musictheory,37ey4a,xiipaoc,2,Wed May 27 10:17:10 2015 UTC,"Think about voicing chords as 4 way close, containing root, third, fifth and seventh. You can substitute root for any appropriate ninth degree, and the fifth for any appropriate thirteenth or eleventh degree (dom7#11 or maj7#11). Then you can apply drop 2, 3 and 2&4 voicings to your original 4 way close voicings, depending on desired texture and the range of the lowest degree.   Things to consider are avoiding flat (minor) nines within a voicing (vertically). Also worth looking into are the low interval limits - basically, certain intervals lose character and become muddy at certain ranges. For example, the D below middle C is the lowest possible instance a major third can exist. That is to say, if you have a G major 4 way close chord in first inversion, and the B (lowest note in the voicing (3571)) is below middle C, the major third will be too low and muddy to 'speak' and provide its characteristic sound.  A great book to study is called ""Jazz Arranging Techniques"" by Gary Lindsay, which can be purchased directly from his website"

And no, that does not mean root, third, seventh, extension (though that's often a good four-part voicing).  It depends on the sound you're going for.  For example, a m9 can easily be voiced 1 5 b7 2, without the b3.  An add#4 (or add#11) chord should probably be voiced 1 5 3 #4, with the 5 in there.  You can get in some quartal chords -- chords built by stacking fourths.  Coming up with good voicings is not easy -- good luck!  For string orchestra, you can use divisis and include a lot more notes in your chords.  Doesn't mean you should.  In all cases, you should just continue to apply the basic rules of voice leading.  Dissonances should continue to be resolved in the right direction, for the most part.  You should continue to avoid parallel fifths, for the most part.  Stuff like that."

And in this style, why avoid parallel fifths? I mean, I know by doing so I get a richer sound with better voice leading, but couldn't I use it to get a particular effect?

musictheory,37ey4a,Benjabenja,1 point,Wed May 27 13:04:59 2015 UTC,"Regarding SATB, isn't it better to omit the fifth so I can use more extended notes?   Sometimes, yes.  Sometimes, you need the fifth there for other reasons.  For example, you might be going for the open fifth sound specifically.  The fifth is generally a boring note in a chord, harmonically, but it may be very important for your particular voicing from an intervallic perspective.  The example I gave with the #11 or #4 is a big one -- #4 and 5 clash.  If you take away the 5, you no longer have that clash.  If you want a smooth sound, don't use it.  If you want a rough sound, maybe you should use it.   As for the string orchestra, does that mean I really shouldn't do that or that I should just be careful about that?   It means you should be careful -- you have a much bigger range of possibilities with a whole string orchestra.  You can use double stops and you have have divisis and stuff like that.  But you shouldn't abuse that because the thinner texture of a four-note chord might be what you're looking for.   why avoid parallel fifths? I mean, I know by doing so I get a richer sound with better voice leading,   You answered your own question.  Besides, parallel fifths usually sound terrible.   but couldn't I use it to get a particular effect?   Of course you could.  But you still need to be aware of that effect.  There are times when they're OK.  The context of smooth voice leading is, generally, not one of those times.  But you may have a whole chord moving in parallel several times, for example -- that's a good time for parallel fifths.  Maybe you want to have a melody doubled at the fifth.  I like doing that -- I love the sound of doubling at the fifth!  The basic rule is that if you have a whole line in parallel fifths, that's OK, but if you just have one chord transition with parallel fifths, that's generally very bad (unless the whole chord moves together for effect)."

musictheory,37fn54,xiipaoc,2,Wed May 27 12:36:05 2015 UTC,"Actually calling it F(#11) doesn't imply a 7th or 9th.  Alterations don't imply lower extensions.  The only time something is implied is that if an extension is listed all the lower extensions below it are implied, other than the 11th not being implied when it extends all the way to the 13th.  So if it said F9(#11), then yes, that would imply a 7th.  Or if it were F13(#11), that would imply the 7th AND 9th.  F7(#11) wouldn't imply a 9th, though, nor would F7(b13).  Of course, since you typically don't have both a 5th and b13 in the same chord, that chord would be better written as F7(#5), or even F+7."

musictheory,37cn2g,thefertilepygmy,4,Wed May 27 04:03:00 2015 UTC,"As you probably know, writing a piece solely in a time signature with denominator not a power of two is essentially pointless, these time signatures are only useful when other parts of the piece are in more standard time signatures (i.e., have denominators powers of 2) because otherwise you could just convert it into a normal time signature with denominator some power of 2 and get the same thing by adjusting the tempo appropriately. So I highly doubt you'll find a piece that is written solely in 2/6 (otherwise, the composer would/should probably write it in 2/4 or 2/8 or something).  That said, I once wrote a piece mostly in 3.5/2 (notated this way because it was supposed to feel like there were three and a half beats in a measure, not 7), and that had a measure in 1/6. But I think you're looking for examples by known/notable composers. So, the wikipedia page on ""irrational time signatures"" has a number of examples of pieces with time signatures that have a denominator not a power of 2; in particular, Thomas Ades' second movement of ""Traced Overhead"" apparently has measures in 2/6.

musictheory,37cn2g,MiskyWilkshake,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"Ahh, fair enough. I remember writing a piece for a small local jazz ensemble, and although I got along with most of them, I found the pianist rather uptight and inflated (he refused to wear anything but a black and white suit on stage, no matter how it clashed the character of the music or the audience); I made sure to write him a fiendishly difficult part and even scored in a note that requires playing with his foot - oh the indignant looks he gave me!"
musictheory,37cn2g,tjmusic,3,Tue Jun 2 04:18:13 2015 UTC,"I've seen plenty of weird time signatures, especially in the electronic music world, but 2/6 would be a new one for me.  I'd love to see the score.  Without a score to guide my guess, I'm thinking it's either 12/16 as you suggested.... or....   Since the bottom number of a time signature represents a note, and those notes are fractional divisions of a whole note, a ""6"" note might be quarter note triplets.  If so, the score would look like it made sense with a 6/4 signature.  Anyway, that's the only thing that comes to my mind."
musictheory,37cn2g,20Reeds,1 point,Tue May 26 20:03:48 2015 UTC,The bottom number represents what kind of note.  2/4 = 2 QUARTER notes  6/8 = 6 EIGHTH notes  I have never heard of a sixth note before...
musictheory,37cn2g,MrMeatScience,3,Tue May 26 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"It's the same concept, albeit not (in my opinion) the best way to write it. Triplets are ""third notes"" if you want to think of them that way. 2/6 would be a meter in which 2 notes of a sextuplet comprise a bar. However, I can't say I'm aware of any in that particular meter. That being said, Conlon Nancarrow's Study for Player Piano No. 41b is in a FAR stranger meter, if I remember correctly it's got square roots and pi and things like that in the time signature."
musictheory,37cn2g,vornska,5,Tue May 26 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"The Nancarrow has nothing to do with meter or time signatures. Those are tempo canons, and the transcendental numbers describe the ratio between tempos... not meter at all."

I've found a duet by Rossini written in 2/6 time. It appears in the critical edition prepared by the Rossini Foundation. It is not a misprint. The editors believe it to stand for 12/16 (which actually makes sense). The thing is. The time signature can mean more than just number of note-shapes in a measure (e.g. it can refer to a dance type or have affective associations). So I was wondering if anyone knew of any example of a piece notated in 2/6.
musictheory,37cn2g,nmitchell076,2,Tue May 26 18:33:05 2015 UTC,What piece?   And like it is a shorthand for 12/16? Or did the 1s get smudged off or cut off of something?
musictheory,37emv2,W357Y,2,Wed May 27 01:49:48 2015 UTC,"""Original tempo"" as in whatever you were doing before a disruption like a rit. or an accel. If you really want to specify back to the original tempo of the piece, ""Tempo Primo"" would be unambiguous.  Grove, which is fairly authoritative, defines ""a tempo"" simply as ""An instruction to return to the previous tempo after a deliberate deviation."" But the Oxford Dictionary of Music (also part of Oxford Music Online) defines it as ""Denotes reversion to speed at beginning of piece or movement after a deviation."" So even the same online resource isn't perfectly consistent. I suspect that in both cases they have the same thing in mind: resetting to a consistent tempo after a localized disruption."
musictheory,37emv2,vornska,1 point,Wed May 27 03:11:14 2015 UTC,"If the tempo has temporarily changed, ""a tempo"" means to return to it.  So for example if there was a rit. or a rall. or a cadenza or some interruption in the flow, ""a tempo"" means to get back to the flow.  I transcribe a lot of soloistic music, where part of it is in a kind of arbitrary, slow tempo.  I generally mark that ""Rubato"".  Some passages are in a strict beat, and I mark those ""A tempo"".  I think that's a good indication of what the word means.  Tempo I means that you were in a tempo, you changed permanently to another tempo, and now you're returning permanently to the first.  The first tempo wasn't interrupted; it changed."

musictheory,37aden,ReadMyNameBackwords,16,Tue May 26 03:59:49 2015 UTC,It's a double plagal progression or a IV/IV (just like a V/V). It's super cliché in rock ballad because the Beatles used them a lot.
musictheory,37aden,JollyBard,25,Tue May 26 05:45:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's less modal and more about harmonic motion. Listening to that part of the song, it doesn't strike my ear as ""in a mode"". What stands out is the bVII-->IV functioning as a IV/IV. And that VI->I resolution (I don't think it should be called a plagal cadence btw) is really strong, especially to the average pop listener.   With less jargon, the Eb chord is interesting for two reasons: first it's a bit of a surprise, and second it ""pulls"" to the next chord in the progression, the exact same way the Bb chord pulls back to F.   Also, the melody hits a G as soon as the Eb chord happens, which helps."
musictheory,37aden,ethanjhayward,5,Tue May 26 04:38:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds right to me. The Beatles had used longer chains of IV->I before too. In A Day in the Life (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPSR9K7tzPc#t=2m39s), after ""went into a dream"", the chord progression is C G D A E (last one possibly Em), four iterations of going down a fourth."
musictheory,37aden,masharpe,3,Tue May 26 07:01:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. Can you explain what you mean by functioning as a IV/IV?
musictheory,37aden,ethanjhayward,4,Tue May 26 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much theory background you have but let me try to ELI5 it.   Harmonic motion is all about X chord ""pulling"" to Y chord. You can use many different words to describe this feeling--X chord leads to Y chord, X chord is tension and Y chord is release, gravity, etc.   The most common example of one chord harmonically ""pulling"" to another is the V7 chord going to the I chord (also known as the dominant chord going to the tonic chord). So in the key of C, that's a G7 chord leading to a C chord.   Well suppose you take that progression, G7->C, and you wanted something to ""pull"" to the G7 chord. You could add ITS V7 before it, and make it D7->G7->C. This D7 chord is called a ""secondary dominant"", because it pulls to C's dominant the exact same way C's dominant pulls to C. In roman numerals, secondary dominants are labeled ""V/V"", or ""five of five"". Think of this as ""the dominant chord OF the dominant chord.""   Well, in the Hey Jude example, we're not chaining together two V7 chords, we're chaining together two IV chords. The IV-I motion has pretty strong harmonic pull as well. In this case, the Bb-F is the IV->I (otherwise known as subdominant to tonic), and the Eb-Bb is the IV/IV->IV (that's ""four of four to four"").   So Eb->Bb->F, in roman numeral speak, becomes ""the four of four"" moving to ""the four"" moving to ""the one.""  Hope this makes sense."

musictheory,37aden,Jazzerbone,2,Tue May 26 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"That means the Eb functions as the subdominant IV chord relative to the IV (Bb) of the original key (F). Another common example is V/vi such as if you played an A chord in the key of F (the A being the dominant V chord of the relative minor, Dm)."
musictheory,37aden,bananasandpie,12,Tue May 26 12:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. It may fit the word ""modal"" on paper but nothing about it actually sounds modal. You could call it borrowing from the relative minor, but do you really think Paul McCartney was thinking about that when it was written? I feel like that's over-thinking it.   It's a good sound change or surprise. The voice leading is cool and breaks all of the parallel rules (F --> Eb), and it leads to the Bb chord in a way that makes the Bb chord almost sound like a tonic. /u/ethanjhayward is on point here I think."

musictheory,37aden,PhilipK_Dick,7,Tue May 26 06:23:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why that rule gets thrown around so much... It's only a ""no-no"" if you're trying to promote counterpoint, in as much as it promotes melodic voice independence. Further, writing in pure counterpoint is only done as an exercise by music students anymore as it's a composition style that's fallen out of major practice for 400 odd years. Counterpoint is just another tool for composers now... So %70 of the time it basically doesn't apply."

It had been considered more interesting to have voices that move up and down (non parallel) to get to the next harmony.

musictheory,37cqy8,Debusatie,0,Tue May 26 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"He transposes them over from Ionian mode (major) to Aeolian mode (minor) and vice versa. Debusatie explained this really well, but to explain it myself:  Say you want to convert something in C minor (relative is Eb major), to C major. For this, you need to know the scales:  C minor: C D Eb F G Ab Bb C  C major: C D E F G A B C  So basically you take the third (Eb), sixth (Ab), and seventh (Bb) and raise them each by a half-step. What this guy does is he takes the songs and does this; raises those specific notes/intervals in the scale up by a half-step to change them into major.  Now on your question on how can one ""translate"" songs like this, you can do it with any mode. For instance, lets say I want to play a song written in C major, but I want to transpose it to Ab harmonic minor (minor scale with a flat 7th), I would change it based on root note, so if some of the notes were, say, C E F A in the C major pattern, to transpose to Ab harmonic minor, I change the root from C to Ab, and play the same scale degrees in the different scale, which would be Ab B Db and E."
musictheory,37b1jc,imdefinitelystupid,3,Tue May 26 08:40:01 2015 UTC,"Can you whistle, hum, or sing? Then forget the theory stuff for a minute. Just sort of start whistling something that sounds like you want your game to sound.  That's your melody line. Once you've got it (and whistle it a few times so you don't forget it), go pick out that line on a keyboard   (FYI: go download MuseScore 2.0.1. If you don't have access to a physical keyboard, MuseScore's on-screen keyboard will make this job somewhat easier if you.)  Once you've got your melody line, use what you learned about music theory to refine it and identify a suitable chord progression to go under it."
musictheory,37b1jc,p2p_editor,4,Tue May 26 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"You haven't played an instrument before? That's something I would look into changing.  Since you know chords and chord progressions, I'll give you a simple way to turn those chords into melodies. Every chord is composed of chord tones. As an example, a C major triad is composed of the notes C, E, and G. You can make a melody out of these chord tones by playing them individually. The melody could be something like C E. You can ornament the chord tones by putting ""non-chord tones"" between them. A non-chord tone occurs between two chord tones and must be adjacent to a chord tone. In the melody line C D E, D is a non-chord tone. It leaves C by a step and approaches E by a step. Another example is C B E. B is a non-chord tone that leaves C by a step and approaches E by a leap. The opposite would be C F E, where F leaves C by a leap and approaches E by a step. I've outlined these melodic variations here. A non-chord tone must always have a stepwise relationship with a chord tone. C A E is not a valid melody on a C chord, because A leaves C by a leap and approaches E by a leap. Since there is no stepwise relationship, the resultant melody will not be smooth.  As a beginning exercise in melody writing, I suggest you write a four-measure chord progression and then realize a melody that matches it. You would start with something like this. G C G Em Am D G, it's a chord progression in G major, right? What you're going to do is figure out what the chord tones are for each chord. Write them out somewhere like this:  G = G B D  C = C E G  Em = E G B  Am = A C E  D= D F# A   Next, try to string the chord tones together in a way which creates motion. For example, when you are going between the G chord and the C chord, some good melodic movements are B-C, D-E, G-E, G-C, D-G, and B-G. The only choice that is inadmissible is G-G, because it is the same note and therefore there is no motion. Write a single melody note for each chord and only use chord tones. Your  first attempt might look something like this. This will likely be a pretty boring melody. Next, fill in the rhythm with quarter notes and stick with chord tones. Have the last note of your exercise be a half note. Here is a solution that I came up with, given those parameters.  Eventually, you'll want to use non-chord tones to give yourself a little more flexibility. This is the same solution, except I've changed the first measure. Instead of G B D B, I've changed it to G D C B. C is the non-chord tone. Remember the rule for non-chord tones: they must occur between two chord tones, and they must have a stepwise relationship to at least one of those chord tones. The non-chord tone can occur between two different chords, but it must follow the rule of stepwise relationship. I'll leave you with a couple more melody realizations to use as references:  1  2"
musictheory,37b1jc,Xenoceratops,3,Tue May 26 10:59:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you so much for the information! I would like to learn the piano / keyboard, looking forward to when I can afford a decent one.  I followed your steps and came up with the following: each chord with a single melody note and each chord with quarter notes (& a use of a non-chord tone). How does this look to you? Also, should there be any relation between my 2 exercises I linked? When I was completing exercise 2, I did not use the single notes I had created in exercise 1.  To make a simple song using this melody, what other elements do I need to create? I know that I'm painfully unaware of song structure and basic knowledge, so I'm sorry if anything I'm saying is make you roll your eyes. Thanks again for the writeup!"
musictheory,37b1jc,Xenoceratops,2,Tue May 26 14:59:26 2015 UTC,"It's good. All of the chord tones are correct and your non-chord tone is effective. I'd say that you learned the materials on musictheory.net well. Next, let's work on tightening the melody up. First, permit your melody one high point and one low point. By this, I mean that after you finish your melody, scan it for the highest note and the lowest note. If there is more than one of either, then change the melody so that there is a higher/lower note than what you have written, or that some of the notes that you already have come up or down as needed. See my realizations as an example. Secondly, the seventh note (also called the leading tone) of the scale (in G major, this is F#; G A B C D E F# = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) should usually resolve up to the key note G. Try also to limit redundancy. Your  quarter note melody contains four D's and four B's. Find a way to cut down on those numbers either through different chord tones or non-chord tones. Lastly, I encourage you to employ cadences at the ends of your phrases. Cadences are groups of particular chords that signal the end of a phrase. These include the Authentic Cadence (V I or vii° I; in G, this is D G or F#dim G), the Plagal Cadence (IV I; C G), the deceptive cadence (V vi; D Em), and the half cadence (any chord, and then V; x D).  Your melodies don't have to be related, but feel free to continue revising your compositions until they fit your liking. Part of the purpose of this exercise is to show you the great number of combinations that you can make with chord tones in a single progression, and knowing that increases your creative options. However, that's secondary to learning how to write a melody. The form stuff will come if you keep writing these four-measure things. Most musical phrases occur in multiples of 4. Later on, I'll help you to turn your melodies into something organized closer to a complete song. For now, keep writing melodies so that you have something to work with. You might want to download a program such as Finale Notepad so that you can hear your work.  Since you want to learn the piano, I recommend you check out /r/piano if you haven't already. I think their recommendation on inexpensive electric pianos is the Casio Privia PX-150 or PX-130. A full 88 weighted keys seems to be important. As you don't have an instrument yet, you have a unique limitation that you can exploit. Train your ear and learn to sing movable solfege syllables (Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti). Sing your melodies to yourself and internalize the pitch relationships. This will help you throughout your musical development."

Based on your reply, I focused on:   Having a cadence at the end of my melody's phrase Making my work less redundant Not having multiples of the highest and lowest note Resolving my leading tone(s)   I ended up with the following example finished, but then realised I hadn't resolved either of the F#s, so came to the following melody.  I used an authentic cadence (V - > I) in the final bar. I find it difficult to distinguish between phrases. Should I have used a cadence at other points in my melody or is this sufficient?  My melody is quite different since my last reply as I tried to fit the criteria (particularly repeating notes, where I ended up repeating 3 Ds and 3 As anyway :/)  Finally, I'm not sure I fully grasped this:   First, permit your melody one high point and one low point. By this, I mean that after you finish your melody, scan it for the highest note and the lowest note. If there is more than one of either, then change the melody so that there is a higher/lower note than what you have written, or that some of the notes that you already have come up or down as needed.

musictheory,37b1jc,0xe4524ffe,2,Fri May 29 20:57:32 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the late reply, I'm eager to improve but don't want to half-ass my work, so I've been waiting to get enough time to give this exercise my full attention.   It's all good, man. Thanks for taking this so seriously; your desire to learn and improve is evident.   I ended up with the following example finished, but then realised I hadn't resolved either of the F#s, so came to the following melody.    (Yes, that is an escape tone. Typically, escape tones and appoggiaturas resolve the opposite direction of the leap though.)  Both are actually okay in this case. The important thing is that the resolution happens when there is a chord change. I made a diagram to explain.  • In the first example, there is an F# at the beginning of the measure, and it moves down to D. This is acceptable, because is moving within the chord. Because we're still on the D chord, F# D is a perfectly reasonable melodic movement. Ditto on the F# A at the end of the first measure. Those are also justified by the fact that both the F# and the A are technically resolving to G. Consider that F# and A are ""surrounding"" G. At that point, it’s sort of like there are two “micro-melodies”: F#-G and A-G. The leading tone resolution is slightly delayed.  • The second example is more of what I instructed you to do. The leading tone resolves directly, so there's no ambiguity.  • The third example is incorrect because the leading tone is active at the end of the measure and we expect it to resolve, but then it goes somewhere completely different.   I used an authentic cadence (V - > I) in the final bar. I find it difficult to distinguish between phrases. Should I have used a cadence at other points in my melody or is this sufficient?   Cadences are harmonic. Your last two measures have the chord progression G Bm | Em G. These chords don’t make any cadence. Try using these progressions instead:  Authentic cadence: G D | G  Plagal cadence: D G | C G  Half cadence: G C | D  Deceptive cadence: G D | Em   My melody is quite different since my last reply as I tried to fit the criteria (particularly repeating notes, where I ended up repeating 3 Ds and 3 As anyway :/)   Both melodies are markedly improved. I don't think that you have too many D's or A's. It's a good amount. What I want you to look at now is the melodic contour: you start at a low point, gradually work your way up to a high point, then come back down to the low point again. This is very good. What you don't want is a melody that starts low, goes high, goes low, then goes high, then goes somewhere in the middle, on and on without a clear direction. Both versions of your melody show good contour.   Finally, I'm not sure I fully grasped this:  I took this as ensuring I my highest note and lowest note do not repeat - except with G. I felt I should start and end on G, but I'm not sure if this was the right thing to do   You interpreted my meaning well. Sorry, I was being a little too verbose there. Also, your instinct is correct: it is good to begin and end a melody on the same note, and this overrides the ""only one highest/lowest note"" rule. The main thing is that the highest/lowest note of the melody does not occur more than once in the middle of the melody, because then the dramatic value of those notes is diluted.   Finally, when finishing this new melody, I didn't know whether to shift the higher up notes (G, A, B in the 3rd measure) down an octave or leave them be. Is there a means to choose which octave the note should be in, or is it just personal preference?   Personal preference. However, melodies usually have logic. A good general rule is to keep the entire melody within the range of an octave, with the occasional step above or below that range. This, for instance, is a good “tessitura” (range of a melody):   (F#) G A B C D E F# G (A)  The parenthesized notes are the notes you can use occasionally at the top and bottom of the tessitura. Since your lowest note is G, you can bump it up a little:  G A B C D E F# G (A) (B)   Again, thank you for your time and your help!   You’re welcome. When I have time again, I’ll help you to synthesize this stuff into phrases, periods, and sections. Then, you stick the sections together and get something that sounds like a song.  I gotta say, I’m very impressed by how much you’ve picked up in this short amount of time. Good job, internet stranger."

musictheory,37ciwu,Debusatie,1 point,Tue May 26 17:45:19 2015 UTC,I kinda still don't understand. Is this used to spic up the chords and make it sound not so repeating or so? Are there any links on this topic that could explain a bit further?
musictheory,37ciwu,Debusatie,1 point,Tue May 26 18:43:34 2015 UTC,"Well, no its not merely used for ornamentation, it is the single most important function of tonal harmony - as in, almost all of western music theory is based off the relationship between tension and resolution. If you were to have a song that never resolved, it'd sound very strange and unpleasant to untrained ears.   So, the most basic form of resolution is the relationship between the dominant chord, (also known as the V chord, which starts on the fifth degree of the scale...in the key of C it'd be G), resolving to the tonic (the I chord, C).  If you play a C major chord for a few bars, then play a G major chord, ask yourself what chord would come next. Where does the progression naturally want to go? The answer is back to C. Your home base.   Now try playing these chords:  C, A-, D-, G...  What comes after the G? If you leave it on the G, that's okay, but it feels and sounds unresolved - it feels shaky and unstable. It again wants to go back to that C chord to complete the progression.  tl/dr: Your chord of resolution, in its most basic function, is the final chord of which all other chords are being pulled to."

musictheory,377p19,ImpermanentMarker,10,Mon May 25 15:43:20 2015 UTC,"The leading tone refers to the characteristic action that the note performs, it's function: it leads to the tonic. The subtonic refers to its position relative to the tonic. Position and function describe different aspects or properties of the same thing. Though in musical lingo, the two can and often are used interchangeably. So to speak of the subdominant is to speak of a ""pre-dominant"" function, but we often invoke one and imply the other. And in the case of Tonic and Dominant themselves, one name communicates both position and function. So it's tricky.   The distinction is helpful in minor, when the leading tone (#7) is used to refer to a different note from the subtonic (b7)."

musictheory,377p19,AlexBagheri,7,Wed May 27 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"The scale degrees have names based on their function. If we just focus on Aeolian and Ionian, we can see that the third has the same function in each, as a third of the tonic. The chord itself is different, but since the major third and minor third both sit nicely on top of the tonic, or the IV7, or even a really rare V6 chord, the name won't change."
musictheory,377p19,SocialIssuesAhoy,15,Mon May 25 16:11:57 2015 UTC,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe its ""proper name"" is ALWAYS subtonic, whether it's raised, lowered, or neutral. The whole scale naming is Latin and it's no exception.  ""Leading tone"" is more of an informal/descriptive name. It's incredibly useful for teaching because it can be associated with what it does. Just like how I call tonic the ""home pitch"" sometimes."
musictheory,377p19,nmitchell076,9,Mon May 25 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"People will often use leading tone to refer to #7 and subtonic to refer to b7 when a piece is in the minor mode. It's usually clear to use the distinction in this way, so I don't see a problem with it. There isn't a single best way to use a term objectively for all cases (at least where music is concerned). There's just more and less clear ways of using it depending on the context."
musictheory,377p19,SocialIssuesAhoy,5,Mon May 25 17:00:04 2015 UTC,Right that's what I was trying to say. It's always the subtonic but calling it the leading tone when it's a half-step below tonic is very useful for showing its functionality and the name clearly has caught on.
musictheory,377p19,romericus,1 point,Mon May 25 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"Another thing to keep in mind is that the names of the scale degrees are descriptors of distances:   The supertonic is a whole step above; subtonic, a whole step below.   The mediant is a third above; the submediant, a third below.  The dominant is a fifth above; the subdominant, a fifth below.   The descriptor of leading tone implies it's function in a more meaningful way. It's hard to describe the function of the mediant by it's name alone, because regardless of whether it's raised or lowered, it's still the third of the tonic chord.   Interesting tidbit, Schenker sometimes referred to scale degree 2 as the descending leading tone, outside the context of the Phrygian/Neapolitan 2. But I prefer to only use this term for b2, as the term ""leading tone"" seems to have become so ubiquitous for describing half-step motion, that it would be confusing to many."

I would generally say that the lydian #4 is not a subdominant, but it's a step below the dominant so I'm not really sure.  The phrygian b2 is definitely a supertonic, but I would actually also call it a leading tone, since it has a similar pull towards the tonic that the 7 has."

Because ""subtonic"" does mean ""below the tonic"", and the subdominant is below the dominant.  On the other hand, ""submediant"" is the mediant below rather than above.  It's inconsistent terminology.  But, that said, in the case of the subdominant, ""subdominant"" does the literal meaning of ""below the dominant"" (among its many meanings), so it wouldn't be wrong to say that a #4 is the ""subdominant"".

Guitar instruction is ... ""unique"" ... when it comes to theory.  Basically learning theory on guitar kinda feels like running in a maze, except there is no exit because you have been chasing round these scale shapes for years and then you realize that these help you in no way compositionally.  At the very least theory is more accessible on the piano and is much easier to learn ( the notes are just there not scattered all over the fret board).  If your interest is to just strum some songs then skip all the theory BS and just learn the songs.  But if you are as your question suggests inclined to compose then try the piano first, get the basics, then come back to the guitar.  After learning the like ten or so basic chord shapes you will realize how easy the guitar is and be set with a solid theoretical base (trust me that's something I wish i had!)."

musictheory,3768jt,phalp,1 point,Mon May 25 20:15:48 2015 UTC,I'm not really seeing the connection with the four-dimensional hypercube. The choices seem arbitrary.
musictheory,3768jt,Talking_Meat,1 point,Mon May 25 20:54:56 2015 UTC,"Think about the space of dyads. For extra clarity, suppose two different instruments: a flute and a clarinet. It's possible to make a two-dimensional chart of the dyads the instruments play in a piece of music. The x coordinate of each point on the chart would correspond to a note played by the flute, and the y coordinate would correspond to the note played by the clarinet. We could use MIDI note numbers to represent the notes, and it would be very easy to make a plot of all the dyads in the piece.  That's the basic idea here, except that the plot is four-dimensional (because the chords have four notes), it is ignoring octave, and it is ignoring the order that notes appear in. That is, it's making C, E, G, B the same point as C, G, E, B, and any other permutation of those notes, regardless of the octave they appear in. This is four-note chord space.  When you plot the chords in this piece, you can see that they are a subset of the vertices of a hypercube (I don't think Chopin uses all the vertices in this piece). There are more chords in four-note chord space, which would be represented by additional balls, which aren't depicted. The points which are displayed, i.e. the vertices of the hypercube, are a minor third from the points they're connected to. The top and bottom points represent the same chord root. So if you take 4 steps along edges of the hypercube, you can get the root back to where you started.  I think he's got another video where it explains it all in detail.   The choices seem arbitrary.   Well, Chopin's choices about how to move through the hypercube were basically arbitrary, except that at the beginning of each pass through it, he uses a consistent pattern. That's what's neat about this analysis. You can see visually how he starts the same way, then meanders through a different route until he's back where he started, each time. And you can also see visually which other chords would have fit ""in the system"" he was using and how much of it he explores in this piece."

Mozart, for example, counted the number of measures in every piece in one of his operas, and added the numbers to check the proportions of the piece — his pieces use a formulaic approach. In studying him, I had many a-ha moments about how music works. For instance, Mozart will use 4 measure phrases to end pieces, etc. The more I analyze music, the more I see that good music is written with a logically coherent architecture. Logic and number crunching is an integral part of composing, and is just as, if not more, important than emotion. Both emotion and logic ""guide"" the composer in creating music.   And I like music, so I'd want to know more about it. It doesn't mean we all have to be music theorists, but both options are fine."
musictheory,3768jt,FloatyFloat,1 point,Wed May 27 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"I think all of those things will come with feel. It is in a sense magic. A computer cannot write great music, even though you could program all theory into it. Because a computer is not struck with how music feels, which to me, is the important part.   Mozart most certainly composed with feel. He would write entire pieces multiple instruments at once, on the fly, with no mistakes.   I don't think any theory or analysis should ever be the reason for doing anything. The reason should always be what you feel, and what you want to feel.   It just so happens, that if you follow that, a number of tendencies will appear. But if you tried to formulate a sentence based on tendencies, you would be hard up to say something clever. Even if all clever things may share tendencies. It's not just sort of math or numbers or anything like that. If one tries to compose that way, I think it will always come off as cold or generic. That is not to say you couldn't find patterns, it is to say, patterns should not be the motivation, because patterns are not music and how music strikes you and the number of variables is very high, so working in that way, will inevitable encounter something that isn't quite awesome. It will always ""work"", but writing great music, is writing something that ""works"" any more than writing a novel is about writing coherent sentences."

Allusion to computers and their cold hearts (and simple brains) is a red herring.  The argument is that through mental processes of categorization, working with forms, planning, etc., we can more reliably produce music that does what we want and better understand it.  They are tools to help the more elusive creative forces work their stuff.  That's the whole idea of this sub."
musictheory,3768jt,-x-x-checkers,1 point,Wed May 27 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a red herring. Computers have access to all theory, but only theory, and they cannot write beautiful music.   Human beings can make beautiful music, not because they know theory, but because they are struck with how music affects them, and they use that, to design their pieces.   I would never ever make any sort of musical decision based on theory. I don't even use any theory, when I compose on my computer. I use it only to know where the sounds I want are on my guitar. I don't use it to help figure out what sounds to want.   That's not songwriting, to me."
musictheory,3768jt,Akoustyk,1 point,Wed May 27 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Music theory is, in essence, breaking down a large body into comprehensible rules* that can help to understand the whole. If you can break it down into a logical set, surely you can build up these ingredients to form a whole piece again.   Using theory for composition is not impossible, and actually makes a lot of sense. Am I saying you'll never use emotion as a composer? Not at all, and I wouldn't think most people would say this, either -- as human beings, it impossible to act, in any way, that is dictated purely by logic. We are emotional beings. That said, we don't need to throw all logic out the window, and it would be a poor decision to do so.   Consider that you are writing a piece, and it contains a series of chords, getting more dissonant. The emotional part of you has decided that what you want next is to resolve it. Yet, how do you do this? I suppose you could strike random combinations of keys until you find one that does the job, but the better way would undoubtedly be to use some system of rules to help you. Knowing that two notes a half step apart sounds really harsh and grating, for example, rules out that possibility. Knowing that triads sound pleasant might add some consideration to using elements of them as your next chord. There are many more rules that can guide you, but these are two undisputable, simple examples.   You don't need theory to know what will work, though. Whether you study music theory or not, if you have spent enough time composing, you'll probably have some feeling that this nice, non-dissonant chord can be accomplished by using a triad chord. This is because, whether you realize it or not, your brain is constantly revising its understanding of what music fundamentally is, every time it encounters new data from a musical piece. If you look at music history, you notice that it started out with pieces only containing a few note possibilities. Even a triad is not popular if you go back far enough. Adding a 7th was seen as dissonant or unpleasant, and 9ths were even more unbearable. Eventually, these became acceptable composition, but the point is that the brains that heard music in the past, heard rules being broken. As time went on, the rules were revised, in a sense, to accommodate 7th and 9th notes and other ""unpleasantly dissonant"" sounds (7th and 9ths are used in music composition at this point, but primarily for a dissonant, dark, tense feeling. It's not really until America sees slavery that these structures work their way into music as ""pleasant"" sounds -- jazz tunes today feature loads of 7ths, but can be crazy happy). Essentially, your brain works via pattern recognition, and so over your composing career, you have given it a plethora of data to pull from, allowing you to make that educated guess that ""I should use a triad to resolve this tension."" Yes, your emotion guided your decision to increase the tension and then resolve it, because there's no rule that says you had to dissolve the tension from that second to last chord; you could have kept it, if that's what you wanted. That's the emotion, though, telling you that you specifically wanted this in this moment of this piece. And your emotion does that job well. But for knowing how to accomplish these goals, that's where rules made from analyzing patterns (consciously or subconsciously) will help.   Also, consider that your musical decisions are opened by studying the theory in music. One person may decide that they want a triad. Another, who has studied theory and has more rules to pull from, knows that, while a triad will work, a much more interesting option is to alter one note to make a slightly different combination. Learning about the theory of music opens you up to these possibilities. Yes, I suppose you could just listen and compose enough to develop a sense for these more complex options in music. That's what I did when I played in a jazz combo, and it was how I thought. But this assumed that I would hear every possible combination and stick it to memory, or that my ear would be able to discern every nuance (surprise, it can't. I learned this after a few years when I started trying to solo over the more complex, dissonant stuff).  One example of how powerful music theory is, comes from when I was back in a jazz band, and someone was missing a part. There was no Trumpet 3 sheet music in the folder. My instructor, with his years of study, took a look at all the trumpet parts together, and devised an entire Trumpet 3 part on the spot. Could I have done that? In a sense, yes. But I may have chosen notes that would have been boring, or broken the feel. Sticking to the root notes, for instance, would have resulted in technically ""correct"" chords, but would get really old, really quickly. Another example comes from when we received a visit from a music student in CSUN's Jazz A band (he's since graduated and is touring, but he was very knowledgeable already in his college days). He dropped by one day to help improve the sound of our band, and we got to a particularly layered chord. Now, these kinds of chords require that every part is in tune, or else the whole chord fails. Well, we weren't good enough to do this, which became increasingly apparent after a couple run-throughs. On the spot, this guy started shifting notes around, changing everyone's parts for that one chord, to achieve a similar sounding chord with more ""space"" for wrong notes. This is the knowledge that music theory gets you. It's definitely possible to compose purely with emotion, and nobody's advocating that one should compose without it. But by studying the fundamentals of music, and learning the rules more in depth than just what your ear can make out, you widen your understanding, listening, and composing possibilities.   As an aside, while human beings are incapable of composing based on pure logic, it is definitely possible to do so. Consider Emily Howell, who computationally composed these pieces. Well, not really ""who composed;"" I guess I should have said ""which composed,"" seeing as Emily Howell is a computer that, after analyzing hundreds of musical scores, devised a set of rules to describe them and composed pleasant-sounding pieces from this data.  These kinds of rules aren't limited to music theory, either. Computers today can also write news stories, books, and even poetry. (or, if you define poetry as words written in emotion, then computers can produce output that mimics poetry in its structure, themes, and other qualities that we commonly ascribe to poetry.) As computers can't use emotion, the existence of these outputs means that they could only have devised output as computers do: computation and logical rules.   *(I want to clarify: they're not rules in a sense of steadfast laws. They can be broken, and that's historically how music has progressed. However, it's a matter of how much they can be bent and broken, to what degree. If you hit a bunch of dissonant notes, playing 10 notes all next to each other in one chord, people will call that ""dissonant"" or ""bad"" today, tomorrow, and probably forever. However, maybe in the future, just as we see in modern times when looking at the past, some of these rules may disappear. Perhaps playing a root and the next two half steps, all in one chord, will be ""pleasantly dissonant"" in the way a jazz m7 chord is pleasant now. Still, this example illustrates that while the rules can be broken, they certainly exist and have some bearing on musical composition and reception.)"

I don't consider full chords to necessarily be dissonant. I mean, I know that's the word people use, but I don't like that word. To me dissonant sounds bad, and lush or full or complex chords sound great in the right way. I don't like miles davis, but I like Joe Pass. So, for me, a lot of sort of fusion, is stuff I am simply not interested in.   Theory is not options for me to pull from. It is the way to manifest the option I decided on already. I intend, theory helps me execute. I don't use theory to help me decide, or be a set of options. That's how band in a box writes music.   I wasn't saying it was not possible to write logically, I was saying I don't think that is artistic, and misses the point of art, so I don't practice that.   I know computers can write music, but not good music. That's the point. If computers could write good music, that software would exist, and top composers and songwriters would be out of a job.   I don't consider there to be rules, rules that can't be broken or otherwise. Just names of sounds, that's all."

I mean things like this."
musictheory,3768jt,Akoustyk,2,Mon May 25 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, you might be able to find patterns and things like that in music, make many observations about given pieces, but that is not necessarily saying anything at all about music in general, really. So, it might be helpful for playing a given piece, but it is generally not helpful for writing anything or improvising anything.   One could use observations that way. But, for me, that makes no sense. It would be like making observations about the way people speak, which words come after which other words, and uses those observations to decide what to say. Whereas, what one chooses to say, is specific, and it's quality depends on the meaning and how it is conveyed, not on the application of any previously observed tendencies in speaking.   There is no real ""a-ha"" moment in what people choose to say, although if you applied yourself, you could likely find many sort of patterns or tendencies, and things like that. i don't mean that they would be false patterns either, or false observations, like finding a pattern that isn't there. I just mean that you might find a pattern, and that pattern is in fact pertinent to that specific piece, but it works with that piece, because of what that piece is, and will not necessarily be applicable to other pieces, and if such patterns are applied to other pieces in that way, that misses the whole spirit of writing music, to me. Even though, in the writing of music as an expressive form of art, every songwriter will decide to write things which do follow common traditions, due to the nature of music. Just like people will do with speech, but those patterns to not define what is said, it is just that what is said, tends to follow certain patterns. Right? Nobody thinks of speaking as ""which words 'work'"" or anything like that. We just say the message that comes to mind without paying attention to any of that."

If you want to learn about theory, then you need to learn the roman numerals, about the key, and the roles degrees have. Then you will be in a position to learn a couple other things.

Just as an idea try the chorus as something like F - Bbm - B7 - C7. That's just my ear talking.

The second one isn't quite there. You've re-grouped everything correctly to conserve the durations of the bar, but you've changed the ""pulse"" into two groupings. This one is confusing because the groupings in the question do not reflect the actual pulse of the measure.  The first group of is 16th-32nd-32nd, what does this duration add up to?

At my most obnoxious ""TERMINOLOGY MUST BE CONSISTENT"" phases, I'll call V->vi and IV->I deceptive and plagal moves, reserving cadences for authentic and half cadences only. But other times, I let it slide. A deceptive cadence takes part in the cadential family by interrupting it and setting back the clock for another approach, while the Plagal cadence takes part in the cadential family by signalling a ""rounding off"" of something.

Rather, this progression is normally part of a tonic prolongation serving a variety of formal functions – not, however a cadential one. Most examples of plagal cadences given in textbooks actually represent a postcadential codetta function: that is, the IV-I progression follows an authentic cadence but does not itself create genuine cadential closure.""

musictheory,3738wa,GoatOfUnflappability,2,Mon May 25 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"Very good answer. I would only add one thing, which is perhaps a bit more subjective.   V and I share the pitch in the fifth scale position (sol) of I, at the root of the V triad. IV and I, however, share the pitch in the first scale position (do) of I, at the top of the IV triad. Sol is a very important pitch class in a given tonal piece, however in harmonic analysis it's the only pitch which isn't necessary in identification of a harmony, which tells me that of the three pitches in a triad it's generally the least important. Sharing sol, thus, might make V sound a bit farther away from I. IV, on the other hand, shares the root of the I triad, do, which can make them sound closer to one another.   Then again, I tend to hear vi6-I and iii6/4-I as being pretty nice, so it's possible I've listened to enough impressionism and post-tonal music to change my ear."

musictheory,3738wa,TheOctazone,7,Sun May 24 19:50:13 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's 4-3 and 6-5.  The 4 is a very unstable note, so it really wants to resolve to the 3.  The 6 isn't so unstable, but it's still good for it to resolve to the 5.  In minor, the 4 is a little more stable because the b3 is farther away, but the b6 is actually even less stable; it really wants to go to the 5.  By the way, the V - I cadence does not work this way.  That's the V7 - I cadence.  The V7 chord has this built-in dissonance that really guides its resolution.  The V chord, without the 7, needs to do it all by the melodic power of the 7 and the 2 to resolve to 1 and either 1 or 3, respectively.  The 5, interestingly enough, also wants to resolve to 1.  It's not generally unstable in the melody, but it is unstable as the root of the chord."

I have played guitar / piano for over a decade and have a pretty good handle of diatonic / chromatic theory, so feel free to talk in theory.

I usually attribute most of these things to clichés ingrained in our brains. We've heard IV-I so much, our brain kinda expects it.  Also, since a IV is a downwards V, IV-I can be interpreted as a I-V. It's usually found in a I-IV-I form which can be interpreted as V-I-V, giving a not-quite-resolutive sound (like a semicolon). If you listen closely, you can hear it kinda wanting to keep going (IV-I-IV-I...)  But the positioning in the composition, the expression and the overall tonal center hints it as a finishing cadence. Intuitively I understand it as a (V-I in the key of IV)-I."
musictheory,3738wa,jtn19120,2,Sun May 24 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone for your answers, as many said 4-3 is probably the main reason, and 6-5 helps to. The ii chord also has the 4 and the 6, so, with that information it would make believe that the ii-I could be as powerful as the IV-I, and we all know that it just isn't the case. Is there something to be said about the bass note going up or down a 5th or 4th? i tried the ii-I, having the ii with the 3rd on the bass, and i felt even more resoltion than with the IV-I(i might be going crazy though). Also, is there any book that you can recomend, that goes into harmony theory this deeply and explains or sugests how harmony works? Once again, thanks everyone."
musictheory,3738wa,ckaili,4,Sun May 24 14:29:48 2015 UTC,"IV to I would be F to C or FAC to CEG. F is a half step from E, C is a common tone, G is only a whole step from A. In music, ""almost I"" leads to I."
musictheory,3738wa,Bromskloss,1 point,Sun May 24 13:44:43 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone has said, usually the plagal cadence doesn't serve a cadential function in the sense of resolving the harmonic progression to the tonic. In fact, some theorist don't consider the plagal cadence a true cadence, functionally speaking. It usually comes right after a V-I arrival, so it's more like a reiteration (or prolongation) of that resolution, which is particularly fitting for an ""amen"".  In other words, it can be interpreted as an extension or decoration of the V-I that probably came before it."

musictheory,3738wa,Bromskloss,2,Sun May 24 18:44:50 2015 UTC,"I guess it really depends on the context.  Do you have a specific example?  To clarify, when I say that it usually comes right after a V-I, what I really mean is that there is something prior that strongly establishes the key.  Consider this -- a IV-I chord progression in one key could be a I-V chord progression in another key, right?  If you are listening to a piece without the sheet music, and without knowing prior what key it's in, how can you tell if a cadence you just heard was plagal or half?  The only way you'd know is if there is additional context that would imply that either the ultimate or penultimate chord were the tonic.  Usually that is with a dominant-tonic progression somewhere, which helps you situate yourself tonally.  Consider these two cadences:  Plagal (Perfect Authentic Cadence):    C:  F  - C6/4  - G7 - C - F  - C     IV - V(6/4 - 7) - I - IV - I   Half:  F:  F6 - g  - C7 - F - C     I6 - ii - V7 - I - V   Both of these progressions end with F - C.  However they serve very different purposes.  In the plagal cadence, there is a sense of arrival, but in the half cadence there is a sense of imminent continuation.  The way you can tell is that the V7 in each progression ""points"" at the tonic for you, telling you that that is the home key.  So it's sort of an issue with symantics.  Of course a piece ending in IV-I is a plagal cadence because you're already establishing that you know it's IV-I.  The question is, can a cadence ending in F - C on its own imply that you're ending on I in the same way G7 - C can?  That's where some theorists would say no.  They would say that the G7 - C in the first progression is the real tonal resolution (and therefore a perfect authentic cadence) and the F - C following just elongates the end of that cadence."

musictheory,3738wa,torchflame,2,Sun May 24 23:26:49 2015 UTC,"That's a good example!  It sounds to me that it's in the key of C up until about 4:40 (the F is natural, and it approaches a deceptive cadence to A min) and then all of a sudden it stays on G, the F# is introduced and it ends on D.   The voices all lead convincingly to D, and as an amen and the point at which the counterpoint converges, it's convincing as a cadence, definitely.  The need for a strong V-I relationship to establish a key is a particular feature of tonal music, and the evasion of strong V-I sound in this piece lends itself to a modal quality where cadential function is not as heavily reliant on harmonic configurations."
musictheory,3738wa,paranach9,1 point,Mon May 25 16:36:54 2015 UTC,"Another possible explanation is the sheet power of fifth relationships. V-I works, at least partially, because of the root descending a perfect fifth.

Also in many instruments (Piano specifically) proper voice leading shows us that F 2nd inversion is basically a C with both notes raised. It's an ascended 3rd built over a C.

musictheory,37446f,PullTheOtherOne,3,Mon May 25 01:00:44 2015 UTC,"I know it isn't jazz, Bit you might check out the Bach C major prelude from the WTC book 1. You can take out the rhythmic figuration and play block chords each measure, and then see how he connects the chords together.   I think the big thing is to just start with a right hand chord voicing that fits nicely under the hands. And then just connect to the next chord by moving each voice as little as possible. If you physically play the chords in the right hand, it'll make much more sense as you can feel the common tones and the small amount of ""nudging"" you have to do to get to the next chord.   I would almost pretend that the melody isn't even there, like you are just playing from the chords."

musictheory,37446f,Jazzerbone,5,Mon May 25 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"Stacking fourths can make easy work of this, remembering a couple things:   augmented and diminished fourths in this scenario are also fourths(aka tritones and major thirds).   Thinking intervalically, mix and match them as you would stacking thirds in tertiary harmony, but instead of two choices, major and minor, these fourths come in three varieties. The tritone usually goes on the bottom Don't even think of worrying if the root or fifth is present, let alone taking the bass note. Quartals are register sensitive.  Keep the middle voice between middle C and an octave above middle C. If you have to go higher, omit the top voice and add a root or the fifth scale degree underneath as the lowest voice. If you have to go lower, omit the bottom voice and replace with a root or fifth Use as many common tones as possible, as well as voices changing stepwise.   edit: example: starting from A just below middle C, add a second note above that one a fourth higher(D above middle C).  Next, add a third note a fourth above that one(G).  Then another a fourth higher(C an octave above middle C) and another a fourth above that(F).  ADGCF.  Make sure the G is between middle C and an octave above middle C(it is).  That voicing, precisely as spelled, works for chords designated Fma7, Bbma7, Ebma7#11, Dmi7 and G11.  This kind of all-fourths voicing can sound vague, like cardboard, by itself; but I think of them like musical tofu, they soak up the juices of the more flavorful chords that surround them.  Try a tritone on the bottom by lowering the bottom voice a half step.  Now a major third on top by lowering the highest voice a half step.   Now:  Augmented = ""+"".  Perfect = ""0"".  Diminished = ""-"".  Ready?  From the bottom!    0000  000-  +-00  +000  +00-"

musictheory,373vd0,Salemosophy,1 point,Sun May 24 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"I don't usually compose from the bass line. I typically begin with the melody, flesh out a bass line from it, and then I'll tweak the inner harmonic voices to find the sonorities I'm listening for. It just requires a bit of knowledge in counterpoint, and I can explain all the ""why it works"" stuff later, but for now, follow these general guidelines in adding voices to a melody:  1) Between the melody and bass line especially, but really in all HARMONIC voices, avoid parallel fifths and octaves between chords. This doesn't apply to melodic doubling (like reinforcing a melody in the French Horn by doubling it, at the octave, with Violins).   2) Move in contrary motion with at least one voice of the harmonic fabric. This means if all voices are descending, make sure at least one is ascending.   3) Use contrapuntal intervals. This means if your melody is moving by steps (like in a scale pattern), your bass ought to be moving by skips or by leap (like we'd see in an arpeggio pattern).   As you become more literate in terms of chords and progressions, these things may begin to feel like instinctual methods. But this is the system I use in constructing my progressions on the fly. I do have an idea of what kind of function each chord will carry with it, but I generally don't plan my stuff around a progression only. The progression usually emerges from writing with solid counterpoint and a general understanding of harmonic function and chord substitution. Just my thoughts."

You'll probably have the best time analyzing it as if it is 60s Bubblegum pop or 70s jazz/rock depending on whether or not the song is trying to be cute or dramatic.

As far as scales its easy to figure out if you play around with seventh chords.  Play a 7th chord and find all the notes that fall into it.  Compared to a basic triad you'll find you are limited when it comes to sounds that arent dissonant.  These are basically the notes you want to hover around. To create the emotion you want the bass notes and the chords are going to guide that.    Most jpop songs (especially in the chorus) follow a very similar pattern.  Take TM Revolution's Heart of Sword.  A perfect jpop case study.  Listen to guitar in the chorus after the intro.  This chord progression/movement is the core of most jpop hits and anime songs.  Using this type of progression with the 7th cords (IV7→V7→IIIm7→VIm is the quintessential stand prog for jpop) Once you've gotten this part down you need to think about the rhythm.    Unless you are doing a really slow ballad, on average jpop songs are at a much higher tempo than their western genre counterparts.  My theory about this is that contemporary western (English) language and melody is extremely rhythmic, so even at lower tempos there is a stable groove.   In Japanese language and music, it's extremely mechanical.  You can basically sing anything you play a keyboard without sounding too forced (though there are stresses on words and syllables of course). So, when you are throwing together a melody it should reflect this.  Knowing Japanese helpes a lot because you have a handle on the flow. I've said a lot and I'm not sure how much makes sense, but here is some homework. Use the IV7→V7→IIIm7→VIm chord progression for your chorus Try to make the song around or above 160 bpm Don't build groove into your melody line but father keep it spitty and mechanical.

I'm teaching myself to read and play keyboard with both hands, and currently I shy away from everything with more than a few sharps, but slowly adding more keys as time goes on. For me it's not just the playing in key but the difficulty of sight-reading that makes the other keys more difficult. Luckily there's a hell of a lot written in G."
musictheory,375fgl,tkolstee,-1,Mon May 25 01:30:00 2015 UTC,I can relate to the difficulty of sight reading. Personally I will never attempt it again; I have no interest. I just wish to be able to improvise in key so I will take your advice on board. Is there a good reference image for which notes belong to which key that is often shared around here?
musictheory,375fgl,greendolphinstreet,2,Mon May 25 01:35:18 2015 UTC,"The Circle of Fifths is an easy way to learn what key signatures contain what sharps and flats. You could memorize that diagram, but if you're like me and can't memorize something until you understand it and have all the facts you need to build it from scratch, this video might help you as much as it did me. It's long but well worth it.   Actually Pebber Brown's whole YouTube channel is a goldmine of information on music theory.  Watch the video first and you'll understand why the circle of fifths is laid out the way it is and be able to recreate it from scratch. Now you'll be able to know the ""legal"" notes in any key if you stop and think about it long enough. What you eventually want is to immediately know what notes are ""legal"" for a key, and that will take some practice.  Scales are one way, and very focused on that particular skill, but it can get boring, especially for people who are just trying to learn music for fun. Also, unless you're thinking about what you're doing instead of just playing them by rote they won't do you any good.   You can incorporate learning your keys into learning new songs to keep it fun and motivating. Start out by only playing songs in the key of C (no sharps or flats). Work your way around the sharp keys first - clockwise from the top, then the flat keys - anti clockwise from the top. Don't move on until you feel familiar with whatever key you're working on.  This works best if you're playing an instrument where there is a clear and immediate difference between the flats and sharps and the natural notes, like a piano.  If you think you might ever want to learn sight reading, you might approach this at the same time you're learning the ""legal"" notes in each key. The two things will complement each other better and give you a better understanding of the big picture and how they all interrelate.  You might have a harder time finding songs in some of the more obscure keys. Take a look at this link to see a chart of the keys by popularity in 1300 popular songs. In general the ones near the top of the circle of fifths (fewer sharps or flats) are more popular."

I feel a connection with your writing and appreciate the time you took to share your thoughts and links. This seems like the best comment in this otherwise fairly poorly received thread.

The reason why those players never hit a wrong note? They ran that major scale in a few octaves that you despise until it was perfect--often hours a day. Sound boring?

So, people can improvise because they know what well work in the given key/scale and they knew what well compliment the general feel of a piece.

Verify your work on the next run through and then adjust accordingly.   Inner voices are not often required for dictation in many programs because they usually provide support for the outer voices: they serve fill out the chords and almost anything will work as long as you don't create illegal parallels or something. So if you just connect the inner voices by smoothest voice leading, you'll end up getting about 95% of them. Then you can check the tricky parts with your ear.

Modes aren't just sets of notes: a mode is a set of notes plus a particular tonic.

Having been the kind of kid who questioned authority, I looked at dozens of pieces of music and found it wasn't true.  Years later, when I studied composition I started to understand the reasons why.  Phrases are most likely to begin on some note OTHER than the tonic.  Reason: starting every phrase on the tonic quickly becomes boring; if they start somewhere else the phrases have some initial impetus, a need to move toward the tonic.  Phrases that repeat a note many times will usually repeat some note OTHER than the tonic.  Reason: using the tonic frequently also becomes boring.  Using a different tone most often builds tension with the repetition, and the tonic will serve to release it.  Phrases end on the tonic about half the time.  Reason: phrases tend to come in pairs, with the first phrase leaving you hanging a little bit, and the second phrase providing a full resolution.  But the final phrase of a song or piece will almost always end on the tonic; the only ones that don't are using some other tone for effect."

In terms of the melodic lines - often (though not always) the melody is a fairly flowing line and the harmony line enters at a different pitch away from the main melody. It's therefore more natural to perceive the already established melody as continuing with the harmony entering around it. This could be emphasised if the backing vocals are performed by someone with a different voice or are manipulated in some other way. For example backing vocals may have a touch more reverb applied in order to make them sound more distant.   There's probably other things as well, but I think a combination of these things applied subtly makes a big difference in how the lines are perceived."

In a live concert this makes a huge difference 4) Following from 3: timbre And finally, the longer you listen to two streams, the more likely you are to hear two streams.

For example, if you're the key of C and one of the lines ends in ti-do or re-do, it'll sound more concluded whereas the other line might end on something like mi.  Also, generally speaking, the melody line will just sound more like it can stand on its own as a melody.

The group must have thought it was a mistake, because they played the first trumpet part louder than the second.  What does that tell you?  So a melody usually has longer phrasing and its notes ""make sense"" by themselves.  You can usually tell whether something is the melody by those characteristics.  For example, a melody probably won't have a cadence that goes 1 - 7 - 5 or 5 - 4 - 3, because those don't really make sense, but it may well have 3 - 2 - 1.  If you have a line with regular rhythm or that is clearly part of an accompaniment, it's probably not the melody either.  If you have two lines with different rhythms that both feel like they might be melodies -- they have long phrasing and the notes make sense on their own -- they probably are!  Sometimes one of them is the melody and the other is the countermelody, and you can tell that this is the case only by context.  If a melody plays once, then it plays again much softer while another melody comes in very loud, then that very loud melody is a countermelody, not the main one!  If two lines have the same rhythms and both might be melodies, and you can't decide whether one of them has notes that make more sense by themselves than the other, the winner is going to be the one that is more audible.  That could mean louder, or it could mean higher, or it might be from instrumentation, or something."

Glissando would be appropriate and people would know what you mean but a gliss implies you're hitting distinct pitches on your way up or down (e.g. sweeping your hand up a piano) as oppose to a portamento which signals a smooth slide (e.g. like sliding up and down a fretless bass)
musictheory,372ktx,darkmavis86,4,Sun May 24 08:37:33 2015 UTC,"Pitch bend, glissando, maybe.  Although a glissando might imply separate tones, not sure about that.    I'd go with pitch bend if its a ""smooth""  ascension between pitch X and Y."

musictheory,372ktx,TheChurchofHelix,2,Sun May 24 07:30:09 2015 UTC,"Glissando only implys separate tones on an instrument incapable of portamento. A saxophone or piano, for instance, will play a slurred diatonic or chormatic run when a gliss is notated, but a trombone or violin will smoothly move their slide/finger between the notes. Some instruments can produce smooth glissandi in odd ways, such as ""half-valving"" on a trumpet or via a tremolo bar on a guitar."
musictheory,3722l4,Bluegodinez,3,Sun May 24 03:27:40 2015 UTC,"Your question isn't really clear, so I'm making some assumptions - I'm guessing you mean a V7 chord in C?  We use Roman numerals to show the relationship of chords to the key note, the tonic of the key you're in.  V would be a chord built on the fifth note of the key's scale, so in the key of C that's G, and the V7 in C is a G chord.  If you were in the key of D, the V7 would be A7, in the key of Eb the V7 is Bb, and so on.  I'm also guessing that by ""the seventh above the dominant"" you mean the seventh note?  That would be the fourth note of the key.  If you mean the dominant chord of the dominant chord (the V/V, pronounced ""five of five"") it would be II7.  And for the last part, a key will harmonize to a given set of chords, and those chords each have names that begin with the root of that chord.  If you're in C, the notes are C, D, E, F, G, A and B; harmonized as triads they become the chords C, Dm, Em, F, G, Am and Bº.  Harmonize them using four notes (as seventh chords) and you get Cmaj7, Dm7, Em7, Fmaj7, G7, Am7 and Bm7b5.  Each of those chords has a root, the note that forms the basis for building the chord.  Most chords can be formed in more than one key: you can have a G chord in the keys of C, F or G, or a Bbmaj7 chord in the keys of Bb or F.  Does that help?"

musictheory,36v5od,QueenOfTonga,65,Fri May 22 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"One way to see it is that the time signature is a convenience, while the key signature is a necessity. You can always figure out the time signature by counting the length of the notes in each measure, but you cannot figure out the key signature if you don't know which notes are sharp or flat. It's also easier to hear what the time signature is.  Thus, a reoccurring reminder about the key is more important than reminders about the time signature. Time signatures also add more ""notational noise"" than key signatures.  That being said, the real reason is probably tradition :)"
musictheory,36v5od,PygmyTwylyte,15,Fri May 22 11:44:09 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer. Once a time signature is set up, contextual clues such as beaming and notes per measure provide all the reinforcement needed. But contextual clues aren't as obvious for key signatures. And if you see a natural it's good to have something for it to be in reference to.   Both might be included in each line, but ink and printing costs"
musictheory,36v5od,nmitchell076,1 point,Fri May 22 14:13:25 2015 UTC,For me the reverse is true. I need reminder of time signature more than key signature. Although when reading music it helps to have the key on every line; it makes it easy to see that a note needs to be altered.
musictheory,36v5od,elyisgreat,1 point,Tue May 26 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"Well time sig wont make the notes different lengths in comparison to the other notes in the song, it will change where the accent is but thats arguably not as important as hitting right notes, which will be missed without the key signature."
musictheory,36v5od,DoingItLeft,3,Fri May 22 12:55:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed, each measure has all the information necessary to extrapolate the time signature, while the same cannot be said for the key."

musictheory,36v5od,DoingItLeft,4,Fri May 22 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Good point, but I think 3/4 would be in duplets and 6/8 would be in triplets.  Anything other than that would probably be a hemiola, and intended to break the duplet or triplet feel."

musictheory,36v5od,disaster_face,3,Fri May 22 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Re: the Haydn sonata - minor key signatures didn't really become ""fixed"" until the 1800s.  As few minor key works use a natural minor scale exclusively, accidentals are going to be needed.  If you're in the key of D minor and you're using a melodic minor scale, B will sometimes be flat, ans sometimes not.  So you can either start with Bb and make it natural as needed (our modern convention - keep the same signature as the relative major) or you can start with B natural and use a flat when you want one (which was common before about 1840, and what Haydn did)."
musictheory,36v5od,tjmusic,1 point,Fri May 22 17:17:00 2015 UTC,Key signatures change way more often than time signatures. It's also important to have a baseline to look at and compare to when you're playing many accidentals.

EDIT: The worst is when the last key change was right before the last bar of a given line so if you look up for context, you can't find it and can only see the single key sig at the top of the page."

Especially significant is All The Things You Are which has a key sig. of four flats, but changes key to Cmajor in the first 8 bars, then Gmaj and Emaj in the bridge.

Is there a deeper reason for this?  For example, in the D major sonata, Hoboken XVI:14, the minuet is in D major, its trio is in d minor, but there is no key signature (and it's definitely not in Dorian mode). Similarly, there is an E flat major sonata (an early one, I don't know its Hoboken number) where the minuet is in E flat major, the trio is in c minor, but it is written with two flats only. In both cases, there are explicit key signature changes, but arguably to the wrong key."
musictheory,36v5od,Audiblade,3,Fri May 22 14:25:52 2015 UTC,"This is an example of the ""incomplete key signatures"" that appeared in some scores during the Baroque era. One reason for this was an outgrowth of the frequent raising of scale degrees 6 and 7 in the minor mode: If you're going to be raising B-flat to B-natural much of the time, why write it in the signature at all?  However, this isn't the whole story. Incomplete signatures were also a product of two other factors. For one, there was lingering modal practice among some composers in the Baroque. One way to think of this is to consider that a composition in D minor with raised scale degrees 6 and 7 (B-natural and C-sharp) reads just like D Dorian with a raised leading tone. For example, look at the final measures from Lassus's oculus non vidit. Although this piece is in D Dorian, there is a mix of B-flats (well, one) and B-naturals, as well as a mix of C-naturals and C-sharps (which make the cadence).  For another, there was a tendency from time to time to use fewer flats in key signatures, even in the major mode. For example, here's a passage from J. S. Bach's Cantata 106, which is clearly in E-flat major but has only two flats in the signature (note how Bach wrote in A-flats as accidentals). I've heard (but never read) that this is part of a larger propensity among some Baroque composers to use as few sharps or flats as possible in signatures, part of a general reluctance about going too far in the sharp or flat direction in the circle of fifths, due to pre-equal-tempered tunings that yielded ""wolf intervals,"" which ""howled"" in these more distant keys."
musictheory,36vmio,Kcori,5,Fri May 22 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at the question backwards.  Instead of asking ""what makes a contrasting section fit?"", you should be asking ""how can I make a contrasting section?""  If you look at great compositions, or even at simple pop songs, you'll find that the contrasting section ""fits"" because it sounds different... but it doesn't sound like a different tune.  So you'll want to start with what you've already got; if you start with something new you'll have a much harder time.  A few examples: in Polonaise (BWV Anh. 117b) Bach took his first measure and used it as his 9th measure (the beginning of the contrasting section), changing ONLY the melodic shape of beat 1 - beats 2 & 3, the harmony of the entire measure, and even the rhythm of beat 1 is the same as what he used in measure 1.  He then took that very slight modification and used it as a sequence; m.10 is the same as m.9, but a step lower.  And to really tie things up, mm.15-16 are identical to mm. 7-8, so both sections end the same way.    In the jazz standard ""I Love Paris"", the contrasting section starts out using the same melody as the first section - but moved up an octave, and played in the parallel major.  You get four full measures of the exact same thing, just transposed and inflected, before the B section starts doing anything else that's different.  Or take virtually anything by Taylor Swift and look at the chords she used for the verse - she typically uses four chords.  Now look at her chorus... in virtually every tune you'll see the same four chords in a different order.  Not into Taylor?  Green Day's ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" changes just one chord from the verse to get the main chorus progression.  In each of these cases (and thousands of others) it's pretty obvious that a composer doesn't say ""how do I write something different to fit with this?"" - they say ""how do I make this a little bit different?"".  Oh, and don't change too much.  As one of my composition professors told me, ""change ONE thing.  If you don't like it, change something else instead"".  (Of course, the one thing may be drastic, like using your melody in retograde inversion, but the point is: if you want it to sound like it belongs in your tune, you've got to use the same stuff you've already been using."

If in distant key, must be approached by a proper transition. Repetition helps a lot, you know, if material repeated it's a theme, if not it's an episode.  Motivic similarity and having similar chord progression helps too, I don't think this is a requirement, though."

musictheory,36x30v,SpectresDeMouse,5,Fri May 22 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it sounds bad to use notes outside the scale.  It depends on the context of the melodic phrasing.  I think of the scale more of as the map of the tonal center.  It's more like a skeleton, the backbone of a piece, but you can still play other notes, you just want to emphasize the diatonic tones a bit more (i.e. sharper attack, louder, played on the 1)"
musictheory,36x30v,apostate_of_Poincare,4,Fri May 22 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound like a cop-out, but the only rules for what sounds good and doesn't sound good are your ears - if you think it sounds good, then it sounds good, at least to you. Scales are just collections of notes - but like others point out, it's a matter of context whether or not you use a given scale or notes outside of it.   I also want to point out that it's rare to only ever use one scale for an entire piece - there are often lots of places where a piece will temporarily (or even somewhat permanently) move to other keys, and that's totally okay to do. There's also what's called modal borrowing, where you use notes from a related scale while in the key of the original one. For example, if you're working in E major generally, you can use a G natural as a borrowing from E minor, or a D natural as a borrowing from E mixolydian or E (natural) minor. This isn't really the same thing as a modulation (changing to a completely new key/scale), but it can add a little extra spice.   But all in all, this really just means that scales and keys are guidelines, not hard-and-fast rules. You can borrow whatever notes you'd like, as long as they sound good and work in terms of voice leading/harmony."

I plan to make something similar to [Plink by dinahmoe](labs.dinahmoe.com/plink/), but not exactly the same. Plink sounds like it is using the Major Pentatonic scale and everything there sounds good together, no matter what combination of notes you picked.

musictheory,36x30v,paranach9,2,Sat May 23 14:32:24 2015 UTC,"The properties of chord-scale relationship isn't reflexive like addition or multiplication.    First, the chord is built using a scale.  Next it's voiced for proper inversion, register and smooth voice leading.    The student doesn't get to see those two steps.  All you know is that there's a chord symbol on your page, but that symbol was picked out, possibly by a third party, to indicate what the author meant, not necessarily what your supposed to play.  The symbols look technical, but they're just names, designations, cartoon depictions.  The only real one-to-one relationship is what I described above.  Chords come from scales.  End of chapter.  Putting scales to chords has two approaches, traditional and jazz scale theory.   The traditional methods are robust, well documented and have many, many options to start you in at just the right level.  The topics are playing chord tones, passing tones and resolutions from one chord to the next.  Jazz scale theory works with scales as ""sheets of sound"", avoid notes, modes and ""playing outside"".   It makes it fun to jam on individual chords, but can be a bitch to get chords to flow into the next."
