We can - and ought to - develop explicit, clear, and grounded ethical systems, based on a fundamental definition of morality and ethics. Ethics I would define as a system of behaviour dedicated to ensuring the: i) life, ii) well-being, and iii) happiness of people (and I'm not excluding animals here). Then it's a science of determining how to achieve this in the greatest degree. As we've learned more about the way the world really is, through scientific advancement, we've likewise been able to make moral progress. In the West we've begun to address wealth inequality in basic ways, we've established basic rights for humans and animals, and we've worked towards making a fair world. We're making progress all of the time - just observe the equal marriage laws, which are a symbol of the latest stint of moral progress."

badphilosophy,3e11u8,slickwom-bot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:22 2015 UTC,"This type of question does not require the dramatic time scale implied in universal extinction. We all will die very soon. Is that not enough to ask the same question? Perhaps our radially nearer impending death is even more reason to ask.   My personal answer is that it is more fun to see what I can manage to become and create in my short time than it is to simply test what scale of mindless destruction I can put forth. I was reading Camus' ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" last night (thought and almost typed syphilis - why do I keep doing that???).  In light of this reading, the most fundamental philosophical question for me, which underlies all other considerations, requires an answer of either ""Yes"" or ""No"" to life. Either yes, I want to take a ride, or No I do not want to go along with this.   As our biological/psychological data is formatted in a local environment that is increasing in complexity, this makes it is vastly more fun for me to learn to be creative in ways that say yes to life while affirming my complexity (since Yes is my answer). It is a much more harrowing/fun ride. The creative and productive affirmation of our Yes in the direction of increasing complexity is the ultimate roller-coaster. If we say Yes, but are expressing that Yes in mass murder for entertainment sake, venting of anger, or the sheer lack of creativity in our Yes, then the mindless destruction of life in the context of a Yes answer is the existential equivalent of being a couch potato.  If our answer to life is No, then mass murder (and suicide) is consistent with that answer. But saying No to life does not even require that the universe ceases to exist.  Teleological accountability never enters my thinking here. I do not need to know that the universe is good or bad, has purpose or not, is eternal or temporary, or is meaningful or meaningless. It is enough for me to focus on my full participation in a journey towards increasing complexity.   This perspective is purely self-indulgent. I can hold myself to more demanding standards of morality because, in my self interested affirmation of increasing complexity (which is the joyride/horrorshow of my lifetime), I find that affirming my yes to life in more creative, complexity affirming ways is more enjoyable than allowing myself to sink into a useless sack of non-complexifying puss. I choose to learn to surf the tidal wave of increasing complexity that is passing through us. This is to catch the ultimate wave and take the ultimate thrill ride.  By the way, my one and only moral/ethical absolute is ""Thou shalt increase in complexity.""  tl;dr: Mass murder is boring. I like to play a more exciting game."

Is Occam's Razor bullshit because it reduces theoretical complexity? Are complex but inefficient/wasteful systems more desirable than simple but efficient ones? Or does it depend on their usefulness in creating/sustaining other complex systems? I get the sentiment but I'm having trouble getting a coherent picture out of it."
badphilosophy,3e11u8,Fifth_Illusion,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"You raise important questions. The short history of attempting to relate complexity to human living and ethics is full of vague generalizations that are hard to imagine how to apply. My take on clarifying the application of complexity to an ethic of human living is based on one energy dynamic that is always required for complexity to increase. This clarification results in a virtue ethic that shifts from the memorization of rules and received values to a posture of mind that can ethically think on its feet. This tends to seem like more of a Buddhist mindfulness type of posture.   In my view there is a functional cooperation between complexity and simplicity. Evenly maintained constants of complexity cannot be sustained in every aspect of a system. Reducing complexity and having spaces of incredible simplicity are both necessary for a system to have the ability to increase in complexity overall. Not all things need to be optimally complex. Occam's razor is a needed tool.  The essay I wrote, in the link below, describes in detail what I call ""complexity ethics"" through a description of the structure of human attentiveness and social relationships required relative to the energy dynamic I mentioned.  It is just my own attempt to explore this issue:  Introduction to Complexity ethics"

badphilosophy,3dtrgu,ex0du5,-5,Sun Jul 19 13:38:51 2015 UTC,"This comment of badphilosophy is bad philosophy.  It seems to know nothing of the ultrafinitist critique of meaning.  If we take a correspondence theory of truth as formalized in Tarski's model theory (and accepted elsewhere in math), then numbers only have meaning through the models built of them and available to our cognition.  But we only build finite models in reality.  So only those numbers capable of modeling are meaningful - in a very rigorous sense.  The meaning of zero, negatives, imaginary, reals, etc. are a very legitimate discussion in the philosophy of math and not deserving of scorn.  This also allows discussion of the difference between meaningfulness and usefulness."

Ultrafinitism has strong consonance with physicalist, empirical schools of meaning.  But there are also strong formalist objections to platonic beliefs, including that given by the Predicativist schools who also do not allow completed infinities."

badphilosophy,3dsgli,onetwotheepregnant,5,Sun Jul 19 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"A link from /u/reedkeeper:   An idea that would be ""dangerous if true"" is what Francis Crick referred to as ""the astonishing hypothesis""; the notion that our conscious experience and sense of self is based entirely on the activity of a hundred billion bits of jelly — the neurons that constitute the brain. We take this for granted in these enlightened times but even so it never ceases to amaze me.  Some scholars have criticized Cricks tongue-in-cheek phrase (and title of his book) on the grounds that the hypothesis he refers to is ""neither astonishing nor a hypothesis"". (Since we already know it to be true) Yet the far reaching philosophical, moral and ethical dilemmas posed by his hypothesis have not been recognized widely enough. It is in many ways the ultimate dangerous idea .  Lets put this in historical perspective.  Freud once pointed out that the history of ideas in the last few centuries has been punctuated by ""revolutions"" major upheavals of thought that have forever altered our view of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.  First there was the Copernican system dethroning the earth as the center of the cosmos.  Second was the Darwinian revolution; the idea that far from being the climax of ""intelligent design"" we are merely neotonous apes that happen to be slightly cleverer than our cousins.  Third, the Freudian view that even though you claim to be ""in charge"" of your life, your behavior is in fact governed by a cauldron of drives and motives of which you are largely unconscious.  And fourth, the discovery of DNA and the genetic code with its implication (to quote James Watson) that ""There are only molecules. Everything else is sociology"".  To this list we can now add the fifth, the ""neuroscience revolution"" and its corollary pointed out by Crick — the ""astonishing hypothesis"" — that even our loftiest thoughts and aspirations are mere byproducts of neural activity. We are nothing but a pack of neurons.  If all this seems dehumanizing, you haven't seen anything yet.   Silly me, thinking that the Mind-Body Problem was actually a problem."

I don't remember which book, but I vaguely remember reading something somewhere referring to him as the white Jesus, t'was funny.  Interesting to note, he was brought up in a strongly religious household by his father who was a protestant pastor (even went to convent and almost became a priest if my memory serves me right, I guess the commune was more fit for him), but although he became a strong atheist you can still see the influence of his studies of Christianity in his writings.  Anyway back to vegetarianism, I love me these two essays of his:  http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/elisee-reclus-the-great-kinship-of-humans-and-fauna  http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/elisee-reclus-on-vegetarianism  I really like the bit about cats retaining their libertarian spirit in contrast to those servile creatures that are dogs, jks everybody loves dogs, and I really like his recollection of his visit to the butcher as a child that made a vegetarian out of him.

Why shouldn't atheists use him as a reference against creationists?  Edit: I also find it hilarious that the upvote and downvote buttons in this thread say ""science!"" for up and ""religion!"" for down.  Such sweet irony."
badphilosophy,3dmdld,jokul,28,Fri Jul 17 13:38:15 2015 UTC,"Why shouldn't atheists use him as a reference against creationists?   I'm fine with atheists using him as reference against young earth creationists in terms of biology. However, when it comes to theology and the philosophy of religion, Dawkins is awful, and fails to even address the conception of God that is worshiped by every Christian that isn't a Southern Baptist or Pentecostal.   Going through that thread, I see things like:    Are there any even decent rebuttals against his book?  In my opinion, you can't really produce a decent rebuttal to such a quality book.  Can't refute fact and logic  The only ""rebuttals"" of it I have seen are ad-hominem attacks on his personality. The usual stuff.   etc. etc.  This incredibly problematic because it ignores the vast amount of work put into the philosophy of religion and theology. You can be an anti-theist and respect the work that people like Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, Kierkegaard, and Plantinga have put into the philosophy of religion. You can be impressed by Karl Barth's Church Dogmatics and the work he put into ensuring the Neo-Orthodoxy had a strong underpinning. You can marvel at Hans van Balthasar's work in exploring what God's mercy is. You should be impressed at the underpinnings of existentialism that Kierkegaard laid with his expositions of the teleological of the ethical and his exploration of what it means for an individual to grapple with the divine.   But this also hobbles them further when they all get in their little corner and start saying, ""Oh, no one can rebut this book!"" Really? Thomas Nagel had a pretty negative review of the book. Nagel is an atheist.  This is without us getting into his support of meme theory."

Morality don't real because cuz people think differently cuz science.  In addition, because neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and anthropology, one day we will solve morality (which don't real anyway).

I won't even consider it to be a valid option, even if i argue for the opposing option by default. Why bother? It's literally wishful thinking. Math isn't like other non-sciences in that it's actually a science and can be put under a microscope. Thus math is securely with the sciences as opposed to philosophy, and ethics is dumb unless you're talking about literally evolutionary psychology.

badphilosophy,3dj7cc,fuckmyasspissboy,34,Thu Jul 16 21:05:24 2015 UTC,"In the book they were actually estranged until they turned 13. After Hume's parents died in a freak car accident without apparent cause, Berkeley's parents (who had known about Hume since they adopted Berkeley, but hadn't told her) adopted Hume too.   The twins quickly developed an intense bond, as one might expect - but it slowly started to develop into something more fraught. Their parents started to notice a certain strained silence surrounding Berkeley and Hume as they emerged from their shared bedroom for breakfast, where initially there had been curious glances. In conversation Berkeley started to become quieter and spoke in short responses, only when spoken to, which trailed off into nothing. Hume on the other hand seemed always to have a smile with a glimmer of a smirk hovering on her face. Their parents were worried.   One night they heard cries of something like pain emerging from the bedroom of their beloved twins. They stopped quickly, and assuming a bad dream, the parents went back to bed. But when the woke up the next morning and asked Hume and Berkley about the sound, both denied any sound had been made, though the cry had been loud enough to echo around the house. Now seriously worried, H & B's parents installed a secret webcam in their children's bedroom. The next night they were again woken by cries of agony, and again their twins denied that any sound had occurred. As soon as H & B had gone to school, their parents hurried to view the footage captured by their secret webcam. Their hearts froze as the recording was revealed.   Wide-eyed and in silence, they watched a shadowy image of the terror which had been realized in their children's bedroom. Berkley lay from the moment she went to bed in an attitude of sleeping, but with her eyes blankly focused on the nothing before her. Hours passed. Hume seemed to be snoring lightly, curled up under her covers. Suddenly, at precisely the stroke of 1:01 AM, Hume's eyes flashed open. In a single, seamless movement, she left her bed and passed to Berkley's. Berkley acknowledged H's presence only by beginning a terrible trembling, and as Hume started to crawl over Berkley's blankets, she started to speak.   Whispering, she approached closer and closer to Berkley's ear, until finally her lightly moving lips were almost brushing B's earlobe . 'What's she saying'?, their mother asked at the viewing screen, half not wanting to know. Increasing the volume, their parents began to be able to pick out Hume's murmurings. ""Without... necessary.. no necessary.. without reason.. connection.. without touching.. no necessary.... connection.. no necessary connection.. no reason to believe.. no necessary connection.. no necessary connection.. no necessary connection..""  Appalled, H & B's parents looked on as Hume continued to mutter her future absent truth into Berkley's hitherto more tender ears. Berkley's eyes widened even further, her pupils rolled up into her forehead, and her back arched up and up. As soon as it was raised enough, Hume jerked down Berkley's sleep panties and stuck a finger into B's anus for a brief second, wiggled it around a bit, and yelled 'PLOOP' as she jerked it out. B shot into the air yelling, ""ALL PHENOMENA ARE GOD"" before hitting the bed and appearing to collapse into total unconsciousness. Hume sniffed her finger with satisfaction and returned to her bed. When H & B got home from school their parents spanked them both quite a little bit. It has been a couple months but that is how I remember it went."

You can easily argue that physics has all three:  Will = Intentionality. Given previous inputs, there will be a determine output that is encouraged. This is demonstrated in physics as quantum probability waves.  Morality = The subjective viewpoint on whether one particular action is favored over another. This is demonstrated in evolution and survival of the fittest. The more favored actions are those that allow organisms to reproduce the fastest/most.  Intelligence = A counter-intuitive response allowing computation to arrive at a particular answer. We can see this demonstrated in neurons and the human brain, and we've built computers which can do this as well. Actually, computation and 'intelligence' is built into mathematics/physics/etc, and can be displayed in a variety of ways.  As I said. Once you can provide a definition and argument that explicitly separates his arguments from that which just argues for physics, then I'll be willing to consider it seriously.

They never come out and say, in the future the schizos will beat the repros, but there is a certain chapter in Anti-Oedipus which ends with a suggestion that the most effective revolution may be the acceleration of capitalist deterritorializing 'meltdown' from the 'inside' - though briefly and couched in the form of a question, of course. Still, the implication is there. However, techno definitely kind of burned out/mellowed out after the year 2000, got all dubby and Kompakt (What Happened To You, Mike INK?), consequent to its decade-long 90s acceleration, so perhaps we can expect at least a few more years of repression before the schizos finally unite into their new cybernetic void swarm."

There is so much obscurantism, I as a philosophy student can't make heads or tails out of what they are saying sometimes.  I am reconfirmed in my conviction that any (left) political philosophy, to be worth writing, needs to be much more lucid than most Europeans radicals seem to be.

badphilosophy,3ddx92,giziti,24,Wed Jul 15 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"I can, if I wish, arrange to be in the company of people of my political persuasion most of the time.    Haha, yeah, what are Young Republican clubs anyway?    I can spend my entire college career taking only classes with professors who think exactly as I do.    WHERE?!?    I can take classes and earn degrees in departments that are designed to line up exactly with my worldview.    Fuck the business schools, rite?    I can be sure that an overwhelming majority of the material I am assigned to read for class will confirm what I already believe.    Dude, maybe stop taking ""Permanent Revolution in International Socialism"" over and over.    My professors will assume that I already think just like them, and use examples and anecdotes that testify to our philosophical uniformity.    My professors would blanch at the thought that they shared bleliefs with an arrogant, uninformed undergrad.    I can almost always be sure that my professor will present or corroborate my side of a debate.    Maybe it's not that you're a conservative, but that you're wrong?    I will likely never have to make the choice between writing what I believe to be true and writing what I think will get a good grade.    HAHAHAHAHA hey guys let's write about Hegel's critique of Kant in this modern philosophy class, that's gonna go over well.    If I do not get the grade I was hoping for, I can be sure it had nothing to do with the professor’s antipathy towards the political views I have expressed, or me personally.    Like the time my wife got written up for academic dishonesty because her racist-ass teacher didn't think Hispanics could write English papers?    I do not have to fear tipping my hand about my political views in my schoolwork.    If you do fear this, you must be a nazi, in which case, good?    I can pursue an English degree out of my love for literature, not put off by the lenses of critical theory that influence the way literary analysis is taught.    ""I want an English degree, but don't want to do any actual analysis of texts.""    I can speak up in class without fear of being derided for my politics.    Again, let's take Johnny Che-Shirt and drop him in Econ 101. Let's see how he fares!    I can feel confident that even if I don’t personally speak up for my side of an issue, it will likely cross my classmates’ minds.    Seriously, are you like the only guy at Wellesley or something?    I can be sure that even if people disagree with me, they will not call me evil or bigoted.    I'm beginning to think you are evil and bigoted!    I can avoid spending time with people whom I have been taught to disagree with, and who have learned to disagree with me.    Just like when you show up for church service on Sunday?    I can be sure that no one will chalk up my opinions to privilege or lack of empathy.    Yeah, dude, as a white liberal, I am given a free pass on being a white dude. Let me tell you how great it is. Any time I make a racially clueless comment, and someone gets offended, I can just say, ""hey, thanks, I voted for Clinton, Gore, and Obama, OK?""    More generally, I can express my views on controversial topics without my motives and character being questioned.    If you find this constantly happening, perhaps... your character... should be questioned?    If my ideology becomes a source of personal issues, I have ample support available at an institutional level.    Yeah, the executives who run university boards a bunch of commies, I tell ya what.    If I need a role model with whom I agree politically, I can easily find one or more.    When your role models are Hitler and Mecha-Hitler, I can see why that would be troubling.    I can freely use social media to share my politics (not that I should) and I will receive encouragement and support in ‘likes,’ ‘shares,’ and especially in comments.    Dude, you can be friends with the people on my Facebook. If I have to read another status about how Planned Parenthood sells babies to satanic cults, I will literally, yes Lana, literally, shoot someone.    I can be social and go to parties without facing mockery and looks of confusion from those who assume my lifestyle is ascetic and Puritanical.    Maybe you shouldn't be handing out Mormon pamphlets at the keg?    I can act disrespectfully toward figures of authority and remain immune from criticism.    OHOHOHOHOHOHO I did this in school! It got me a spot on an MSNBC show for all of the negative reaction that happened.    I can talk about my politically oriented extra-curricular activities without fear of judgment or derision from my peers.    Do those activities somehow include dressing up in a brown shirt and firebombing synagogues? I am thinking that perhaps you ought to face censure for that one.    I can describe my summer writing job without censoring the name of the publication or its political leanings.    ""My Time with The Daily Stormer"" was not a good article, sorry.    If I am religious, others will assume that my beliefs are a force for good and not an extension of an anachronistic and oppressive legacy of superstition.    ""Hello, my name is Mohammed, and I am a Muslim.""    I can use buzzwords and academic jargon to make my arguments, and they will be accepted as legitimate.    Kinda like this argument was not so accepted?    I can safely say that the arc of history bends in my direction and anyone who disagrees will be “on the wrong side.”    ""HITLER DID NOTHING WRONG""    I can write off opinions of those who disagree with me because of their overarching ideology.    Wow. Presented with no discernible irony, ladies and gents.    If I can categorize someone who disagrees with me as “powerful” or “oppressive,” I don’t even have to listen to them to begin with.    Jesus Christ, kid. You want to major in English, but don't get irony?    I can be confident that no one will dismiss the sources of my news and information as biased.    Yes. No one has ever called the Nation or MSNBC biased. Ever.    I can easily obtain my college’s support for explicitly political events I’d like to organize.    ""They won't let me hold a cross burning on the South Mall!""    I can get “trigger warnings” appended to texts that challenge me or make me feel uncomfortable.    Whereas conservatives are happy just to ask libraries not to stock books ""with any of that gay shit.""    I can get commencement speakers, recipients of honorary degrees, and other guests disinvited from my campus if I disagree with them.    Scott McLellan gave my commencement speech. Your argument is invalild.    I can disrupt and disrespect speakers whom I do not wish to hear; I will subsequently be praised for my denial of their freedom to speak.    Yes. That's called protesting. Everyone does it. It's an American tradition. Shut the fuck up.    I can monopolize terms like “justice” and claim that they only apply to what I am saying.    Your version of justice was ""let's gas some Jews!""    I can accuse those who disagree with me of “violence.”    Remember when you firebombed those synagogues?    I can claim that my personal experiences are “invalidated” by those who disagree with me.    Your personal experiences are the result of your butthurt confirmation bias.    If I have to follow current events for class, I can be confident that the recommended sources of news will be slanted in my direction.    ""The Jew York Times is a liberal rag!""    If I find my ideas challenged, I know I always have a “safe space” to retreat to, where people will massage my challenged beliefs and sing me a lullaby of things I’d like to hear.    Jesus Christ kid, is FreeRepublic.com no longer a place? Go back there and shut the fuck up."

""Well obviously I think human sacrifice is wrong, but since some unspecified crazy barbarians other cultures presumably think differently, I guess we have to accept."" It doesn't matter if they're saying we should accept it, the argument implies that there are people that think human sacrifice is ok and that these people couldn't possibly be persuaded otherwise! In other words, there are some inexplicably savage cultures, and we have nothing to say to each other.

You've asserted multiple times that the mind must be a product of the brain and you've stated that lower order fields are ""more explanatory"", but you've presented no evidence or reason to think they're true. This is especially problematic given that they are hugely controversial and fringe views - the mind is dependent on the brain but implying that it can be reduced to the brain is something that requires significant work to determine, and ignoring levels of analysis by asserting that a lower order explanation is a ""better explanation"" just ignores vast amounts of philosophical and scientific literature.    Edit: It's also slightly ironic that this be xposted to r/badphilosophy, given that the xposter is the one commiting the appeal to emotion and false equivalence fallacies.   There are no fallacies in his comments. Even if they were, calling ""fallacy"" is not how discussions work.

I can honestly say that I've never ever met a philosopher who cares about scientists trying to step into philosophy, nor have I even ever heard of such a person existing. Many such scientists are well-respected and applauded for their work. What I do know of, however, are philosophers who complain about scientists who try to do it without knowing anything about philosophy - kind of like if a philosopher tried to discuss science without knowing anything about science.   Sam is not a laughing stock to neuroscientists, psychology and other pseudoscience’s have that spot reserved; just the pompous philosophers who think it’s impossible to think soundly without directly referencing Aristotelian/socratic logic.   He most definitely is a laughing stock in neuroscience. His only work in the area was pretty much a terribly designed study that was a synopsis for his awful book ""The Moral Landscape"".    Regarding providing evidence, when ‘asserting’ the things I have, I've made effort where possible to at least provide a rational basis for the point, given that I do not have a lab in my home.   I really disagree that any of your major claims had a rational argument supplied to them. I feel that you thought your positions were ""obvious"" and didn't need to argue for them.    The fact that every aspect about you can be changed by changing the brain, whilst changing the liver or heart has no effect, is pretty compelling evidence that the mind is material. If that's a fringe view, I weep for humanity. The split brain phenomenon shows that the human mind can literally be cut in half; the notion of an immaterial mind is becoming less and less tenable every day. This isn't down to the opinions of philosophers or the desires of psychologists; it's a factual claim that will soon enough be tested and almost certainly vindicated by biology.   ...This is a really terrible argument. Nobody is denying that the brain is necessary for the mind, the debate is over the specific relationship between it. Even the rare substance dualists who argued that an immaterial mind could exist didn't believe that you could damage the brain without affecting the mind because to them the brain was like an antenna for the mind. So to them your argument is like saying if we damage the antenna on a radio then it affects the music coming out of the radio, therefore the antenna is the source of the music.   Of course, pretty much nobody debating this topic is a substance dualist. The debate is over whether it makes sense to say that the mind is ""material"". A lot of scientists disagree with this view and adopt something closer to property dualism, which is the idea that everything depends on one kind of substance (i.e. the material) but holds that there is still an important distinction between physical and mental properties.   Beyond that, there is disagreement that the brain is the sole cause of the mind, when you have ideas like extended cognition or the embodied mind. The position you're pushing for is identity theory, which has some significant problems posed by people like Chalmers to work out before being touted as fact.    ""There are no fallacies in his comments"", then you didn't read them. The analogy of explaining the behaviour of fleeing from a lion is absolutely a false equivalence, plain and simple right there for you to see. It is not as explanatory to say ""The man fled because a lion was in the room"" rather than, ""The man fled because the lion triggered the flight response..."" followed by explaining the neurobiological mechanisms behind the behaviour. That is most certainly fallacious, any reasonable being can see that given that the latter explains the former and if this sub thinks otherwise then it is clear your opinion is not reliable.   It's not a false equivalence, it's literally a textbook example of the issues associated with levels of analysis/explanation. The fact is that asking ""Why was the man afraid?"" requires an explanation at the level it is asked. Referring to neurobiological processes tells us nothing relevant to the question, as the explanation is that there is a lion in front of him and he's scared of lions. If we were to ask, ""What makes fear in humans possible?"" then a neurobiological explanation becomes relevant.   The problem is basically that each level of analysis has a set of phenomena that isn't available to the lower levels. If you try to answer a question of one level with an explanation from a lower level then you only get, at best, a partial answer as you will necessarily be ignoring a lot of relevant data. This is why neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers as a whole rejected the old idea that one day neuroscience might replace psychology, as it makes no sense at all to try to explain psychological phenomena at the neurobiological level.  To be clear, this isn't to say that neurobiology doesn't add to our understanding. It's absolutely necessary to understand all levels of analysis to fully explain and understand a phenomenon, but that's not the same as saying higher levels can be ignored or thinking that they are overruled by lower order explanations."

The property of emergence is certainly a confusing one, but it occurs due to real interactions between material things, and so can be fully understood by examining the material. The mind is a biological agent, it can only have been caused by biology (to me, this is indeed obvious, and I'm scared if it isn't to you). To say that the mind is caused by anything other than the brain is to invoke supernatural agents. This is not science (this was my original point on the other thread). Psychologist may not explicitly use terms like soul or god very frequently, but it's implied every time in the suggestion of an non-biological cause. It's verging on religion-level ridiculousness (as is the fervour with which you defend it).    Regarding the analogy, when you ask 'why is the man afraid?', that is not just a psychological question. The reality of why that man is afraid is a composite of imaginary psychological effects in his head and real biological events occuring in both his brain and body. To say 'he's afraid because he's scared of lions' is a useless explanation and ignores the vast majority of real, biologically detectable events occurring within. The idea that the levels of psychology and neuroscience (of which I'm not even a member, just a supporter of good scientific practice) are equal in their ability to explain behaviour is false on the basis that psychology is, by necessity, ignorant of objective reality.   Yes, my points are obvious. I've never claimed to be extraordinarily intelligent, but a rather well-reasoned individual with a disdain for wishy-washy bullshit."
badphilosophy,3dao5t,mrsamsa,2,Thu Jul 16 07:39:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason that lower levels can't explain higher ones once a full understanding is achieved.   I explained why above - different levels of analysis have access to different sets of data, relationships, phenomena, etc, that aren't accessible to other levels.    The property of emergence is certainly a confusing one, but it occurs due to real interactions between material things, and so can be fully understood by examining the material.   Materialism doesn't entail strict reductionism, and there are also really good reasons to think that it can't happen. In neuroscience we accept what is called the trivial neuron doctrine, which is the idea that the brain is necessary for psychological phenomena, but we reject the radical neuron doctrine, which is the idea that psychological phenomena can be fully reduced and explained by neuroscience.   The mind is a biological agent, it can only have been caused by biology (to me, this is indeed obvious, and I'm scared if it isn't to you). To say that the mind is caused by anything other than the brain is to invoke supernatural agents. This is not science (this was my original point on the other thread).   You're confusing a bunch of different points and that's why you're getting confused. Yes, I think for the most part everyone will accept that biology is necessary for the mind (especially when you say ""biology"" instead of ""brain"" as that includes things like the body as well). But nobody is arguing that the mind is caused by anything other than the material. It's just that this point doesn't support your claim.  There is nothing supernatural about anything I've said.   Psychologist may not explicitly use terms like soul or god very frequently, but it's implied every time in the suggestion of an non-biological cause. It's verging on religion-level ridiculousness (as is the fervour with which you defend it).   Haha, honestly this is getting more and more absurd. No, arguing that the environment forms part of our cognition is empirically demonstrable, not a faith-based claim about the soul or god.    Regarding the analogy, when you ask 'why is the man afraid?', that is not just a psychological question. The reality of why that man is afraid is a composite of imaginary psychological effects in his head   Huh? What do you mean by ""imaginary psychological effects""? Psychological effects are real... Even if you believe that they are fully reducible to lower phenomena, that doesn't mean they're ""imaginary"". The brain isn't ""imaginary"" just because chemistry explains it.   and real biological events occuring in both his brain and body.   This is true but the biological events aren't relevant to the answer.    To say 'he's afraid because he's scared of lions' is a useless explanation and ignores the vast majority of real, biologically detectable events occurring within.   The biological explanations wouldn't really tell us much. Suppose you're right and that neuroscience can replace psychology: what would this look like?  So we have a study where we want to figure out why people get scared. We stick them in an MRI, or dissect their brains, or perform EEGs, or whatever we like, and we determine that fear is caused by a specific activation of the amygdala. What does that tell us about fear? Nothing really, just that to be scared stimuli need to activate the amygdala.   That doesn't tell us what we're going to be afraid of, what environmental events will produce fear-learning, what conditioning processes will increase or decrease fear, etc etc.   The idea that the levels of psychology and neuroscience (of which I'm not even a member, just a supporter of good scientific practice) are equal in their ability to explain behaviour is false on the basis that psychology is, by necessity, ignorant of objective reality.   Don't worry, you didn't need to clarify that you had no knowledge of psychology or neuroscience, it was kind of obvious.   Yes, my points are obvious. I've never claimed to be extraordinarily intelligent, but a rather well-reasoned individual with a disdain for wishy-washy bullshit.   Except your ""well-reasoned"" positions amount to naive mistakes high school students make, which are corrected in most first year science courses."

badphilosophy,3d5596,atnorman,13,Mon Jul 13 17:47:54 2015 UTC,I'm just curious . . . what non-circular evidence do you have that you can trust your cognitive faculties to reliably produce true beliefs?
badphilosophy,3d5596,deathpigeonx,-13,Mon Jul 13 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"First of all, evidence is intrinsically non-circular.  You make a claim.  You find evidence to support that claim.  If enough evidence points towards the claim being true, whilst simultaneously little to no evidence pointing against it, then you begin to build confidence in said claim.  You'll never reach 100% confidence, by the way.  We can't even be 100% sure gravity exists.  What if all our humankind has faulty senses?  My post wasn't trying to bash religious folk.  My post was intended to show that even the most mundane and seemingly insignificant decisions in your life are performed with the pretense that you have evidence for some sort of outcome.  Everything in life is a gamble."

badphilosophy,3d5596,revlisaerok,-6,Mon Jul 13 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"No.  What's happening here is that the accepted consensus is that evidence works.  By stating that evidence may not work, you are the one making the claim here.  The burden of proof falls on the one making the claim so it is your responsibility to find evidence that evidence doesn't work.  Therefore, it is you, not me, who must provide evidence that evidence doesn't work without using evidence."
badphilosophy,3d5596,I_cut_my_own_jib,13,Mon Jul 13 22:46:05 2015 UTC,"No, you are the one making the claim. The claim is that evidence works.  The accepted consensus is that evidence works, but that consensus is based on faith.  I'm not going to make arguments that evidence doesn't work, because I believe it does, but that belief is based in faith."
badphilosophy,3d5596,revlisaerok,-8,Mon Jul 13 22:59:26 2015 UTC,"I don't even know how to begin addressing your point.  Look, I'm not an asshole so I'll try my best to handle this without becoming one.     No, you are the one making the claim. The claim is that evidence works.   In order to make a claim of something you want to test, it has to be something that either most people don't accept or most people do not know.  I wouldn't make a claim that gravity is what causes objects to move towards each other because everyone and their grandmother know about the law of gravity.  So if you honestly think that asserting that ""evidence is a good method for supporting a claim"" is in itself a hypothesis, I have nothing more to say to you because you have removed yourself from rational discussion.    That being said, and assuming you are just saying things you don't really mean because you're getting a bit upset, I'll move along to the next point.   The accepted consensus is that evidence works, but that consensus is based on faith.   No, it is not.  For thousands and thousands of years, evidence has been the primary (read: sole) source of discovery.  If I were to tell you that I can turn water into wine, you wouldn't say ""well, since we can't use evidence here (as it's clearly based on faith), I guess I'll have to accept the fact that you can really turn water into wine.""  You'd say ""Bullshit! Prove it to me"".  Demanding that evidence is not ""faith based"", it is just what the human brain does.     I'm not going to make arguments that evidence doesn't work, because I believe it does, but that belief is based in faith.   Right here.  This is where the big problem is.  You physically cannot refute that evidence is the driving source of discovery because the very nature of tackling that problem would require some sort of evidence.  Even if that evidence was Jesus floating down from the sky and saying ""There are many ways to find truth"" in and of itself would be EVIDENCE.  This will be my last comment to you as I have not much left to say.  Like I said, I'm 99% sure you're not saying things you really mean and your jimmies are a bit rustled, which is fine.  I was quite upset too when I first heard George Carlin rant on religion or Neil Degrasse Tyson or Carl Sagan demand evidence for the existence of a God.  It calls into question many deep parts of your life, which is hard.    But that doesn't give you the ability to suddenly claim that evidence (and therefore, science, since science is 100% based on evidence) are faith based.  Do we know that evidence works for sure? No. Can we ever know for sure? No.  Does that mean we have some faith that it works? No.  It means that until evidence emerges to suggest that evidence does NOT work, the correct decision is to continue believing (based on the evidence i previously mentioned) that it does in fact work.  And, if that evidence were to emerge, it would be paradoxical because we would have just used evidence to disprove evidence.  This is the cyclic nature of the argument.  Have a nice day."
badphilosophy,3d5596,simism66,16,Mon Jul 13 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"In order to make a claim of something you want to test, it has to be something that either most people don't accept or most people do not know.   While I'd normally be willing to skip these basic steps in a debate, this is a debate about the very basis for acquiring knowledge and viewing the world. So maybe just humor me, but I'd like to talk about the very basics. How about we follow the points?  1 - The OP says that you do not need any faith, whatsoever. Rather, the OP says we can live by evidence alone.  2 - In order to prove this, we need to prove that evidence is a valid way of viewing the world. This is where you're getting tripped up. The /r/atheism community and many others on reddit are so caught up in the evidence based paradigm that they don't even think to question the very basics of it.  3 - Since using evidence to prove that evidence works would be circular logic, there cannot be an evidence-based basis for using evidence as the only way to view the world.   For thousands and thousands of years, evidence has been the primary (read: sole) source of discovery. If I were to tell you that I can turn water into wine, you wouldn't say ""well, since we can't use evidence here (as it's clearly based on faith), I guess I'll have to accept the fact that you can really turn water into wine."" You'd say ""Bullshit! Prove it to me"". Demanding that evidence is not ""faith based"", it is just what the human brain does.   Actually, no, I think evidence is the best way to look at the world, and I would certainly want to see evidence of something in order to believe it.   However, my point is that evidence cannot be used as proof of the soundness of evidence. We are all, essentially making the faith-based conclusion that ""If there is a weight of evidence for a position, that position is likely correct"".   You physically cannot refute that evidence is the driving source of discovery because the very nature of tackling that problem would require some sort of evidence.    You're very close to getting it here. I agree that you can't prove or refute that evidence is the base of discovery (not the term I'd like to use, but we'll go with it). Therefore, your choice whether to accept evidence or not must be non-evidence based, i.e., faith based.   I'm 99% sure you're not saying things you really mean   Sort of. Yes, I do really mean that accepting the concept of evidence is faith based. No, that does not mean I don't accept evidence. I just acknowledge that I am accepting the concept of evidence on faith.    I was quite upset too when I first heard George Carlin rant on religion or Neil Degrasse Tyson or Carl Sagan demand evidence for the existence of a God. It calls into question many deep parts of your life, which is hard.   Would it surprise you to learn that I myself am an Atheist, and have been for many years? In fact, I can't remember ever believing in any sort of religion. My parents are different religions, and decided to just not teach me or my siblings any sort of religion. But, my Atheism is based on faith. I can't prove there are no gods or supernatural beings, I just believe that.   Do we know that evidence works for sure? No. Can we ever know for sure? No. Does that mean we have some faith that it works? No.   This is self contradictory. You openly admit that you don't know, and yet you believe. That is faith.    until evidence emerges to suggest that evidence does NOT work, the correct decision is to continue believing (based on the evidence i previously mentioned) that it does in fact work.   I agree that using evidence is the best way to view the world.  I'm not actually sure that evidence could ever disprove the use of evidence, though. Wouldn't it then be disproving itself, thereby meaning there is no evidence against evidence? Which would then make the original evidence valid again, thereby making it disprove itself. Sort of a chicken-and-egg thing."

He says, I know it's unlikely, but wouldn't it be wonderful if it were true?

And if we're going to draw lines into what's philosophy and what's not, I'd rather err on the side of openness rather than closure.  Let me clarify once more though. I agree that Rand sucks balls. I agree that for someone with a sophisticated enough level of philosophical thinking, her philosophy is laughable. But for a more or less supposedly open forum, I think her philosophy should be open for discussion. I also think eliminativist theories of mind are laughable, but I wouldn't want to close discussion around that.

badphilosophy,3d2cu3,yibanghwa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"This depends of how pointing out the fallacy is used in the context of an overall discussion/argument.    If one points out an opponent's fallacy in an attempt to demonstrate that the opponent's conclusion is false, that is clearly bullshit.   If, however, one points out the fallacy merely to point out that one's opponent has failed to establish his or her conclusion, that is perfectly acceptable.  In fact, it identifies a line of reasoning that is a dead end, which, if the people debating/arguing wish to get to the truth, is very helpful.  TL; DR:  Identifying fallacies does not establish conclusions.  It invalidates arguments, and indicates that more needs to be done to get to the right answer."

But, probably more often, people there point out fallacies simply to identify bad arguments.  This can get obscured by the tone of discourse sometimes (often?), but many there understand the difference and proceed correctly.  Indeed, most there do not believe that the nonexistence of God can be proven, and therefore do not believe that pointing out fallacies in theistic arguments can do anything but undermine the validity of those arguments.  Much of the frustration on /r/atheism stems from encountering the same shifty arguments for the existence of God over and over again, presented by people who think they are saying something brilliant or profound.

(Can I say that it's a Christian thing to care about what he learns here, and want him to grow* from it?  Or is that supposed to be a secular thing, on the whole?)

Whenever a field is just starting out and is getting its sea-legs, there's almost always a massive debate over some set of philosophical issues which are central to the field. For example.

In terms of papers, here's a list of papers I've read on the subject so far (the number of citations is given in parentheses as a first-order indication of a paper's impact). I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, so I don't claim that these are a representative sampling of work in the field (nor that I understand all of them), but they should be a good place to start.  I wish I could link to published debates between scientists, but these discussions mainly seem to happen in person. Obviously, the positions that working scientists hold aren't as sophisticated as those of the philosophers who focus on these topics, but they aren't that far behind.

They reified the concept of time to a real being (it's a concealed aether which is real and existing to make the equations work in some areas but not others - micro and macro scale escapes the theory) and get away with continually for 100 years plus because muh mathematics. Well, mathematics is derived from reality (not will to power, sorry ice , you're mistaken), and they have some sneacky concepts there too, like infinity and dividing by zero to get there.

The Ethics was published post-humously, in Amsterdam, by supporters; he had no need to appease the Jewish community, from which he was irrevocably ostracized as a young man; and the theology of the Ethics is clearly prefigured in earlier and more private writings like the Short Treatise and Principles of Cartesian Philosophy--so I'm not seeing any good reason to take this theology as an artifact of the text being written in code or altered to appease the censor.  And so much of what he says about God is theology found pervasively in medieval and rationalist metaphysics, and moreover said there for the same reasons he gives for saying it, and moreover these sources are where he presumably learnt these ideas from.  So there really isn't much internal evidence for the view that he's using these words in a very idiosyncratic way anyway.  What is radical about Spinoza is the priority he gives to God's sovereignty.  His necessitarianism has ironic origins in his argument that since God is absolutely infinite, there is nothing that could--under pain of contradiction--limit his power; so that, accordingly, all that God can conceive must--under pain of contradiction--be made actual through his power.  This is legitimately radical on theological grounds, and it's understandable why it troubled the orthodox.  Though, even so, it's not coming out of nowhere--as if the idea that there's a theologically radical doctrine here is merely a mistaken artifact of Spinoza not even talking about theology except merely accidentally, by using theological language as a code.  Rather, exactly this debate about how to reconcile a natural theology of providence with God's sovereignty, and exactly this tactic of privileging God's sovereignty, are characteristic developments of Reformation theology and its fall-out in the early modern period, which are debates Spinoza would have been well aware of through his association with the Collegiants.  It seems to me that there's a kind of irony here, where if we endorse an occult interpretation of Spinoza that would make him an atheist, he looks less radical than if we take him at his word.  At face, he uses the very premises of contemporary theological debates to turn providential theism on its head, and show that any consistent application of the principles even the theist agrees to gets us to an impersonal God and something like naturalism.  On the occult interpretation, his relationship to traditional theology is merely that he's changing the subject.  Which of these results is more provocative?"

badphilosophy,3cgzbl,wokeupabug,2,Wed Jul 8 04:24:10 2015 UTC,"He had to write the TTP with a fake publisher, anonymously, using Latin to avoid censorship, in order to test the waters for the Ethics. Friends were seriously worried that he was going to be killed by a mob of Orangists. He was trying to get the Ethics published for years before he died. The political reality of the time was definitely a factor in his writing.  On that note, I don't follow that knowledge and use of theological rationalism is an endorsement of their original ends, but writing to an intended audience. Compare his letters to Oldenburg with some of his one-off letters. There's a guy that wrote, asking about ghosts, that Spinoza essentially told to fuck off. Spinoza was writing to people that already were at least academically on board with an impersonal God, and if you didn't do your homework, he wasn't going to waste his time.  Basically, it's a question of if Spinoza's God means anything once he gets done with it. It's beyond impersonal, it's completely stripped down of anything resembling agency or will. We get to talk about infinite intellect, but that's really closer to an infinite library than any sort of way we'd use the term. We get finite modes like Legos to build stuff on the table, and we get excited when we hear that there are infinity Legos in the tub next to us, but we have to use them in a certain causal order predicated by the last Lego we pulled out of the tub.  Seems to me that he's either heading towards a version of materialist atheism (which was, let's face it, what the version of pantheism that wishy-washy people assign to Spinoza always was) or he's setting up a heel-face turn to be a weird crypto-Calvinist by jimmying the back door open. God picking out and handing me the next Lego is one thing, I might be a little let down about the free will thing, but whatever. Even God paying attention to his phone and not really noticing what Lego he gives me is fine. Maybe it hurts my feelings a bit, but fine, I get it. Knowing that there's a causal chain of Legos that I'm going to reach in and pick out myself deterministically gives sovereignty to, I don't know, the tub of Legos, or my brain chemistry, or the finite mode that I call a Lego, or the infinite attribute that manifests itself in a certain way that keeps Legos from exploding into constituent baryons. I can call all this God, if I want, but I can also call it Nature without losing any granular specificity. Lifting the term Nature to take the baggage of the term God is a mistake, though."
badphilosophy,3cgzbl,Jaeil,3,Wed Jul 8 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"The political reality of the time was definitely a factor in his writing.   But not a factor which gives us a plausible reason to think that the theology of the ethics was a code or deference to the censor, since the publication was done by a small group of friend post-humously, and the content of the theology is found in earlier and more private writings.   Basically, it's a question of if Spinoza's God means anything once he gets done with it.   And plainly it does--it plays a central and pervasive role in his metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, and, notably, a role comparable to the role God traditionally played in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics.   It's beyond impersonal, it's completely stripped down of anything resembling agency or will.   In the sense that when God is conceived as absolutely sovereign, his will is seen as absolute rather than selective, which is a dilemma prominent in theology since late scholasticism and perhaps the most prominent theological issue of Reformation theology.   We get to talk about infinite intellect, but that's really closer to an infinite library than any sort of way we'd use the term.   Maybe ""than any sort of way we'd use the term"", but not in any sort of way than Augustine, Aquinas, or Malebranche would use the term--and it's the latter that is the more significant comparison.   Seems to me that he's either heading towards a version of materialist atheism...   Surely he's not a materialist, since surely the materialist could not abide an intellect not realized in matter and causally autonomous of matter, let alone the infinite other attributes beyond extension which are not realized in matter and causally autonomous of matter, and presumably could not abide God's activity as natura naturans but rather thinks of nature wholly as natura naturata, and may well have some concerns about the infinite modes even in the case of the attribute of extension and certainly in the case of every other attribute.  And surely he's not an atheist, since the atheist cannot abide his commitment to the existence of God--you object, of course, that this word is being used by him in an idiosyncratic way, but it seems to me that we get the same result when we swap out the name for a description of the concept it describes: surely the atheist cannot abide his commitment to the existence of a substance infinite in its kind and absolutely infinite, self-caused or whose essence contains existence, in and through which all else is conceived, identifiable primarily as the creative act of natura naturans, whose essence may be conceived an infinite number of ways indeed an infinite number of ways human intellects cannot fathom, and so forth...  Perhaps we could situate him in a Whiggish history of ideas leading up to materialism and atheism.  I don't have any objection to his important for the history of naturalism, and indeed argue for this importance."

badphilosophy,3cckma,MyShitsFuckedDown2,6,Mon Jul 6 23:24:42 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I'm not sure why you'd use that language then. When you're in a store or online thinking about, for example, buying an iPhone or a PlayStation 4, does the employment of people at FoxConn factor into your purchasing decision at all? Like, ""hmm... If I buy this thing it will help FoxConn provide better suicide nets around its facilities to ensure that less workers kill themselves?"" Or ""If I buy this thing they'll be able to hire more workers who'll then be driven suicidal due to exploitative and inhumane working conditions. Which is a net benefit for the 'global poor'"". Or do you just kind of think about how much you want that thing vs how much money is in your account and that's the end of it?"
badphilosophy,3cckma,MyShitsFuckedDown2,2,Mon Jul 6 23:30:00 2015 UTC,I believe that sweatshops do more good than harm so   Why?   The cheap option and the ethical option are usually the same option for me when it comes to manufactured goods.

badphilosophy,3cckma,FouRPlaY,0,Mon Jul 6 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for smokeweed-everyday, but I actually have thought about this.  The fact is, every economic exchange involves tradeoffs.  There's no one perfect solution to things.  But if I stick with something that, overall, is a benefit, I can justify that ethically to myself.  Yes, the state of the international labor market is far from ideal.  And not every company has suicide nets, but with globalization it's certain that at least one does, and enough purchases ensure I will in some way contribute to that company's bottom line.  And yet, what happens when the sweatshops leave?  This isn't a hypothetical question.  Economists studied the effects of a sweatshop closing, and found that the children that worked there turned to more dangerous, more exploitative work.  I agree that sweatshops are bad, but surely we can agree that prostitution is worse?  Sure, in an ideal world, every item I buy would be traced back to happy workers living in a Nordic-style worker's paradise.  But that isn't an interesting question.  A better one is: how do I do my best living imperfectly in an imperfect world.  It turns out that buying cheap electronics is okay."

badphilosophy,3cakqj,shannondoah,4,Mon Jul 6 12:41:53 2015 UTC,"Haha, I love that someone tried to calmly re-explain the problem afterwards. Also, obviously dualism entails that the souls is information that can be uploaded to a computer...  Also, are Catholics really not dualists? Is God made of material? Or are we talking idealism?"
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Menexenus,8,Mon Jul 6 15:49:12 2015 UTC,"This guy's just really confused. There are a number of religions like Gnosticism that are called ""dualist"" that they don't like, but it's a completely different thing and I think that's what he's trying to complain about."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,bunker_man,2,Mon Jul 6 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"Well, they are but historically they believed that the soul was necessarily tied to the body, and it would be nonsensical to believe that a soul could live separate. So some of them call ""dualism"" the idea that people just are a soul that can leave the body and chill ""elsewhere."""
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Avent,3,Tue Jul 7 09:10:53 2015 UTC,"This guy is probably wrong about what Descartes said or thought, but the basic premise (mind-body dualism is incompatible with Catholic theology) is pretty correct.   Speaking just from a theological standpoint, the Catholic Church heavily emphasizes the bodily resurrection, that our souls are connected to our bodies and that our entire selves, body and soul combined, will join God in the resurrection.   Mind-body or soul-body dualism also has problematic implications for Christ's sacrifice and divinity. To suggest that his divinity was somehow distinct from his physical form would trivialize his suffering and sacrifice. The fully human and fully divine nature of Christ is thoroughly emphasized in the gospels, and was a major sticking point in the early Christian Church's distinction of heresy and (small ""o"") orthodoxy.  Again, not commenting on Descartes's philosophy at all, just trying to shed light on what I think the linked OP is trying to convey theologically..."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Fifth_Illusion,2,Tue Jul 7 08:42:31 2015 UTC,"Is this really bad philosophy? It seems to me like all they're arguing is that Cartesianism is incompatible with ""true"" Catholicism, whatever that is supposed to be, but that's a theological question innit?"
badphilosophy,3cakqj,SCHROEDINGERS_UTERUS,9,Mon Jul 6 17:20:26 2015 UTC,"They're trying to complain about Gnostic-style dualism, which is basically ""spirits are good, matter is evil."" Completely different from Descartes' dualism with respect to mind and body."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,SCHROEDINGERS_UTERUS,2,Mon Jul 6 18:04:23 2015 UTC,"Eh, that might indeed be the extreme of that line of thinking, but you don't have to go that far for it to veer into error. It essentially becomes problematic as soon as you start treating the soul/mind as something which can be identified wholly with the person, or which is a complete person on its own separate of a body."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Fifth_Illusion,2,Tue Jul 7 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"Right, but thinking that the soul is a separate substance that can exist without the body, even if it doesn't constitute a whole person, is not only compatible with but required by Catholic theology since the soul lives on after death."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Avent,2,Tue Jul 7 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"Sure, but even then, that's a temporary situation, not strictly speaking a soul wholly without a body. The body itself will be resurrected. Note here that we aren't speaking of creating a new body for the soul, but reconnecting the old one with the body."
badphilosophy,3cakqj,Fifth_Illusion,2,Tue Jul 7 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, also on re-examination that whole ""upload mind to computer"" bit is a pretty awful strawman for Cartesian dualism. I'm pretty clueless about Gnosticism, do you have any recommended reads?"

The post lacks sophistication on that point.  Although it does seem like it is a bit /r/badphilosophyofscience at least insofar as evolutionary psychology - an empirical field making empirical predictions - is compared to theology with the intent to reject falsification as a demarcation criterion.  Put another way, if you're really charitable, it might not be bad philosophy. But if we were that charitable, we'd be out of a job."
badphilosophy,3ca0qw,Naejard,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"My big problem with anthropology is that it has become deeply political. In the same way a racist might seek to prove a racial hierarchy of intelligence to justify his beliefs, so too is the belief in a blank slate unquestioned (or rarely questioned) in CA because it means that humans can be culturally molded to do or believe in anything, which justifies the (frequently radical left wing) movements of social transformation many anthropologists believe in.   In other words, mainstream social science = classical Skinnerian behaviorism = HITLERMAOSTALIN TEKKIN ERR FREEDOM!!!!! Of course, this is a fairly straight regurgitation of Chomsky's own views on science and human nature, especially as espoused by noted popularizer of Chomskian linguistics Steven Pinker, so yeah it's sort of low-hanging fruit; swallowing badphil published with a PhD in the byline is a lesser offense than being the PhD in the byline."

Most people consider lying to be an example of a value of [x] in this case: it's wrong to lie, but at the same time, it's not usually an outrage to lie.  Thus, people don't typically get up in arms about lies, and rarely do people talk about punishing liars more than a simple lecture at most.  Outside of non-consenting sex and sexual infidelity, I tend to see other forms of sexual immorality (including sex outside marriage and some sex acts regardless of the marital status of the participants) as morally wrong, but not outrageous.  It happens.  It's just a normal part of human existence, and I'm quite willing to accept that there are plenty of people out there that disagree with me on whether those acts are immoral or not.

As a matter of fact, I'm not entirely sure that what's happened to Kardashian is objectionable objectification.   We inevitably reduce public figures, in our minds, to some small set of characteristics. Few people value Barack Obama as a person, but I think it would be ridiculous of him to complain about being objectified because most people only care about his politics. It would be similarly absurd for Adele to present a perspective on the harms of being objectified for her voice.   Women are disproportionately sexually objectified, and this is a problem, but I think that those who willingly pursue that objectification are not the people who should be speaking about that problem.

It is a pointless thing to say in most cases, but it can be useful to remember where the burden of proof belongs to and to point out that atheism is in fact the default position, so to move out of it something must convince a person.  Also, just for clarification, default position does not mean better or more rational, after all, not believing in the moon landing is the default position too, since you first need to learn what the heck moon, astronaut and space means before you can believe in it."

I didn't manage to find it on that sub, but googling everything that I found turns out to be more about a debate about the limits of the term atheist then anything else. Just like I thought it would be, so that is why I was pointing, that if, by atheist one meas just someone who does not believe (a definition that can be argued against as being too broad), it would be correct.  Just felt like commenting it because I think that when using text communication, people often misunderstand each other over different definitions of a term. Since in a real-time conversation one would interrupt the other to ask ""what do you mean by X"" and avoid issues likes these of shoe atheism."
badphilosophy,3c5qgb,Koyal_Alkor,3,Sun Jul 5 05:40:00 2015 UTC,"Right. I think the shoe atheism issue is not all that relevant.

You find out a lot about things long before you're given a straight definition, and still fully understand what you're talking about. When you were six, you probably fully understood what was meant when your parents talked about their love for you. If you have relationship problems later in life, you're not free to say ""one first needs to learn what love is to convey it"" unless you're in the habit believing someone, anyone that falls for Appeals to Innocence exclusively.

That is why in my first post I say    If by natural atheist one means, not a believer   That was my whole point, they are correct IF they make it clear they are using this broad definition of atheism.  Words are stretchy like that in everyday language too, it would be impossible to communicate if we had to learn 500+ different terms to account for each slight variation in political position, people just need to make sure they are on the same page. But asynchronous communication like texts or recorded youtube videos make it easy for two people in a discussion to build upon two different definitions of a term and never be able to understand each other.  One can argue if that is too broad of a definition, like wokeupabug does and seems to to it well (not going to pretend I read it all, but I might still)."

badphilosophy,3bxrrm,Tiako,2,Fri Jul 3 03:50:10 2015 UTC,"Eta: so, everyone realizes now that the chimpire has basically taken over Reddit, right?   ?"
badphilosophy,3bxrrm,ucantharmagoodwoman,6,Fri Jul 3 03:59:43 2015 UTC,"Quick summary;  The ""chimpire"" refers to a bunch of racist subs run by white supremacists. About 6 or so months ago, some ""internal memo"" or something from people on that disgusting neo-nazi website stormfront got leaked to the public or whatever. It contains a reference to Reddit as being ""The perfect recruiting grounds"", and delineates protocall for recruiting techniques and catch-phrases to use as propoganda.   Whatever, stupid, boring, etc.   Except, oh wait, they do it and it totally fucking works.   I start noticing that the phrases they mentioned are all over the comments in every top level post on almost every default sub (this does not include /r/philosophy, much to the mods' credit. Good job, guys. I'm proud of philosophers.) Anyway, it starts getting more and more over the top. (If you want examples, I'll link but this shit is starting to cut into my drinking time. quick example: I've personally received death threats on one of my other accounts that I use when I engage with the stupid effing stormfronters.)  The admins don't do shit about any of it. I wasn't aware of all their other abject displays of incompetence, buy I'm not surprised to hear about it.  Anyway, the coup de gras for the white supremacy crap was the Jesse Jackson AMA last night. It had a karma count of 14 when I saw it at midnight, and the comments where a mix of about 80% ""hurrdurr the black comminity savavages eurasia evolution"" bs and 20% ""holy shit white supremacists have taken over Reddit.""   Now, I don't know much about Jesse Jackson, but I will say that I've heard the man is litigious. So, I'm guessing Victoria's being fired has something to do with the fact that that AMA was just literally a hate-speech filled shit show and the subsequent response by Jesse Jackson's legal counsel.   As for all the other stuff about outdated modtools and so on, like I said, I'm not surprised and I don't blame these volunteers for not wanting to continue to make profit for a company that won't even respond to emails.   But that aside, I bet dollars to donuts that Victoria was fired because Jackson is (rightfully) pissed and is getting ready to sue the eff out of reddit.   And none of it would have happened if the chimpire hadn't come to town."
badphilosophy,3bxrrm,Tiako,5,Fri Jul 3 04:42:11 2015 UTC,"Is there any actual reason to believe Jesse Jackson has anything to do with this? Like, an actual reason beyond a vague fear of sue happy black men?"
badphilosophy,3bxrrm,ucantharmagoodwoman,2,Fri Jul 3 07:29:47 2015 UTC,"No, there isn't, really. I mean, he is known for suing, but that's within his rights. Maybe he's simply mastered a very effective tool.   I guess the reason I'm disposed toward thinking this is that the only thing that seems to move the company that owns Reddit is the possibility of litigation.  Ps:. Btw, if I were him, I'd sue the shit out of them, too."
badphilosophy,3bxrrm,Tiako,6,Fri Jul 3 07:34:44 2015 UTC,"Why? He has literally zero ground to sue Reddit. Zilch, nada. What legal case could be even vaguely think of bringing up?  No, this appears to be a desire to blame the scary black man."

J. moment  Double Edit: it's actually worth highlighting the part that I mean:  AMY GOODMAN: President Bush speaking at the UNITY Conference this past Friday. Afterwards, the Reverend Jesse Jackson held a news conference and he was questioned by Brent Merrill of the publication, Smoke Signals.  BRENT MERRILL: As you saw today at the president’s conference, the leader of the free world does not understand tribal sovereignty. What would you do in your estimation, Reverend, what would you do and how would you advise tribes to educate our folks, just exactly what tribal sovereignty is?  JESSE JACKSON: The President explained. You just didn’t understand. Sovereignty is sovereignty. You understand? It’s like in sovereignity. If you are on a reservation, you have been soverized. Your Ph.D. is in soverbication. You understand? I don’t think you understand.  BRENT MERRILL: You’re right. I didn’t understand that.  JESSE JACKSON: Well, needless to say — needless to say that the sovereignty of American — Native American tribes are federally protected rights. As long as Native Americans were perishing on those reservations it didn’t matter to states. But now that you have gaming on the reservations and economic development on the reservations, and indeed in some states voting on the reservations, the state now wants to impose itself on the federally protected sovereignty of the states. It has nothing to do with education, per se. It has to do with a legal relationship between federally constructed contracts or treaties, and states would not have the right to interfere with those federal territories.

It's a fucking horrorshow:   [Textbook #26] asks: ‘But why can’t the procedures of the scientist be applied to social, political, ethical, and economic problems? Why do scientists disagree over environmental, social, and political issues?’ The answer is: ‘Often the disagreement results from the inability to control variables ’(p.6). Accompanying this statement is a very curious graph, mapping ‘numbers of variables’ (measured in powers of ten) onto ‘disciplines’, running as follows: math, physics, chemistry, earth science, biology, social sciences (p. 7). At the math end of this range, we have fewer than ten variables, while in the social sciences, we have 108 + variables. This in an interesting approach to the too- many-variables problem...          [T53:] ""To suggest that John Hinckley shot President Reagan because he was under orders from the Devil is not testable because it invokes a principle (the Devil) that is not in the province of science. Such hypotheses might be of value to philosophers or theologians but not to the scientist.          Not a single text mentioned either the discovery/justification distinction or the problem of a logic of discovery          T65 observed that ‘philosophers of science debate the relative merits of these approaches [deductive and inductive reasoning], but in reality they are well-integrated parts of the scientific process’"

The law for the development of the self in respect of understanding, so long as it remains true that the self is becoming itself, is that every increase in understanding corresponds to a greater degree of self-understanding, that the more it knows, the more it knows itself. When this does not happen, the more understanding increases, the more it becomes a kind of inhuman knowledge in the product of which man's self is squandered, much as men were squandered in the building of the pyramids, or as men were squandered in Russian brass bands on playing just one note, neither more nor less"" - (Kierkegaard 61).   I think that once technology has moved to the point of making questions irrelevant, there will be a sort of... paradoxical sense of progress... one where we sit around in a new Dark Age circle jerk and think up new problems.   ""If the nation consisted only in past and present, no one would be concerned with defending it against an attack. Those who maintain the contrary are either hypocrites or lunatics. But what happens is that the national past projects its attractions --- real or imaginary --- into the future. A future in which our nation continues to exist seems desirable. That is why we mobilise in its defense, not on account of blood or language or common past. In defending the nation we are defending our to-morrows, not our yesterdays"" (Ortega 173).

badphilosophy,3bnykt,herbw,0,Thu Jul 2 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"Actually, ""nobody who has anything to do with cognitive..."" isn't logicallly, necessarily true, at all. The DSM5 is mostly for treating psychiatrists and some psychologists who do use it. It's quite possible there are many 1000's of psychologists and those in the clinical neurosciences who didn't think much of what you describe as a ""stuff storm"". & others & for many other reasons, who so missed it. Not being in the neurosciences yourself, and making such a comment, also indicates exactly why & another instance of what have been discussing.  The philos and their ilk really do NOT know very much about what they talk of when it comes to the sciences. Again, your terse post simply proved that point once again. Plus the fact that it's not logically necessary that someone missed the controversy, either. I'm sure many didn't consider it a controversy, but more ""stuff"" as usual, and simply went about their businesses. As most of us did, who ACTUALLY have the training and experience enough to work in the field. Which very clearly YOU do not!!  We have a saying in the field. If we detect way too many rationalizations, false claims and bad logic for a belief, then that belief is likely not the case and rests more upon emotional drives than reason and the facts. This necessarily applies to your off the cuff post. Unless you'd like to retract?  It also applied to a great many of those arguments made by those who objected to what Hawking wrote.  QED.  You may place yourself thus, mostly logically, within the BadPhilo examples with a foil hat on your head!! & the other oxymoronic, those ""logicians"", with hybris. If your post is logical, take a refresher course!!  A double gottcha! is a good way of pointing out your foibles, sir.

While an anti-homosexual subtext may not have been what he intended, I now understand why most Catholics tend to be vehemently anti-homosexual: their commitment (or their leader's commitments) to final causation and substance/essence (I'm still a little murky on the difference TBH) dictates that they see gay/transgendered people as not being what they're supposed/meant to be. A man is supposed to be a particular way, a penis is supposed to be used for a particular thing, etc, all because these things have final causes.  My question is: if someone argues from this Thomistic/Aristotelian framework, are they being reasonable about their anti-homosexual agenda? I mean, in their worldview of final causation, it only makes sense to say that homosexuality and transgenderism are mistakes and privations of good, and therefore, immoral; let's face it, they have to take this route if they want to have the arguments they have for classical theism (and God)."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,Marthman,10,Wed Jul 1 03:59:21 2015 UTC,"their commitment [..] to final causation and substance/essence [..] dictates that they see gay/transgendered people as not being what they're supposed/meant to be.   It doesn't.  Perhaps their commitment to their particular interpretation of final causation dictates this, but it's hardly dictated by a commitment to final causation in general.  (Incidentally, the anti-homosexual impetus in Catholic theology has traditionally been directed not at being a gay person but rather at having gay sex.  One can of course argue that this distinction has an offensive premise, but whatever we make of it, the traditional issue for Catholic theology was not that so-and-so is a gay person and that's a bad thing to be but rather that so-and-so is having gay sex and that's a bad thing to do.)  It's not obvious that acceptance of final causality in general should entail commitments to anti-homosexuality, and there are extensive contentions surrounding how to understand and apply final causality that produce relevant interpretive scope here.  For instance, there's a dispute in Aristotle scholarship as to what the subject of the ethical analysis in Nicomachean Ethics is--is it the individual person, or is it the corporate body of persons?  I.e., in the first case, it's each individual which ought to adhere to the norms of this analysis; in the second case, it's people as a whole that ought to.  If we apply this distinction to the present case, we get the distinction between: each individual and their individual sex acts ought to be ordered toward the aim of procreation versus persons as a whole in their sex acts ought to be ordered toward the aim of procreation.  The former conclusion implies a problem for homosexual sex acts (and, though--suspiciously--it hardly gets the same amount of press, lots of heterosexual sex acts), whereas the latter conclusion doesn't--or at least doesn't, on the assumption that particular instances of homosexual sex acts are compatible with a general orientation of human sexual behavior toward procreation (which is at least a premise that seems highly plausible prima facie).  Incidentally, at least in the case of Aristotle, the correct answer to this interpretive issue is: the subject of the ethical analysis is the corporate body of persons, not the individual.  Indeed, rather ironically, people who turn to Aristotle for refuge from modernity are often inclined to anachronistically read back a lot of modern prejudices into Aristotle, and this idea that it's the individual which he's analyzing is an example of this kind of modern prejudice.   if someone argues from this Thomistic/Aristotelian framework, are they being reasonable about their anti-homosexual agenda?   I'm not quite sure what this means... do you mean, like, is there a case for anti-homosexuality which has some at least prima facie plausibility at least given some set of non-absurd premises, such as those provided by an Aristotelian-Thomistic framework?  Sure.  Although the beginning and concluding sections of Feser's post are horrible, the middle part is somewhat interesting--where he gives a Plantingian sort of argument for the necessity of a teleological metaphysics as the necessary condition of reason.  There are an awful lot of philosophical issues that need to be settled here, but he can at least give us an argument like this, or more directly the perverted faculties argument, for us to rationally appraise."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,wokeupabug,3,Wed Jul 1 04:27:54 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. Perhaps their commitment to their particular interpretation of final causation dictates this, but it's hardly dictated by a commitment to final causation in general   You worded it better I think. Perhaps it would have been better to say that final causality, within the Thomistic Framework which incorporates all Aristotelian causation, commits them to such a view.   (Incidentally, the anti-homosexual impetus in Catholic theology has traditionally been directed not at being a gay person but rather at having gay sex. One can of course argue that this distinction has an offensive premise, but whatever we make of it, the traditional issue for Catholic theology was not that so-and-so is a gay person and that's a bad thing to be but rather that so-and-so is having gay sex and that's a bad thing to do.)   Right, but what they are saying is that this person's homosexuality is an inherent flaw- a privation of the ""good;"" it's not just his actions (e.g. engaging in homosexual activity) that are a privation of the good.   Of course, a man's homosexuality may not really speak to his moral compass. A gay man may not be inherently immoral (on some interpretations); but, according to the Thomistic Framework that Feser provides, they are deficient, they are demonstrating a privation of the essence of what it is to be a man; and this is only further complicated by Thomism's concept of good/truth/being all being interchangeable.  To clear up what I wrote before:   I mean, in their worldview of final causation, it only makes sense to say that homosexuality and transgenderism are mistakes and privations of good, and therefore, immoral;   Homosexuality/transgenderism are mistakes and privations of the good; but it may not be the case that someone is immoral for just being gay/transgendered. Perhaps a Feserian Thomist would say that acting on your homosexuality/transgenderedness is immoral, but that just being it is just a demonstration of a privation of the good.  But if you take into account their concept of good/being/truth all being interchangeable, it's not hard to come to the conclusion that Thomists like Feser will come to the conclusion that even believing that you're gay or transgendered is immoral because you're saying that God makes mistakes, which he supposedly doesn't, especially when it comes to essences."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,Marthman,8,Wed Jul 1 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"Right, but what they are saying is that this person's homosexuality is an inherent flaw- a privation of the ""good;"" it's not just his actions (e.g. engaging in homosexual activity) that are a privation of the good.   According to the theology, fallen humanity's sexuality in general is flawed.  The church offers two solutions through which fallen sexuality is redeemed: the calling to the married life, and the calling to the celibate life.  In the first case, there's a clear disparity between the heterosexual and the homosexual, for supposedly only heterosexual acts are ordered to procreation, and supposedly the aim of the married life is procreation, so that only heterosexual acts can be redeemed in the calling to the married life.  Conversely, in answering the calling to the celibate life, the heterosexual and the homosexual are in the same position.  The sexual inclinations of both are disordered, this disorder is redeemed by both through answering the call to celibacy, and the sexuality of both is made holy through this redemption.  No doubt there are oodles of Catholics who just don't like homosexuals, no doubt Catholics tend suspiciously to apply Catholic sexual teachings to homosexuals with a fervor equal to the disinterest with which they ignore them when it comes to heterosexuals1, but there's no theological reason why a homosexual answering the call to celibacy is any less human or has any less redeemed their fallen sexuality than does a heterosexual answering the call to celibacy, and no theological reason why the heterosexual not called to marriage is under any less moral obligation than the homosexual to answer the call to celibacy.    This distinction between being a homosexual and doing homosexual acts is a long-standing and explicit thesis in Catholic theology.  If Feser doesn't discuss it, that's his business--but check with the Conference of Bishops or something, if it's Catholic doctrine you want to confirm.   And no doubt--from the outside perspective--this whole analysis rests on a disturbingly anemic notion of sexuality.    it's not hard to come to the conclusion that Thomists like Feser will come to the conclusion that even believing that you're gay or transgendered is immoral because you're saying that God makes mistakes, which he supposedly doesn't, especially when it comes to essences.   This just doesn't make any sense theologically, for reasons just noted."

The difference is that no heterosexual person really knows their vocation with absolute certainty--virtually no one claims that God tells them directly whether to get married or stay celibate--they just do what they're naturally drawn to because supposedly God wouldn't call you to one life but make you naturally drawn to another, or at least that's what I was taught.  However, if you're gay you know you can't get married because marriage is for straight people, so celibacy is an imposition, not something you'd necessarily want to do otherwise. No straight person has celibacy imposed on them the way gay people do in Catholicism. They say there's no such thing as a ""monkey on your back"" vocation like God nagging you into the priesthood against your wishes, but apparently it is that way with gay people and celibacy."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,smikims,3,Wed Jul 1 21:06:04 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree with all of this.  I was just drawing the comparison if we assume the life of celibacy.  Of course, the disparity when it comes to marriage introduces this additional difficulty which you note."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,wokeupabug,3,Wed Jul 1 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"According to the theology, fallen humanity's sexuality in general is flawed   Fair enough; this was outside the scope of my knowledge.   Conversely, in answering the calling to the celibate life, the heterosexual and the homosexual are in the same position. The sexual inclinations of both are disordered, this disorder is redeemed by both through answering the call to celibacy, and the sexuality of both is made holy through this redemption.   If there are religious doctrines that have declared this the case, okay then. But going off of the Thomistic system provided by Feser, I don't see how you can get to:   and the sexuality of both is made holy through this redemption.   Theologically speaking, there may have been band-aids applied to areas of the Thomistic framework that lead to unsavory conclusions. But it's possible that there are workarounds for these unwanted conclusions, without relying on ""band-aids by decree.""  For example, perhaps in speaking of the priest's penis, we could say that the penis, in and of itself, did not fulfill its teleological purpose. But Thomists could, perhaps, override the importance of the priest's penis's final cause, and appeal to the final cause of the priest himself, which would certainly be more complex than his sexual organ. It could even be said that, despite the privation of good exemplified by his penis's essence failing to fulfill its final cause, we may not say anything of the priest himself, as a human being, in terms of him lacking the good. (Aquinas could even argue that any act that is religiously motivated yet in conflict with a normal teleological end- e.g. becoming a priest who won't fulfill his procreative teleology- could be taken on faith and tenable/acceptable via revelation [""God wanted me to become a celibate priest, therefore, it's okay""]).  And I don't see any conflict with the priest having privations of the good in other aspects; for example, if his foot was missing a toe, this would also be a privation of  ""the good"" vis-a-vis the essence of his foot (but he wouldn't be immoral for missing the toe). In the same way, his not using his penis actively [in the correct way] may not be immoral in itself, despite it being an instantiation of the privation of ""the good.""   It's only when the penis is used for something that's not part of its essence's final cause (perhaps anything other than heterosexual sex and urination) when something immoral is being done. Theology can create a more nuanced picture here: while the essence of the penis is to be used as a tool in heterosexual intercourse (and perhaps urination), theology can go further and create idiosyncratic normative imperatives, e.g.: one should only use his penis for heterosexual acts within the confines of marriage.   but there's no theological reason why a homosexual answering the call to celibacy is any less human or has any less redeemed their fallen sexuality than does a heterosexual answering the call to celibacy   I feel like you're muddying the water and getting into a deeper issue here.  As you noted, human sexuality in general is flawed. I'm sure that Catholics would (or at least should, to remain consistent) say heterosexual foot-fetishists are as bad as homosexuals. Unsurprisingly, most Catholics do probably look down on such behavior, and would almost certainly shame it.  But outside of instances like that, there certainly seems to be a difference between ""being"" gay, or ""being"" a heterosexual (x)-fetishist, and ""being"" a heterosexual who happens to have engaged in some non-kosher sex acts.  For sure, your point stands with heterosexual pedophiles and homosexuals (not trying to invite comparison, just using an easy example). It is a part of that heterosexual's essence/nature to want to have sex with children, it's not something that he can just do without and be okay (in his own eyes)- the same can be said for the homosexual man- it is a part of his essence/nature to want to have sex with men, it's not something that he can just do without and be okay (in his own eyes).  But then you consider the heterosexual man who enjoys, but doesn't naturally need, blowjobs. It's really not the same as the pedophile or homosexual. The latter two need their objects of fixation for their happiness. The hetero man doesn't need blowjobs.  In short: the pedophile and homosexual have problems with who they are, essentially speaking, at least according to Thomas' system (and in light of your mention of the path to redemption, it's no wonder the Catholic church is riddled with both of these types of men). The heterosexual man doesn't, but we can still say he has done something wrong. But we're not saying of him, like the pedophile and homosexual, that something is wrong with his essential nature, as much as we say it is with his choices.  Some Catholics may try to soften the blow for the homosexuals they condemn through their Thomistic framework (if they subscribe to it understandingly), perhaps by saying that only choosing to act on your gayness is immoral.  But the point still stands that if you follow their reasoning to its conclusion, they are saying that pedophiles and homosexuals and zoophiles all have problems with their nature, essentially speaking, in a much different way than heterosexuals who have committed ""unclean"" acts, but aren't deficient in nature. Again, it's no surprise that religious folk often invite comparison to zoophiles and pedophiles when speaking of homosexuals, perhaps for this very reason.   This distinction between being a homosexual and doing homosexual acts is a long-standing and explicit thesis in Catholic theology.   And if I were to guess, just based on what I've read from Feser so far, the distinction may go something like:  Being a homosexual is being deficient in nature/essence, whereas committing homosexual acts without also being a homosexual is merely to commit a sin but not necessarily be deficient in nature/essence (rather, perhaps, misguided or confused- which again, just makes sense, given the existence of modern gay-conversion camps that try to brainwash people into thinking they're not really gay, but rather, that they were just mistaken in thinking such a thing [perhaps because God doesn't make mistakes]).  Further if you're a homosexual who refrains from committing homosexual acts, you're doing a morally good thing, in the same way a pedophile who refrains from touching children is doing a morally good thing; but your nature/essence is still deficient in either case- unlike the ""kosher heterosexual"" who may have engaged in sinful sexual acts before.   This just doesn't make any sense theologically, for reasons just noted.   Maybe not theologically, because of arbitrary ""bandaids"" applied by the church to the unsavory conclusions of their philosophical framework. But speaking within the framework that Thomas provides, it certainly seems to make sense [to completely turn a blind eye to modern notions of gender, the upshots of accepting the theory of evolution, etc]."

Of course, Aquinas was a huge proponent of analogical language, so it's possible that ""ends"" would be an example of such a concept."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,Marthman,2,Wed Jul 1 17:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's in scarequotes because it refers back to his previous parenthesis that identifies the word ""end"" as the translation of Aquinas' finis rather than a more general, non-Thomist understanding of the term.   I answer that, Matrimony is instituted both as an office of nature and as a sacrament of the Church. As an office of nature it is directed by two things, like every other virtuous act. one of these is required on the part of the agent and is the intention of the due end, and thus the ""offspring"" is accounted a good of matrimony; the other is required on the part of the act, which is good generically through being about a due matter; and thus we have ""faith,"" whereby a man has intercourse with his wife and with no other woman. Besides this it has a certain goodness as a sacrament, and this is signified by the very word ""sacrament."""
badphilosophy,3bpezr,Naejard,5,Wed Jul 1 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"Also this isn't the place for learns.   I know... it's just really difficult to not want to know more when you read someone like wokeup's posts.  I'm going to continue this conversation under the pretense that you may expect answers to the questions you posed in your reply, and hopefully I will be forgiven.   I'm surprised that few people ever call out these views on folk biology, e.g. sex is for procreation, so non-procreative sex is wrong. Who said sex is only for procreation?   But that's really a strawman of Feser's/Thomas's argument. I don't think there is an essence/substance of ""sex"" according to them, so they wouldn't say something like that.   What they would say is that the biological male's nature/essence dictates his final cause. So if you're born with an XY chromosomal pairing, then part of your final cause (part of the essence of being a male) is to procreate with females; if you don't, you're demonstrating a privation of the good.   An example Feser uses is quite simple: the heart's final cause is to pump and supply your body with blood, if it is to be ""good"" or [my own words] ""striving towards greatness/perfection"" (and if it didn't provide such services, it would lack ""the good,"" or be less good than a heart that did); similarly, I assume he would say that a [human] penis' final cause is to be a means of injecting a female with sperm to create children. The essence of a male penis is to insert baby-making fluids into female private parts; if it doesn't, it's not realizing it's final cause set out by God.  In short: they're avoiding the question of ""what is sex meant for?"" and instead saying, ""(x) substance is meant to perform (y) function.""   One behavior or structure can have many functions.    Functions don't necessarily match final causes, according to them.  A Grizzly bear's essence is to hibernate and eat salmon. But the bear has also demonstrated a(n accidental) capacity for being a popular mascot for sports teams. Bears can have the capacity for many ""functions,"" such as eating salmon and being sports teams' mascots, but some activities, such as the former, are what bears are ""meant to do,"" whereas the latter are just things that bears can incidentally act in the capacity of.  Similarly, penises can anally penetrate other males, but they're not meant to (according to their views). We can go further than this: penises aren't even meant to be put in mouths (anti-blowjob philosophy? fuck that), therefore, anything other than penises in vaginas is wrong (because in any other case, the penis wouldn't be actualizing its potential for the greatest ""good"").   And why assume that homosexuality isn't adaptive, especially when it seems to pop up all over the animal kingdom?   This type of question raised skeptically in the face of Thomistic essentialism/Aristotelian final causality is one of the reasons I have a hard time accepting either of them.   You may be begging the question a little bit with such a question though. Sure, it may be adaptive in some sense, but that's not what the Thomist is concerned with. He is concerned with a particular substance fulfilling its final cause, which every substance purportedly has."
badphilosophy,3bpezr,Marthman,3,Wed Jul 1 04:50:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is an essence/substance of ""sex"" according to them, so they wouldn't say something like that.    You sure? Pretty much the entire Catholic teaching on sexuality hinges on the existence of the essence of sex.   In short: they're avoiding the question of ""what is sex meant for?"" and instead saying, ""(x) substance is meant to perform (y) function.""   These aren't mutually exclusive, and these days pretty much all the arguments I see for the Catholic understanding of sexuality argue based on the essence of sex, not the essence of the genitals.   Similarly, penises can anally penetrate other males, but they're not meant to (according to their views). We can go further than this: penises aren't even meant to be put in mouths (anti-blowjob philosophy? fuck that), therefore, anything other than penises in vaginas is wrong (because in any other case, the penis wouldn't be actualizing its potential for the greatest ""good"").   I'll avoid ranting here, but I think it's funny that it only seems to be in the case of sex that doing something that is not according to the final cause is inherently wrong. I can use a butter knife to open a bottle of beer and no one cares, or even stick my dick in my wife's mouth because it feels good as long as I don't cum there (yes, some orthodox Catholics do defend this), but stick it in a dude's mouth for the same reason (and even with the no-cum stipulation) and it's a mortal sin."

badphilosophy,3bo28g,slickwom-bot,2,Wed Jul 1 03:06:05 2015 UTC,How can we put in a request for the sub?
badphilosophy,3bo28g,From_the_Underground,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:15:19 2015 UTC,/r/redditrequest. But the mods there are not inactive(the condition is that they have to be not even logged in for more than 60 days). Still...?
badphilosophy,3bo28g,shannondoah,3,Tue Jun 30 20:16:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I think the only thing to do is just bombard the sub with good posts and comments. But we can't do it alone, we need a team."
badphilosophy,3bo28g,From_the_Underground,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:04 2015 UTC,I'd be down for a team effort. But I don't know if I have enough decent content to flood out the bullshit.
badphilosophy,3bo28g,From_the_Underground,2,Tue Jun 30 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Idk if we need a ton of content rather than education initiatives. It seems some people there know what existentialism is, at least, and they'll be added in. Like that tattoo post. Wtf is that?   Anyway, I'm sure if all of us find a few articles or something, it'll be enough to bore the casuals away."
badphilosophy,3bo28g,From_the_Underground,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"Never mind, was modded. Now don't be jerks!"
badphilosophy,3bo28g,From_the_Underground,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:11:19 2015 UTC,"Srsly? I contacted their mods weeks ago, no response. Will you mod me as well? U/shannondoah might also be interested. I have the beginnings of a plan to improve that sub."
badphilosophy,3bo28g,shannondoah,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:32:02 2015 UTC,I suspect it has something to do with naejard saying I'm sartre's grand godson. I gonna ask the mods since I don't want it to seem like an ambush which will crush all hope.
badphilosophy,3bo28g,shannondoah,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, be diplomatic of course. For me, you might mention that I'm a regular contributor to other philosophy subs, that I have a BA in philosophy, and that I did my capstone project on Sartre."
badphilosophy,3bo28g,shannondoah,0,Tue Jun 30 22:22:33 2015 UTC,"/u/From_the_Underground , please?"
badphilosophy,3bo28g,LinuxFreeOrDie,0,Tue Jun 30 21:38:35 2015 UTC,I think the only thing to do is just bombard the sub with good posts and comments.   We ABSOLUTELY MUST!
