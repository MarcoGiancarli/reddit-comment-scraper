HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,binarycomplex,22,Wed Jul 22 06:04:52 2015 UTC,Thats why murder-suicide is best
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,Villainsoft,25,Wed Jul 22 07:00:40 2015 UTC,I think the best solution is to have no one love you and to die quietly. Alone. Forgotten.
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,Villainsoft,8,Wed Jul 22 07:08:52 2015 UTC,Nice and tidy solution. Efficient and elegant.
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,CommanderCooper,8,Wed Jul 22 07:22:45 2015 UTC,"Suicide. It's the one chance to take control of your death. Why die because of some outside force? Drunk driver, stray bullet, disease? Fuck that I'd rather take control for once."
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,JohnBoyAndBilly,4,Wed Jul 22 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I want to live for as long as possible. I may die someday under circumstances I can't control, but suicide would just be a waste of days I could have lived."
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,Victorhcj,3,Wed Jul 22 07:57:21 2015 UTC,These are the words of someone who isn't experiencing a level of emotional or physical pain enough to warrant suicide.
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,copypaste_93,2,Wed Jul 22 14:03:49 2015 UTC,Dying of old age is kinda suicide as well. If you're 85 why even bother killing yourself? Might as well enjoy yourself a couple more years and then die. If I had bone cancer or something and I'm gonna die in 3 months and it's gonna be painful then yeah I would speed up the process
HorriblyDepressing,3e628b,Victorhcj,2,Wed Jul 22 10:10:05 2015 UTC,I dont know man. i work with seniors all day. i would probably off myself before the point of going to a home. that shit sucks.

HorriblyDepressing,3e1emb,PhantomPigRider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:00:00 2015 UTC,Because the conferdate flag will always be racist for those who want it to be.
HorriblyDepressing,3e1emb,TheSownReaper,6,Tue Jul 21 07:35:53 2015 UTC,"The Confederate flag IS racist. It stood for states who wanted to keep the right to own people because of their skin color. It was a flag that flew on the wrong side of history. Defending someones right to fly or display a confederate flag is the same as defending someones right to display a Nazi flag. Many Germans have Nazi heritage, but how many do you see parading it? And the ones who are parading it are ostracized IMMENSELY.  Sure, in America the government shouldn't ban individuals from their rights, but if you stand behind something that has a history of nothing but hate, you shouldn't expect the people around you, individuals who are not directly a part of the government, to treat you with respect or welcome you with open arms.  There is no reason to be proud that your ancestors fought for the right to own people. I have a relative who fought for the confederacy. I don't stand by him. I don't support his actions. I am not fucking proud that he fought for such a shitty cause.  The flag is racist. It always will be."
HorriblyDepressing,3e1emb,cobo10201,2,Tue Jul 21 08:04:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in NY are getting butthurt over the taking down of the confederate flag.  The vast majority of them are people who are from southern and eastern Europe whose progenitors immigrated here after 1900. The blacks they look down on have longer lineages here than those folks do. They must understand that once, being a Catholic Italian, Irish or Eastern European was akin to how Trump views Mexicans. Grow up idiots. The flag symbolizes oppression, repression and hatred. Don't glorify it as standing up to the government. Many men died to keep this union together."
HorriblyDepressing,3e1emb,varanone,-9,Tue Jul 21 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Do you think the south only fought for slavery? They also fought for their own independent state, My ancestors fought on the union side. I don't hate him just because they did, I just respect that one part of America came together as a whole to fight for their cause. Lord knows whenever that's going to happen again.   You can believe the flag is racist or not but it's a lot more than just slavery that made the Confederate flag come to be."
HorriblyDepressing,3e1emb,TheSownReaper,11,Tue Jul 21 08:34:35 2015 UTC,"The reason was slavery. They came together because they believed in slavery. Anybody who says that the American Civil War was about anything more than slavery is delusional or ignorant. Check the facts here in each declaration by each state.  Georgia, first paragraph, second sentence:   For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.   Mississippi, second paragraph, first sentence:   Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.   South Carolina, first paragraph, first sentence:   The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, on the 26th day of April, A.D., 1852, declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right.   Texas, third paragraph, third sentence:   She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time.   Virginia, first paragraph, first sentence (whole paragraph is a long sentence so I am only copying the relevant part):   ...; and the Federal Government, having perverted said powers, not only to the injury of the people of Virginia, but to the oppression of the Southern Slaveholding States.   Read the entirety of each declaration yourself. After that, tell me the secession and subsequent war wasn't about slavery.  I don't respect them for this. You shouldn't respect anyone just because they fought for a common cause, especially if the cause was a shitty one."

I never understand it, there are so many fucking horrible things in the world that millions of people have to endure, some don't endure it, they FUCKING DIE, from whatever trauma it is, some people kill themselves.   There are so many people not just in this country but in all of them that have horrible lives with no semblance of happiness or rest, to stop and appreciate life.   Sure this guy was healthy at one point in his life, but now hes not, and hes gotta be fucking grateful for dying at a young fucking age from cancer?   Its a fucking joke.  People can't stand to see the reality that life is fucking horrible and will drain the life out of you at any moment or over the course of your whole life.   So we teach our fucking kids and others to ""APPRECIATE LIFE, ITS A GIFT""  Fuck that a happy, successful life is a gift. Anything else is no different than being thrown into an Arena where you fight for your life.   Thats all life fucking is.   Get the fuck over this shit. Fucking religion, ""oh hes in a better place now""  Sit around thinking its okay to lie to somebody about life and death and shit because its easier to remain in ignorance rather than face reality that all those people that died ACTUALLY ARE FUCKING DEAD.

But even if I did, I'd find it very hard to worship such a being that finds it's needed to give us all these things you stated. Like friends, family, wife/husband and watch it all be taken away at young age. Its a premature death.  And yet some people deny these facts. I don't mind letting people practice religion even though I disagree with it.

How did this man live a fulfilling life? How is any of this shit a gift to him.   Dude life is life, its a fucking hard road.  But please omg, I wish people would shut the fuck about life being a gift.   Edit Downvote because opinion."

HorriblyDepressing,3cdvgk,DantesInporno,12,Tue Jul 7 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"Haha damn I didn't think it was that depressing. However this next part kind of is.  For clarity: My parents split up when I was about 3 and divorced when I was 4. I have very vivid memories of the day they split up. I don't remember where we were going but my sister and I were sitting in the back seat of our family's mini van and our father was digging through my mother's purse. I remember our mother coming out of the house and asking why he was digging in her purse. I don't remember his exact answer but I know there was yelling. She came down the steps from the house to the car port and I remember seeing him shove her into a metal pole that supported the car port. I have never felt as much pure horror as I did in that moment. I remember my sister and I looked at each other right then screaming. After that he chased her into the house where she was trying to get the phone to call the police. This was in the 90s so we had a phone that was mounted on the wall. I don't remember if he pushed her again and that's what knocked the phone off the wall or if he just punched it but either way it was disconnected. I don't know exactly what else happened and it's been years since anyone in my family has talked about it so I don't remember the rest of the story exactly. Plus my sister and I were still in the van when he chased her into the house. However I do have vivid memories related to it that may be out of order but they are as follows:   I remember looking out window of our house and seeing the police walking up to the front door and asking my mother why they were there and begging her not to let them take ""daddy"" away. I remember moving to my mother's hometown to live with my grandparents. I always thought that this happened immediately after he pushed her but after thinking about it to tell reddit this story I guess it would've been at least the next day. I remember going with my mother and sister to pick up my father from jail. I kept asking my mother why she was getting him out if he hit her and all she would say was ""I don't know."" I also remember that my second biggest concern was if he had to wear a black and white striped uniform like in cartoons. I think they might have been bright yellow jumpsuits but I don't know why that stands out.   Anyway I know we got out of there quick. He had never been abusive toward my mother before. He had however been cheating on her possibly with multiple women. She caught him at some point by his emails to other women but I don't know or want to know exactly what they said. He ended up dating and marrying one of the women he cheated on my mother with. They're still married to this day. I was forced by the Alabama court system to ""visit"" him every three weeks for a few years until it was bumped up to every other week for several more years. There were many times throughout my childhood that one party or the other would have to call the police, many times it ended with an officer physically lifting me and carrying me, kicking and screaming, to my father's car. I hated visitation with my father. I'd have to travel usually 4-6 hours in a car depending on where his job took him then pretend to enjoy myself and be someone I wasn't for fear of being abused. He never made the effort to travel to us and get a hotel for visitation weekends. He made me miss important events like friends birthday parties or Boy Scout camp outs. We were supposed to spend our entire spring break with him in either my eighth or ninth grade year but my sister and I refused to get out of our mother's car and go with him. We waited in a gas station parking lot for around six hours until he left and then our mother took us home. The courts never changed the order but they never enforced it again. I've seen my father maybe four or five times since then (about 7-8 years ago) and I'll be perfectly happy never seeing him again."

Adjustable gastric band surgery is an example of bariatric surgery designed for obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or greater — or between 35 and 40 in cases of patients with certain comorbidities that are known to improve with weight loss, such as sleep apnea, diabetes, osteoarthritis, GERD, Hypertension (high blood pressure), or metabolic syndrome, among others.  In February 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) expanded approval of adjustable gastric bands to patients with a BMI between 30 to 40 and one weight-related medical condition, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. However, an adjustable gastric band may be used only after other methods such as diet and exercise have been tried.

It's possible that she threatened him with all sorts of things, from blaming it on him to beating them until they died. These people are crazy manipulative and excellent with their words. You can't beat them without video evidence. Yes, he could have stopped it. But then they would have to go to trial for the children after the divorce, splitting visitation in the meantime, and it would turn into a he-said-she-said. And, while that trial is going on, the children would be in her care 100% of the time (taking the children and moving out is not legally feasible in some states, and the court would order temporary, forced 50/50 visitation). In that time, she could beat the kids senseless and force them to claim that their dad did it in exchange for fewer beatings. It's unfortunate, but they wouldn't have a choice.

I've been both homeless and evicted in my life, and the overwhelming sense of helplessness is fucking crushing.  THAT BEING SAID - evicting someone is a process. And a pretty lengthy one at that. Most times you have to be like, months late on payments before they even start the eviction process. And then you have usually 30 or 60 days. Hell, I've seen some places that give 90 days.   What I'm trying to say, is that it's not like you miss rent one day and this is what your lawn looks like the next day. Now, I clearly don't know the story here, and there are freak cases of unjust eviction. But maybe the person whose stuff this is is kind of a  shithead, and decided to stop paying bills.   It's a terrible way of looking at bad life situations, but I've been in those situations myself enough times to know that it's not always the world that sucks, but sometimes you do."

If you’re the person being called one, of course it is, but so would be “imbecile,” “nincompoop,” “nitwit,” “birdbrain,” and “jackass.” Each has its own nuance and linguistic register, and if “schmuck” is nastier sounding than most of them, this probably has more to do with its rhyming with a certain other English word than with its meaning in Yiddish. It certainly isn’t like “kike.” I may despise another Jew and still be outraged by hearing him called a kike. Call him a schmuck, and I’ll say, “You bet he is.”"

I had really long hair when the year started, but managed to get it cut shorter and shorter every 6 weeks when retort cards came out because my grades were below what was expected.  She didn't do it herself, at least she took me to fantastic Sam's. By the end of the year, my hair fell even with the bottoms of my ears and they were starting to shave the back. I looked like a medieval page boy. Hated it so much.  My mom realized that the punishment wasn't working like she wanted it to, so she gave it up in 8th grade.  It's traumatized me, I'll never forget it. But I never really thought about it as abuse.   But it's probably the reason that I only get my hair cut every 12-18 months."

I cried and screamed, and everyone ignored that what they were doing wasn't my choice, but my mother's, and that she didn't have the right to alter my body without my consent anymore. I was 11. She offered my candy to calm me down. I told her no. It was the worst day of my year. Kids made fun of me, called me a boy and a lesbian for no reason other than my short hair (because long hair was stylish), and after that I stopped getting my hair cut for 3 years, grew it out, and donated it on MY terms. Then I dyed it blue and spikey to show her she can't do shit to me.  It's totally awful what your mum did to you. You reach a certain age range where your body becomes your responsibility and only you own the right to do anything to it. It's almost a form of mutiliation.

Shit,will this get me banned from /r/horriblydepressing for not siding with the overwhelming majority? Who knows,but i'm sure i'll get some fun messages when i get back from Ant Man."

HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,yellowtag,15,Mon Jun 8 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not, and never plan to be one, however my opinion is valid, nonetheless."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Blue_Opheliac,11,Mon Jun 8 14:17:45 2015 UTC,Watch out r/parenting is leaking. Been seeing this on a lot of subs recently. Whether or not you have kids your opinion is valid on issues such as this. R/parenting thinks otherwise.
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Idrkc,4,Mon Jun 8 15:20:59 2015 UTC,Weird.   Whenever someone comes to /r/networking and has never managed any kind of network we still totally take what they have to say seriously.  Same over at /r/science.   I can't imagine anyone expecting people to know wtf they're talking about before actually posting it.   Those shitlords.
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,farfigneugan,6,Mon Jun 8 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"You know that would make sense. But the thing about kids and how to raise them is, everyone has a different opinion and people get hostile for no reason about it. Kind of strange how everyone wants to force their opinions on everyone else there. Very toxic community there. But you know, it's not like my opinion on how shitty your brat is matters or anything. I'm only a member of the society you and your child inhabit."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Idrkc,-10,Mon Jun 8 16:20:44 2015 UTC,"Your opinion is your opinion and that doesn't make it valid. Legally the father does have the right to do what he did. It doesn't make it right any more than your opinion is valid.   His major failure was waiting too long to establish dominance over his daughter. If he would have done this when she was 10-11 then she would most likely have been fine, traumatized but fine. If he would have had the iron fist when she was preschool age and kept up his dominance then this would have never had to happen.   The sooner you can put the fear of god into a child the better. The sooner it happens the less pushback you get from the child as they grow. If the child had the fear of god then she never would have done the things she did to cause her father to react this way.  This is all the fathers fault and I don't condone his methods but his heart was probably in the right place his methods were just flawed. The father must have really loved and cared about his child's decisions to take the steps he did to try and regain control (if he didn't care he would have let her run wild without doing anything) but he was just too late."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Auzarin,6,Tue Jun 9 14:12:15 2015 UTC,"You are by far the most fucked up commenter I've ever had to deal with. You contradict yourself by saying 'Traumatized, but fine'. What gives this father the right to chop off his daughter's hair? What if he pulled out her nails? Or scarred her? It's the same fucking thing. And now because of him, his kid is dead."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Blue_Opheliac,-7,Tue Jun 9 14:36:27 2015 UTC,"You could equate traumatized to ""nails pulled out"" vs. ""but fine"" to nails trimmed short.   He didn't rip the hair out of her head, he just cut it off. As his right as a parent allows him."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Auzarin,6,Tue Jun 9 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"What gives him the parental right? Okay, so he has the right to decide what colour hair she has? How she wears it? What she wears? What she says? Where she pursues college? Or a job? When does his 'control' end? When is she considered adult enough to decide how to treat her own fucking body? Because at 13, I think she's old enough."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Blue_Opheliac,0,Tue Jun 9 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"18 is the age your looking for, until then she's just a minor."

Maybe when he goes online and recieves the backlash from the internet, he'll understand exactly what his daughter was afraid of facing when she went to school with butchered hair."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Blue_Opheliac,-5,Wed Jun 10 06:19:54 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. Tell the circumcision doctor, he'll laugh in your face."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,Auzarin,-3,Wed Jun 10 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"i dunno, i think the severity of the reaction might be coloring your view of this.  cutting her hair did not physically hurt her, and he was ostensibly doing it to teach her a lesson for messing up. the worst part in my mind was having it on the internet to publicly shame and mock her.  many people would disagree with you about the appropriate level of control a parent should hold over their 13 year old.  i think it is a very tragic ending to a situation, but also a rare one. when they gave that little boy an old man haircut everyone thought it was funny and the kid had no lasting damage."
HorriblyDepressing,38yxy5,ragnaROCKER,3,Wed Jun 10 00:53:33 2015 UTC,"I disagree. You should NEVER reenforce a punishment by physically altering your child. Whether it's to hurt them, shame them, or teach them a lesson, it's THEIR body. People campaign for children to have bodily autonomy all the time, and for children to be able to grow up confident and become good people. This is a chain effect. And it can escalate. What was this girl getting her hair cut could have turned into her own form of innapropriate punishment. People were shocked when 'hot sauce mom' and 'cold showr mom' surfaced. Kids eat spicy food all the time, kids play in the cold during winter... The KEY difference is when that becomes a punishment that can harm your child mentally, emotionally, or physically. This was mental and emotional abuse, and him filming it to get some diagusting justice boner from the internet is even worse. I hope he feels like shit forever, because her death falls on HIS hands. It did rhe moment he left his distraught daughter staring at her pile of hair."

HorriblyDepressing,38ulbz,sleepinggun,27,Sun Jun 7 01:09:46 2015 UTC,I'd say not knowing what actually happens after is the scary part for most people.   Fear of the unknown is pretty powerful.

The other is that you understand the nature of existence, and everyone else shares a common misunderstanding, which you still fail to understand.

HorriblyDepressing,38pttz,Creakier,32,Fri Jun 5 20:37:29 2015 UTC,Apparently the pain is so intense that many people who get them seriously consider killing themselves to escape them. I guess that's why another name for them is Suicide Headaches...
HorriblyDepressing,38pttz,AvakJHawk,31,Fri Jun 5 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"In middle school, I used to suffer from severe migraines and have been to that point. The most clear memory of them is one time when I was in the passenger seat of my father's car, covered in vomit, and screaming in pain while trying to force the door open so I could jump out into traffic and kill myself. I was so out of it at the time that I didn't realize I was seatbelted in.   That was really the only type of thing that kept me alive through them. The pain was so severe, I'd fail to notice minor things which would prevent suicide long enough for a family member to come intervene. After a few years, I finally realized (through no help of doctors - they were always useless) that they were hormone-related, and I was able to completely eradicate them by stabilizing hormone levels.   To be honest, I'm not even sure if ""suicide"" is the correct word. That generally implies making a decision to kill oneself. When someone is in pain that severe, there's no longer any capability for decision-making left. You sort of revert into a semi-conscious state that consists of absolutely nothing besides ""make the pain stop.""  I can't even imagine how it is for people with cluster headaches. From what I hear, it's many times more painful than even the worst of migraines. This video was seriously disturbing though, since it very closely resembles how I used to act during the worst periods. I'm currently covered in sweat and shaking a bit just from watching it."
HorriblyDepressing,38pttz,Lady_Bernkastel,-11,Fri Jun 5 21:43:28 2015 UTC,"Neuro-Tech here, the amount of hormones it would take to do this would disfigure you at a developmental age and I find it highly unlikely any spark of what you just said is true based off that."
HorriblyDepressing,38pttz,Danger_Jahrens,6,Wed Jun 10 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"Seriously? It's extremely common for migraines to start right torward the beginning of puberty, then get far less severe once the sufferrer reaches their 20s and hormones are more stable. A lot of family members have also had them, and their experiences all match this pattern. I can't think of anyone who's told me they were always there, it's always ""They started when I was in 6th/7th/8th grade.""  I spent several years just bouncing between neurologists who would, at best, give something that might reduce (rarely stop) the migraine five to ten times before being rendered ineffective. A few long-term medications were tried, but the only one that helped at all was Topamax. My father forced them to take me off it, because the side effect was that I sort of stopped caring about anything, very similar to the side-effects of some anti-depressants. His description for it was ""zombie-like.""  After a few years of that (the migraines were already becoming less severe on their own at this point, but were still horribly bad,) I ended up going to an endocrinologist for a completely unrelated matter. She ran a blood test and found my hormone levels to be WAY outside of normal ranges. I was prescribed spironolactone, then noticed maybe a month later that I hadn't had any truly severe migraines in a while, just really minor ones. This was pretty rare, but I'd had ""good months"" before and chalked it up as one of them. The next time I went back, she ran another blood test, then increased the dosage. I've had exactly one headache that could be classified as a true migraine since then, and it was extremely tame compared to how they were in middle school. As far as your claim that I'd be disfigured, I'm not sure if that's the correct word, but let's just say that I was at the endocrinologist for a reason. It's not something I want to elaborate further on, given that some people I know in real life are familiar with my reddit handle.  To make it more clear, I don't think it was hormones directly causing the migraines. There likely is a neurological component, with the hormone levels acting as a trigger of sorts. Either way, treating the hormone imbalance fixed them, so that's good enough for me. Attempting to attack them from a neurological standpoint didn't accomplish much of anything.   I hate how every time I post anything personal online, there's always someone scanning through it, looking for any reason to call bullshit. This is how things happened for me. I honestly don't see what's even so unbelievable about it, but I doubt it's possible to change your mind at this point short of putting up my entire medical record or something."

HorriblyDepressing,38pttz,Pointless_arguments,9,Sat Jun 6 10:35:50 2015 UTC,"Sort of. In the short-term, it gives some relief. Long-term, it can make the headache worse after stopping, but when you're in that level of pain, short term is all the matters to you. Being hit ""distracts"" your brain by creating a different pain to focus on. Interestingly, it helps way more if the place you hit is close to the source of pain. Hitting somewhere else on the body would cause you to feel both the headache pain and the pain from being hit (though that would be pretty much nothing compared to the headache.) If the location that's hit is extremely close to the source of the headache pain, it creates a fraction of a second where all that you feel is the pain from being hit, and the headache pain seems to fade. Cluster headaches don't usually last very long, so the head hitting probably works out better overall. When I used to have migraines (sometimes lasting several weeks), it wasn't exactly sustainable, since it would cause the headache to get worse as soon as I stopped. I'd still end up doing it anyway, at least until someone would hear the noise and stop me."

Alternatively, I could possibly imagine an emotional mother in law censuring the note because it was 'too sad' - which only occurs to me because after my brother died I had a bit of trouble with an aunt who had taken the last photo of him and who was a bit reluctant to send a copy.

HorriblyDepressing,37ayma,Guyjp,8,Tue May 26 12:22:27 2015 UTC,Because when you commit suicide you are no longer living.  Also known as dying.

HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,ToroidalATLAS,3,Sun May 24 19:32:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The original commenter can just come out and tell me I'm wrong and he won't feel bad about my comments because he know they can't be applied on him. However, I think I'm right and maybe he needs someone to tell him what could be a good direction."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Revules,3,Sun May 24 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"For one, anxiety isn't all in one's head, there's a significant amount of your nervous system in your gut as well, which is part of it. For two, being all in your head doesn't make something any less real- consider that a stroke is all in your head too. For three, getting away from the literal meaning, people with anxiety know all too well that it's a product of their own mind, but that doesn't make fixing it any easier."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Malfeasant,-4,Mon May 25 01:24:53 2015 UTC,"The nervous system in the gut is not related to it. Comparing a stroke to anxiety is comparing apples and pears. People need to tell you what it is they should do differently, because they make excuses in their head to not get out of the comfort zone. For example, the original poster thinks he is ugly, which is probably a product of his own mind."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Revules,2,Mon May 25 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"ok genius, now how does one fix it?"
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Malfeasant,-3,Mon May 25 08:26:01 2015 UTC,"I study biomedical sciences so I actually know something about that. I explained in my other comments how I think it could be fixed, and how I fixed it when I was younger."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Revules,2,Mon May 25 11:03:18 2015 UTC,"There is a pretty clear correlation there, even if it doesn't apply to everybody."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,ToroidalATLAS,11,Sun May 24 21:14:22 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with those hobbies. You can be attractive and be into gaming or anime.
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Russz,11,Sun May 24 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"That's true. However, it's not 1 game subreddit he's posting in. Watching multiple animes and playing multiple games takes a lot of time which suggests the person doesn't take part in a lot of social activities or other hobbies. Also, they provide no opportunity to get out of the comfort zone. You can just game or watch anime with no effort and it requires no social interaction, which makes it so easy to spend hours after hours on those hobbies."
HorriblyDepressing,372rrv,Revules,4,Sun May 24 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"Different kinds of hobbies can make you more attractive (cooking, fitness, hiking, etc) while I have never seen gaming/anime passion as a plus. So that's something."

No one was hurt in the fire, which was discovered in a second-floor bedroom at 325 W. Windsor St. shortly after noon, officials said.  Two residents - Amanda Moser, 31, and her husband Shamel English, age unavailable - were home when the fire broke out.  Moser's mother, Diane Fritz, who lives with them, said Moser was sleeping when English alerted her to the smoke.  They ushered their two pit bulls out of home but one of the animals, a female named Gemini, ran back inside and succumbed to smoke.  ""She must have gotten scared and then ran straight back into the house,"" said Fritz, sobbing. ""They (firefighters) brought her out, but by then she had passed on.""  Besides her daughter and son-in-law, Fritz's other daughter Angela, 27, and Fritz's six grandchildren live in the home. The name of a fifth adult living there was unavailable.  Fritz said the family found Gemini when she was about three weeks old in an alley.  Firefighters who rescued Gemini tried to resuscitate the pit bull on the sidewalk in front of the home.  ""She was more than a dog,"" English said, ""she was a part of our family.""  English carried the lifeless dog to a nearby porch and placed it under a blanket.  The other dogs that died were Chihuahuas.  English, his wife and mother-in-law locked in a crying embrace on the sidewalk.  In the aftermath of the fire, the lone surviving dog, a male pit bull named Poe, was tied up a few door's down on the porch of neighbor Myra Montanez.  ""Everyone loved Gemini,"" Montanez said. ""She was a happy dog.""  The American Red Cross Berks Chapter will be assisting the family.  Fritz said the fire appeared to have started in an outlet and was electrical in nature.  The city fire marshal's office is investigating the cause.  Second Deputy Fire Chief Thomas Kemery consoled family members, saying there is nothing they could have done to save the pets. He noted people have died going back into burning building to retrieve belongings and pets.  ""I'm a dog handler myself and I know what it's like to lose a pet,"" Kemery said. ""I empathize with him (English), but the human hazards take precedence over the animals' lives.""  Contact Steven Henshaw: 610-371-5028 or shenshaw@readingeagle.com."

But the person that committed that act is no longer here - I am. I'm not going to struggle physically against any restraints. I'm not going to shout, use profanity or make idle threats. Understand though that I'm not only upset, but I'm saddened by what is happening here tonight. I'm not only saddened, but disappointed that a system that is supposed to protect and uphold what is just and right can be so much like me when I made the same shameful mistake. If someone tried to dispose of everyone here for participating in this killing, I'd scream a resounding, ""No."" I'd tell them to give them all the gift that they would not give me...and that's to give them all a second chance. I'm sorry that I am here. I'm sorry that you're all here. I'm sorry that John Luttig died. And I'm sorry that it was something in me that caused all of this to happen to begin with. Tonight we tell the world that there are no second chances in the eyes of justice...Tonight, we tell our children that in some instances, in some cases, killing is right. This conflict hurts us all, there are no SIDES. The people who support this proceeding think this is justice. The people that think that I should live think that is justice. As difficult as it may seem, this is a clash of ideals, with both parties committed to what they feel is right. But who's wrong if in the end we're all victims? In my heart, I have to believe that there is a peaceful compromise to our ideals. I don't mind if there are none for me, as long as there are for those who are yet to come. There are a lot of men like me on death row - good men - who fell to the same misguided emotions, but may not have recovered as I have. Give those men a chance to do what's right. Give them a chance to undo their wrongs. A lot of them want to fix the mess they started, but don't know how. The problem is not in that people aren't willing to help them find out, but in the system telling them it won't matter anyway. No one wins tonight. No one gets closure. No one walks away victorious."

There are a lot of reasons to fake it, mainly to get help to come in. But in addition, it simply can be faked, whereas open wounds are much harder to fake. This seems very ugly minded, I suppose. But the fact is, it can faked more easily. The first footage I saw was a lot of shakey camera stuff. In the stuff I saw on the program, a lot could have been. It's awful to put it that way, but it seems possible. Is it fully verified now?"

As the front line pushed past them They were gradually surrounded with nothing but a small contested sliver of territory left for them to be resupplied, APC's have to run a gauntlet of fire to even get close to reaching them.  Eventually even that lifeline was closed off and after months of non stop fighting, up and down the Airport and its buildings against Rebels, Russian troops and Special forces they were eventually surrounded in the terminal itself and destroyed.  These men were given the name of Cyborg by both Rebels and Ukranian soldiers for their lack of fear in the face of certain death and bravery to hold an area deep in Enemy territory and preventing its strategic use, surrounded from all sides by superior forces they held for months before ultimately meeting their demise.  The ceiling you see in the video I believe was destroyed but some sort of powerful explosive, most men in this video are likely all dead as this seems to be close to the 18th when they made their final stand..   This is an example of one of the Terminal they fought in, often they fought a desperate fight floor to floor, room to room ,they held part of the basement and the ground floor while repelling Russian Soldiers on the 2nd and Rebel infiltrators from outside the terminal. http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/04/61/05/17_big.jpg  Vice has a good short documentary on them when most were still alive and the airport was still held by Ukraine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP1GN_oMd48  TLDR: Ukrainian Alamo."

This followed an earlier battle over control of the airport in May 2014, which left it in Ukrainian hands. The new battle was sparked despite a ceasefire agreement, called the Minsk Protocol, that had been in place from 5 September. At the start of the battle, the airport was the last part of Donetsk city held by government forces, and it lies between the separatist and Ukrainian lines of control. Heavy fighting over the airport continued into the new year, with some of the worst fighting having taken place in January 2015. On 21 January, DPR forces overran the government's positions at the airport.  The remaining Ukrainian forces were either killed, forced to retreat, or captured.

HorriblyDepressing,31sjoh,optimates,22,Tue Apr 7 20:51:59 2015 UTC,I have a link to a depressing one as well. A middle-aged schizophrenic male-to-female transsexual who has delusions of her doctor mutilating her during surgery.  https://www.youtube.com/user/meccagirl0/videos
HorriblyDepressing,31sjoh,tuckmyjunksofast,7,Tue Apr 7 22:59:07 2015 UTC,That was just weird.
HorriblyDepressing,31sjoh,Anal-Fluids,-15,Wed Apr 8 02:37:49 2015 UTC,male-to-female transsexual   Her voice is masculine and she looks like a man. Maybe her surgery was indeed botched.
HorriblyDepressing,31sjoh,newspaper_nerd,6,Wed Apr 8 08:16:28 2015 UTC,Her delusion is that the doctor overheard a conversation she had in her room that he somehow connected back to a username in a forum and decided to inject her with embalming fluid causing nerve damage. She refuses mental health treatment and thinks that anybody in the healthcare system is connected to that doctor and out to get her.
HorriblyDepressing,31sjoh,tuckmyjunksofast,5,Wed Apr 8 10:50:05 2015 UTC,"Hooolyy tits that whole channel reminds me of my own dads channel. Not in the transsexual theme, but I can understand that a little as I am ftm and have had horrible times with paranoia and hallucinations, delusions, etc when I was younger before I got onto meds and in therapy recent years.  My parents, especially my dad, and my brother is involved too now, run a youtube channel where they spam tonnes of weird videos about them pretty much harassing police officers, drs, council workers etc yelling about how vaccines damaged me and that they are all ""corrupt kidnappers"". I got taken out of that family because they were horribly abusive people and I'm in foster care now. It's been a few years since I've seen them but I sometimes peep at their channel and see new updates. It's so damn creepy."

It is bad that we don't recognize it.

Africa is home to the world's fastest growing economies, and most people there work hard for money we would laugh at. Same for south asia. I didn't compare ""those people"" to those in africa, I contrasted them, fast food workers here get a safe job with steady pay and still manage to complain, while people in the ship breaking yards in africa/asian work harder in hellish conditions."

Took me 6.5 years to finish college, my friends came and went. I graduated mid-year beside pretty much nobody I knew.  I had to work hard to raise my GPA to barely passing just because of how much I tanked it early on. My first job out of school was great, don't get me wrong, but I hyped up what I did to everyone around me because the reality of it wasn't as glamorous. Gotta keep up with the Joneses, right? Sadly, everyone thinks that and everyone is doing it.  Struggle with depression myself. Finding one good friend helps. Psychotherapy has helped, more so after I found the right one. Finally broke down and took mild help from meds, too, and that has helped  My life is on track now, the struggles are real and they never fully go away, but I'd like to think that ultimately I'm better for it.  So yeah, wishing you the best. I think you'll do fine. Better than you yourself think, anyway, because we are our own worst critics. If you ever wanna talk / rant, feel free to PM me.  Cheers."

I just decided enough was enough and did everything in my power to make myself more marketable. I worked my ass off at the job and applied every opportunity I could. Eventually I landed some interviews with the confidence that I had real world decision making experience. I just landed an awesome job which I am moving to another state for. Don't give up.

Kids make fun of each other all the time, it’s part of social bonding.   I was all for this anti bullying stuff, because when I was at school I’d get into just as much trouble as the kid twice my size who’d kick my teeth in for no reason. But this is just silly."

HorriblyDepressing,30ojxm,Overtoast,-29,Sun Mar 29 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"Thank fuck I'm not the only one who thought this sounded like dramatic narration. I hate the way this fucker spoke. He talked like he was trying his hardest to make you care.  Lemme tell you about bullying. I had a lot of this shit happen to me in school. I got called lots of names, was fairly unpopular, had sports balls thrown at me in gym, and generally wanted to avoid people.  One day, in 10th grade, I decided I'd had it with the faggots in gym. The ""leader"" of the group who picked on me the most was this gay little scene kid who had lip piercings and a pussy side-fringe. Earlier that day in particular, he was being more of a dick than usual. He threw more shit at me, called me more names, and actually tried to swing a right hook at my head (I dodged it like a badass). I told my coach what had been going on and he told Hunter (faggot's name) that if he kept doing this he would be in trouble. After class, this shitstain thought it would be funny to sneak up behind me in the quad and push me into a big group of people. That was it. I was done. I told my gym teacher that if this fucking faggot kept pushing me around I was going to notify the school police. Hunter got detention, stayed away from me, and I never talked to him again.  TO THIS DAY, I am stronger because of Hunter, his posse, and the countless others like him from different grades and different schools. Today, if anything like this had happened, I would not hesitate to rip someone a new asshole. No one is going to fuck with me like that anymore. No one will, and no one has since 10th grade.  TL;DR This video is too dramatic and the narration is stupid. I got bullied to a breaking point and am stronger now because of it. No one has fucked with me since I decided enough was enough."

Not because the abuse of his peers made him an asshole. No, they made him a man. You appear to have emotional intelligence. So, you can't be a man. Just a girl.

HorriblyDepressing,30ojxm,REVfoREVer,-10,Mon Mar 30 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"Sick burn. I'm glad you're trying to use ""facts"" that are complete guesses on your part. You roasted me like a Christmas ham.  My point with this originally was that people who bully are assholes and you can't stoop to their level and take it like a bitch. Instead, you should do the logical thing and tell an adult/authority what's going on and they'll suffer the consequences.  THIS video, however, makes it seem like there's absolutely no choice in the matter. The way this guy talks about these people implies they didn't think about the most obvious and simplistic action: tell the teacher/principal/dean. If someone does something like call you a name, just tell them to fuck off. If someone does something drastic like beat you up or threaten you with violence, you tell a teacher and their ass gets suspended for being a cuntsmear.  When this guy came along and made such a simplistic statement about my logical argument, I knew there wouldn't be any use in trying to talk to him. There is no teacher to tell.  You, on the other hand, must think you're so fucking smart for making assumptions and talking like you know shit. Kudos, the audience is on your side, so to the readers of this thread it doesn't matter what I say at this point; they think I'm an asshole because I don't have compassion for this stupid video. I was in the same position and chose not to hear shit from some stupid kid who thought he was better than me. That was in 10 grade. 11th and 12th grade, no one talked shit, no one picked on me, in fact, a lot of people thought I was a funny and cool guy."

HorriblyDepressing,30ojxm,I_Miss_Claire,3,Mon Apr 6 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Hunter succeeded in making you a hateful, spiteful person who expects nothing good from the world. I can understand why, but if you want to try and convince people that you overcame what Hunter did to you, then you may want to try a little harder.   My kid is bullied. It isn't constant, but when it happens, she feels bad. She comes home to me and she begs me to home school her. I explain to her that there will be these assholes EVERYWHERE in her life from this moment forward and I cannot protect her her whole life. She has to stay in school and she has to learn how to overcome them. This might sound cruel, but I was bullied too. How I counteracted bullies was with humor. You can't make fun of me if I am already making fun of myself. I eventually learned that what they were saying was mostly true. How can I be mad at the truth?  Complimenting a bully's great observation skills with a smile on your face make them fuck off eventually -- or at least that is how I did it.   She will learn too. I help her as much as I can. I think it is getting better. What I hope with all of my heart is that it doesn't make her bitter like Hunter as made you bitter. I hope she understand that a couple of fools don't define the bunch. I truly hope she learns to know better."

HorriblyDepressing,2zo9iu,pde1029,2,Fri Mar 20 07:43:38 2015 UTC,Did she not move the corpse? Was its mate too protective of it?

From screaming to surprisingly calm and logical. To screaming again. Stomach heaving, it will hurt later on just from the heaving. Knees shake. I take difficult stands on some things.

I was like 5 (6, 7, etc.). But my father did not beat her at all. It was something else. Not to detract from your experience, and I'm really sorry you went through that. How are you today? I'm being honest when I say that I at times wished it was beatings, as they tend to satisfy a clear and identifiable attacker, and lead at least to some conclusion that you can deal with. That's horrible to say and it is in no way meant to be a justification for beating. It is a victim's privilege to say that they wished that, if they did, and I did. There are a lot of reasons I must add that proviso, not the least of which is the bullshit trend in some thinking that we need to get back to beatings. But look at the girl in the OP. She is functioning fairly well. The dysfunction I saw among others in my family and experienced at times myself was so far off the charts as to defy description and healing. Part of that was the open ended structure of it all."

Gender symmetry of article  Domestic violence against men:       The theory that women perpetrate IPV at roughly the same rate as men has been termed ""gender symmetry."" The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by Murray A. Straus and Richard J. Gelles on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 ""intact families."" The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced ""severe"" IPV.   These unexpected results led Suzanne K. Steinmetz to coin the controversial term ""battered husband syndrome"" in 1977.  Ever since the publication of Straus and Gelles' findings, other researchers into domestic violence have disputed whether gender symmetry really exists, in a debate that is still ongoing.

Did this dog have seizures regularly or did anti-depressants alone do this?  You can see the dog dish in the beginning of the second video with the full (I assume Xanax) bars in the dogs food.

Depression and weak points in self confidence do sadly still creep into my life, but I am very happy to say they are at their lowest ever, AND ever decreasing... so Im really glad it came across that I wasnt really bothered by it anymore, but its all a work in progress to be entirely honest...

It'll go from ""I hate fat people, they're X, they act Y, I'm better"", to ""it's impossible to lose this weight"".   And nobody jump up my ass for condoning being overweight, either, it's something that nobody should have to experience, and that everybody should try to correct in themselves if applicable. It's just that people change their tune real quick when it's them."

I know he was very manipulative, But surely there was more they could have done for their daughter, Like getting the police involved, She was 15(I think) when the parents met the boyfriend, Surely they should have got the police involved as she was underage, Instead they allowed her to stay at his house on weekends, And the mother noticed bite marks on her hand and other injuries, Surely she would have thought it necessary to involve the police?

HorriblyDepressing,2xe2e6,thekingswitness,9,Fri Feb 27 20:34:26 2015 UTC,"I had to do this once to my most recent deer. I had shot it from 100ish yards away with my dads M1 Garand, though peep hole sights.  It was a generally clear shot, just some small brush slightly blocking visibility, but I saw the deer mostly.   As I was sitting there in the blind, my dad urgently nudges me, hurriedly pointing towards the deer. They are close, roughly 50 yards away from the blind, half way to the feeder. My dad asks me if I want to take the shot this time, as he had missed the one hours before. I asked if he was sure. ""Sure, you need a chance to get something,"" he exclaimed. I gladly took his rifle. I had only fired it once before this, and was nervous of the sound, as I stupidly left my ear protection back at our camp.   I lay the rifle down on the ledge in front of me, aiming it down range. They rifle wasn't all the way out, just partially. My dad tells me to wait before I take the shot.   During this time, the deer, along with the one it was with, are slowly pacing away from us, along side the treeline to the left. I'm nervous they will go to far out of range for me to shoot accurately at this point.   Eventually, the deer make it to the feeder. After asking, pleading, and begging with my dad to take the shot, he finally lets me. I aim, adrenaline surfing through my body. I see the deer through the sights. My dad tells me to hang on, as I don't have clear visibility. I can see most of the deer, but don't know which side is the head side, as it was grazing it seemed.  My dad tells me to go ahead. I slowly jerk the trigger. I pulled it faster than I would have liked to but I still got the job done.  I hear the explosion of a small canon fire next to me. The deer drops. We wait.  My dad turns to me and congratulates me. ""You fucking got it!"" He exclaimed to me. I'm jittery in excitement, I got one!  We turn, I see the deer jump, but not move forward. My dad and I turn and give each other the goddammit look to each other. We wait for about 10 minutes before we go outside.  We slowly walk out to the beast. I handed my father his rifle and took my .22 lr with me. It is trying to get away, but it can't, it was paralyzed. I took out its lower spinal column, taking out its back legs. It continues make its way to the trees, inch by tiny inch  We approach the once gracefully animal. I know what I have to do. My dad pats it on the shoulder, attempting to sooth it. My dad steps on hits back legs, to keep it from advancing.  I step back and take aim. Hopefully it is a cleaner shot this time. Hopefully I can give the animal the respect of a quick death. I slowly squeeze the trigger. I wasn't jittery anymore, adrenaline had left my previously trembling body.  I hear my rifle fire, and I look up. I hit the damn thing in the neck. It was still alive, yet bleeding and not moving, yet still breathing. I utter a quite ""son of a bitch"" and take aim again.  I fire. The 3rd round went exactly into the temple of the buck, as I had hoped.   We loaded the deer into the bed of the Polaris and process to field gut it, and dismember and skin it at camp with our friend, and host, then take it to the processor.  That was some great meat. Pictures  anyone wants them.  EDIT: I just uploaded the pictures into an album here.NSFW GORE (exit wound, neck and head shot, head cut off with tag) The pictures uploaded in the reverse order of event so the last picture should be the first. The screenshotted ones are the pictures my dad took of me and sent them to my phone so I screenshotted them from textra."

Going with this example, asking someone to help feed yourself or your family may leave you feeling even more vulnerable than before because there's always the possibility that that person will decline to help you. Suffering in silence seems easier than giving someone the option to reject your request for assistance.

Somebody bringing me food would seem to me to say, ""hey, it looks like you need help"", which is pretty much the last thing I want.  If somebody says ""if you need anything let me know"", I can ask them to leave me alone to deal with things my way in my own time.  Maybe it's just a matter of knowing your friends and how they'll react to pain. But when somebody offers help, and you want it, it doesn't seem so hard to say ""I just want somebody to talk to, can you come over/meet me/whatever"".

HorriblyDepressing,2x1bls,theboiledpeanuts,0,Wed Feb 25 20:11:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you are looking at.  If you are referring to solicitors of street prostitutes then absolutely yes, vastly men.  There are many other levels, many are out of the public eye.  Women tend to use more discrete services.  Yes some  will sample the goods at a strip club-just like men-but there are plenty of others who use escort-type services or guises like poolboys/houseboys/girls/maids etc.  There is a larger portion of women (then males) that use it more for companionship and not just straight sexual gratification.  'Dates' tend not to be limited to an hour, many include public appearances where they may be introduced as grandchildren/niece/nephews etc.  there are some (talking adult here) escorts that will claim to be relationship counselors or life coaches etc. --Please note there are real Life Coaches and Relationship Counselors who are educated, licensed and don't sleep with their clients.  I am not talking about them. Yes, men are still they main solicitors but women are out there in larger numbers then most are aware.  Many stick to one or two preferred purveyor.  If you are looking at those who profit off of selling others the numbers-in my opinion-are closer to 50/50.  Women also partake more often as part of a couple. When looking at those specifically going after the under 18 worker- women can often hide under the guise of child care for the 0-10 crowd and as educators or victims themselves (the good old- overly horny teen just wouldn't take no for an answer)."
HorriblyDepressing,2x1bls,iddco,19,Sun Mar 8 23:50:52 2015 UTC,"My husband just got back from Thailand. So many of his co-workers exploited the sex industry without knowing or caring about the well being of the people they involve. I think about it a lot day to day, and it just breaks my heart that nobody cares. That we treat these people's bodies as a resource. The sex trafficking in Thailand isn't ""okay"" because it is legal in the country. It's just more exploited by the government. And that is heartbreaking. We can't even control our military enough to stop them from supporting and exploiting the many countries we send them to."

In the first picture it's sunny, there's kids playing in the background and his friends are wearing ties while the 3 guy is not.   In the second shot it's no longer sunny. There aren't any kids playing. Kid number 3 is now wearing a tie to symbolise his two lost friends who wore ties.   It takes an already depressing situation and matches the surroundings with their feelings  Edit: Something I missed. Kid 3 is now wearing a different sweater, the same style as his two dead friends."
HorriblyDepressing,2vxl73,TheHumbleSailor,-11,Sun Feb 15 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like is that it looks like they are smiling [more] in the second picture. I think the impact would be greater if their expressions were much more solemn. It would more closely show the shattering of the lighthearted innocence that they would never be able to fully return to after an event like that. Like everything else in the picture, it would help show how times have changed and that the world is more grim now. That things will never be the same again.  The slight smiles kind of ruin the impact of it for me and may even come off a little disrespectful. I guess you could say it represents either their good memories of their lost friends, or that they are still able to find peace/happiness in a time of such adversity, but I still think solemn faces would have suited it better."

HorriblyDepressing,2usgjx,idespisetheinternet,-12,Thu Feb 12 22:47:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my point exactly.... this is a woman who is willing to objectify herself like a blue ribbon at a fair for someone to win. She has no real quality selling point, other than the fortunate circumstance that she is a single woman in China."
HorriblyDepressing,2usgjx,idespisetheinternet,8,Thu Feb 5 00:29:45 2015 UTC,What'd your point again?
HorriblyDepressing,2usgjx,Jihad_Shark,-3,Thu Feb 5 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"Because there are now more men than women in China it is a lot harder to find a wife, making single women more valuable. This woman knows that and takes advantage of it. I can't make this anymore simple."
HorriblyDepressing,2usgjx,idespisetheinternet,7,Thu Feb 5 07:39:27 2015 UTC,She's not taking advantage of that situation at all. It just makes it somewhat easier to find a suitor.  Are you suggesting that in a more gender equal country she wouldn't?  Holy shit dude you have a really stupid way of thinking. She's not even getting anything really positive out of this. The gender inequality just slightly helps out her situation.
HorriblyDepressing,2usgjx,Jihad_Shark,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:58:01 2015 UTC,"I think his point is that this seems weird to people in other countries. I live in the US and I can't imagine a woman (or man) offering their marriage for any sort of help or favor. It is just something I have never heard of before. Probably because the amount of men and women are roughly equal and most people will have no trouble finding someone to marry them.   I don't think he is accusing or criticizing the woman in any way. If anything he is criticizing Chinese men who might consider marriage to a woman something that would be indirectly paid for because they are so hard to come buy. Any man who accepts her offer out of anything other than a legitimate desire to help her brother is basically saying that he is willing to purchase her as a wife, which I think you must admit is a bit fucked up."

HorriblyDepressing,2ugnif,caz0,2,Tue Feb 17 21:33:30 2015 UTC,"Found this on straight dope:  From Gliding flight: speed and acceleration of ideal falcons during diving and pull out (http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/201/3/403):  Some falcons, such as peregrines (Falco peregrinus), attack their prey in the air at the end of high-speed dives and are thought to be the fastest of animals. Estimates of their top speed in a dive range up to 157 m s-1, although speeds this high have never been accurately measured. This study investigates the aerodynamic and gravitational forces on 'ideal falcons' and uses a mathematical model to calculate speed and acceleration during diving. Ideal falcons have body masses of 0.5-2.0 kg and morphological and aerodynamic properties based on those measured for real falcons. The top speeds reached during a dive depend on the mass of the bird and the angle and duration of the dive. Given enough time, ideal falcons can reach top speeds of 89-112 m s-1 in a vertical dive, the higher speed for the heaviest bird, when the parasite drag coefficient has a value of 0.18. This value was measured for low-speed flight, and it could plausibly decline to 0.07 at high speeds. Top speeds then would be 138-174 m s-1.  Assuming the 157ms-1 figure is accurate, that comes out to ~351mph. A mathematically-ideal falcon could achieve even higher speeds.  This is all based on modelling and estimates, of course, since no-one has ever actually recorded a falcon diving in excess of 300mph. But it does seem plausible, and more importantly, survivable.   a kiwi has a much lower terminal velocity then a falcon. So I believe it would be able to survive the fall."

I mean, yeah, they're terrible and sad, but it doesn't hit me as hard as seeing someone grieve the loss of a human loved one.  This picture, though.  The look on that man's face is so heartbreaking I teared up.  That dog was family to him and now it's gone."
HorriblyDepressing,2ubvrr,kabneenan,10,Sat Jan 31 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"Do you mean to say that the deaths of your pets don't affect you as much, or the deaths of animals in general, or the deaths of the pets of those you know?   I've worked in animal care my whole life and I've seen a lot of animals go down- I don't have the emotional capacity to mourn each and every one. It's not heartless, it's practicality. But sometimes there are animals that really get you.   When I found out I wasn't going to be taking my cat Moondog home from the vet, I started crying instantly. Quietly, until he was gone, because I didn't want to distress him. I kept crying quietly for about 5-10 more minutes, then I left the room and the office and went to the car and let my brother finish the appointment. Then as I was driving home, I cried more openly. By the time I got to the shower, I was on my knees, weeping and mourning so loudly the neighbors could probably hear. I cried until I went to bed that night, many many hours later. I had a closer bond with that cat more than I had with any other human being in my life- seriously.   This dog was special to that man. And much like people, not every animal is loved by someone. Not every animal is mourned. But sometimes they are, and that's when it hurts. Maybe one day you'll have that, maybe not. But the only reason this photo is so painful to see is because it encapsulates the grief of losing a pure, and sometimes only friend."

Reasonably I know that many people are very close to their pets, even more so than their friends and family.  I can see that in this image and that's why it affected me more than similar instances, which is why I prefaced my post by describing how normally seeing someone grieve their pet doesn't hit me as hard.  I am sorry for your loss, by the way.  I may not be able to empathize, but I can sympathize."

As it so happens when you give away say two of those lobes (I'm hazy on the exact details, don't quote me here) both halves can become bigger and get to almost full efficiency, but they can't develop new lobes. You're just left with two separate halves of one organ that can both do the job fine. Of these lobes, only two are big enough to fulfill their task, so halves is as much as you can break it down. Both people will remain with only two lobes for their whole lives.  An easier way to think of it is being like kidneys, just they're stuck together. You can and will do just fine with one, but once you've given one away, one is all you'll have -- it won't grow back to make two."

I'm not shaming anyone who has resorted to suicide of course, but I feel maybe I could go through an eternity of misery before I could ever do this to someone.

What he did was the ultimate act of selfishness, and the fact that he did it in the home where his siblings would find him, shows that he didn't give a shit about their wellbeing. He just didn't think about them or care because he felt his problems were more important. Well now it's everyone else's problem and it will be for decades to come.   There are people enduring far worse than this guy's mental problems, but they manage not to kill themselves in a grisly way where children will find them.   You don't know that nobody tried to help him. You know nothing about this case whatsoever besides what you heard on the 911 call. You just assume that nobody tried to help because you're romanticizing suicide.

You can't look at any other women, or else you get a different kind of gut-wrenching feeling when she's not there, or get the third degree when she is there. Her problems become your problems.

HorriblyDepressing,2t0t7e,PhilMcCrevices,0,Tue Jan 20 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"No, YOU fuck off.  If I had a choice between lifelong loneliness (my current state) and having to deal with the trauma of rape but otherwise being normal, I would choose the latter. Rape trauma is something that can be overcome, as evidence by all those people who have overcome the trauma of having been victims of rape. Lifelong loneliness is not something you overcome. You just die alone, never having experienced... well, anything.  So seriously, go fuck yourself. It's hard enough dealing with the loneliness, the inadequacy and the sexual frustration without random self-entitled assholes like you going out of their way to tell me (and others!) I'm not in pain when I am, in fact, in pain."
HorriblyDepressing,2t0t7e,Carkudo,-2,Thu Jan 22 04:57:42 2015 UTC,"I will never be able to wrap my head around someone that say they'd rather be raped than be lonely.  I'm not trying to be mean but I really think that type of thinking is a reason you may not be attractive to others.  I understand you are lonely, but loneliness, as much as you may think otherwise, is completely rectifiable.  Rape, and the ensuing trauma, is not."
HorriblyDepressing,2t0t7e,riccarjo,7,Tue Jan 20 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"If my loneliness were rectifiable, I'd be out there rectifying it. Unfortunately, at 30 years old, after tons of attempts, I'm pretty damn sure this shit is for life. Can you imagine living your whole life alone? Growing old alone? Taking care of your aging parents, and your aging self, always alone? This isn't about having nobody to go clubbing with on a Friday night. This is about slowly becoming completely isolated from the world because everyone has a fucking family and is too busy to hang out, and even if they aren't, you don't have much in common anymore, because everyone has a fucking family and you're just always alone.  So yes, I would take having to deal with severe trauma but living an otherwise normal life over this. But you don't care, do you? Nobody ever does. Normal people don't have to deal with lifelong loneliness and it's completely acceptable to just trivialize it and say it's not a problem. It's easy to say ""I'd have no problem living like that"" when you know you'll never have to actually live it. Do you think people lke you telling me I'm not suffering eases the suffering or something? Nah. You're probably just dead set on dismissing the issue of loneliness altogether.  Oh, and rape? I'm not going to trivialize the horror of rape (the way you're treating my own issue of loneliness), but there's plenty of evidence that it's possible to live a fulfilling life after surviving rape. As evidenced by people who live a fulfilling life after surviving rape. THAT is why I would take that trauma over my current loneliness. It has hope. My isolation is hopeless."

Cops also have the power and apparently right to kill other humans.  The fact that oftentimes the police are not questioned heavily for WHY they felt necessary to shoot someone is the main reason the police have the shitty reputation they have.  Reputation is earned, not given.   The police have earned it...even if it was through basic human emotions like fear and panic.  If the courts would have investigated cases as they arose instead of just accepting the office had to kill someone then the public would not be so against them.  As it is, to a layman, the Police are an elevated class with the power of life and death over the rest of us.  They are Samurai and we are peasants.  That they killed us is enough justification that we must have deserved it.  Until that is rectified the police will continue to hold a horrid reputation for murder, even if many of them are polite, kind, and decent human beings.   The fact that we don't question them is the problem."

HorriblyDepressing,2s1j9g,Kaleon,3,Wed Jan 28 09:41:09 2015 UTC,Everybody!  This is 4chan!  You would be a fool to take anything posted there as fact.  It is just a creative work of fiction...  But that doesn't explain why I'm sniffing now.
HorriblyDepressing,2s1j9g,pieisablessing2me,10,Mon Jan 12 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"Why does the factual state of a piece matter? It is something I do legitimately wonder, as a good story doesn't need to be true. Rather, it just has to stir up emotions within us. To pluck upon our feelings with great care, like an old man playing a song on his ageing acoustic guitar. The story of John Coffey on the Green Mile doesn't have to be true to make me weep, so why do stories on 4chan have to be true?"

HorriblyDepressing,2s1j9g,tanbu,-2,Wed Jan 14 08:21:28 2015 UTC,"No, it's just good films and good books can create a suspension of disbelief, and so I feel moved by the events in the fiction. Here, it's just another ""hey 4chan I played vidya with some random guy and then he died probably its sad :("" copypasta from 4chan. The writing is terrible.  Also, with a good piece of fiction, I'm not always aware of what the creator wants me to feel. This thing is almost screaming ""THIS PART IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE U FEEL"" at you. The Syrian/Iraqi TF2 copypasta is much better (but obviously still not that sad)."

HorriblyDepressing,2rsgt0,claireballoon,2,Fri Jan 9 06:30:18 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I meant to say that I heard the song originally from the series.   The bittersweet aspect of the film is IMO one of the beautiful things about it. The main character's grief and growth is something most of us can relate to. I agree that the song is incredibly depressing and when you watch the AMV that the song is paired with, the feeling intensifies."
HorriblyDepressing,2rsgt0,CommanderCooper,2,Sat Jan 10 21:27:11 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqFftJDXii0  Watch this. The emotion in his face is incredible. The film is one of my favorites that I've ever watched... I often listen to the piano soundtrack while studying, too. It has stuck with me for many many years. However, I have a hard time saying that the film is depressing. Spoiler: In the beginning, all they want is to see the cherry blossoms fall together again someday. Many years later, they do watch them fall at the same set of train tracks, together, although she is unaware. So, bittersweet, but not depressing (in my opinion!)."
HorriblyDepressing,2rsgt0,iStabCows,1 point,Sat Jan 10 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"Jesus that video is raw. I agree with you that the film is also not depressing in that aspect! It's just the entire with the context and struggles the main character were going through is what I am currently relating with the right now. However the ending scene is what I would say is the ""lifter"" or metaphor of finally accepting and moving on. I guess I just wanted to share this video primarily because the heartbreak is what's horribly depressing but not the movie as a whole. The experience is indeed bittersweet."

I like to think it makes people think more about adopting an animal rather than going out and paying for a pricey show dog.  31 years of time and space and many adopted dogs later, I can honestly say they love you more.  It's like they know they were left behind once and knowing that someone chose them after that makes them far more affectionate and loving.    Here's to Kai and every dog sleeping in a shelter or kennel tonight.  May they all find their forever homes."

I used to write down a million things: stories, songs, poems, thoughts, and then hide them, tuck them away in some drawer or bin - never let them see the light of day again. All because I thought nobody would care about what I had to say, to write, to sing.  I think Reddit helped me get over that, though. Hiding behind the veil of pseudo-anonymity, I can tell the world a thousand stories and the worst that can happen is nobody listens.  It's so nice writing things and having them be read, even if by only a few wandering eyes. It makes me feel like the world is actually listening sometimes, like the world cares about what I say.

I also think it's wrong to call mental ill people selfish (although conversely the thought of causing my loved ones pain is the only reason I'm still here so far - I guilt myself into living I guess?) That's beside the point. What I wanted to say please don't make someone else take your life. You really can't tell what effect it would have on them, knowing that ultimately they killed you. Maybe they wouldn't give a shit, but more likely they would. Also you fuck up a LOT of people's day, including the people who have to pick up every single scrap of you off the tracks. Nasty.   The ever-helpful Daily Mail ran an article recently about a girl who lay across the tracks to die but somehow flinched and ended up with only her legs across the track, her body in between. She lost both her legs which made her life a billion times more shitty than before. So, nothing's guaranteed I guess?! /s  Standard reminder that you shouldn't kill yourself (neither should I) go check out the anti suicide sub, you are loved etc etc. No seriously, keep going dude.

I'm gathering that he wanted to jump in front of a train and said that it isn't greedy because he's mentally ill. I disagree, but despite that, he doesn't deserve to die. If he isn't mentally ill, there's absolutely nothing to lose with playing it safe. If he is, asking him to die could very well kill him.  I get it, you probably didn't mean any malice. I've felt the same way sometimes, and I think many of the ""self-diagnosed"" people do just want attention. I think they trivialize the issue.  I was self-diagnosed. I was afraid of getting labeled as crazy or treated differently, and I never sought help. Every day for four months, when I got up, I had to consciously decide to not die that day. One day, I decided that was it, and later that day, I tried. It was really a matter of sheer chance it didn't work.  I know that went off-course a bit, but I'm just trying to emphasize, please don't just dismiss someone because you think they're self-diagnosed or want attention, and please don't advocate for anyone's death, jokingly or otherwise. Please play it safe; they could be one of the people that needs the most help.  EDIT: for clarity"

Finally, the one weekend where I told him I wasn't going to come over, he died in his sleep.

HorriblyDepressing,2q443o,DietVicodin,16,Tue Dec 23 02:54:25 2014 UTC,"Wow, that really hit home with me.  I'm sorry for your loss.  :(  On my birthday this year, I got a call from my mom.  As per usual, I just ignored it, and then listened to the voicemail afterwards.  I think it'd been a couple of years since I talked to her, for no real reason other than she wasn't a very good mother and as an adult I feel that I didn't need to maintain that relationship any longer.  I chose to not know her.  She was drunk, which is par for her, and she sounded terrible.  She held the phone to the stereo and played some Elton John, just like she does every year, and then told me she loves me and missed hearing the sound of her first born's voice.  A few days later, I got a call from my sister, who I haven't spoken more than 20 words to in the past 15 years.  I didn't recognize the number so I didn't pick up, but I listened to the voicemail.  It said she flew back home to California to be with Mom who probably wasn't going to survive the night, that she had OD'd on a combo of things, was in septic shock, and she thought I might like to know.  I didn't know how to process that info.  So, I didn't.  I did end up having a brief breakdown at work in front of my boss, saying I might bolt out of town unexpectedly if I decide to stop being a jerk son, but that I couldn't decide if I wanted to.  I get a call from my dad, as he knows I likely wasn't going to respond to my sister... and he explains more of what happened, all this being relayed to him by my sister.  They divorced when I was 4, so my dad raised me and my sister by himself, and I admire the man greatly.  He told me he understands why I wouldn't want to go see Mom, and knows it's probably tough to process.  Turns out Mom was touch and go for about a week, and ended up turning somewhat psychotic.  They had to tie her down and restrain her so she wouldn't hurt the doctors.  Apparently it got so bad that my sister finally decided to just leave for good... and I don't know if my mom is alive or dead right now.  Either way, I haven't heard anything from her since my birthday, so I'm assuming she's dead.  And then there's my dad.  I adore the man.  We used to work together, and he'd come up and have lunch in my office with me.  There's also my grandma, who was sort of like my mother figure.  She'd come watch us while my dad worked his various second jobs during his 20's and 30's just to keep us clothed and fed.  I talk to my dad maybe once a year now.  We email a couple times a year with brief updates, same thing with my grandma.  Well, after the mom stuff went down, I wrote my dad a very open and genuine email telling him that I'm not in such a good place.  That I was drinking to excess, would hole myself up, wouldn't push myself to make new friends or relationships... and I got a disappointing, chastising email back from him which made me feel like I needed to become even more of a recluse.  Which is odd, as I'm a confident guy when out and about, but I just can't bear to let myself get close to another for whatever reason.  Shortly after the email that made me feel shitty, I got another one apologizing... with him saying I could tell him anything.  But I don't feel like I can now because I know it'll just upset him.  My grandma sent me a check last month and a handwritten letter telling me that grandpa is bedridden.  But that they think of me a lot and hope I'm doing well.  I haven't cashed the check or responded.  Same thing with my dad... sent me a check for Christmas and I can't bring myself to cash it.  I assume I'll get a ""Merry Christmas, Dan"" text from him tomorrow.  He knows to keep it brief with me, because I think he's scared of pushing me away.  And when Grandpa dies... I don't know how to bring myself to go to the funeral, but I know I will need to, as they were the closest family I had.  But there will be more family there, people I didn't say goodbye to when I loaded my car up and left California five years ago.  Will they judge me?  It's okay if they do, as I deserve it.  And what about when my dad dies?  The guy is genuine.  He's married and divorced several times, has a 10 year old daughter from his last marriage.  But I know it'll need to be my sister and me who come home to bury him... and I just don't know how I'd be able to do it.  I have managed to completely alienate myself from my family, I don't know how or why I do this.  My entire family thought I'd be the guy with the perfect life, graduated from college, married, kids... but I often feel I don't deserve those things... and so I sit here, and I drink until I blackout.  Errrr... I don't know where I was going with all that, but thank you for letting me type that.  My thoughts are with you, stranger."

Grandpa died a week ago last Monday.  Again, it was my sister who texted me to let me know.  It took only 11 minutes from her telling me he probably wasn't going to make it, to her simply saying, ""He's gone.""  I didn't get the message until an hour after it happened.  A few hours later, a text from Dad came letting me know the same news.  I did not know how to process or react to it... but considering that I was ridiculously closer to my grandparents, and thinking about Grandma losing her lifelong partner and whatever sadness and feeling of loss she was feeling had to be substantial, and my Dad losing his own father... I was faced with deciding to head to Colorado to show face and pay respects and to be there for family.  It took me only a day to decide to go.  And I'm terrified.  Anxious.  But hopeful that it'll go well.  Looking forward to hugging Grandma and Dad.  And maybe my sister.  Two days later, last Wednesday, it was my birthday.  No phonecall came from my mom, the first time it's ever not happened.  I still don't know if she's alive or dead.  So I got everything booked... a flight, car, hotel.  Cost a pretty penny, and the service isn't until next week.  It's delayed, so it gives people time to get out there.  My dad, sister and grandma all offered to fully pay for me going back out there, but I feel so guilty having been distant from them for so many years that I told them no, I'd only do it on my dime.   And then my car decides it's going to die.  Like, not in a good way.  It's consistently been shutting off while driving, and spitting out all sorts of electrical error codes.  I try to find a mechanic that'll service it, as it's a model notorious for being a costly car to have repaired and some folks won't even work on it, and the guy closest to me says he can't get to it for a week.  So I call around, find a place, reserve a rental car, and I go in today to drop it off.  He runs his initial diagnostics and says just to get it running again will be at least $1K, and once it's running he'll be able to diagnose and recommend what else needs to be done.  It's my own damn fault, though... it was a Craigslist buy on a deal that sounded almost too good to be true.  Shuts off while driving, idle's rough, coolant is leaking, driver's side door jams.  But, whatever.  I'm realizing I'll probably be wiping out my savings if I opt to get the car fully repaired, mixed with this trip back west.  So I go to get my rental car... and the agent tells me that no, no I cannot pick up the rental car.  They do a soft credit check since I paid with a debit card, and it comes up saying I am not able to be rented to.  I did declare bankruptcy last year, so maybe that had something to do with it... but he says he can still rent to me so long as I give him a credit card.  I do not have any credit cards.  I haven't had a credit card in years.  And then I realize... next week, when I fly to Colorado, I will also be denied my car rental there, and panic sets in.  I really, really do not want to rely on anybody else, or beg for a ride from the airport, to a hotel that I've reserved that isn't actually located in the city where my Grandma lives because I was drunk when I booked it and mixed up the name with another city.  So, I cave.  I text my sister.  We haven't talked or connected or bonded since the both of us became adults over ten years ago.  But I suck it up, and tell her I'm in need of some assistance.  I tell her what situation I'm in, and that if she is able to, if she could come to the airport, get me, then rent a car on which I'll be listed as the second driver, with me paying of course... and somehow, she comes up with a solution that's even better.  She's sending me a credit card in my name that'll be linked to her account so they'll bypass the credit check.  Just... man.  Life is wonky sometimes.  I'm feeling more anxious about Grandpa passing than I am about Mom, but thinking about Mom passing tugged at me more as I actively pushed myself away from her and all she wanted was her son.  Grandpa, we all knew he was in bad shape for years.  But the logistics of it all and timing of car issues... just kind of sucks.  I feel like I'm doing lots of juggling, and am keeping an eye on my finances.  I've got it all covered financially, but it's making a sizable dent in whatever cash I had on hand.  But alas, that's why I save instead of spend, I suppose.  I'm alright.  On beer 3, and am spending the night in.  Things are okay here."

It's hard for people to understand a situation like this when they haven't been in one themselves. My sister died of a heroin overdose and for the months preceding it, I didn't talk to her. I tried to help her repeatedly over the years even when she was abusive to me and stole from me. I got to a point where I couldn't deal with it. I wish I had talked to her before it happened, but I've learned to deal with it. It is unfortunate that I missed my chance to talk to her one last time, but there were reasons why things happened the way they did.

At first I couldn't bear to open his message thread, even while he was still alive because it just made me feel so sad inside. When I finally did, my heart broke even deeper, it was a feeling I've never really felt before, especially as someone with depression who feels mostly numb all the time. I guess posting it here has provided some kind of strange comfort. You are really are a wonderful and supportive community, I cannot begin to express how much I appreciate all the kind posts and messages.      To those of you dealing with the addicts in your family, understand that they can be extremely selfish and near impossible to deal with. But don't forget the person underneath. Try to understand who they are with an objective view point. What have they been through and what made them turn to drugs? Who were they before? While you don't necessarily have to let yourself close to them, let them know you understand.      I luckily didn't have a father who was abusive in any way, just into his own life and neglectful. I just wish I could have told my dad I understand him because I am like him, fighting depression and desperately trying to overcome addictive tendencies. I wish he could have known that I saw his pain and I saw who he truly was deep down, I feel I could have made the world a less lonely place for him..."

I grew up without much of a connection to my father. When I was younger we would go fishing together every now and then. When I was about 5 we got into a bad car wreck that left him disabled. Since then he started smoking pot all the time and completely blowing me off. I grew up as an angsty little brat who hated his parents because they never pampered me. But they were there. He was there during the summers when I was home from school. We would talk and watch old reruns of Bonanza and The Rifleman. Still didn't feel close to him. Few years ago he had a heart attack. He went in for a checkup and he started right in the waiting room. Scariest moment of my life when I found out. I had so much guilt, I didn't have to rely on him to spend time with me, I needed to make the incentive to ask him out to go eat, walk around the park, or just sit at home and watch TV. You can think you have no attachment to them, but don't wait to find out otherwise when it is too late my friend. Love your parents, no matter how much they did or did not love you. Still your folks."

My father took me hunting a few times and we watched TV together but I was the same with you I had to make the incentive to do anything with him. Then he had a heart attack and I almost had a nervous breakdown because I was so upset. Such a shame he still treats me like he did before. I wish I could have a normal relationship with him but it's too late for that, unfortunately, the way he treated me still gives me problems today. I just can't deal with him."

I am back home for winter break now, but I leave to go back in a week. I'm looking forward to this semester being over with as soon as possible so I can take online classes and move back to my hometown so I can be near my folks.

HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,jaxaj,2,Thu Dec 11 16:00:04 2014 UTC,"I was thinking that, but I think the reason she asks how he did it is because if he'd done something like start a fire or use gas, it could be harmful to other people and they'd have to know that."
HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,jaxaj,-18,Thu Dec 11 16:40:10 2014 UTC,"There's something I don't get, why was the operator asking all these stupid questions? To be exact these questions were completely redundant and in my opinion making the situation even worse; ""What's your name?"", ""How did he do it?"", ""Did you just find him Nicky?"", the last bloody thing that girl wants to do is answer some goddamn questions and all of them can be answered once cops and medics arrive on the scene! Her mind is wrecked and poking her with these questions will frustrate, annoy and infuriate her.   Also I think once she asked these questions and there were no more 'necessary' questions to ask, she could handle the situation better by talking to her differently, but this one might be due how freakish this scenario was, but the first part was loaded with so many unnecessary questions that in my opinion made the situation just worse.  Maybe my perception of the situation is warped, but that's how I see it, maybe someone could correct me?"
HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,I_Think_Alot,21,Thu Dec 11 21:34:16 2014 UTC,"She has to keep her engaged until help arrives, you cant just leave someone, let alone a kid, to go just like that."
HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,jaxaj,-13,Thu Dec 11 01:30:50 2014 UTC,"No, of course not, my problem was her asking that girl questions. Last thing you want to do with someone that is emotionally wrecked is to ask them questions, they are going through their personal hell, trying to think of all the things that are possibly related to the scenario, and by trying to redirect their thoughts to answer questions annoys and infuriates them. The better way to deal with situations like this where questions CAN wait is to comfort the caller, just talk to them and try to slightly veer their thoughts from the situation at hand, but definitely not ask questions that are not needed because they DON'T want to answer questions, they just want to vent, get help asap and cry.  That is of course unless my model of human behaviour is warped once again, I'm talking purely from experience.  Imagine following situation; You're calling your friend that you always talk and you find out that their parent they were close to died, are you going to question them? Asking them how they died? Whether it was painful? Whether it was suicide or murder or accident? If not, then what would you say?"
HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,slapadastic,21,Thu Dec 11 01:53:08 2014 UTC,"Without sounding like too much of a dick... emergency operators receive a lot of training. Asking questions is obviously what they've been trained to do: it keeps the caller engaged and on the phone until help can arrive.  While I'm sure your experience is valid, these people are professionals and they know what they're doing. They know how to do their job better than you know how to do their job."
HorriblyDepressing,2owqmo,ShiaTheBeouf,-12,Thu Dec 11 02:04:58 2014 UTC,"Without sounding too much of a dick, we both know as much what an operator's job is like. It's not like every call comes from a 10 yo girl that found her dead brother, there's a reason why this particular call reached the sub, because it's exceptionally freaky, even if the operator had training it is possible that in heat of the moment they panicked, that's not out of equation. Plus I also remember a story from an operator how he was moved to different area and did not receive any additional training because they assumed that since he worked elsewhere he didn't need any and almost screwed up, and the incompetence of his superiors angered him, so there's that. Also their training is going to cover so much, I doubt they do extensive courses on human psychology and such, sometimes cut-out formulas don't apply to ALL situations.   However, keeping them engaged is good, asking questions is not, the more plausible situation here is that the operator was trying to assess the situation to make sure the dispatchers are not in any risk, and making sure dispatchers are safe is more important than frustrating a borderline-mentally broken 10 yo one way or another."

As much as I love something to get worked up about, people are jerks sometimes, on the internet as elsewhere. It's not a romantic notion to rally behind, but just a plain fact. The video comes across as trying to make poetic a sentiment that is as common and straightforward as ""sometimes it rains,"" and ultimately succeeds less due to the strained effort to attach something genuinely beautiful--Nordic folklore--to something mundane and everyday, an unoriginal effort that has never been undertaken successfully.  The only thing depressing about it is that it exists."

HorriblyDepressing,2n5me1,Forresterc,2,Thu Nov 27 09:54:02 2014 UTC,This guy should probably know that the term troll comes from trolling for arguments. Trolling is the verb for a form of fishing wherein you cast out many lines in an attempt to get as many fish as possible.  It is not named after the nordic folklore of trolls.

This is the case of my great-grandmother who is 96 and has had about 6 kinds of cancer. We visit her at least weekly and others in the family do too.   While this may not be the case for all, it's not always depressing. Volunteer at your local nursing home if you can, it's really great to just go talk to some of the residents or hold activities for them. I personally trim, file, and paint nails for some of the residents and listen to the gossip around the place :)"

I feel this little guy got addicted to that feeling of flying and became dependent on those nuggets for the experience. It's very honest to what it is like, not just drugs but any nasty addiction. Doesn't realize how much it is hurting him by ignoring his own health as the screen gets darker andit begins to lose its effect"

HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,Renner1,2,Sun Mar 22 11:47:10 2015 UTC,"What the fuck kind of nonsense are you even spouting?   It's kind of hard to deny that ""rape hysteria"" doesn't exist when you have specific groups pushing the ""rape culture"" and ""every man (on campus) is a potential rapist"" concepts and narratives as some kind of verifiable fact that should be mainstream.   Are you suggesting sexual assault isn't a widespread problem on college campuses? Did you even read the article?    I'm suggesting that there is no ""rape crisis"" or ""rape epidemic"" and that people should try to be level headed about the whole thing instead of taking the ""proud sluts and third wave feminists"" approach to rape as a crime/phenomena and sexual interactions in general, because both are utterly, absolutely unhelpful."
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,Renner1,4,Thu Nov 20 03:24:05 2014 UTC,Where in the article did it advocate for any of that? You're projecting your own agenda all over this story.
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,DoctorforProphet,-4,Thu Nov 20 03:27:57 2014 UTC,"What agenda are you talking about? I don't have an agenda beyond ""saying that there's a massive rape crisis and endorsing specific feminist terminology rooted in rhetoric is stupid and won't actually solve anything""."
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,Renner1,1 point,Thu Nov 20 03:31:22 2014 UTC,"...that's exactly the agenda I'm talking about. The article didn't endorse any terminology or theory. I don't think you actually read the article at all, or you just got to the point where the author mentions the existence of slut walks and decided that merely referring to them is an endorsement of them."
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,DoctorforProphet,-8,Thu Nov 20 03:40:38 2014 UTC,"The article is sympathetic to the narrative of ""it's so hard for women to report rape because everyone's out to get them"" and seems to endorse the idea of a ""rape epidemic"" on college and university campuses.  I admit I stopped reading after that, but also because I have a lot less respect for the RS then I had previously. Because of other issues then the one in question, mind you."
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,Renner1,5,Thu Nov 20 03:42:59 2014 UTC,"So upon not reading most of the article, you felt you understood the story well enough to conclude it wasn't difficult to report a sexual assault, there is in fact no pressure put upon victims to avoid pressing charges, and those who commit sexual assault are properly punished?"
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,DoctorforProphet,-6,Thu Nov 20 03:56:36 2014 UTC,"you felt you understood the story well enough to conclude it wasn't difficult to report a sexual assault   I didn't conclude that. For what it's worth, people should take into account that when people use ""it's so difficult for these women to press charges"" it's not ""obviously"" because the authorities set out to accuse them of lying or act hostile towards them.    and there is in fact no pressure put upon victims to avoid pressing charges?    I find that this is one of those claims that can be inundated with hyperbole very quickly."
HorriblyDepressing,2mt9nk,Renner1,8,Thu Nov 20 04:00:05 2014 UTC,"If you had made it past the first few paragraphs, you may have found exactly why and how the school and students there made it difficult to report the sexual assault, and it takes great care to give an objective view of the attitudes of the various players involved.

Her circumstances are prominently recorded in the annals of abnormal child psychology.   When she was a baby her father decided that she was severely mentally retarded, causing him to dislike her and withhold his care and attention. At the age of 20 months Genie's father decided to isolate Genie as much as possible, so from the age of 20 months to 13 years, 7 months, he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time he almost always strapped her to a child's toilet or bound her in a crib with her arms and legs completely immobilized, and left her severely malnourished.    During this time she was never exposed to any significant amount of speech, and as a result she did not acquire language during childhood. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970.

I'm 24 now, and even though I'm medicated and decently happy, I still always think about suicide. It's no longer a melancholy numb resort, but a casual thought. I think about who I'd give my remaining money to and how I'd tell them it wasn't their fault.   When things get hard and I'm really stressed out and don't think I can do it, I think about how I could always kill myself if I don't make it, and that makes me feel a lot better and makes me not worry so much.

I have no idea what it feels like to lose or even have a kid so I have no right to judge her actions. I feel pretty bad :(

Take your time grieving. Remember the good times you spent with him and take comfort in knowing that you did the best thing for him everyday, especially in the end.  I have pets that I've lost years and years ago that I still grieve for today. I loved them more than I can describe with words and that love has made me a better person."

HorriblyDepressing,2kohsp,raven457,4,Wed Oct 29 21:46:20 2014 UTC,"My heart aches for you, OP. My wife and I feel your pain, and know exactly what you are feeling  Today is National Cat Day, but it is also the one year anniversary of the loss of our little girl, Onyx. On top of that, Four, a younger, friendlier member of our little feral colony, drug himself home on Saturday with a shattered pelvis after being hit by a car, and we had to take him to the vet to be given what we sadly refer to as ""the big sleep"". :(  Onyx was the first cat we owned together, a rescue from a shelter, quirky as all get out, and as spoiled and loved as a cat could be. We put up a fight against renal failure with medication, sub-dermal fluid injections, and special diets, but ultimately her liver started to shut down too, and we had to make the decision we knew needed to be made. We wept like children as we signed the paperwork that day, and we wept again on Saturday. I'm weeping again as I type this.  I like to think that Comet, and Onyx, and Four, are all together, somewhere, wherever animals go when they leave us, and they are telling each other about how much their people loved them.   The loss never goes away, but it does get a bit easier to deal with after enough time has gone by. Hang in there, ok?"

From the sounds of it, he knew how special he was to you.  You did the right thing.  Our animal friends can't always articulate the pain and suffering they deal with from illness so it's left to our best inferences to realize when it's time, and it sounds like it was the right time for Comet to go - with dignity, and by the side of someone he knew loved him.  Like the loss of any loved one, it heals little by little over time, but rest assured that you gave Comet a life he may not have otherwise had, and gave him all the love and care our furry little friends deserve."

HorriblyDepressing,2k12bg,ryantula,30,Thu Oct 23 04:46:16 2014 UTC,"For anyone who hasn't been in the situation of a family member dying, and you being there for it, let me tell you about it. Here's a story.   I graduated highschool and was about to join the military after my family moved away during my senior year and I stayed where I was with no family. I had a small apartment for about a month til my long term friend's family happily took me in.  After moving in they kicked my friend out because he was doing nothing but getting into trouble with other friends and they were tired of him wasting money. I stayed with the family and younger brother, who I became close friends with and ended up hanging out with a lot - keeping each other motivated.   After some time I realized the military wasn't for me and let them know I wasn't joining anymore. They understood and asked me to stay a bit longer and so I did until I told them I was leaving two weeks later to go home and try to prepare myself for college.  In that month the mother opened up a small business, as did the father. The son and I helped set everything up with the mother who began having drinking problems. She saw a therapist but the father never asked why, what pills she was taking or anything too personal. We all assumed she was so well off that she would have no worries. As we handed out fliers for her company opening I started to notice at night she was drinking straight wine from the bottle. No one knew she drank when I informed her son I was worried she was going over board at night. A day later she hit her head on the bathroom counter, said she fell over but I knew the real reason was because she drank much and fell over.   We tried taking her to the hospital, she kept saying no til two days later she was slurring her words hard. I woke up that morning with a friend that spent the night next to me. I saw her on the couch when I walked down eating breakfast, I asked how she was doing. She was barely making any words come out. I told her we were taking her to the hospital after I shower which gave me enough time to wait for her son to get home. I made myself a drink and a sand which and went upstairs and took a shower. I turned the water off and hears her son screaming for her to wake up. I knew what happened after I heard him scream for the third time, ""Mom! Wake up, please..."" I ran downstairs with my friend. I've never seen a dead person in real life. I don't know what dead people smell like. No one does. No ones prepared for that no matter how desensitized you or I would be until you see it happen. But when you see it, you'll know. You won't question it.   She was laid out on the couch. Blue pale skin. Olive pale skin with veins visible and patches of pink skin from what looks like straining. Her mouth open with drool to one side. One eye half open, blank stare. The other closed. No doubting if she was dead or not. He was on the phone with his dad asking what happened. I told him to hang up and call 911. They told him to do CPR til they got there. He didn't know how too. He was in shock. He turned to me and asked me too. I didn't know how too either but I was willing to try anything to try to make her come back. He handed me the phone and the lady walked me through how to give CPR. I proceeded. Drool, gunk and dry air entered my mouth through hers but I proceeded anyways. It was my first time almost having a panic attack. Not because of myself, but for the sake of the son. I put my arm around him when the ambulance came and he shrugged me off...  She was gone. And a vegetable in the ICU for a week before they pulled the plug. I had to leave two days before the funeral. I felt bad I couldn't be there. Be there for them. It turned out she was taking xanax constantly (explains the hair falling out) after hitting her head and mixing it with alcohol. The concussion, alcohol and xanax all made her so numb she couldn't swallow her own food that morning. She choked, overdosed and suffocated that morning. What is more salt to wound is that she had a voicemail from someone who was doing a business trip with her for her company saying they wanted out of the deal because they got incoherent messages form the mom. She was on pills and drinking through these messages while she had her concussion which is why we think she was depressed and seeing a therapist and popping pills like she did.   She was the closest thing to a second mom. And they were the closest thing to a family I felt like I belonged in throughout my life. I still talk to the family daily. The father is now an alcoholic who has no hopes to stop, and the son got caught up in cocaine and heavy drinking along with totalling two cars. The son they kicked out actually got his GED and is doing good. I still remember everything so clearly. Its not a memory that fades away easily. Please guys, get help immediately for people you care about. Whether it be concussion, drinking, drug use etc. I don't care. Just help and be there for them. Never over look a possible scenario that could end badly.  TL;DR friends mother died while i was living with them. Son found her dead. Always look after one another no matter what if you think its not your place to pay attention."

I feel guilty for not doing something sooner, but I ration that with how would I have known? But at the same time I'll contradict myself with what if scenarios. What I'd I would've never taken a shower? what if I heard her? What if I was there sooner? What if I could've saved a family being torn apart? Whenever I think of the entire situation it'll always end in what-ifs. I tell myself everything happened for a reason, but what came out of it was a whole lot of guilt and a torn family. Its never going to be a good scenario until everyone helps them self and each other. I feel as though the situation now is worse then the beginning when she died. So o try to stay on track with how they are doing now and helping them. Its not a burden but helping them is what takes our minds off of it and I enjoy keeping up and helping when I can here and there.  I think what got to me is this posts fb statuses is exactly how her son reacted to seeing his mother pass away."

Should he take an image of her in her deathbed, add a nice filter and upload it to his Instagram too? Or update his twitter, #deadmom #sucksforme ?

HorriblyDepressing,2k12bg,Fishvtt,1 point,Thu Oct 23 16:45:29 2014 UTC,"One could text a friend, call a friend, or talk to a friend in the room next to me due to feeling powerless to do anything at all, needing to not be alone, and share what's happening just so one may feel like someone has one's back.  Scared with no other way to cope, especially if all one can do is sit and watch, one may talk about it to SOMEONE, ANYONE, because what else can one do?  Just stare at her dying in the loudest possible silence?  I really can't see why you'd be so offended by that.  Also no, none of those things leave a bad taste in my mouth.  Because absolutely everyone reacts to death differently and whatever works for them PERSONALLY when it's someone close to them who died shouldn't be judged or insulted.  When I've lost loved ones, I'm cracking a bunch of jokes.  For me, someone with very severe thanataphobia, it's the only way to not collapse into the ground in tears and shakes for hours or possibly days.  But you'd probably insult me for joking about my mother's passing because it leaves a bad taste in YOUR mouth.  Edit: I had replied again but I don't feel like arguing with this guy all night about what is okay for other people to do in reaction to a dying or dead loved one.  The short version of what I posted is that this mindset is way too absolute regarding a very terrible situation and everyone is different."

If he was really upset and concerned he wouldn't be dicking around on facebook. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if he spent his time in the hospital checking his phone for comments and likes instead of spending it with his dying mother.  It's damn rude to keep checking your phone while eating dinner with someone. Doing the same to someone on their deathbed is fucked up.  It is in extremely poor taste to constantly update hundreds of random people on the status of a dying person without their knowledge, especially when phrased like ""SHE'S NOT WAKING UP FML"", ""she's in the hospital goddamnit"", and ""She died"". If I was his mom I'd be damn pissed and haunt the shit out of him.   ""My mother is very ill, please pray for her"" would have been more than sufficient.  Fuck your friend."

HorriblyDepressing,2jxysg,SMS450,8,Wed Oct 22 00:11:44 2014 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I don't really have any sympathy for this person. It's unfortunate that sexual abuse led them there, but all that came after stemmed from his/her drug use. Yes, absolutely, the police in this situation were harsher than necessary, but when you make a threat in a public forum to the lives of anyone, what the hell do you expect to happen? Sure, he wasn't in his right mind when he said it, and maybe his punishment was too harsh, but I got a very strong vibe of ""none of this is my fault, everyone else is ruining my life,"" which is just not true. Had he/she never started doing drugs and/or sought help for the sexual abuse and/not been so fucking cynical about everything, their life probably would've been a huge amount better."
HorriblyDepressing,2jxysg,Riobux,3,Wed Oct 22 09:15:48 2014 UTC,"While I'll admit I did get a small vibe of self-infliction, I'm not sure if you know about how sexual abuse can affect an individual. It can emotionally destroy an individual, horribly. Destroy relationships and friendships with others, as they suspect foul play constantly. Breed a paranoia. They associate even closeness, with that sexual abuse. There are people unable to be intimate with a partner, or even show any form of affection to them, as it just drums up images of their innocence between trampled upon.   So they suffer, and they hurt. They look for a form of silence. Recreational drugs that act like a depressant can help. Alcohol, weed and even heroin if you need something REALLY strong. After all, I doubt many people would look to the lifestyle associated with heroin and decide ""Yep! Seems nice to be addicted to that stuff!"". Sure some do, but I suspect a minority.   He/she might have never sought help, because of the damage sexual abuse creates on someone's sociability. It's like trying to grow crops, and then someone decides to rain down upon it with napalm. Sure there will be some stubborn growths, but the damage is obvious.   I'm sorry if you're aware of all this already. It's just sexual abuse can create severe problems with someone's psychology and cause them to do things that would seem REALLY stupid to the average person. They may lash out, concentrating negative feelings on someone else. It's even possible the poster blames the police in some way for the sexual abuse occurring. I'll admit that I'm pretty much just listing off how sexual abuse could have created all the problems the individual has, despite the fact that it's far from certain. Maybe the abuse has little to do with it, maybe it explains it all, it's really impossible.   With regards to why not seek help for sexual abuse, it's hard to admit you have a problem to a therapist. It's really hard to really dig down to the core problem, and expose it all. Perhaps you feel foolish, you're too embarrassed or you just don't want to be seen as ""that person"". You may describe the symptoms, but you're just not able to say the cause. That's even assuming you know it, perhaps you don't."
HorriblyDepressing,2jxysg,SMS450,1 point,Wed Oct 22 13:37:37 2014 UTC,"While I've never experienced this kind of abuse myself, I have a handful of friends and family members who have. I can't begin to understand how difficult something like that is, but I do know that almost everyone that I know who suffered this went for help, be it counseling, therapy, etc. Some went with an open mind, some were cynical like this guy, but in the end, they gave it a chance, and they improved drastically. I have no sympathy for the person in this scenario because I truly think they were far too cynical and close minded about therapy. One of my friends I mentioned is completely closed off to the idea of therapy, and so instead of seeking any help (or accepting it from anyone), he's slowly destroying his life. I'm beginning to have no sympathy for him, either.  Like I said, I can't begin to imagine how difficult of a thing sexual abuse is, but I do know from seeing it that therapy can help, but only if you allow it to. This guy clearly thought there was nothing they could do from the start, and so it's his close mindedness and cynicism that screwed him over."
HorriblyDepressing,2jxysg,Riobux,1 point,Wed Oct 22 17:53:32 2014 UTC,"What I am trying to say though is he/she closed the door on therapy due to the distrust sexual abuse creates. It's tough to fight through the distrust, and to believe that therapy will help. You are correct that you have to allow therapy to work by believing it will. Just, well, some people struggle to have a reason that therapy can work for them. If it's because they don't trust people, or they don't believe something as simple as therapy could help them with such a complex and dominating problem.   They're being destroyed by the very thing they need help with. If it was a very concious choice for no good reason, then I'd be doubting if to lend sympathy. However, it's that dark passenger part of them which is destroying the rest of their life that is whispering terrible things in their ear. I would somewhat compare it to being so anxious that it's destroying your social life and, well, the rest of your life, but you're just too anxious to look for help. You may know that therapy is the way to get help, but you're just too scared to do it."

I’m crying like a coward up there, screaming ""It’s a set-up, it’s a set-up!"""

HorriblyDepressing,2jrber,lannisterstark,5,Mon Oct 20 11:57:11 2014 UTC,"My father was involved in the liberation of a camp at the end of WWII.  He said you could smell it well before they found it (from the town several miles away if the wind was blowing right, even after they shut it down).  They made the townspeople, led by the mayor, tour the place and then bury the dead properly.  He doubted that any of them were innocent by that time in the war.  Maybe earlier on, but by the end it was pretty obvious what was happening.  He stated it was common knowledge but not spoken of, and pointed out that if it was such a well kept secret that the the Jews/gypsies/homosexuals wouldn't have known to hide/flee, Anne Frank wouldn't have hidden in an attic and the Nazis would have likely been successful. Being this far removed from the events of that era it's not surprising younger people don't know this.

It was carried out specifically by removing those involved from positions of influence and by disbanding or rendering impotent the organizations associated with it. The program of denazification was launched after the end of the Second World War and was solidified by the Potsdam Agreement.

Have you talked to your dad about how you feel?  You'd be surprised how much talking it out can really help, and like you said, your parents sacrificed a lot for you, so theyll want to you to be happy in the end.

It was expensive but she had her own apartment, could do what she wanted to (urban area so she could roll off in her wheelchair), they provided meals and had medical care on site. If she had stayed in her own home she would have become a recluse. Same if she moved into my house (burbs) -- my brother and sister lived in a house/apartment with stairs.  By time she moved to a nursing home she had had a stroke and needed dialysis, which was in the nursing home. She could still roll off, for a time, in her wheelchair. But that place was depressing. Standard huge nursing home where it felt like people were warehoused. Fortunately it was local to a lot of families and was pretty busy on weekends.  Newer homes that are being built now are much more humane."

In many ways, that is the worse option. Older people often need extensive medical help their children simply can't provide, never mind the fact they often need care 24/7 which working children can't give them. The issue becomes finding a retirement or nursing home that will actually care for the elderly properly. Do your research, spend time in the place, talk to the other residents. If it doesn't feel right, find someplace else. Visit often, if you can, or at least phone often. If my mom hadn't visited my grandpa every other day, we wouldn't have discovered he was trapped on the second floor because the elevator had broken. No one had phoned us.   If you need to put your parents in a home, do it. I don't think it's something to feel guilty about."

I think the first thing you should do, is have patience with yourself. You should not force yourself to situations you do not feel comfortable with. What I mean is, you are telling us you want to be social, which means there is a part of you who happens to like people, but you shouldn't go to a bar, if you hate bars, just to try and make friends.  Go do things you enjoy: cinema, library, a park, you choose. It will be easier to find people who have things in common with you, and even if you don't meet anyone, you'll still have a pretty good time. The first steps are always harder, but the more you practice doing things you like, the easierit will be to gear up."

One is that, as you mentioned, a large amount of MTG players are not extremely social. The second is that MTG is a rather competitive game so it's probably easy for those that play to see others as competitors / enemies so your ability to befriend new people in that circle, while possible, is lowered.  What other hobbies do you have? What type of area do you live in? How old are you? What other limits might you have on activities other than area and age?

It's probably not easy to approach new people in that environment but have you tried? Also, the mall isn't the worst place to go to get to know people better but it's not a great place to meet people really. Are there gaming centers maybe?

HorriblyDepressing,2jcfoc,yesitzme,2,Thu Oct 16 04:41:46 2014 UTC,"The key to happiness is low expectations. This doesn't sound very uplifting at first glance, but if you find a thing every day that makes you happy, even something little, and you write it down, you'll see that there are things that are awesome you might not be noticing. It'll help identify what it is you're happy about and you can put yourself in those positions more often. If you have a hobby (mine is carrying heavy things through the woods) and you even get a little interested in doing it better, people will bend over backwards to help you understand elevation change, your gear, places to do it, etc. That's my experience, from literally just walking up a hill.  Entitle yourself to ask. People don't owe you an answer, but sometimes you'll find someone will give you one anyway. There is no map for the world and every day is different. A long time ago I promised myself I wouldn't commit suicide ""just to see what happens if I don't"" and I've been pleasantly surprised. If you're not doing everything you can to make yourself healthy every day you're not doing your job as a person. The application of self-discipline over time is what character is, and you get it through many months and years of sacrifice. I'd rather be a guy who knows who he is than an idiot reflexively texting other idiots every ten minutes drifting from one meaningless social encounter to another forever."

HorriblyDepressing,2jcfoc,Natchil,1 point,Thu Oct 16 04:45:32 2014 UTC,"My condolences on the passing of your grandfather. Go to church or find a club or organization with people doing like-minded interests. just read you are not into the Mormon thing and can completely understand. But when I was a bad time in life that's what helped me. I mention church because God will heal you of your depression but it takes time. He will do it if you ask. There are also people who can counsel you and give you support for your grief and depression. If that's not your thing, go talk to somebody you can trust. Sometimes a stranger is easier than a relative.  But I would say is try to stay busy, both mentally and physically doing something preferably that can involve another person. Try starting a daily habit to replace internet, video games, etc. Once a day for 30 days as they say. Even if it's another job, or perhaps a hobby doing something with your hands and mind.  Nip this thing in the bud right now. It's ok, life will get you down but it's all in how you get back up. If you sit in this for too long it can rob you precious time doing real things with your life. Using this to deal with your feelings in a healthy way and developing mental toughness will yield dividends in your life to come.  The best way to stop hating people and yourself, is to start loving or at least serving others. Doing good things for others will make you feel good inside genuinely. They in turn will give you their love back. When you are busy serving others, there is little time to sit there and feel sorry about yourself. If you find you can't do it, just fake it for now until you start dealing with the grief. Just realize YOU have been put on this earth to help others. Someone you have never met may one day praise the day they met you because what you had or did for them. Someone loves you and will be counting on you. you may not know it yet. This is my own experience, and I have found when God gives a purpose, nothing is too hard to bear. just don't be afraid to ask for help. I hope this helps."

My mother was murdered in 2000, and the day we found out all I could do was sit in her room and smell her clothes and cry.  You think you'll never forget the smell, but you do. You think you'll never forget every detail of her, but things get fuzzy and sometimes you have to think of a very specific memory to remember her expressions or mannerisms.  I know that sounds terrible and not comforting but what I mean is that someday the pain dulls, eventually the hole inside yourself doesn't feel so raw and large and you realize that just because you don't remember those small things, it doesn't matter because the love you have for her will never diminish and that it's not callous to say to yourself that life goes on.  Moving on doesn't mean forgetting or never being sad or mad about it, but living your life in ways that would make your mother proud.  14 years later for me, I still have good cries, and bad days but they're fewer and farther between. When I have accomplishments and milestones in my life I think of her and how proud she would be of me.

Most of her possessions had long been divided among my brother, sister and I and we pretty much donated all her clothes to the nursing home. However, I did keep a few small trinkets for my home office that reminds me of her personality: a strange glittery baseball cap, a tiny Mardi Gras face mask, a very 1970s mirror I remember her and her mother buying at a street festival. From those I remember the woman she was and not the empty shell she had become at the end."

I may not remember the actual good times but I do remember that she was always happy when we did things together as a family."

HorriblyDepressing,2issjg,A_Pony,5,Fri Oct 10 00:06:32 2014 UTC,"Think about this, right. Say you're immortal, there are literally endless possibilities for things to do. There could be new technology, there could be amazing things like time travel tourism (maybe in a couple thousand years). But if we reach a type 7 civilization (look up the Kardashev scale if you haven't heard of it), we can literally create planets and universes for fun. You could do some experimenting, like making a planet and seeing how they would react if you send aliens down there. I know I could do just that one thing for thousands of years. There are countless other cool things you could do if you had immortality. I once had a dream where we evolved to a type 7 civilization, and we were pretty much gods. I thought about a ton of cool things like re-create a planet where the norse gods were real, and see how people would live. But before we reach that, there could be other cool things. Like a quantum computer that could make an AI that eventually replaces scientists, pumping out cool new technologies every year. Or other, equally cool things like discovering an alien planet and learning about their stories, and mythology and all that awesome stuff. We could compare our religions (if they survive that long, it depends if we finally find out how the universe was made or it's still unknown.).  But if you've heard of the inevitable end of the universe in a couple billion years, you would probably think something like ""Wait, we would die from it right?"". By then we could probably be a type 6 or even a 7 civilization. If we reach that level of power, we could make an entire new universe and then just wait for the new one to die.  So if you for some reason decide you don't want to live forever, it's fine. Just don't get the surgery or injection or whatever they give to make you immortal, and die like a normal man. Die never experiencing the amazing new world. It's your choice, no one's forcing you to.

The waiting list for low income beds in rehab is months. Detox takes hundreds of dollars even for a state bed, and does nothing if you're going right back to the same area and people. Really the only way to stay clean is to move away from everything and everyone, which takes money.   Methadone clinics are cheap and everywhere, but it's worse than the heroin and much much harder to detox off of. The clinics will say they'll slowly take your dose down, but they won't. You're income to them, they won't give up their income.   Addiction specialists are thousands of dollars. Hundreds per visit, and good luck finding one still accepting patients. The meds are outrageous.   Being a heroin addict is hell. You hate it, you hate yourself. But you need it. And if you get detoxed you want it like nothing you've ever wanted before. Imagine being so hungry and so thirsty while at the same time there's an itch on your nose but you can't reach it to scratch. The feeling and frustration is similar to addiction while trying to stay clean.   We've got to revamp the system somehow. You shouldn't have to be a movie star to get help."
HorriblyDepressing,2i79an,venomous_dove,16,Fri Oct 3 18:32:59 2014 UTC,"Methadone clinics are cheap and everywhere, but it's worse than the heroin and much much harder to detox off of.    While the longer half life does make detox longer, methadone is in no other way worse than heroin. Methadone won't get you nearly as high unless you mix in a benzo, so you'll actually be functional instead of nodding out all day. Methadone is extremely unlikely to cause an overdose when used in the prescribed amount. And it's debatable but I think the fact that methadone isn't as euphoric makes it better for tapering, as there's less temptation to take more since it will never do more than get you well.   Getting on methadone doesn't solve the problem it just changes it, but that's true of any opiate treatment. The bottom line is that if someone wants to get high they're going to get high."
HorriblyDepressing,2i79an,Poueff,11,Fri Oct 3 20:15:53 2014 UTC,"When I said worse I primarily meant as far as detox is concerned. Weeks of hell vs days. I've kicked everything there is repeatedly, nothing kicked my ass like methadone and nothing else ended up with me in the hospital.   But it could be said it's worse in other ways as well.   Methadone made me nod worse than anything else. And it effected my behavior much more dramatically, as it did with most everyone I knew on it. The mood swings are especially noticeable.   The decreased euphoria leads most to stack other drugs on the methadone. It isn't treating the addictive personality in any way, of course, so saying ""oh you shouldn't use other drugs"" is pointless. You'll still have the drive to seek them out. This is one reason methadone is one of the most common OD's, along with minimal supervision or limitation of dosage. I pegged myself out at 200mg per dose even though 120 probably would have held me. Weekends I'd do all 600mg at once. The majority of patients I knew did this, and after three years there I knew a lot of them well.   Methadone is also the only opiate that stands a chance of killing you from withdrawal. Deaths are usually secondary conditions exacerbated by withdrawal, but methadone has killed on its own, similar to benzos or alcohol.   The programs themselves are just legal dealers. You can't pay? Too bad, you're cold turkey regardless of risk or situation. They tell you it's illegal to just stop you, that they'll fast-drop you but it's not true. I was robbed and had two weeks of no income. Even after three years of solid payment daily and of the credit days they give you I was stopped cold at 200mg. I ended up in the hospital for three days with major issues. So even if the drug isn't ""worse"" the programs are. I asked them for months to drop me and they wouldn't let me. Two years later I was left in the cold.   I'm 18 months clean after almost a decade of heroin use, but if I relapse I'll never go back to methadone. It was the worst decision of my life, and I had no job related or family related drug issues until I used it. They have no interest in getting you clean, it's all about that money."

HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,DarlingDont,9,Sat Oct 4 02:18:42 2014 UTC,"I watched this earlier and I wish someone could give me a reason that they let this go full term. I'm not trying to be rude or anything, I really want to see the other side to this.  The baby did not get to live long. In the brief time it was alive, all it did was suffer. It couldn't breathe, and had to experience the pain of death. It didn't receive any joy in its little life, only pain. I just feel as if it could have all been avoided and that it was a slightly selfish thing to make it him go through that.  Obviously I have never been in this situation, and I may have had a totally different view if it was me, but I don't understand the reasoning..."
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,mirandawrites,7,Sat Oct 4 05:47:09 2014 UTC,"I agree. While the situation was sad for the parents, people seem to overlook the fact that they allowed their child to suffer for five days in order for them to recieve the gratification of having him there. I feel like a more appropriate response would have been to terminate the pregnancy, and mourn.   My stomach dropped when I heard their child's gasping. I could never imagine allowing my child to go through that painful process. I also wish there had been a reason given for prolonging the suffering of their infant."
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,Blue_Opheliac,2,Sat Oct 4 14:58:26 2014 UTC,Thank you! I explained my thought process to my friend and she thought I was crazy. It broke my heart that he had to be alive just to die.
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,mirandawrites,4,Sat Oct 4 15:42:10 2014 UTC,"I watched the whole video, and I didn't see/hear much suffering - at least until the end when I'm guessing he was gasping; but my point being - the baby seemed to act, react, and ""be"" just like any other day(s)-old infant I have ever seen...  I don't know a lot about trisomy 13, but just from this one video it doesn't seem like ""all it did was suffer.""    I am not a religious man.  And when I first found out my wife was pregnant with our daughter I struggled with the question of ""What do we do if we find out something is wrong?""...  And honestly, even today I still don't know if I can answer that question.  But now that my wife and I have had our daughter, and have been given the opportunity to watch her grow and learn and experience life these past 9 months...     I don't know.  If my daughter had turned out to have some sort of genetic defect where our physicians were absolutely positive that she would only live a fleeting life consumed in pain, then I would probably opt to terminate, for her sake... But if it were the case like what I saw in this video, where it isn't (seemingly) an issue of pain, but rather an issue of longevity... Then I don't think I would want to terminate.    Because if I can't give her all the things a father should, if I can't bring her the moon and shower her with love and comfort her heartaches and cheer her successes...  Then, I think, I should at least give her the one thing I can - the opportunity to exist."
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,ortho_engineer,1 point,Thu Oct 9 01:47:05 2014 UTC,"Then, I think, I should at least give her the one thing I can - the opportunity to exist   I do like that, it makes it sound more real. That was very nicely said. Like I said, I don't have kids and I know it would be different if I was in that situation, so I'm sure my view would be different then."
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,mirandawrites,2,Thu Oct 9 02:00:40 2014 UTC,"In the brief time it was alive, all it did was suffer. It couldn't breathe, and had to experience the pain of death.   It died in its sleep. That gasping it did at the end is a reflex action, it was already dead at that point.  It was also on pain medication, and didn't seem to suffer very much at all.  Also, its completely up to the mother. It's her body - that argument goes both ways. And her opinion was, she couldn't just pretend that her baby's life didn't matter. Like you said, it's easy for you to say ""terminate it"", but you aren't in her situation.  It's easy for ""the internet"" to fall into the convenient narrative of the horrible christian parents refusing to terminate (though they never mention that as a reason) and the baby only lived in agony (which it clearly didnt), but that bullshit just needs to be called out on."
HorriblyDepressing,2i8tzp,caitibug323,2,Thu Oct 9 17:58:38 2014 UTC,"I can't understand it myself.  And I'm a mom of a terminally ill child. If I were to get pregnant with another child and they tested positive for the genetic defect, I would terminate. Not for me, for the child. It is so selfish to bring a child into this world to suffer and die for your own sake. For your own moral wellbeing. So you don't have to feel guilt for aborting your child. It is fucking selfish and pisses me off.   I would rather live with guilt and remorse the rest of my life knowing I saved a child from having to suffer and die."

Not everyone is a large crowd of kids kind of person, and it's equally shitty to expect us to suck it up and deal.  The major crap part about this is the rsvping and then ditching it. But honestly, nobody's obligated to do just about anything social. If they all declined? That's absolutely their right. My entire family didn't mail me birthday cards this year, either.

I never had a birthday party in my life, but my family would always take us out wherever we wanted and let us eat what we wanted, got toys, money... We played a lot of social sports so it wasn't a big deal in that aspect.  She has you guys who care a lot and that's paramount.  Best wishes to this little angel."

It would have been a more  meaningful read if the author hadn't tried to sugarcoat everything.

HorriblyDepressing,2hwrsh,Barneysparky,2,Thu Oct 2 02:05:45 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how to answer that. I went from an upper middle class household to living in a ghetto culture ( I'm not sure how else to put that ) when I was barely 13. I think that's really had the biggest impact on my life in both positive and negative ways.   I still have problems fitting in or being comfortable in either, but I also can find my people in both.  I am very loyal when I care about someone, my radar for creep (asshole, bitch whatever)  is really strong, I have empathy for almost everyone but I choose not to associate with people who I don't really like. On the day to day that's my largest struggle, being friendly with people who I really don't want to be.  On the plus side of that I was in sales for years.  My ability to see inside people made me quite successful.   As far as romantic and sexual I do have dependency issues with my husband, if he is gone for a few days I tend towards depression. However I would not be considered clingy. Same house different rooms is fine with me.  Sexually I'm a bit out there for my age but nothing like the kids now a days.   I think that if someone who knew me well was to describe me they would say I'm a bit of a mess, I've lived an extraordinary life and somehow my kids are ok."

It was a loop, vitality leaves a way out of the loop. lack of vitality is the only way I know of to describe the dull pain and weight on me everyday."

HorriblyDepressing,2ho0wx,lordsparklehooves,5,Sun Sep 28 05:42:28 2014 UTC,"I don't think it was clear enough that I deserve sass. The sentence right after the end of the poem is in two tenses so I can't tell if the time at which he wrote the poem was the one in which he has the 4.0 and the gf and struggles with depression or if all of that is still true. I would lean toward still true (that he struggles with depression) except that he uses felt in past tense and gives advice and talks about how he saved his life, which would imply that he's feeling better.  I'm not faulting him for the ambiguity, I just want to understand because I had everything going for me (4.0 GPA triple major on track to graduate in 3 years with a full-ride, social with a close group of friends and a 3-year long relationship) and got suspended for 2 years because I tried to kill myself. So I was kinda hoping I found someone like me, since i haven't felt that similar to a lot of other people with depression because of different situations.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's no need to be a fucking dick and act so superior and condescending."
HorriblyDepressing,2ho0wx,Meloboii,7,Sun Sep 28 05:51:03 2014 UTC,"I still have all those things, and i still struggle with depression. I just feel like people don't understand depression. People think if you have no reason to be sad then you shouldn't be depressed, but depression isn't specifically about sadness, its more of a lack of vitality that comes from extreme amounts of stress. Depression makes you feel like you're no longer alive, I couldn't enjoy things I did before, I everything feels dull. I'd lay in bed for hours because I felt I had no reason to get up. Because of so many misconceptions about depression for a long time I thought I was sad, only when I started wanting to kill myself and decided to find help did I realize that you can live with depression.   I used to go to this reddit when I felt down and wallow in it, but one day I saw a suicide note someone posted asking what kind of gun would be best to kill himself with, and a redditor replied with   ""First before you buy the gun I want you to run, run until the sweat drips down your ass crack and you feel like collapsing, depression is an imbalance in chemicals and lack of vitality if you can try this and it doesn't change your mind buy a 44 magnum it'll get the job done.""    That changed my life and I think that this does belong here. It belongs here not because its hopeless and heartbreaking but because it's hopeful.   TLDR; I was majorly depressed during the 4.0 GPA everything's good in my life and continue to struggle with it. I think the post is a more realistic view of depression than most of the posts here."

HorriblyDepressing,2ho0wx,Nordoisthebest,1 point,Sun Sep 28 15:21:19 2014 UTC,"Maybe I was unclear. That all was happening during my depression, I wanted to show that depression isn't because someone is a failure or a loser. Depression is a medical condition. I don't believe in anti-depressants because suicide rates of people on those pills are higher than depressed people treated in other ways, but it is a real thing, not a phase, or being sad because you missed your favorite sports team play. the sub reddit you're looking for is ""horribly sad"" horribly depressed is for depression.  My mom is deaf, and I learned sign language to talk to her, she was teaching me some signs and I said ""no that's not how you sign it"" and she got quite upset and I didn't understand why, she explained that the signs mean whatever a deaf person wants them to mean, Deaf people have the authority to say was is proper sign language and what isn't.

A Facebook status isn't typically a place where people take emotional things like that seriously. There's always someone to talk to. I don't know your situation but, call your mom, hug one of your siblings, just talk to them, one-on-one.  If talking it out doesn't make you feel better, maybe something they say will.

It continually comes back in waves and wears the sufferer down to the point of death.  It's not as common a disorder as people think it is.  Feeling depressed, however, does fade.  If that's what this guy was talking about, then this video is uplifting.  If he was talking about major depressive disorder...it's kind of upsetting."

I once witnessed a cat dying too. I'm no animal expert, but I saw a cat in a suffering state, so naturally I thought it was hungry, so I went and got some milk and fish for it, because a friend of mine told me cats absolutely LOVE fish, and the milk? Well I thought that would be a complete nourishing drink to help the cat get energized or something. I couldn't stay with the cat as I had to leave, but when I got back, someone around the area told me that it had died, without eating a single bite. I really felt like crap after that."
HorriblyDepressing,2hdlyn,KidsInNeed,2,Thu Oct 2 11:23:44 2014 UTC,"A few years ago, while I was in  high school my mother and I saw an abandoned puppy across our street.  We thought it was the neighbors and thought nothing of it. The next day, the puppy was still there, in the same spot. Turns out, his back legs weren't functional. We thought someone ran over him but the vet said he was born like that. Long story short, we adopted him. He liked to be outside so we let him but made a device to hold his legs up because he liked to ""run"" around and his legs would get road rash. It rained hard one day, and we couldn't find him. I looked for him and he had found a tiny space in which he crawled into. I took him inside and that was that. The next day, my mother woke me up in terror that the dog wasn't doing well. I saw him and he was cold and very delirious. I wrapped him in some towels and hold him to pass some body heat and comfort him. As I was comforting him, he looked at me and gasped. Time stopped for me when he gasped. I saw his gasp in slow motion. His head went limp and he died in my hands.  I've seen dead animals before but never in my life have I had an animal die in my arms. This still haunts me."

HorriblyDepressing,2h0hz9,LerithXanatos,1 point,Wed Oct 1 01:52:44 2014 UTC,"Well, this is /r/horriblydepressing so...  I imagine the reason he's so 'off' is nothing nefarious. But he is off, because he still hasn't recovered from the divorce. More specifically, what caused the split.  He took their son to the playground like he had done hundreds of times before. His son played on the swings while he sat on the bench, playing with his phone and various other little distractions. Eventually looking up again, but not seeing his son.  After hours of searching, the police were called. No such luck, and his son remains missing to this day. So why does he come back to this park every few days even years later, chatting up strangers while seeming distant or distracted?  Maybe he's reminiscing about better times. Maybe he's thinking of his mistakes.  Maybe he still comes, watching the other kids on the playgrounds, hoping that as swiftly as he son disappeared from those swings, that he might be there this time..."

My parents got him a couple of months before I was born, so we literally grew up together. He was so chill and relaxed that most of my baby photos are of me laying on his belly, using him as a pillow. Every single memory I have of my childhood is somehow linked to that dog. He came to soccer games, he played with us in the yard, he hung out in the house at night. Everything. He was always there.  When I was old enough to get my own bed, it was Ben's bed, too. To this day I still sleep with my knees up to my chest, curled up in a ball, because that's how I had to sleep as a kid to make room for Ben. The fat bastard.  When I was about 14 or 15, Ben's legs got really bad. He could walk around, but not without resting every 10 or 15 minutes. He was still happy as fuck, though. But I remember the whole family just knew that he was on his way out.  One day though, Ben went missing.   We freaked out. He could barely walk – how could he run away? We drove around the neighbourhood for about an hour and finally found him at a tennis court about two or three kilometres away. He was running around full speed with a big dumb grin on his face, just like a puppy, playing with another Ridgeback he had met on his adventure.  We let him play for a bit, got him back into the car, then drove him home. About a week later, he curled up in his spot in the frontyard, went to sleep and never woke up.  I miss that fucking dog so much, man. This comic made me tear up. The wine probably isn't helping, either."

The oldest a child has ever lived like this was something like 3. In the 21st century we have ultrasounds and shitloads of tests to determine these kinds of things before hand so they had to know about this.

Imagine them first finding out they are going to have a kid and how the father wants to teach him to play catch or the mother wants to teach her to cook. Imagine them getting the babies room ready and excitingly awaiting the due date. Imagine them taking their family out to dinner before breaking the news to them, all the excitement in the air. Then imagine the doctor telling them that their baby will probably not survive too long after birth and that an abortion is their best option, i'm sure a lot of parents don't want to believe that, because only other people's children die."

It is a cephalic disorder that results from a neural tube defect that occurs when the rostral (head) end of the neural tube fails to close, usually between the 23rd and 26th days of conception.  Strictly speaking, the translation of the Greek term to English is ""no brain"" (that is, totally lacking), but it is accepted that children with this disorder are born without a telencephalon,  the largest part of the brain consisting mainly of the cerebral hemispheres, including the neocortex, which is responsible for cognition. The remaining brain tissue is often exposed, i.e. not covered by bone or skin.  With very few exceptions,  most babies with this disorder do not survive.

Why would the person film such a private and traumatic event about being disowned by his family due to something he can't control? It could be argued quite successfully that it's due to the filmer to want to share his pain with others, but I can't help but disagree. It feels like the person in question has a spiteful intention towards his family. That's not to say if they deserve it, but it feels like a spiteful moment to name and shame his family. It could be a ""this happens still to this day"" piece, although I'd argue why film such a private affair? You can tell others, that's fine, but to film it is another story.  Another part that bugs me is some of the points raised by the family. I accept that his homosexuality was a factor, they made it clear of that. However, some other parts were mentioned. Things like his father being disowned by the cameraman. Things like someone saying they did everything in the world, only to be yelled about on Facebook. It could be taken as a lie, but what motive do they have to lie? They don't know they're being filmed. The filmer knows the truth, and knows he's being filmed so he may have motivation to paint a particular view for the viewer, The view to downplay any flaws, and up-play all forms of homophobia.  It's tragic this guy got kicked out, partially due to his homosexuality. However, I just don't buy the idea his homosexuality was the sole factor. This is just too messy of a situation for the internet to comment on, especially as we only have the footage to judge by. Homophobia still exists, but I'm not sure if anyone should use this video to champion that cold social fact."

I think the internet needs to leave this situation be as it tends to be a force as subtle and careful as a napalm strike. Although in the filmer's favour, the video has become very popular online.

Just live one day to the next and have the mindset that every day is one day closer to getting better (you've hit rock bottom, so it can't get worse). Then look back a week, a month, a year, 5 years from now and see just how strong you were and what you were capable of to get past all the hell.   A more tangible idea is start running. I don't know how athletic you are, but running because you want to can really be sometime that you learn to love. Once you learn to love exercise is general, it becomes a hobby and eventually something you look forward to. I wasn't having the beat time a few months ago and the biggest thing that got me through was looking forward to my daily workout. Running is a good way to start, easy and can be done anywhere. Skip the treadmill, enjoy those beautiful Canadian outdoors. R/running can give you some tips as well as r/fitness.  If you take my advice and get into exercising, don't hesitate to PM me if you have any questions, I have a decent amount of experience with it. Good luck!!"

I can only imagine it's terrible, but that's all I can do: imagine.  However, what I would say is no matter what life throws at you, you have a choice about how you deal with it. You have no control over all this shit that's happening, but you do have control over how you react to it. So that's all you can do. React to it in the best way possible.   I can't give specific advice, because I don't feel qualified. But my general advice is not to worry about the things you can't change - because that doesn't help anything. You can't cure cancer, but you can help your mother deal with it in every way possible. You can't fix your father, but you can make sure you live your life in such a way that you never make the mistakes he did. Life hasn't been kind to you, but fuck it. You can give up, or you can fucking fight back."

He was diagnosed when we were in 2nd. Over the course of the first two years, he went from being an extremely active, involved father (coached soccer, softball, and volleyball and helped out around the school/our church quite frequently), to wheelchair bound and nonverbal. We helped her mom and older sisters try to keep up on the house as much as we could, but ALS is so time-consuming for everyone involved that you could almost watch the disease progress by watching their home fall into disrepair. My friend had to quit most of the extracurriculars she was involved in because her family couldn't afford them after paying for his medical expenses. Fortunately, our community stepped up and helped to fund some of her activities (sports uniforms, etc.).  He passed away in the middle of the night toward the end of the school year, and my friend was in class the next morning dry-eyed. She said she'd been watching her dad die every day for the past 4+ years, and the happiness she felt now that he was finally free from the burdens of the illness was greater than the pain of her loss. Everyone who knew her, and who knew her dad, could understand that sentiment entirely.  He was a great guy. I miss him. Fuck ALS."

HorriblyDepressing,2dvrmd,rodriguezlrichard,14,Mon Aug 18 13:15:04 2014 UTC,"There's a lot of depressing characters in Dark Souls. Some spoilers:  Siegmeyer Of Catarina, a character who travels for adventure and excitement who over time gets worn down and made to feel worthless as the player character just seems to save him so much. In the end, he either dies to creatures that he's trying to distract so you can get away, kills himself out of self-pity or turns hollow out of severe misery and worthlessness. If you let the third option occur, his daughter has to kill him.   Laurentius Of The Great Swamp is a pyromancer and quite possibly the happiest character you'll meet. Since you free him, he sells you pyromancy spells as well as talking in a very pleasant way. However, if you tell him of another pyromancer deep within Blighttown, he will go after it and it will be his undoing. You'll find him there hollowed, obviously never finding the pyromancer you spoke of.  Finally, and quite possibly the saddest of all, is Knight Artorias and his pet wolf Sif. In the DLC (which is based an unknown but many years in the past of the main game), you meet Knight Artorias as a boss. He is obviously using dark magic and corrupted. Wielding his bastard sword in one hand, as his other arm is obviously broken. If you go deeper into the dungeon, you find a very young Sif who is the size of a large wolf. If you use the protection, he is magically extracted out. What occurred was Knight Artorias was going to kill Manus, a dark ancient spirit who was trying to corrupt the world into the abyss. However, overrun by enemies, he uses his shield to protect Sif from harm as he's corrupted.  Assuming you do the DLC first, you end up slightly altering a boss fight. In the main game, you are forced to fight Sif. Without the DLC, Sif growls at you and warns you to stay away in the opening cutscene. If you did the DLC, Sif smells you and recognises your sent. He then walks over and picked up his weapon reluctantly: Artorias's bastard sword. It's clear Sif does not want to fight you, but must out of a sense of duty to protect Knight Artorias's ring which is required to go on.   But worry not, as Sif goes to join Knight Artorias, knowing that his duty is done and a spirit of worthwhile strength will use the ring correctly. This fan art really does fit it."

HorriblyDepressing,2du198,MonetaryMan,4,Sun Aug 17 23:45:06 2014 UTC,I felt bad for the mother the most.
HorriblyDepressing,2du198,Zerkyl,9,Mon Aug 18 04:03:26 2014 UTC,That mother was Definitely in bad shape but I actually felt worst (baddest? What's the word here?)  for the girlfriend character. IIRC every character except her was on some path towards kicking tier habit except her. Jared Leto lost his arm which will probably convince him to quit. The black friend was in prison   So he wasn't gonna be getting any more heroin for a while and since he felt extreme shame for ending up there he has some good motivation to become a better person once he gets out. And finally the mom ended up in the hospital so if she  hasn't already completely lost it she may stand some chance of getting better. The girlfriend character though is now working as a prostitute for some very scary dudes and shows no signs of quitting and would have great difficulty doing so even if she wanted to. So although I'm setting the bar pretty low as far as improving their respective lives I think each of the first three characters stand a chance of getting better and moving on to a better life while the GF is going to be stuck in that hell hole for a very long time.
HorriblyDepressing,2du198,abigfatphoney,3,Mon Aug 18 04:19:39 2014 UTC,Very interesting perspective on the movie. Never thought about that.
HorriblyDepressing,2du198,Jeroen23B,4,Mon Aug 18 04:26:38 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS I forget his name, but I felt just as bad for the black guy. Sure, he was in the business, but it never felt like he was a junkie to me. Seemed more like this was just the only way he knew how to make a living. I mean, just look at the scenes with him and his girlfriend, he seemed like such a sweet guy, and he got fucked forever,"
HorriblyDepressing,2du198,HorseSteroids,3,Mon Aug 18 04:17:28 2014 UTC,"I feel bad for them all because they all have the same motives. They all want to improve their own lives.  The mother doesn't feel loved anymore by her drug addicted son. She wants confirmation about herself, feel the love she used to have when their family was still happily together. That's why she wants to fit again in the red dress, the one she wore at the graduation of her son when everything was still okay.  The other 3 characters of the movie don't want to be addicted. They just are & it makes them feel good at that moment, but in the end they all wish to be clean. Harry & Marion's dream is to open up a new store together, like normal people. Tyrone's is to step up on the social ladder. They can only succeed in doing so by quickly gaining money - education & work is something they can't do in their situation. So the only choice they have in their eyes is to start selling drugs, as you've seen.  All four of them want to be good people and be happy with their friends & family. Yet by making the wrong choices, they all end up miserably alone. For me that's the true tragedy of the movie; in order to achieve their dreams, they have to make choices but they make the wrong ones. Their choices made their dream impossible to accomplish, hence the title ""Requiem for a Dream"". & that is something very relatable, more than the drug story on itself. Everyone has made choices in order to achieve something, yet in the end it backfires at you.  That is my interpretation of the movie & why it is my favourite movie. I do watch it about every year."

HorriblyDepressing,2du198,RedRowBlueBoat,5,Sun Aug 17 23:43:29 2014 UTC,"House MD's ending (up to the point when House calls Wilson at a funeral) is depressing as hell. Life On Mars (UK version) has some, as well as Ashes To Ashes, but the endings both hit the hardest. Two films that are depressing through-out for me are: Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind  and The Green Mile  I'll admit this is an anime, but Cowboy Bebop has two: 1. Jupiter Jazz parts 1 and 2. Mainly the character Gren. 2. The Real Folk Blues parts 1 and 2. To quote Spike, the main character: ""I'm not going there to die. I'm going to find out if I'm really alive."". To quote a Cowboy Bebop wiki: ""Spike's philosophy seems to be based on the ancient samurai ideals of immediacy, such as considering oneself as dead and the idea of death being an awakening from a dream, which are both elements of bushido illustrated in the Hagakure.""  Edit: Reddit formatting is weird."

Or the ending of Kill La Kill where Senketsu is torn to bits in the atmosphere.  Or Angel Beats, when you learn how the main character really died. Any of the characters, in fact. And the 'graduation' at the end...fuck, that whole show was sad, really!

HorriblyDepressing,2du198,sdshelt,2,Mon Aug 18 04:48:58 2014 UTC,"Speaking of Indian cinema I found Devdas to be soul crushing. I went to see it by myself at a local art gallery on the big screen for their Bollywood week. I held back the tears because I hate crying in public especially by myself and I sobbed all the way home in my car. I read the book a couple of years later and it was even more depressing than the movie! *edit to add: I've seen Baghban and found the message to be awesome, although I felt they exaggerated both actions of the adopted and bio kids, but it was a good movie. And terribly sad how the kids hurt their parents that way."
HorriblyDepressing,2du198,Leevar,2,Mon Aug 18 14:32:23 2014 UTC,"I've not seen Devdas, I will check it out.  I agree with you on the exaggeration part, if they didn't exaggerate then there would be no movie :P but this kind of thing does happen and sometimes the kids take their parents for granted and move on.  What I like about it is the contrast between the behavior of the adopted kid who had nothing and the bio kids who had everything (due to parents' sacrifice).   Also the analogy used in the final speech; parent-children relationships are not like a a step of a ladder you use to climb up and move forward, but like a tree, no matter how high up you go, the connection is still there with the soul of the tree deep inside."

""Lies"" (also by Stan) is pretty emotional, although it's more bittersweet than straight-up depressing.  I'm surprised Elliott Smith hasn't been mentioned. Pretty much any one of his songs can put a damper on whatever elation you may be feeling. It's pretty hard to pick the most depressing Elliott Smith tracks, but if I was forced to arbitrarily pick 3 I would have to go with ""I Didn't Understand"", ""Pitseleh"", and ""No Name No. 5"", in no particular order. ""The White Lady Loves You More"" gets an honorable mention. As does ""Roman Candle"". And ""Last Call"". And then there's ""Strung Out Again"", which is almost sort of comically morose and fatalistic.   And of course there's The Smiths. I'd nominate ""I Know It's Over"" and ""Well I Wonder""."

Coil - Cold Cell .. so many sad Coil songs, but this one hits me the most. This or Broccoli maybe, or Ostia, or i dunno.. there are just too many sad Coil songs.   Rasputina - Quitter .. suicidal stuff. Maybe a bit cheesy with those cellos and shit, but lyrics hit me hard for some reason. ""I'll be glad to go"". Damn.   Fall of Saigon - She leaves me all alone ..it's like a pop song but depressed or like numb on antidepressants. I love these 80's minimal wave bands' take on sadness/depression.. There's no ""epicness"" -- Hollywood style emotional roller coasters. Everything is just dirty, brown and miserable, just like reality.  Tropic of Cancer - Beneath the Light .. no idea how the lyrics go. All i hear is mumbling. But anyways to me this just feels very bleak and somehow hopeless. New'ish tune, but reminds me of that 80's stuff I like.   King Geedorah - I wonder ..it's hip hop. Super emo strings (sampled from Jaques Morelenbaum - ?) and lines like ""my brother got stabbed and i miss him"". Sad story, sad music. Maybe it's too pop to be horribly depressing.  Leevi and the Leavings - En tahdo sinua enää .. Finnish 1982 ""synth pop/italo disco"" track about a failed relationship. A real tearjerker if you understand the lyrics. I love those wonky synth arpeggios(?) and cheap Casio whatever piano sounds. They keep the emotions life size and real, not overproduced and ""larger than life"".

HorriblyDepressing,2dp4mf,danray2000,3,Sat Aug 16 18:46:04 2014 UTC,Gloomy Sundays by Billie Holiday. Also known as the hungarian suicide song.  Banned on the radio for many years because of how sad it was.  A last verse was added to it to be allowd on the radio about it all being a dream.  That added verse just doesn't fit. I can't sing that song without tears coming to my eyes

HorriblyDepressing,2dp4mf,AdvocateForLucifer,6,Thu Aug 28 09:05:57 2014 UTC,"Edit The Sad Parts -- Modest Mouse  Now, Modest Mouse has a lot of sad songs, but this one in particular always stood out to me. I love how it starts off feeling like a punch to the stomach. And then Isaac Brock starts singing, and if you're in a shitty mood, you immediately relate. He's singing about you. ""Sometimes all I really want to feel is loved. Sometimes I'm angry that I feel so angry. Sometimes my feelings get in the way of what I really feel I needed to say""  Jesus -- Brand New  Brand New is another band which gives you a lot of options, but this one stands out to me for some reason.   So Long, Lonesome -- Explosions In The Sky  If it's possible for an instrumental song to be sad, this one fits the bill. I wouldn't even call it depressing; it's actually a beautiful song. But when you're in that certain frame of mind, it's extremely powerful.  All Along -- Kid Cudi  Again, another song with sad, relateable lyrics. Basically anything by CuDi will have this same formula, particularly his two Man On The Moon albums. The acceptance of his fate in this song is just so sad. You know you're in a bad place when you start to feel like you'd be better off without anyone else, or that you deserve to be alone.  I Feel Like Dying -- Lil Wayne  Not your typical Lil Wayne track, in this one he takes a step back from his brag tracks and talking about bitches (nothing wrong with that btw), to a more personal song about addiction. Without drugs killing him slowly, he can't live. His codeine addiction makes this all the more tragic.  New Doomsdays -- Mimicking Birds  This song is more depressing in the cosmic sense. It starts off talking about how insignificant humankind is, and goes on to claim that we haven't accomplished anything 'good' in the last century. And even worse, one day we'll fly off in to space and establish us a new place to devastate. We're not all going to die as a result of the a Universal doomsday, rather, it's human nature to kill the universe.  Notorious BIG -- Suicidal Thoughts  ""When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell; cuz I'm a piece of shit it ain't hard to fucking tell."" This one starts off depressing and gets more and more so the more you listen to it.  Da Art of Storytellin' Pt 1 -- Outkast  The story that André tells about a girl who just wants to be alive, only to die of an overdose is just tragic. This line in particular has always struck me: ""Asked her what she wanna be, she said, 'alive.'"" If you want a song that will make your life seem meaningful, there it is.  Sleep Forever -- Portugal. The Man  Another song to put under the 'depressingly beautiful' label, I'm not going to say much about it. Just turn out all the lights in your room, close your eyes and listen to it."

Also nothing gets me teary eyed quite like Harry Nilsson's cover of Without You. First heard it in Rules of Attraction to a depressing scene. Sleeper 1972 - Manchester Orchestra gets me too."
HorriblyDepressing,2dp4mf,Riobux,5,Sat Aug 16 06:30:04 2014 UTC,"Funny you mention Harry Nilsson's cover of Without You. The original has a bit of a depressing twist to it. The original version of Without You was by Badfinger, however they just couldn't get a hit at all. The money they got was mostly by covers of Without You. However, the band got ripped apart by finances due to being ripped off by their manager. In the end though, one of the two song writers, Pete Ham, killed himself in 1975, blaming the manager for it all. This caused the band to break up.  In 1983, after an argument about royalties of the song, the other song writer Tom Evans killed himself. One of the factors that led up to it was Tom Evans never really getting over the death of Pete Ham. His wife was quoted in a documentary saying ""Tommy said 'I want to be where Pete is. It's a better place than down here' ...."".  So, that chorus: ""I can't live if living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore I can't live if living is without you I can't live, I can't give anymore""  Seems awfully appropriate now."

HorriblyDepressing,2dp4mf,Electricmoo,2,Sat Aug 16 11:32:54 2014 UTC,"For me there are 2 kinds of sad songs. The ones that make me sad and the ones that I listen to get past sad to go from sad to melancholy or just to clear my head and not registering emotions for a moment. The ones that make me sad are mostly related to memories such as: REM - Everbody Hurts - Played in the radio as I drove home from my first girlfriend after it was evident things weren't gonna work out despite that we weren't broken up yet. It was a long 4½hr drive. DJ Sammy - Heaven - By gut I hated that song but it would be played on the radio several times during the trip to and from the hospital every day for my cancer treatment. I still don't like it, it just takes me back to simpler times. The Fray - How To Save A Life - Altho this one isn't related to a personal memory it gets to me everytime and I can thank John C. McGinley's great acting for that. The Scrubs episode where he, as Dr. Cox, loses 3 patients and he lets it get to him. To see this strong and impenetrable person just collapse is like watching the twin towers go down: Here are these majestic buildings just crumbling and you can just, though not literally, see the life and energy gone. (Hope the analogy wasn't offensive to some).    Other songs I listen to that doesn't necessarily get me sad or have a sad feel to 'em but they definitely get my to a melancholy state: In Flames - Metaphor Seether - The Gift Exilia - Starseed - Althought this one has rather variating effects depending on the mood I'm in when I listen to it.  I really liked getting peak into what others find sad as well as adding some new sad songs to my collection. Hopefully I contributed to some of you as well."

Can you imagine the symptoms in someone who fought the Galls in Caesar's army? Or someone who was in an armored charge in The War of the Roses? Or watched the person next to them get covered in boiling pitch? I bet ex-soldiers had the condition bad throughout history, but everyone just thought it was normal since they didn't know anything about mental wellness."

HorriblyDepressing,2dam6t,Kailgon,3,Tue Aug 12 21:49:38 2014 UTC,"It is, put in it's purest form for me, is a TV with the brightness turned down. The great times are okay or good, the okay times are acceptable, and the acceptable times are bad. Just everything is a little worse. When distracted, everything is fine as I am able to deal with things being okay or acceptable when distracted, but just left to my own devices I'm left thinking. The poor quality TV that makes the picture a bit worse than it should be, is given the chance to tell me things. It'll remind me about horrible things. It'll speak to me why my future is doomed, why I can't trust anyone and other horrible things that cut into me.  Now, the horrid thing of thing is this: I don't want to dump the TV. I know what to do somewhat. I know I could do things that could improve the picture or get it to stop speaking to me as much as it does, but I don't want to. I want it to tear into me, I want it to get worse. I want it to really hit the sore points, so one day I quit. So one day I do something that silences the constant anxiety that follows my entire life and the bleak outlook and the social outcast nature that has followed me since my early teens. I don't want to have to just cope with being a social outcast or living with constant fear and anxiety of everything and everyone, I just want it to end, Just silence.  I don't wish to cheapen others' experiences, nor am I sure if it is depression (not diagnosed anyway). I've just got a broken down TV and got a self-destructive slant."

I went through the worst depression for about 6 months (2 years ago)  I will never forget it.  The sleepless nights, lying on the couch all day, only to get up and pace my apt. Over and over, then back to the couch.  I havent felt that bad in a while but there are days where it gets to me and I am in my own head all day."
HorriblyDepressing,2dam6t,Buddehy,1 point,Tue Aug 12 11:45:34 2014 UTC,"I think of my depression in a few ways, depending on how it hits me.  Sometimes my depression feels like my brain is a puzzle. It feels as though somebody has played with the puzzle, and put the pieces back in the wrong places. It just feels wrong, but with no specific reason. I feel wrong.  Sometimes I feel as though I'm on a roundabout. It's spinning faster and faster, messing up the way I see the world. It's out of my control, nothing I do will make the roundabout stop. If I put out my hands to try and slow it down, my hands get burnt by the friction and I end up injured. Sometimes I'll put my hands out on purpose, because I want to get injured. I can't control the speed of the roundabout, I can't control when it stops...so I try my hardest to control other things.   Depression is a very hard thing to define. It affects people in different ways, and it feels different and unique to every individual. Your view of it isn't stupid. That's the way depression makes you feel, that's not stupid. Sorry this is so long, I just felt like it'd be nice to contribute. I feel like people don't understand depression very well unless they've experienced it for themselves, and I find it interesting and helpful to see the way you've all described your experience and feelings concerning depression."
HorriblyDepressing,2d8e0x,Lolo4369,26,Mon Aug 11 13:31:09 2014 UTC,This article seems to be strongly implying that Tony Stewart hit him on purpose? It genuinely seemed like an accident to me... Why the fuck would you run out into the center of a race track?
HorriblyDepressing,2d8e0x,MILK_DUD_NIPPLES,17,Mon Aug 11 13:46:55 2014 UTC,"As has been said a thousand times around reddit, the cars have to hit the throttle in order to maintain control into a turn on a dirt track. You can see he's trying to turn away from him but fishtails too much and swipes him with the rear tire.  If he hadn't been revving he'd have had no control and the car would have just rolled into him head on."

HorriblyDepressing,2d8e0x,DogKnowsBest,7,Mon Aug 11 19:26:25 2014 UTC,"You should read different articles.  It's not clear whether Stewarts car touched Wards car to cause the initial wreck. But even if it did, that's part of racing.  When two cars are trying to get to the same spot first, one eventually loses.  This is a part of racing.  As far as having a history of aggression and anger issues?  All competitive drivers have aggression issues.  But that doesn't matter here.  Why?  Because past issues cannot be brought to evidence for the present.  Lastly, none of this would have happened in Kevin Ward, Jr. had stayed in his car until safety crews arrived as Track Rules require.  Instead, he jumps out of his car like a hot-head, rushes down the track shaking his fist, almost getting hit by the 45 car that was in front of Stewart, then makes another move before getting hit by Stewart.  As horrible as it is, Kevin Ward, Jr. is responsible for his own death; no one else.  As far as your title goes, it's unnecessarily slanted towards Stewart being at fault.  It reads as if TS has already been tried and convicted of a crime; which he has not and likely will not ever."
HorriblyDepressing,2d8e0x,Gaveltime,11,Mon Aug 11 14:09:52 2014 UTC,"This title is sensationalist and misleading. No reasonable person would conclude after watching the video that Tony Stewart was at fault, as the title heavily implies.   I've seen comments say that it looks like Stewart revved up his engine and hit him on purpose, which has been thoroughly debunked. I guess that's a matter of perspective, because to me it looks like some dumb asshole was trying to fistfight cars."

You got clipped, your car won't restart, it's upsetting but fuck dude, don't walk where people are fucking driving!  I would have wanted to scare him too. It's just poor luck that the car jumped to the side and sucked him under. Everything about this is a tragedy. This kid lost his life for nothing. Tony Stewart is never going to live this down. All because Ward decided to (essentially) throw a road rage tantrum.  Sorry, it's just that people see this and think it's OK to meander in traffic. Rant over."

HorriblyDepressing,2cwu22,throwmeaway76,17,Thu Aug 7 23:23:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Mr Freeze is meant to be a pretty tragic character. His wife had an incurable disease and was cryogenically frozen so he could find a cure. If i remember correctly, there was an accident with his cryo technology and his body temperature was altered to be below 0, so he could only live in freezing environments. He had a bunch of neat gadgets that could make snow, freeze rays, that kind of thing. So presumably here he made it snow in memory of his wife."
HorriblyDepressing,2cwu22,Dangfango,6,Fri Aug 8 02:34:03 2014 UTC,The story usually goes: his wife was dying so he put her in cryogenic stasis. After years without making progress his boss decided he was a waste of money and tried to shut Freeze down. They struggled and Freeze was pinned beneath some equipment while the lab was filled with chemicals and cryogenic materials.  Depending on the author some times the accident causes his wife's chamber to fail and Victor Freeze gets to watch his wife thaw and die while he's turned into a monster.

Such declaration could result in the juveniles' continued removal from your custody and placement in the care of some suitable person, agency or institution.  An adjudication hearing on this matter is scheduled for January 15, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. at the Sebastian County Courts Building, 901 South B Street, Fort Smith, AR. If you desire to be represented by an attorney, you should immediately contact your attorney so that an answer can be filed for you and he may appear with you at any hearing.

NOW, unless you appear and defend or otherwise respond within thirty days from the first date of publication of this notice, the Petition may be taken as confessed, and a decree entered and granted.

HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,keflexxx,50,Mon Aug 4 06:30:26 2014 UTC,don't really understand why this makes you feel bad  the dead don't deserve special respect just because they died. you make your comments based on merit; if someone merits being called an asshole then that remains true if they're alive or not. hell it remains true even if said comment leads them to go away and kill themselves. you didn't put a gun to their head.
HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,TheCheesy,42,Tue Aug 5 00:03:36 2014 UTC,I think it's mainly cause he was some child who didn't know his current problems were meaningless and thought suicide was the right choice for this somehow?
HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,keflexxx,-20,Mon Aug 4 04:04:22 2014 UTC,"yeah look that's not exactly a great outcome for a person  but there are millions of people out there who go through things equally as bad, if not worse. having a special place in your heart for this kid because you ran across one of his YT comments kinda seems silly in the wider context of global human misery.  i don't want to suggest that i don't understand why OP felt this way; being confronted by these things makes them more real and that can cause sadness. but as much as we can we should aim to direct our emotions towards their best ends. this just doesn't feel like the road to take."

HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,keflexxx,4,Mon Aug 4 10:58:39 2014 UTC,It's impossible to aspire to things during serious depression. You can't even aspire to get out of bed

It's not ""well maybe if I think more positively I'll feel better!""  it's ""this will never get better and death is preferable and every person who says cheer up makes this worse"""

Maybe the kid isnt an asshole but is breaking down due to untreated depression and to have insulted him would have been more salt on the wound but not a valid observation on the actual character of that person were they not in despair. I mean if we are in mourning for instance or depressed, irritability, anger, etc are symptoms of that, not character traits. Maybe OP is realizing that it would have been unfair, mean and perhaps unwarranted and harmful. Thats how I'd feel anyway."

HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,sergeantmunch,2,Mon Aug 4 04:22:32 2014 UTC,"I agree with you here. My uncle molested me and repeatedly abused me throughout my childhood all the way up until I was thirteen, but because he was killed when I was sixteen no one ever mentions how shitty a person he could be. It's always ""RIP"" ""you were so funny and sweet and I miss you"", etc. and I always think, yes, you loved him, but what about the shit I still have to process as a result of his deciding for some reason that I was a perfect target? Did his getting killed erase every bad thing he ever did? Apparently so."

HorriblyDepressing,2ck2ct,needvanwilder,3,Mon Aug 4 14:03:50 2014 UTC,"It's not always about the friends and family. Sometimes it's more selfish to force someone to stay alive so you don' have to feel the pain of their passing than it is to let them end THEIR pain. If you love them, and they feel like it truly is the only way out, then you should fucking let them go. It's not your life, and it isn't you who has to live inside that darkness, that pain, whatever it is, day after day. You have no right to tell that person to keep enduring that shit just because it would make you miserable.   My point is, if this kid's life was as shitty as he felt it was, then it means that staying alive would have put HIM through an unbearable misery that would haunt him for the rest of his life. Are you saying his family have more right to peace than he did?"

Didn't think it would be a third song. I guess they have an extensive library on the subject, although I'll admit Point/Counterpoint feels a bit on the blunt side. Not as bad as Bullet by Hollywood Undead, but it feels...I don't know...Although I don't doubt it most likely is a happier sounding song about suicide than Bullet.  Although I wish to submit another song as possibly happier, or maybe something else: U And I In Suicide by That Handsome Devil  Then again, That Handsome Devil has that weird tongue-in-cheek humour to it. It's the musical equivalent of driving an apple red convertible off a cliff not out of depression but out of excitement, joy and a distinct sensation of ""fuck it"".  I'd also recommend Viva Discordia, Eristocrats (Discordia Pt II), Rob The Prez-O-Dent, Wintergreen and Bullet Math."

HorriblyDepressing,2chhf8,Matthew_Chr,4,Thu Aug 21 06:01:48 2014 UTC,"""Depression can be found in those who seem happy"" is the take I always had on the song. I find HU always have a certain bluntness with their music, so I might just be giving them too much credit."
HorriblyDepressing,2chhf8,Riobux,0,Sun Aug 3 22:12:44 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think you're giving too much credit in this case. It's the bluntness I don't appreciate, as it feels very insincere. Not only due to the ""show, don't tell"" thing that music like this just disregards, but it has a heavy fake feel of ""oh, that's what depression is? Waking up and wanting a big old chug of pills and gin, right?"". Barely anyone is thinking about ""well, I better go get a gun and blow my head off"", but rather ""oh god, I need an escape"". It's less the method, and more escapism.  Even if you just focus on the lyrics, there's none of the melancholy, just a lot of ""hey, suicide! Ha!"".   It's not even a case of dissonance between music and lyrics, like UB40's Red Red Wine (the real message really comes out in the original by Niel Diamond, where it's about alcoholism), but just being just too blunt. It's not like, say, So You Wanna Be A Superhero by Carissa's Wierd which I'll admit doesn't have any form of dissonance of music and lyrics. It's clearly a song about severe misery and possible suicide, but it never states too clearly. It's written in a way I can actually buy this was written by someone who's been through that period.  I can elaborate what I mean, but I fear it may end up a long long post where I pick apart the lyrics of So You Wanna Be A Superhero by Carissa's Wierd in comparison to Bullet by Hollywood Undead. Just, in comparison, Bullet feels like a cheap cash-in where talking about suicide methods just seems to forget that there is the escapism part."
HorriblyDepressing,2chhf8,Matthew_Chr,-2,Sun Aug 3 23:28:46 2014 UTC,Very perceptive! I never realized that. You've succeeded in making me regret purchasing the song. Cheers ;)
HorriblyDepressing,2chhf8,Riobux,-2,Mon Aug 4 10:29:48 2014 UTC,"Haha, I'm not sure if to thank you or not. I'll admit without the smilie at the end, I'd take it as you being deeply sarcastic, or perhaps serious but annoyed. Honestly, if you want a good melancholic depressing song, well, I've mentioned two in my post (the Carissa's Wierd and Neil Diamond song, the dissonance UB40 gives just doesn't do it for me). Hell, I'd say check out Carissa's Wierd discography and the discography of who wrote So You Wanna Be A Superhero, who goes by the alias Jenn Ghetto or S.   There's also Failure by The Swans and perhaps Get Out Get Out Get Out by Jason Molina or Squares. Jason Molina did the original, and it shows he wrote from his heart with the acoustic style. However, I have a personal love for the chaotic style Squares went with. The way I personally thought of it was Jason Molina's version is like being unable to sleep and running through the same thoughts, while the Squares version is more like getting drunk and getting angry at knowing there should be better.  I can put together a list, but I think I've already mentioned the two songs that hit the hardest for me."
HorriblyDepressing,2chhf8,Matthew_Chr,-2,Mon Aug 4 14:38:16 2014 UTC,"The only annoyance at that point was my realization of having given them a solid dollar for the song. I rather like the Carissa's Wierd song.. I'll be listening to that one for a while. Thanks for the suggestions! I'll sift through the rest of them.  One you might already know that came to mind was The Cure's ""One Hundred Years"". It really gives off a really depressive atmosphere in sound and lyrical content without being too direct. If you don't know it, I recommend checking it out!"

I did try to check out the song you recommend, but it just didn't click with me. I do like other songs by The Cure like Just Like Heaven and Close To Me. There's also a fantastic cover of The Cure song Lovesong by Tori Amos. Just One Hundred Years didn't do anything for me. Sorry."

HorriblyDepressing,2c72d6,jorgander,3,Thu Jul 31 00:53:20 2014 UTC,"The movie gets its name from an experiment done by Duncan MacDougall, a physician who precisely weighed several people as they died.  At the exact moment of death, patients lost a very small amount of weight, and this amount has been popularized as 21 grams.  The urban legend is that this is the weight of the soul, and the weight loss occurs as the soul leaves the body.  More info from snopes:   MacDougall's results were flawed because the methodology used to harvest them was suspect, the sample size far too small, and the ability to measure changes in weight imprecise. For this reason, credence should not be given to the idea his experiments proved something, let alone that they measured the weight of the soul as 21 grams. His postulations on this topic are a curiosity, but nothing more."

HorriblyDepressing,2c2k0o,Ghost4000,21,Wed Jul 30 05:47:04 2014 UTC,"No.  They were raised in a culture where they were indoctrinated in government schools to believe that they live in the greatest country in the world, that what we do is just, that soldiers are heroes who defend freedom, and perhaps most importantly that joining the military will make them better people, pay for their education, pay for their healthcare, and give them a chance at a better life.  Before they were probably old enough to drink (and possibly before they were old enough to consent to sex), they were convinced by recruiters to sign their rights away in pursuit of the aforementioned ideals.  I don't know about you, but I didn't have a finely tuned ethical theory at 18.  Modern warfare is victims killing victims.  You're pointing fingers at the wrong people."

And for some people it may be.   It gets you out of your home town if that's what you want. It's gaurenteed employment. They help pay for college. Retirement in 20 years. See the world. etc, etc. I've lived through the recruiting process and very nearly joined the Navy (all I had to do was sign on the dotted line, literally), obviously I chose not too.   My point is joining the military doesn't make them evil and doesn't even make them accountable for these wars. Most of them were practically kids when they were convinced to join.   Once again I'll say to you, focus your attention on the politicians. They're the ones who actually start the wars, hell they're even the ones directly or indirectly responsible the the militaries recruiting methods that get so many kids to sign up."

Snitter has had his brain experimented upon while Rowf has been drowned and resuscitated repeatedly. One evening, Snitter squeezes under his cage and into Rowf's, where they discover his cage is unlatched. Eager to escape the tortures of life inside the facility, they explore, knocking over other cages and finally sneaking into the incinerator, where they are nearly killed before escaping."

The film was written, directed and produced by Martin Rosen, who also directed Watership Down, the film version of another novel by Adams. The Plague Dogs was produced by Nepenthe Productions; it was released by Embassy Pictures in the United States and by United Artists in the United Kingdom. The film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA for violent images and thematic elements.  The film's story is centered on two dogs named Rowf and Snitter, who escape from a research laboratory in Great Britain. In the process of telling the story, the film highlights the cruelty of performing vivisection and animal research for its own sake (though Martin Rosen said that this was not an anti-vivisection film, but an adventure), an idea that had only recently come to public attention during the 1960s and 1970s.

For those of you who don't know, even the best schools were horrible. The ones who didn't physically, sexually, and mentally abuse the children were still actively trying to ""kill the Indian in the child"". They were not allowed to speak their language, not allowed to acknowledge they had family outside of the school, not allowed to practice their religion (and forced to practiced Catholicism), and basically made into mindless drones from the repeated psychological abuse they suffered. There are countless unmarked graves in this country hiding little children who were murdered by the government and those employed by the government.

It is based on an idea, common to many science fiction stories, that a mad scientist, machine, or other entity might remove a person's brain from the body, suspend it in a vat of life-sustaining liquid, and connect its neurons by wires to a supercomputer which would provide it with electrical impulses identical to those the brain normally receives. According to such stories, the computer would then be simulating reality (including appropriate responses to the brain's own output) and the person with the ""disembodied"" brain would continue to have perfectly normal conscious experiences without these being related to objects or events in the real world.

They, the men's rights activists who tip fedoras to each other.

His parents bought a shit ton of pizza and tokens for everyone invited. Sadly, I was the only one that went. I was too young and oblivious to realize that TC was not popular, or that there were even supposed to be more kids there. I just enjoyed double pizza and loads of tokens like nothing was happening. My mom told me as an adult what had happened, and I am so glad she played it off for TC's sake. Just so you know, had I been invited to your birthdays, I would have been that one kid that showed up."

A few years back, on the anniversary of 9/11, they did this in the Temple of Dendur in the Met in Manhattan. It's different, but it's breathtaking. They added percussion, which adds this really distinct feeling of optimism. It changes the mood of the piece, which is very interesting."

But living in a broken postwar family meant she had to drop out of fourth grade to take care of her two sibling who ironically were both lazy in school.  By the time it was my dad's turn, he became an engineer and interned in Japan (much to my Grandma's dismay, but better than him repeating her life). We now live in New Zealand.  It's easy to tell she still regrets not being able to do that. Her love of knowledge means she always watches the news on her tablet, goes to English classes (and tried to converse with other people in it), and reads books.
