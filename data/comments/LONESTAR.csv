If you end up on Galveston you have to go to shrimp and stuff on 39th and O ave. Fuck the Spot, everyone talks about the Spot, it's a shitty tourist trap on the sea wall."

LONESTAR,3axbip,DrBenisher,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:57:35 2015 UTC,"Rodeo Goat in Fort Worth, The Dairyette in Dallas, Stackhouse in Dallas, and Wild About Harry's  in Dallas. Also if you want coffee Buon Giorno in Grapevine is amazing, as well as Oak Cliff Roasters in South Dallas. Oh yeah, and Twisted Root burgers in both Bedford and Roanoke!"

LONESTAR,3axbip,COHDUH,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:08:44 2015 UTC,"In Dallas:   ""El Si Hay"", in Bishop Arts, for authentic Mexican Tacos. Any of these places has heavenly BBQ: Hard 8 (Copell) Lockheart's (Bishop Arts) Pecan Lodge (Deep Ellum).   And I make a mean pull pork, but you're not invited."

LONESTAR,3axbip,seang91,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:43:52 2015 UTC,It expanded to San Marcos - not sure about Waco.   Loco Pollo and Fuego steak are a stupid kinda good
LONESTAR,3axbip,DracoPhage,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:29:16 2015 UTC,Going through Houston you should try Bubbas Texas Burger Shack for a mouth drooling buffalo burger.
LONESTAR,3axbip,Kerwin15,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:25 2015 UTC,DFW - check out the stock yard in Ft. Worth.  Also there's an italian place called Napoli's. It's so great.   If you want a rooftop experience that's pretty cool try Gator's.
LONESTAR,3axbip,20TL12III,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:30:36 2015 UTC,Black Meg 43 in Killeen for some of the tastiest burgers you'll ever lay hands on.
LONESTAR,3axbip,ChokeZero,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:51:24 2015 UTC,Dallas.  Wingfield's Breakfast and Burgers on Beckley for a burger.  Emilio's Cafe on Ervay for breakfast tacos.
LONESTAR,3axbip,thatmeddlingkid7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:37:38 2015 UTC,"Here in the DFW area, the best hole in the wall restaurants I know are Angelo's (barbecue), Charlie's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, and Fred's Texas Cafe (best burgers, fries, chips and queso ever). Also Mama's Pizza. Fucking love Mama's. In Denton I'd recommend Bagheri's in Denton. Don't be thrown off by the Lesbian bar or hookah lounge on either side. It's the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy. In fact, it beats a lot of Italian food I had in Italy. Just be careful with the owner. It's one of those places where the customer isn't always right, and if you complain he may throw you out. Like seriously. He's a cool guy, but I would avoid criticizing him.  Edit: Also Conan's Pizza in Austin. Holy shit that's the best deep dish pizza I've ever had. Kicks Uno's ass any day of the week.  Edit2: Completely forgot Youngblood's Cafe at the Amarillo stockyards. Got featured on Man v Food once and holy shit it has the best chicken fried steak I've ever had."

We didn't lose shit, we just agreed to an alright temporary deal. On a good day you'd need at least 10 of their flags to equal one of ours. You think those Isis goat fuckers ever heard of West Virginia or Georgia? Hell no! This state scares the hell out of them. One security guard with a 9mm pistol took out 2 men with assault rifles. Let's see those peach farmers pull that shit off. FUCK YEAH TEXAS."
