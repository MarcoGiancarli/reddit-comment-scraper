steamdeals,3e1cxy,ABOOD-THE-PLAYER,6,Tue Jul 21 05:09:34 2015 UTC,Anything worth getting?
steamdeals,3dxodx,Roger2564,4,Mon Jul 20 11:42:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, those reviews are not very forgiving."
steamdeals,3dxodx,TypicalLibertarian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"""Uninstall works""   Lost my shit.  User who submitted this is a month-old redditor with only one other submission... which is another instance of this game being on sale. Apparently ""having trading cards"" make it worth buying? Oh and of course the game has been in Early Access for almost a year.  Hilarious. :B"
steamdeals,3dxodx,BoreasBlack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:57 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but it's filling a gap that something like counterstrike already fills very well. To a certain extent, dirty bomb too, as the cards tend to have little impact on the wider game balance."
steamdeals,3diyfz,ABOOD-THE-PLAYER,4,Thu Jul 16 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"so is Alien:Isolation worth it for $12.49?    I love stealth genre stuff (think Thief, Dishonored, etc.. )  Is the replay value there after giving it a once through?"
steamdeals,3diyfz,warriorpriest,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"This sounds like ""Outlast"". I couldn't finish it as i was stuck but i like the tension however i often wished i would have been able to fight back instead of running away. Purchased!"
steamdeals,3diyfz,t0shki,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you only have a video camera that features night vision. No weapons or anything. You are constantly low on batteries, so you have to look for spares and if they are out you are in trouble. For the majority of the game you are constantly chased by some sort of psycho-hulk and you are dead as soon as he gets to you. You have to hide a lot and peek around before making a move. Also because everything is so dark you can't just walk around aimlessly.   I am currently playing A:I and while not being chased yet, i see that it follows the same concept of reading documents, listening to old reports and search for passages while being in constant fear for your life."
steamdeals,3diyfz,t0shki,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely worth it. Hands down, everything I wanted from an Alien game. And if you like sneaking, well, here it's not only recommended, it's essential.   As for replay, the missions and story will be the same, but the Alien itself will definitely keep you on your toes. There are also some levels that can be downloaded that are independent from the rest of the game, but still give you something new."
steamdeals,3diyfz,RimmyMcJob,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:18 2015 UTC,Are those separate levels the DLC in the season pass?  Is that a significant amount of content?  I guess it's not story content?
steamdeals,3diyfz,ForerEffect,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:46 2015 UTC,"Most are in the season pass, but there are two (which feature some of the original movie's cast) that are not included. Each of them are their own little self-contained story that only tangentially connects to the main campaign. All together they add a few more hours of playtime, but honestly, even if you didn't get them, it wouldn't hamper the main story. I mean, the campaign itself took me damn near 20 hours, which seems to be a pretty rare thing nowadays. (Granted, that was a lot of time spent hiding in lockers, but still...)"
steamdeals,3diyfz,RimmyMcJob,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"I have a love/hate thing going on with this game. The atmosphere is amazing and the game is really fun, until the alien shows up. Then for me at least, the whole thing grinds to a halt. If the alien sees you you're dead, no matter what difficulty you play on, and it's so unpredictable it might as well be random. It's scary the first few times, but the saves are so far apart that often you will have to go back and redo the last 10-15 minutes, including all the little scripted cut-scene things. There was one 5-10 minute section that I literally had to re-do a dozen times over. And at that point it starts to just get more frustrating than scary. Instead of being like ""Oh shit, the Alien is here!"" I found myself being more like ""Oh lame, here we go again."" Eventually I just quit, I couldn't do it anymore. I like a difficult game, but sometimes this one felt like it would randomly punish you for no reason and make you redo huge chunks.   NB: This is just my personal experience. Lots of other people really like the game, and I'm almost certainly in the minority."
steamdeals,3dixur,ABOOD-THE-PLAYER,2,Thu Jul 16 17:21:17 2015 UTC,"amazing deal, been wanting to play this game for months lol"
steamdeals,3dixur,YeezyCop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:09:32 2015 UTC,So how do I tell if I need the upgrade?
steamdeals,3dixur,ManlyBeardface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"hmm.... ok, I will bite."
steamdeals,3d9x67,ABOOD-THE-PLAYER,4,Tue Jul 14 17:19:16 2015 UTC,Ugh.  I already have Crusader Kings 2 and wanted to pick up some of the expansions that add actual content and not just graphic changes.  But it seems the actual DLC isn't on sale.
steamdeals,3d9x67,beepsy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"Haha I just impulse bought the whole shebang. I have no idea what this game is, but I'm jazzed."
steamdeals,3d9x67,PolarisC8,2,Wed Jul 15 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"lol I admire your moxy, but be warned that CK2 isn't exactly 'pick up and play'"
steamdeals,3d9x67,JeffMcBiscuit,0,Wed Jul 15 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"I spent 35 minutes in the tutorial before something went wrong, so I went to bed. I shall try again today."
steamdeals,3d9x67,PolarisC8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"I was planning on buying the complete collection while it's on sale, BUT it looks like a bunch of DLC is missing from the package.  What gives?  If I buy this game, what DLC is a must-have or just really, really great?"
steamdeals,3d9x67,BrassBass,2,Wed Jul 15 07:48:13 2015 UTC,"I put over 150 hours into the base game (well, technically with three cosmetic DLCs that came with the bundle), so I can say the game is definitely enjoyable without DLC, at least if you are OK with playing Christian rulers in Europe."
steamdeals,3d9x67,Dahlerus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:50 2015 UTC,"I played the demo, and got half-way through the tutorial.  I only have a partial grasp on what to do and how.  The screen also takes up too much space for the menus and UI, so it is hard to stay on task without getting lost in the various tools.  Is the full version different, layout-wise?"

steamdeals,3cr4kb,spmaloney,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:24:00 2015 UTC,how is this game?
steamdeals,3cr4kb,ObersV,3,Fri Jul 10 03:22:52 2015 UTC,It is lots of fun for the first few hours you play it but after the whole 'OMG IM FUCKING SHARK' phase passes it is really only fun when you play with your friends. But my god when you play with your friends on Skype or whatever it is fucking amazing.
steamdeals,3cr4kb,spmaloney,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Yeah, I bet it is, what an amazing concept"
steamdeals,3cr4kb,ObersV,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:55:07 2015 UTC,"I find this game fun, but I feel like it is the kind of game that will be a multiplayer wasteland after the free weekend."
steamdeals,3cr4kb,seanshoots,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:47 2015 UTC,Nah.  I own the game and I never have problems getting matches.
steamdeals,3cr4kb,noktiis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"Fun, but the actual game starts after a lot of menus and waiting and it crashes very often. EDIT: Actually this game is awesome, minus the crashes that is. Best 8 euro I spent this month."
steamdeals,3cr4kb,elpresidente-4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"Since its free, it's definitely worth checking out. I've played 2 hours so far and at this point I would pay to buy it after the sale. However, I played with a group of 4 so I don't think that playing solo would be as fun."
steamdeals,3cr4kb,njost25,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"I played solo for an hour or so last night, and I found it pretty fun. Kinda quiet though with no in-game messaging (other than the select wheel)  I think it would be much better with a group though."
steamdeals,3cr4kb,snootchie_bootch,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:14:41 2015 UTC,there is in game voice chat. I believe the button is key bound to K or something stupid.
steamdeals,3cr4kb,spmaloney,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think it defaults to T, but I haven't seen anyone use it"
steamdeals,3cr4kb,seanshoots,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"Well if so, nobody in the games I played last night used it."
