A Member of Parliament took his family to the beach. There was a toilet of more or less of the same type you desribed. His wife went there and soon was warned by other women that inside there seems to be a man with a flashlight attached to his head. A MoP went around the building and found a hole leading below the building with a wooden door, then shouted for the man to come out, but nothing happened. Meanwhile his daughter found a spycam covered by moss. When MoP went to inspect the camera, the guy made a bolt, MoP and another bypasser tried to catch him but to no avail. On his way back home he spotted a similar looking guy on ferry, so he told the police which then took the guy for identification in order to match his fingerprints on the spycam (and the second spycam which was found in the toilet by the police). However, if I remember correctly, it appeared it's not the same guy."

LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,GeminiGabRiElleSG,9,Mon Jul 20 17:59:02 2015 UTC,"Was it a 24-hour store? If not, you might have just gotten there as they were closing, even if not, some places will lock the door at close to prevent more customers, and then let whoever is in out when they get done, or for a half hour while they clean the store.  The receipt comes out of the register itself on newer models, not the card reader.  Him being unattractive shouldn't make you think he is more dangerous. Looks have nothing to do with criminal behavior or propensity toward violence. It's pretty rude of you to suspect someone's motives solely on the basis of them not being hot, life isn't a movie where the bad guys have exaggerated ""ugly"" characteristics so that people who have trouble reading people's actions can follow along without getting confused."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,LittlestBeastie,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:10 2015 UTC,This is what I was thinking. I'm just imagining some poor guy doing his job when some crazy chick pushes him out of her way and runs through the door.
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,neva-electra,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, on the off chance the person was actually in a dangerous situation, a life might have been saved there. Eh, I can't blame OP for getting the heck out of there..."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,PlatypusPerson,2,Tue Jul 21 02:55:36 2015 UTC,"Some stores lock their doors after a certain time for safety reasons. At the store near my house the door is locked after 11pm, they buzz you in and out of the store. They do this to prevent robberies, the store has a buzzer so you don't actually see it being locked. I live in an extremely safe neighborhood where the last robbery (of a store not sure about a house) was like 3 years ago. They still do this so it's not uncommon.   I get the door wasn't locked when OP walked in so this situation may be less likely."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,spladarpidus,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:09 2015 UTC,"I think it has less to do with the looks as the creepy vibe she got from the men. Also, if they were just closing and she wanted to leave, since she wasn't carrying out the items, they would have just let her go. Not to mention that if she was the only person in the store and they were going to close, they would not have locked up while she was paying if they were just going to have to unlock it again in a few seconds when her transaction completed. They would have just waited a few seconds for her to leave first."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,AirAdmiral,0,Tue Jul 21 06:33:49 2015 UTC,Not really true. At my store we would not kick the customers out but would lock the doors so no new customers could come in. When a customer would leave we would unlock the doors.
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,rOOb85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:15:55 2015 UTC,"I would normally agree, but if you have one customer less than a minute away from finishing (card is swiped, just waiting on receipt) you would lock the door, wait 45 seconds and unlock it and lock it again? Also, out of curiosity, don't you have to have the doors able to open from the inside at all times in case of fire? Like no one can come in but you can go out in an emergency situation?"
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,AirAdmiral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"Yea. If you have ever worked retail you'll know nothing is worse then working 8+ hours and having customers keep walking in at close. Especially if you are the only store open in the area, people know when you close and you can actually get a rush of people minuets before close.   The doors at my store had a lock on the outside and a switch/dial thing on the inside. If you locked the doors they would not open. The doors did have special hinges where if you where inside the door and slammed into the door hard they would unhinge. This is in case the automatic doors malfunction."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,rOOb85,2,Tue Jul 21 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"Dude a person working there wouldn't start locking the door when no one else was around except a lone female(?). If it wasn't a 24 gas station, at least in my area they never have two people closing.  Sounds like the clerk was just a drug addict with jaundice maybe from hep C from the yellow spots she described in his eyes."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,mrbitchtitz,3,Tue Jul 21 10:39:58 2015 UTC,I should have done this when i worked at 7 11. Just a prank to keep customers away.

LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,CaptainCipher,14,Tue Jul 21 08:07:00 2015 UTC,locking a door is a crime now?
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,lolucantsk8,17,Tue Jul 21 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"This story reads a lil differently if you're female versus male. People should REALLY put their gender at the start of these stories, it really affects the reading of the story and reading the possible motive of the people involved.."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,banister,6,Mon Jul 20 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"I don't think it reads differently depending on the gender. Unless it's merely terrifying and absolutely terrifying. I mean, even if OP is male, that's a damn scary situation."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,Harbingerofmeh,14,Mon Jul 20 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"Because the intent is most likely rape if it's a female but less likely if male (possibly just robbery). Yes it's possible it's rape too if the OP is male, but IMO far less likely."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,banister,9,Mon Jul 20 20:54:42 2015 UTC,Which is fucked up. Anyone can be a perpetrator or a victim.
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,LittlestBeastie,0,Mon Jul 20 21:05:36 2015 UTC,"but the intent is often different...say for example the OP writes ""The man behind the counter gives me a disgusting evil grin""  if the OP is a 16 year old girl, i'd probably infer the guy intends rape, if the OP is a 65 year old MAN i'd probably infer the intends robbery or murder. Context is useful for interpretation, and the age/gender of the OP provides useful context."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,banister,-4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:46 2015 UTC,"Also, an assaulted regular male of, say, 30, is more likely to have a fighting chance (than 16 yo girl). On the other hand, it might hint that the perpetrators might be prepared well, maybe have weapons or smth."

You can still leave if you're an employee, especially common with security systems. Maybe they were just closing up shop. Maybe you scared the ever living piss out of them?  Boss: Melvin, what happened, why is this door pane cracked and why are there groceries everywhere?  Melvin: Uh, Jimmy and I were closing up last night and this girl just went nuts and wrecked the place.  Boss: You didn't sell her any potpourri did you?  Melvin: What?  Boss: Nothing."
LetsNotMeet,3dyqat,agouti23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:43:49 2015 UTC,"Op was right to follow her instincts. It's better that the two employees were shocked or insulted by her reaction (which they would likely forget by the next day anyway) than to have ignored her instincts and have God knows what happen.   Instincts are there for a reason, yes, sometimes they are wrong, but it's better safe than sorry.  It's comments like this that make people ignore their intuition and do what the suspicious person wants for fear of overreacting or offending them. That is dangerous."

LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,taiyed311,4,Tue Jul 21 00:11:20 2015 UTC,"I would have called the cops, but they weren't technically on my property. My driveway is on the far side of my property, right up next to the property line. That's how the could be at the corner of my house, but not actually trespassing. And they were right on that line.  And yeah, I'm actually planning to install security cameras as soon as I have the funds. I'm nervous enough being home alone without my neighbors pulling crap like this. I need to record around my house."
LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,CatzAgainstHumanity,6,Tue Jul 21 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"Pull out your phone and do or pretend you are recording say your boyfriend told you to do it why he is away.

He should know what they are too."" Oh, and I record from inside the house too, when you are on my property. Do it the minute you get out of your car or go outside so it looks like you could tape them at any moment."

LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,Mrs_Fonebone,5,Tue Jul 21 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"girlfriend, that's harassment. the cops can't really do anything but they would probably give them a stern talking to, depending on the attitude of the police where you live and whether these folks have been in trouble before. it sucks because you haven't done anything wrong, and i'm sure you don't want to feel like you've been intimidated into it - but, are you renting? can you move? i'd get the hell out of there before they do something crazier. good luck <3"
LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,Mrs_Fonebone,3,Tue Jul 21 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right.   I don't rent. I bought the house. I have to live somewhere. I do plan to move anyway, but that's still years down the line. I hindsight, I do see why the previous owners were so eager to sell in a hurry; it was a very fast closing.   I think they might be moving though. I'm not sure. They haven't actually said they were, but the man said ""as long as we're here"" when he was talking at me that night, which makes me think they might be planning a move some time. I might just be reading too much into it."
LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,theMediatrix,4,Tue Jul 21 00:30:22 2015 UTC,"Don't interact or speak with them at all but do record visually or on tape. If you don't engage with them--and yes they ARE doing this on purpose to mess with you--they will probably get more blatant and allow you to file a police report.  Never read anything at your mailbox. Take everything inside quickly.  What they're doing is harassment. You can deal with that by documenting it, then going to a magistrate to see if it qualifies for a no-contact order.  Are you in an townhouse type community renting? Did you buy? If not, speak to your landlord.   You can get fake security cameras attached to the corners of the house. You don't know that they're harmless; at the very least they are insensitive pains  in the rump. Your instincts are telling you that this is not normal. It isn't.  If you chat with the police or a community officer, you may find that other people have complained about them. Good luck with that!"
LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,NovelistResearcher,4,Tue Jul 21 00:32:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think completely refusing to interact from now on is the way to go.  I bought the house. I'm kind of stuck with them, at least for now.   I will definitely be documenting everything now.  I don't really know any of the other neighbors, so I don't know if they've had problems with these people as well or not. Although, judging from the weird note, it seems the previous owners definitely did.  I'm going to make sure to record all of this now.  Thanks."
LetsNotMeet,3e07ru,littlemeowbeast,4,Tue Jul 21 00:39:21 2015 UTC,Good luck to you--it's a terrible situation. You should be able to look at the deed and see who had the house before you---it would be worth talking to them!

My husband and I eventually had to get a restraining order, which they immediately violated. Also, be prepared for there to be even more problems if you film them with your phone. They will act as though YOU are harassing them, but the footage will show the truth. Surveillance cameras installed on your house would be better. Good luck and stay safe."

LetsNotMeet,3dym3s,Nymxy,0,Mon Jul 20 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"A>As I just posted my first mildly creepy encounter on Reddit, I remembered another one, which was way more life threatening.    When I was a freshman my friends and I would go to a nice bar in the city centre (a pretty safe place). One winter night (around 2 am) after a few drinks I felt quite sleepy and decided to go home, but told no one about it, since I knew others would persuade me to stay for more drinks (normally I would never go home alone). So I went out and called a taxi. The operator told me a red VW Passat would pick me up in about ten minutes. I stood outside waiting, it was snowing heavily and I was really cold. The taxi was not coming.  After about ten minutes a big blue taxi car (have no idea what the brand was) stopped next to me and the driver rolled down his window. He asked me where I was going (I should have realised the taxi I called would know my address). Being tipsy and all I told him my address. He told me to get in the car (again, I was drunk, and even if I would never get into a stranger‘s car while being sober, I didn‘t think about the worst that could happen at that time). I got in the back and we took off. Quickly I realised there was someone sitting next to the driver in the passenger‘s seat. It was a man in his 40s (just like the driver). They were talking w?here should they go and mentioned a street that was nowhere near my home. The driver‘s friend said they should go to that street since he has a young female friend there and „WE ALL could have some fun“. I thought I‘m in a big mess.  Then the driver‘s friend turned to me and asked if I wanted some vodka (he had a bottle in his hand). I declined and turned my head to the you‘re ++dow. Upon close :-Pr inspection of me the friend said: „My my my...  young“. He sounded pleased. (I was 19 at that time, but seemed 15-16). I started asking them to stop the car and let me out, I could walk home on foot (even though I had no idea where we were because of the heavy snow). They assured me I would get home eventually. I shrugged and started sobbing quietly while they were making plans where should they go. My only thoughts were that I‘m going to die and my friends and family have no idea where I am. I asked them several more times to let me go, but they just kept making their planas.  I s obered up a bit and realised I couldn’t fight them off if I had to (since I’m a 1,62 m and 5 5 kg female), the only thing I could do was run. And I did. I waited till the car sto-pped at red light, opened the door and ran as fast as I could to some suburban area. As I left the car behind me I heard them shouting “Hey, bitch! Pay for your ride!!!” It took me an hour to walk back home on foot.   And even though it was my own fault ending up in that car, creeps pretending to be a taxi, let’s NEVER meet again.

LetsNotMeet,3dz7tm,beebeebop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing.. it never hurts to call the police. Keep the non emergency number saved in your phone and use that. That's what they're there for. I find a lot of people don't ""know when to call police"" .. well, if you feel threatened or if it's what will make you feel better in a situation, then call. It will never hurt. Even to let them know a description of someone or even just let your cell phone sit there and not say a thing so they can trace the call.. do it.   I take my cell phone everywhere. Even in my own home. I literally, and I mean literally have it on me at all times. Not out of I'm addicted to my phone.. but honestly, if you go to the bathroom and leave your phone in the livingroom and someone breaks in.. well, you've got a problem. However, if your phone is with you, you can call someone right away while locking yourself in a room. Just call me paranoid polly."

LetsNotMeet,3dyzji,AmericanSaddlebred,5,Mon Jul 20 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a woman too, and I hate to think you'd stop walking because of this incident, which you handled pretty well. I walk all the time, and I love walking. Just bear in mind some safety tips. As you already realized, don't wear headphones. Be aware of your surroundings. Choose places and times that feel safe. I'm always aware of what I would do if I felt uncomfortable--are there people around? Are there houses nearby you could knock on the door of if you were desperate? Or businesses you could go into? Do you have your (charged up) phone with you so you can call 911?   I don't make eye contact generally, and if I do, I make it extremely brief. If someone tries to talk to me who I am in any way not OK with (and this is my entirely subjective judgment, and I don't second-guess myself), I ignore them/pretend not to hear them, or if absolutely necessary say something to avoid them and put them off such as ""No, thanks,"" or ""I'm in a hurry."" I'm not rude, just firm and businesslike. If someone starts acting weird or following too close, or if I feel uncomfortable, I casually adjust my route or go into a store."
LetsNotMeet,3dyzji,MuseCo,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"Eye contact (direct or indirect based on the situation) is actually encouraged in most incidents with a possible threat. It lets the potential predator know that you are aware of and see him/her, it conveys confidence and assertiveness that may deter him/her (they may be looking for a target who is timid and/or less likely to defend themselves), and it obviously provides you with a physical description to provide the police if need be. I'm sure people will disagree with me, but wanted to share what I've learned from self-defense classes I have taken."

If you don't like guns, then get pepper spray and aways carry a box cutter. Gelding is not hard, a few swipes and the perv will back off, especially if you slice it off first.

LetsNotMeet,3dw9a1,BusinessofShow,3,Mon Jul 20 12:39:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never saw him near the university so I assumed that he was just someone who lived in the town.

LetsNotMeet,3dw9a1,shinkleboutit,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:24 2015 UTC,That was my first guess as well. A friend of mine went there (I went to IUP). Halloween at OU was always so much fun. Too bad weirdos have to ruin it.
LetsNotMeet,3dw9a1,iminyourfacejonson,2,Tue Jul 21 04:32:41 2015 UTC,Wtf so he never lunged at other cars just yours? And by lunge are we talking almost touching your car lunge?

The shooting that occurred in my neighborhood happened in 2002 when I was four going on five. What I should've put was that this wasn't the only shooting he'd been in. He's been in multiple shootings and the one at the apartments just happened to be another one that the cops arrested him for. He didn't get much time since the guy he shot didn't die.  Also, I'd like to add that I read the article when it first came out in 2013, when I was fifteen and this was a completely different shooting. This shooting is on the other side of town, where I now live.   Sorry for not further explaining it...."

There are a lot of road ragers in my general area, but this guy was the worst I've ever encountered. I still, to this day, can't figure out why he didn't pass me when he had the chance and then chose to pass me when it was illegal! And then to keep blocking me instead of just driving away. He looked like a mostly normal guy, well-kept and put-together, but his behavior is that of a psychopath or drug addict. I'm just glad I've never encountered him again!"

Sounds bad, but he threatened me for parking on a public street where he wanted to park, so I feel better knowing where he is and what he's up to.  Its scary easy to track someone down these days with how connected and exposed we are on the internet.   I won't sink to this man's level and retaliate, but knowing where he lives and works makes me feel safer so I can avoid those places in the future of need be."

LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,Kiwi-98,13,Sun Jul 19 14:42:39 2015 UTC,"Good thing you spotted his watch. It's a pretty well known trick to get someone's phone out in the open, so that they can grab your phone and run off. Most likely he wouldn't have touched you - sounds like an amateur since he still had a watch on. Either he would've grabbed your phone and ran, or if you had put up a struggle he might've run off without it anyway."

LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,Kirschkernkissen,-3,Mon Jul 20 12:23:40 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a massiv difference between not seeing it at all and only not clearly.   Sounds sadly just like another exaggerated story."
LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,TurquoiseRodox,2,Mon Jul 20 12:39:28 2015 UTC,Why exaggerated? I actually thought about posting that a long time because I still think it's not horriffic enough compared to all these other stories on here
LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,Kirschkernkissen,0,Mon Jul 20 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"Because it appears to be too boring by itself, so that you (maybe unconscious) tried to make it a bit more creepy with what you claim to have seen in his face.

LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,Kirschkernkissen,0,Mon Jul 20 10:15:42 2015 UTC,At least it's pretty strange to recognise such specific facial expressions without enough light to see the face by itself.
LetsNotMeet,3du6ra,ilkikuinthadik,2,Mon Jul 20 11:38:42 2015 UTC,"not really, humans are generally good at reading facial expressions and some are better than other, so certain things can give off emotions. like you can tell if someone is feeling negatively if you only see their mouth and its frowning but you can't see the rest of their face.  and people also read body language subconsciously, meaning that OP might have noticed the guy slumping his shoulders down, and remembered it simply as ""looking disappointed"" and not specifically as ""his shoulder slumped down."" OP is recounting this story from several years ago it sounds like, so its natural to not have every detail exact."

I don't try to slag OP, it's just something I see happening in LNM with increased regularity.  Edit: As I wrote the post you're replying to, OP hasn't had explained yet that he wanted to say that he meant ""not clearly"" instead of ""not at all"", so I don't really understand the downboat-army."

As far as what my feminist mother and counselor said to dickbutt principal, I don't know specifics but from what I've heard, they ripped him a new asshole and even threatened a lawsuit. In my opinion, they should have gone through with it. I'd like to think it taught him a thing or two but honestly, who knows? Stupid is as stupid does."

LetsNotMeet,3duyol,chronicheadbang,3,Sun Jul 19 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"No idea. I had a principal once in elementary who tried to tell me that an ""inappropriate"" picture from the internet I sent someone (because it was a hilarious picture), was cyber bullying.  Actually, when I remember all the principals that I've had, most of them seemed to come across as a little slow."

It's sad that there are many good people out there in the world, but the bad ones make it so hard for us to trust them. On another note, in 5th grade on the way home from school a fellow student pulled a knife on me and tried to take my bike. A crew happened to be working on a roof at the house we were in front of and they told the kid to leave me alone. This was a new kid at our school who was there because he was kicked out of three other schools in our town. My mom called the police and school. The principal blamed me and said the kid told her it was a rubber knife and that i was elaborating. I spent the rest of the year not making any clubs or teams i had made for years because she had a say in the decisions."

LetsNotMeet,3dsois,Creeped-,30,Sun Jul 19 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Long shot here, but the police could check the CCTV on some places where those pictures were taken. If the person was following you the day you went to the park, for instance, they could try to watch tapes from places you walked by on the way to the exact moment the creepy stalker photographed you. In case the pic was taken from behind, not from like a long distance. But of course the police will never do that, so I say be careful. Go to them anyway."
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,pepperonic,12,Sun Jul 19 03:11:15 2015 UTC,I do think they would look at the CCTV for sure. I will mention it to them. In places like the movie theater or the mall it would be the best bet to find out who this person is.
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,JpeTheGent44,18,Sun Jul 19 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"You may not have noticed the person following you because it may have been numerous people.

LetsNotMeet,3dsois,JpeTheGent44,15,Sun Jul 19 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"Yep that is totally possible, also could explain how I or my girlfriend never noticed the same person always around us if it was multiple people."

If it's a drone, it might be a hint to whom it belongs (typ etc) and if you're able to affort toys like a small head cam (Edit: like a go pro) or borrow it, you could film who walks behind you.  Sorry, just going full conan here.  Also there is a thing called mirror foil which you can apply to your window making it way more difficult to look inside, especially with electronic devices."

LetsNotMeet,3dsois,Littlemonster93,4,Sun Jul 19 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Christ, that is genuinely terrifying. Worth trying to find out who it is for sure. If this is someone who's following you in theaters and public restrooms and stuff, why not make a point of going to the bathroom whenever you're out, making it obvious where you're going, but then waiting somewhere to see if anyone else follows you out. Could work at the movies or whatever, then keep an eye out for patterns."
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,Littlemonster93,4,Sun Jul 19 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"This is awful. I really hope the police work hard to find out who is doing this to you and your girlfriend. Like others here have said, be very observant of your surroundings from now on. If you are able, it wouldn't hurt to invest in some security measures, even if it's just a nanny cam that can watch your front door. There is no telling how much further this person(s) might take their stalking. I really hope this creep is found so you and your girlfriend can feel safe again."
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,Gezza18,7,Sun Jul 19 19:06:36 2015 UTC,Right now this person doesn't know that you know somebody is stalking you.   Use that to your advantage while you can. Be extra vigilant without being obvious. Don't look suspicious but be very aware of everybody around you. Start noticing if you're seeing the same person regularly. Note any distinguishing features that person may have.
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,alamakjan,4,Sun Jul 19 11:06:40 2015 UTC,Obviously the people who do this know since they tell the girlfriend to open that forum.
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,alamakjan,4,Sun Jul 19 17:44:13 2015 UTC,Yes you're right. I missed that. Maybe the anonymous guy who messaged her just recognised her pictures and wanted to let her know but that is of course a very long shot.
LetsNotMeet,3dsois,CatzAgainstHumanity,3,Sun Jul 19 20:44:47 2015 UTC,You might be able to find out what camera was used through the data in the digital file. Not sure how/if that would help but just a thought.

LetsNotMeet,3dsois,lt__,2,Sun Jul 19 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'd think it has to do with the anonymous guy sending the link to your girlfriend, did he threaten your girlfriend? I hear stories about guys leak nudes or sex tape of their girlfriends after the break up. or it might be some girl your girlfriend had really bad argument or fight with doing this out of revenge or jealousy, though I think it's less likely but who knows there are some really fucked up people out there.

Half of them just do it to fleece tourists and charge a billion pounds for a 5 min journey, but there are always the less well-intentioned drivers out there.  It's possible this guy was listening in via a CB radio and waiting for a single male or someone he could overpower, knowing they wouldn't look too closely at his car if they were expecting a cab."

The other thing that really stands out to me, looking back, is how nervous he was about everything; I have social anxiety so I tend to be kind of awkward around new people but lemme tell you, this guy was jittery as all get out. I can only hope at this point that it was his first attempt on a person, because the junk in his bag looked new (duct tape still was saran wrapped-sealed) but that's not a guarantee.  If my parents or my grandmother had known about what happened I would have never been allowed back to their place and since my birth mom is a total nutter, I would have never heard the end of it. If it wasn't for the condoms, my grandfather and I could have written it off as a confused poacher; they bury their kill remains similarly to body dumps and we find deer bones (yes we're 100% certain they're deer, I've never encountered a human being with hooves or fur) wrapped in garbage bags buried in the woods occasionally. A decent amount of hunters will gut, skin, bleed and cut deer before transporting the meat, if that's what they were there for, simply cause it's easier to move around. A 100 lb deer is stupidly heavy and ungainly; 40 lbs of meat that's been wrapped neatly in garbage bags and that you've dissected on a tarp so you didn't leave any blood stains behind.... isn't.  It's just the condoms and the creepiness of the chainsaw, and the fact that... well, the guy wasn't /dressed/ like a hunter that seems really, really off to me. In typing all that out, I guess it is possible that the guy was going to meet other poachers, one or more of which he was going to sleep with (you /can/ get an offroad-style car up the service road at least as far as our property line goes, I'm not sure about the reserve behind it but the rangers could keep it maintained). We've got bears, as well as some truly massive bucks, as well as a few rare birds and snakes so it's not impossible that he saw his friend's chainsaw in the clearing, or thought the guy took it, or was as high as balls and confused. I don't know.  There haven't been any unexplained disappearances here that I've heard of (my grandfather reads the local papers) since so I'm just going to hope that he was just moving through, or was a confused poacher who was on his way to have sex with someone."
LetsNotMeet,3dst4p,TheBestVirginia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"You could look and see if there are any missing persons reports from that area and time frame, just in case.  Also, this is a weird thought but maybe he was in to bestiality or even necrophiliac bestiality?  You're right, the condoms are the thing that really stands out in that duffle bag.  This is a really creepy story, I'm surprised it doesn't have more points.  It's one of the creepier stories I've read here lately!  One other point about missing persons: I think you could search by the city, county, or state (depending on what jurisdiction in which they were reported) or try a site like charleyproject.org or NAMUS."
LetsNotMeet,3dst4p,throw_away_loompa,5,Sun Jul 19 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I have no idea what he was into. We tend to get our fair share of weirdos- a guy approached me once when I was in the woods and said that if I wasn't ""a doe"" I'd make ""one hell of a trophy"". There was also a thing in our community where some high school boys got caught having sex with farm animals. So like, I wouldn't honestly be surprised if the guy was out in the woods poaching or screwing animals, or even that he /did/ see a chainsaw that looked like the one we were using from his vantage point that I couldn't see, but it was just... the combination of things; he wasn't dressed for a long outdoors trip, wasn't carrying any other gear that I could see, and most of all, why did he run off when my granddad appeared?  I guess poaching could be a legit answer to the whole thing, and I do know people use condoms for things other than sex (waterproofing, primarily), so it's possible the whole thing is just the World's Worst Misunderstanding. Like, guy coulda been in the woods with his buddies and doing Bad Things and just doubled back to help a young girl out but still.... Creepy.  I'm going to do that later tonight (the online searching) when I get a chance."
LetsNotMeet,3dst4p,Imstephalee,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:28 2015 UTC,"She did say ""around"" 2012, so maybe she mixed up her dates? That would be insane if that's who she saw!"

LetsNotMeet,3dst4p,IRelishPickles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that nothing happened to you buy why wouldn't you call the police? I know they probably wouldn't have been able to do anything with the evidence you had, and may not have even filed a report; however, just having a handful of officers aware of this character around the area is important."
LetsNotMeet,3dst4p,ClockworkFate,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:12:17 2015 UTC,"Mostly because there were other things going on at the time that would have made any sort of police contact super, super complicated. Both my parents are lawyers and were going through a super messy divorce and wouldn't have wanted me to talk to the police without one or both of them present and that wasn't possible without several screaming matches, even more therapy, and the high probability I'd never be allowed back to my grandparents' house again. And since that's where I camp(ed) out whenever my parents started throwing things at each other, my grandfather and I have always had the unspoken agreement that we do not ever mention anything ever to the police or to my parents (since talking to the police is, by extension, talking to my parents). I know it sounds kind of stupid but we're talking about people who are so completely irrational and unstable that, at the time, short of him having actually attacked me or threatened me, we decided that it wasn't worth the risk.   My grandfather did, however, go back out to the borders of our property and post clear signs every few feet saying that trespassers entered at their own risk; where we live, it's legal for property owners to put out animal traps on their own land if they're having a pest problem, as well as consider any trespassers a threat to their life/safety, which effectively means you can shoot them and get away with it. He spent the next few months teaching me how to fire, break down, load and unload, and clean a small handgun as well as a rifle, and I always carry one if I'm out and about. That won't do much to help if he goes on anyone else's land, but it did protect ours, and my grandfather did call the owners of a good number of the surrounding farms to tell them that a ""stranger"" had approached his granddaughter on his land and that he had seemed ""off"", so to be on their guard.   At the suggestion of another commenter I went through the missing persons lists for the area going back until 2010, as well as checked out newspaper articles, for our county and the few surrounding ones. It's a small, sleepy area and there aren't any unsolved murder cases of women under the age of 30, Jane Doe notices for girls around that age that haven't been claimed, or any ""weird"" deaths. Most of the deaths around here come from equipment or gun accidents, natural causes, or people who flip their cars into ditches or plow them into trees because they were drunk or swerving to avoid an animal. And the occasional snakebite. The only weird one I could find at all was a girl who hung herself in her family's barn, but the article said that her boyfriend had left her and she had been struggling with depression for a while so that sounds more explainable."
LetsNotMeet,3duewy,AVirtualDuck,4,Sun Jul 19 16:05:03 2015 UTC,"You really should have called the police. There would be no point on having to prove that you were right, it doesn' matter if only you saw it. Worst case scenario? You were wrong. The girl was probably in trouble..."

I'd consider it not only extremely incompetent and unprofessional that Peter was assigned to another female and that his paperwork wasn't up to date with these issues, but potentially criminally negligent.  Hopefully Peter is a harmless obsessive, but the potential for escalation into violence still existed.  At any rate, I'm glad you're okay, and hopefully someone (not female) was able to give Peter the help he needs."

LetsNotMeet,3dsvii,TehKatieMonster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:28:07 2015 UTC,I actually went to see a therapist regularly. I specifically asked for a man because women scare me.

LetsNotMeet,3dsvii,TehKatieMonster,2,Mon Jul 20 00:27:55 2015 UTC,"See, that is something I was taught never to do- give out info about myself. Self disclosure is not considered a useful tool as the relationship between counsellor and client cannot ever be considered 'equal' and thus there is an unfair bias. I have relaxed a lot since the early days but I still consider anything more than a tiny amount of self disclosure to be irrelevant and unhelpful in most situations"

LetsNotMeet,3dsczh,pepperonic,8,Sun Jul 19 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"It just goes to prove how easily people can fall into hypocrisy and double standards when it's about people who's ill.   I mean, if the guy was healthy, everyone would be ""OMG, he's a rapist! Go to the police!"" But he's so ill, so fragile, so disabled... then ""OMG, he's adorable! Look, he fell in love!""  People need to learn that even ill people can be creepy, dangerous, evil (not that I consider him evil, I know he's unstable, but there are other ill people who are evil or bitter about being ill), crazy, etc. It's something to blame on many countries' cultures and Hollywood / TV. Do you read TV Tropes? There's a trope called ""Littlest Cancer Pacient"", about diabetes-causing sweet little children (specially girls) who have cancer and it's soooo cuuuuuute and inspirational. So, I guess, people see Hollywood / TV's version of the ill / disabled people: cute, adorable, inspirational, harmless, loving, wise, down to earth people who have so much to teach us, etc. and when they see a real ill / disabled person they think that person is just like the one who appeared in the ""inspirational"" movie they just watched.  My mom gave personal info because she was sucked in the ""Oh, poor thing"" black hole. My country is big in that.

I had a meltdown of such fucktastic proportions (I remember I screamed at my mom nothing but ""what the fucking fuck"", ""you're insane"", ""what the hell is this shit"", ""this is fucking bullshit"", ""I'm the only fucking sane person around here"") that my dad got angry that was cursing like a sailor and said he was taking my laptop as he did so. I was red with anger, just said ""Uggggggggggh!"", and locked myself in my room while loudly closing my door (I was angry already and he took the laptop I use for programming). My dad screamed at me for being so rude and hysterical and left. My mom felt guilty and came clean.  Five minutes later my dad was back, returning the laptop with an ""I'm so sorry"" look on his face."

LetsNotMeet,3dp3tf,bonnie2796,9,Sat Jul 18 10:35:32 2015 UTC,Implying Australia doesn't have racism..
LetsNotMeet,3dp3tf,yodasears,6,Sat Jul 18 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"the n word isn't as commonly used in Australia, mostly just white kids using it to refer to their friends. We do have a lot of racism here but there's different terms that were used to refer to slaves and that's mostly how racists refer to our indigenous people. The n word isn't unknown here though so they might not have ever heard it referred to as the n word before."

LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,reddragonser,3,Sat Jul 18 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"I started role playing when I was young as well, not through AOL, but deviantArt and other websites. I was in a semi-similar situation where my RP partner (17-18) at the time) was fairly sexual to me (12-13) and while I wasn't comfortable with it, we never actually wrote about it. I was banned from RPing for a year when my parents found out, and it only occurred to me this year (now 19) that it's very possible that she could have been grooming me, or else have just thought (as many did in those chat rooms) that I was mature enough (I would write realistic gore, for example).  I still play with the idea of finding her and contacting her one day.. But whenever it seems I find her name attached to a role player, I back out and panic.  Anyway. I'm glad nothing happened to you! He could have been genuine... or so I thought until he said he lied about his age the second time. Alluding to where you lived could have been subtle hints to meet up with you, even innocently, but we'll never know."
LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,stlynn,3,Sat Jul 18 12:53:38 2015 UTC,"Same here! I was using a knock-off neopets site to roleplay and had an 18 (boy) and 16 (girl) year old ""teaching"" me about all that shit when I was like 12. Never thought it was weird until about a year ago when I thought about my ""friends"" again and how much I ""missed"" them until I realized the guy telling me he preferred a ""girl who shaves"" when I wasn't even old enough to shave my own legs wasn't the best."
LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,reddragonser,3,Sat Jul 18 20:27:10 2015 UTC,"I was on Marapets when I was 8-12! On and off, it's where I first started, then I found dA and met her. Yeaaah, kinda creepy! One of the things that sticks out of my mind was when she pressed a pedophilic RP relationship (when I was 13, this is after I built up trust) and had her character (50+ man) groom my character (6-10? Not sure, year old boy who he was stepfather of). I went with it because I didn't really understand how wrong it was, it made me feel super uncomfortable but I thought that if I refused I might lose her friendship (nowadays, I tell my RP partners what I refuse to do, it taught me that!). There was a point where her character asked the kid to get some certain 'beads'... I went along with it for a few minutes, then freaked out and decided to go to bed, and just ignored anything to do with that type of stuff again.  I know it sounds stupid of me, but I was a very sheltered kid, I didn't really understand sex or age or consent because the schools around me were crap, and this was one of my best friends during a time when I was bullied and an outcast. I really regret it. I feel sick that I even went along with it."
LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,DimDroog,4,Sat Jul 18 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"For Pete's sake, it was not stupid of you.   You were a kid.  Please don't blame yourself."
LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,reddragonser,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I just need to try and accept that it happened and can't change it now. I forgot about it for so long but my asexuality is seriously hampered by how I approach sex thanks to what happened (toys disgust me, even thinking about them, thanks to what her character constantly suggested for mine, etc)"
LetsNotMeet,3dpsmi,stlynn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Ah Marapets...I was on Anatheria/Kenopets (it changed names) and I actually just looked around because it reminds me of it.

I was sheltered too and I completely get it! Don't feel sick you went along with it! You didn't know any better! They obviously did!"

LetsNotMeet,3dlt9h,mischievousmonkey001,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:19 2015 UTC,"Here!  Does this help?  I've copied and pasted. 1) No fiction or paranormal stories. Real encounters with the living only, as we find the living more terrifying.  2) If your story focuses primarily on a rape or other assault, rather than on being stalked or creeped, your story will be removed.  3) Personal stories only.  4) Pseudonyms (fictional names) are required. However, don't tell the reader they are fictional, and don't use initials to refer to a person. Submissions that break this rule will be removed.  5) Don't be an asshole in the comments. Commenting and saying that someone should've been stalked or had it coming is absolutely not allowed.  6) This is a user-based community. If you believe a story is breaking the rules, report it to the mods so we can review it.  7) The mods will enforce these rules as they see fit."

Maybe he was locked up for a long time but you didn't mention it so I'll ask a couple questions. Why didn't your grandmother report this?  There had to be an arson investigation. I'm assuming he got locked up for a long ass time and you didn't feel it necessary to put that in there. At least I hope so, two counts of attempted murder and an arson charge should be a long fucking time in prison but with plea deals and shit I suppose he could've been released after 20-40 years even though he deserves to die.  Prosecutors shouldn't offer a plea deal to a sociopath who tried to burn his kids to death. Let the jury sentence him to life. I'm rambling now, he either disappeared or did serious jail time. Curious as to which one. Looking at your last line makes me think he disappeared after typing all that shit out.  Edit: I should've just asked what happened to him but I was typing my thoughts out."

LetsNotMeet,3dljv1,steffisaurus,6,Fri Jul 17 18:07:47 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that they were doing credit card scams. Apparently it's a common tactic for criminals to purchase things over the phone/online with stolen credit cards and have the goods delivered to a location that they have no official connection to, where they can intercept the packages. That way if the cops are tracking that card and go to the place where the stuff is being delivered all they'll find is some confused homeowner instead of the actual bad guy."

LetsNotMeet,3dk6o2,PancakePenguin,5,Fri Jul 17 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone blames the mental issues. Most people who have psychological issues don't act like that. I know quite a few and they're always quite nice people, bar when off their meds, and even then they're nothing like that.  It's not mental issues. I've known a few pedophiles in passing and they're sinister assholes. It's a deliberate choice for the most part (I've known only one who wasn't, and his mental issue is such that it's laughable to think that he could drive a car. He has trouble stopping himself from eating everything in the fridge and is for the most part a nice person - he just has severe issues controlling himself and that bleeds over in his sex life as well. He has no control at all and though he's never actually hurt anyone before, he has tried. That, though, isn't his fault and he's never deliberately tried to trick someone into going anywhere with him. He has no idea of planning - that is the realm of evil men, not sick minds.)"
LetsNotMeet,3dk6o2,silversatyr,0,Fri Jul 17 14:16:50 2015 UTC,"It's not blaming mental issues, it's because THEY DO have mental issues. Normal everyday people don't behave like this. These people have psychological problems like addictions that trigger them or have chemical imbalances which trigger these attacks. Don't try and spew crap when it's clearly a psychological problem they're dealing with."
LetsNotMeet,3dk6o2,Gezza18,2,Sat Jul 18 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Some do, which I pointed out, but the vast majority don't. You're basically saying that everyone who drinks does it because of mental issues. No, as with drinking, being a predator can be due to mental issues, however for the most part it is a conscious choice, brought on by a desire for power over another - usually the weak, helpless and defenceless, though not always (hence why even people who fight back can become targets for these fuckers). The majority of predators are not mentally disturbed and you give them an excuse out of their behaviour to believe such a thing.  Even in the case of those who are mentally disturbed, they know right from wrong. I know many people who have mental issues and they know better than to behave certain ways. One child, as an example, will act up when he knows people will accept his mental state as an excuse, however around those who know better than to allow it, he doesn't act up - because he knows. Being mentally altered does not dissolve you of your choices unless you are in such a mental state that you cannot make a choice - but to be in that kind of state you would not be capable of living a normal life in society - driving a car, for example.  Thus, even your argument for 'they have mental issues' holds no weight at all to excuse them for the things they do. There are pedophiles out there who aren't predators and actively seek both help and try not to be around anything that will tempt them - tempt.   Because they have and make a choice to hunt and the people who are often showcased in this sub-reddit are those who chose to do so. They are wholly to blame for what they do."

LetsNotMeet,3dkoaa,JpeTheGent44,3,Fri Jul 17 08:59:41 2015 UTC,My neighbors and I tried to save a baby bird too when we were kids. Its nest had fallen out of a tree. We put the bird and the nest in a shoebox and brought it water and worms. It died. I'm thinking baby birds generally don't fare too well when fed by human children.
LetsNotMeet,3dkoaa,MuseCo,3,Fri Jul 17 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"I have actually read a lot about wildlife rehabilitation and the reason baby birds tend to die when cared for by humans is because they aren't getting the right food. It's not true that all birds eat worms, and it is very important that baby birds get the appropriate food for their species. Most people aren't really aware so whenever they try to care for babies themselves, they typically don't make it :( It's a pretty sad thing and wildlife rehabbers try to educate, but it's not always so easy to get the word out."

This person has hate in their heart and it's clear they've thought about killing before. Do not take this person or situation lightly. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times, and stay out of places that would make you vulnerable. Always go somewhere with a friend, while also telling someone else where you are going. This person is not alright. They are not ok. I guarantee you that, to them, it was not a joke, and he certainly meant it. The very fact that he walked away trying to play it off with a smile and waving, should tell you that he knows somewhere that what he was/is doing is wrong, and he is doing it anyway.   Stop worrying about what people will think. Your life is very likely in danger. Tell all of this to someone if you haven't already. remain vigilant.   Sorry for being the doom-speaker, but I've done ALOT of victim counseling, and crisis counseling, and this is eerily close to the story of a friend of mine.

LetsNotMeet,3dheaf,melliescomingover,28,Thu Jul 16 14:56:29 2015 UTC,"Lol I call bullshit on that one. I've spent years researching Columbine and the 11k legal documents and I've never in my life encountered the 'supersoaker filled with piss' account. I think you're getting mixed up with school shooter Charles Andrew Williams, age 15, who brought a gun to the suburban San Diego high school where he was a freshman. It was a water gun, and it was filled with urine, and he shot it at people, then later brought a real gun and killed people.  As for EH & DK, they were pelted with tampons covered in ketchup in the cafeteria one time, shoved into lockers by jocks, had bottles and rocks thrown at them from moving cars, and Eric was punched in the face one time by a boy called Dan Lab. But the bullying wasn't as bad as people try to make it out to be. Most kids go through some horrible shit in high school."
LetsNotMeet,3dheaf,CodeArcher,32,Thu Jul 16 17:39:02 2015 UTC,"You ever been bullied?   To an outsider, some may seem ""not that bad"", but to the person being bullied it is all bad. And when it keeps happening, over and over, it can really fuck with a person's head."
LetsNotMeet,3dheaf,fettynofap,55,Thu Jul 16 20:25:37 2015 UTC,"Eric and Dylan were bullies themselves. There are numerous accounts of the bullying that they inflicted on other students. For example, there are school records showing Dylan Klebold stalked, bullied and threatened a kid with a learning disability called Adam Kyler for months in 1998.   Dylan Klebold's friend, Brooks Brown, who wrote a great book called 'No Easy Answers' tells everyone exactly what a complete dick Eric was to just about everyone. He constantly threatened to kill people, including Brooks, and had a website listing all the names of the people he wanted to kill. Eric threw a large chunk of ice at Brooks' car and smashed the windshield, when Brooks told him to pay for it, he laughed in his face and told him he wasn't paying for shit. Eric, Dylan, and another friend, Zach Heckler, would frequently sneak out to people's houses to vandalize their cars and homes, set off fireworks, and glue the locks on their front doors shut. They broke into a van and stole computer equipment, and had to complete probation for it.  On Halloween of their junior year, Eric and Dylan sat on the roof of Eric's house, and took shots at the little kids - innocently trick-or-treating in the street - with a bb gun. They told this story to Brooks at lunch in school the next day and he said they were laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world, and Brooks was super freaked out.  There are also witnesses who say Dylan would shove and roughly tackle girls to the ground in soccer practice and scream 'bitch' and 'whore' at them. He also killed a mentally disabled boy called Kyle Velasquez and shot a kid with cerebral palsy called Mark Kintgen. They already have a whole fandom who call themselves Columbiners and try to make as many excuses for them as possible because they were 'bullied', which is absurd. They weren't innocent, victimized kids that took a wrong turn. They were assholes even before they decided to shoot people.  And of course I've been bullied, and I'd even go as far to say I went through way worse shit than Klebold and Harris on a daily basis.  Klebold and Harris were already severely mentally ill wih homicidal and suicidal tendencies. The bullying was just the straw that broke the camel's back."

Yeah, the pranks the just kept giving. :/  Dunno why they decided to cancel ours, though, considering we were the best-behaved year since we'd arrived at the school (bar that one incident with the Principals wife... but that was back when we were all in Year 8 and only really was the fault of a few people in one class, so it really shouldn't count against us all.)

That school was completely fucked up and drunk on high school sports culture. Multiple reports showed that varsity football or wrestling members could physically assault someone in front of a teacher and nothing would happen. The valedictorian that year or the year before filed a restraining order against her boyfriend, who won or competed in a state championship. The school would only honor her request by letting her skip the last 3 weeks of classes... Getting ""0%"" on any assignment due in that period, and forfeiting her status as Valedictorian.   So yeah, it is tragedy what happened there, but as usual our media does not put anything in its proper context. It ""just happened""."

LetsNotMeet,3dheod,scarboroughangel,4,Sat Jul 18 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Once again, the issue is not that she described them, (Black, 5'10, male). The issue is the statement that followed.

LetsNotMeet,3dheod,Bruce-Wayne_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:31:24 2015 UTC,"Merriam-Websters 2nd definition of racism is ""racial prejudice or discrimination;"" meaning to pre-judge or unfairly treat one race differently from another.       I am a petite Asian (4'11) and these guys were both African-American about 5'10+. I am mentioning this because I had experienced very pushy strangers in college, who are black.        Although OP described them as tall, male, and BLACK, only BLACK (African-American) is mentioned in the subsequent sentence. She didn't say:      ""I am mentioning this because I had experienced very pushy strangers in college, who are tall.""         or, ""I am mentioning this because I had experienced very pushy strangers in college, who are male.""         So, she unfairly pre-judged these individuals based on race. RACISM.    Like I said before, she has every right to be racist, but let's at least acknowledge what it is.    Not to mention, everything else she's said:          ""Well he doesn't have to know about it."" I laughed but inside I felt a little threatened.          Why?...Oh, you told us in the next line.          I found out from a friend of mine who lived in that same apartment building that those two guys were evicted.        How do you know? Was you friend there? Did your friend show you a lineup? Did she take a pic? Or were they just BLACK?        I obviously did not want to show any type of fear for (1) they would assume I was racist because they are black or (2) they would have done something aggressive.          Are you serious, or is this a joke?         Asians are one of the most racist groups in America in my opinion.        Self-explanatory."

A bunch more shit happened with Phillip over the next two years after that happened but not all of it really fits the theme of this subreddit. I can say though that I was eventually abducted/kidnapped by Phillip himself.  It happened sometime after the event in my original post. I was spending the day at my grandparent's house. Phillip showed up with my brother who he had picked up from daycare early (I assume his name was still on the paper work or something) and convinced my grandmother that everything was fine and that my mother had sent him to pick me up. He took me and my little brother to his house and held us captive for the day. He didn't do anything to us during that time he just wasn't supposed to have us there.   I guess the story goes that he called my mom at work and threatened to kill us if she didn't come see him right away. She showed up with the cops and he got arrested. I had to testify in court and I think he got sent away fro a few months or maybe as much as two years because I don't remember seeing him for a while after that. Long story short, this guy was a fucking psycho."

LetsNotMeet,3dga6r,Chal0099,4,Thu Jul 16 03:39:04 2015 UTC,"This happened about four years ago, and I live in a different city now, so I am not too concerned. I did end up telling campus security. He pretty much avoided me after he learned that security guards and possibly the police would be involved.  I suppose he could always creep my online profiles or something but I've done my best to block his known profile names from most of my websites. That being said, there was actually another experience I had involving a DeviantArt account that might have been his but I could never prove it draw the proper parallels. It happened in the same time frame too so I always wondered if they two instances had any connection.  About four years ago, one of my longtime friends on DeviantArt sent me an urgent message telling me to check out a profile of a user I’ll call ClownsBeClowning to protect his identity. The creepy thing about this DeviantArt profile was that it was basically a shrine to me.  It had details about my life on it that only people who knew me personally or had been following the journals on my various websites would be aware of. I read through this guy’s personal journal on the profile section of his page and let’s just say there was some disturbing stuff posted on it.  There were hundreds of pictures of me (where he got them, I have no idea as I only let close friends view my pictures on my personal Facebook Page) and underneath the pictures he would list creepy things like ‘I’m always watching you’ and ‘I want to wear your skin’. He also would post links to my writing, art, and music websites and tell people to watch me because I was an angel, was perfect, and everyone should be like me. I was basically a religion to this guy that he was even going so far as to try to convert people to. It is one of the strangest things I have ever encountered, and I was terrified when I read everything though.  I told my mom about the DeviantArt user and she told me that we should report it to the police so we went to the station to give an official statement. The police turned out to be pretty useless, stating that we should take our issue to the website administraors (basically the DeviantArt staff) and have them resolve the issue from their end. So I contacted one of the admins on DeviantArt who was so freaked out by the profile they literally responded to my message the next day, telling me they had deleted the profile as soon as they saw it. Anyone who uses DeviantArt is aware that the staff usually takes a week or so to get back to you about an issue, so that just gives you an idea of what a freak this user was.  The staff member told me to also report the user to the police, which I said I had with no results. So they took the extra step and banned the user’s IP and even checked to see if he had made any shadow accounts on the site. They deleted everything related to this guy, but I still have a print out of what I took to the police which I keep filed with the police report.  I don’t know who that guy was, but I hope that I will never have to find a creepy page like that on DeviantArt…or any other site for that matter…ever again.  You can see the similarities between the two stalking instances. However the second instance seemed a little out of character of the first one, in that the blog posts didn't mention his 'angel' who he really worshiped (not me). But you never know; he might have snapped or something and made that profile.  I have had a few different instances happen in my life where I encountered weird people or was stalked so it could be any number of factors. But it is interesting to draw the connection between the two."
LetsNotMeet,3dga6r,Chal0099,3,Thu Jul 16 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"I think there is a connection between those two occurrences, and that your feeling and gut instinct are right.

It's made me naturally a pretty good shot learning young.   My Mom doesn't like guns, but she would shoot someone herself to protect me or my sister. Hell, she'd probably choke a guy out with piano wire if she had to. Fortunate to have a loving family. This affected me enough I keep a shotgun right next to the bed with shells stacked-out and lined up really to go and a 16"" Rambo style Bowie that would make someone, even with an axe, shit their pants"

LetsNotMeet,3dezwm,HairMintyFresh,13,Wed Jul 15 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"Why do people believe that if they're on the phone criminals won't try anything? I've read several reddits where redditors actually believe this. I'm like whoa. No. It's the opposite.   I had some self defense training with a police officer and he stressed that the WORSE thing you can do is get on a phone when you're walking in a dark place. Here's why:  1- It only gives the illusion of safety. What do you think the people on the line will do? Call the police? If they hear a shout or a scuffle they'd probably think you dropped your phone. OR if they do call the police do you know how long it'll take the cops to get to you? Well, IF you told your friend where you are.  2- If you're on the phone, you can't hear anything else happening on the side where your talking with the phone. Predators know this. They use it as an indication to approach from the side you're not paying attention to.  3- You are lighting yourself up in a dark place. Now they not only know you have a shiny phone, but they can see your pretty features.  Conclusion : My fellow redditors, please do not use the phone while walking. Use it before or after your walk.

LetsNotMeet,3dezwm,AnticitizenPrime,2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"The guy may very well be a creep... but your description of him reminds me of my next door neighbor. He's a tall guy with a black bushy beard, and sort of scary looking even when he's just standing there dressed normally...  Well, he's one of those guys that believes that you need to sweat a lot when you exercise. He wears plastic bags under his clothes to make him sweat faster, and wears sweatpants and a zipped-up hoodie and one of these sort of masks that cover half your face, along with gloves. His sweatshirt is a dark camo sort of pattern, dark grey on black. Basically, he looks like the generic 'terrorist' villain from a video game. He's actually a nice guy though.  He goes jogging around the neighborhood dressed like that and has an odd loping sort of gait. He jogs at night after he gets off of work. So imagine seeing a guy matching this description running down a dark street at night...  So far, he's had the cops called on him four times so far because people living in our neighborhood see him and think he's up to no good. The local police station is only a mile away so they show up pretty quickly. The first time they were really cautious when interacting with him but he says they all know who he is now. 'Oh hey, it's you.'  It's all a little funny. I've suggested that maybe he shouldn't dress so much like a goddamn terrorist when he goes out for his night runs."

I've got a bit of a baby face, but I'm 6'4 230, so usually a bit larger than the average person.

It would be easy for them to verify and a real cop would (hopefully) understand.  She could have also asked for his name and badge number to verify, which hopefully would have scared him off.  Just putting this out there in case anyone else is in a similar position."

A lot of predators will say that their victim never said no or told them to stop themselves.  Having your boyfriend or another manager do it for you is not sufficient. You need to meet with your other manager and make her aware of his advances. You need to tell your parents that you're being harassed at work.   These need to be done now.  Don't wait for it to happen again.  You need to speak up for yourself, and you need to do it immediately."
LetsNotMeet,3dcryx,Intempestivity,3,Wed Jul 15 12:23:15 2015 UTC,You need to call the police and have him hauled in and have a restraining order placed on him.

At your age, OP, I would've been too scared to say something, too, but I'm telling you, it's ""innocence"" and ""taking advantage"" that he's attracted to, behave the opposite with him and stand your ground. Your ""fuck this, I'm done for the night"" is on the right track.  Report this to upper management, or opt to have your location under surveillance by HR if your chain offers that assistance. Also- your boyfriend is a stand-up guy. I wouldn't be surprised if your manager was feeling threatened by your relationship's innocence - not just yours. I support what your boyfriend says, but if you need to stay, and would be happy there without this creep, explore your options to report this harassment. I'm a professional on most counts, but if this was happening to a sister of mine, this guy would be so blindsided by female fury, he'd turn gay. Edit: spelling."

Look in the employee handbook, and contact someone in power in the company. Document every single thing that has happened and any witnesses. Do not allow yourself to be alone with this man. I guarantee he has done this to other people as well.   Tell the nice lady you work with what he has said and how you feel.   If he asks you any personal questions, say, ""This question is inappropriate, and I feel uncomfortable"" and walk away."
LetsNotMeet,3dcryx,MuseCo,6,Wed Jul 15 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Yes to all of this. Call HR (which they should have since it's a big chain it sounds like). It sounds like he's on thin ice already. Record him on your phone when he starts his advances on you. That way there's solid proof.
LetsNotMeet,3dcryx,michelletaryn,11,Wed Jul 15 23:54:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, this is sexual harassment to the highest degree.  Something similar to this happened when I was 17 and at my first job.

To this day I regret not going to someone about what I was dealing with. My parents didn't find out until after I came home in tears one night. I quit the next day.  My advice would be, tell upper management immediately and your family. DO NOT feed into conversations at work that deal with sex and inappropriate content. I know that can be super hard but stand your ground! Say that ""you dont talk about those kind of things at work"" or ""you dont discuss your private life at work"". Say whatever you want to say but do not participate in the slightest because I promise you, he will not back down if you do.  Get yourself some type of protection, a small knife or pocket pepper spray. And keep it close to you at all times. DO NOT confront him, especially if you are alone!  Make sure someone is able to escort you to your car until this is resolved some how.  Make sure they are on time and not late. Dont be alone with him unless it's unavoidable.  Report even if you quit. By doing so you are helping to protect future employees and possibly potential victims.  I would also read some stories on this sub. Some are pretty creepy and scary but they have taught me to be more aware of my surroundings and less trusting of new people. If your gut is telling something is not right about a person or situation, LISTEN TO IT!  Please do an update soon so we know you are okay. Stay safe!   Edit: grammer and spelling errors."

He would get fired so fast after he's reported, especially so since you are a minor.   Personally, I'd say report his disgusting ass and don't let him scare you off a job if you like it but I know at 17 I wouldn't have had the guts to do it. So all I can say is please, please report him. Anonymously if you want to. He won't stop and I promise that's probably one of the reasons he works in that restaurant.
