I’m just an atheist teenager who greatly values his intelligence and scientific fact over any silly fiction book written 3,500 years ago. This being said, I am open to any and all criticism.  ‘In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god’s blessing.

Also please don't go and downvote all his posts from his profile. That will get you shadowbanned.  EDIT: I'm a liar, darqwolff isn't aalewis. But they're pretty similar, though."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,Whitelaro,117,Thu Jun 4 16:40:20 2015 UTC,"I've never heard that /u/darqwolff was /u/aalewis. Do you have a source on that? I only know /u/darqwolff as the source of the all-time greatest copypasta:   It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

Now imagine you're subject to those social occasions for a long period of your life until you really became frustrated with all of that. Then a human reaction could very well be to minimize religion anytime you hear someone mention her religious beliefs.

If there were no light, we would have no concept of darkness, and if there were no religion, no one would be talking about atheism.  Now if you're asking why atheists can't believe what they believe without being dicks about it, that's a different story. Online you tend to hear more from the jerks and loudmouths of any ideology. Myself, I don't see the point in trying to argue with my religious friends, unless they advocate turning their beliefs into legislation. (Or bombs.)

Yeah, the euphoric comment is brilliantly cringe-worthy and to be fair some of the Faces pictures are too, but some of them make a lot of sense. I don't know if OP just picked some less cringey examples or something but take this:   ""Those who know nothing and ask questions are smarter than those who know nothing and give answers""   Yeah, it's been said before, but it's a pretty solid argument."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,SchrodingersHamster,20,Thu Jun 4 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"The cringe factor is that people participated at all. Sure, some points and quotes aren't cringeworthy in themselves, but the whole thing had a sort of, ""I'm coming out and being who I really am!"" air about it. I could understand doing something like this if you were LGBT, but with /r/atheism's history, it all just stunk of smug.    It seemed to be less of ""I've been oppressed, here's who I really am"", and more like, ""Now I can put a face to my Internet genius!"""
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,17jododd,13,Thu Jun 4 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"No it is not the same as being part of the LGBT community, but from personal experience in the bible belt, there are times when being an atheist might compromise fairness in certain things and how people react to you. It is a simple fact. If people want to find community of like-minded people on the internet, I do not see a problem with that. We have a subreddit for people that believe in geo-centrism for crying out loud lol. What's wrong with people who talk about their unbelief in a subreddit."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,truthseeker1990,11,Thu Jun 4 17:56:11 2015 UTC,There's no problem with a subreddit discussing atheism and unbelief. The only problem is that /r/atheism has historically been known to be filled with some pretty smug people who believe themselves better or more intelligent than every religious person simply because they're an atheist.
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,17jododd,7,Thu Jun 4 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"Thats a weird thing to believe now that I think about it. Though, I must confess I have been guilty of the same smugness ( in a way ) in real life. I live in conservative america in the bible belt. I meet a decent amount of people who really believe that the world is 6000 years old. It is a little hard to not be just a tiny bit smug, you know. I dont feel good about it lol but wouldnt you feel the same way if you met a senior in social work who has taken a decent amount of biology classes who did not think a word of evolution was true?   I am genuinely asking. I really do feel bad about a sense of being right when talking to someone like that. But I am not sure I am being a bad person when I feel like that because the belief really is that ridiculous. There are people that believe in Scientology, and it is the same with them. I do feel a certain smugness when I hear about people talking about all the stories of scientology. I hope I am not a bad person :)"
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,truthseeker1990,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between having a belief system and denying evolution. If someone denies evolution in the face of all the evidence for it, they may deny other commonly accepted things, so it might not be far-fetched to believe you're smarter than them in some regards. What makes you smug is if you proclaim yourself smarter without really knowing.    However, just because someone has these beliefs it doesn't mean that they might not have a large amount of knowledge in some other field. This goes especially for people who are ""casually"" religious. Profession of faith in a religion does not in any way imply that a person may be uneducated. Some of the most intelligent people in the world have religious beliefs. What makes a person smug is if the believe themselves to be smarter than a scientist who just so happens to be a Christian or Muslim, siny because they have no religious belief.    TL;DR: Yes, some beliefs can be pretty silly, but having a belief doesn't imply unintelligence. Likewise, lack of religious belief doesn't imply intelligence."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,17jododd,2,Thu Jun 4 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. I just meant that I felt a little smug about it in relation to that specific thing we are talking about. I have met many extremely smart people that thought the world was 6000 years old. I really have. At no point can I say, I was smarter than them over all, no, that would be irrational of me. But as I said before, I did feel just a bit smug when talking about that one specific thing.   As for your point about casually religion people, you are right. But these werent really the people you would be likely to have such a discussion with anyways. You are also right, profession of faith does not imply that a person is uneducated. How could anyone come to that solid a conclusion from that irrelevant an evidence. I would never say or imply that. My whole point was that I have been guilty of the same smugness about certain specific things.   As to your first point, there is definitely a difference between having a belief system and denying evolution but I think it would not be very hard to find a correlation between evolution denial and religious faith. Would you disagree with that?"

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,DJSkrillex,3,Sun Jun 7 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"I think atheists are at such a point in history where ""proudly proclaiming"" is the only way to deal with being a minority. As far as I can tell, psychologically, atheists feel just as much stigma as gay people do. Only, outsiders actually rally around LGBTQ ideals, whereas no one is speaking for or in the name of atheism.   Just think about who was involved--atheists who crave group structure, and sought it out in the form of a subreddit. So when you take a million like-minded people who all feel stigmatized, and they have no one respected speaking in the name of their cause, you get a socially awkward representation of an actually noble cause. No other group is so shat on in America who do no wrong to society. Atheists are the black sheep of groups, so when you give them a soapbox (like making them a default subreddit), they're gonna sound a little autistic at times."

Intellectual discussion and honest talk is amazing and functional, but doesn't catch attention, and does not get read.  It takes a lot of the above crap to actually be intrusive in a person's life.  No amount of debate and discussion is going to ever effect a persons life if they never think to actually go watch a debate or ask questions.  That's what crap like the above does, it forces people to ask questions, exposes them to something they may have never seen before.    It may be kind of shit, intellectually dishonest, and infuriating to anyone who doesn't hold the views they attack, but it is effective at what it does, and that's why people do it.  And, I am guilty of it as anyone, but a person is likely to see no issue at all with the ""bad stuff"" on their side, while getting mad and lashing out at the ""bad stuff"" on the other side.

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,absolutedesignz,3,Thu Jul 9 07:09:15 2015 UTC,I've thought a bit about this. I think far too many people jump to mocking someone else's position at the detriment of intellectual discourse (applies to subreddits like badhistory) but when someone is clearly and intentionally ignorant and blind to critical thought and reason then I think poking fun is okay.  I still think people should tend towards good arguments because some less knowledgeable readers may gain from it.
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,Natefil,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:05:30 2015 UTC,Definitely agree that people jump to offend. But the flip side should never be to ban something from potential offense. To some people simply not believing in Christ as the lord and Savior is offensive.
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,absolutedesignz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:14:04 2015 UTC,Are we talking about mocking or offending?
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,Natefil,2,Thu Jun 4 21:20:42 2015 UTC,Either or. Mocking is calling Jesus a cosmic Jewish zombie. Offending can be merely not accepting Jesus Christ as your lord and Savior openly....or supporting gay marriage in Ireland (r/catholicism was very offended by that)
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,absolutedesignz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, thought the conversation was about whether or not mocking faces of atheism served a purpose.  I think often mockery and intentionally offending masks personal inability to argue a point. I see this a lot with the New Atheist movement where people think Dawkins, Krauss, and Harris are making new and good philosophical arguments when they are doing neither.   People will dismiss philosophy and things like the Teleological argument with mockery when even respected astrophysicists are not willing to do so."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,That_Unknown_Guy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:41:34 2015 UTC,"Mocking faces of atheism is just low brow circlejerkery. The entire thing had a purpose. But when the circlejerk subs wind of it that purpose all of a sudden became ""to show how much better they are"" and reddit never questioned.

No not everything is a nuanced and deep discussion... etc, but why should it have to be?  The way people talk about this subreddit (including you), you'd expect going to the page the background banner would read ""fuck christians lol le atheist dickbutt"" and it would be filled with people referring to religious people as subhuman or something similar, but its nothing close to that.  Its a general place for discussion about atheism. It doesnt aim to be to be anything in particular.

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,absolutedesignz,3,Thu Jun 4 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"Do you want your beliefs respected?   I think it's fairly simple. If you want everyone to respect and listen to your beliefs before going off and ridiculing them, then you must respect and listen to everyone else's beliefs too. It's not to say all beliefs are perfect or right, it's simply a matter of, ""Hey, I want you to respect what I'm saying, so I'm going to respect what you're saying as well."" It doesn't matter if what they're saying is right or wrong, you just want to show common respect so that you can be given respect in turn.   Also, you are more ""free"" to mock some things more than others because the majourity of people do so. That doesn't make mocking other's beliefs right, it just happens that the majourity of people think fruit juice curing cancer is silly. Is it right to mock someone for it? I say no.

But when it comes to beliefs it gets tricky. By giving beliefs an innate free pass from ridicule/callout/disrespect you allow some pretty shitty beliefs to get through. Mormonism. Scientology.

And they have a right to that belief, about my beliefs, too. We're every one of its crazy in the eyes of someone. All I ask is the freedom to practice my particular variety of crazy, so long as it doesn't impinge upon anybody else's rights. All I require is tolerance.  I do try to respect the beliefs of others.

It would depend on the contact of the invisible purple intangible giant dragon. Certainly I would try and dispute the claim, and also try and find out what makes you think that there's a invisible intangible giant dragon in your garage.  Presumably, If I'm walking through your garage and being ridiculed for my claim of the lack of intangible purple dragons and there is a substantial amount of people calling me out. I would assume that something had happened to convince them that there is a giant purple, invisible, intangible dragon. Thus I'd inquire their reasoning and judge it based off of its source.  Similar with Steve Jobs, he was one out of literally thousands of health practitioners, rather than examine the actual reasoning, he decided that juice was the way to go.  Religions have been followed by millions of follower for generations. Presumably, their schools of belief have some merit that has warranted this kind of following. Disregarding the factual accuracy of the stories they tell, it's the morals and ethics that being taught with those tales, that you are also ridiculing. Which then changes the ""discredit ridiculous claims"" to attacking the ethic and moral structure of the individual and (Depending on context and situation) questioning their judgment."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,TimetravelingGuide,3,Fri Jun 5 09:02:36 2015 UTC,"that's bordering on an argumentum ad populum. At what number do ridiculous claims gain credibility or at least second guessing? Is a cult with 100 members more ridiculous than one with a billion?  The claims have been made, they've been told to ""put up or shut up"" and they've moved their weight around to squash contentious thought for millenia. The spread of religion throughout the years is a well documented phenomena. Childhood indoctrination can cause people to believe all sorts of things, that shouldn't gain more merit because it is now religious. Not to mention the many times religion had been spread via the sword. Sure generation 1 or 2 may be faking but eventually generation 3+ thinks this is what they always were.  To venture closer to the point, I'm not suggesting  that people run up to people who are on their way to church and just start smacking bibles out of their hands and cursing them out. That's just disrespectful as a human being. What I am suggesting is that when religion is brought up as a way or an answer as if it is the only way or the only answer (or even offered as an equal alternative to tried and true or at least testable methods) it be called out early and often and often loudly. I'd prefer it be somewhat civil but I mean imagine having to put forth all this effort to show something is wrong when the person making the BS claim only has to say it.  I mean even something as simple as ""1+3=7"" would require you to put up more work to disprove me and all I have to do is walk away with my smug incorrect remark."
MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,absolutedesignz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:34:43 2015 UTC,"While you may have a point with the numerical historical spread of religion (specifically during the age of imperialism) I believe (and this is someone who is only vaguely remembering his history) that it had to have gained enough momentum ligitamently through the spread of appealing ideology. Even today, while there are a number of people leaving the churches, there is also an inflow of new members via invitations to friends and co-workers.   What context are you referring for religion to be brought up in? Prayer vs Medicine? Gods Wrath vs Climate change? Prayer vs therapy? Holy war vs oil war? I can't give a general response due to the variety and sheer politicization of the different religions and the subjects that they include themselves in. Though I will state that I believe that in more moral or ethical dilemmas, by turning to religion, it does offer a multitude of moral stories and guidance that one can draw advice from to apply from their current situation.   And with the ""1+3=7"" instance, while it would again fall down to the context of the conversation, I think if you reach that point, you have justification to ridicule them. However I would be more intrigued than to immediately dismiss the person. Something in his or her world view is able to explain away the facts. By inquiring and learning about the specific ideology, I could narrow down and isolate the factor that is apparently stopping them from accepting the facts. Just agreeing that the other is crazy/is doomed to hell won't actually accomplish anything significant.  So perhaps that might be a possible reason why ridiculing religion is considered socially unacceptable. It's a rejection to reach a peaceful consensus and results in a malicious tone of reference towards ones religion, or perhaps its a lack of divide between personal opinion and socially acceptable statement of opinion."

You get your jollies from belittling other people? You aren't wanted in a grown-up society.   Some things are more publicly accepted because they are less publicly believed.

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,That_Unknown_Guy,2,Fri Jun 5 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"I have to correct one part of the history given: /r/atheism was a default from the beginning of their being defaults. I was reading reddit the day it was created.  In the first instance, when defaults for the homepage were launched, membership was based on the activity of each subreddit. This was not ideal as of course defaults would get more activity, and thus stay in defaults while other good subreddits would be locked out. Anyway, /r/atheism always had lots of posting and comments so it qualified. At one point it was removed from the defaults for a technical reason, and then replaced after a popular outcry. Then later it was removed again, right after the founder of the sbreddit. /u/skeen had just been deposed. There was not such an outcry this time (and the admins had changed by then anyway).  Personally I always liked the memes. They were often clever, and a good way to discuss theology and atheist ideas in bite-sized pieces. I think it was a terrible mistake for the usurpers of /u/skeen to change that.  /u/aalewis's 'euphoric' quote was pretty clumsy, but most of the rest of the 'faces of atheism' pics were a good show of community, I thought."

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,no_turn_unstoned,11,Tue Jul 21 05:10:00 2015 UTC,"Just to point this out so you don't go through life labelling folks incorrectly: not all non - believers are going to make a mockery out of faith, because that's just mean.   I'm not a religious man, and you are - I respect that it's your decision to have faith for what ever reason it may be. It's not my place, or anyones place for that matter, to tell you that you are wrong to have those beliefs. You do what ever you damn well please to make yourself happy and content, and don't let people tell you you're wrong for doing it.   There's so many reasons people choose faith, and I think a lot of people on both sides tend to get caught up on what happens after you die or what happened before we were born rather than just accepting that it's not even really about who's right or who's wrong, it's about what brings you comfort in the present.  so, from one atheist to a christian pal - keep rocking that religion.

MuseumOfReddit,38i8se,Desmond_Winters,6,Thu Jun 4 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with your angle about people having the right to have their own beliefs. And you are right, going out of your way to bash on someone's religion is a assholish thing to do. But at the same time, I do not think there is anything wrong with talking how you feel about a religion if you are actively discussing the topic with someone or if someone asks you for an opinion. There is no need to be rude/disrespectful for no reason, but if somebody pushes you to talk about it I dont think its fair to ask non-believers to mince their words.   I also disagree that its about what brings you comfort in the present. Again, everyone has the right to decide what is important for themselves. Absolutely. But there are people out there, who genuinely care about what is truth and would like to reason and get as close as they can to what they perceive as the truth to the best of their abilities. Again, people absolutely still have the right to not give a damn about what's right and what's wrong. Just pointing out that there are people who think it is important to try and figure it out."

I dont think there is any need to tell them I have any issues with people who do adopt it. Lol, why would someone assume that I would.  But, that is not what I meant though. Often times, when people are in a discussion, or if they find out you are an atheist ( I think this might be a characteristic of a smallish town rather than a bigger city ) they can ask you specific points and reasons why. Like, ""How do you know right from wrong if you dont believe in god"" or ""Why dont you believe in god"", I just meant I think it is ok if they ask you to be involved in a discussion about the topic to tell them what your views are. It is a little more than just saying you dont believe in god because people often ask you for reasons about specific things."

MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,ryannayr140,8,Mon Dec 15 13:27:14 2014 UTC,"It's mentioned in the Wikipedia link.   Apple later reported that the victims' iCloud account information was obtained using ""a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions"", such as phishing and brute-force guessing, rather than any specific vulnerability in the iCloud service itself. It was initially believed that the images were obtained using an exploit in the Find My iPhone service.   Whether the hackers actually used the vulnerability in Find My iPhone to brute force passwords isn't known conclusively, but that it was possible to do so is not in doubt. Apple fixed that vulnerability but after the leaks had started, it seems that the service was vulnerable for an extended period.   http://thenextweb.com/apple/2014/09/01/this-could-be-the-apple-icloud-flaw-that-led-to-celebrity-photos-being-leaked/  Apple's statement was worded in such a way that you can't rule out that this vulnerability was used."
MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,skgoa,0,Mon Dec 15 17:51:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it looks like it could have very easily been a brute force attack.   All they would have needed would be the celebrities user name and knowledge of the brute force exploit.  Of course if they had a very secure password this exploit could still be useless.  In addition, someone in the comments makes a good point that the person whose password was taken through this method would be notified when they were signed up on another idevice.    But still that was a major weakness in Apple security at the time and a definite possibility into how some of the photos may have been obtained. I'm sure that skgoa would be able to add this to his synopsis as a possible vector for the collection of the photos."

MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,blorg,297,Mon Dec 15 14:55:35 2014 UTC,"This misses half of what the Fappening actually was and it miss-atributes the source of the images/videos to a hack that didn't happen.  Write-ups do exist, so I'm just going to give the tl;dr:   Insiders (friends, staff, former spouses etc.) have been stealing nude pictures and videos from other people's phones and posting them on the internet for years, some of those pictures feature celebrities. There are places, mostly in the deep web, where people trade these ""special"" nudes. One of those places was anonIB, an imageboard. A couple of weeks prior to the Fappening someone started offering celebrity nudes on anonIB, which later would turn out to be part of the same ""sets"" that would become public during the Fappening. Apparently people traded their own material with this person. (People claiming to be such ""collectors"" have claimed that the guy scammed them. But there really is no way to tell whether that's true or not.) On the friday before the Fappening, this person then offered all the material he had accumulated for sale on anonIB.   This was noticed by /b/-tards almost immediately, who started to discuss the offer's validity on /b/ over the weekend. During this time the seller's Bitcoin address recieved over $50k worth of Bitcoins. Then on Sunday evening (well, that depends on your timezone) someone started posting JLaw nudes on /b/. This was picked up by redditors in turn and the rest is described in the OP.   The origin of the hack myth might also be interesting: during the late hours of Sunday, people started asking where the nudes came from and someone just wrote ""someone probably got their iCloud hacked."" And reddit being reddit, it got upvoted massively and everyone just accepted it as fact. Even though many of the pictures and videos very obviously came from Samsung phones or had been leaked years ago. Some of the sets were known fakes as well, e.g. those ""featuring"" Jennifer Aniston or Allison Brie. Then the media picked it up and the ""hack"" became fact.   Oh and IIRC reddit did what it does best and doxxed a couple of people, getting them in trouble for being ""the hacker"".  edit: OK, I'm gonna answer people's counter-arguments once instead of replying to each comment.   ""A very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions"" is not a hack. And that's not even arguing over semantics. It means that someone either knew or guessed the target's password or the answers to the security questions. I.e. someone with special knowledge got through the security systems in the exact way they were designed, instead of breaking them. That's the digital version of someone opening a lock with a key instead of picking it.   As I had mentioned right at the start, this kind of thing has been happening for years and it is happening to millions of people every year. And crucially this happens to all kinds of accounts, including Google, Dropbox etc. (E.g. this is exactly how Palin's email was ""hacked"".) When your password is easily guessed, you don't log out of your computer/lock your phone or you give your password to people around you, even the best security systems couldn't keep your data safe."
MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,ryannayr140,126,Mon Jan 19 11:57:51 2015 UTC,"Apple themselves put out a statement explicitly acknowledging that many of the photos were stolen from unauthorised access to celebrity iCloud accounts.

MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,Drolemerk,9,Mon Dec 15 18:03:52 2014 UTC,"Phishing is a subset of hacking, they aren't mutually exclusive.

The theft of security tokens from RSA in 2011 likewise.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing#Notable_phishing_attacks  It is not clear that the Apple photo thefts were all down to phishing, either, it is very possible that passwords were brute forced and in some cases possibly reset.  You are getting into Bill Clinton ""it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is"" territory if you are arguing that mass unauthorised access to computer accounts and theft of data is not ""hacking""."
MuseumOfReddit,2pclqw,blorg,2,Mon Dec 15 20:54:37 2014 UTC,Did they phish the admin credentials or what?  I don't see how you could phish 100m+ credit cards without altering the Home Depots site itself or simply phishing the admin credentials and obtaining them that way.    I don't see phishing as hacking because you are essentially tricking someone into handing over their credentials.  There is no breaking or exploitation of the actual security systems.  I don't disagree at all that using an exploit to brute force a password would be a hack of a security system.  Hacking is essentially using a tool in an unconventional way to get your goal accomplished.

If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying ""cat family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Felix, which includes things from that scene from The Lion King to cheetah puns to Asian Tiger Parents. So your reasoning for calling a cartoon cat a cat is because random people ""call the feline ones cats?"" Let's get The Lion King and cheetah puns in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a goof or a motherfucker? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A cartoon cat is a cartoon cat and a member of the cat family.

You said a cartoon cat is a cat, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the cat family cats, which means you'd call The Lion King, cheetah puns, and other memes cats, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,Velaryon,155,Tue Nov 18 23:17:36 2014 UTC,"Surprisingly, people are still angry about him. It's the weirdest thing; anyone who's gotten into most of the ""you must have X karma"" subs knows by then that meaningless internet points are just that: meaningless."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,nmeseth,179,Thu Nov 13 14:02:00 2014 UTC,"People get way too caught up in reddit drama. I miss unidan. I thought his posts were great, and he would reliably show up whenever called to most moderate or larger subs. Rules being what they are, I understand why he was banned. Unfortunately by banning him, reddit lost a big personality that could have potentially drawn users to the site. In terms of vote manipulation, if it indeed was only 5 vote alts, I think his case could have been handled better, possibly with some discrete correspondence from the admins notifying him that they were aware of what he was doing and that he should stop immediately. Then again I'm all for transparency, and individual users shouldn't receive preferential treatment, so I guess the admins didn't really have much of a choice. I guess its just a shame. Reddit lost a big personality over something that is really quite petty."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,EliQuince,111,Thu Nov 13 14:53:36 2014 UTC,"It's entirely his fault. It would've been unfair to people that have been banned in the past if he was given a slap on the wrist. Yes, I enjoyed his comments. I think he's a very knowledgeable person. However, he broke the rules. And the rules are what help make Reddit a great place."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,Anaron,138,Thu Nov 13 15:01:25 2014 UTC,"I think he's a very knowledgeable person.   Don't give him that much credit.  He's an intelligent person but given the same mouthpiece (his popularity) there are tons of users who could provide the same level of response.  I was shocked to find that the subject of cult worship wasn't even a professional but a graduate student.  As someone in grad school right now, I can tell you there's a difference between graduate students and professional scientists.  Are they in the same field?  Yes, no one is disputing that. But as someone who is a graduate student, I am telling you, specifically, in academia, no one regards graduate students as full scientists."

MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,philmoskowitz,18,Thu Nov 13 23:10:45 2014 UTC,People get way too caught up in reddit drama.   Reddit drama is like watching sports.  Remember that it's there to entertain you and that you don't know these people and probably never will. Don't get unwisely invested in something that isn't invested in you.
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,StringJunky,6,Thu Nov 13 16:53:30 2014 UTC,"It's not a karma thing. It's the abusing of the idea of how reddit is supposed to work. The early minutes of a comment or a post is crucial to its ""success"". Only a few people would see that comment and their votes determine it goes to the bottom or goes higher and receive more visibility. By using alts to down votes stuff he doesn't like he's sending those comments to their graves and takes away the power of the community"

MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,Hetstaine,5,Thu Nov 13 15:07:12 2014 UTC,Just took a look at /u/UnidanX  and majority of his posts are controversial (has the cross thing). I guess some people automatically downvote him when they see his name.
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,theantisocialist,-4,Fri Nov 14 06:12:43 2014 UTC,Hahaha he has less Karma than me
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,Hetstaine,9,Tue Dec 2 00:01:00 2014 UTC,"I don't get why he specifically garners so much hatred when there are so many reposters trying to reap in the meaningless internet points.   Not that I'm condoning what he did, but I think to stay angry at him is like kicking roadkill."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,theantisocialist,20,Thu Nov 13 15:16:11 2014 UTC,"I think it's less because he would upvote himself, and more because he would downvote comments that were competing with his. If a comment gets enough downvotes in the first few minutes after posting, it gets hidden. He was essentially censoring comments he didn't like."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,Hetstaine,2,Thu Nov 13 15:38:08 2014 UTC,"While this is a valid reason to dislike him I do think the hate irrationally snowballed into a witchhunt sorta vibe. I get that a lot of people were pissed because they felt cheated and like he'd gamed the system unfairly but I'm not convinced he deserved all of the shit he got afterward or even now, in this thread. I find it kind of scary how quickly you can go from being a hero to being hated on Reddit.   Personally, I nothing'd Unidan. I don't frequent defaults or many of the subs he posted in so I never really got a sense of his personality."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,PatriotsFTW,5,Thu Nov 13 23:57:09 2014 UTC,I find it kind of scary how quickly you can go from being a hero to being hated on Reddit.    Just like the real world..who woulda thunk it...
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,CRODAPDX,2,Fri Nov 14 03:18:43 2014 UTC,"That's not really the same though. If you want to compare it to 'real world' situations, it's like being friends with someone for months then suddenly turning on them over something tiny and wishing them dead. That's fucking extreme by any measure."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,IAMA_dragon-AMA,3,Fri Nov 14 03:23:14 2014 UTC,"Well obviously everything happens a lot quicker on the net as hardly anyone really 'knows' each other..and it is far easier to run people down or up than it is in rl. In real life most people don't have to the balls to go face to face..but behind peoples backs it's a different story.  An internet love affair with something/someone/idea etc turning to hate can be measured in minutes or hours as opposed to days weeks out here.. same principle though.   Take your example, you find out someone you have known for months, you consider a friend and good person always there to help out.. has been going behind yours and all your coworkers backs dissing them and lying about them, blanking out work you had done and putting forth his work instead , getting all the pats on the back..then when it all comes out goes 'Sorry chaps, won't happen again, i feel pretty bad about it, good catch people !'   Yeeeah. Doesn't work for me."
MuseumOfReddit,2m5q11,ThisTemporaryLife,2,Fri Nov 14 03:38:16 2014 UTC,"But that doesn't fall in line with my example.    suddenly turning on them over something tiny   It's more like being best friends with someone then one day you find out they cheated on a maths test. Do you honestly think it would be reasonable to send them death threats, doxx them and pretty much vilify them to anyone who would listen? And continue doing so for months after the fact?   Regardless it's semantics and opinions. All I said was 'I find it kind of scary'. That opinion in no way extends to how I think you or anyone views it."

She says, ""I've always wanted to fuck to this song."" Me: ""Did you want to go eat now?"" I open the door.   I just find completely unbelievable. That he somehow completely missed these is far more unbelievable than the scenarios. If it wasn't made up, then it had to be exaggerated or altered. Like maybe they're based on real events, but instead of being clueless, he just wasn't interested but knows it's a much funnier story if he claims he missed it. I suppose it's possible he had ridiculously low self-esteem or something back then, but still.  Anyway, doesn't really matter."

Someone said they did (which would mean I'd qualify), so I sent a message to the mods and looked like a tool (I mean, I was polite, but when I hit it, I'm given to understand that a bot will invite me, so meh.)  Not that it's a huge deal, but sure, I'll take whatever I qualify for. Most of it is crap, but some of it can be fun. :)"
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,UnluckyLuke,3,Thu Aug 21 02:22:10 2014 UTC,"They don't count combined karma. Either of your counters must be at 100k, or -100k.  You know, it's just a private club. They don't plan on taking over reddit or the world haha  He knows too much…"
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,ReyasWI,4,Thu Aug 21 10:42:54 2014 UTC,"Do some accounts just sort of age into the century club? Like, they don't really do anything amazing they just stuck around for a while?"
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,UnluckyLuke,7,Thu Aug 21 04:26:27 2014 UTC,"You mean people who have 100k without trying? Yeah, for instance /u/The1RGood certainly didn't expect to get all that karma from his askreddit thread. But maybe that's not what you meant."
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,ReyasWI,12,Thu Aug 21 10:47:58 2014 UTC,"I started whoring it up after that, though."
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,UnluckyLuke,3,Thu Aug 21 14:09:37 2014 UTC,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  Did you get less than 100k with that thread?
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,explosivefajitas,8,Thu Aug 21 14:14:36 2014 UTC,67k. But who's counting?
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,girlydom,3,Thu Aug 21 14:20:01 2014 UTC,Yeah I edited my comment to make it clearer. Auto correct makes fools of us all.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,kerrianneta,3,Thu Aug 21 14:20:53 2014 UTC,Damn I just noticed you were /u/AntiLuke. We meet again!
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,pigferret,4,Thu Aug 21 14:22:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah. For some reason I feel it necessary to talk to the Lukes I see on here. I always try and be polite though, I'm not a bigot."

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,genitaliban,31,Wed Aug 20 23:58:15 2014 UTC,"Ferd is ok but he can't push people's buttons anywhere near as well as Dw. It's just so subtle that even when you're in on the joke, you half believe he's totally serious."

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,ManlyPoop,6,Thu Aug 21 05:00:40 2014 UTC,Hah. I mod a couple subs with him. Had no idea he was so prolific.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,mozerdozer,5,Thu Aug 21 09:53:05 2014 UTC,Did his karma get reset? It's only at -100
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,Lunaisbestpony42,6,Thu Aug 21 21:32:46 2014 UTC,That's the new minimum now.

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,thisbaseball17,6,Thu Aug 21 07:08:51 2014 UTC,"Yes, but the truly dedicated ones don't do it for the number. They do it for the million of people they annoy. I'm sure if DW weren't banned he'd still be just as prolific."
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,thisbaseball17,2,Thu Aug 21 13:07:10 2014 UTC,dw was quite heavily inspired by him as well if I remember right.

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,RichieMclad,42,Thu Aug 21 10:45:49 2014 UTC,He was shadowbanned.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,KennyLog-in,40,Thu Aug 21 10:21:21 2014 UTC,"And then the admins limited negative karma to -100. Doesn't stop /u/FabulousFerd (who was 2nd behind Dw-Im-Here), but it's a shame to not see the leaderboards anymore."

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,lecterrkr,90,Thu Aug 21 02:38:52 2014 UTC,All submissions in this subreddit must be approved by the moderators.  A shadowbanned account may still have submissions (or comments) approved and be visible.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,HIFW_GIFs_React_,23,Thu Aug 21 04:00:43 2014 UTC,TIL. Thanks.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,ProfitLemon,15,Thu Aug 21 03:58:30 2014 UTC,What's the new imposed minimum then?
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,sssyjackson,28,Wed Aug 20 22:02:55 2014 UTC,-100
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,yakabo,16,Wed Aug 20 22:04:26 2014 UTC,I'm guessing this gets rid of trolling for negative karma?
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,RichieMclad,23,Wed Aug 20 22:07:00 2014 UTC,"Possibly, but there are some poor twisted souls out there that just want to see the world burn."
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,UnluckyLuke,7,Thu Aug 21 00:13:16 2014 UTC,I think it's to discourage people from deleting negative comments.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,KennyLog-in,22,Thu Aug 21 00:21:35 2014 UTC,"Ah, all that gold. It feels good to have gilded a legend, that I could be part of that. It was this one, one that I thought was actually quite agreeable."

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,DrHemroid,6,Thu Aug 21 05:05:36 2014 UTC,The original post is marked... His comment isn't because it isn't NSFW
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,McWanghole,2,Thu Aug 21 15:14:34 2014 UTC,I can't decide whether that gif is hilarious or disturbing. Probably both.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,nerpss,1 point,Wed Aug 20 22:47:27 2014 UTC,It's very nicely titled.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,yakabo,2,Thu Aug 21 00:58:33 2014 UTC,do you have more comments of him?.. is there a way to track all his contribution? or most of?

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,MiscManletKiller,19,Thu Aug 21 03:04:31 2014 UTC,Yeah. More subscribers means he could lose karma more easily.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,kyrocon,19,Thu Aug 21 04:45:14 2014 UTC,It isn't anymore.
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,masongr,10,Thu Aug 21 05:11:35 2014 UTC,Does anyone have screenshots of his antics? I never heard of this guy before.

MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,Kochen,6,Thu Aug 21 14:48:45 2014 UTC,Haha i took a screenshot of your karma before you got shadowbanned
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,Volpethrope,9,Thu Aug 21 17:19:21 2014 UTC,"And he still isn't unbanned, nor has any of the gold been refunded. Poor guy."
MuseumOfReddit,2e4cvj,spencer102,3,Thu Aug 21 00:00:57 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I won't be buying gold anytime in that case. Why spend money for the user experience / helping reddit only to be randomly banned one day! And if you are shadowbanned and message the mods/admins, no one ever gets back to you."
