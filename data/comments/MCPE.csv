MCPE,3dykhm,Luigi370,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:12 2015 UTC,Why change something that's been the same since the start? I really like how it looked in the Minecon 2015 footage with the crouch button being a single tap toggle at the right. If we're going to be running and jumping with this new control scheme you have your right finger would have to be on the jump button which means you can't be actively moving the camera.

MCPE,3dwgqz,Trap_Lawwd,0,Mon Jul 20 02:43:54 2015 UTC,Well you connect a controller and then you can probably ree map buttons and such and then you can play. Don't see Joe that's hard to grasp.
MCPE,3dwgqz,blues4thecup,4,Mon Jul 20 02:53:12 2015 UTC,But How Will The Controller Be Connected That's What I'm wondering
MCPE,3dwgqz,LazyCouchPotato,2,Mon Jul 20 03:01:55 2015 UTC,There are controllers that can be connected via Bluetooth for both iOS and Android. My Android phone is rooted so I can play games using my PS3 controller.
MCPE,3dwgqz,Fiti99,3,Mon Jul 20 03:03:57 2015 UTC,"Same, the only reason i rooted my phone is so i can use my ps3 controller"
MCPE,3dwgqz,Fiti99,3,Mon Jul 20 03:22:36 2015 UTC,Okay Thanks To All of You Good Thing My Phone Is Rooted
MCPE,3dwgqz,LazyCouchPotato,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"If you will use a ps3 controller via bluetooth you will need an app named sixaxis controller, you can find it on the play store"
MCPE,3dwgqz,blues4thecup,2,Mon Jul 20 03:27:01 2015 UTC,This is the app. It's worth the buy.   This is a free app to check if your phone is compatible or not.  If you need any help with it feel free to message me here.

MCPE,3dth4p,HyperCamel,3,Sun Jul 19 23:33:27 2015 UTC,Plus the difficulty level on mcpe is equivelent to easy mode on pc so they need to add different levels of difficulty which will need improvement as you said to the mob AI.
MCPE,3dth4p,Air_chandler,2,Sun Jul 19 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"Actually all mobs except creepers, skeletons and enderman use the new ai (only that they dont pickup items or armor and dont have rare drops) also i remember that creepers and skeletons used the new ai in a 0.9 beta build but was removed because skeletons didnt shoot arrows and creepers didnt explode, so hopefully they will implement the new ai without bugs in a future update"

MCPE,3dth4p,MIGHTY_ANUS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:29:07 2015 UTC,"And finally, the one that bothers me the most is that they are just dumb. Villagers don't have the same AI as their PC counterparts and can't even their own doors to their houses. Also, in PC when its Normal Survival and I have no armor but a wooden sword immediately I want to find a shelter. Because those hostile mobs are dangerous! Skeletons are hard to approach because they land nearly every hit. Spiders lunge at you at a blink. And zombies are just plain scary. However, in PE, the experience is different. I don't need to find a shelter. Skeletons aren't those massive aimbots you'd find in PC. Zombies are easy. Creepers don't cover as much of a blast radius as PC. Spiders aren't hard to even kill because all the mobs are just so slow. I would rather have a more survival like experience where mobs are actually a nuisance to defeat and not just a key lime pie you finish in seconds."

MCPE,3dtia1,77RedDude77,4,Sun Jul 19 12:06:21 2015 UTC,The number of slots in the hotbar usually changes to five when you have Split Controls turned on. Once you turn it off you need to close Minecraft and reopen it. The number of slots will turn back to seven.  I wish they would just keep it seven at all times.

MCPE,3dtia1,jared213,2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"After you switch off split touch controls, you have to restart the app for it to revert back to 7 slots."

MCPE,3d9gro,Capopanzone,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:14 2015 UTC,"So I'm getting ready 0.12.  Very exciting!  I've modified my mob system to change it from a drowning system (it was a lava blade originally) into a fall system.  The idea is to have the mobs fall and survive with minimal health so that they can be easily dispatched to get EXP.    It seems to be working well.  Quite productive.  There is one odd thing -- I've found that it will not produce if I wait at the bottom, I need to move approx 24 blocks away (horizontally) to get it to produce again.  (I'd love to hear one of the devs talk about mob spawning rules :) it appears to me that the mob spawning rules only use horizontal distance, not absolute 3d space distance.)  To optimize this, I've added an underwater railway that runs from the front of the drop area to a location ~24 blocks away.  It's kludgy but it works.  Here are a bunch of pictures  And here's a link to an old post describing the mob system (note: this post is for a different world, same mob system design though)  edit -- added a few more pics of the harvest area."
MCPE,3d9gro,richmondgreen,2,Tue Jul 14 15:25:26 2015 UTC,Awesome!  It doesn't use a mob spawner from a dungeon right?
MCPE,3d9gro,-Liviticus-,2,Tue Jul 14 17:03:17 2015 UTC,It doesn't use a mob spawner from a dungeon right?   Correct.  It uses just regular mob spawning.  The link to the old post provides a lot more detail and a world download :)
MCPE,3d9gro,-Liviticus-,2,Tue Jul 14 17:06:01 2015 UTC,If you ever find the time - can you maybe just link me to the design? I'm having a terrible time trying to make a mob system with all of my previous designs failing to the point of receiving maybe one nob every 10 or so minutes.  Edit: I saw all of the pictures but I can't seem to get a grip on the design or how to convert it for EXP.  Edit 2: It appears to just be Etho's mob trap. I'm stupid. Sorry.
MCPE,3d9gro,-Liviticus-,2,Tue Jul 14 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"You can follow the link in my post below to get a world download and see more info on the system I made.   The thing with mob systems seems to be that you need to move away horizontally ~24 blocks (and not much further than that) and WAIT there for a good bit, and then come back.  You can also play with setting the difficulty to Passive, go back to the game, and then reset it to Hard.  You also need to minimize other spots that mobs can spawn -- so light up nearby caves and surface."
MCPE,3d9gro,Mildcartoon922,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:02 2015 UTC,Edit 2: It appears to just be Etho's mob trap. I'm stupid. Sorry.   Actually it is not - it uses trapdoors.  I did not find the classic etho mob trap very productive.  Look here to see my old post about the design.

MCPE,3d9gro,Timber_pigs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"The single most important thing I've found is this:  Light up the surface and caves within ~200 blocks.  The idea is that you want to minimize the spots that mobs can spawn not inside your mob system, and maximize the space inside your mob system that they can spawn.  To reset the mob system (if it is not productive):  1) Move ~24 blocks (horizontally) away (but not more than ~32 blocks) and WAIT for a bit of time (1-2 minutes); go back and see if you have mobs  2) Change Difficulty option to Passive; go back into game; change difficulty to Hard (this removes ALL mobs and then re-enables spawning)."

It would just be one of many comments and you can just choose to ignore it. Seems like you're making a mountain out of a mole hill...  Edit: and this is why I dislike this sub. Only good stuff in here is when the devs do answer people's questions and some of the self built posts. The rest is whining and complaining and it gets upvoted while people asking questions get shat on. Fantastic attitude mcpe community.

Plus, there's no EXP level anymore and you resized the enchant panels quite a lot, so they aren't pixel perfect anymore, which they have to be.

The reason I didn't include the EXP level because to be honest with you, I forgot! :P Like I mentioned earlier I got the enchantment options from a picture I got from google.

Also I'm hoping you add wither paintings and large portals (like in PC sometime soon)! :D"

MCPE,3cujfj,V3NUS_M1NER,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source? Nether boats are not a feature on PC and the devs are aiming for feature parity on all versions (the same features on all versions) so if they were going to add them, they wouldn't be a priority I don't think. Meaning they wouldn't be 'pushed' to a later version because there is no rush or priority needed to add them!  But an interesting idea nonetheless!"

MCPE,3ctjj4,uinstitches,16,Fri Jul 10 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"For now also Music, yeah. It's really easy to add music if you can just make the game 200 mb big, but on phones we need to come up with a way (actually, 4 different ways, one for each Store...) to distribute the music, and we didn't have time for that as well. But it's coming in the next release too!"
MCPE,3ctjj4,mojang_tommo,3,Fri Jul 10 21:50:14 2015 UTC,"Damn i really wanted the music, but well i hope you come up with a way to distribute the music, just another question, we will be able to play our win10 maps on pe and viceversa?"
MCPE,3ctjj4,Fiti99,10,Fri Jul 10 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on one hand we could just spend bucketloads of money and host the music ourselves, on the other there's months of boring in-app work to do.

MCPE,3ctjj4,mojang_tommo,3,Fri Jul 10 23:02:52 2015 UTC,So we know music and new GUI for MCPE is coming for 13.0. Do you have any teasers or hints you want to share /u/mojang_tommo
MCPE,3ctjj4,Orange5151,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:51 2015 UTC,Its 0.13 The major number is 0. Not 13

MCPE,3ctjj4,JustSarcasm_YouKnow,-2,Sun Jul 12 17:51:39 2015 UTC,And resource pack support
MCPE,3ctjj4,Mildcartoon922,2,Fri Jul 10 21:56:55 2015 UTC,I think they said thats coming when they add the new controller interface. Where you'll be able to edit how the controls look on the screen and where they are placed.

MCPE,3ctjj4,RichvilleF12,6,Sat Jul 11 07:25:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what we need to do. However, Minecraft has a lot of players, so ""just putting it online"" could mean having this 150 mb file downloaded 10s of millions of times. That costs a lot of money for us, so it would be better to rely on the various appstores even if it takes time :)"
MCPE,3ctjj4,DJ_FrozenDoctor,2,Sat Jul 11 11:03:55 2015 UTC,"What type of music is making the ""music"" file so huge anyway? Like how many music tracks is in the file. Because some music tracks size is  only have about 3-9 MB (max could be 15MB) And we only need like about 10-20 tracks for PE. Just wondering because how could a music file be that big in size if only about 10-20 music tracks is in there?   Note: I might be wrong with the total amount of music is in that file anyways, I think maybe 20+ music total is in there"
MCPE,3ctjj4,RichvilleF12,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:51:53 2015 UTC,I think that they use OGG extension files. I'd rather use MP3 files than OGG though.
MCPE,3ctjj4,KegGreenhouse3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:58:13 2015 UTC,"MP3 files are better than OGG, for 1: less hard drive(SSD) space and  2) the system can use it and process it a bit more quicker. I might be wrong though."
MCPE,3ctjj4,tadunne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"Is the goal to get the game in beta by 0.13.0 or 0.14.0, or later?"
MCPE,3ctjj4,mojang_tommo,-2,Sat Jul 11 16:26:24 2015 UTC,What's wrong with making the download bigger? Many games on the app stores are big! And 200mb is at the low end..  Not sure wanting to maintain the ability to get the game over 3G is really such a blocker any more!?  Just look at some of the recent games I've downloaded:  Batman beyond Gotham 1.2gb Broken age 2.5gb
MCPE,3ctjj4,tadunne,8,Sat Jul 11 09:20:04 2015 UTC,"Well, it's because phones have been getting more powerful in every way, but not bigger on average. IPhones still exist with only 12 gb free, so that would cause the game to be uninstalled a lot. Those big games are usually played and then thrown away, while Minecraft is rarely uninstalled if at all probably because it's so small :) Also, over 50mb you can't let people buy the game over mobile data anymore."
MCPE,3ctjj4,Mildcartoon922,2,Sat Jul 11 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not moaning btw or having a go.. I was just sayin..,anyway you guys have got to do what you have got to do.  And you're doing an amazing job, keep up the good work!!"

MCPE,3ctjj4,DJ_FrozenDoctor,-1,Mon Jul 13 14:03:58 2015 UTC,Wait about ios 9. They said they would add support for screen recorders for games what does that mean for MCPE?
MCPE,3ctjj4,Deji2002,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"I thought it was 60MBs? Unless that's Google Play. I don't know much about any app stores but Google Play and Amazon.   You don't have to read the rest, but you can if you want.   Do you agree that being an indie game developer is fun? We know that it can be frustrating at times, but still  continues to talk like I know programming, scripting, coding, and other stuff  All I do for now is Textures, some music, and publish apps. I need to learn Java so I can make this one game that's inspired by Minecraft, but its not as blocky, and there are more shapes and more things to do."

MCPE,3ctjj4,KegGreenhouse3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:09:47 2015 UTC,Because I really really want music in pocket edition and it would be wise to add just a few music for now so that it wouldn't make a huge difference in app size. Then you add more in the next upcoming release

MCPE,3cp428,Fiti99,7,Thu Jul 9 17:32:20 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of PC based crafting personally, it adds that next level of game play. I guess it would frustrate new or very young players. however it doesn't seem to bother PC players, i guess that's because they expect it when they buy the game."
MCPE,3cp428,zerotol4,5,Fri Jul 10 00:26:55 2015 UTC,I personally love the drag and drop but it would be frustrating to drag your finger on an iPhone or a Nexus 5
MCPE,3cp428,Mildcartoon922,2,Fri Jul 10 02:33:59 2015 UTC,"I think its only gonna be in win10 because most devices, with MCPE version, would be to small for drag and drop."
MCPE,3cp428,Mildcartoon922,2,Fri Jul 10 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think so unless your running using an extremely small screen in which you probably can't play the game properly anyway. We can already see the 9 boxes in the crafting table and the items in your inventory, it wouldn't be that difficult, just tap item in your inventory and tap the box you want to put it in simple, you can craft many items at once rather than pressing the button 236 times to make multiple items."
MCPE,3cp428,zerotol4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Well i would say it would uncomfortable with that ui. If they used the current screen for crafting and change it to drag amd drop, would be comfortable. They might add drag and drop but not with that particular interface."
MCPE,3cp428,Mildcartoon922,2,Fri Jul 10 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Whats wrong with the PC crafting interface? it's clean and bright it does not take up your entire screen for no reason leaving you with no idea whats in front of you and potentially killed, I would imagine on a phone it would be wise to have the popup box take up more screen real estate than on the tablet but i think it could very much work"
MCPE,3cp428,zerotol4,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:45:39 2015 UTC,Yeah well thats what i was saying. But the one in win10 would be to small to craft on a phone (remember not everyone has a huge tablet or phone)

If they remove that feature with the new PC layout, the feel of crafting in PE will fade away."

I'm really happy that we can expect to get so many features in this next update, and have been promised even more by the end of the year.  The only other thing I hope for is some bug fixes.  #1 is the fall damage problem with multiplayer.  That really makes multiplayer games almost too messed up to bother with (local ones over wifi, at least, I haven't tried servers).  Would be great to fix the issue with saplings too, which messes up tree farming.  I can wait on most everything else.  Though honestly I really, really want hoppers and dispensers."

MCPE,3cnihs,Runna4life,7,Thu Jul 9 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"The whole reason the Redmond team was hired to work on 0.12 was because of the upcoming HoloLens, and Microsoft knew it would be running on PE, and they wanted it to appeal to PC users so they knew more features had to be added to PE, and faster.   Even after 0.12, Pocket Edition is still lacking features from PC, so I'd imagine the Redmond team will stay til PE is finally up to date. They're probably working on The End as we speak."

It needs further testing and we never seen a beta release for it yet. The Windows 10 users on the other hand will probably see a faster update release than iOS and android because the windows 10 version of MCPE v0.12.0  is almost complete (in features wise) while the iOS and Android side expect 1 day (maybe on the same day as for the Windows 10 users) to 1 month after the release of windows 10 mope.  So to summarize:   The release date of v0.12.0 is varied  Windows 10 Users expect:  The day of  July 29,2015 or even a day or week after that. Around July 29 to Early August. Because you guys have the most developed version of v0.12.0 than any other MCPE platforms, you guys will likely see a faster release  iOS users expect:  Maybe July 29,2015. But maybe the official release is in Early to Late August Don't forget apple app updates is sorta slow. Taking 6-7 days from submission to be officially released.  Android Users expect:  Maybe July 29,2015. More likely a beta version of v0.12.0 in that day or week. Official release maybe in early August to Late November   Windows 10 users may have the update first than iOS and Android. But android and iOS will have it soon after. Maybe Windows 10 1st, Android 2nd, and iOS 3rd"

Now really all we need is The End and Redstone and few more mobs, then the bridge between PC and PE has been pretty much closed!  As for 0.13, I'd say we'll get the following:   Redstone Jungle temple/desert temple The Wither Witches Guardians/ocean monuments   0.14:   Trading Beacons Stained glass Horses Ender chests Maps   1.0:   The End (end city dungeon, islands, shulker, chorus plant) Game modes; hardcore, adventure Dual wielding Enchanted arrows Shields   How does this timeline look, /u/mojang_tommo /u/jeb_?"

Well those are the kind of people being added to the mojang team nowadays. These people still have passion! That's what matters!"

MCPE,3cepa9,ProfPixel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:20:06 2015 UTC,"Do you mean they get more than just appreciation? Cause yes, and they earned every bit of it. If you are saying something else, you need to fix that sentence!"

These developers work on mcpe, so of course we are going to only thank the developers on a subreddit that has everything to do with them! If other people start working on mcpe then we'll thank them too! If you want to thank other people that have nothing to do with minecraft they probably have subreddit for that, go have fun, just leave us to thank the developers that make this great game!"
