autism,3dzpvw,suugakusha,3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry!!  Although we're not on the spectrum, I had similar problems with my mom because we both have ADHD.   My husband (also ADHD) and I have similar issues too, especially as we've gotten older (mid-40s).  I don't really have good advice, just sympathy!  My husband and I are able to make it work by having a lot of very open conversations where we just try to be very understanding.  With my mom, I actually don't spend time with her any more, but it's because she's also bipolar and it got truly impossible to be with her, due my kids.  Maybe a ""breather"" could help you?"

autism,3e0x1w,AutiSpasTacular,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"Open the windows when you go to view to check for noise from the street. Have a conversation at a normal voice level - the room WILL be a little louder than normal for lack of stuff on the walls, but it will give you a good idea of what it will sound like later.  If you can, check out what the rest of the flat sounds like when water is running - that was a HUGE problem for me in my first flat (to the point where not even headphones helped), where the hot water boiler was -in my closet- (ugh).  Things you can do to reduce the noise level once you move in: Thick curtains are known to help with visual things, but they also help muffle both temperature variations and outside noise. In general, more cloth and untreated wood in your room will help keep it quieter, so think about a couch and some throw pillows, maybe a bookshelf.  If you are diagnosed, your meltdowns should not be a valid reason to kick you out of your apartment in most countries, because they're a part of your disability."

autism,3e19s6,NTTHRASH,4,Tue Jul 21 04:37:23 2015 UTC,"Some of this will fade with age and experience. No matter how smart you are, you are never as smart as you will be tomorrow, with more experience and knowledge. There are things you think you know today that you will eventually realize you are wrong about, and with that understanding will come the realization of your own fallibility.  It may help to do some thought exercises on the breadth and depth of human knowledge. There are roughly 7 billion people in the world today. Every one of them sees, hears, and experiences things every day that you do not. There are tens if not hundreds of millions of published books in existence, every one of them containing hundreds of thousands of words, many written by people far more intelligent than even you.  In your entire lifetime you could not even make a dent in absorbing, accumulating, and understanding even the smallest fraction of that knowledge. Every person you meet, no matter your perception of their relative intelligence, knows or understands something that you do not.   Something else to keep in mind: as an aspie you should be well aware that how people perceive you and your actions is not always accurate. The same is true for how you perceive others. How intelligent you perceive someone to be, and how intelligent they actually are, are never the same.  Lastly I might recommend studying up on cognitive biases. Even the most brilliant people are subject to biased thinking. Bias is something that can be very difficult, if not sometimes impossible, to rid yourself of. But studying it and being mindful of it can at least help you be aware of how unreliable your own perception of your own intelligence can be."
autism,3e19s6,cpt_anonymous,4,Tue Jul 21 14:25:04 2015 UTC,"Um, I would probably go with a modified version of option #2: Be OK with the fact that not everyone is AS intelligent as you are or AS capable of basic thought as you. I put the word 'as' in all caps to put emphasis and intonation on that word; I was not trying to write an abbreviation for Asperger's Syndrome. The only educating of people I would do if I were you is educate about them about Asperger's Syndrome if they are interested or educate them if your job is to be their teacher or tutor. You don't seem like you would be old enough yet to be graduated from college and have teaching credentials. I guess to stop feeling like a god you would need to become more humble, and being humble is something that I actually struggle with two, so I guess we both can work on it. Also, the tough days that you have with Ehler-Danlos Syndrome and Asperger's Syndrome could help you a bit with coming down to earth and be not feeling 'like a god' to use your terminology. If you go on the separate subreddit for Asperger's Syndrome and start writing solutions and the fact that you have Asperger's Syndrome in the comments section below posts that are about problems parents' kids with Asperger's Syndrome are having, they will probably ask you questions and you would get to educate them about Asperger's Syndrome at least.  Maybe you were born with Ehler-Danlos Syndrome in addition to an extremely high level of intelligence as a way to keep you in check and remind you that you are still human.   I suppose that enrolling in one of those Ivy League schools like Harvard or Yale and then becoming a professor at an Ivy League school might help you with realizing that there are other people who are also highly intelligent and to help you to have a better perception of the people around you. I would recommend applying to all 8 of the Ivy League schools (you can find them here: http://www.ranker.com/list/all-ivy-league-schools/sportsyeah) and also apply to Carnegie Mellon Unviersity, which is also a highly competitive university. My older brother is probably a lot more intelligent than me in a lot of things, like science, math, robotics, and writing. However, when he applied to Carnegie Mellon University, he got on the waitlist instead of being accepted into the college, whereas at Case Western Reserve University, which is a less competitive college, he got accepted there. He is now graduated and has a decent job. I guess what I'm trying to say here with my older brother example is that maybe you'll apply to all those colleges and get into some of them, but if you get on the waitlist or denied admittance, it might be a way to keep you humble and realize that there are either 1) Smarter students than you going there or at least just as smart or 2) The students that have really rich families who are able to pay the entire tuition, room, board cost every year will get in and it takes more than high intelligence to get into those schools.   Also, I discovered something in a TV show called HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER and I think it was the Malcolm Gladwell book called DAVID AND GOLIATH: UNDERDOGS, MISFITS, AND THE ART OF BATTLING GIANTS is that it might be really easy to get into a certain art program (TV show example) or to get into a good, more competitive school (Malcolm Gladwell book example), but it can be a lot harder to thrive and be one of the really good students for very long or at all. In the Malcolm Gladwell book, the female student struggled so much in this one class after the first semester and was feeling so crummy, that she switched from one major to another. In this DAVID AND GOLIATH by Malcolm Gladwell book, this female college student said that if she had gone to the mediocre college, she would have still been the major she started off with. I recommend reading this book by Malcolm Gladwell and others by him; I think that you will find them to be pretty interesting. Maybe you will have a somewhat similar experience to this female college student, maybe you won't, but it's still a good thing to think about. I also recommend reading this newspaper article: http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/education/learning-disabled-for-a-day.html, starting on the paragraph where it says ""So-and-so had an IQ of 135 but had a second-grade reading level."" This student was highly intelligent like you, but there was an area of school and life where he would have been considered extremely unintelligent. Anyway, now I'm finally done with saying that all I wanted to say to help you. I'm sorry about any traumatizing school memories this article or the video related to it brings back. Sorry that this comment is now a lot longer and the lecturing tone in it. Please don't get mad at me about anything written in this post, I only want to help you with the thing you asked for help in in your above post.  Edit: Colon punctuation symbol after option #2 and added the word 'you' after the second 'as' in the first sentence. 2nd and 3rd edit: added on three more paragraphs after the first paragraph and almost immediately added in extra sentence to last paragraph to kind of wrap up my helping thoughts."
autism,3e19s6,AutismFtw,4,Tue Jul 21 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"1.) You don't know nearly as much as you think you know, regardless of your IQ or how brilliant you may be in certain subjects. For how much you know about energy conservation or the violin, for example, you don't know that much about a million more topics. You do not know what you do not know.   2.) I think the only real way to education educate every-day-people you come in contact with is to lead by example.   3.) Don't confuse critical thinking with intelligence. There is something to be said of the average, or below-average, intelligence  person who is willing and wanting to learn and thinks for themselves.   4.) There is a cliched but true quote you've probably read before:  ""Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”   5.) Life is not a popularity contest, and it doesn't matter how many friends you have. I think having a big group of friends is highly overrated. Find your niche. Find people who you have things in common with, who you can be on the same level with. Those are the people who you concern yourself with."

Once you have to fend for yourself, you'll find that out. That's when you will learn that you IQ is not the thing to help you through the world, at least not on its own.  For now just realize that you can never change other people. All you can do is change how you respond to the behavior you encounter. Respond in thought, emotion, intentions. Focus on you, because that's where your circle of influence really ends. Focus on being happy, not being smug.  Happy needs some kind of interaction with other humans so find your way around others and to be able to do that, first of all stop judging. Every time you find yourself judging someone, just say 'Stop! Stop! Stop!' in your mind. After a while, you will have stopped judging and the world around you will be a friendlier, gentler place for you. Enjoy."

autism,3dwthe,embracingthespectrum,6,Mon Jul 20 11:46:39 2015 UTC,"First thing, start a gofundme page. Legal stuff can come later, you need money for your mortgage right now. You can try but the bank may not be understanding and you will be wasting precious time. I wouldn't even bother with the Mom right now. You need to focus on paying your bills and caring for your sons. Get your gofundme going now but you will have to be willing to share personal information that will definitely identify who you are and what your situation is.   If you attend church please speak with the preacher or priest privately. Plenty of people can help you watch your sons while you figure out something for work. Employment is something you will have to figure out pretty quickly along with a Nanny situation. If you have SSI for one son you may be able to apply for home health or at the very least right off all of your care expenses.   I hate to say it but if one of your sons is not as disabled, he could get a simple job at your local Wal-Mart. Plenty of places hire disabled people. It can be temporary just to help with the bills."

autism,3dwthe,crunchyloam,4,Mon Jul 20 15:35:51 2015 UTC,Dont know how feasible this really is but on paper it might work: If you have to stay home to take car of your kids consider opening a day care or after school care. You could even specialize in it being for autism spectrum children because you have experience in that. I imagine parents would be willing to spend a little bit more for a specialized care service. You will only be able to care for a few (check your state laws) but could expand and hire additional care specialists and grow the business.

I am familiar with legal aid in Atlanta, and I think they could help you with those things, although they do NOT help with domestic relations (i.e., divorce proceedings) that I know of.    they MIGHT help you pursue child support??  I am not certain about that.  having done a tiny bit of pro bono work for atlanta legal aid, I know that there is a preferred nonprofit organization that helps people with debt reorganization without going through bankruptcy.  they contact all your creditors for you and help make arrangements.    a legal aid lawyer would probably give you their number.

That way, the next time you decide that's the thing you want, it'll be right there - there will be no time for you to change your mind because you can eat it right away!"
autism,3dys2a,wkpaccount,4,Mon Jul 20 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"gosh I don't have any good ideas.  I'm the mom, so I deal with this by eating all my son's leftovers.  Unfortunately I've gained a lot of weight!    My best idea to avoid this would be for you to try to create a diet composed entirely of food that is ""ready to go,"" so there is no preparation time in which to change your mind.    In this particular case, instead of making 6 crackers with cream cheese, perhaps you would sit down with the box of crackers and a box of cream cheese, open.  Make only ONE cracker at a time!  it seems unlikely you would change your mind in the time it took to spread cheese on a single cracker, but if you did, it would be only one cheese-cracker going in the garbage.  I'm not (quite) on the spectrum, but I often make complicated recipes only to wind up not wanting the food, and I also have a very strong resistance to eating something I don't want.  I mean, I have a gag reflex, and I really have ZERO ability to make myself eat something.    Now that I am the mom, I do find this a problem because I literally cannot afford it, so that forces me to be more cautious before I make something."

I learned that turning down the temperature on the refrigerator even a modest amount could dramatically lengthen its shelf life.  I used to keep it in the higher range of acceptable, because I wanted to save energy.  However, since I turned it way way down -- so that the top shelf of my fridge is usually just barely above freezing -- my food stays fresh a crazy amount of time!!  In fact, I now have the problem that there is food in there that ""feels"" uncomfortably old, but seems perfectly fine, and I no longer have any objective means of verifying it's safe, now that the standard recommendations no longer apply.  Please consider doing this, because then maybe if you refrigerate that meal you no longer want, you can eat it later."

Obviously I haven't seen your brother in person and haven't witnessed his interactions with others, but most people don't realize that some of the more severe problem behaviors that individuals with ASD exhibit are often actually due to comorbid intellectual disability rather than ASD itself.  Has your brother ever had a psychological evaluation to determine his IQ/adaptive behavior functioning?  I understand that you are motivated to help your brother, but it sounds like he needs more intensive intervention than what you would be able to provide on your own.  Unfortunately, I know very little regarding what kinds of services might be available for people like your brother in the UAE.  You might try to find individuals with experience in behavioral modification or functional communication training to help create a behavioral intervention plan.    I know there are mixed opinions about Applied Behavior Analysis in this community, but for lower-functioning individuals, it can make a world of difference in increasing desirable behaviors (e.g., communicating his wants/needs) while decreasing undesirable behaviors (e.g., aggression)."

autism,3dvnr6,choirsofcacophony,3,Mon Jul 20 01:30:23 2015 UTC,Quite often thumb sucking is a sensory stimuli that is enjoyable and acts as a relaxant. My daughter couples it with stroking her nose with a finger but has transferred this to other relaxing stimuli saving thumb sucking for really stressful situations.  It has slightly effected her teeth shape to be honest but the dentist has said it will be correctable without much difficulty. We did try transferring to a wrist bracelet but this wasn't the stimulus she wanted. At least with a try though.

autism,3dlyxh,NutMegabits,21,Fri Jul 17 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"Make sure he knows he's welcome to stim in your home (flap his hands, twirl, rock, hum). If he has a preferred mode of non-verbal communication and it's reasonable for you to do so, make that available to him (I prefer typing, some people might prefer basic body language or drawing or writing).  Speaking as explicitly as you can is also a big plus - like ""we can go to the park later"" is not as good as ""after we both do our homework, we can go to the park to play"". Likewise, routine is helpful (same rituals in the morning to leave the house and in the evening to settle down).  Remember to take care of yourself and give your cousin time to take care of himself as well - a few weeks of living in another household can be a pretty big upheaval both for the person moving and for the household!"
autism,3dlyxh,nadeshdara,10,Fri Jul 17 11:28:19 2015 UTC,Well autism can be very different from person to person but I'll share a couple ones that seem most prevalent.  1. Schedule/prior notice. Let him know what your daily/weekly routine is. Knowing how his life will be organized can be very helpful. Also give him warning on transitions. Such as 10 minutes until dinner... Usually they need more time to switch activities. 2. Hypersensitivity. Try to find out if he is bothered by loud noises... Bright lights... Etc. 3. Can be picky eaters so you might make sure you have some of his favorite foods available. And then of course just remember he's an 11 yr old kid who probably likes to do the things any 11 year old likes to do! Hope the transition goes well for him :-)
autism,3dlyxh,Thessela,5,Fri Jul 17 11:25:57 2015 UTC,"If he's the sort to be inclined, establish a basic routine. Is he verbal? If not learn his communication method (pecs, assistive device, etc.)  Is he susceptible to sensory overload? If so, establish a space to chill, have ear cans that travel everywhere you go and be ready to leave overwhelming situations.  Most of all, he's an 11 yo kid. Do fun things..."
autism,3dlyxh,kashakesh,7,Fri Jul 17 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"His approximate age would be handy to know, and what level he's communicative and/or functional.  Overall, make sure he has a ""safe"" place, as in, a place that's for him and no one enters when he needs his space.  He's likely hypersensitive to all sensory inputs.  That includes touch, don't get hands on with an autistic person unless they initiate it. (you can ask for a hug)  Try to give him some routine.  So much more really, but it would be easier to know what age and functioning level we're talking about.  EDIT: did I completely miss the age in the tittle?"

autism,3dlyxh,SystemFolder,4,Fri Jul 17 17:10:15 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a clear idea of his relationship with food, I'd suggest asking him or his parents ahead of time. Autistic people, especially kids, can be really picky eaters because we're more sensitive to texture and flavor...and something like this isn't the best time to get him to try tons of new foods.  Be very clear about your expectations, even more so than you'd be with an average 11-year-old. If you're giving directions, be prepared to spell them out. (E.g., some people have a harder time understanding ""clean up this mess"" than ""get a wet paper towel and wipe this up, then use a dry paper towel to get rid of the water."") Of course, it depends to an extent on him, as everyone is different."
autism,3dlyxh,cakeisatruth,3,Fri Jul 17 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Find out his favorite shows and have them prerecorded or set up his own profile on Netflix. For food, find out name brands and flavors if he's at all particular.  Like for my son if I just said ""yogurt"" you'd be in trouble if you didn't get Chobani in a very short list of flavors.  Same thing for toiletries. If he's up for it, get information on local attractions and see if he wants to do any of them.  If he gets to go to the Nature & Science museum it would feel more like a vacation instead of ""I'm being shuffled off"". Ask about sleep routine.  You might need a particular routine (my son has special ""bedtime"" lotion and needs his back rubbed), blackout curtains, ceiling fan/no ceiling fan, etc. Ask about how errands are handled at home.  My son (though he's only 5 and has ADHD too) can handle errands if they are spaced with breaks for snacks/random running around/stuff he wants to see.

autism,3dlcuq,Jaguarflesh,2,Sat Jul 18 09:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm happy the State was there to help your son when he needed it. My son was helped by the school district only after 2yrs of medical interventions and pain for the entire family. Because my son was having problems at school and at home, he was moved to a residential school, a campus, about 90 minutes from us.   So, although our situation is a little different - group home vs. ""institution"" - there are similar questions and considerations.   I found this article useful. I hope you do too. http://www.ilresources.com/articles/Grouphomecriteria.html  My observations since dealing with a out of home placement over the past 1 1/2yrs include:   Group home staff can be as unsupported and untrained. So make sure the home you choose invests in its staff and has emergency support measures. Who do group home staff turn to during a violent episode? What kind of training to they have? Is restraint an option?   The residential home where my son resides has very little staff turnover. They do have a restraint method that they have been trained in and can use as needed. Which personnel allowed to restrain him is all outlined in the IEP/residential contract. We get notifications from the caseworker when he has to be restrained and under what circumstances.    Who are the other residents of the group home? Are they compatible with your son.   My son has been moved around a lot at the residential home as they try to pair students who are compatible, around the same age, etc.   How easy is it to changes group homes if there are problems?   Letter published in a newsletter I receive: ""We have an extremely aggressive individual that has caused at least $10k/year in damage to the home he lives in.  The other clients are fearful of him and other family members want him out.  We have a 1:1 and in-home day program (neither of which actually cover the cost of keeping staff, and hiring for these part-time positions is nearly impossible).  SST has been involved and our PAS agent.  We have numerous meetings.  When we suggest he might do better at an organization that can restrain him we are told that the PAS agent won’t even consider it.  I’m also highly skeptical that any other agency would take him.  It’s frustrating because the cost of this client’s care far exceeds what we are paid and there is very little actual support from the division.  We aren’t planning on 'dumping' this client but it is frustrating we have so little support .""   A group home can be like a prison if the child is not equipped to go out in public due to behaviors.    Examples: Is a visit to the pumpkin farm more appropriate than attending a baseball game? If the group home goes to an AMC sensory film, will your son have to sit in the van and wait if he can't tolerate the entire film? Will you son be required to go on an outing with the group even though it isn't appropriate for him?  (These things have all happened to my son. One of the reasons why he is in residential rather than a group home - he has an entire campus to play on and explore. The staff and other students are his community. It is a safe community.)   Maintain contact and lots of oversight. We call every night to talk to staff. We visit every weekend and bring him home over long holidays. Staff may more readily express their needs to you than their employer, then you can better advocate for all of them.    Edit: I just wanted to add that I found it to be a very difficult decision, the guilt almost unbearable, but it has benefited the entire family.   My son has benefited from the strict routines of the residential home in that he has more toileting skills, can dress/undress himself more readily and sometimes will even voluntarily take a shower. :) There are no more 7hr meltdowns. He has bursts of anger where he may be self-injurious, spit or throw things but that's communication. We address those events behaviorally or medically.  He is building relationships with staff and even playing with peers on occasion.   My other children are showing better emotional regulation, fewer maladaptive behaviors and improved school performance. My husband and I are able to focus on living healthier and nurturing our other children knowing that our son with autism is being cared for."

At least we can better understand his maladaptive behaviors whereas while on medications we didn't know what was going on - hallucinations, psychosis or painful side effects. It was horrible. The mania, sleeplessness, meltdowns went on for hours, day and night.   I'm so sorry. I hope you have some help. You shouldn't have to do this alone. Can you get some respite money and, hopefully, find someone to assist NOW while you search for a group home?  We called the police during those rough times...all they could do was refer us to child protective services.

autism,3djpj9,cakeisatruth,2,Thu Jul 16 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"Re: ID card. I'm thinking of bad situations, when an officer isn't just talking to him, but is perhaps commanding him to put his hands up, get on the ground, etc. I do not want him fumbling around in his pockets, and I certainly don't want him holding something towards the officer and/or trying to approach the officer.   As for the other aspect: he wouldn't just forget how to act if an officer was frightening him - he could very easily freak out. I mean, Rain Man-style freaking out. But, I do believe that he could remember to do the hand signal, even if he couldn't get words out or understand what the officer was saying. It's basically the simplest and safest form of communication that I can conceive. We'd teach him to literally stand completely still and just make the V symbol."

autism,3dga5c,jakeschultz13,5,Thu Jul 16 01:10:59 2015 UTC,"He is either having a paranormal experience, has imaginary friends, or ""small girls"" is a euphemism for something. In many cases, euphemisms help us to communicate something or send a message across. A euphemism helps formulate  the message in a way that the speaker understands it, so they don't have to attempt to do in a way that they DON'T understand or comprehend. Unfortunately, this can mean that a lot of things have cryptic meanings or get lost in translations. If you were to ask him what he means by ""small girls,"" would he be able to tell you? Could there be an infestation problem in your house and he is using a familiar term to describe something like ants or cockroaches...which may be unfamiliar to him? He's probably heard the term ""small girls"" to describe children his age, but since he doesn't have a wide enough range of vocabulary, he will use ""small girls"" as a euphemism to describe anything small. Check for tiny uninvited guests of a six-legged variety!"
autism,3dga5c,Rei_Ayanami_00,2,Thu Jul 16 01:25:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response. The cryptic meaning theory makes a lot of sense. Of course the paranormal activity thoughts have crossed my mind but I'm not one to believe in that. As far as the bugs or anything, Max is very quick to tell us when he sees any bug at all no matter where we are at because he is terrified of them.   It makes me feel so bad when he can't figure out how to communicate. He was delayed with speech but now he can hold simple conversations most of the time. When he's worked up it just becomes a whine with no real words but the small girls thing happens when he's completely calm. It's very strange."
autism,3dga5c,cakeisatruth,3,Thu Jul 16 01:34:45 2015 UTC,"I only really have insight for the ""small girls,"" not the first inquiry. People have suggested paranormal activity or imaginary friends, but it could also be atypical perception. Many Autistic people including myself experience psychotic symptoms and there is a lot of overlap between other disorders such as Schizophrenia with Autism (they are neuro-developmentally similar, much like ADD to Autism and OCD to Autism). This isn't to say your son has another disorder, only that it's possible for him to experience similar symptoms even though it is not considered stereotypical or common for Autistic kids to hallucinate or perceive things differently in this way (even though a lot of us actually do! Doctors often don't pay well enough attention, or focus on personal bias or strict criteria...).  Imaginary friends is also possible. I personally never had imaginary friends, as I just couldn't comprehend it I guess and never had such an experience, but I was still very imaginative and would pretend to be beasts and such as a child. So, that's possible too.  Paranormal activity would be the last thing on my mind when questioning the behavior of my neurodivergent child...although my psychosis makes me rather paranoid, I'd rather rationalize and think of other things and causes first!"
autism,3dga5c,AutismFtw,2,Thu Jul 16 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Have you tried giving him an alternative way to express the behavior that doesn't hurt anyone? Such as if he is hitting, give him a pillow or stuffed toy to hit, if he is biting give him a chew toy, etc. There's some advice out there that will say ""just leave him alone to calm down"" - as a person who used to exhibit these behaviors, I beg you, PLEASE don't do that. It can lead to him hurting himself instead because he feels the need to express it on what he has. Do what you have to do to protect yourself, but make sure he's protected as well.  As for the ""small girls"" thing - my first thought was imaginary friends."
autism,3dga5c,SWaspMale,2,Thu Jul 16 01:56:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Yeah we aren't worried about him hurting us when he acts out but himself or other kids.

Most people who seek a diagnosis in adulthood do it because they need accommodations either at work/college, or they need to go on disability. It doesn't sound like that's your situation, though.  If you want a diagnosis because you think it would bring you closure or make you feel better about something, that's absolutely a valid reason, but you don't have to do it immediately if you aren't sure.

I left elementary school campuses many times because I was bullied at school and no one cared or listened. I ran away from home because I was terrified of my father. I ""wandered"" miles from home because I wanted to check out cool nature-stuff that was miles from home.

Nobody is catching autism from touching someone with autism or being sneezed on by someone with autism or breathing in ""autism pathogens"" from the air. Is the increased awareness of autism via a broader classification of symptoms REALLY such a bad thing? Is it really such a bad thing to have more help and resources available to people who would've otherwise been labeled ""eccentric"" and tossed out to the woods?  So now you're going to use the deaths of these children who wandered into the wrong places at the wrong times to show ""Look, guys, autism IS a disease that you can DIE from!"" Stop calling it an epidemic. Until it becomes a pathogenic disease that can actually spread it's not going to be. Until it can be caused by external sources outside of the womb then it's not going to be.   Wandering is a problem and we do need to be made aware of that...so that we can prevent tragic deaths like those in your article by increasing the cautiousness and competence of the people who these children rely on to look after them. However, I don't like the way you used these deaths to sort of compare or label autism as a ""deadly disease"" so that you can justify calling it an epidemic. These tragedies are accidents in the way that a car crash is an accident or a fall is an accident or a nasty run-in with a wild animal is an accident. They do not make autism a lethal disease any more than driving a car is a lethal disease because millions of people die in car crashes. Please focus on accident prevention and cautiousness just like you would with any accident, without acting like it's the symptoms of an ""epidemic disease."""

A significant proportion of autistic kids don't have a sense of danger so can get in life-threatening situations if left to their own devices. But appealing to the long-disproved epidemic rhetoric really isn't helping. Not only is there not really an epidemic (except of massively increased diagnosis), but you're inadvertently reinforcing the image of autism as some horrible disease rather than a legit disability. And if autistic people are to be taken seriously as people (which is necessary to help us effectively), we need rid of that image."

Something that another 'special friend' with autism told me is that ""disability"" indicates ""something that cannot be overcome,"" whereas the term ""challenge"" indicates something that can be overcome, so I would recommend you stick calling what you have ""challenge(s)"" instead of ""disability."" At a special needs camp I work at, one term that we have come up with is ""differently abled"" at least for this tree that we have that doesn't look right, some people might say it looks kind of deformed. To anybody who has recommended that you go on disability, you might want to use what I said above about the terms ""disability"", ""challenge(s)"" or ""differently abled."" to argue why you should NOT go on to disability to get them to go silent on this matter and leave you alone, at least when it comes to this topic. If you can't working during the school semester, then just work on summer vacations and maybe Christmas vacations. That's what I do. I have High Functioning Autism and can't handle working at a job and doing my schoolwork at the same time, so that's why I only work during the summer. I also like to call having autism being ""socially challenged"" and describe certain characteristics that I have as reasoning, not excuses, for why I am not able to or have trouble with doing certain things. I hope that helps. Hang in there, be strong. Don't give up. I think that as somebody who has a disorder on the autism spectrum, you will be able to put your foot down and not give in if you need to."
autism,3de1nk,qtw1,6,Wed Jul 15 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"The online tests aren't really a good indication of whether you have autism, but they're a good indication of whether you should look into getting assessed. Your school's counseling department isn't qualified to diagnose you, although they might be able to give you a referral to somewhere else.  Look for a psychologist, psychiatrist, or autism specialist in your area (preferably one covered by insurance as paying out of pocket can be very expensive). You'll need to look for one specifically experienced in working with adults, as many of them only assess children. How they'll determine the diagnosis really depends. It might be a simple verbal or written checklist, or a series of tests. Best to ask ahead of time."
autism,3de1nk,cakeisatruth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"Someone else posted a very similar question a few days ago, so I'll tell you the same thing I told them. Click through to the link about why not to see a GP for my recommendations on how to go about getting assessed.    Short answer: It means it might be a good idea to see a specializing psychologist.  Long answer: The AQ and similar tests, like the RAADS-R, are screening tools. Like all tests they have a margin of error. Current diagnostic rate is 2.5% if you're male, 0.5% if you're female. So, if you knew nothing else, that is the base likelihood that you're on the spectrum. A positive result on the AQ (score over 32) increases that likelihood by, roughly, a factor of 10.  So if you're male, that means there's as much as a 1 in 4 chance you're on the spectrum. That's confounded by a lot of other factors though. The AQ is designed to be administered by a mental health professional. Administering it yourself introduces an unquantifiable margin of error into the results. So the real statistical likelihood is somewhere below 25%.  There are other tests, but most have similar specificity/sensitivity to the AQ. So you're not going to really narrow down the real statistical certainty  much more by taking other tests. If you need more certainty, I would recommend seeing a qualified psychologist (don't go to a GP), and perhaps reading a bit more about autism (I recommend this book) so that you can go into the appointment prepared for what kinds of questions will be asked.  All that being said, if you're an adult without a lot of difficulties formal diagnosis doesn't really do a lot for you, and can be quite expensive. This book lays out some of the pros/cons and other options available to you."

It seems likely to me that they exclude a large percentage of people who grew up before all the late 90's/early 2000's changes in diagnosis/awareness and went undiagnosed. That wouldn't skew statistics if it was random, but there's likely some correlation between ""those who can pass well enough to go undiagnosed"" and ""those who can pass well enough to keep a job"". I expect actual unemployment is still likely higher for autistics than neurotypicals, but not quite as high as many of the statistics indicate.  Again, not trying to detract from what you're saying in this article.

The study only gathered data from youth who were getting special education services in 2000 when the study began. ... This means our findings are not able to tell the story of youth with autism who were not in special education or who were served through other eligibility categories like intellectual disability.

I managed to locate the Drexel report, and although I am still reading it, it does seem that the data is older than you think.  The report states: ""As in our scientific articles, the outcomes figures in this report are primarily derived from the NLTS2 and generalize to all U.S. youth who were ages 13-16 and enrolled in special education at the study’s start in 2001.""  It also states:  ""This report is based primarily on our analyses of data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2). The NLTS2 was a national study begun in 2000-2001 that captured the experiences of youth who received special education from the time they were in high school into adulthood. The last wave of data collection in 2009, when youth were 21-25 years of age, is the best currently available source of national data about the experiences and outcomes of youth with disabilities, including autism.""

autism,3d53id,mysuperfakename,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"There are services that help autistic individuals find work. His expectations might be more of a challenge. Do you feel like his problem with work is not being able to do it or not being able to work with people. Can he use his degree with accommodations? A job coach would be able to help with these questions.   He is an adult and he is the one who needs to make the choices, not you. You can explain that you can't keep supporting him. You can give him a day to move out. You can point him to potential job help, but you can't make him go.   As far as group homes, it doesn't sound like that is a level of care he needs. The folks I work with in group homes need constant supervision. Whether that is for severe hygiene issues, food issues, or general safety. It sounds like he needs help with vocation, transportation, and possibly housekeeping. A case manager would be able to get these things set up pretty quickly once he gets his diagnosis. For getting a case manager, Google disability services in your area. There are private organizations that help with jobs (shredding and housekeeping mostly) and there is the state agency that likely has a job training program.  I hope that helps."

autism,3d53id,k955301,2,Thu Jul 16 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"I recently ran a global team of 14 IT workers. Your family member sounds like a guy I had to remove from the team. He manipulated his way into the industry from a call center on an executives mentoring program. The program had no screening for capability and the call center was closed, a perfect storm. This guy would cut and paste Java code into a SQL client and then hunt someone down to figure out why it didn't work. My role was different from yours - it was to remove him so he didn't continue to negatively affect the teams speed or morale.  Moreover, I also have a son on the spectrum, and can appreciate your experience - supporting another human being will probably tip you over the edge financially.  Okay, with introductions out of the way, here are some tips:   you're spot on about his lack of skill affecting his tendency to overinflated: here is a paper explaining Your blunt assessment is spot on - the learning curve isn't a curve, it's a wall. He won't get over it without first fixing the fundamentals That diagnosis is your key to first pulling him off your budget. If you are going to help him, you can't drive yourself into the ground trying. Depending on the state you're in, the help will be different. If his parents had social security contributions, they may apply to him through Medicaid. If you don't get the diagnosis, you're going to need more support. Fix the funding issue first (state programs, or other family), then the strategy.   Does he have a full degree or something vocational? From your writeup it doesn't sound like CS or CE. Sometimes these programs have job placement.  /u/PapaDave130 mentioned being blunt. That's great advice - partly to help him, but also to manage your own energy. Be aware that his response (people who have picked up on this behavior as a profession are fantastic at it I'm afraid) will usually be an attempt to extend the amount of time he doesn't have to do any work. Ignoring you for days is a great example - it's work to confront your fears. At 40, he's an expert.  Once you have funding worked out, another thought is to visually describe the plan. One approach could be to list several jobs, starting with one he thinks he can do but can't (I would use one of those that didn't go well so you can avoid a repeat), then increasing easier ones. Explain that you'll help him get a job on this list, but he has to do the rest. Each time he fails, go to the next one. Here is an example:   Programmer system administrator service desk hotel it support hotel front desk   Here - at an IT role in a specific industry is your pivot. You may try to find an industry that is interesting to him where you can remove the IT aspect and get him to focus on the industry. Hospitality, or a university are an excellent ones - plenty of job types. Also, there are vocational training programs - (here is one after a quick lookup](http://naf.org/about-naf)  tl;dr - outsource the sentences you started with ""I ..."" that involve lifting him up. There are organizations that do this - some for funding, some for jobs, some for independence. Fix funding first, then get him into an industry and a program that helps people in his situation.  Also... you are an awesome person for trying to find a way and not throwing him out on the streets!  edit: replaced my dumb armchair diagnosis with something more helpful."
autism,3d53id,nelleker,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:10 2015 UTC,He has a Bachelors degree from ITT. I don't know how difficult their degree programs are or how current they are though.   Thank you so much for your reply!  He was in the military and has veteran status so we are reaching out to the VA for housing. I'm hopeful on that front. We can help him furnish a small place and get him set up. He will need a place on a bus route.   The biggest issue is his lack of self awareness. He truly has a total disconnect from reality. It's not an easy thing to deal with. He often tries to convince us of things that simply are not true. He told me he was married to a woman he definitely wasn't married to. It's bizarre.   He also has a serious issue with hypochondria. He asks to go to the ER for things like big bites or a mild fever. He will truly believe that he is dying. We stopped driving him and he has stopped asking and only took an ambulance once. Progress? We hope!
autism,3d53id,AutismFtw,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"I would say that you should help him access disability services in your area after he gets his diagnosis. Usually they help with job placement. Also, I would recommend encouraging him to try volunteering, that way he can get practical experience and learn to interact with others. Another thing would be to ask your friends if they need some odd jobs done that your brother could help them with/do and if they could pay your brother a small amount for doing them."
autism,3d53id,PapaDave130,2,Tue Jul 14 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"I have High Functioning Autism. I think that my own personal experience is I really love singing and I want to be an autism consultant in a few years. However, sometimes when I'm wanting to sing and do it, it might end up being solos, which my parents discourage because I have a choir quality voice, not soloist. I want to be an autism consultant, but there are certain areas I am lacking in that are not the academic knowledge or problem-solving skills but I am relying so much on the fact that I'm autistic and my autism intuition and problem-solving skills that I don't give enough attention and recognition to where I am lacking. I'm saying this all to say that I think that this 40-year-old man might be coming from a similar place that I am on singing and autism consulting. He really loves IT stuff, is probably pretty knowledgeable and good at it, and wants to do it his own way but doesn't acknowledge the areas he's weak in and doesn't want to do it other people's way. I can't really tell you how to help him to lower his standards when it comes to his job because when my parents do it with me bluntly and forcefully and firmly I'm still resistant and somewhat adamant. I would have to maybe talk to my mom and dad and get their advice on this issue. I thought I would at least comment and help you with getting his perspective since I think he and I might have a somewhat similar one.

autism,3d3vtj,Narkuza,6,Mon Jul 13 08:54:10 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different, and everyone with autism is different on top of that. I think as anybody grows up, we're less likely to be comfortable with who we are if we felt separated or isolated growing up. Sadly, this happens often to people with ASDs.  My sister is 21, and was working through this same thing a few years ago. Now, she has her identity, but feels uncomfortable with her friendships and daily life. She's worrying that life is passing her by and that she's not truly ""living"" it. But it's mostly her autism-related anxieties that lead her to those thoughts.  But just remember: people with autism and people without it both struggle with these things, including their identity. Try to keep an open mind! If you feel like nothing sticks, try opening up about it to a counselor, therapist, psychologist, friend, or family member. You'll have the most success with someone to support you in achieving that goal.  Best of luck :)"

autism,3d3vtj,TryingToAdjust,3,Mon Jul 13 14:35:25 2015 UTC,"This is kind of an issue with people in our generation (and I'm early 30s). Look, the whole idea - Man's search for meaning and all that - is probably not the best idea for people like us. We need to look at the hard facts of what is necessary. How do we get money and pay our own rent and stuff.   When I was a young person I had a lot of special interests and people told me to major in the liberal arts and stuff like that. But then I realized that as a person on the spectrum I was subject to similar limitations (cultural fit etc) as the immigrants in my family who are a poor cultural fit because of their foreignness.   So during the middle of college I was like, I can't do this pre-med thing (What I was being pushed toward) and changed my major to business. For the past couple of years I have been working in a job that my NT friends make fun of me for, accounting.   A lot of my NT friends were into stuff like Occupy Wall Street, Feminism / minority studies, Goth and stuff like that. You can see the conflict there. People were like LOLOL ur taking corporate finance. But you see I didn't have a choice. I had to because ppl on the spectrum are the first to be fired, the last to be fired. NTs can just swan into a job and be hired through the power of social skills.   The way I dress is not really an identity thing but a calculated maneuver. I read sites like Bossip.com and other celebrity gossip sites to see what ""hot"" and ""cute"" girls (i.e. the Housewives shows) wear so that I can emulate them. For example I get my makeup and fashion tips from Kim Kardashian and Rihanna but I dress more modestly with skinny jean (slacks for work).   When I dress this way and keep my BMI in a thin range, people treat me better. I make sure my nails are done with a glossy fast drying top coat and I am wearing makeup every day or at least my brows are on point. I go to stores like: Forever 21 and Rainbow. For a man the equivalent clothes stores are VIM, Dr Jay and any store that says ""Jeanswear"".   Even though I like the Goth culture and am active on websites like Metal Archives, dressing Goth is deleterious toward people respecting you unless it's one or two gothic accents in daily wear. I play in a metal band and I don't even dress goth unless it's for stage wear because there is a tattooed guy in the scene who is probably on the spectrum, and some metal musicians make fun of him like they call him deathcore (a poseur).   I suggest that as a young man, you should shop at stores like VIM, American Eagle, H&M and other places that are considered cool, instead of being too adventurous. Also you should get a haircut in a basic cut such as shape ups, the Caesar etc and apply gel to your hair so that it looks well groomed. For work I would get some button down shirts from H&M as well as black and grey slacks.   For hobbies and interests, I suggest trying to watch sports as well as something productive such as computer programming or playing an instrument. People like it when you play an instrument or create some sort of art and it can help you to meet friends."

autism,3d0qym,amipow,8,Mon Jul 13 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the questions! I never changed, and thank goodness for it! ;) My special interests became my favorite hobbies, my college major, my career. For autistic kids, so many things need to be TAUGHT that come naturally to other kids. These things include eye contact, opening your eyes all the way, how to express different emotions, how to be verbal. I became verbal at a later age than my neurotypical siblings. My parents were patient with me, which I appreciated, but they also cajoled me into speaking, which I appreciate in retrospect. The hard part was school, because teachers had little patience for ""not participating."" Being proactive about speech and socializing is important for parents, but not too much, or it gets stressful. Remember that the best way to calm an autistic kid down is to leave him/her alone to self-stimulate. Make sure the self-stimulation is not self-harming, though. For me, I would itch excessively (bad), but I would also play tennis against the wall by myself (good). I think the best thing a parent can give an autistic kid is a big wall where they can kick a ball against it, or a swing to swing on. Something relaxing. The best thing you can communicate is that, no matter how many tantrums and tough moments he/she has, you will love them through it. And that's something that can be communicated through any number of words and actions that I'm sure you express every day."

What seems like it may be more likely is that something small and to a neurotypcal seems to be insignificant has caused the reaction. Things tend to be black or white to those with ASD - so there's either unafraid or terrified, there's no middle ground of ""slightly afraid"". Or another thing to consider is it may be a sensory issue - something you don't realize is causing him sensory overload and is overwhelming him.

If this continues over a period of a few weeks it's probably a good idea to get him screened for anxiety disorder.

I have High Functioning Autism and am a psychology major with an Abnormal Psychology and other psychology classes under my belt. Is your son taking any medicine or dietary supplements for anything related to his autism or medicine that is for calming him, anxiety issues, or depression issues? The reason why I ask is because my autistic boyfriend was having hallucinations because of medicine he was taking for the reasons of calming him, anxiety, or depression.  Hallucinations (I think both the visual and audio kind) are a symptom of schizophrenia, so you might want to go see a psychologist to see if the psychologist think he has that psychological disorder or another disorder besides autism. I definitely agree that autism is not characterized by hallucinations, so I'm not trying to say now that is characterized by them. See if the psychologist ends up diagnosing him with schizophrenia or some other psychological disorder other than autism and see if the psychologist will prescribe him medicine or some other kind of therapy. Definitely pay attention to anything they say about what possible causes are of some psychological disorders and you might be able to ask questions about schizophrenia and other stuff, but they might ask you a bunch of questions.  You might want to ask your son to draw pictures of what he sees in the hallucinations, if that won't be too scary for him. It might be interesting for see what the pictures are or at least have you describe to me what he drew in the pictures, it would be great if you would have him do what I already stated in this paragraph and if you would private message me about the pictures.   I have very limited, maybe no availability the next few days as I will be rather ability with a couple of different kinds of things, but if I have any time to spare to check for private messages and comments and respond, I will. At the latest, I will be able to communicate more about this on this weekend, I think. If you end up having him draw pictures of his hallucinations and you end up taking him to a psychologist, will you please let me know how that goes and what was said and/or drawn?"
autism,3d3ag7,cakeisatruth,5,Mon Jul 13 06:04:01 2015 UTC,"While schizophrenia is a possibility, there's no need to jump right to the worst-case scenario. Child-onset schizophrenia is extremely rare, to the point where professionals will generally rule out every other possibility before they even consider it. It also includes many more situations besides hallucinations (if that's indeed what OP's son is experiencing), and symptoms have to be present for at least a few weeks before it would be diagnosed. More commonly it would be months and months."

I would say that my recommendation is take your son to the psychologist to get screened for all of the different psychological disorders that are out there, just to make sure that we aren't as likely to miss anything, besides doing what I already said in the above post. If after doing everything I and others have suggested still doesn't work and your answer to all my questions is ""No"", please private message me and I might be able to do something additional to help.

You can't write a character to have a number of characteristics in common with an existing condition and then, with no explanation why they behave that way, just assume they don't have it.  It's like Rajesh on Big Bang theory, saying he doesn't have selective mutism because ""he wasn't written to have it.""  Well, he certainly acts and behaves like he does and, the important part, there's no other explanation for why he behaves that way.  Any thinking person would have to make the assumption he does indeed have selective mutism and would have to make the assumption that Schrute falls somewhere on the autism spectrum."
autism,3d1vib,ASonthePrairies,2,Mon Jul 13 02:22:49 2015 UTC,"Raj has selective mutism it's explained in the first season, and referenced throughout the series until it's cured by having a broken heart.   A fictional character only exists within the confines of the information we are given. The writers in big bang for example say Sheldon doesn't have autism because they don't want to have to work within the rules of that specific disorder. So there you go he doesn't have autism."
autism,3d1vib,GrammerPants,2,Mon Jul 13 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Actually, early on, when they did the initial pilot with Katie (Amanda Walsh), not Penny, the writers said they did create Sheldon as an autistic character and the actor, Jim Parsons, studied autistic individuals as a guide.  But when they retooled (In the pilot and the first part of season 1, the humour is mostly derived from the interaction of Sheldon and Leonard with regular people, but mid season 1 and on, the laughter is directed from laughing at Sheldon) the people behind the show realized that making fun of Sheldon could be interpreted as mocking someone with a disability.  So they publicly announced that Sheldon was not autistic, only that he behaved like in autistic person is almost all of his mannerisms so they wouldn't have to deal with the problem.  But it's immaterial.  They don't say 'selective mutism', they say ""Raj is shy with girls"", but it's still quite obvious that's what it is.  And they don't say Sheldon is 'autistic', they say ""He's weird"" but he expresses characteristics completely consistent with autism."

Many children like the funny pictures and rhymes. There are several books on other topics in the series that are also very fun.   Cheryl J Meiners M.Ed wrote a terrific series of social stories on a variety of topics including working through anger and taking turns.   I'm not sure about anything specifically about communication without knowing a little more of in what context you would like to build this skill. ie. Are you more concerned that he is not replying to your questions or that he is not showing interest in continuing the conversation?  Also if you haven't explored it yet, there are several apps and websites that will help you to write social stories. This can be a great option because it personalizes the situation and it is much easier to generalize to his own life."
autism,3cyyv4,georgelass,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"I am worried about both of those topics. Right now he seems to like to direct all conversations. As in he will talk about his car. He will prompt me to ask questions. if I do not he will keep telling me to ask the question or he will get upset. I generally will play along because at least he is talking which he did not do. I would love for him to respond more to questions as well as be able to have conversations about things that others want.  I have not explored it yet. He was diagnosed the 8th so right now it's been productive spurts with a lot of downtime. i'm trying really hard to catch up and try to help him while caring for my 2 month old son.  Thank you so so so much for your input though! He is very literal so the fruit book is neat! I also love the taking turns and working through feelings. I try really hard to get him through his feelings but sometimes I am not sure if he knows more than happy, mad and sad with others. He will now express being mad by saying GRRR I'M MAD which despite my efforts I believe he learned from daniel tiger. Happy you have to smile a big one, mad you have to be REALLY upset and sad unless there are tears he doesn't understand. Like if I am upset he did something I feel like he doesn't get that I am ""upset."" It is why I think he has a hard time learning not to do things he shouldn't like climb in his brother's crib etc."
autism,3cyyv4,georgelass,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:06:55 2015 UTC,"I am so happy to help! You brought up a lot of different topics here so I will do my best to address them all. I'm sorry if it turns out to be very long but I promise it is all important.   A speech therapist would be able to help with most of your challenges. If your son is 3 and has received the autism diagnosis, you may be eligible for help through your school district depending on where you live.   So generally children on the spectrum have a challenging time with perspective taking. This is why he may be having trouble talking about what others want. This can tie in very closely with emotions and building empathy. I believe that people are unable to understand the emotions of others without first understanding emotions within themselves. As an example, it is challenging to understand anger in others if you do not first understand what anger feels like in yourself. This is why you being upset may not have a large impact on him.   I feel like saying, ""GRR. I'M MAD,"" is an appropriate way to express anger at this age. If you would like him to react differently, you can shape the behavior by showing how you would like him to express this in a social story about what is appropriate.  In building language it is important to understand how children build language typically. Motivation is a big part of communication for children (ie. if it's not meaningful to them it's not worth talking about). This is why play can be a prime opportunity to build language.   The first rule of building language during play is to do what you can to make the game even more fun because you are there. Just jump in and make it fun. For example, when a student was interested in playing with cars, we would have a race in which I would animate the noise of the cars or what the announcer would say. It was silly but it built the social connection.   Once the rapport was built, the student was much more open to when I would change the way we played. It is important to vary the play a little to help your son learn to be flexible. Yes in an ideal world, things would go perfectly right all the time but in the real world, there will be hiccups and it is important to teach him to realize this and that things will be ok. Don't do this as a big shock but work on it slowly over time with that goal in mind. This will also help him to be more flexible with peers and to build friendships eventually and you may even show him a new way to play.   I hope I answered most of your questions without it all being too overwhelming. I know that an autism diagnosis can be a lot to take in and all of the information afterward can be impossible to navigate. Let me know if you have any others now or in the future about anything from school to therapies to writing social stories.   TL;DR Motivation is key for successful two way conversation. If he doesn't care about the activity or what you bring to play, he won't be interested in talking about it."
autism,3cyyv4,ASonthePrairies,2,Sun Jul 12 06:57:25 2015 UTC,"When I was three, my favorite book was Strange Stories, Amazing Facts.  I would spend hours going over every part of that book.  Each of the stories or facts are only a few pages long, some not even a full page, with illustrations.  Now, I might not suggest that exact book because some parts are quite adult and inappropriate for a child that age.  But that style of book is what you should be looking for.  Bite depth bits of knowledge.  It helps keep you from hyper-focusing like you would with a full book.  Just expect him to memorize it. :)   Any good books to teach him that we can leave something we really like to finish another task and go back to it?   I'm in my thirties, and someday I hope to find someone or someway to learn that. :)  Even now, I have to consciously break from tasks.  And the whole time I've broken from it... You know the feeling you get when you think you might've left the iron on when you go out?  That task feels like that in the back of my mind until I can return to it.  I'm not trying to be discouraging.  I'm proof that your son will someday be able to understand the concept.  But I am telling you that can be a very deep tendency and I don't think there's any simple book that can teach that.  It's something you will need to work with him on, and understand that it creates stress in him."
autism,3czx1x,zorro1701e,9,Sun Jul 12 08:23:57 2015 UTC,"You can't really make people 'get used to' sensory issues. His nervous system is wired in a way that makes stimuli stronger or more painful for him than it is for others - no amount of exposure or practise will change that.  Covering his ears and closing his eyes is his way of coping with that stimulation. He's taking care of himself by doing what he needs to stay comfortable - that's not a bad thing. But if you want to make things easier for him, you can help him to avoid unpleasant sensory situations (like warn him that there's going to be cheering so that he has the option to step outside), or help him block out stimuli when it happens (like let him use ear defenders when it's loud)."
autism,3czx1x,wkpaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:30:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. I just wanted to get a better understanding. Obviously he has no interest in a dance recital.  I noticed same sensory issue on the 4th of July with fireworks.  But he quickly opened his eyes and uncovered his ears because it interested him.
autism,3czx1x,nadeshdara,2,Sun Jul 12 13:54:00 2015 UTC,"I find the sensation of someone else reaching for me and protecting me very soothing, because the warmth and firm touch of another's hand registers very differently. Since he's young, this might also be good because it will re-affirm that he is allowed to protect himself when a noise comes.  Ask him about whether he might like that, and try it out in private without the stressor first with his consent.  In general, having control over the situation (by being able to cover your ears, by being able to pause a recording etc.) makes first contact easier. Watching a recording of a situation to prep him for it before he goes into it so he knows the script might help him get the ""jump scares"" out of the way so he can go into the situation more relaxed."

Thinking of each sense separately, then figuring out how to manipulate each one when they get overstimulated -- that's the key. Also, teach him to hold his breath when he passes something smelly."
autism,3czx1x,ASonthePrairies,2,Sun Jul 12 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"These are great suggestions. Also, shirts or jackets with a hood can be really helpful for visual overstimulation. One that's just a little bit too big is like blinders on a horse - it removes excess input."

The clapping was an unusual response but not unheard of. Seems like reading responses and a few private messages and talking to his ABA therapist. Seems like he just needs a combination of prep and allowing him the ability to cover if it's a bit too much.
autism,3czx1x,verfmeer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"I would use some headphones or something to help. If he's uncomfortable, he's going to hate going. It's okay for him to look different. All people are different and have different needs. And though you can't force someone to ""get used to"" things, I will say that in my experience, it does get better with time and exposure to different situations. I think sometimes, though, just the experience of being near a crowd makes things seem louder. For me, though I've not had a diagnosis of autism, if I'm already stressed out, noises just seem louder and more grating to my senses. It's more difficult to handle stimulation when you've got SO MUCH going on."
autism,3czx1x,tmprod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:55:49 2015 UTC,Give him the time to stim and get it out- the sensory he needs. As long as he is not hurting himself he needs to get the sensory.

Note that this is only applicable if the therapists pulling services are board certified. If your consultant, who should be board certified, is pulling services entirely, this is very concerning.   Terminating treatment should only be done in cases wherein the child no longer needs the therapy, if you as parents decide to end therapy, or if therapy is causing harm in any way. The bias of refusing to work based on the child's school placement is very unprofessional.   Source: behavior therapist, not yet certified but on her way."

Behavior analysts discontinue a professional relationship in a timely manner when the client: (1) no longer needs the service, (2) is not benefiting from the service, (3) is being harmed by continued service, or (4) when the client requests discontinuation.

autism,3cxip3,aje1121,8,Tue Jul 14 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"As a former ABA therapist who now is a special education teacher in a school I find it very out of line for the therapist to refuse services because they don't like the school your child goes to. Your child's care is a team effort and collaboration. It should be a collaboration of all of his caregivers to determine what services (ABA, school, etc) is best for him! Is she refusing services because the hours would be reduced upon his return to school? I have seen this done many times before due to certain ABA company or insurance minimum hour rules...or is she simply refusing because she doesn't like the school? In the end, YOU know you child the best and have the ultimate decision in the path you choose for him! Having worked on both sides, I know how awesome and beneficial it can be for kids to have a solid team from different agencies providing supports and services in collaboration! Not sure if this response is helpful, but if you have any other questions or would like some input on how to maybe facilitate a conversation with the therapist or his school let me know :)"

I do understand that for therapist it is frustrating if parents/school/etc. do not follow or want to implement the intervention that we have put in place, as that does make it harder when intervention is not being used in all settings.  However, since you have switched schools, I think the therapist should continue services for that brief period. But that is my personal opinion. Hope this helps!"

autism,3cxip3,abaucom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:04:38 2015 UTC,"It may have something to do with insurance, as well. Unfortunately, a lot of clinics can't provide as many, if any, services for a child who is in mainstream school. If he or she is part of a licensed group, it may be out of their hands because if the clinic/therapist can't get paid one way or another, they cannot provide therapy. If it is someone who operates alone, then I would assume they have free reign, in which case it is an utter failure of that individual. But again and depending on the situation, insurance will not cover a child for any reasonable amount of therapy if they are enrolled in a public school.  I don't agree with it, either."

He works hard enough to keep it together at school. We have Speech, OT, and social skills instruction at school. He needs to just be a KID at home. And I'm okay with the kid he is. I guess that's the difference. He does so many awesome things as the autistic kid he is. I don't want to change that. Not one bit.

There's no options to do less unless you want to flat out decline the service - you must do 21h and make up any missing hours even. Friend's son did well in the program by attending only 1/2 days of school and spending half of his day in therapy instead but towards the end he was a irritable, grumpy little guy. It really turns out that he was exhausted - and who wouldn't be! When he was discharged from the program he was less stressed. It was in the long-run beneficial because he learned so much but it's really stupid that we don't have an option to take the number of hours we want or feel we need. We're currently doing 5 hours a week with our daughter and she's learning some great skills there. In another 2 years her name will finally make it to the top of the waitlist and I really don't know what I'll do at that point - 21 hours a week will be too much for her especially since she'll be in grade 1 at the time."
autism,3cpdbv,malica77,6,Fri Jul 10 18:44:40 2015 UTC,"Hi entwederoder. I know there are a lot of comments on here, but I wanted to add in my perspective and solutions as a person with High Functioning Autism. Oh and to many of you people who have been commenting on this post: I know that many of you strongly dislike ABA, but besides telling entwederoder that ABA is bad and throwing that out the window as a solution, could you please come up with an alternate solution to replace ABA to help this parent more? I don't like it when several of you are naysaying ABA as a solution and not giving an alternate solution. I realize that I make the same mistake but just with different things, but hopefully we can all work on this together or individually.  Like some people have already been saying, you don't need to make the goal to make your son indistinguishable from neurotypicals. I would definitely be on the side of others who say 40 hours a week of ABA isn't necessary (to at least say it as an understatement). I think that in a comment on one of the posts of this week, somebody has already said that once school starts up, there is occupational, speech, and physical therapy and maybe social skills training available through the school, which I suppose is true. One good friend I have has said to me that sometimes she can't tell/forgets that I have autism (and she does know that I have autism) and frequently when my mom has told people that I have autism, people will say, ""Oh, I didn't know that."" This could be occurring because I have had the High Functioning kind of autism essentially my whole life. Therefore, if your son gets to the point of being high functioning, he might be able to eventually, at least some times come off as indistinguishable from his peers or not autistic. Make the point instead of his being indistinguishable from his peers to rather be let him be his own unique self while still working on overcoming as much as possible all the weaknesses of his autism. Make the 40 hours of working with autism instead be stuff you're doing at home to help him with his autism and people at school giving him services, like both you and the school giving him social skills training, occupational therapy, and living/life skills training. The training in various importance skills and social nuances can be something you do as a natural part of the day so that you can train him and teach him skills as he goes throughout his day instead of scheduling certain blocks in his day for going off to ABA therapy. You might want to look into seeing if colleges near you have a volunteer program where the college students are working with kids with autism from the local community. I know of at least one college in Michigan where there is such a program for college students to work with kids with High Functioning Autism K-12th grade. I know about this program from a psychology professor at Spring Arbor University who runs this program.  Edit: Moved a sentence asking people to not knock down ABA therapy and offer no alternate solutions to earlier in the paragraph and wrote ""Oh and to many of the people who have been commenting on this post:""."
autism,3cpdbv,AutismFtw,7,Sat Jul 11 06:14:55 2015 UTC,"ABA has helped my grandson considerably.  However, he also has therapy with a speech pathologist, mental health therapist, speech language provider and occupational therapist.  ABA is just one piece in the puzzle for us."
autism,3cpdbv,rebelreligion,8,Thu Jul 9 22:16:43 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Even if it could (and it likely won't), it's not a good idea. Why treat your perfectly good autistic child like a defective neurotypical?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but usually this kind of thing means forcing eye contact (which is outright painful for us) and eliminating harmless stims (one of our biggest coping skills). Trust me, that does not send the messages you want to give your child. In a lot of ways, ABA is little more than compliance training. If you're trying to treat more problematic behaviors like head-banging or fecal smearing, that's a different situation (though I still wouldn't recommend ABA), but based on your wording I'm guessing that isn't it.  You might want to read more on why ABA is so controversial. Here's a very thorough post, and here's another. The second is from a former therapist.  Also, 40 hours a week? That's as much as a full-time job! No kindergartener should be subjected to that. Consider this: the average five-year-old should be getting 10 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Twelve hours of sleep plus eight hours of ABA, as well as time for meals, transportation, hygiene and personal care, and your child gets what - an hour a day to relax and just be a kid, if that? Even a grown adult should have more than that.  There are so many other options available to you depending on what your child needs to work on, and once he enters kindergarten, you can set up an IEP so he receives many of them for free. (The school district is legally required to provide him with a free appropriate public education, which includes services necessary.) Speech therapy, AAC devices, occupational therapy, extended school year, life skills classes, social skills groups, DIR/floortime, special education classes if he needs it, etc. There's no reason to limit yourself or him to just ABA.  Sorry if this comes off as too forceful, it's just a sensitive subject. Bottom line: It's OK for your child to be autistic. Really it is. A lot of society will jump right to telling you it needs to be ""fixed."" It doesn't. Yes, he needs to learn to get along in the world, but that doesn't require being neurotypical, nor does it require 40 hours of therapy a week."
autism,3cpdbv,cakeisatruth,5,Thu Jul 9 19:00:04 2015 UTC,ABA therapy does not take away a child's Autism and to suggest otherwise is a fallacy.
autism,3cpdbv,JustMadeThisNameUp,5,Thu Jul 9 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean it takes away a person's autism. It just works to make some of the symptoms less visible, like stimming or lack of eye contact. Not to the autistic person's benefit, mind you, but to make them ""look more normal."""
autism,3cpdbv,cakeisatruth,0,Thu Jul 9 23:59:07 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see any documentation or videos that signify ABA therapy is used to make a person with Autism ""look more normal"".   I've seen ABA therapy used to help children with Autism learn to use to recognize shapes and faces, used to develop fine and gross motor skills, and to speak. But never to ""look more normal""."
autism,3cpdbv,JustMadeThisNameUp,5,Fri Jul 10 01:00:45 2015 UTC,"I won't pretend to know 100% what all they were trying to accomplish, but when my son was first diagnosed (6 years ago) and we toured specialized preschools, they definitely emphasized how they would make him indistinguishable from peers.  That was very clearly their goal.  Since my son didn't have the kinds of obvious stimming behaviors I think that /u/cakeisatruth is talking about, this kind of thing didn't really come up in my conversations with the staff about specifically what they would do.  However, when we toured the preschool, the woman giving the tour pointed at a classroom of children and proudly invited me to tell the difference.  They repeatedly expressed pride and joy at how the children would be ""indistinguishable.""  I believe that was the precise word they used, to be honest.   It gave me the creeps, and it's one of the reasons we didn't send our child there.  Another preschool we looked at, run by the Emory Autism Center, was less creepy but also that was certainly a theme.  I agree they focused a lot on skill acquisition, but those skills included things like giving high 5s.    Now, there's nothing wrong with giving high 5s, and I'm not going to knock that school because I think lots of people had great experiences there.    they were very helpful to us in other ways, and I learned that you have to take what you need (think you need) and leave the rest.  So, for example, they taught us the importance of very frequent communication, staying connected.  not forced on the child, but just staying present with the child, and not checking out ourselves when he did.  I really appreciate learning that.  However, the ability to give a high 5 was not high on our priority list.  I can't remember if they said anything about forcing eye contact or hugging, /u/cakeisatruth, to be honest, I'm not sure how widespread that is anymore.  I Know it was really common previously, but I sort of got the feeling that it was fading away?  I have seen materials that felt otherwise kind of conventional that did say not to try to force the child.  So I think maybe some progress is being made .... maybe?"
autism,3cpdbv,nyx1969,2,Fri Jul 10 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"If the school is literally trying to sell you on what they're doing with the goal of making your child ""indistinguishable"" then you should run. As for me I've never experienced anything like that. I'm not saying I've encountered any perfect school. Far from it, I've actually seen some schools that were run by people who had no business working with people with Autism. It was just a job for them and I could tell that they weren't the right fit for it. I'm not saying people need to know everything there is about Autism in order to work for people with Autism but they need to have the right priorities.  I've been in a public school where I saw one teenaged student with Autism be prompted for high fives frequently. It is not something that should have been done. When students without Autism go through out their every day routine without giving high fives it's inappropriate to make someone with Autism do it.   It's hokey, awkward and not at all genuine. And I feel the student with Autism who was prompted with the high five knew it. He is non-verbal but I could tell it was not the best thing for him.   High fives are more of something that is to help very young children but even then it's only to have them start the process of communicating physically.   ABA therapy when done correctly is just to get the child to move in the world. To speak, to express themselves. When done properly ABA therapy helps those with severe Autism symptoms help take control of their own life. It's important because enabling them to be non-verbal and to be unable to feed themselves or take care of their person is setting themselves up for problems later in life. I constantly hear parents' fears of ""What will happen to my son/daughter when I'm not around."""
autism,3cpdbv,JustMadeThisNameUp,3,Sat Jul 11 05:13:01 2015 UTC,"Forced eye contact, forcing a child to hug/kiss parents, and extinguishing harmless stimming are all things that solely exist to make a child seem ""less autistic."" And these are often goals of ABA therapy."
autism,3cpdbv,cakeisatruth,0,Fri Jul 10 01:10:30 2015 UTC,And they are often not the goals. ABA is just a tool. It's never been used to prevent those things in my house and it never will be.

autism,3cpdbv,GrammerPants,0,Fri Jul 10 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"That's not at all the purpose behind such practices. I'll have to verify this forcing of hugging and kissing parents but the idea behind prompting and rewarding is to help the child learn how to communicate (in this case non-verbally).  Eye contact is something that can help a child relay their needs and desires, it's an important thing to be able to do. Parents/teachers are not mind readers and they require eye contact just like every person, those who have Autism or not. Enabling a child with Autism to not make eye contact hurts more than it helps.  I've never seen someone prohibit a child with Autism from stimming during ABA therapy. Redirection is of course not unheard of but that's not prohibiting."

autism,3cpdbv,GrammerPants,6,Thu Jul 9 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think most people think ABA here is ""literally worse than Hitler"", even taking that statement as hyperbolic. It's just that there's an important perspective on the matter that parents are not likely to get if they're getting most of their information from an ABA therapist or the diagnosing psychologist who recommended them to the ABA therapist. So people see it as somewhat of a duty to at least make sure that the parents are aware of these other issues.  There are some who are pretty vehement in their objections to it. And sometimes the conversation polarizes into people just talking past each other. But I think for the most part people just want to make sure that parents aren't making these decisions without being informed of the potential drawbacks."

autism,3cpdbv,JustMadeThisNameUp,2,Thu Jul 9 23:46:27 2015 UTC,"As others have said, 40 hours a week of therapy is the equivalent of a full time job for an adult. When you add to that all the other activities in a child's life (school being a big chunk of it) when does the child have time to just be a kid? To play? To do the things they enjoy? Also the forcing of eye contact is something I strongly disagree with, especially when the parent or therapist touches the child's face in order to get it done. It teaches the child that they must submit to any adult's authority and that their body is not their own. ASD kids are constantly taught about personal space but isn't other people touching their faces an invasion of their personal space? Autistic adults who have gone through ABA with the forced eye contact have written about resenting it. It's painful and uncomfortable. One last gripe with ABA is that is the child actually learning anything? When every act is followed by a reward, the child behaves just to get an award. It doesn't teach them go actually use their own problem solving skills to get things done."

Quote from the source:   When we got a provider agency and began our in-home ABA program, we were told ""Your child will cry."" When I asked why, I never got an answer. [...] At the second workshop my son cried. My husband was not there, but I sat in a state of disbelief and shock, with the student therapists we had hired, as I saw this ""consultant"" (who, by the way, was highly respected at her agency) essentially confuse, mystify, and scare my son. When my son rebelled and tried to escape, she cornered him - actually forcefully pushing/slamming him into the little chair in which he sat so well for our student therapists. She actually made the statement ""You have to be more merciless."" My son fell to the floor crying and as I jumped to get him, she said, ""No! Leave him there or you'll teach him its OK."" I thought ""It IS OK. He hasn't the slightest idea what you're doing or asking."" I told her, ""He doesn't UNDERSTAND."" She replied: ""It doesn't matter - he will!""   This is just one such example. If you do a simple google search you will find many more - I'd dig up more examples but this is very difficult for me to read about."

I do not subscribe to the theory of applied behavior analysis because this doesn't change the fact that autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder. There is no cure and any corrective treatment will only be superficial.   Although my social skills are much more developed than they were when I was ten, these skills (such as they are), are the result of a lifetime of experiences. I have a veritable mental catalog of do's and don'ts ... or to be more precise, a catalog of if-then conditional statements ... things to say and actions to take depending upon a given situation or spoken statement.   This does not change the fact that I am still socially awkward outside a work environment. I find large social groups to be unnerving because I have problems with focusing on one conversational stream. I am not good with remembering names and faces. I also tend to be quite blunt.  A friend once described me as being, ""refreshingly unfiltered"". This same woman who is no longer my friend did not appreciate it when I told her parents that she had a big dragon tattoo that ran the length of her back from just below her shoulders to just above her buttocks. She managed to stop me before I could explain the conditions under which I had seen her naked backside. I have subsequently modified my social paradigm to not include the sharing of what was evidently supposed to have been a close personal secret. I also understand that when someone asks, ""What's new?"" that is not sufficient reason to reveal the aforementioned closely held personal secrets.   Did I mention that I also have the tendency to ramble?   Getting back to the question at hand, I don't know how autistic your child is. My autism is quite mild as evidenced by the fact that I have three college degrees, have a decent well paying job, and have lived successfully on my own since earning my bachelor's degree. I also have very few friends and no significant other because I find working with people to be emotionally exhausting and when the weekend rolls around, I need downtime to recover. I turn off my phone, refuse to answer the front door, and eschew any social interactions that were not scheduled a week in advance.   As I understand it, ABA proponents say that this therapy can help teach ""normal"" behavior through applied behavioral modification ... but the reality is that your child's underlying neurological condition will always be the same.  I think it is far better for you to love and support your child and to help your child develop coping skills rather than inflicting a grueling 40 hours of therapy per week. Not only does 40 hours a week seem excessive but the child could also come to look upon this as a form of punishment."

We do specific teaching lessons for 15 minutes every 1 to 1 1/2 hours of play which includes reinforcing these kids for their hard work - correct answers or not.

We are currently at the end of our funding and are prepping for discharge in December. I truly feel that he would not be where he is today without this assistance. He requires 1 on 1 support and needs to be pushed in order to do/try things. Prior to IBI he would be content to just sit in a corner twirling a spoon all day and trying to engage him would result in a all out tantrum. As I type this he has a pretend farm that is being attacked by a lego chima mammoth and the rescue heroes are working on saving the animals. I could easily walk into the room and interrupt his play (and even participate). Now that being said, I do not think that he will be indistinguishable from neurotypicals (which is fine with me) as even at the end of therapy he has a lot of difficulty with communication and social.  Now my 5 year daughter did 6 hours of ABA/week for 1 year and this helped her get ready for school. Any more would have been detrimental to her as she can learn from a class environment and doesn't need the amount of 1 on 1 that my son requires. She continues to do 30 minutes of speech therapy every two weeks and requires guidance while in the classroom. She could pass off for neurotypical.

The most important thing is to make sure that there is follow through on the home front. If the parents aren't replicating the strategies at home it won't work as well.  We have noted a marked improvement in our daughter's ability to engage with the world at large.

autism,3ckohs,cakeisatruth,2,Wed Jul 8 23:41:01 2015 UTC,"Well, ""random"" persons happen to be friends of mine that just want to know more about the situations or what it's like growing up/living with/working with this type of thing.   It's not like I'm waiting for the bus or at a bar and whip out my phone to show off my little brother's worst moments.  It's easy to be critical of situations without experience.    Edit: It's also a tricky thing.  On one hand we want people to be respected and have their rights exercised and properly executed. On the other, we also want to shine a light on the difficulties of this type of disorder, making it more open and easily identifiable.  I don't think that it should be taken lightly, but so many people have so many different ideas of what autism is or ASD's are.  Having proof and making what you say a reality for others can be very beneficial in the understand of one's opinion on it.  People seem to have a lot of opinions about autism or what should be done about it without knowing hardly anything."
autism,3ckohs,Tired-Swine,7,Wed Jul 8 23:50:36 2015 UTC,"Just saying, I would be quite upset if my siblings showed videos of my worst moments to their friends. Autistic people are just as deserving of privacy as anyone else.  The issue with using it to show how ""difficult"" autism is, is that a video only shows the external behavior. It would have been easy to take a video of me at age 16, banging my head on the floor and screaming that I couldn't find my calculator (for example). What that video wouldn't show is everything that had led up to it: how I'd been bullied at school as usual, then had an emotionally exhausting therapy session where I brought up memories of a past sexual assault, and my sister had been playing music very loudly all evening (part of my personal sensory hell) despite my asking her to turn it down because I was trying to study, and I had a math test the next day where I'd likely fail the class if I didn't get a good grade, so it was already pretty late by the time I realized I couldn't find the calculator I needed to have for that test - hence the behavior. But from a video of that, all someone would be able to see was that I was unreasonably upset about a calculator.  Yes, the behavior was still negative. But there was a lot more to it than what a video would show."
autism,3ckohs,cakeisatruth,0,Thu Jul 9 00:06:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not showing it and not explaining any kind of escalation.  I only know that for documentation reasons, and as well as my own psyche, as people often times do not believe me when I explain what happens at my job, what he goes through or what the job entails, etc.   My brother is extremely low functioning.  He's never going to have a girlfriend or boyfriend, work a job, go to school, live on his own. None of that. He's quite violent and has a long history of destructive behavior. Nearly non-verbal, you have to decipher what he says by figuring out what part of what movie he's reciting that could indicate what exactly it is he wants. What seems to non-autistic people as random gibberish, I'm sure there's a good amount of meaning behind it.  I'm not trying to dismiss your opinion on it.  It's just a very difficult task to tackle when attempting to discuss it or educate people on what it's like by only hearsay.   Autistic people are just that. People. They're just developmentally disabled. I'm not saying that it's okay to dismiss their right to privacy.  In my brother's case, it's so severe that I sort of look at it in the same way that a scientist may conduct a series of studies by recording a severe schizophrenic and the individual's tendencies in order to help himself, colleagues, and eventually the general public understand and accept the disorder better."
autism,3ckohs,Tired-Swine,3,Thu Jul 9 00:21:25 2015 UTC,I think we'll have to agree to disagree. I hope your brother is someday capable of doing the things you don't believe he'll do.

autism,3cmz46,confused123456,5,Thu Jul 9 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like Aspergers perhaps?  Things to watch out for, from another ""aspie"":   lack of interest in socializing and making friends. It's not a matter of not wanting friends; it's just sometimes you'd rather be alone. It's just a mood and not something to really worry about. However, do encourage (but not push!) them to make friends and be social. They won't always want to, but make sure they have the opportunity, and teach them that making friends (with real people) is a good thing. They'll probably have difficulty learning social skills that come naturally to most people; it's important that they have lots of opportunity to develop those skills and that they don't feel bad for being ""weird"". You'll want to mention to the parents and teachers of the other kids that he's autistic and explain a little about what that means. He can learn social skills, it will just be more difficult than for most people and will take a conscious effort to remember them at first. Autism is often paired with mental disability such as Tourettes and difficulty learning, but high-functioning autism/Aspergers usually aren't. Chances are, your child will be quite bright, but may not appear that way at first. They'll be great at logic and sequences (math, spelling, puzzles) but not as good at things that involve ""illogical"" things like emotion, socializing, art etc. They may do poorly in school, not because they struggle with the material but because they're bored. School is pretty fucking boring and they'd probably rather just doodle, work on something else, or even just stare at the wall - they'll find fascination in things that seem mundane to you, like the pattern on the wall or the number of tiles on the ceiling. They might get in trouble for ""misbehaving"" or not paying attention, because they just aren't interested in the class and would rather play/chat with the other kids (and may not see much problem with doing so during class). Don't take the teacher's or even principal's word as law - there are a lot of crappy teachers out there. My mother had a hell of a time convincing any school staff to actually read my file (which they made!) that would have explained everything to them. They might appear to have ADD or ADHD, but they probably don't. They will have a bit of an obsessive tendency and short attention span in childhood. They'll probably pick one or two subjects and become obsessed with them for a few years. They'll grow out of it eventually though. Remember, they aren't stupid and can understand you just fine. Make sure other adults they might talk to know this. However they will have trouble reading your body language. Make sure you actually state what you mean to say. Don't be offended if they just give a short reply like ""ok"" and don't engage you; they don't mean to be rude, they're just responding while still focused on whatever they're doing. They'll be almost like a Vulcan, taking things literally, viewing everything as a logic problem and being confused if you get upset about it. ""Why would I turn my head and look you in the eye? We can hear eachother just fine and if I look away I won't be able to keep drawing."" Get him an old computer; the kind that you program yourself."
autism,3cmz46,RenaKunisaki,2,Thu Jul 9 17:32:10 2015 UTC,Thank you! He does sound like what was formerly known as Aspergers except he does not have pedantic speech. He did not speak until 2 and he does have grammatical errors now that he does.

autism,3cmz46,cakeisatruth,2,Fri Jul 10 01:18:08 2015 UTC,"That's great that he has a diagnosis! It can open a lot of doors.  ABA is far from your only option, and as the links /u/JAWJAWBINX added show, it's not always a good thing. Communication issues sometimes improve or resolve completely on their own with time and peer interaction, but different types of therapies can help a lot.  Because your son is already three, he'll receive services through the school system regardless of whether or not he's in preschool. You may want to contact them about social skills groups. It might be a small group of children with a therapist guiding them through the steps to a successful conversation. (E.g.: ""Andrew, what did you do this weekend?"" ""I went to the movies."" ""That's a great conversation starter. What could you ask so that other people can join in?"") Or it might be a one-on-one session with just him and a therapist walking him through some scenarios. It really depends on what is best for him.  The bit about him ""only caring for older children"" made me smile - I was definitely the same way as a child, and still kind of am. (I'm 18 and most of my friends are in their early to late 20s.) I was always told it indicated a type of maturity, if that makes you feel any better about it. :P"
autism,3cmz46,cakeisatruth,3,Thu Jul 9 19:47:22 2015 UTC,Do you know what other therapies there are? He was tested by our school district and because he is not considered delayed enough they did not offer services. I can try again but they said they would put him in a special ED class. I really feel it would be a disservice to him since it's 30 kids who are more delayed thus he would be on the backburner and not get the help he needs. The social class is exactly what he needs. He is in a preschool and we are thinking about sending him to an inclusive preschool with children on the spectrum as well as children who are not but it is very expensive. I'm trying to read up on how to help him gently.   I DO NOT want him to appear neurotypical nor am I trying to cure him. He is fucking perfect. I just want him to have some skills to help him do well in school
autism,3cmz46,JAWJAWBINX,2,Thu Jul 9 22:56:34 2015 UTC,"I see someone else already mentioned floortime to you, which is what I would have recommended. I've heard nothing but good things about it - it's play-based and child-led.  If Montessori is an option, that might be worth looking into as an alternative to the inclusive preschool. They tend to have classes as a mix of kids aged 3-6 with the general basis that they learn from each other (at least, to the best of my understanding). There will definitely be more options in the next few years as he moves up to elementary school and there's a bit more freedom.  Your last paragraph is the most important...it's far more damaging for a child to grow up thinking they need to be ""fixed"" or ""cured"" than it is for them to have to learn coping skills."

autism,3cmz46,mizredds,2,Thu Jul 9 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you. We had an OT(only had feeding issues) who was abusive and used those methods. I fired her. It is abuse.  What about floortime? I do NOT wish to make him less autistic. Honestly he reminds me of my husband in a lot of ways. He is perfect. He just needs help in two areas as far as I am concerned so he can do well in school. IDGAF if he is ""weird"" or has few friends who are older etc etc. Hell I am NT and my love of science made me ""weird"" in JR high.  What I DO want is for him to be able to have a conversation and answer questions he himself doesn't direct. He is mute when you try to ask him something or direct a conversation. He is in speech as he didn't talk until two but it isn't helping him apply the skills. He will direct conversations and repeat things he memorized.  I also want tools to help him be able to do a task and come back to something he is hyperfocused on like a toy etc. It hinders everything else.  My son is very, very bright. I do not want him in special Ed. I will die before I place him there because I honestly feel he is as fast if not faster than his peers. I do not give a shit if his friends are older, if he only has one friend or if he does his little dance. I talk with my hands. I do think he needs help somehow to improve those to areas though so he can do well in school and I have no idea how to help him.  My insurance covers only ABA and ST. I like floortime more and am wondering if I can find an ABA therapist willing to do that or bill it like that? Is there any issue with floortime? Any therapy to help him cope so he can do well in school?"
autism,3cmz46,mizredds,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:51:41 2015 UTC,"I looked at the studies and read reviews of parents and ABA is conducted so widely by therapists, that there are very, very good forms and very, very bad forms. I highly, highly recommend very, very good ABA and am fighting to get it covered by the insurance companies in mystate. Those posters are anti aba because it used to be very abusive and still is in many cases, but ABA can be an extremely effective form of therapy that your child loves. My child loves his very, very good ABA therapists and sees them as his friends.   On the other hand, we had an OT and a ST who were abusive. When it comes to ABA, the therapists are abusive, not the therapy itself."
autism,3cmz46,mizredds,2,Thu Jul 9 23:24:33 2015 UTC,Yes. ABA does work; or at least it works for my child. Also trying to get coverage....so tough right now.
autism,3cmz46,JAWJAWBINX,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"If your insurance covers ABA, you should check it out. You can try different therapists until you find the one that works well with your child. The therapist will help to bridge that connection between home and school.   Academics are great, but social skills are important too. Right now my daughter is considered high functioning, and I have her enrolled in social skills classes to help her learn social skills. I think its really helping. She also takes additional speech (thru my insurance, in addition to speech provided at school).   What does the evaluation say in regards to the school setting?  That class size does seem large. However, general ed classes tend to be large.   I want to add this. Dont necessarily think of special ed as a bad thing. Its very different from special ed from the past. You have to consider what works best for tour child. Its not about you, its about them in their least restrictive environment.   Because of his speech delays, it does seem like a special ed or co taught environment might be better . But it doesn't mean it will be forever....just take it one day at a time.   Good luck to you"

You're helping him get services he can benefit greatly from, which will help him have the most productive and independent life possible. You're preserving your relationship as brothers rather than taking on the role of parent. You're doing what is best for you, while ensuring he is in good, trained, professional hands.   Of course not everyone's experience with residential programs is good, but always advocate for him and never be afraid to speak up just because ""they're the professionals.""

The individuals who stay there vary in dependencies and illnesses, but it's assisted living.  If my brother,  who is quite independent but still needs guidance, had to stay in one,  I wouldn't be bothered about it as long as he had a television and his games.    As much as you love your sibling, and want to see them at their best, you as an individual must also do what you can to have your side of things happy too, with your significant other and such.

autism,3cjhx7,ceberous,0,Wed Jul 8 18:31:08 2015 UTC,I would suggest sitting down and calling a couple of them. Or even your local mental institution. The mental institution would have a lot of information and probably a recommendation on which facilities to try first. And then just go by yourself and walk around and talk to staff and have a look around. Idk why this is getting down voted. I am not saying lock him up and throw away the key. I am saying use them as a resource for facilities that are for adult special needs groups. There is google sure but google doesn't have inside information that I have gotten from my children's therapists. They are both autistic. We have some kind of therapy going on everyday but I am just not at that point if they will need adult care or not they are still young. Institutions are an over looked resource. One of my kids was diagnosed through the mental health side because some insurance companies will pay for things through mental health and do not classify ASD as a medical issue.
autism,3cjhx7,ceberous,3,Wed Jul 8 15:12:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. There is so much to consider. Has he ever lived outside the home (I'm thinking a curriculum- and/or therapy-based facility for children with special needs)? Does he use any alternative modes of communication? I can't speak to your situation, but can offer a little general advice as a caregiver of adults with disabilities in their home.   What kind of services your brother will qualify for will be based on an assessment either by the agency providing the care or a physician/therapist. There are hundreds of questions that measure their needs such as...can they hold a spoon? Can they recognize if someone is a stranger? Can they cross streets safely? Can they differentiate colors? Can they use the restroom independently? Can they identify what their medications are for? Do they have aggressive tendencies? Can they stand up from a sitting position without assistance?  Once he has a ""rating"" so to speak, that will determine what kind of funding the state will give the agency of yours and his choosing to offer services. This determines how long he can be left alone, what kind of staff-to-client ratio he can function well in, and a million other things. If your mother is his official guardian, you guys need to get the transfer of guardianship figured out before she goes. You can be co-guardian to make it as seamless as possible. I don't even know where else to go with this....it's too much for one post! Please message me if you'd like more guidance, or update. Start a dialogue with your local residential CSP (agency providing services to the special needs population), and they will be able to guide you every step of the way."
autism,3cjhx7,cakeisatruth,2,Wed Jul 8 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"I am going through this with my son who is younger and probably a little more severe as he lacks language. You need to go to your state agencies and find out what programs are available for him.   Does someone have guardianship of him ? Is he currently receiving any services from the state ?  Does he have a program manager/coordinator from the state ? Does he receive social security and medicare/medicaid ?  It's complicated but there are many ways to approach it. A lawyer (if you can afford one) could help but is not necessary. You could make him a ward of the state which will then decide the appropriate placement for him at state expense or you could become his guardian retaining some measure of control about where he ends up (the state will still pay for it). The key is to plan now- and get things in motion, it takes a long time if you want to get him in the right place (which you should want to do), if you wait he could end up in an institution or worse. Good luck all the best."
autism,3cjhx7,nelleker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"I always hear in the trainings for school-aged people that the parents need to start planning as early as 12 years old, and by that they're usually referring to finding the skills and interests that could perhaps lead to vocational opportunities so they can start the practicing. It's so true! It also applies to starting the conversations of whether they need a guardian, whether they'll need a payee, who is going to do those things (and who are the backups lest anything happen to them), what kind of living setup would work best, and so on."

There are a lot of reasons why someone might have bathroom accidents, often for medical reasons - sometimes from past injury, sometimes from birth defects, and there are some people who just don't feel the urge to go until it's too late. I think any 15-year-old would be mortified if you were to bring this up out of nowhere, especially as he may physically be unable to stop doing it.  However, I looked at your post history and noticed you'd asked for advice on dealing with this issue yourself. If that's what you really mean, have you tried making a schedule? It might help to set alarms on your watch or phone to remind yourself to go. Right after waking up, right before going to bed, and 20 minutes after drinking anything are probably the most important. If you're still having this problem, you could add more reminder times based on how often you need it. Within a week, you should probably be able to judge whether or not this is working."

Glad you're so willing and ready to help. :) A lot of this depends on the age range of the kids - can you give us a ballpark figure of how old they are and how many of them you're looking after?   I'm assuming these kids are fairly young...do you have space for them to run around? Duck Duck Goose, tag (flashlight tag is fun after dark), Doggie Doggie Where's Your Bone, Red Light Green Light, charades, musical chairs, board games, or adapt team sports to fit their abilities (like a version of ""soccer"" where nobody plays any set position, for example). ""Okay, if you don't want to play, you can do [activity nearby] instead."" Maybe doing a puzzle or drawing a picture. No reason to fight about it. Either play shorter games, or something where each child gets a turn - like charades, with everyone getting a chance to act something out, etc. Maybe teach about ""inside voices"" if they don't already know it? I think this is a universal kid thing, autism/Down's or not. Not completely sure how to handle it, sorry. ""No, don't hit [name], that hurts. If you need to hit, you can hit [a pillow/stuffed toy/etc], but not a person."" I think that would depend on what they did. If they broke a toy, for example, after they calm down you could show it to them and explain that nobody can play with it now. You'll probably get a lot of different opinions here. It really depends on what works for this group. What does the staff do now and how well does it work? Can you give us more information on what you're looking for?

(Like simple indoor games)  2- that seems like the appropriate thing to do.  3- We tried charades but they don't understand it, and even if they do they won't listen or like it. (sitting, guessing and talking isn't their thing)  4- Like tell them instead of screaming, scream inside your head?  5- That sounds really good, can't believe it never crossed my mind.  6- we do that, but it doesn't teach them anything. Is time-outs and 'Go stand next to the wall for three minutes' usable for them?  7- they don't punish, just say that what they did was bad and the kid just runs around screaming, without grasping that it was wrong.  8- indoor toys that are educational or at least makes them have a fun time.

autism,3cknzm,cakeisatruth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"1 - A beanbag toss would be similar to what you described. Or a game like Pictionary, where one person draws something and the others try and guess what it is as quickly as possible. If you have some balloons, those are pretty much universally fun (you could play ""don't let the balloon touch the ground"" or balloon volleyball, to name two). Maybe a treasure hunt if you can set one up. Shoe relay if everyone can manage with their shoes independently.  3 - It doesn't have to be charades, you could also do it with Duck Duck Goose (with the rule that everyone must be picked once), or tag where everyone gets a chance to be ""it,"" etc. Something that will keep them engaged.  4 - If it's frustrated screaming, you could offer screaming into a pillow. If it's happy screaming and being loud, I'm not really sure about that, sorry.  6 & 7 - Time-out works for some kids...I've also seen the suggestion of having the child draw a picture of what they did wrong (or what they can do better next time).  8 - Lego (or Duplo for younger kids), Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs, pattern blocks...all educational in their own way and definitely fun for kids of different ages."
autism,3cknzm,SWaspMale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:55:32 2015 UTC,"Should there be a punishing system. If so. What are you suggesting.   My general understanding of reward and punishment (operant conditioning) is that punishment can work if the punishment can be delivered within 1-2 seconds of the undesired behavior.  Rewards may be the same.  Since it may be hard to keep up this kind of rapid feedback, consistently for a long period of time, punishment often ends up as simple cruelty :("
autism,3ckiyj,Isadoraisacat,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily advice, but encouragement, it can work. I was first diagnosed with ADD at age 40 and ASD at 60. Met a young lady at 20 who found me interesting enough to hang around with. She always found me a bit ""weird"" but she stayed with me.  Always had problems with me being distant and emotionally unresponsive, but I could always tell her ""I love you"", and mean it, even though I don't feel it.  Still married after 35 years, and have 3 successful adult children off on their own. Yes it can work with the right partner. Sometimes you have to fake it, sometimes they know.  Telling her what you need to, even if the words seem hollow to you, is important.  The one thing I can be is bluntly honest and analytical, often not a good thing for a relationship, caused real problems at first but she learned to listen and I learned when to just shut up.  And, sorry, I do tend to ramble on a bit."
autism,3ckiyj,3885Khz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"You'll need to ask your General Practitioner Doctor to refer you to a psychologist specializing and adult diagnosis of aspergers or high functioning spectrum of autism. ( it's spelt aspergers, but don't worry lots of people make that spelling mistake ). Even so, i think most psychologists would know what to look out for. please seek help with a doctor..... in your case it might not even be Aspergers, you could have several other diagnosis that may make it look like you have Aspergers. A combination of Social anxiety, depression, OCD, ADD, ADHD, bipolar can all be easily confused for autism or aspergers. it's a particularly difficult diagnosis and can take months or even years to finalize, but you being an adult makes it much more easier to have access to facilities that can help you."
autism,3ckiyj,YANN_LIFE,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"I often see people recommend going to a GP for a reference first. But in my experience that's not the best resource. Medical GPs are rarely qualified to diagnose or even recognize autism, even more so for adults on the high functioning end who've developed working coping mechanism to pass, even more so for individuals diagnosed with similar disorders, such as ADHD, that could be confused with autism.  There are many stories of people being written off, and not even given a referral, by GPs simply because the GP is not qualified.  The situation is improved somewhat if you see a psychologist, but even a non-specializing psychologist is often not qualified to assess a high functioning adult with good coping mechanisms (for example).  IMO, the best course of action is to look up your city or state's autism society. They will likely have a list of mental health professionals qualified to give autism assessments. Call around and ask which ones assess adults (many will only assess children), and book an appointment. It's rare that you will need a referral from another psychologist or physician."
autism,3ckiyj,cpt_anonymous,3,Thu Jul 9 16:34:44 2015 UTC,Very true. I would also add: make every effort to go through your health insurance if you have some. Assessments can be anywhere from a couple hundred to a couple thousand dollars if paid out of pocket.

However, given the fact that we still have no idea how to handle autism - ABA at best hides the symptoms - we planned the platform to work with pretty much any kind of therapy that requires data to be taken and graphed. However, marketing such an app would've been at best difficult.   As I've said elsewhere, we're doing this for and with Autistic people, not ""to"" them. That's why the crowdfund is set to all or naught - a huge chunk of what we want to build is a community. If we can't pull that off, we could just as well give up.

autism,3cht4v,Gwendalenia,16,Wed Jul 8 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"She's not ignoring you when she doesn't answer to her name - she really doesn't hear you. She doesn't see you standing next to her. All she knows is that you're suddenly interrupting what she's working on and sudden interruptions are going to be bad news for kids on the spectrum. Have you tried tapping her on the shoulder? I don't think this is just being stubborn or just being a 5 year old - she likely has sensory processing problems and doesn't even realize you're trying to get her attention and most people with ASD have a hard time changing activities without adequate notice - of which you've accidentally given her absolutely none.    I would also be very careful of your overreaction as well as what you do to follow up.  You don't have to accept is as fine but physically hurting her or intimidating her is not going to help either. Remind yourself of this as you approach situations like this - you should be able to see a pattern and at least somewhat predict when she's going to spit, pinch etc and you need to make a conscious choice of what you're going to do in these situations next time. Practice role playing with someone else, walk through it in your head a few times whatever you have to do to make sure that your reaction is appropriate and helpful for the situation when the time comes. It's definitely hard to fight the instinct to shout but with work it can be done.   But what I'd also make sure you do is if you are angry, don't let go and leave the room. What unfortunately you're teaching your daughter with this is action is that if she cries, you'll leave her alone - which will only encourage not only the crying but the initial reaction as well because while you wanted her to stop playing with her LeapPad and get changed, what ended up happening is that she didn't have to change and she got to continue to play with the LeapPad - so a total win for her! Obviously you're not intentionally trying to teach her this, but unintentionally you're absolutely reinforcing all of these behaviors.   What it very hard to do, but needs to be done is you need to ignore the behaviors. If she bites you, you calmly repeat your request to her, paying the biting no attention. If there is risk of serious harm you do the minimum necessary to neutralize that risk and continue on the same path that you were on. If she's got a death grip with her teeth on your arm and about to draw blood then calmly remove her from your arm and repeat your original request. You can also tell her not to bite, but really it's important not to make a big thing out of the biting at the moment it's occurring as you don't want to get distracted from the original task."
autism,3cht4v,malica77,8,Wed Jul 8 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"There's already been some great tips posted here, but I wanted to add: have you tried giving her more transition time? It might help if you're getting her attention first (either by tapping her on the shoulder or interrupting her line of sight with a hand/paper/etc) and giving her a warning. Obviously that isn't always possible, but it's not going to hurt anything if she sits in a ripped dress for 2 or 5 more minutes.  If you haven't already tried a timer, that might help too. Some devices have it built in - I'm not sure about leappad, but it's worth a shot. It could very well be that when you turned off the book, she thought she was being punished or something similar, rather than you just wanting her attention."
autism,3cht4v,cakeisatruth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:36:10 2015 UTC,I should know better than to end something with her without a timer or count down.  I have used a timer before and she likes them. But then she gets obsessed with how much longer she has
autism,3cht4v,KikiTheArtTeacher,2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe first/then visuals? If the timer becomes an obsession? So, a little visual that shows 'change clothes' (with a corresponding picture) as 'first' and 'leap pad' as 'then.' It might help as she would know that she could go back to the Leap Pad once she changed, and the visual would reinforce this?"
autism,3cht4v,HarryPFlashman,5,Sat Jul 11 09:20:32 2015 UTC,"I have a severely autistic son who doesn't speak but will attack me at times, when frustrated.  It is very difficult keeping your cool, I can empathize and completely understand. What has worked for me is a few things: (I hope it helps, its from 16 years of experience)  1: realize your daughter is different, she will never be ""normal"". The quicker you accept this, the better for her and you.  2: understand that you have to connect with her differently than you were raised or even what makes sense to you. The lashing out is almost certainly directly related to her Autism.  3: find rewards to give incentives for good behavior. For instance is you want her to change her dress. Try to do that before she gets the leap pad (the incentive) and let her know that after she does these things she gets to do what she wants. If you need to interrupt it, you should not do it abruptly. My son will seem like he isn't listening but he is. I repeat myself several times. (EG Ralph its time to get changed for bed then you can go back to reading ..repeat it over and over) then when its time to stop the activity, repeat it agin but take the incentive away slowly, while explaining what you are doing and letting her know she can have it back after she does (insert activity here). You will probably see the quickest moving kid ever, because autistics are very motivated when....very motivated.  I cant guarantee this will work,  but what i can absolutely tell you is....this will get worse, she will get bigger and stronger and you will not be able to control her., unless you get it under control now. I have lived it, its very hard.   To summarize:  Find what motivates your daughter. For my son its Candy, Cologne, baths, swimming and car rides.   Use that as the carrot to get your daughter to the things she doesn't want to do, but has to.   Use positive reinforcement and try not to say the words ""no""- just redirect to what you want and use the reinforcer/incentive.  I hope this helps in some way. Please feel free to let me know if I can assist any more. Good luck."

Here's the best advice you'll ever get. Give up your child. Adoption, foster home, family member, etc.  No offense, not trying to be harsh. But as a parent with a special needs child, you need to have a tolerance for lots of things and they may include being yelled at, hit, spit, pushed, pinched, or even physical abuse. Of course the goal is to reduce and eliminate this behaviors, but if you can honestly say that you can't deal with it, please for your childs sake, find someone who can."

autism,3cht4v,nadeshdara,2,Wed Jul 8 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"Does she know what a timer does/means?  If she responds well to the ding of a timer then you may have something to work with.  You could implement this by either structuring her leisure time or just using it as, say, a five minute warning before she has to stop what she's doing for the next activity (even if that means she gets to go right back to her toy afterward).   Does she understand what pictures are? Picture schedules might be another option.  HarryPFlashman was spot on with figuring out rewards and incentives for good/appropriate behavior. Making the experience a positive one (even small ones like you asking her for a favor or to change her dress), and being consistent with the good times, is crucial to more appropriate behavior/responding down the road."
autism,3cht4v,mizredds,4,Wed Jul 8 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"There are so many unkind words in my head, it's making the typing of this post difficult. Please excuse my English. (The unkind words are probably wrong. You sound exhausted, I hope you have someone you can lean on.)  Three things: Managing anger, method of disruption, occasion of disruption.  Managing anger: Anger is hard. Anger when we feel hurt and tired is harder. Nobody understands that better than us.  Suggestions: Yoga, body scan, guided, autogenic training, progressive relaxation. Short term: Breathing & counting techniques are good. Long term: Expect realistic outcomes, reduces incidence of anger and need for management.  Expectation is that anger management is learned automatically, but that expectation is unrealistic. No shame in learning it now so you can teach your daughter later. Learning together might be fun? Not all techniques work for everyone. Maybe you will have the same, maybe different ones. For her, also try stimming.  Method: You assume ""ignoring me"". She knows you're calling? She knows you want her attention? Unlikely. Think ""not noticing me,"" makes less angry and probably closer to the truth. Learn good path of escalation.  Example in your scenario: clear voice -> close physical presence -> device off -> BOOM.  Better example: clear voice name -> clear voice explanation you want her attention -> walk around into peripheral vision -> disrupt eye contact with object of attention temporarily (with a hand/paper/etc) -> physically restrain interaction with activity (announce first) -> turn off device -> BOOM. Previous steps used during further steps. Reaffirm she is not paying attention to you between steps. Maybe no eye contact/body language even when attention is rendered. If this is hard to understand, can ask my roomie to tape me next time she gets my attention while I'm engrossed, am not too embarrassed about being on the internet. Usually disrupting eye contact is sufficient. Easier to bear if I know it's temporary.  Best example: Ask her what works. I knew very young how I liked to be disrupted. Feeling power over the process made it hurt less when it happened. Still prefer to decide myself. If she does not know, suggest alternatives and let her pick.  When attention is established, make your demand. If she does not want to, that's a separate issue. Maybe strong preference for that dress? Discuss why not, establish whose interest is more important in given situation.  Disruptions: Help your daughter see you as the good guy. Explain harm that comes from her being engrossed (e.g. you can't do the laundry before she is in her jammies so you can fix dress/have it ready when she wants to play again). If you need help with the rationale behind particular parental interruptions, send a PM (therapist said not conscious knowledge for NT people, not trying to be a condescending dick). Will reply, probably in more coherent English."

Trying to teach the attitude of questioning and retesting what you see in a safe way could help him come to his own conclusions that although the ad has some basis in science it's an oversimplification/distorting the truth because the magnets needed to support the weight of a person (not to mention a person falling at great speed) would be enormous and nothing like the magnets shown.   Other than that, you can just go with the ""not everything you see on TV is true"" - which is usually easier to understand for the TV shows themselves but it also goes for the ads themselves too."

What I'd do is take things to the root of the problem - metaphors themselves. I'd read him poetry and ask him what he thinks of this and that metaphor, explaining what they actually mean - what meaning has been given to them.  With enough exposure, he should probably start to understand the pattern. Make it into a game of knowledge.  I'm not a professional, so my advice might be bull&*)%.

My son is autistic and after many meetings I've self diagnosed myself on the spectrum (not an official diagnosis by any means).    My wife and my biggest concern right now is that our son is able to verbalize his frustrations.  He's 5 right now with twin baby brothers at home.  The twins are 1 year old and very loud.  He loves his brothers but can't tolerate the noise they make.  We've tried a lot of things to help settle and calm him, bought him noise cancelling headphones among other things.  Anyways, your posts have made me smile, giving me hope that I'll have a regular conversation with him one day.   He communicates much like you did at his age.  Thank you."

It sounds like you've got some great solutions implemented to deal with his frustrations. If you have an Autism Spectrum Disorder, that's good for when you're parenting a kid with autism. I would highly encourage you to frequently be tapping into what I like to call one's autism intuition or in other words your knowledge and wisdom about what autism is like and what solutions would be feasible for helping people with autism with their certain characteristics that comes out of the fact that you have autism. I like to use my autism intuition when I have opportunities to educate people about autism or when I'm wanting to think up solutions to deal with certain characteristics of autism. That way, people don't get tempted to abuse the kid when the kid isn't performing the desired behavior because there are plenty of solutions to try out. When I'm talking about this autism intuition thing, I'm not trying to brag; I am thinking the words I am typing in an excited tone of voice in my mind. Keep up the good work! Oh and if you haven't already, you might want to check Dr. Jed Baker's, Temple Grandin's, and possibly Tony Attwood's books, videos, and other materials. Dr. Jed Baker and Tony Attwood are neurotypicals. Dr. Jed Baker is a behavioral consultant for people with autism and Asperger's Syndrome. I seem to recall seeing in a university library a video by Dr. Tony Attwood on Frustration, Anxiety, and Anger, so you might want to look for that at your local library. On Amazon, I couldn't find a video specifically on Frustration."

Maybe whatever ones don't make the cut for being the title for the whole book will be a chapter title or the title of an autism newsletter if I start up an autism newsletter.   I am basically planning on writing in the book pretty much everything I have said in my autism speeches and anything else I can think of to say about autism that would be helpful. I would be writing about stuff from my life with autism and various solutions for working on overcoming or lessening certain weaknesses or characteristics that aren't as desirable. I have some I've already thought up that I would love to try out! I would probably also talk about what characteristics need to be worked on and which you don't need to. I would give various other insights and explanations of autism. Whenever I give an autism speech, I usually tailor it to each audience, so in the book, I might have some chapters designated only for certain group(s) of people. I don't know how to write a book, but I might approach it like an essay only it would be a lot longer; I could make my chapter titles, make an intro sentence and/or paragraph for each chapter, write several body paragraphs, and then write at least a few sentences to wrap up the loose ends of the chapter.   It's going to be at least a few years, possibly a lot more until I am out my current extremely busy stage of life and can maybe start writing the book. This is all talk and planning years in advance though, so a lot of this could be subject to change."

autism,3c9pku,randired,22,Mon Jul 6 04:55:53 2015 UTC,"Tell him now. He needs to know, and chances are if he's around kids his age for any length of time he's already aware he is different. Every single autistic person I've communicated with (myself included) has said that it's a huge relief to get the diagnosis because it explains so much - that there's something causing this, lots of other people have it, and it isn't our fault or anything we're doing wrong.  I would really recommend you don't use terms like ""high-functioning"" when you do this. I was a little older than him when I was first diagnosed, and my parents were focused on drilling it into my head that I was ""extremely high-functioning, only mildly autistic,"" etc. Then in my teenage years I regressed to the point where I was having very frequent meltdowns, head-banging/biting/hitting myself, and struggling a lot with everyday tasks. I had never been introduced to the idea that functioning is not static, and it absolutely obliterated my self-esteem.  Of course, I'm not saying your son will go through the same things, but there's no need to give him this kind of functioning label. It doesn't really benefit him or you to do so. Here's a good explanation you might want to share with him.  There are some really good books for explaining the spectrum. I recommend this one, or this other one. The first one in particular really touches on all the different types of autism that exist."
autism,3c9pku,cakeisatruth,7,Mon Jul 6 05:53:46 2015 UTC,"If it is of any help, my parents told me when I was about the same age as your son is now. I had the exact same feeling as others here described: relief. I have never had the feeling that anything changed for me as a person from that moment on. The only difference was that I knew more about who this person was.  In any case, I would say you have to keep it to you and your son. He is your son, you know him, and the fact that you are thinking about this tells me you love him. This isn't about the psychological phenomenon autism; this is about him and you and your family. He just happens to be a person who fits the description that was laid out by psychologists to describe certain persons. So it's not a thing called autism affecting him. He is someone who fits the description autism. So I would say you only need to tell about autism insofar as it relates to him. Of course you should also tell him that there are other traits which fall under the umbrella of autism. These might apply to him as well, but they might just as well have nothing to do with him. That way he won't start doubting himself when he learns more about autism. I think what /u/cakeisatruth says about the functioning distinction relates to this. You don't have to give a lecture on autism. You are not a psychologist (as far as I know, at least) and that is not your job. You only need to help your son figure out who he is.  To put it crudely, the diagnosis is there for people who do not know him and quickly have to learn about him. You are his mother; you don't need the diagnosis to know him. You have seen him more and in more situations than any psychologist. Your son is approaching an age where he will wonder who he is as a person. And psychologists and psychiatrists happen to have compiled a wealth of information on people who are a lot like your son. This can be a tool for your son, for you and for your family to help him figure out who he is. I think this relates to what /u/nadeshdara has said. But in the end, the people who know him best can decide what applies to him and what doesn't.  Perhaps what I have said does not apply to you and your family. In any case, all of this might very well be too much to talk about at one given moment. Perhaps it will be entirely inappropriate at that specific time to tell him how you are not letting his diagnosis guide you, or something like that. That might get sentimental, or whatever. The main thing here is that this is an attitude that has kept me viewing myself as a person in my own right, and not as an instance of autism. My only hope is that it can be of help to you. So I would say again that this is about him, you and your family. Tell him there is information that he can ask about and look up when he feels it might be useful to him. He will probably want to find out more himself. But don't force him to learn about it either. That information isn't going anywhere. This is not about autism. This is about him."
autism,3c9pku,Sochamelet,7,Mon Jul 6 09:50:43 2015 UTC,"You should, in general, not withhold a diagnosis made about their personal health from a person. Sometimes you'll have to use kid-size words to convey what that diagnosis means, but at 11 years of age your son is well old enough to just hear ""autistic"". Trust me, we notice that we're different, we just don't always have a name for it. The extra information can only help us direct our efforts.  Maybe you can read up on it together, since it seems like you're not super well informed about it yet either. That could be a fun family activity.  PS: As a verbal/functioning/debilliated person, I haven't got a single nice word for the whole high/low functioning bogus."

autism,3c9pku,McLeod3013,3,Mon Jul 6 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"This may not be much help and only anecdotal to us. Our 3rd child, of 4 was diagnosed with PPD/NOS. At his grade six graduation he won the award for the ""Most Artistic"" which floored his siblings that are actually into the arts (they take after me the artist rather than dad the engineer)... Son was rather surprised to get the award too.... So happy joking I asked him if perhaps they messed up and he should have been given the award for ""The Most Autistic"" ... he sheeshed me and told me... ""Mom I got better!"" and we all laughed.  An autism diagnosis, isn't something written in stone. By grade six (appx 11 years old) the person should have an idea that they are different, but should be respected for that. But if your son is wondering what it means, you will have to fill in those words. Tell him how you love how he takes a deep interest and makes it so kewl when other people don't see the world as he does. It is confusing, so encourage him to ask lots of questions. You have the internet at your fingertips, discover the answers together, you will be surprised where he takes you.

autism,3c9pku,jugdealer,2,Tue Jul 7 08:24:24 2015 UTC,"We try to focus on EVERYONES good points   How do we improve if we ignore the bad?  IMO he should know why he must take the pills.  'Autistic' only means he has some of the 'Autism Spectrum Disorder' symptoms.  I think lots of people do, many of them undiagnosed.  Yes, lots of things can be debilitating if they happen in teh extreme, but I think ignoring the possibilities completely is only going to increase his anxiety."
autism,3c9pku,SWaspMale,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that because every child is different, and even every autistic child is different, no one else can know for certain exactly when is the ideal time to tell your child something like this.  I agree that it is an important framework for your child to have, but at the same time, as parents we have to balance that against where our children are emotionally, and figure out what they are able to hear and handle right now.  Someone else I read somewhere talked about ""dribbling"" the information out, and I like that, because that's kind of what I've been doing.  I have been cautious when I talk to my son about it.  He is 8 years old.  We are in a similar situation because he has a twin brother who is not on the autism spectrum (or at least, he wasn't when the dx happened at 2), although his brother is pretty obviously ADHD (like both of their parents).  However, our situation is also different because we chose to homeschool, and therefore our children are not continuously confronted with dramatic reveals of their differences from other children.   This has made it easier for me to be relaxed and gradual about dribbling out this information.  I can really appreciate that it you probably don't have the same luxury.  One thing I did early on, by which I mean a couple of years ago, was to just introduce the term.  He reacted violently against it without even knowing what it was.  I tried to explain it was just a label, and that it meant that some things were harder for him and that he would have to work harder at some things.  I also told him that no one knows everything, and that labels are just words people make up, so if he wants to reject it, that's fine with me.  In other words, I have tried to give him control over whether to take that label or not.    I have also tried to focus on specifically what's hard for him, without using the label.  For example, we talk about how language is difficult for him.  He has his own way of approaching this, e.g., he said the other day that his brother has more words than he does.  He also knows, because it's obvious, that his fine motor skills are not as good as his brothers.  He says his brother has GREAT handwriting.  However, because we aren't comparing against 30 kids who are all the same except for him, it just isn't as big a deal.  Other things that are challenges, well we just talk openly about the challenges and work on them, but we don't have to use special words.  We just live.  Aside from that, what I've done is to just occasionally talk about autism in the abstract, but usually without saying anything about him.  For example, I found an Arthur episode which we watched.  I just turned it on and sat down and started watching it, so my kids came and watched it with me.  Then we watched a youtube video featuring rosie king when she was a young girl.  that youtube video introduced several autistic children, who talked about their experiences.  We just watched that together.  I have had to have more explicit conversations with his twin brother, because they were unavoidable.  Sometimes his twin feels like there are double standards in the house, so that has required us to dance a very delicate dance.  We tried to integrate into a summer camp this year, which didn't work well at all, for other reasons I won't go into here.  But while we were there, my son did immediately begin to notice a difference.  I went with my son as a support person, so his first question was, how come nobody else's mother was there?  When things got unpleasant and difficult we left the room to go elsewhere, so his next question was, why was everyone else (including his twin brother!) required to stay?     The truth is, there was no good answer to those questions, especially because his brother was also having a rough time of it, just not bad enough that I could do anything about, and also his brother was unlikely to wind up having a giant meltdown.  But that's taking me to why we all pulled out of the summer camp eventually.  My point is that putting him in with a giant group of other, mostly ""neurotypical"" children is probably going to require you to come up with some explanations sooner rather than later."

My wife and I have not told them yet.  We haven't told them they have autism yet, but we have explained that they're not neurotypical.  They know that the ABA therapists that help them are there because they need help with certain aspects of their behavior.  Yesterday, one of them was crying and after a bit of coaxing, he was able to write out what was bothering him.  Turns out he's been teased at school for the last few years and he remembers every incident.  He's actually well liked and his classmates, in general, are very supportive, but I guess there're going to be a few kids who are going to pick on him.

autism,3ca2tx,AstorReinhardt,3,Mon Jul 6 07:43:32 2015 UTC,"I cannot tell you what to do, of course, but I can give you my thoughts and hope it helps you. I would say you have to think about what would happen if you 'act the part' of an autistic person. What if you do that, and they indeed diagnose you with autism? I would say that you would have more trouble than if you acted like yourself and were not diagnosed: you might get help, sure, but how do you know it is indeed the help you need? You would still have to wonder if there might be something else going on. The only problem is, if you acted like yourself and didn't get a diagnosis of autism, you might be able to get further tests to look for something else. But if you act autistic and get that diagnosis, people are not inclined to look further, and you will be stuck with something that maybe isn't you. In my experience, people who do these tests want to help you. I don't see how lying to these people will help you. And remember, if you do not act like yourself, you will in a way be lying to them.  I remember when I got my diagnosis. It was a feeling of relief: I finally knew what was going on, why I felt so different. And I could finally tap into a wealth of knowledge to find out how to help myself. I wish you that same feeling: to finally know that you're not foolishly doing something wrong, you're just different. However, I am afraid that if you act a part, you won't get that feeling, even if in fact you are autistic! Then there will always be a shadow of doubt. I would say you should not do that to yourself.  If I have assumed anything, I want to apologise in advance. I don't know your exact situation, and I cannot speak for you. I only hope my story might give you some perspective. I know it's hard to assess your own situation without anything to compare it to, so hopefully both the similarities and the differences to your situation will be of help."

It really is, because only you know how you experience the world.  Most social workers are not qualified to diagnose autism. They just like to think they are. My Aspie son, who is not diagnosed, was seeing a social worker for depression for a while. She had him ""diagnosed"" with all kinds of other stuff. Everything except autism. (Although he is not diagnosed with autism, but we all know he has it. It's in the family. Everyone with any clue about it can see it.)   So it's funny that this 'expert' social worker couldn't see what everyone else sees. My son brought up the idea that he had autism and she scoffed and went on about how she would know for sure, there'd be signs, etc, etc. He is very passive and didn't argue with her. He came to me about it, not sure what to do.   He hadn't thought to tell the worker that that I, his mom, am diagnosed. So I suggested he do so, and that shut her up pretty good. He stopped seeing her after that because he realized something important about so-called experts. Which is simply that, they can be wrong. So wrong. LOL   Don't worry about acting. Just be yourself. Stim if you need to, it's supposed to be a safe place for that. Just don't overdo it, that's all.  You might be done by the time you see this message. Hope everything went well."

Here are some nonverbal autistics who can type: one - this one's even right here on reddit, two, three, four - this one's a compilation, five, six. If you're still not convinced, I can get you some more. Also, as written by the autistic in link 2, ""[a] person's humanity is not dependent on their bathroom habits.""  Disability is created by society. To loosely paraphrase a pamphlet (that I can't seem to locate now): being deaf is a disability. It's a disability because society was designed for people who can hear. If most people in the world were deaf, society would be designed around sign language and other accessibility tools. Those who could hear would be disabled because very few people would know a spoken language, or understand the need for being quiet in certain situations (not laughing loudly, stomping feet, slamming doors, etc). It is the same with autism. If most of the world consisted of nonspeaking and incontinent autistics, that is how society would be set up.  If you're not a professional, you don't get to judge the validity of a diagnosis, especially someone you've never even met. But for what it's worth, I have an official diagnosis that was determined by over two hours of intensive testing, including having a psychiatrist stick electrodes on my scalp and read my brainwaves for a while.

We started buying the chewies, and they worked pretty well for a while.    At that age, we didn't even try taking him to the dentist, because he was so aggressive and noncooperative.    After we got him on Risperdal, we were able to do a lot things that we previously were unable to do.    We took him to a pediatric dentist, and he was able to physically exam the teeth.  He has a twin sister who peer modeled and went first.  We also took sunglasses and headphones.    We were unable to get X-rays, because he has an extreme gag reflex.  It unfortunately affects his everyday brushing habits as well.    The doc could tell he needed a lot of work.  We ended up having to go the anesthesia route.  We put sealants on the teeth, which has helped.  He is 12 now, and it is still hard to take him to the dentist.  The hygienist at our dentist has a son on the spectrum, so she's not afraid of the clawing that comes along with trying to get x-rays.    Try to cut down on sugary drinks/foods.  Unfortunately, because of all the sensory issues, brushing and dental hygiene is very complicated.  We tried to peer model mouth wash (because he gets awful bad breath), but that did not work at all.  You might have to shop dentists, but generally there are some very good ones that understand the situation and will help you out in any way.  Do you have a regional center case worker?

What do you wish educators/therapists who work(ed) with your son knew about him/your family? That when I tell you something won't workI am not downplaying your education or experience with autistic kids. Every one is different.  When I say weighted vests/blankets won't work it isn't me just being ornery, it's because the one thing that freaks my son out more than anything is feeling restrained. When you ignore me you're ignoring 8 years of day and night experience, most likely because of something in a textbook.   If you've ever had a particularly bad educator/therapist, what made him/her so bad?  My son's Kindergarten teacher was awful. She just didn't care. An example of her behavior: She calls me to the school saying he is having behavioral issues so I go in expecting him in a meltdown buthe was sitting calmly in his desk and said he didn't know what was wrong. So I go and ask his teacher. She says he ""won't use his gluestick"" So I asked if she had explained what it was,what it did and showed him how it worked. She said ""I don't have time for that"". I was going to the school 7+ times a day when I put my foot down and demanded a different teacher or and aid. Got called maybe 3 times in six months once he got his aid.  If you've ever had a particularly good educator/therapist, what made him/her so good?  They tried to workwith him, a lotof the 'textbook' things used to work with my son don't work. These teachers tried different things. Also, it is amazing how just a tiny bit of understanding will go.  Has anyone ever told you anything that was really comforting or clarifying? My son is still not potty trained. I finally got him to a gastrointestinal doctor who was the first person to ever not act itwas a huge deal that myson, then 6,  wasn't potty trained. He said the average age he sees autistic children pottytrain was 9 and I was doing nothing wrong. Honestly, I sat in my car after and cried 4 years of shame out.  Any other wisdom for someone in the beginning of a career working with kids with autism? Most of the time parents are not trying to be mean, we are just so used to everything being made into such a big deal and fighting for what should be the most basic things for.our kids we tend to go into every new situation in tiger-mode.

Ours is also not trained.  However, the therapist has been training him and just last week I witnessed something that made me CRY like crazy.  It was time for his bath and before he got in the bath, he sat on the toilet and peed.  AND I DID NOT PROMPT HIM.  In fact, I had no idea that part of his training was connected with the bath (I'm divorced and don't get to witness the vast majority of the training).  The next day my ex told me to try having him go about 10 minutes after a meal.  So I did that.  I told him about 10 minutes after lunch ""Potty time"" and ""sit down.. sit down""  and of course ""pants off..""  And you know what....  He went POO!  He did it!!  It was so gratifying.

autism,3bsim8,Prinzen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:37 2015 UTC,"Bad - never ever give parents parenting advice unless they ask.  Never assume you know better and never ever say anything that would be deemed as knowing better.  Support a parent.  Give advice only when asked.  Never inject your opinion when it is not asked for.  And for me.. NEVER EVER EVER say that vaccines or some other garbage is what is responsible for autism.  Good - listen.  Be natural.  Enjoy being with kids.  I have found that providers who HAVE children are always better because they truly ""get"" children.  If you do not love children, do not be in this field.  Be consistent.  I had one provider periodically get headaches halfway through a day and need to bail.  And sometimes she would inform me 2 days prior to an appointment that she wouldn't be able to do the gig.  She was fired.  Ask a lot of questions about how the parent wants you to act.  For example, I am not strict.  I'm a dad and a guy so I allow my kids to get into dangerous situations because i think they need to learn from painful mistakes (not life threatening of course, but if they break an arm.. they break an arm.. it's learning!)..  So I specifically tell my providers to allow ME to do the discipline and assume that ANYTHING the kid does (within reason) is perfectly okay with me.  I'll even go as far as to prepare the caregiver by saying something like ""look today he is probably going to be pushing people out of the way to get on rides.. and he won't be able to follow directions... LET THE REST OF THE WORLD DEAL WITH THAT REALITY.  Let him enjoy and be a kid and don't prevent him from annoying others....""  And at the same time I'll also have that caregiver inform all the adults in authority about what is going on and why my son is pushing everyone out fo the way.  (many are understanding and will just let it be)  Ask a lot of questions about how the parent expects you to parent the children.  Because even though you are a provider, you spend enough time with the child that you are also a parent.  Another example is I tell my providers that if he asks for candy, just give him candy.  Now, do I care about his diet... of course.  But I'll worry about the parent/diet dynamic myself.  I don't want my provider inserting their own diet beliefs into my life.  As far as comfort or clarity - again, do more listening than talking.  If the parent is specifically asking you for something, then provide the information.  I'm sure parents want to know that other kids you are caring for are even worse off (terrible, but true).  And they also want to hear stories of successes - even small ones.  But only offer these if the parent is expressing a desire for such info.  Too many providers have acted like they know all and know what you need and ""what you are doing wrong"" .. and of course that is the worst experience ever."

I am a parent with a kid on the spectrum, but I have done a lot of research on what autistic adults say, and one major complaint is that parents and caregivers see autism as something separate from the child. Autistic adults report that autism is part of them and their identity.  As a parent, I have learned to have faith in my child and look at progress made rather than what their peers are doing. Also, find one thing you like and spoil yourself in that department. I like soft things and sweet snacks. What makes you feel safe and pampered.  I have no substantial advice to give other then inquiring about meds. When kiddos have sleep issues it affects them throughout the day. There is no shame on asking the pediatrician about medications for sleep or whatever will help the little guy manage."
autism,3bsim8,They_Beat_Me,2,Thu Jul 2 03:55:59 2015 UTC,Agree that it is best to treat your special needs person as an individual and not make assumptions.  Mine sometimes shows signs of sadness.  Whimpering or just no smiles or lathargic.  But 99% of the time he is smiling and laughing and communicating in all the non-verbal ways that he has a good life.  We do everything we can to help him have a good life.  We take him everywhere and always experiment to see if certain places and experience will work for him.  My ex wife had the crazy idea to take him to see Brian Adams.  Insane - right?  All that sensory stimulation.  And you know what happened?  He LOVED it.

I like to think of myself as a calm, easygoing individual who can blend in, but I know full well that I'm not, and this is part of the reason why I become so anxious in social situations. It creates a feedback loop because the more anxious I become, the more awkwardly I act, and the more awkwardly I act, the more anxious I tend to become.   I definitely identified with the main character, and his attempts to be spontaneous and witty and break the ""autistic stereotype"", but it was just so painful to watch because of how close to home it hit.

autism,3bkg1k,mr_bigmouth_502,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:00:14 2015 UTC,"This movie was very enjoyable! I did skip a few scenes to get to the really emotional parts, but I loved it. I could really see myself in the both of them (her liking him but being very awkward and just saying things that you usually should not say quickly), and how he tries to get out and talk, but things just come out in a way that makes him seem really weird). The lead even talked similar to how I do.   But my feelings for this movie are mainly caused by the romance, and how it's awkward and quiet, but it filled with emotion, and how it shows an important part of autism that a lot of people forget (that being that Autism affects your personality, which is something people don't seem to understand when you tell them that Autistics do not want to be cured because it would change them). I also liked how the actors are actually Autistic and not people who know nothing about it."
autism,3biob5,embracingthespectrum,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"The title should be ""10 Important Questions about Autism representing just ONE person on the autism spectrum"".  Everyone on the spectrum will give varied answers to these questions, and so I'd argue that the questions haven't been 'answered' per se, but just that feedback from one respondent only gives one respondent's experience."
autism,3biob5,BadWhippet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:16:22 2015 UTC,"It's part of a series and I could play with semantics all day long, but it's clearly noted ON the blog that its one person's perspective and that more interviews were coming."
autism,3bif56,CJSingleton,2,Mon Jun 29 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting a case study involving autistic adults. If I were in the UK I would definitely participate.   Seriously, there are too many studies that only involve children and parents. Thank you."
autism,3bgfdx,Alwayswrite64,9,Mon Jun 29 00:22:02 2015 UTC,"This is on point. I honestly wish more parents talked to their children, asked them questions like ""do you mind me talking about X with people?"" and treated them like somewhat equal. That's something my parents have done with me and nothing my mother says to other people about me is something I don't want her to talk about. She's asked permission and I gave it, because I will do the same and sometimes, if she's around, will defer to her as a mouthpiece for me, which she's happy to do when I cannot verbalise. That is the kind of respect parents need to have for their children, disabled or not, but especially for disabled kids. We're already dealing with enough, we don't need it from the people who claim to love and support us."
autism,3bgfdx,purpleblossom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:36:18 2015 UTC,And the ones that don't talk or can't comprehend the question?
autism,3bgfdx,GrammerPants,2,Wed Jul 1 04:29:29 2015 UTC,"If you're unable to get an answer from them for whatever reason, just use your best judgement - if you were [insert child's age], would you want your parents posting this kind of thing about you on the internet where anyone can see it? (""Well, s/he won't find out anyway"" is not an answer.) If you aren't sure, don't post it."
autism,3bgfdx,cakeisatruth,0,Wed Jul 1 05:57:20 2015 UTC,No. My kids my choice. I'm sorry but I don't see the difference between talking to the neighbour about it and posting it online. The child isn't the only one going through this.
autism,3bgfdx,GrammerPants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"Are you being serious? There is a huge difference between telling one neighbor who lives close by, and posting it on the internet where it can be seen by hundreds of millions of people."
autism,3bgfdx,cakeisatruth,5,Wed Jul 1 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"When I comment on either of my children I never give away their identities, and I certainly don't go into too much detail. One day my sons will be experiencing places like this for themselves and I don't want them to have any nasty surprises.  I can understand when people need advice on issues and they get desperate. They feel like they're not being understood so they feel they have to post every small and cringe-worthy detail of their problem. But I also find not only the lack of consideration for their child's privacy alarming, but how shameless they are in treating the situation like a massive inconvenience."
autism,3bfaoo,TheGodOfAutism,13,Sun Jun 28 18:33:59 2015 UTC,"It could be. Very specific and focused interests are also a huge part of autism. Can you give an example of what you mean by repetitive questioning?  For me, I know that I tend to ask the same question over and over if I don't feel I've gotten a satisfactory answer. (Like if I ask, ""What time will you be home from the movies?"" and the answer is, ""Well, the movie ends at six."") Also, some people experience echolalia or palilalia, which is repeating yourself or other people almost automatically with difficulty stopping it."
autism,3bfaoo,cakeisatruth,5,Sun Jun 28 19:29:41 2015 UTC,"I can see how that would be annoying, they haven't actually answered your question, they've just said when the movie will end and expect you to fill in the rest. But you don't know how long they'll take to come back, whether they'll stop anywhere first."
autism,3bfaoo,skellious,3,Sun Jun 28 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's it exactly."
autism,3bfaoo,cakeisatruth,3,Sun Jun 28 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"By repetitive questioning I mean always asking how severe my autism is during my psychiatric visits, always asking questions related to neuroscience which I know the answer to, etc. It's usually asking questions I know the answer to, repetitively, but in different social instances (that is, I don't just repeat the question over and over)."
autism,3bfaoo,cakeisatruth,3,Mon Jun 29 10:05:57 2015 UTC,I can recall doing something similar as a kid. I think my logic was that I wanted to see if the answer would change. Is that why you do it?
autism,3bfaoo,skellious,6,Mon Jun 29 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"I am kinda the opposite, I tend to tell people the same things a lot, possibly because I am poor at keeping my memories of who I've told what separate so I end up telling the same person the same thing several times."
autism,3bfaoo,suamac,2,Sun Jun 28 22:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially if the topic is one that is of high interest. Majority of my students with autism (I'm a teacher) display this trait."
autism,3bfaoo,TheLastFighter,5,Sun Jun 28 23:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. For my son it usually has to do with things he is interested but also things that give him anxiety such as things he has yet to experience, out of schedule or time frames."
autism,3bfaoo,Thameus,3,Mon Jun 29 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Boy, is it ever."
autism,3bfaoo,wkpaccount,2,Mon Jun 29 01:43:00 2015 UTC,Why do you ask repetitive questions? What kinds of things do you ask about?
autism,3bfaoo,peoooooo,3,Sun Jun 28 19:41:25 2015 UTC,really i ask questions that i know the answer to except i do not know why
autism,3bfaoo,Calestia,2,Mon Jun 29 18:11:50 2015 UTC,Maybe its reassuring for yourself to know what you want.
autism,3bfaoo,Muzical84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"For me, I only do this verbally, but I also have poop auditory processing, so someone has to repeat it several times before I can remember."
autism,3bfaoo,choirsofcacophony,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"I do this often, even if I know the answer.  I think it's a reassurance thing bc it ramps up when I'm anxious.  I also have some echolalia so I repeat what I hear.  I also tend to repeat questions when I don't feel like the person answered it, like cakeisatruth said."
autism,3bfuyk,geo2015,6,Sun Jun 28 21:22:34 2015 UTC,Try to figure out what the antecedent to the behaviour is
autism,3bfuyk,joshanaitor,4,Sun Jun 28 21:32:45 2015 UTC,"Self-harm (in many different forms) is pretty common in people with autism, yes. Good that you're ruling out medical causes, that was going to be my first suggestion.  As others have said, the solution will depend on why he's doing this. I would suggest getting him some toys or other material he can scratch, so he can express the need without hurting anyone. There's a type of paper meant for ""scratch art"" which might help, and is very visually stimulating as well."
autism,3bfuyk,cakeisatruth,3,Sun Jun 28 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, try cutting his nails while he's asleep."
autism,3bfuyk,WonkyOne,5,Mon Jun 29 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"I've been warned that this could lead to ""trust issues"", but in the end that's what I've done with both of my girls who have far too many sensitivities to having their nails trimmed and whom didn't seem to mind at all waking up with them trimmed (they didn't seem to notice at all). For a while I just let it go but then both child and parents would end up with bloody scratches at times. The oldest doesn't mind her nails being trimmed at all now (we continued to work on desensitizing when awake, but having an alternative sure took the pressure off)   Pro-tip that I didn't think of until child #2 - a flexible book light makes sneaking in and targeted lighting far easier than a flashlight in your mouth."
autism,3bfuyk,malica77,3,Mon Jun 29 04:45:10 2015 UTC,"Well, 'face' is still a centralized location. He could be scratching his arm, his torso, his neck, his leg, etc but instead he's focusing on the face. I wouldn't write off a physical cause just yet, especially when it comes to things difficult to pinpoint like allergies.  How does he seem when he scratches? Is he frustrated, scared, angry, happy? Does he fixate on areas that have scabbed over or only on unscratched areas? His emotional state and the way he's scratching himself can give you a lot of clues for the why behind it. He may be doing it because he can't deal with his emotions, he might be doing it because he's sensory-seeking and it actually feels good to him, he might just like the feeling of picking at scabs, etc, and what will work as a solution is heavily dependent on why he's doing it."
autism,3bfuyk,zugunruh3,3,Sun Jun 28 21:29:39 2015 UTC,It is common for children with ASD to engage in self-injurious behavior.
autism,3bfuyk,SkinnerRox,3,Sun Jun 28 22:03:49 2015 UTC,"Filing is absolutely preferable, because it allows you to control how blunt/sharp the nails will be when you're done. Experiment on your own nails to get a nice blunt edge.   This one's kind of a last resort but - you might also teach him to get the scratching stimulation by pushing rather than pulling his hands, which will not damage the skin.  If he's looking for stimulation to his face rather than to his hands, a lot of cloth can have a ""rough"" texture is going to feel good without actually being harmful. I would recommend giving him a towel that's been washed several times without fabric softener, or a cheap cotton fabric. I personally also really love bubbly crochet textures, but those are obviously generally going to have to be made at home. If your son turns out to like rubbing his face in cloth, I can either make you some or recommend some patterns.  Alternately, if either you or your wife are in possession of a precious pair of cold hands, try firmly pressing them to the area he is scratching before he really starts to get going - if that works, he might be seeking relief for an actual itch. In that case, a cold compress or just letting him spritz his face with a bit of water for the evaporation cool might work."
autism,3bfuyk,nadeshdara,3,Mon Jun 29 06:24:54 2015 UTC,"Our son used to hit himself in the chin. Every time he would do this we would tell him to clap his hands. This worked - I'm not sure if it was that clapping hard enough caused a noise and a feeling in his hands, or why he was okay with exchanging them. Eventually he stopped both.  The idea about scratch art from /u/cakeisatruth is pretty cool."
