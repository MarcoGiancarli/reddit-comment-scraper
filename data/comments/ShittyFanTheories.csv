ShittyFanTheories,3d26ta,GinjaNinger,2,Mon Jul 13 11:05:18 2015 UTC,Wait wait wait a minute. This sing is about me. Had always been about me. Will always be about me. So back up bucko.   Source: also never met Carly Simon.

ShittyFanTheories,3d3j6k,bhtesa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"Rites of Spring (album):       Rites of Spring is the first and only studio album released by influential DC post-hardcore band Rites of Spring. It was recorded at Inner Ear Studios in February 1985 and released on vinyl in June 1985 as Dischord Records #16. The albulm was produced by Ian MacKaye and contains twelve songs.  The album was re-released on CD and cassette in 1987, with an additional track from the same session, ""Other Way Around"", as well as the four songs from the Rites' follow-up EP, All Through a Life (track 14–17), recorded January 1986 and released in 1987 (Dischord #22). End on End features the same cover as the debut album.  The CD and cassette originally retained the number ""16"", while the 1991 repress, as well as the 2001 remastered version of the same seventeen songs, were numbered ""16CD"" and given the new title ""End On End"".

ShittyFanTheories,3d3j6k,dubbadawg,2,Sat Jul 18 22:16:49 2015 UTC,"Conjures up sympathy and pity for various men really down on their luck. Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets has songs about the guy in the electric chair, the guy trapped under ice, that one suicidal guy fading to black, the guy in the sanitarium, the guy who dies on the front line in war, the guy chopping his breakfast on a mirror, etc. Most of these aren't really guys that even the ""everyman"" really comes across. And then their mega hit, ""One"" from the Justice album... that has got to be the most ""everybody-give-it-up-for-this-poor-guy"" song ever put to metal music. These are not happy songs, these are glam metal buzzkill songs that sent would-be glam metal groupies away from Poison concerts over to gothic industrial dance clubs.  Kill 'Em All was their only real ""let's party like it's 1999 album"" with songs about hitting the lights, jumping in the fire, searching and destroying, stabbing harlots, etc.  In a way it makes you wonder how we got to dominating the enemy to feeling like we're attending funerals of poor downtrodden bastards. Their last party song was Damage Inc, even though Puppets was mostly an emo album.  This is why Venom beats the snot out of all of /r/dsbm, if you ask me. Venom is a black metal band that parties their balls off, and all the other black metal bands couldn't get their dicks wet if they were surrounded by drunk and horny naked chicks in a swimming pool. If it's emo, it's not on my iPod, that's my rule - even if it's metal."
ShittyFanTheories,3d034e,DeseretRain,5,Sun Jul 12 10:14:08 2015 UTC,Was her disappointment in her son being so annoying fake too?
ShittyFanTheories,3d034e,lamberfunk,4,Sun Jul 12 13:38:05 2015 UTC,"You'll notice at the beginning of the movie, when her son is acting up and getting kicked out of school, she's very defensive of him and doesn't seem bothered by his behavior at all. It's ONLY when he starts talking about the Babadook that she starts seeming annoying by his behavior. That should answer your question."
ShittyFanTheories,3cssqj,CanadianGladiator,15,Fri Jul 10 14:09:52 2015 UTC,"Obviously they were talking about the Berlin Wall, and the fall of Soviet Russia."
