dancegavindance,3e36im,lazenbooby,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:44 2015 UTC,Just listened to it again on that link and I still hear it. I thought I was hearing things at first too until I decided to replay it a couple of times. It's very faint.
dancegavindance,3e36im,lazenbooby,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:49 2015 UTC,What kind of noise is it?
dancegavindance,3e36im,HelloDepression,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:02 2015 UTC,"Just three, maybe four beeps (like pager or cell ringtone). Starts midway through ""beautiful"""
dancegavindance,3e36im,FallenStory,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yea, I hear it too. I've always heard it and never thought twice about it. It sounds like the lead guitar or just some electronic effect added in. He's not crazy haha"
dancegavindance,3e36im,oceanic_815,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:48:48 2015 UTC,Idk it just seems out of place to me and sounds like a phone ringer. I'll ask the band if they know anything about it at Treasure Fest this weekend.

dancegavindance,3d8lxd,PeanutButtHer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:10 2015 UTC,I think the mixing sort of adds to the song and makes it sound a bit amateur which is a bit different but not bad at all.

The ending and chorus of Caviar is absolutely beautiful to me, and the chorus to Happiness is phenomenal as well. Also the ending to Surprise!

dancegavindance,3d5k27,Kanex,7,Mon Jul 13 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"This would have been my answer. Whenever I introduce someone to DGD, that part is always one of the things I start to show them.   When the song first came, I was sitting next to my crush on a bus (she didn't know) going on a club trip. I was already hyped for a new DGD album so when I checked Reddit and saw they posted a new song after that amazing Jon Mess teaser, I freaked the fuck out trying to keep my calm because I was sitting next to her. I rushed to YouTube and fell in love because everything was crisp, clear, and smooth. You could hear every member of the band just perfectly. Then when Tilian's final part hit, I almost lost my shit. I was telling myself how well he molded himself into the band. I could see my crush just constantly looking at me as I was holding back tears and emotions from watching this video with random creatures and words.   I should've made my move and made her listen as well. Fuck!   Edit: I also just realized that the song came out before Valentine's Day! It was the perfect moment and I blew it!"

Needless to say I shed a tear and have listened to it every day since then. The last line 'if you could just wake up tonight; I'd be with you under the sky, with you tonight' just stood out like nothing else before, and I've been listening to dgd for at least 8 years, and they are by far my most attended live band   Second contender is last line in rain in Vietnam - 'blood stains my blades from taking hearts as ornaments', with the guitar just fading out behind Jonny again.

dancegavindance,3d5k27,jayteeayy,2,Wed Jul 15 04:36:16 2015 UTC,No I kinda agree. Mainly my other 2 friends were getting bad vibes so we had to skip to the interlude.

The album is centered around Jon's lyrical madness as opposed to Tilian's vocals, while Tilian only lays out softness to ease the harsh screams of the Messiah. He doesn't have to many actual lyrical parts. Will screams too.   As for the overall sound, something akin to DBM. Imagine Secret Band but with Tilian singing backup and far more intricate and pop-related riffs, a la AS and IG, with the high quality production of the last two albums."

This is the plural of the word, Corpus, which means a collection of writings, conversations, and speeches.   For the concept? I imagine that it will introduce new characters inside a city through Mattias' art collection. Each character has the same style as previous but of course different looks. A continuation to the artwork I imagine. This time, we see more works from certain people in the band separately. For example, we see Johnny Craig guest starring with Tilian on a song that just evinces every emotion out of someone. Anger, sadness, happiness through the chill of their voices. You can hear their soul as their tones raise higher and higher. Will giving an amazing high-pitched guitar playing in the background, then everything just breaks down as they begin to sing together in unison.   I just imagine that this next album, since Tilian has finally molded himself into the band, they will be able to experiment more and more and creates sequels, maybe have a very long song called DBMIII with Johnny as most people wish for rather than an entire album. It'll have a variety of artwork, solos, and a place for everyone to shine and rise on that song. Thus the name, Corpora. It'll give off many emotions and talents of every member. We'll most likely see the start of a new series too. Idk, so much possibility. I'll end my rant now haha."

Half of the songs I loved and the other half bored me to tears (especially with Bradley's harmonies that were just grating).  Honestly, I was a bigger fan of their style in Relativity because it was a bit more raw, and while I'm not the biggest fan of this song, I still like it and I like it more than half of the songs on Versus.  I really liked Supercow though and think that style would have been badass.  Mikey Sawyer does an audition for Emarosa with this same song and it's called I Still Feel Her pt. 5 and I'd definitely recommend checking it out."

dancegavindance,3ccviz,TheMightyCaige,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:58:34 2015 UTC,Yes. But the Death Star album really sealed the deal.
dancegavindance,3ccviz,DavidsonEscPlan,8,Sun Jul 12 03:27:46 2015 UTC,"I did both of these at once because ""Untitled"" would be a pretty shitty discussion thread on it's own. It's only like 50 seconds and let's face it, even though it's amazing we wouldn't have that much to discuss for a song so small.  Easily one of my favourite DGD songs of all time. I actually deleted these 2 songs from my ipod and added them as one song, because I love the way Untitled fades in so much.  The changes in tempo make this song in my opinion, the way it bursts out just makes you want to bounce around, yet it calms down for ""Stranded here in this cold atmosphere"" and continues to change back and forth. I love it! It's all the bounciness of DGD and all the chill funkiness rolled into one sexy ball of sound.  You know in Emarosa's 'The Past Should Stay Dead', where you can't help but scream ""TAILORED SHEEEETS""? I can't help but do the same with ""BUT NOW YOU KNOWWWW, THAT I AM COOOOLD"". I feel like Cartman in that South Park episode where he has to finish that song every time someone starts it.   I've never really taken much note to the last two lines, I just noticed them and well, they're beautiful!;   Left at my feet rests the soul of my brother  Vengeance will fall for the deeds of another"

dancegavindance,3ccviz,maverick2b,7,Tue Jul 7 22:28:09 2015 UTC,"DBM is easily my favorite DGD album, and this song is what really got me hooked. Doesn't hurt that it's the first track (well, untitled but comeon). I just love the combo of Mess and Craig's voices throughout this entire album, it just flows. ""You thought the price of your life was devout"" is my favorite line."
dancegavindance,3ccviz,TheMightyCaige,5,Tue Jul 7 23:42:43 2015 UTC,"Even though DBM is my least favorite of the full lengths, this is an awesome song. The guitar and drum work is very catchy and Jonny is the most passionate I've ever heard him. Jon is somewhat incomprehensible (one of my main issues with the album as a whole), but I do like how raw he sounds. Of course, I love how Untitled transitions into And I Told Them."
dancegavindance,3ccviz,benwhilson,5,Tue Jul 7 01:39:24 2015 UTC,This is still my favorite beginning to any of their albums. Also does anyone know the chord progression on Untitled?
dancegavindance,3ccviz,SirHuffDaddy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:02:33 2015 UTC,I totally feel you there. It has the best start to an album by far. Sometimes I skip Untitled just because I really like how fast AITTIITNR starts. On The Run reminds me of it - starts off fast and furious.
dancegavindance,3ccviz,CovetedBody,3,Sun Jul 12 03:28:38 2015 UTC,"Aw man, the intro to my all time favorite album by my favorite band. This is what I first heard by dgd that got me into them 6-7 years ago. So long ago..."

Nothing against DGD but MERCHNOW really left a bad taste in my mouth.  The clear is cool nothing special. I was really looking forward to the oxblood variant, especially after waiting over two months for it.  Everything else about the album is great though. Nice quality cover, the gatefold looks awesome. Free CD and the lyrics sheet is heavy paper with great artwork    On the back."

dancegavindance,3ccbup,kicknhobo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:26:41 2015 UTC,Ha. Yea. This is true. It was just a weird situation that I think confused a lot of people. I heard there were a lot of cancelations because of the delay and then a backlash because of the variant they repressed. I may end up buying the oxblood eventually.

dancegavindance,3c4vib,lazenbooby,2,Sat Jul 4 23:35:43 2015 UTC,Thanks :) I really enjoy making stuff like this!
dancegavindance,3c4vib,Lapper,3,Sun Jul 5 09:21:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, did you come up with that map idea? That's super cool."
dancegavindance,3c4vib,JSBUCK,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:40:38 2015 UTC,Indeed. See my response here for the rationale behind the whole concept
dancegavindance,3c4vib,Recke89,3,Sun Jul 5 09:49:32 2015 UTC,Nice cover! That electronic kit emulates the sound of real drums very well. It's pretty surprising when most electronic kits can't even compare to the sound of real drums.  What's the point of the mapping? Did you have to do that yourself or do have a program that maps out the hits?
dancegavindance,3c4vib,AOhls14,4,Sun Jul 5 06:16:20 2015 UTC,"I've made videos in the past, and seen videos from others, where people have commented asking for ""drum tabs"" or music on how to play something.  I figured I'd make something that converted my playing into a familiar format - sort of a guitar hero style output. That way, everyone can see what I'm playing, even those who can't read music. Music is transient and its annoying to have to replay a part of a video to work something out. But if you can see the beat, you can always pause a video just to figure out that fill.  It's done in After Effects. I made a small plugin that takes the MIDI, looks ahead 2 seconds or so, and triggers animations (in this case, letters running down the screen)."

dancegavindance,3c5hid,XxMicheleMessxX,11,Sun Jul 5 00:05:31 2015 UTC,"What music is he normally into? If he doesn't normally like screaming and such, first go for some of the softer songs like Uneasy Hearts Weigh The Most or groovier/catchier songs like Death of a Strawberry. If he likes heavier stuff and breakdowns a lot, maybe go with Shark Dad or something. Also consider the different singers, and which voice you think he'd prefer - that makes a big difference for people, especially new listeners.  My girlfriend isn't a DGD or even 'heavy' music fan by any means, but DGD has such a diverse range of music that I found a few songs to ease her into the elements she didn't like as much, and now she doesn't mind them in small doses every now and then."
dancegavindance,3c5hid,cabletv99,4,Sun Jul 5 02:08:41 2015 UTC,He's one of those people who will literally listen to anything so idk. I know he listens to Death Metal so I might start with some of the heavier things.
dancegavindance,3c5hid,DavidR525,6,Sun Jul 5 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"Then go for Shark Dad, Need Money, and People You Know"
dancegavindance,3c5hid,cabletv99,3,Mon Jul 6 03:10:30 2015 UTC,Yeah maybe try to avoid some of the 'cheesier' songs to begin with. Jonny Craig's raspier vocals might be something to consider? Good luck!

dancegavindance,3c5hid,Y_Machina,3,Mon Jul 6 04:32:16 2015 UTC,Your best bet however is to look at their recent setlists and familiarise him with those songs. He'll enjoy the gig WAY more if he knows the music!

Lighting in my room sucks and I tried to edit it so it wouldn't look so yellow and discolored. Looks a TON better in person. Hm to be honest this was my idea first but he took it since I didn't have the money to get it done (multiple sessions) and I love it on him. He's a walking advert.   Good luck on your piece!

I am legitimately writing a letter to the company and sending it to them. I honestly feel like merchnow should be even boycotted, or at least withheld from service until they get their shit together. No one should have to deal with their services. They are horrible distributors, they have horrible coustomer service, and they pull cheap tricks like this. I'm sad to say that it makes me never want to buy any merch again offline. I'd rather go to shows just to buy merch than try to compete with them.  Fuck merchnow dude.

dancegavindance,3bi9t6,tylerseher,4,Tue Jun 30 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it took me a while to get into this song. It's one of the few DGD songs I didn't originally love, but now when it comes on I'm all ""Errrmageerrrddd, itz Cevierrr!"".   The guitar that kicks in just before the vocals start is cool as fuck. But what else would we expect from Will and Zach?  It's unbelievably chill to listen to. The start of the chorus ""Youuuuuuu"" sends chills down my spine and is so different/unique from everything else DGD has done."
dancegavindance,3bi9t6,CovetedBody,3,Mon Jun 29 13:55:43 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better myself. It's one of my favorite for just a chill moment or when I'm thinking of someone I'm interested in. It's just that ""moment"" song for me. I love and enjoy it when it just plays in the background. ""Youuuuu speak of awe."" It's just amazing with the flow and tone it takes."
dancegavindance,3bi9t6,coolisness,2,Mon Jun 29 17:20:00 2015 UTC,Exactly how I feel.  One of my fav DGD songs.

And the guitars and bass form this shimmering wall of sound that is both atmospheric and technical. I get lost in this song."
dancegavindance,3bi9t6,Y_Machina,2,Wed Jul 1 09:46:46 2015 UTC,I'm so glad there's other people who understand the imagery this band creates.

dancegavindance,3bhprr,PeanutButtHer,2,Mon Jun 29 12:52:33 2015 UTC,I'm glad everyone liked the question I asked the band.   For about a year or so I was curious to know if the Blue Dream phone call was improvised or scripted (I was already aware that the Rock Solid conversation was improvised) but I would never remember to ask them whenever I saw then live.
dancegavindance,3bhprr,manlysuperpanda,3,Mon Jun 29 17:02:55 2015 UTC,I really thought they would answer my question about the Matt Geise project since it was the most upvoted comment lol. I don't think it's going to happen tbh
dancegavindance,3bhprr,coldjeanz,0,Mon Jun 29 21:32:54 2015 UTC,??  I love DGD but I thought the Rock Solid conversation was inspired / taken from  Sublime- 40 oz to Freedom  Starting at 1:10   I always thought this was a throwback to Sublime?   Guess I should have asked in the AMA.
dancegavindance,3bhprr,Creampo0f,5,Mon Jun 29 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"I doubt it was inspired by that, and definitely wasn't taken. The two parts are completely different."

But yeah, after listening again I agree that it's probably  just a coincidence.   Just people talking during a song.  These are common topics.  Again, huge fan here, just always thought that's where they got the idea from.  Now I see that they've said many times in interviews that it was just random."

For example,  On ""Choice"":    maybe I should look in the mirror and face it I just need to stop the hurt.   On ""Not Faking"" was my personal favourite as I relate to it the most:   The pain is real okay? It’s not something I just made up I love you okay? Why don’t you give a fuck?   Two Thirty to Seven I could actually hear Jon's voice in and plus the Hail The Sun reference (I imagine it is) caught me too -- Haha, Patients and Patience  Saving Your Own Life was amazing.

dancegavindance,3ba3xn,caseharts,3,Sat Jun 27 14:39:22 2015 UTC,what? Ever since picking tillian up they havent even hinted at such. Before that they had but they said with the success of instant gratification they were back in it and ready to go. I think tillian is staying and theyre in it to win it. Theyre one of the few bands where they can do whatever they want and we will accept them and love it. edit: they did say if instant gratification wasnt a big success theyd have to rethink but based on everything I have seen its been rise's biggest album if not one of the biggest this year.
dancegavindance,3ba3xn,lazenbooby,2,Sat Jun 27 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"I remember when Tilian joined that they said they'd considered calling it quits, so when the album was called ""Acceptance Speech"" I thought it was the end. They've proved me wrong though!"
dancegavindance,3ba3xn,stallfishy,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:54:47 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong but I think they signed with Rise for 3 more albums or something after they released AS, so unless something serious happens they'll stick around for a little while longer I hope."
dancegavindance,3ba3xn,DavidR525,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:23:06 2015 UTC,The contract was signed before Acceptance Speech and was for three albums so they have one more album with Rise until it expires

dancegavindance,3ar0xu,HelloDepression,12,Mon Jun 22 20:28:03 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite song of Jon Mess. Whenever I listen to it, I am amazed by how clear I can hear his screams. It's like I can hear his energy and passion. It's quintessential of a DGD song. It contains some of my favorite lyrics as well:    Small world syndrome, I can hear your criticism, buh- buh- bouncing off the base of my buttons. (Meaningless) You bluffin. I could go get the biggest brick so you could break in. I could constrict the citizen to make a payment.  Talk about your feelings. I'm goin pitch black. Talk about my feelings. I don't wanna, fuck that. It don't believe me I mustn't whip that. Soft as the pillow is, ship this shit back.   The alliteration, the flow, the way it's performed, the energy, and the feel is just all amazing. Whenever it gets to that point in the song, I MUST turn it all the way up. Tilian's flow is great as well with the verse preceding this one.   Also, thanks to /u/lazenbooby for starting this up! :)"
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,CovetedBody,3,Mon Jun 22 20:43:35 2015 UTC,"Also, thanks to /u/lazenbooby for starting this up! :)   Thanks to /u/covetedbody for suggesting it, it's a great idea! :)"
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,DavidR525,3,Mon Jun 22 20:49:05 2015 UTC,no problem homie. I do feel super special being mentioned in the Wiki though!
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,DanceAlexDance93,6,Mon Jun 22 21:26:18 2015 UTC,I love the groovy guitar parts with the screams over them. It feels like I can groove to it and mosh to it at the same time
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,barthreesymmetry,6,Mon Jun 22 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly, The Cuddler is one of my least favourite on Instant Gratification, but that doesn't make it a bad song at all. It's still completely fucking kick-ass.  Personally, some of the lyrics in this song hit me kinda hard. They especially did around the time the album came out too, which I guess sucked. But that's the great thing about music, right? I especially relate to:    Talk about your feelings I’m goin pitch black  Talk about my feelings I don’t wanna, fuck that   I love Tilian's background ""Oohhhh"" behind Jon's vocals after the first 30 seconds, which then blends into his chorus of ""And I'm assuming that you're worth it..."", it just sounds really satisfying and builds up perfectly."
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,GalacticCatt,4,Mon Jun 22 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"This rhythm section on this song (and the rest of the album) just lock it in SOOOOOOOOOO well!  I really love that the bass (in my opinion) drives the song, especially in verses; very melodic."
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,CovetedBody,5,Mon Jun 22 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"They put this one in between awkward and legend, which I find to be closely related. It makes sense to me that these two songs would list adjacent. Awkward; by the youth to the elders, legend; by the elders to the youth."
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,GalacticCatt,5,Tue Jun 23 01:54:16 2015 UTC,I guess now would be a good time to see if anybody would like to see me cover this song. It's my favorite DGD song to play on bass. Maybe I can cover every song of the week.
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,Prisonme69,3,Tue Jun 23 03:56:57 2015 UTC,That would be radical
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,TheMightyCaige,2,Tue Jun 23 04:31:15 2015 UTC,groovy!
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,Y_Machina,3,Tue Jun 23 04:31:50 2015 UTC,Awesome!
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,coolisness,3,Tue Jun 23 06:44:44 2015 UTC,By the way - The song list is a random order. I shuffled the songs and then moved them so that the same singers/albums weren't together too much.   It's just a coincidence that the song was the same one as the song in the lyric bar!
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,CovetedBody,3,Mon Jun 22 21:13:47 2015 UTC,This song is so perfect. It kills me!
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,DanceAlexDance93,2,Tue Jun 23 04:09:08 2015 UTC,The way it's killin me is perfect
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,blastingmybarriers,3,Sat Jun 27 03:58:37 2015 UTC,"Easily my favorite on  the new record. It makes me think of Pounce Bounce. Every sound is in the place, the bass is wicked cool. Will Swan is just ridiculous. Mingus is ridiculous. Jon Mess and Tillian are ridiculous."
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,barthreesymmetry,3,Thu Jun 25 16:52:59 2015 UTC,"For me, this song was one that I loved when I first heard it, but it hasn't grown on me any more. All the other songs from Instant Gratificatuon I fell more and more in love with. Still one of my favorite songs off the album. Feels like DBM2."
dancegavindance,3ar0xu,DanceShomoDance,2,Thu Jun 25 23:59:12 2015 UTC,One of Jon's most catchiest and punchiest songs. I can't help but sing along to the first couple lines. It reminds me of Rock Solid in that sense.

dancegavindance,3ah4lj,MrTenpenny,4,Sat Jun 20 09:37:11 2015 UTC,"No the higher screams are Alex Bigman. I think Will might scream a little on the song, but the only time you can really hear him is in the chorus of Carbon Copy when he says ""Fail, then adapt""."

I mean 'Lemon Meringue Tie' was the first song I really fell in love with, but I remember putting the first album on expecting the music to be Indie Rock or something (I think it was the album art and the band's name that gave me that impression, it seems really dumb in retrospect). As soon as the song kicked in I was like 'Whoah, did not expect that', but in a good way. A very good way."

dancegavindance,39thun,CovetedBody,13,Sun Jun 14 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"I like Tilian, but he's not my favorite. I'll take him over Jonny any day but that's a different subject. I wanna say I cant see them holding onto Tilian, but then again I cant see Dance Gavin Dance being around for much longer which frightens me. They've been one of the only bands I've stuck with since good-ol' Myspace days.  If Tilian stays for another album or two, I'm only hopeful that the next one is a heavier album among the scale of the Self-Title."
dancegavindance,39thun,ibtmnibtn,10,Sun Jun 14 17:06:22 2015 UTC,"A heavier album would be great, perhaps Tillian can finally slip in his Tides of Man rasp."
dancegavindance,39thun,Keep_on_keepin,4,Sun Jun 14 19:37:29 2015 UTC,"He does bring more grit to his voice in the live performances , but I think he's decided to leave it out on the the studio recordings in order to keep a contrast with Jon."
dancegavindance,39thun,coldjeanz,3,Sun Jun 14 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard of that before, but a raspier and grittier singing style would fit well in a heavier album. It would also freshen up some things because Tillian's pop voice is featured in his solo stuff AND DGD."
dancegavindance,39thun,Keep_on_keepin,2,Sun Jun 14 22:59:43 2015 UTC,Is it weird that I prefer the heavies to stay with secret band and keep the mix they've had since dbm2 I find its a good mix of the two but to each their own! I like the poppiness and ice been here since the ep. Swag all day Bae
dancegavindance,39thun,caseharts,2,Sun Jun 14 20:25:30 2015 UTC,I honestly wish DGD would go back to more of the DBM2 sound.
dancegavindance,39thun,Not_Ben_Stein,10,Mon Jun 15 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"I like this lineup a lot. Jons voice has matured, Tim is an outstanding bassist, and Will and Matts musical connection is the grounding to Dgd.   Tillian has outstanding talent that lots of people seem to like. But with the bands reputation being famous for such vast line-up changes, it's hard to picture him staying around long.   Looking at AS, Tillian had to work around the bands taste while IG, the band work around to fit Tillian's style. I feel like for the line-up to stay around more they're going to have to work on a mix of both.   My opinion is mixed, I wouldn't mind seeing Pearson till the end but a small part of me wants a different singer."
dancegavindance,39thun,indulgeme82,7,Sun Jun 14 18:06:00 2015 UTC,Based on what everyone's said he's the most liked and easiest to work with and enjoys the band so I think he will be there for several more albums if not until the end. I'd love to see abthonyb green on an album with dgd.
dancegavindance,39thun,caseharts,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:24:16 2015 UTC,If Tillian goes which I don't want to happen but if it does.... Matt fucking Geise would be my pick.

dancegavindance,39thun,caseharts,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:28:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is coming back until they are doing one more to retire the band. He will probably be the last singer on their last album. What about  one more Tillian, Geise 1 or 2,close it out with Johnny? I could get down with that."
dancegavindance,39thun,fateislosthope,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:55:59 2015 UTC,I think they have way more than 3 to 4 albums left. But even then not sure why matt geise would join if tillian is likely with the band for the next 5 to 10 years. What is geise even doing now? he needs a band.
dancegavindance,39thun,caseharts,7,Tue Jun 23 04:06:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly I want the last album to be a culmination of all the past singers, Jonny, Kurt, and Tilian like a tribute to DGD. Kinda like that stolas album that featured all of em"
dancegavindance,39thun,Not_Ben_Stein,4,Mon Jun 15 16:09:00 2015 UTC,We can only dream.   But can you imagine!?!
dancegavindance,39thun,indulgeme82,8,Mon Jun 15 17:28:34 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. I like Tilian and wouldn't mind if he stayed, but the constant switching of clean vocalists has actually helped to keep this band fresh imo. I love how they have to tailor the music to match each singer's range but still keep the DGD sound. That's why the lineup changes don't bother me.   I think Tilian has actually said in the past that he won't be in the band until the end because it's just in the nature of DGD to keep changing stuff but he might have been joking?   I'd love to hear a record with Matt Geise on cleans though. He's been out of the game way too long"
dancegavindance,39thun,coldjeanz,3,Sun Jun 14 18:26:11 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more about Matt. He's easily one of my favorite vocalists and I feel as though he should be a strong contender should Tillian leave.
dancegavindance,39thun,ISAPS,2,Sun Jun 14 21:11:10 2015 UTC,If Tillian leaves I don't see how they don't give him a shot.
dancegavindance,39thun,fateislosthope,6,Tue Jun 23 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"I have 2 thoughts on the (possible) directions DGD will take in the future.   In an interview Tilian said that there is no such thing as a permanent DGD vocalist and he'd like to further his solo career. After AS they re-signed to Rise for 2 more albums. They already released IG so they only have 1 more to go before their contract is up. I think they'll release DGD8 with Tilian on Rise, tour it, and then either break up, or sign onto Blue Swan Records.   I think if they signed onto BSR, they'd probably split with Tilian though. I'm not sure how I'd feel about a female vocalist, but I'd love to hear them with Nic Newsham, especially since he almost joined them, or a vocalist that has done something besides post-hardcore. I'd need some convincing for Matt Geise though.  I'd love for Tilian to stay, but DGD having so many vocalists has always been pretty rad."
dancegavindance,39thun,ImAlexNotJose,4,Sun Jun 14 22:09:29 2015 UTC,You need convincing or Matt? I got you. http://youtu.be/t1BuF6e7_4k
dancegavindance,39thun,DanceAlexDance93,3,Mon Jun 15 03:23:31 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm convinced. I tried listening to other Lower D songs, but his vocals just weren't doing it for me, but if he can do this or better, I can see it working out very well."
dancegavindance,39thun,ImAlexNotJose,2,Mon Jun 15 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"FYI,  matt was not the original singer they released a few self released demos and an EP without him. All three major releases are him but if you should try to listen to anything to get you into the band it should be ""The greatest of all lost arts"" he really hits his stride on that album."
dancegavindance,39thun,fateislosthope,6,Tue Jun 23 02:08:21 2015 UTC,I think Jonny should rejoin at some point for a final album. I'd like to hear Matt Geise on a dgd album as well. I love lower d.
dancegavindance,39thun,Tyler1851,3,Mon Jun 15 00:19:51 2015 UTC,"I sure fucking hope so.  If DGD go through clean vocalists like toilet paper, then they will be out of great replacements in no time. Besides, Tilian is kicking ass."
dancegavindance,39thun,lazenbooby,3,Sun Jun 14 21:45:12 2015 UTC,I just want to hear more 'Tides of Man' style vocals out of Tilian. Empire Theory and Dreamhouse both had amazing sound and lyrics.
dancegavindance,39thun,Deezzyy,2,Mon Jun 15 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Matt has often said that Tilian will be in the band for the rest of their careers. And honestly, this is the first time where they're actually stable. They've been teetering on the edge of breaking up all these years until now. I really don't want him to leave, and nobody in the band wants him to leave. Rise has them set to make a few more albums if I remember right. I'd say they have at least 2 more albums at the very least. But I think they'll be going until they get tired of constant touring. Then they'll go on hiatus. Then they'll come back in 2 - 3 years. Then they'll be done for good. Or they could be like the Chili Peppers and play for what seems like all eternity (please, God, let this be the case)."
dancegavindance,39thun,GalacticCatt,3,Mon Jun 15 01:48:28 2015 UTC,One guy in the thread said they're signed for only one more album with Rise
dancegavindance,39thun,GalacticCatt,2,Mon Jun 15 01:54:58 2015 UTC,"They'll sign another contract, I'm sure."
dancegavindance,39thun,SoloSun,3,Mon Jun 15 02:55:12 2015 UTC,Or possibly move to Blue Swan Records.
dancegavindance,39thun,Ibolieved,2,Mon Jun 15 03:55:48 2015 UTC,I really think it's not a good idea.  I love tillian..but this band is best when they change it up.
dancegavindance,39thun,TheMightyCaige,2,Mon Jun 15 06:24:01 2015 UTC,"No, obviously he will leave. The band will then bring in Kurt Travis because of how fun it will be to make a sequel to Death Star called Dance Gavin Dance 2."

dancegavindance,39rgac,ErdeTyrenne,6,Fri Jun 19 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I'm going to need you to elaborate on some parts. I'm quite confused.    Everybody shits on jonny and the reasons I keep on finding in those comments are all related to how Jonny is a bastard and how his bastardness really hurt their buttholes.  I'm okay with leaving jonny in the past while still appreciating his work, but bringing up jonny's name every 5 seconds to the ""hot"" page of this reddit just to talk shit isn't helping out the current band too much   Are you referring to the post of Jonny's Twitter earlier today? If you are, there was no trash talking in that post. Also, This subreddit honestly isn't that consistently active to where Johnny is brought to the ""Hot"" page of this sub. If you post something, it'll stay on ""Hot."" Also, everyone, even Johnny, agrees that he has been a douche. And it's a fact that he did hurt the bands image (I.e. The MacBook Scandal). I honestly feel like he's changed since then but it's more of like a pity of how is beautiful voice was lost from the band. Either way, most people enjoy Tilian as much. The band has a tendency to mold itself perfectly around vocalists and Tilian is amazingly talented. It's your own opinion if Johnny is better than Kurt or Tilian. Others would obviously disagree with that. Don't put it out as a fact.    So lets stop the DBM and Jonny trash-talking in every discussion about singers or albums, and just appreciate DBM and Jonny for what they created, an album that (like the rest) does not sound like any of their other albums.   Who trashes on DBM? and there are no threads dedicated to trash-talking Johnny. If I'm mistaken, please direct me to it. Also, this may be a personal opinion but no album sounds the same as the other and I believe other people in this sub can agree with me.    There are too many people begging for internet points on this subreddit nowadays while trying to seem stupidly oblivious, fuck that. Support the band, not your ego. If you like what Ive said, don't upvote, that's not what I'm here for, if you disagree, well let's find out how many people disagree.   Yes, this is true on Reddit overall but I don't see it here, on this subreddit, honestly. Once again, if I'm mistaken, please direct me.This is a ""self-post"" and you don't get karma for self-posts so people can upvote you if they agree."
dancegavindance,39rgac,HelloDepression,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:13:31 2015 UTC,"Back when we had the album ranking posts on the subreddit, plenty of people listed DBM I and II as their last albums with their reasoning being that Jonny was a terrible person so they discredited the music. With comments, ""i liked the songs but when I heard Jonny I hated them"" or ""I like DBM but it's second to last before DBMII because it makes me forget I hate Jonny as much."" Your comment about the albums sounding different; I talked about that in my post and I do agree with you, as you can see in my post.   All I'm saying is show some respect for what the band's past is, Will and Matt are still trucking along, but it is not the same band it was, which is a huge reason I like them so much due to their changes in musical influence and expression.   A lot of posts I read come up and support Tilian in a way that brings down Jonny, and I just think that's a shame man :/"

""We could've had it all had he kept his ish together"", but unfortunately his addiction caused a lot of conflicts within the band BOTH times he was apart of the group. Yes, he may be a different person now but history is history. The Kurt era is my favorite DGD, Tillian is doing a fantastic job with the band now and I wouldn't trade JC 07-now for either of their contributions, but DBM is my favorite album just for its epic sound to which JC is a huge part of. It all worked out for the best though. I feel like Jonny kinda plateaued/burned out after the emarosa self titled/dbm2 and we've been blessed with both Kurt (rip) and Tillian.  P.S. Jon Mess is God. P.S.S. Shouts out to Will and Matt for holding it down"

Personally, Tilian is my favorite vocalist that DGD has had (I've followed Tilian across every project he's been in so I'm a little biased) I do like the JC era and even the Kurt era, tho!"
dancegavindance,39mm4q,TheHighestHobo,5,Fri Jun 12 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"Because I personally feel like his soulful voice fits well with the jazzy style of the bad. Or maybe it's because he's the first vocalist I heard when I got introduced to the band..so I associate my original love for the band with him. Also I'm sorry but tillians voice is too high pitched for ME. I digged Kurt Travis as well.  It's like...when I started listening to underoath they had Arron, and when he left although they still sounded like the underoath I discovered something was missing that I originally loved.. And I kinda fell ""out of love"" with the band and into ""like"" with the band.   Some people are rude about it and say ""omg this band sucks without ""insert member that left"" but I'll just be honest, the bands might not such, they just FEEL different compared to what originally caught your ear about them."

dancegavindance,39mm4q,ImAlexNotJose,2,Sat Jun 13 23:30:02 2015 UTC,I'd agree if Happiness weren't one if my favorite DGD albums. Even without Jon Mess they pulled off a terrific sound
dancegavindance,39mm4q,Mikeyswitz,4,Sun Jun 14 05:00:18 2015 UTC,"The main thing for me is that Jonny is one of the few vocalist I'll listen to that doesn't need to layer his vocals with harmonies because of the presence his voice has. I love Tilian and Kurt, but both of them layer their vocals in almost every song, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but Johnny never had to, so that's why I dig his voice most. I love all of their vocalists though, just Johnny a little bit more."
dancegavindance,39mm4q,ImAlexNotJose,2,Sat Jun 13 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"I always assumed he didn't layer out of laziness/not knowing how to properly track a harmony. Idk my favorite thing about Kurt were his harmonies. It's kind of like saying Will is such a great player that he doesn't need to compliment his parts with a second guitar. sure, he could go that route, but the band loses something in the process."
dancegavindance,39mm4q,ImAlexNotJose,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"He's done it in some songs, but they're rarely ever both him singing the same thing. It might be him holding out a note over his own singing and I can get down with that. To me it's like, I don't know if 'd enjoy Tilian's time with DGD if he didn't layer his voice as much, because with his voice, it adds something, whereas with Jonny's I feel like it'd be overkill because of his vocal texture. Kurt's harmonies are a little weird, because he can layer it and add something, but there's no rasp like Tilian or Jonny, so when he layers his vocal's you get this groovy feel from them. It's kind of like how Will didn't need a second guitarist for DBM2 and most of IG because he was good enough to hold his own as both 1st and 2nd guitar."
dancegavindance,39mm4q,red-eyes-black-kevin,2,Sat Jun 13 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Eh I think you might be overselling it here. Also the equivalent would be Will tracking a single guitar part for a full song, not BOTH parts. And I don't think it'd have been overkill, that's like saying any vocalist with a comparable or raspy voice would be ill suited to track harmonies. I can think of a million counterexamples to that line of logic.  I'm pretty sure it comes down to Johnny being lazy/not thinking it's worth it. I'm pretty sure if someone were to isolate Johnny's vocals and melodyne them into a harmony, it would sound perfectly fine and detract nothing in the process."
dancegavindance,39mm4q,ImAlexNotJose,0,Sun Jun 14 00:19:15 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree man, because he's definitely done it,but he does it very sparsely. I'd say that Will's best writing is when he has 2 guitar parts, because that's how he writes, while someone like Jimmy Page  possibly doesn't even consider a second guitar, because that's not his style. I'm not sure, because with this album, he did some layering, even though it was very little, and to me, that was enough. I don't need to hear layering in every song from every DGD vocalist."

dancegavindance,39lumt,DavidR525,3,Fri Jun 12 17:38:17 2015 UTC,New Jon is much more of a refined scream. To get the new Jon sound trying mixing your scream with your cleans. Also do lots of breathing exercises because it's all about control
dancegavindance,39lumt,JoshuaGr33n,3,Fri Jun 12 17:48:38 2015 UTC,"Haha! Jon's scream is one of the ONLY screams I can do. I would kill for lows but I just can't do em. I can send you a song my band made last year where I sound like him if you want, or if you want general tips lemme know."

Someone commented that to scream like new Jon you need to work on singing cleans which is absolutely true.   I torrented Melissa Cross' Art of Screaming DVD and the vocal exercises and honest to god that's what helped me become a good screamer. This song you heard is from about 2 years ago so I've improved a lot since then.   Again, lows I haven't been able to do in years but mostly for lack of trying. But I can legit sing and scream at the same time now similar to what you hear Jon do at the end of Death of a Strawberry."

Mainly songs from their Self-Titled (i.e Caviar, Hot Water on Wool) or Happiness (Powder to the People). I enjoy slower songs to workout because it helps me think and focus easier basically.   But I sometimes just put it on shuffle and listen to whatever because it's just purely relaxing to me. Try, A Lot Like Birds and Circa Survive as well btw :)"

The song ""Nesting Dolls"" and the title track on the album really stand out as songs that just work their way into your soul and camp out. They'll leave you wanting more.  My main tip for listening to Circa is this: Pick an instrument to focus on for the whole album. Listen to the way that instrument is used to create a whole soundscape. They all work so well together as a band, I swear their heartbeats are in synch."

Besides that, I would say that you could discover or dwell deeper into bands that you aren't that familiar with. You could listen to these bands, see which ones you like and don't. If the experience is bad, then you can easily fix it because you're also seeing DGD live. If you enjoy some of the bands you discovered, then you still top it off with seeing DGD live."

dancegavindance,39eh0s,Vensuad,3,Thu Jun 11 17:58:26 2015 UTC,I think they played close to the end and had around a 40-45 minute set. The earlier bands did 30 minute sets I believe.

He had just beaten Lyme disease, Jonny was back and had given his word to be better for the whole group, so I think Mess was just running on all cylinders. Maybe he was trying to be extra creative (fairly so, my favorite Mess moments are on DBM2) and the timing just worked.

dancegavindance,388esa,coldjeanz,2,Tue Jun 2 22:44:25 2015 UTC,I have never heard this.  It's their earliest and least produced. To be fans they might agree to those of us who've been here since the beginning it's still amazing imo. I Rank It above one of their other albums if not 2.   It's an ep though not an album.

dancegavindance,38592f,Jabba_the_WHAAT,2,Tue Jun 2 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"Vocal Run is what they're called in singing, I think. Arpeggio probably works. Really dope either way"
dancegavindance,38592f,GalacticCatt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"In classical music, they would call that a mordent (going up by step from a note and back down to the starting note very rapidly), but he's not out of time. Those fast notes he's singing are 16th notes. So you could write it out like this. An Arpeggio is when you sing the notes of a chord one at a time, which he is not doing."

dancegavindance,37fwu4,C115551,3,Wed May 27 14:53:57 2015 UTC,"Upvoted because puns are my favorite things, but honestly, this is probably one of my least favorite lyrics on the new album. It really takes me out of the song. I stop listening and just go ""What? did he just say that? Really?"" I was bummed, since I'm assuming this is the last Strawberry Swisher song (It was Death of the Strawberry Swisher in liner notes, I think), and I loved Pt. 2 and Pt. 3 so much. My favorite songs of of their respective albums."
dancegavindance,37fwu4,NeoSeth,4,Wed May 27 20:06:00 2015 UTC,Really? It's the opposite for me. That makes the whole song in my opinion.
dancegavindance,37fwu4,anjjelikka,2,Wed May 27 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"It's just so... silly? I'm not sure what the word is. But it's not silly in a funny way for me, or cheesy in an endearing way, it's just silly and cheesy and it honestly kills the vibe of the song for me. Up until then I can kind of roll with it; I love the guitar intro, and the melody and lyrics before that are alright (Except for ""Made some mistakes, not so good with planning,"" that's pretty clunky), and I can kind of gel with what the theme of the song seems to be (Feeling the moment, forgeting stress and just being happy), but when he says ""sugar daddy"" I lose it. I don't like the song overall, so maybe if I did I could feel differently about the lyric, but when you're already not feeling it that lyric seals the deal imo."
dancegavindance,37fwu4,NeoSeth,2,Wed May 27 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"actually, I kind of agree with you there. I do feel as though most DGD lyrics have never been extremely intricate, however. ya know ? It's just sort of filler... so most of the time I try to look past the cheesey lines haha"
dancegavindance,37fwu4,notiesnoroots,2,Wed May 27 23:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to pretend Johnny or Kurt had consistent lines of lyrical genius- in fact, Johnny's lyrics were often redundant and re-used phrases, even on my favorite album (DBMII)- but they did seem to suit the song more. When I listen to Pounce Bounce, for example, Johnny's lyrics are ""Feel the room filling up with smoke. Billowing, billowing up, over the world. Rise above!"" or something similar for the pre-chorus. What does that even mean? But it SOUNDS awesome in execution, where he sings ""Rise above!"" over the explosive, epic chorus. The chorus itself makes no coherent sense either, but when he ends it with ""The pain of second place,"" I get chills. Or listen to how he sings ""Smooth out the streets"" in Blue Dream. I heard Johnny was just SUPER high the whole time he wrote those lyrics, which makes a TON of sense in retrospect.  Tillain has done this too; Strawberry Swisher Pt. 3 is possibly my all-time favorite DGD song. His lyrics are perfect for it (Although, that's one of the few DGD songs where all the lyrics seem to go together). It's great. I also like a lot of his lines in Something New, particularly for the pre-chorus. But in Death of a Strawberry, and many other songs on the album, his lyrics take me out of the song. It's hard to go into detail about it without rambling, as evidenced by the fact that I'm already rambling."

dancegavindance,37d44c,Delusions0fGrandeur,10,Wed May 27 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"Thats a toughy, since they kind of span different genres. Of Machines were influenced by DGD's post hardcore style. But, they only had one album and the their recent ""reunion"" was a failure.... i also recommend Lower Definition, We Are Not Friends Anymore, and any band signed to Blue Swan Records. Obviously any band that a lead singer of DGD has been in, pre and post DGD. My favorites are A Lot Like Birds, Tides of Man, Isles and Glaciers, and Emarosa. But Kurt and Jonny have been in ton of other bands that are worth checking out.  In terms of funk Zacky G took some with it to his new band Strawberry Girls.  Hope some of these are new names to you!"

dancegavindance,37d44c,Y_Machina,2,Wed May 27 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"Stolas sounds a ton like DGD in my opinion. Very similar prog/post-hardcore blend. /u/kage6613 mentioned them, but I wanted to highlight it since they immeidately struck me as being similar to DGD when I first heard them. Not sure this is the best song to represent that, but it's possibly my favorite by them so deal with it.  Also, Fall of Troy is another AMAZING prog rock band with some similar influences, as is The Sound of Animals Fighting. (That last song needs to be listened to all the way through; it changes form dramatically.)  If you're interested in progressive metal at all, Protest the Hero is an INCREDIBLE band that actually led me to DGD (Or WERE an incredible band... their first two albums stand head and shoulders above the rest imo...).  And finally, for a more post-hardcore approach, Underoath should be mentioned. Here's their single Writing on the Walls, and their album Lost in the Sound of Seperation is a masterpiece of post-hardcore, ambient metal, and deathcore fused together pretty seamlessly.  Hope this helps!"

IG and the DBMs are rotatable at points, Deathstar is at the bottom which is a damn shame.  I love Zoloft, Alex, and a couple others but there's too many songs I just don't click with and it brings the album down to the bottom.  Also, I really like Kurt as a vocalist but the style change that came with him didn't really tickle my fancy.

Tonally that record just sounds really organic and natural, especially the drum mix. I really enjoy what Tilian has brought to the band though, so his record naturally have to come next. The guitar work on Acceptance Speech is impeccable, though I'll always be frustrated with the bass being close to nonexistant. I Love so many of the songs off of Instant Gratification, but some of the awkward Tilian parts kind of throw me off. I Loved Kurt in the band as well, so Happiness and Deathstar both rank right next to each other. Unfortunately, I haven't really been been able to get into much of DBM or WISIRO, but DBM has started to grow on me.  I would rather rank it  1. DMB2/Acceptance Speech 2.

""I copped that blow torch off your front porch"" - Not sure, but if I had to guess, it has something to do with a flame. Again about a girl.   I can't put it into words because I am incredibly tired, but I think Eagle vs. Crows is about a good guy vs. bad guys. The Eagle being the hero (because of what it stands for, patriotism, freedom, etc) and the Crow being the villain (because Crows stand for death)  idk, I'm tired, I love this sub"
dancegavindance,36vvhd,TheMightyCaige,1 point,Sat May 23 08:17:38 2015 UTC,"That's my interpretation of Eagles vs. Crows too. I think of it as comparing good guys vs. bad guys in relationships. The lyrics are supposed to be a parody of the ""modern man, modern plan,"" which is an uncaring, shallow, self-centered party animal type of person (Doing cocaine off of a girl's breasts on her birthday and her aunt's funeral, not wanting to have any complaints when she comes home and he's high, ""don't wait up for me,"" etc.). This is what the ""crows"" stand for, and it's a bit of a commentary on trends in our current culture. Then the Eagles are the ""good guys,"" despite not being represented in the lyrics as far as I can tell."
dancegavindance,36vvhd,NeoSeth,1 point,Wed May 27 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"I think we're pretty spot on.   I was just listening to this song, and I feel like the title 'Eagle vs. Crows' might be a way of saying that there are more bad people than there are good people."
dancegavindance,36vvhd,TheMightyCaige,1 point,Wed May 27 21:57:05 2015 UTC,Actually the title has nothing to do with the song. Will Swan named it after seeing a literal fight between an eagle and some crows.

dancegavindance,36bqoc,Koldsaur,2,Mon May 18 06:14:46 2015 UTC,Jon has always had trouble performing live though. I personally think it's a combination of his fast/overlapping lines and his medical condition. Could be drugs though lol.
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Suit-and-Tie,2,Tue May 19 21:28:51 2015 UTC,Interesting. What medical condition BTW?
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Koldsaur,3,Wed May 20 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"He had Lyme disease. I thought I read that it was gone now, but maybe not."
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Suit-and-Tie,3,Wed May 20 07:42:18 2015 UTC,"But that shouldn't affect his singing? I looked it up and got this  ""Lyme disease causes a rash, often in a bull's-eye pattern, and flu-like symptoms. Joint pain and weakness in the limbs also can occur."""
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Koldsaur,2,Wed May 20 09:36:16 2015 UTC,"You're right. Just looked up a few old interviews and the Lyme disease is always mentioned alongside his poor vocal technique, so I wrongly associated the two with each other.  Could you talk a little bit about why you left DGD after deathstar was recorded? Was it all because of the lyme disease?    I left for a number of reasons. Jonny was no longer in the band and I thought that meant we were fighting an uphill battle now trying to keep the fanbase and then continue to grow. I didn’t like touring at the time and I was also sick with Lyme and getting constant sinus infections, my screaming technique was too harsh on my voice and I was struggling live and in the studio to maintain. I felt like I needed to finish school and if I was going to pursue vocals I needed lessons and practice, so I got them, practiced, and improved.   The band continued without me and things went well for them, better than I expected, then I was asked to come on a tour during the summer in between semesters and from there I finished school while doing the band at the same time"
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Suit-and-Tie,2,Wed May 20 18:01:18 2015 UTC,"Huh I wonder if he is referencing that in On The Run: ""So I practiced, adapted, and it felt great"""

I think he might be dyslexic, or its just REALLY painful for him to scream all the time like that. They are most likely going to start changing the sound of his scream when he gets a little older like all the other post hardcore bands. (Asking Alexandria, Alesana,  The devil wears Prada, etc.)"
dancegavindance,36bqoc,Koldsaur,2,Wed May 20 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"His screams are A LOT different than most bands in this genre. I talked to him about it and he said it's way more projection than other screaming, and that it involves a lot of breathing practice."
dancegavindance,36bqoc,dustycat21,1 point,Thu May 21 15:54:01 2015 UTC,it's also the way I scream. I had no idea it was special
dancegavindance,36bqoc,FlyingFuckasaur,1 point,Mon May 25 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Thats a huge downplay of Lymes  because a lot of the cases get treated early and you dont develop some of the more serious symptoms.   If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness, or heart palpitations, among others. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, people develop shooting pains or tingling in their arms and legs. Despite appropriate treatment, about 10 to 20% of people also develop joint pains, have problems with memory, and feel tired much of the time  Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease is often complicated by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new ""great imitator"".Lyme disease may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, Crohn's disease, HIV, or other autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases."

As I told all of the MN reps I had spoken with: it was a terrible first time use experience, and I will not be using their services again.  I know it hardly matters to them, but I wanted them to really understand that even though I'm probably not their first ""first time customer"", but if this happens ""a lot"" like all of the representatives said, it honestly looks bad on them, and their manufacturers, producers, and partnered label companies. I'm sure me and plenty other people using their services for the first time, any time, have been/are/will be upset with how they get things done.

dancegavindance,35d7kl,chevello,5,Sat May 9 04:32:36 2015 UTC,"You're not an idiot. For starters, yea the mixing was off. Me and some friends spoke to Clay, the band that went on right before and when they set levels, they were all off, too loud. Dude thought they sounded bad but I genuinely enjoyed it and probably due to my distance by the time they got on stage it sounded alright. Now on DGD... Each band touring deserves the time they allot. Just because a band is headlining doesn't mean other bands will get cut short. This was actually quite a lengthy DGD set list (this is also my 7th time seeing them so maybe I'm just jaded).   In terms of them being yes men... They are human eye re tired and it's actually really nice they stick around after shows and speak to people. We can't take it personally when band members are tired. Like tillian is really good at being nice I gotta give it to him. I saw he wanted to go back stage and every time he left some one stopped him. They don't have to come out and talk to us- none of them do but it's really cool they do.   That said, I enjoy DGD. But I've met almost all of them and that's that. They are nice but idk if I toured every night I'd be a bit tired too so don't be too bummed, every time I've seen them since 2009, they've been cool.   Sidenote- i was kind of surprised about the crowd reaction to Stolas and HTS. Thought more people dug them. They are nice dudes too. Same for Hail the Sun but I say that even more so  cuz they actually ate with us after so that was super fucking cool of them. I find that the past 3 times I've seen them they talk more on a personal level at least to fans."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,iamcarlbarker,2,Sat May 9 05:42:39 2015 UTC,"I went to the Philly show, and I saw at least Half the crowd singing along. Sure it was a bit slow at first, but by the time they got to Ow splidao, the crowd was so into it that Donovan crowd surfed during the solo"
dancegavindance,35d7kl,VintagePain,3,Sat May 9 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds very interesting. The venue matters definitely and that does affect the atmosphere most of the time. What were the first two opening bands out of curiosity? Well, I honestly feel like one reason they may not have been into was because it was the end of their tour. Most bands get tired after a while and try to keep the same tempo, enthusiasm, etc. but it's hard to accomplish that consistently. I'm sorry to hear you had this off experience though. You can try and address it on Twitter to the band to see if something was up.   I know they didn't mean to give that kind of vibe but maybe they were just having their own off-night."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,HelloDepression,3,Sat May 9 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"And sorry for the double post but they released 4 songs off the album before hand so of course those would be on the set. The encore is pre planned essentially. And honestly with their back catalogue, this is a diverse set. They have a lot they can appeal too without sounding tired. Also while I don't doubt they will play Variation ONE day, that is a hard song to pull off live simply because of the range. If homie had to hit hat F#5 (or whatever it is) every night on tour unless he had a flawless ritual, he'd fatigue fast. I mean beggars can't be choosers. They played a lot of new songs and still did a good assortment of other ones.   Also, about bottom lounge... after going there for so many years... Never buy water there. Drink up before you get there, maybe even ask the crew for some (some hand it out with no problem, one of the guys gave me 2 for me and my fiends).  Something I'll seriously give this band. They can put up with a lot. You can only please so many people. Even in interviews hey acknowledge it. So they do what they want. They'll try to please fans but at the same time we can't expect them to service us and our every request. Next time you see them, I guarantee you it'll be different. Especially if it isn't at bottom lounge. I think shows for this band (and bands like these in general) are better for those seeking interpersonal moments at places outside of Chicago where it's harder to get too at smaller places. It sounds shitty to say but it filters the crowd and changes the environment."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,iamcarlbarker,3,Sat May 9 05:54:23 2015 UTC,"I agree on the diverse set. I'd imagine with Tilian in his 3rd year of being a member, he would want to sing more of his songs. And DGD as musicians would probably regard their newest material as their favorite material so it would likely be unanimous to fit the set like this. 4 IG songs / 4 AS songs / 2 Jonny / 2 Kurt."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,rickman4L,3,Sat May 9 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"I've been to a ton of shows, bands never really change their setlist on tour. Or at least nobody I have ever seen does. They practice what they are gonna play live to get it down before the tour so it's kind of unrealistic to expect them to just start playing whatever the crowd wants to be played. As for Mess he has never been one of those super hype guys on stage. He just about always delivers the same quality live that he does on albums so that's cool with me. I doubt Variation will ever be played live. That song would take a shit ton of energy out of Tilian."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,cha0ss0ldier,3,Sat May 9 16:20:28 2015 UTC,I don't think the bottom lounge is really in a sketchy area but whatever. I enjoyed the show the sound was off but other than that i had a good time i do wish they played more off IG but i realize something like say variation is probably not easy to pull off that well live for tilian. I thought they were pretty into it for the most part they didn't joke around as much between songs like they did when they came through last year but you could tell they were fatigued. Overall decent show but enjoyed the acceptance speech tour stop from last year way more.
dancegavindance,35d7kl,hustlebnes,2,Sun May 10 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"Had a similar situation in Abq, barley any people there for Dance but a entire sea of kids for Crown the Empire, so maybe that effected it, but they played the basic set list you could see online. Then after they played me and my bud met them outside, and always imagined something magical but instead Matt was being a yes man, Tilian almost walked right past us when asked for a picture. Jon was kinda a yes man too, but at least had a decent convo with us. Dgd is my favourite band so was a little disappointed but fuck still got to mosh to uneasy hearts so cross that off the bucket list."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,indulgeme82,3,Sat May 9 05:25:07 2015 UTC,Same thing when I saw them on the Take Action Tour. Crowd was dead as shit for DGD. I saw them on the IG tour in Orlando and the crowd was amazing though.
dancegavindance,35d7kl,cha0ss0ldier,2,Sat May 9 16:21:47 2015 UTC,"On DGD headliners, they are always allotted an hour long set. For the $15-20 ticket price, that's about right. The rest of the lineup made the ticket it worth it to me. Unimpressive local opener, but Stolas, Hail The Sun and Polyphia delivered. This was my 10th time seeing DGD. Probably the 3rd time at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago and I have to say it may have been the best I've heard them sound, at least in a long time. Their stage presence is fine imo, based on the difficulty/precision of the material they are playing. They supported the new album by playing 4 songs from it, so 1/3rd of the set was new material.   One thing I will agree on is that since Tilian joined, I have seen them 6 times with Tilian, and they played about 3 different setlists through that more or less. Which means they played set 1 on 2 tours, set 2 on 2 tours and set 3 on tours, give or take a couple songs due to Acceptance Speech and Instant Gratification coming out. Saw them 3 times with Jonny and they only played DBM or DBM2 songs, not even Royal Ocean, but all 3 sets I saw with Jonny were very different. Saw them once with Kurt so that was a different set.  It definitely was hot at the Bottom Lounge show this week though, and I had the bright idea of wearing a hoodie in the pit, haha. Glad I didn't pass out. Definitely not the most memorable set, but one of the best sounding I've heard from them."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,rickman4L,2,Sat May 9 06:04:44 2015 UTC,"That basically happened when they came to Fort Lauderdale,  the guitars and bass over powered the vocals , tilan literally walked off the stage before their very last song finished. Just dropped the mic and left kinda douchy.  The crowd was really into it so was I but still they looked like they didn't really care :("
dancegavindance,35d7kl,lightkira15,2,Sat May 9 06:30:41 2015 UTC,"If the venue's called 'the Bottom Lounge', what did you expect? Also if YOU found it hot, imagine what the band felt like under the direct glare of the lights and actually having to do something for an hour.  It's also worth noting that the current line-up almost certainly doesn't know how to play every song live, so expecting them to just start playing whatever people are shouting for is unrealistic.  Bad mixes/sound happens at shows, from the smallest clubs to the biggest arenas, just sometimes goes that way. Not really fair to blame the band for that.  And, for what it's worth, DGD have never been known to be an energetic live act in terms of stage presence, it's just not their thing."
dancegavindance,35d7kl,curryleaf,1 point,Sat May 9 06:34:57 2015 UTC,"I drove 4 hours from Indiana for that show, and let me tell you, it was amazing. First off, the Bottom Lounge is a great venue.

I do think Tilians vocals could have used a bit of live automation, but thats not the end of the world. As for the crowd, Chicago gets down! So much more energetic than what I find here. The other bands were great. The local band was really impressive for a local band. I think Polyphia was just what that tour needed too. A bit of a break from the constant vibes that are created by the other bands that are quite similar. As for DGD, their setlist is predetermined. Of course they're not going to do a new set every night. No band does that. In terms of energy, I think they were great they all are very passionate musicians that put their all into this, and that really shines through: at least it did for me. And I honestly loved that the went on at 8. It was a Tuesday night, and I had to be back on my campus 4-4.5 hours away for a final the next day. Solid thinking on the part of the venue to not have a late concert on a weekday. Overall, 10/10 would do again"

dancegavindance,34x6jy,bolievethrice,2,Tue May 5 13:12:45 2015 UTC,Definitely not as easy to get into as their other albums but I love it. At times it has been my favorite DGD album just from the rawness and emotion you can feel in it.

dancegavindance,34omgb,dontlookbackcarl,20,Sun May 3 02:39:04 2015 UTC,He's said before that sometimes they have meaning and sometimes they don't. What I've heard is that he writes his lyrics based on the the song itself. So sometimes it is just a bunch of words that mesh well with the tune of the music. It's a pretty unique approach and he comes up with some really cool stuff IMO.
dancegavindance,34omgb,mfish139,9,Sun May 3 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"He really does. One of my favorite that I could never make sense of was ""I COPPED THAT BLOW TORCH OFF YOUR FRONT PORCH!"""
dancegavindance,34omgb,etherealnova,7,Sun May 3 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense. My favorite line by Jon right now is,  ""Proxy the awesome and seek the deletion of reaper repeating submission face, Opt for the option to stop this exhaustion and breathe through the tube of civility""  You can try to make sense of it and try to find meaning but in the end it just sounds amazing and perfectly flows with the rest of the song."

Fuck that, pick yourself up and face your problems, because in the end, only you can.' ""The end is the end is the end is the end of days"" 'there's no coming back from that final solution'  S'how I interpreted it anyway. Would be interested in hearing another point of view."
dancegavindance,34omgb,VintagePain,2,Sun May 3 13:54:41 2015 UTC,"lol. That's a starcraft reference. Jon is a huge sc2 player (he's a diamond player iirc), and this is referring to a common strategy of winning early by building a barracks close to the enemy base (proxying) in order to build units to quickly overrun the enemy. This is to seek the deletion of their stuff, so you say ""gg"" (being civil in the face of a loss), and the enemy repeatedly loses and has to surrender. Something tells me that Jon's getting a little fed up with the proxy reaper screwing up his games.  Or, he's able to hold off the proxies reaper, and the opponent is the one who surrenders"

dancegavindance,34omgb,indulgeme82,4,Sun May 3 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"I always think it's strange that Jon Mess gets criticised for his lyrics seeming meaningless, when I find his lyrics relatively easy to interpret and a big part of why I enjoy the band is Jon Mess's poetic flair. Oddly it was Jonny's lyrics I always found the most difficult to interpret, because to me they're often either nonsensical or incredibly vague. That being said, there are some songs where I don't have a clue what Jon's getting at. Running themes I've noticed in his lyrics are difficulty consolidating the feeling of society's imposition on men to appear stoic and manly with the desire for romance and emotional connection, a feeling of abandonment from the lack of existence of a god, dealing with depression, what it's like screaming in a band and how awesome jerking off is. And yeah, there's a bunch of gibberish too."
dancegavindance,34omgb,The_iron_lung,3,Sun May 3 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it in On the Run, from those specific lyrics, is if you messed up going in raw with a chick you're gonna have the decision to go down the rode of raising your mistake or abortion. The song title represents metaphorically running from or avoiding the decision. ""Well I practiced adapted, and it felt great"" is that you stopped running from your problems, faced them, and it feels great that you're becoming you're own hero everyone else strives so hard to become."
dancegavindance,34omgb,bewareofdware,3,Sun May 3 05:36:56 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, On The Run might have just become my favorite song on the record. Before that it was The Cuddler."

She doesnt post any dgd or tides of man, or solo stuff about Tilian with comments like ""this is my sons music"" or something to that extent.  apparently she has a daughter? most likely an adult daughter.

dancegavindance,34ipro,km509,1 point,Fri May 1 23:16:22 2015 UTC,i believe they're alternating stages so that as soon as one band stops playing on the main stage another band will immediately start playing on the other

dancegavindance,34fzmo,HelloDepression,1 point,Fri May 1 04:06:10 2015 UTC,Maybe after dgd8 they'll release an even crazier set. But for real what's taking Rise so long for Deathstar

Also quick question: Do you happen to have the misprinted Acceptance Speech or Instant Gratification? I got Acceptance speech and my vinyl of Instant Gratification has the lyrics misprint"
dancegavindance,34ehxm,RememberTheTightOnes,6,Thu Apr 30 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"It's alright dude. I can understand the guilt but pretty much the album is clearly amazing. For some songs, I can't connect them to the albums you listed because they have elements of new things I haven't heard before. But I guess that's what makes it even more amazing, it offers a variety of a nostalgic effect through new experiences from previous albums."
dancegavindance,34ehxm,HelloDepression,3,Thu Apr 30 15:28:46 2015 UTC,For sure it's different for everyone. These are just my personal observations based on my past listening experiences.

If it's not, it gives me new insight and ways to think about the album, adding to the complexity and overall value to the CD(IMO). thank you for sharing!"
dancegavindance,34ehxm,bscotth,3,Thu Apr 30 19:06:52 2015 UTC,Completely agree regarding Death of a Strawberry. The chorus always blows me away.
dancegavindance,34ehxm,Jordan311R,3,Thu Apr 30 17:28:43 2015 UTC,"I really thought I liked Acceptance Speech a ton until I heard Instant Gratification. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Acceptance Speech but now after listening to this new album tons, I went back and listened to Acceptance Speech again and it's just a small hint of the potential of this line-up and does really sound thin compared to Instant Gratification. I agree that this may be their best work yet."
dancegavindance,34ehxm,TheMightyCaige,2,Thu Apr 30 22:59:48 2015 UTC,"I feel so bad, because I love Deathstar so much. Dance Gavin Dance from 2008 with Kurt and Jon is my favorite incarnation of the band ever, and I feel guilty for loving Instant Gratification so much, because it reminds me a lot of those days. Tillian and Jon complement each other very well.   I was so bummed when Kurt left and was replaced by Jonny and didn't really care too much for Tillian until this album was released. Now I'm kind of nervous about getting attached to this version of the band because of course someone will leave again.   TL;DR - I feel bad for loving IG so much because I geek out every time I listen to Death Star."

Awkward and Biblee (off secret band's full length) both feature Zach on guitar and they are two great songs; Will and Zach are an awesome combination. Bring back Zach.   Also maybe a little Eric Lodge on bass.

Also it's weird, Will flipped sides from when I saw them a few weeks ago, although admittedly that show took place in a hail storm and the outdoor stage's roof was leaking, so maybe they had to adjust the stage plot for that.

dancegavindance,34cdd7,Keep_on_keepin,4,Thu Apr 30 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping that Tillian sounds more like how he does with Tides of Man. I also want the next album to be more experimental and progressive. I like Instant Gratificaiton, but some of the guitar parts seemed very streamlined to accommodate Tillian's pop style. I want more DBM II/ DBM styled riffs.   We need Matt Geise back for another song. Maybe get Cory Lockwood for screaming? Speaking of Lockwood, Jon Mess needs some more meaningful lyrics- but maybe I just love A Lot Like Birds too much so I'm little biased on this."
dancegavindance,34cdd7,esanch,3,Thu Apr 30 01:51:15 2015 UTC,I hear bits and pieces of Tillian's tides of man days but not the entire length. And for an album thatd be an amazing to see the harshness between him and jon mess. Just to spice things up.  You have some good ideas. specially the dbm style guitar riffs!  I never thought of cory lockwood when I posted this but your right. thatd be seriously epic to hear him and jon going back and forth between their diff vocal styles.
dancegavindance,34cdd7,DavidR525,3,Thu Apr 30 02:28:55 2015 UTC,My god.... I've never thought of Cory Lockwood featuring on a dgd song.... That would be amazing. Cory's such an amazing lyricist. My favorite for sure.
dancegavindance,34cdd7,JSBUCK,3,Thu Apr 30 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"A darker tone in the music, more Tides of Man influence, and more screams from Tilian"
dancegavindance,34cdd7,Keep_on_keepin,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:41:13 2015 UTC,great ideas! have you heard the song supercow Featuring Tilian pearson?  Imagine hearing those tilian pearson parts (especially the screams/ harsh vocals towards the end of the track) on a DGD album.  my mind would explode. seriously check that song out. I think its an old Emarosa demo

dancegavindance,34cdd7,Y_Machina,7,Thu Apr 30 02:04:20 2015 UTC,Id honestly like to see more of a battle as displayed on DBM 1.  Your referring to singing/ screaming simultaneously or what I said?
dancegavindance,34cdd7,Y_Machina,5,Thu Apr 30 02:07:56 2015 UTC,Kinda like more backwards pumpkin types of a chorus.

dancegavindance,34cdd7,SPAGHETTI_CAKE,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:40:25 2015 UTC,I always wondered what happened to nic. What band is Thomas Dutton from?  Cory would be an amazing guest vocalist. Just imagine a fun battle or contrast between Jon mess lyrics and Cory's spoken word/ scream vocals. :0
dancegavindance,34cdd7,SPAGHETTI_CAKE,2,Thu Apr 30 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"Thomas Dutton was from a band called Forgive Durden, and they were amazing, their only full length-album with the whole band is called Wonderland.   I would love to hear Cory and Mess together. When I first heard A Lot Like Birds I thought it was Mess."
dancegavindance,34cdd7,SwayzeSolidus,4,Thu Apr 30 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"I would like to hear them play heavier with a bit more edge, like the Deathstar album. I loved the contrast that the vocals had. But regarding number six if they were to do anything they would probably only do one song. That being said if they did release that one song the world would be a better place. hunger? GONE, poverty? GONE, crime? corruption? greed? GONE GONE and GONE. Everyone would be in a constant state of hakuna matata. Forever."
dancegavindance,34cdd7,BrianTheBean,2,Thu Apr 30 11:12:37 2015 UTC,The deathstar idea sounds interesting. Would you want a Deathstar Pt 2? or just an album with heavier playing guitar wise and sonically?  Id love to see naysayers co-sign tillian and DGD after featuring johnny/kurt on a track. I love the sound of Hakuna Matata between DGD fans :) so beautiful and tragic!

Always hated the ""hush now don't you cry"", seemed a little too Mickey Mouse-ish, even for Tilian"
dancegavindance,34bwal,wildcard6270,5,Thu Apr 30 08:15:13 2015 UTC,"Would have to agree with you on Skyhook. As far as less favorite album, I'd say Whatever I say is Royal Ocean. Not because I don't like the songs but because of low production it sounds imo. Would be amazing to see remastered"
dancegavindance,34bwal,samhoe,5,Wed Apr 29 23:32:35 2015 UTC,"I love the ""Shimmy shimmy my way down underground"" bit of that song"
dancegavindance,34bwal,wildcard6270,4,Thu Apr 30 08:20:06 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't say any song is bad because each song caters to a different person. To elaborate, each DGD song is made in a special way of creativity that some may adore and others don't. It could connect to someone lyrically, instrumentation-wise, etc. Some people love ""I'm Down With Brown Town"" because of it's Bass. This is why I believe that some people happen to be in favor of an album or song one week and then favor another song or album the next. Our mind may want to here something specific that DGD offers and every song caters to a specific need that we may have during that certain period."
dancegavindance,34bwal,HelloDepression,2,Thu Apr 30 06:01:35 2015 UTC,"I also don't think DGD has a worst song, but there are those that aren't going to be the ones I suggest to people getting into the band. They'd probably be SSPT3, most songs from WISRO, and reprogramming mental programming"

dancegavindance,34bwal,rickman4L,3,Tue May 5 17:59:32 2015 UTC,"12 Hours, 630 Miles and Blue Dream are probably my least favorite songs by DGD. If I had a least favorite release, I'd say Royal Ocean."
dancegavindance,34bwal,rickman4L,2,Thu Apr 30 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 12 Hours, 630 Miles is kind of weird. It's completely different than anything on DBM and it's not a song you would blast on repeat. Would like to hear it live though."
dancegavindance,34bwal,Captain_Scarblade,3,Thu Apr 30 00:35:30 2015 UTC,"I'd rather hear all the DGD songs live before 12 Hours, 630 Miles. By far, my most skipped song."
dancegavindance,34bwal,Captain_Scarblade,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:17:05 2015 UTC,"To me: DGD doesn't have a ""worst"" of anything.  If I had to choose a lackluster or least played song its either 12 hours 630 miles or tidal waves: breakfast lunch and dinner.  I like all the albums but the one that puts me to sleep is that Whatever I say is royal ocean. I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing lol but the last time I introduced my brothers to DGD was through the ep and we all dozed off to sleep lol"
dancegavindance,34bwal,ayo235,3,Thu Apr 30 00:27:50 2015 UTC,For the longest time I avoided their EP. Then I heard The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 2 and I LOVED THE EP. But I do agree with you on Tidal Waves.   The Robot Vs. Heroin Battle of Vietnam gets me pumped up tho.
dancegavindance,34bwal,Delusions0fGrandeur,2,Thu Apr 30 00:38:25 2015 UTC,"As much as I wanted DGD to be a chronological listening experience with my brothers, I don't know how I can get through it without breaking it down. Don't get me wrong its great and all but listening to tracks in a row is weary.  The robot songs on that ep are amazing! Personal favorite off that ep is Robot with human hair part 2"

dancegavindance,3402qt,kspwch,11,Mon Apr 27 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"This is a comment I left in /r/posthardcore for a similar question:    You, my friend, have come to the right man.  There are 3 'types' of Dance Gavin Dance, as each singer sounds completely different. I love all 3 equally, but what I'm saying is that if you don't like one album, you may still love the others.  Jonny Craig   Possibly one of the best singers in the genre, but he is a dick. DGD with Jonny had a kind of soul sound, which complemented Jon's harsh vocals fantastically.    And I told them... Pounce Bounce Heat Seeking Ghost Of Sex   Kurt Travis  His voice isn't quite as 'unique' as Jonny's, but he is still a beautiful sounding man. They sounded less bouncy with Kurt, but his songs were ideal for singing along to, with catchy choruses. Some songs even sounded kinda Jazz-like (Don't Tell Dave, see below)   Uneasy Hearts Weigh The Most Tree Village Don't Tell Dave   Tilian Pearson  The current singer for DGD - he's more high pitched than the other vocalists but sounds just as awesome, if not better. Like Kurt, he's great to sing along to, holding long notes perfectly. Any of the new stuff you've heard will be Tilian singing.   Jesus H Macy Strawberry Swisher Part 3 New single On The Run   So yeah, give each singer a chance as the band sounds different with each. But they all sound incredible."
dancegavindance,3402qt,lazenbooby,2,Mon Apr 27 08:09:50 2015 UTC,"even if you go by singer then you still have a huge variation.  jonny WISIRO  is hugely different then jonny DBMII.  I also personally dislike deathstar but i also love happiness and both are kurt, and i know a few people with the opposite opinion.  it all depends on personal taste.   However I should say this,  most people on here started with downtown battle mountain.  In 2007 it was such a welcomed change to the whole posthardcore scene, and everyone seems to universally love it.  It encompasses the bands epicness.    but ill also analyze the individual albums.    WISIRO: super distant sounding, and beautiful in a way,  like most genesis albums its raw, but i think it sounds awesome like that.  i also love jon's vocals in this one.  id say this album gets over looked way to often and it's amazing.  DBM:  like i said above this album is what i believe to be the game changer album.  will swan became a bit more bouncy in his guitar,  jon and jonny's voices started becoming a dichotomy.  I think that dichotomy between jon and jonny's voice is what made it so epic.  Deathstar:  as i said before im not a huge fan of this album so i feel like id be doing it a disservice to talk about it,  someone else feel free to discuss it.  i will say the lyrics in this album is amazing though  Happiness:  A ton of people love happiness.  i think the flow between kurt and wills guitar is amazing,  i think this is because kurt can hold those notes so fucking well.  also id say that album is super groovy.  DBM II:  this album is super fun and groovy,  but also still epic because it's the return of the jon jonny duo,  mixed with the new groovy style of will and matt.  Acceptance speech:  kind of reminds me of happiness.  except now with tillian who is also a phenomenal singer and im super happy he took over singing for dgd.  his voice is smooth like sweet sweet butter.  also quite a lot more effects in this album  Instant gratification:  only been out for a few weeks and i havnt heard it enough to give it a full synopsis,  but i will say i think its a strong album, and it seems to be very well recieved,  i think tillian really came out of his shell"
dancegavindance,3402qt,aadams9900,7,Mon Apr 27 22:49:28 2015 UTC,I think you should just listen to them all in chronological order and see how the band progresses over time. Starting with Whatever I Say Is Royal Ocean.
dancegavindance,3402qt,RoyalOcean,4,Mon Apr 27 13:23:38 2015 UTC,Start from the beginning.  I wish I had....I started at death Starr and no complaints.
dancegavindance,3402qt,bolievethrice,2,Mon Apr 27 06:38:43 2015 UTC,"I envy you so much.   It would be easier to say which album you should start with if I knew what music you were into, but generally I think Downtown Battle Mountain 1 is the best start because that's what I started with. However I feel Happiness and Instant Gratification are the most accessible."
dancegavindance,3402qt,Husky127,1 point,Mon Apr 27 06:57:33 2015 UTC,Start with Downtown Battle Mountain
dancegavindance,3402qt,robiannelli,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Im gonna nerd the fuck out.  They have changed so much over the years.  I'd say start with the singles off of Downtown Battle Mountain 2, and their self titled. Here are a few  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Saru77wiYJY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ZsV3Fzzoo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy-fwC5sjQI  Watch some related videos from each album to get a feel  DBM2 and self titled (deathstar) are their weakest albums as a whole imo, but have some of their best songs on each.  If you're really sad and melancholic, or a teenager in general, check out happiness. Its one of their strongest albums imo, and has a really jazzy emo pop punk vibe to it.  If you don't want too much melodrama, or you are digging on something really ""unique"" or technical sounding, check out acceptance speech. I'd say it's their best album, and a lot of people who dislike their older work swear by this album.  If you want something atmospheric and super super dramatic, check out whatever I say is royal ocean or downtown battle mountain. I personally say DBM is the album ive enjoyed the least, yet I absolutely love WISIRO because of how raw it feels.  Listen to their new album last. I really like their new album, but I think it gives a really inaccurate first impression of the band, and removed from the context of the rest of their discography, the metalcore breakdowns might seem kind of cliche.  here's something from wisiro and its grungy hyperdrama https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaFqtB00tI  One of the most creative and unique tracks the band has ever put out from acceptence speech, with some of the most tasteful use of autotune I have ever heard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVLUOKwR5mU  And for shits and giggles, here's everybody's favorite track from their new album, which has much more pop influence in the production and song structure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP7XBZoHMk4"

dancegavindance,33x2sn,njme1,2,Sun Apr 26 14:14:09 2015 UTC,"Doors open at 5:30, so I would say maybe 4:45-5:00 if you wanna be close to the band."
dancegavindance,33x2sn,demonsforryu,2,Sun Apr 26 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"I'll be there. Driving up from Chesapeake and my buddies ex wife is being a bitch, so we likely won't get to our hotel until close to 5 or 6.   Such a fucking drag."
dancegavindance,33x2sn,demonsforryu,1 point,Sun Apr 26 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Well at least the only thing you'd be missing is maybe the first opening band, so there's that! Still sucks though man, hope it works out."
dancegavindance,33x2sn,nograsswillgrow,2,Sun Apr 26 16:20:52 2015 UTC,We just got to Springfield. Gonna check in the hotel and rock an uber up there.
dancegavindance,33x2sn,trickscopes,2,Sun Apr 26 22:10:54 2015 UTC,My girlfriend and I are driving from NC. About 4 hours away. Probably getting there by 7:30. Don't really mind missing the local bands.
dancegavindance,33x2sn,nograsswillgrow,3,Sun Apr 26 18:26:14 2015 UTC,do you think the openers will really take that long?
dancegavindance,33x2sn,demonsforryu,2,Sun Apr 26 19:37:33 2015 UTC,Probably at least the first hour. Don't mind missing Polyphia either.
dancegavindance,33x2sn,nograsswillgrow,3,Sun Apr 26 19:54:55 2015 UTC,Polyphia isn't here. Stolas and then HTS.
dancegavindance,33x2sn,demonsforryu,2,Sun Apr 26 23:46:18 2015 UTC,We're stuck in horrible traffic. Still have 45 minutes till we get there. Sigh. Really wanted to see Hail the Sun.
dancegavindance,33x2sn,nograsswillgrow,3,Sun Apr 26 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"Stolas is playing their last song right now, 8:25. You'll make it.  Good luck!    Traffic sucks. Took us 4.5 hours from Chesapeake (should have been 3)."

dancegavindance,33w15x,Philosoaxolotl,6,Sun Apr 26 04:13:55 2015 UTC,"I think that is what it is. And another thing - ""The grass is green inside my yard"" meaning the grass is always greener on the other side.   I think what happens is that they both love her, and then she dies and now neither of them know what happened, but continue loving her...which would explain why the song doesn't end after Mess' verse and instead continues on with another chorus"
dancegavindance,33w15x,TheMightyCaige,5,Sun Apr 26 08:24:23 2015 UTC,Another fan once said he felt Jon's character was a crazy drunk man who happened to witness the girl die.   That improved the song for me. Makes me laugh every time I think about it.   I think you've got it figured out.
dancegavindance,33w15x,BadFish19,4,Sun Apr 26 16:44:38 2015 UTC,"Your bitch is dead, she was hit by a truck! WHATTHEFUCK  I think that the song is about a dude who is so in love with this girl that he starts to do that whole ""imagining life"" thing. However the guy is obviously a little fucked up since he dreamed about lying to her future children instead of making them eggs or something. Anyway I figure once the girl was dating someone else, he killed her with a truck. The last line in the song is kind of eerie when you look at it from that perspective.  ""Yeah, I heard you like her...""  Edited to change eery to eerie."
dancegavindance,33w15x,RelativeMinors,2,Sun Apr 26 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you nailed it. Great song"
dancegavindance,33w15x,AhTreyYou,2,Sun Apr 26 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"I love this song man. Especially Jon's part. I've been wanting to do a cover with my band where it's reversed and Jon's part is sung in clean vocals with his final ""What The Fuck?"" being sung over the final chorus."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,FunkmasterFurby,4,Sun Apr 26 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, the crowd was great. The band fucking burned that shit to the ground. Jon and Tilian just killed it.  Also, Hail the Sun was really great."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,Dbl_Helix,4,Sun Apr 26 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"I was there with my girlfriend and two roommates. Had VIP passes. The entire show was super sick, I was actually the most impressed with Bear Girl or whatever it was the most outside of DGD. Hail The Sun and Stolas were intense, and I love Polyphia so that was rad. Speaking of that super tall black guy in the crowd, my friend was looking for me and used him as a landmarker to find me. If anybody knows that guy, I wanna drink a beer with him. Lmfao."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,Morphang,2,Sun Apr 26 19:07:59 2015 UTC,"Bear Girl's bassist was an awesome showman and they were super tight as well, sounded just like their studio stuff"

Thanks to the people that moshed with me, thanks to the people that threw me up to crowd surf and thanks to everyone for being awesome."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,one_two_threve,3,Sun Apr 26 04:13:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for coming! It was so awesome, my first time crowd surfing and everyone was so chill with moving me up to the stage! Was a great time!"
dancegavindance,33vwjx,one_two_threve,3,Sun Apr 26 04:25:11 2015 UTC,I probably threw you up there man! I'm glad you had a blast.
dancegavindance,33vwjx,lolitslee,3,Sun Apr 26 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"Such a good show! I think hands down one of the most funnest show I have been to in the last 5 years. Stolas, HTS, & DGD slayed their sets. I think it may have been one of the best shows I've seen in Heaven as well."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,Jimmy-DeLaney,3,Sun Apr 26 13:43:54 2015 UTC,Dood i was the guy with the cute blonde chick on my shoulders for most of DGDs set. Hail the sun killed it and i met a lot of the band members afterwards. Does anybody remember the set list for DGD last night in ATL?
dancegavindance,33vwjx,ktm57ktm57,3,Sun Apr 26 17:52:06 2015 UTC,People were total assholes to Polyphia but it was a fun show. Bear Girl killed it
dancegavindance,33vwjx,dustycat21,2,Sun Apr 26 18:59:33 2015 UTC,Was so awesome!!! My brother told me the people behind me were making faces because I was swinging my long sweaty hair around.
dancegavindance,33vwjx,anjjelikka,2,Mon Apr 27 02:47:13 2015 UTC,"It was my second concert of theirs too. It was too amazing (except for the 6'5"" dude blocking the view in the front. Fuck him)."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,DCDance,4,Sun Apr 26 03:54:00 2015 UTC,"Haha I didn't notice him, but that's awesome you were there!"
dancegavindance,33vwjx,anjjelikka,3,Sun Apr 26 04:06:44 2015 UTC,"I think I know who you're talking about, did he have like an orange colored PFG shirt on?"
dancegavindance,33vwjx,wtf_are_crepes,3,Sun Apr 26 16:32:58 2015 UTC,"No, it was black and said (I think) Skyhaven."
dancegavindance,33vwjx,Captain_Scarblade,4,Sun Apr 26 16:52:20 2015 UTC,Oh haha the big black dude with the seahaven shirt on. I saw him toss a girl crowd surfing all the way up to the stage lmao.
dancegavindance,33uc9e,slayingomen,11,Sat Apr 25 18:31:14 2015 UTC,They posted this picture to their Facebook around the time acceptance speech came out. Very subtle but pretty funny. Also funny that Xbox music would choose that pic for their profile
dancegavindance,33uc9e,chalupa_batman27,2,Sat Apr 25 19:02:09 2015 UTC,It alternates between the morphed picture and the normal picture. Funny indeed

dancegavindance,33sf1n,Alexisandra,4,Sat Apr 25 08:06:12 2015 UTC,When I met them they were pretty chill and nice to talk to. Especially Matt and Tilian.
dancegavindance,33sf1n,lazenbooby,5,Sat Apr 25 13:22:43 2015 UTC,I'm convinced Matt has no emotions other than happy. Dude is cool as fuck
dancegavindance,33sf1n,lazenbooby,2,Sat Apr 25 17:35:41 2015 UTC,Also make sure you show them your DGD tattoo! They'll love it!

Still got a few decisions to make about the content and my artist has injured his shoulder though, so it won't be until after the show."
dancegavindance,33sf1n,Starshiee,2,Sat Apr 25 23:44:06 2015 UTC,They are super chill.  I didn't buy the VIP. They ended up chilling by the merch table after the show. So either way I got to meet them.

I feel like they would all be considered first press though"
dancegavindance,33r6od,rickman4L,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"I figured this would be the case, I ended up ordering it and asked the seller to open it and let me know which one it is. Hopefully I luck out and get the cyan/ultra clear, and if not I can try and trade it"

dancegavindance,33jkyo,HelloDepression,12,Thu Apr 23 01:09:45 2015 UTC,That's bad ass. this is what they wanted or they said they'd consider ending the band.  This is great news.  If you're on this sub pick it up. They'll never be rich but they'll keep making them if we keep supporting them.
dancegavindance,33jkyo,caseharts,2,Thu Apr 23 02:31:26 2015 UTC,When did they say they might disband if the album doesn't do well?
dancegavindance,33jkyo,DavidR525,4,Thu Apr 23 21:03:46 2015 UTC,Theres an interview where jon mess recently said they're all approaching 30 and either want to go to the next level or start doing other things. I can't find it now but it was a recent interview with mess.
dancegavindance,33jkyo,caseharts,3,Thu Apr 23 21:22:47 2015 UTC,Lets just hope he doesn't mature out of writing his lyrics.

dancegavindance,33jkyo,caseharts,3,Thu Apr 23 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well IG had a balance of silly/serious lyrics, so I wouldn't be surprised if the ratio slowly starts favoring serious lyrics in future albums."

dancegavindance,33jkyo,caseharts,2,Fri Apr 24 01:18:54 2015 UTC,I think we have more than our fair share of silly lyrics. I wouldn't be upset at all if the scale tipped in favor of serious lyrics in the future.
dancegavindance,33jkyo,viciousxvee,11,Sun Apr 26 22:51:34 2015 UTC,If they ever did end this band I hope they release one final song or EP or at least something to say goodbye.

dancegavindance,33je30,oldnewstwist,3,Thu Apr 23 00:10:04 2015 UTC,I bought this and love the shirt. Not really sure if the tape even works? I don't have a player so I wouldn't know. My mom made it seem like it wouldn't play but I dunno. Mostly bought the bundle for the shirt lol.
dancegavindance,33je30,CovetedBody,2,Thu Apr 23 03:24:29 2015 UTC,it should work.

I would hate to see a good and fresh tape get stuck or broken thanks to a bad tape player. Then, if that tape player works, listen away! And don't forget that a lot of older cars still have tape players in them.  Or just keep the tape for nostalgic purposes."
dancegavindance,33je30,CovetedBody,3,Thu Apr 23 06:20:11 2015 UTC,OK thanks. I'm likely not to give it a listen ever but I like to keep it on my desk since it's a cool little piece of merchandise.

dancegavindance,33je30,uniquerabbitturd,2,Thu Apr 23 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"The tape has amazing quality. The sound is nice and smooth, and the tape runs without skip or screech. I'm a tape fan, honestly. People like the sound of vinyl for the quality or the soft rub that lies underneath the music; I have a place in my heart for the sound tapes give off, especially after good use and listening.  I just got home from work and I am listening to it now. At first I thought it sounded a little high pitched when I put it in, but I had my roommate listen with and it's just my ears ringing and making it sound off."

For example, on rateyourmusic this album was one of the best rated in their discography, but once the Fantano-drones came along it got absolutely showered with 1s and fell below every album they ever made.

dancegavindance,33j53d,thePigWithAbat,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:25:28 2015 UTC,"I think Jon's lyrics are giberrish as usual (he's said he sometimes just uses screams as an instrument, basically), and Tilian's lyrics are the point.  It seems to be about the idea of being ""in love with the idea of someone"", where you're so into them that you just fantasize about how much you want to be with them (""take my money, take all that I've got"") and disconnect it from the actual person, thus ""expecting people to live in your head"" and ""I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved""."

dancegavindance,33j53d,Y_Machina,10,Wed Apr 22 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"What in the even fuck...? The degradation of women? I... your logic is... what...?  The song is, more evidently, about being greatly appreciated by someone or a lot of people (""I'm in love with the feeling that I'm loved"" and ""stroke my ego, turn me into God. I am God!""). From Tilian's lyrics, I get the feeling it's a really passionate self-realization about wanting someone incredibly badly, hence the entirety of the bridge after the second chorus. Jon's lyrics imply a sense of taking ""fame"" for granted, not necessarily being famous to the public but being extremely well-liked by people you know, and letting that go to your head. Hence the, ""show you my sack"" and ""a fabulous rape in the taint"". They're metaphorical for taking advantage of that which worships you, at least as I see it.  Jon himself says his lyrics aren't meant to be taken even close to literally. It's a somewhat meaningful, romantic-ish, slightly self-depreciating song wrapped inside a double entendre for jerking off."

dancegavindance,33betk,chrisrski97,11,Tue Apr 21 03:40:29 2015 UTC,"I dm'd him on twitter about a week ago asking for a review and after I saw the review, I dm'd him to tell him that the verse on Eagles vs. Crows is supposed to be over-the-top (Will Swan said so an interview) and I also said that I appreciated him taking my suggestion. He replied and seemed to get kinda mad at me, I think he really really hates this album"
dancegavindance,33betk,berniamacattack,5,Tue Apr 21 16:36:21 2015 UTC,"That's such a strange overreaction on his part.  I don't watch his videos often but in the past I've seen his reviews on QOTSA, Weezer, and Cage the Elephant. While I didn't always agree with him I thought his reviews were fair and educated. They are subjective after all. Until this one...  1/10 is beyond harsh even if you dislike the genre. That should be reserved for absurdly bad music. I mean I feel like even the shitty garageband demos I'd make with my band back in the day would be a 2/10.  Also idk why Will's lyrics were taken at face value. A little research can show he's hardly that kind of guy and he was portraying a character. A fair review wasn't gonna happen when its clear he isn't a fan of these kinds of vocals. Hopefully ""all press is good press"" applies here. It just sucks because this dude has some presence and I wouldn't want people making assumptions about DGD just cause of this review."
dancegavindance,33betk,BadFish19,4,Wed Apr 22 03:30:46 2015 UTC,Sounds like a generally hateful person.

dancegavindance,33betk,JSBUCK,6,Tue Apr 21 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda think he's ""trolling"" in a way.  I don't care if the vocals and the lyrics are subpar according to this guy.  To ignore the musicianship entirely and give this album a 1/10 is unjustified I think.  I have the feeling he gave this album such a low score because he knew it would stir up controversy and, in turn, get more people talking about his review.  So take this review as you will, but he's essentially just doing it for the views.  In my opinion, this will only hurt in credibility in the long run."
dancegavindance,33betk,zkonrad,1 point,Tue Apr 21 17:42:53 2015 UTC,Why would he need to do that? He's the biggest music critic on YouTube. You're just mad he gave it a bad review
dancegavindance,33betk,thefrontpageofreddit,2,Wed Apr 22 03:28:57 2015 UTC,So people like us can talk about it. Which leads to him getting more views.

Seemed like he already knew what he was going to give the album, which is fine and all but it takes away from his credibility.   Edit: Also, from the way he was name dropping obscure post-hardcore bands, he seems like a total tool"

dancegavindance,33betk,wildcard6270,3,Sun Apr 26 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i have no problem with opinions of it but all the hate on DGD is unnecessary."
dancegavindance,33betk,alphaglider,4,Tue Apr 21 04:41:54 2015 UTC,Actually Fantano has written music and been in bands. I've never gotten the argument that you can't be a critic if you're adept in the medium you're criticizing.
dancegavindance,33betk,Bazy0,3,Tue Apr 21 21:59:32 2015 UTC,"Well I sure as hell didn't say he couldn't be a critic. Someone on here made a brilliant point of not liking country music so they wouldn't really review a country album but if they did, they wouldn't discredit its value. I was wrong to assume that this ""nobody I don't know"" didn't play music or perform in bands before, but going by what you told me, it really isn't a defense. I don't listen to Jimi Hendrix but I can sure as hell appreciate what he does. Being in the position of being in a band or making music or creating art, and critiquing a band like DGD a 1/10 is something I won't agree with, regardless of my bias. Just like I wouldn't do that for say Nickelback or Metallica without giving it a fair opportunity."
dancegavindance,33betk,rickman4L,6,Tue Apr 21 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"The band members took the perception in an interesting way. On Twitter, Tilian and Will seemed pissed at his critical review. Jon just made fun of it."
dancegavindance,33betk,HelloDepression,6,Tue Apr 21 03:51:44 2015 UTC,"The guy does have a pretty big following on Youtube and gave the album perhaps the only ""1/10"" that he has ever given out before so I can see why they got upset.   I can totally understand someone not caring for this genre or this band, but in that case I think it defeats the purpose of doing the review in the first place. He knew from the start that he wasn't going to like the album it seems and was just looking to attack it and get a rise out of people."
dancegavindance,33betk,coldjeanz,2,Tue Apr 21 13:48:36 2015 UTC,I can't seem to find Will's reaction to it. You got a link? or did he remove it? All I see is a retweet

dancegavindance,33betk,HelloDepression,2,Tue Apr 21 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"This was actually a really interesting review. I liked how he put the music in context with the opening explanation of post-hardcore music, but I feel like he mis-catagorized and mis-contextualized Dance Gavin Dance. I honestly kind of agreed with a lot of his negative points, but not nearly to that degree. I don't think this review is as bad as everyone says it is, but it certainly isn't what I would call ""objective."""
dancegavindance,33betk,NeoSeth,2,Fri Apr 24 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"dude, he was literally just name dropping to make him sound as if he had any idea about the music.  If you actually listen to what he says about DGD you will realize he has never listened to any of their albums before, has no plan about their style, their quirks or their history.  He basically looked up Wikipedia before he wrote this, with the thought in mind he shits on the band."
dancegavindance,33betk,Orsonius,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:11:15 2015 UTC,"I did say that he mis-categorized them. I don't see how DGD could ever be considered a ""cliche"" band. Tillian's lyrics are pretty cliche on this album for the most part in my opinion, I won't lie, but DGD is definitely one of the more distinct bands in the genre. I also consider them much more prog-rock than post-hardcore at this point.  I'm not saying it wasn't a bad review, I just don't think it was as awful as people say. Obviously he was too harsh and had some sort of pre-existing prejudice against the band. Also, with regards to his name-dropping, I was ignoring that. His talk about the actual genre seemed fine to me, even if the bands he tried to use to demonstrate his point were not the most informed decision (Like seriously, Fall of Troy in a discussion of post-hardcore? I love them to death but I would wager their influence on the genre is negligible and honestly I would never classify them anywhere near the genre). But his explanation of the musical components of the genre were alright with me."
dancegavindance,33betk,NeoSeth,0,Mon Apr 27 15:57:01 2015 UTC,"but DGD is definitely one of the more distinct bands in the genre.   Obviously. When you listen to anything else on Rise Records you can tell they stand out. Which is why it is so apparent he has no idea what he is talking about.  I mean obviously there is a post hardcore element in all these bands, but phc is like the broadest genre ever. so it is literally meaningless."

No critic in their right mind would make such a brash rating and leave it be. I feel like he is purposefully trying to upset DGD fans or even the band. Maybe even trolling the communuty.  I couldn't even bother to finish the video. Dude just seems full of himself and that isn't something I can deal with.

He's hardly ignorant though, he's pretty well-versed on post-hardcore and it's offshoots.

He does make some fair points though, DGD need to switch it up a bit if they wanna stay relevant going forwards. I've been a fan since about 2008 and they were my favourite band for a long time but they have pretty much lost my interest on the last two records.  For me this album was a 5.5/10 at best which is shame considering how much I have loved this band in the past."
dancegavindance,338lj4,iPim,-3,Mon Apr 20 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"Makes me smile. A person like that doesn't deserve to get into and appreciate dgd. I can review a Katy Perry (obviously his type of music) or a 50 cent album that I know I'm going to hate, and fucking hate on it too. And the way he said he's not into dgd or circa clearly shows he's not into this type of music.  I  hope this guy feels on his high horse by probably turning a few people off this record...I hope this guy falls down some stairs today. Because if there's nothing worse than a critic, it's a fucking private loser non professional critic."

Everything from the Zachary killing the lead on the chorus, to the now confirmed tongue and cheek lyrics, this is definitely one of their best written songs. Really hoping this is the next ""official"" single. I really think this could be the song that launches them to the next level of recognition (in the sense Mess was talking about in the last interview before this released).  On a side note, I feel like most songs I come back to by dgd are the one that talk less about romantic relationships and more on interpersonal/environmental relationships i.e. Me and Zoloft, Happiness, Carve and now to a degree thematically, Lost and Variation."

dancegavindance,32okd6,crazymunky32,3,Wed Apr 15 19:16:16 2015 UTC,I usually go with an hour late. During the switch between bands the front usually gets washed out by people getting air so as long as you get there before dgd sets up you can make it to the front easy

dancegavindance,32nn3c,MG92489,4,Wed Apr 15 11:46:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I never thought that song was worthy of being the encore song. Though I imagine its very fun to yell the first line of the song with the whole crowd

He is ""legend because of you"" shows how God is important because of the person. If anything it's one of the heaviest songs in lyrical content because of the tone. The song could also be seen from another perspective, since it is an extended metaphor or allegory. From the beginning of the song this could be read as a young performer who increases the fame of his/her predecessor. That predecessor knows their protege is better than him/ her and develops a complex in which he/she thinks the performer could not be where he/she is without the predecessor. The way I wrote it is confusing but I hope you understand. This could be applied to God of course. Jon's lines can be about organized religion when speaking of God but also about the music industry on famous performers. Take your time to read each line individually like poetry and discover your own interpretations. It's ice to know what the song is about but it's way more fun to discover meaning on your own and Jon's lyrics are the best to do that with!"

The jigggler,  we own the night,  variation,  Eagles vs crows, carve,  the cuddler,  tree village,  nasa, uneasy hearts weigh the most, hot water on wool,  rock solid,  alex English, lemon mirangue tie, all parts of robot with human hair,  strawberry swisher all parts aswell, lost,  both parts of turn off the lights im watching back to the future. And so much more its pretty much all great. Enjoy listening :)  its been 10 years and theyre still my favorite band.

I'm From Cuba, Everyone Else Has One Brain, for their third album it's a tie between Rock Solid and Alex English, Carl Barker, Spooks, The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 4, and I still haven't found my favorite on their new album but it would probably have to be Death of a Strawberry.

My first listen i didnt like it as much after shark dad i thought it was just alot of tilian, but from my 2nd listen on i started picking out different elements of each of their albums and i find myself loving it more with every listen. Self title is still my favorite but this ones up there.  Tilian is great with them and im glad theyve finally done 2 albums in a row with all the same people"
dancegavindance,328uar,bolievethrice,2,Sun Apr 12 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way, DBM was my favorite album by them but as soon as I heard the album preview (the 1 minute clips of each song) I knew that this might just dethrone the king.

dancegavindance,327kof,saomitch,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"What do you have against buying records at Hot Topic? They offer some of the best exclusives at decent prices. Depending on your location, they treat the stock well. Hot Topic and the people deciding what they'll put out are doing pretty awesome things for listeners of this kind of music. You're free to shop and not shop where you want, but if it's just a ""Eww Hot Topic"" thing, you're missing out."
dancegavindance,327kof,mrsjamesfranco,1 point,Tue Apr 14 07:54:15 2015 UTC,"Not that, I just prefer supporting local record stores over chains, that's all. :)"
dancegavindance,327kof,rickman4L,1 point,Tue Apr 14 14:56:34 2015 UTC,"I totally get that, but most local stores aren't going to stock Dance Gavin Dance and many other bands related to this scene. By buying these releases from Hot Topic, you're showing them people want more. Hot Topic's vinyl selection has seriously boomed since 2009, and that's because they've done a great job listening to their consumers, and their consumers have bought what they've demanded. Any business that does that is pretty cool, chain or not. Ordering from SRC is not much better (if at all... SRC kinda blows). I'm glad you got your record, but I think if you keep collecting, you'll find yourself at Hot Topic soon enough. :)"
dancegavindance,327kof,Xjuturnaxstarx,1 point,Wed Apr 15 05:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I will as well, like I said, I simply buy local when I can. For this record, HT was out and SRC had it in, so I got it like that.  I don't have any problem with HT, but I also find a lot of my local shows supply releases in these genres, so I'll go there."
dancegavindance,327c2b,HelloDepression,11,Sat Apr 11 05:16:04 2015 UTC,"It's about human being's primal desire to fit in, and be ""part of the pack"", fear of death, and how religion fills that role for people.  It then goes into how quickly people are to shun others for something as simple as saying a bad word.  Jon finishes the song with a little bit about how religion/society is never ending, and disfunctional, or ""grew from decay""."
dancegavindance,327c2b,Vomiting_Winter,2,Sat Apr 11 14:43:05 2015 UTC,It means what you want it to man.. No ones answer is right
dancegavindance,327c2b,bolievethrice,2,Sun Apr 12 17:30:28 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say its messed up. I will say I feel like this album is arguably one of the easiest DGD albums to find any kind of meaning in each song. Am I the only one that found a constant theme of loneliness and feeling lost as well as many mentions to God in this album?
dancegavindance,327c2b,Blurry15,2,Tue Apr 14 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"As much as I love this record I have to say that it's pretty fucking depressing, so many of the lyrics relate to shit I'm going through now."
dancegavindance,327c2b,jonmayer,2,Tue Apr 14 17:47:03 2015 UTC,I can sympathize with this a bit myself. Not sure exactly what you are going through exactly but I myself have been experiencing a sense of loneliness and feeling lost. It is pretty depressing but singing along to this album in my car makes me feel better.

I'd be willing to wager the bullmoose and interpunk and shopradiocast variants are more oxblood. Although merchnow advertised 300/700/1000, they didn't state that they would exclusively sell them on their site. For example, hot topic has sold src exclusives before. I'm sure the ht variant will be new as travis is an extremely  credible source."

dancegavindance,3230ph,rickman4L,2,Wed Apr 15 17:04:32 2015 UTC,"Good stuff. I want to say they might not have instant gratification on vinyl on tour. I think the only vinyl they have on tour is the secret band ep and dgd Flexi discs from like 2012. Let me know if I'm wrong tho, I don't see them until 5/5"
dancegavindance,3230ph,rickman4L,1 point,Sat Apr 11 08:58:03 2015 UTC,"I saw that amazon will has a preorder vinyl available, any idea what color it will be?"
dancegavindance,321abk,meleesurvive,7,Thu Apr 9 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"My guess is on songs like Stroke God, We Own the Night, and without a doubt, On the Run. Maybe even Variation after all the talk about it. Since it's the Instant Gratification tour, I want them to play every song, I love the new album. But I know that's a very long set and they have to put some older stuff too."
dancegavindance,321abk,Anivia_on_Fire,3,Thu Apr 9 20:32:24 2015 UTC,I would be perfectly okay with them playing all of Instant Gratification and nothing else. It'll be my 10th time seeing them next month.
dancegavindance,321abk,rickman4L,2,Thu Apr 9 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"Damn dude! This will only be my fourth time seeing them, and my third time meeting them all. There was sadly no VIPs for Dance Gavin Dance on the Take Action tour."
dancegavindance,321abk,Anivia_on_Fire,3,Thu Apr 9 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"They're all pretty accessible dudes, VIP or not. I've been seeing them since the end of the Happiness era."

dancegavindance,321abk,Vomiting_Winter,4,Thu Apr 9 20:11:48 2015 UTC,Sadly probably not Variation because Tillian will get exhausted singing those F#5s.
dancegavindance,321abk,xarahn,3,Thu Apr 9 21:07:56 2015 UTC,As much as I love Variation I can't see it being played live. It just sounds too difficult. My favorite songs from most of their albums never seem to be playable live lol
dancegavindance,321abk,coldjeanz,3,Fri Apr 10 12:39:47 2015 UTC,I really hope they close with Lost and encore with Eagles vs. Crows. Either that or have EvsC as part of the main lineup and encore old stuff
dancegavindance,321abk,dumbquestionsorryugh,2,Thu Apr 9 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping all of them lol if not I'd like to see shark dad because live it'll probly be nuts, awkward for the bReAkdownz, and eagle vs crows for wills 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
dancegavindance,321abk,thePigWithAbat,2,Thu Apr 9 20:54:01 2015 UTC,I think Death of a Strawberry will be played. Very pop like quality to it. Good for getting a pretty pumped up mood.
dancegavindance,321abk,HerBride,3,Thu Apr 9 21:03:28 2015 UTC,"It may be my favorite on the album but sadly I couldn't see it in their set. Prove me wrong, DGD."
dancegavindance,321abk,rickman4L,2,Thu Apr 9 22:55:22 2015 UTC,I know right. So sad they didn't have a tour date in MN. I really wanted to see their set.
dancegavindance,321abk,HerBride,2,Thu Apr 9 22:56:24 2015 UTC,"Shark Dad has been requested a lot and Death of a Strawberry as well. But I'll be happy seeing them play anything. I'd much rather not hear On the Run but if it's cemented on the playlist then oh well.  First time seeing them on the 14th, I'm in for quite a ride and will enjoy every second"
dancegavindance,321abk,Ageha-Yoshina,1 point,Fri Apr 10 05:34:03 2015 UTC,"I recently went to the Take Action Tour with DGD and I know they played On The Run. So, I'm sure they will play On The Run, We Own The Night, and hopefully Awkward! I'll be seeing them on the 15th in Mesa and I'll post what I find out after the show!"
dancegavindance,321abk,ExOhFelony,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:47:06 2015 UTC,I went to the album release show in sacramento they mainly did old stuff like dtbm and some happiness and self title a few songs from acceptance speech but only on the run from this album. Sadly i had tickets for the 2nd night but got sick and could only make it to the 1st. But only song they did from instant gratification was on the run. You guys are lucky you will see more because the album will have been out so theyll play more from it but i guess i was lucky to get it a bit earlier. This was my 7th time seeing them and definitely not the last
dancegavindance,321abk,killrtaco,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:14:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input!! I'm sure it was fun, next weekend is only my 2nd time seeing them. I wonder how their setlist will change once the tour officially starts, considering its for the release of Instant Gratification"
dancegavindance,321abk,killrtaco,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:20:42 2015 UTC,Yea since the album would be out and since they streamed it early i expect they will play the new stuff for the other shows and will hopefully play again in sacramento this summer or something before i move for school. But i think they only played on the run (that 1st night atleast)  because it was their first time selling the cd ever so we would have never heard the songs in order to keep it fun so its not just everything we havent heard. Id be surprised if it stayed like that for the tour i mean after all it is the album tour

dancegavindance,31zoo5,DavidR525,2,Thu Apr 9 16:35:44 2015 UTC,Have you read the lyrics? It's all serious shit about life and God without any of the silly lyrics Dance Gavin Dance is known for.
dancegavindance,31zoo5,ian_n,2,Thu Apr 9 19:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their lyrics are very anti-religion on this newest record."
dancegavindance,31zoo5,DavidR525,3,Thu Apr 9 22:26:43 2015 UTC,Really? I interpreted the song as more like feeling that there is something above but not fully convinced. Nothing really hating on religion.
dancegavindance,31zoo5,Starshiee,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:40:51 2015 UTC,"i wouldnt go as far as to say ""Anti-Religion"" but more, its all about questioning religion, for the most part. and especially one like Stroke God Millionaire, where the point of view of the singer is this guy with this super huge ego and god complex. but then later on, in Lost, he is looking to turn to a higher power, and is lost and needs direction."
dancegavindance,31zoo5,Ageha-Yoshina,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"Haven't had the chance to fully read all the lyrics, just looked at bits and pieces for this one since it didn't get me at first but it definitely is different from how they usually write lyrics.  I get what you meant. I didn't get any of the God feeling that you mentioned but more of life and how society is."
dancegavindance,31zoo5,lazenbooby,5,Fri Apr 10 05:31:48 2015 UTC,Right? Probably my favourite and nobody else seemed to like it as much!  I've been at work for 7 hours and I've not stopped singing the chorus in my head.

dancegavindance,31t9xy,NotEnoughFire,9,Wed Apr 8 08:33:15 2015 UTC,"Awkward, Variation, Eagles vs. Crows, and Death of a Strawberry are amazing. Especially the heavier parts of the songs and the rap in Eagles vs. Crows."

dancegavindance,31t9xy,dumbquestionsorryugh,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:16:49 2015 UTC,"I think the album would have ended phenomenally well with Variation. Then again, it flows into Lost so well so I have no complaints"
dancegavindance,31t9xy,RepzPH,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:41:05 2015 UTC,"That's true. But after listening to Lost about 30 times last night, it's easily my favorite song on the album and the perfect ending. It's just a huge meltdown of a song that has a lot of emotion attached to it. This is why I love Tilian because you can hear his passion in writing when he sings."

dancegavindance,31tbx5,rickman4L,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:45:33 2015 UTC,My favourite from the album.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,HelloDepression,9,Wed Apr 8 00:27:53 2015 UTC,As soon as I heard that beginning riff I knew I was going to love this song.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Piggy-,8,Wed Apr 8 05:03:07 2015 UTC,Pls come back Zac.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Bowlermicah,9,Wed Apr 8 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"That breakdown is heavy as fuck. Everyone says Shark Dad is the heaviest DGD song ever, but I don't know this song has some really heavy parts."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,JSBUCK,5,Wed Apr 8 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah but it's just the breakdown, Shark Dad is structured to be heavy throughout."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Y_Machina,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:18:48 2015 UTC,True. I've just never heard something that heavy from DGD lol.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,JSBUCK,4,Wed Apr 8 17:20:36 2015 UTC,"I think we all have, though! Need Money is pretty hard, Demo Team is pretty hard--go way, way back and People You Know is pretty fucking brutal, as is Hot Water On Wool-R."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Y_Machina,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:09:21 2015 UTC,"Eh I disagree. Need money, demo team, and people we know aren't close to the heaviness of shark dad and Awkward. In my opinion of course."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,JSBUCK,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:45:55 2015 UTC,The heaviness in Awkward is comparable to the heaviness of Carve which is one of the heaviest songs dgd has.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,rickman4L,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"On that note, it is the heaviest song they've written. But it's rooted in that they've gone heavy and brutal before."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Y_Machina,4,Wed Apr 8 18:09:58 2015 UTC,This song literally encompasses what DGD is.
dancegavindance,31tcwy,dumbquestionsorryugh,3,Wed Apr 8 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"Damn, I disagree with this a lot. This is the normal structure verse-chorus-verse-chorus-breakdown-chorus that a lot of bands do. I love this song and I love that they put their own feel to it, but if there's a song I'd pick that encompasses DGD's sound it wouldn't be this one. Just my opinion"
dancegavindance,31tcwy,Husky127,2,Thu Apr 9 20:39:03 2015 UTC,All good bro. I respect your opinion. At least we share loving the band as common ground :)
dancegavindance,31tcwy,dumbquestionsorryugh,4,Thu Apr 9 22:28:33 2015 UTC,"having a text argument with my friend over this song... he thinks this song is ""AMAZING"".  i think that the ""Dont make this Awkward"" line is dumb, and annoying everything the rest of the song is perfect but this line really ruins it for me(the clean vocals make it too noticeable to dismiss )."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,itux82,2,Thu Apr 9 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"Cringeworthy lyrics have always been a problem with me and DGD songs, but once I get past it, I start to enjoy them. Strawberry Swisher Pt. 1's lyrics used to turn me off, but after listening to it a few times, it just ""clicked."" I cringed at that line too, but once you listen to it a few times, you'll learn to appreciate it."
dancegavindance,31tcwy,thedeafpoliceman,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:08:31 2015 UTC,"Nah man I think it fits absolutely perfectly. It's the story of a friend (most likely a girl if you trust Jon Mess's lyrics as being relevant) who has a power and control issue and constantly tears down the main character. ""Don't make this awkward"" is exactly what I would expect to hear."
dancegavindance,31tapx,HelloDepression,3,Wed Apr 8 00:11:29 2015 UTC,Great song. Gotta be one of my favorit thus far.
dancegavindance,31tapx,blastingmybarriers,3,Wed Apr 8 14:09:17 2015 UTC,"I'm listening to the album front to back now (up to legend) and I'm getting so amped for variation, feels like everyone is already calling it the best song on the album"
dancegavindance,31tapx,sizeablescars,5,Wed Apr 8 18:53:45 2015 UTC,This chorus is beautiful...love it when Mess & Tilian both share the vocal spotlight
dancegavindance,31tapx,NotEnoughFire,2,Wed Apr 8 08:27:18 2015 UTC,"This is so different from everything else on here. It seems to have a much more serious tone.   ""Dam up the river, we can take it slow."""
dancegavindance,31tapx,Bowlermicah,2,Wed Apr 8 15:24:43 2015 UTC,This has to be the best song on the entire album
dancegavindance,31tapx,jet9tmnt,2,Wed Apr 8 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"I really like this song, because I really like everything DGD releases, but I don't understand how people are calling this the best song on the album. Stroke God/Something New/Strawberry/Cuddler/EvC are all SO much better than this song IMO."
dancegavindance,31tapx,Husky127,7,Wed Apr 8 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"It just has this ""epic"" DGD feel similar to songs like Times New Roman or Purple Reign. Incredibly catchy and has a beast of a chorus with Tilian and Jon killing it together. It's by far my favorite on the album"

dancegavindance,31tbie,Bowlermicah,3,Wed Apr 8 08:26:44 2015 UTC,"Jon and Tilian both kill it. I love Tilian's intro and slower bridge, plus his background singing over Mess' screaming after the soft bridge."
dancegavindance,31tbie,PoorigusGracie,2,Wed Apr 8 15:23:44 2015 UTC,"This album so far is everything, they really fucking delivered."
dancegavindance,31tbie,Dbl_Helix,2,Wed Apr 8 13:05:50 2015 UTC,Everyone seems to be stuck on Variation. Shark Dad is IT for me. This song is THE song.
dancegavindance,31tcja,HelloDepression,7,Wed Apr 8 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"This is the most unique song on the album, musically I think. The guitars are rich and all over the place, the progression from one part to the next is so smooth but quick. It has wonderful Mess and Tillian moments. It reminds me of Swan Soup, everything sounds chaotic, but if you pay attention it's all very orchestrated."
dancegavindance,31tcja,Y_Machina,7,Wed Apr 8 05:56:22 2015 UTC,"Oh man this is my favorite song as of right now, so damn groovy. Loving the vocals and bass on the chorus"
dancegavindance,31tcja,hotwiringauterus,6,Wed Apr 8 01:46:19 2015 UTC,I feel like this song doesn't get enough love
dancegavindance,31tcja,thePigWithAbat,3,Wed Apr 8 03:13:03 2015 UTC,This is near the top of the album for me. No idea where the hype is. It completely exemplifies the band's unique mix of post-hardcore with poppy/funky music.
dancegavindance,31tcja,Philosoaxolotl,7,Wed Apr 8 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"Talk about your feelings...? I'm going pitch black.   Talk about MY feelings? I don't wanna, fuck that!"

dancegavindance,31tcja,Vomiting_Winter,2,Wed Apr 8 11:38:52 2015 UTC,The Cuddler and the Jiggler have the same vibe.
dancegavindance,31tcja,FreshensHMacy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:34:26 2015 UTC,"Namewise yes. I find it way more relative to carve. Short, screaming verses with a killer catchy (corny) spunky chorus."

dancegavindance,31ta44,Bowlermicah,2,Wed Apr 8 00:14:17 2015 UTC,"I believe they made this review when only the original 3 or 4 singles were out. Either way, it's still preposterous"

Do you think it was just maybe your playlist was on shuffle in the shower. I dont think it takes anything away. The only reason I think people are hard on On The Run is because its been out for so long its like old news. I think once the newness wears off the other songs it will be recognized for how good it is."

dancegavindance,31pgbg,bolievethrice,6,Thu Apr 9 07:47:12 2015 UTC,"Alright so my list is probably very different from most people here. I put Deathstar last because it has possibly my 3 least favorite DGD songs of all time.   DBM II - it's a hard call for the number 1 spot, but I have to give it to the album that I consistently go back to most often. DBM I - I'm torn because I love Happiness, but DBM I was my first DGD record so it has to have some special treatment. Happiness - A solid fucking album front to back. Not a song on here that I don't love.  Instant Gratufication - I'm obsessed with the new album, but I can't put it in front of the 3 incredible albums above. I just haven't had time to let it sink in. If I had to make a prediction it might surpass DBM I if I keep enjoying it as much as I already am. WISIRO - Not much to say, I just love this EP Acceptance Speech - While I did thoroughly enjoy most of this album, some songs were just forgettable. Tilian's vocals were also not nearly as good as they were in ToM or IG. Deathstar - I know this is many DGD fans favorite...but I just can't stand Caviar. No other DGD album has a song that I genuinely don't like except this one. There are also many forgettable tracks for me. While uneasy hearts, Alex English, and Zoloft are some of my favorite DGD songs the rest of the album isn't that incredible to me."
dancegavindance,31pgbg,JSBUCK,4,Tue Apr 7 06:45:32 2015 UTC,Wow. I thought the chorus to Caviar was one of the most harmonically brilliant things I've ever heard from DGD. And the tone of the two singers together just blows me away. It just genuinely moves me.

dancegavindance,31pgbg,kage6613,5,Tue Apr 7 09:14:10 2015 UTC,"Not one bad song. The only band (besides NOFX before wolves) that I can really say that about. Sometimes I think I can't sit through hot wool, but I do every time (singing it). DBm 1 and 2 took me years to get into, but once I did it was amazing and dbm2 is close to my favorite now. The second half of acceptance speech, I hated for months. But again one day it clicked and that second half has been my favorite since. Fuck I love dance Gavin dance. I've spent more time being opened minded , accepting, and understanding than anything else really in my life. I love you swan, mess, and Mingus. Johnny, tillian, Kurt and garren."
dancegavindance,31pgbg,bolievethrice,3,Thu Apr 9 07:45:09 2015 UTC,"A lot of ya'll are sleeping on DBM, I mean honestly that album is God tier. Will had the crazy leads and really showcased his ability to move quickly not just between strings an notes but down the fretboard and back (idk, as a guitar player, I appreciate how perfect he is at it), AS WELL AS playing some riffs to allow Sean to shine. Sean had a noticeable different style and utilized a lot of tapping styles and created some leads that just make some of the songs what they are (disclaimer: Will is the better guitarist, I just don't think Sean always receives the credit he deserves). Eric always gets shit on by a lot of reviews for DBM, but he had some bass lines that just fit in perfectly to the songs. Matt, what else is there to say that hasn't been said? From day 1, Swan's little drummer boy has brought in the heavy with the fast double base while showcasing his knack for odd beats and rhythms along with a sexy set of drum licks that I can honestly now recognize as his style of drumming within several albums because of DBM. This album is regarded by many as Jon's worst in terms of vocal capability, but the raspy growl that sputted out in bursts in DBM (as well as ST) just gave Jon the angry/emotional edge that people could fucking mosh to, and I personally like the lyrics, very vague, very cynical. And last but not least, Jonny. The asshole we love to hate really just blew everybody away, reaching the highest of highs in songs like ""Turn off the lights..."" and showcasing his soul-based style in songs like ""Times new roman"" and ""Backwards pumpkin."" This is the album that made people realize that this local sacramento high school band could go far, and apparently now even without Jonny. One question I wanna ask you guys is: As good as you think Variation is (don't get me wrong, I love it too), does it even come close to Times New Roman?  To get to the point my list would be: 1. DBM 2. Happiness (Jon and Jonny gone? No fucking problem) 3. DBMII 4. IG 5. ST 6. AS"

I say this because I was introduced to DGD with Times and Lemon Meringe Tie a bit after the S/T was released. Like everyone else, I was a Jonny Craig stan. He had an amazing voice and I did (and still do) love R&B and that's what his voice brought to DGD in my mind at the time. Then I saw the video for Zoloft. Dug Kurt. Listened to all of ST, kinda of didn't stick at all but as the albums aged with me I spun st more. Zac had a big presence online (i bough ever original Good Health Cd and the red scicors shirt. I loved thqt side project and dude is awesome) and I really dug Tree Village, then Happiness comes out? Instant favorite, from the funk to the bass lines but the fact Will and Kurt wrote lyrics and the whole album was essentially a concept album on the pursuit of Happiness and that the epynoymous track was the saddest hooked me. Still my most replayed and visited album. I wanted to like DBM2 and I did but it didn't stick with me besides Elder Goose. I preferred Kurt in DGD and Jonny in Emarosa. After seeing them live with every line up change once (somehow thru a stroke of luck) until AS, I liked Kurt and Zac in the band. But AS I felt like they hit a stride and I can revisit that album more than the Jonny ones year+ later. I also like that the band is super drama free now and made a stellar record that retreads nothing, like Will intended ( I also didn't like DBM2 cuz it felt like fan service to Jonny fans that wouldn't leave them alone knowing good and well he would bring turmoil)."

dancegavindance,31pgbg,iBeProFinn,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:45:33 2015 UTC,Death Star - Solid fucking album with great vocals from Kurt that surprised after transitioning from Jonny. I just thought Kurts work with the band was more cohesive .. probably bc he's a better individual. And love Mess on this album. I wouldn't say this album has a favorite song of mine by DGD but I think overall just their most solid album. DBM - nothing like the original. The songs that got me into the band to begin with. Solid album also with a few snoozers for me .. I think what has me for a difference was Mess was largely unintelligible on this album. His delivery has vastly improved since.  Happiness - was actually one of the last DGD albums I bought. I was skeptical about no Mess screaming. But i pleasantly surprised. Will is no Mess but it was admirable.. better than me lol. Kurt once again is Kurt. Great funky album with not a bad song to be found imho.  IG - I'm digging it already. And I haven't even listened to it all already. I'm trying to stay strong and not download a leak. I'm seeing them on the 26th and I'll buy it there. But great tracks so far. Eagle vs Crows is epic. Swan rapping was perfection. Nice funky track. I dig the funk in DGD songs.  AC - I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Tilian fits in well I think. Though imho I think he sounds much better with tides of man. And secretly I'm hoping they transition to someone else soon. The poppy sound just loses me sometimes but hey who am i?  DBM2 - not that I don't like this album bc I do. It's great. I love almost every dgd song and I can be listening to almost any album at any given time but i just think overall it's the weakest output from them. Well aside from the ep.. WISIRO - Its an ep.. production was poor imho bUT it's an ep. What can you expect. .doesn't get much play from me.    There you go.

dancegavindance,31nb61,NOhmdD,6,Mon Apr 6 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"Personally I love how his voice has evolved and IG is the best it's ever been. To be fair though, I always think he sounds great until I hear the next album, and then that somehow gets blown out of the water again."
dancegavindance,31nb61,paradycz,3,Mon Apr 6 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he has reached his peak..perhaps the next evolution to him is more meaningful lyrics, akin to Cory Lockwood."

dancegavindance,31nb61,Husky127,5,Tue Apr 7 15:54:11 2015 UTC,"Whatever he did between DBM2 and Acceptance Speech, I think, did him the most good in terms of clarity and intensity. Going out on a limb and saying that doing Secret Band helped him develop a stronger presence."
dancegavindance,31nb61,Y_Machina,5,Mon Apr 6 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"I was never too impressed with Mess' vocals until AS came out. He made a huge improvement from DBM II to AS, and with IG ""out"" now he sounds even better.  I went from being kind of impartial towards Mess on DBM I, Deathstar, and DBM II to a super Jon Mess fan from AS onward."
dancegavindance,31nb61,JSBUCK,3,Mon Apr 6 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"I like that his vocals on the newest record are almost a combination of his super-refined AS style, and the more raw and emotive style of his younger days with the band (Royal Ocean, DBM1, etc.). I think he sounds better than ever, certainly with more depth and character to his voice than Acceptance Speech had. Knowing Jon, he'll continue to evolve, but I think his new style is more of a revisitation of the harsher and rawer sound such as he had before he cleaned up his technique than anything else. He's putting the best of both Jon-Mess-Worlds together, and I'm excited to see where it goes."
dancegavindance,31nb61,Kanex,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:16:26 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I came here to say. There are subtle differences between the three latest of the albums he's performed on, but for the most part the leaning curve has started to level out."
dancegavindance,31nb61,GalacticCatt,2,Wed Apr 8 01:52:20 2015 UTC,"Me and my friend were actually discussing this not too long ago. Yes, I believe that Mess has reached his peak in vocal progression. Acceptance Speech was when he got to that point, and he's sounded virtually the same since then. It doesn't matter to me though, because he sounds pitch perfect."
dancegavindance,31nb61,manlysuperpanda,2,Mon Apr 6 21:13:07 2015 UTC,"I really have a special place in my heart for Jon's screaming.  WISRO, DtBM, and DeathStar have the more harsh, intense screams and lyrics that, IMO are a bit more angry than later albums.  Downtown Battle Mountain II was actually an album I enjoyed a shitton, mostly for the sound, but just as much for Jon's new and slightly different screaming style, and the funkier lyrics.  With Acceptance Speech, Jon really found a groove with Tillian, it's really obvious. There's an amazing mix that they have together. And when you only focus on Jon's screaming from AS, his refined style and lyrical structure and just on top.  As for Instant Gratification? I haven't heard anything other than what has been put up on the Tubes. But I love the living shit out of it.  Edit (because phones suck): His vocals have changed amazingly over the albums and I think that maybe, yes, he has hit his peak and his voice is ""at it's prime"", but who knows, he could pull some crazy new style out of nowhere, or start going backward in progression."
dancegavindance,31nb61,oldnewstwist,0,Tue Apr 7 05:19:20 2015 UTC,I think his voice has gotten worse on each album. I think his cadence is the same in every song and he can't sing his own shit live. Still love a lot of his lyrics though

dancegavindance,31n1ss,AhTreyYou,5,Tue Apr 7 02:38:51 2015 UTC,"I had a realization a little while ago: I doubt that this was the intention but rather just the way it worked out. Most people feel DBM1 was a better showcase of Jonny's abilities than DBM2. Though I love Jon on the first record he was still raw and said he later went on to refine his technique.   I see DBM2 as kind of the reverse, sort of like a mirror. Jonny is still great but Jon Mess really shines on this record. He goes absolutely ham. Part 2½, Thug City, Need Money, Heat Seeking Ghost of Sex, are some of my favourites but he's great all throughout. The bonus track People You Knew is also one of my fav songs."

dancegavindance,31m5bd,Jordan311R,4,Mon Apr 6 10:36:20 2015 UTC,My favorite song by far. Tilian absolutely kills. To me that song defines the Tilian era of DGD. It all just comes together so well.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,cha0ss0ldier,5,Mon Apr 6 14:45:20 2015 UTC,"This song is absolutely phenomenal. I didn't really know what to expect. I'm really blown away by this track. I was thinking that Awkward would be my favorite, but I think that goes to this."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Will2792,3,Mon Apr 6 18:47:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just a coincidence but the lyrics in the chorus: Got me believing you been stuck and glued in frequent doubt. Coming from the secret band song ""Stuck and glued"". Just thought it was a tad interesting."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Tar28,6,Mon Apr 6 22:45:09 2015 UTC,"Its actually one of my least favorite songs on the album so far. Its not quite heavy or quite feely enough.

dancegavindance,31m5bd,VintagePain,7,Mon Apr 6 12:09:02 2015 UTC,"well in my opinon, dude tillian hits some of the highest notes i've ever heard at the start of the song. like i doubt anthony green could hit those they are so high. and later on it has that mess/tillian double voice thing which is cool through speakers but insanely cool through headphones. musically, it's just typical dgd, which isn't a insult or anything it just, is. the song as a whole shows off how they've incorporated tillian into the band while still being able to keep that edge they've become known for. okay i gotta get back to studying. hope this helped!"
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Balloonsdontfly,7,Mon Apr 6 12:57:06 2015 UTC,that mess/tillian double voice thing    I love that part. Best part of the song IMO. I thought that's what everyone else loved too.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,ian_n,3,Mon Apr 6 16:05:27 2015 UTC,I've been blasting that part at work all day. It might be my favorite exchange of the whole album.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,paradycz,3,Mon Apr 6 19:13:02 2015 UTC,Yes! I love getting through that breakdown just to hear it again haha
dancegavindance,31m5bd,DoctorWhatMD,3,Tue Apr 7 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I placed Variation as one of my favorites off the album was because Lost was kinda a let down for being the last track.  We had Turn Off the Lights pt.2 and Purple Reign for the last two albums and they were amazing songs to end great albums.  But I don't get that feeling from Lost. I feel like Variation should of ended the album considering how Tilian/Mess we're able to end the song with their dual vocals. This is the main reason why it's really gotten my attention and why I like it so much.  Musically, while it doesn't stand out like Death of a Strawberry or Awkward, definitely isn't standards or going with the flow. I just think that this is one of those songs where it sounded like a new song once Mess and Tilian took over with vocals.  It's allow one of the songs where I felt okay with all of Tilian's lyrics.  While it might not be similar to the DGD style or could be seen from other people, those other bands still wouldn't be able to keep up or make a so called genre song sound this good.   I had no idea people were ragging on Shark Dad. I don't see how people wouldn't like it."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Ageha-Yoshina,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:51:49 2015 UTC,Lost was one of the emotionally-hardest-hitting songs on the album for me. The music is REAL in that song. The modulation somewhere near the end was genius and unexpected. That was what sent this song over the top for me. I think either Variation or Lost could have ended it. I do wish Lost were longer though. It would give more time for the overtones to settle into your soul.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,GalacticCatt,2,Wed Apr 8 02:15:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that insight, I can definitely see where you're coming from. It started to grow on me honestly and I can see how it might of been a little better if it was longer.  I remember that I preferred the middle over how it started more, I was feeling like it should of had a different intro while keeping the start of ""I am lost. Need a god."" Chorus in the middle. But regardless, it definitely isn't bad and not as disappointing as I made myself think it was."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Ageha-Yoshina,3,Thu Apr 9 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. Shark Dad is one of the better ones on the album IMO. I think my issue with Variation, and Lost too for that matter, is that they don't really hit that DGD niche for me. They sound like run of the mill post hardcore songs that I'd hear from up and coming bands who just need to prove they have some potential. It's not as unique as their previous records. With that being said, this album is top notch for sure. Death of a Strawberry, Shark Dad, Something New, The Cuddler, and the three singles are all supreme."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,TheOnlyOrtega,4,Mon Apr 6 14:47:28 2015 UTC,not as unique as their previous records   Did we listen to the same album? This is definitely one of their more unique releases.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,jonmayer,3,Tue Apr 7 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"He's talking about Variation, and I totally agree that Variation just sounds too... post-hardcore. Its not unique. Its simplistic rhythms mixed with a generic sound."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,VintagePain,2,Tue Apr 7 15:50:39 2015 UTC,simplistic   generic   So clearly we heard two different songs if that's what you take away from listening to Variation.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,jonmayer,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. This album encompasses so many sides of post-hardcore, but none of it sounds generic. Simple, yes. generic, absolutely not.  And Tilian is going to turn into a dog whistle if he continues on this path. Demo Team and Variation are both ridiculously high. It's incredible."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,GalacticCatt,2,Wed Apr 8 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"It's your least favorite because it isn't as heavy? Doesn't really make sense honestly.  To me, it's the number one song that shows Tilian's assimilation with the band's style. It showcases his range and incredible vocal ability, incorporates his previous style that everyone loved him for, and just absolutely fits the DGD mold that blows a lot of the previous songs out of the water.   I don't even think I have to mention how killer the chorus is. This song is too good."
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Troy_Davis,4,Mon Apr 6 12:58:39 2015 UTC,I don't think he didn't like it because it wasn't heavy. He was just saying that it wasn't in the category of being one of their heavier songs or one of the more DGD funk style songs.
dancegavindance,31m5bd,Ageha-Yoshina,1 point,Mon Apr 6 15:39:32 2015 UTC,"I posted this comment on another thread:  For all of you guys (like me) who absolutely love Variation, check out Tilian's demo of Exfoliator with Saosin.

Preface: I understand I'm attaching meaning here that wasn't probably intended... BUT. This song lyrically just makes me thing of Reddit in general. The picture I see of a 20-something middle class suburban dude (I'll keep hiding in this cul de sac) who just quotes memes ""take my money..."" and referencing the other themes like gone wild (The picture I like it... or any of the references to taking off clothes etc.). Also, the circlejerk of pretty much every subreddit where you attach meaning and worth to upvotes etc. It's also the epitome of instant gratification.    Just putting that out there."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,3,Wed Apr 8 15:24:01 2015 UTC,"Haha ""we all came here just to fap"", I can dig it.  I think cul de sac is more of a metaphor for ""dead-end"" (literally what it means), than for a literal suburban neighborhood. Pearson probably intended to paint a picture where both meanings were applicable though. Somebody who becomes so attached to the past, and so hooked on instant gratification (drugs, sex, validation through social media, etc) that they can't move forward in life."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,26,Sun Apr 12 07:14:35 2015 UTC,I think my favorite thing about this album is that they've mixed all the sounds of their previous albums. Definitely can feel vibes from each record pop out on this one.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,HelloDepression,22,Sun Apr 5 21:35:24 2015 UTC,"Okay. I've listened hard to Variation, like, a lot today; couple times with a decent pair of sound cancelling headphones and a couple in in my car, and I'm PRETTY FUCKING SURE that the chorus is Mess, Tillian AND Swan! It's easy to pick out Tillian and Mess but Swans is just lower and more subtle."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,HelloDepression,5,Mon Apr 6 07:16:16 2015 UTC,That's what I thought! But I assumed that everyone else must have known something I didn't
dancegavindance,31k1p9,HelloDepression,21,Mon Apr 6 09:02:17 2015 UTC,I haven't heard the album yet and every comment here is killing the hell out of me.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,WeastCoast,4,Sun Apr 5 22:16:32 2015 UTC,Same here aha. Just the three singles. I'm hoping to wait until my physical copy arrives.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,WeirdPlane,2,Sun Apr 5 22:40:37 2015 UTC,I can only buy the physical when I see them on the 28th of this month. Otherwise I have to wait 9 days :( I don't think I can make it
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,4,Sun Apr 5 22:44:31 2015 UTC,I pre-ordered and I'm in the UK. Could be a month for me. :'(
dancegavindance,31k1p9,SourMgk,5,Sun Apr 5 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"Look on the bright side, they'll be officially released in 9 days on YouTube."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,5,Sun Apr 5 22:55:35 2015 UTC,True dat!
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JordanLorenz,2,Sun Apr 5 23:29:29 2015 UTC,When a Rise record leaks they normally put it up a few days early. I think when the OM&M album leaked they uploaded it the next day.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,4,Tue Apr 7 05:00:19 2015 UTC,The full thing is on Spotify  Source: That's how I'm listening to it  Edit: I'm stupid and didn't realize this is a week old...
dancegavindance,31k1p9,DavidR525,16,Tue Apr 14 17:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'm half way through the album, but I just want to listen to Shark Dad on repeat. I'm so damn happy."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,SourMgk,16,Sun Apr 5 21:37:08 2015 UTC,Strawberry and Eagles vs Crows are beautiful.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,12,Sun Apr 5 21:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. Eagles Vs. Crows is awesome. So far my favorite Mess lyrics.   This album is ridiculous. I was hoping that Secret Band would end up influencing their style, and I think IG has a lot more intensity than their past few albums. I'm so giddy."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,teamBellsprout,9,Sun Apr 5 21:58:29 2015 UTC,The heavy parts in Awkward are so SB.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,BrianTheBean,3,Mon Apr 6 04:21:17 2015 UTC,I feel like Shark Dad is pretty Secret Band too.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,mazalthan,4,Mon Apr 6 06:16:14 2015 UTC,Shark Dad felt like Secret Band featuring Tilian to me. Which is a very good thing
dancegavindance,31k1p9,DanceAlexDance93,5,Mon Apr 6 18:49:46 2015 UTC,I haven't heard a lot of Secret Band but I guess I need to change that.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,RimShimp,2,Sun Apr 5 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"Dude listen to the LP, it's some of the best stuff from those musicians."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,virum,5,Sun Apr 5 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"That one part where the song completely changes tone (not sure the term for it) gives me the chills. First time I heard it, my jaw dropped.   Edit: that ""Shine in the moment"" part. Haha"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,mrblahblahblacksheep,2,Sun Apr 5 23:16:18 2015 UTC,"DGD does this better than almost any band out there right now. ""We Own the Night"" is proof of this.  I think you're referring to the tempo change though (when it slows down). I might be wrong though haha"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,lukeenukem,14,Tue Apr 7 15:50:18 2015 UTC,Tillian on variation.... Holy fuck
dancegavindance,31k1p9,lukeenukem,13,Sun Apr 5 22:33:55 2015 UTC,One of the best songs Dance Gavin Dance has ever made. Without question.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Bowlermicah,3,Mon Apr 6 00:10:53 2015 UTC,Dare I say...THE best...?
dancegavindance,31k1p9,lukeenukem,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:43:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's way too early to say that. The song is fucking amazing, but the album hasn't even released yet. Only time will tell."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Roxas13x,2,Tue Apr 7 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"I just listened to Variation and my first thought was ""Wow"". It was intense in a very different and great way."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,14,Tue Apr 7 04:59:25 2015 UTC,I love this album but if I had to say one thing I would like a little less tilian and a little more Jon.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Roxas13x,14,Mon Apr 6 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, this was a bit of a pain in the ass but here's the lyrics! Enjoy! I certainly know I am.  http://pastebin.com/ihD6tBk0"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,go_bwaaah,2,Mon Apr 6 08:04:36 2015 UTC,"The things that you do with your attitude  I’m awkward, I’m chipper, I’m random dude  The picture, I like it, so don’t be rude  We all came here just to fap   Beautiful."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Roxas13x,5,Tue Apr 7 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"I love the way that he says ""I'm random dude"" on this song."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,dancejoshdance,2,Wed Apr 8 03:17:30 2015 UTC,"Just read through these while listening, thanks so much. Variation and Lost back to back are insane, and close out the album on a more serious note than I can ever think of from them."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,dancejoshdance,3,Tue Apr 7 19:15:43 2015 UTC,"No problem!  It seems like ""Lost"" isn't getting a lot of love on here, personally it's one of my favorites off the album.  I agree with you tho, both of those songs back to back, pure gold."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,teamBellsprout,11,Wed Apr 8 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I'll be the one to mention how absolutely depressing Something New is. When I read those lyrics as I went with the song I cried; the funky part changed became melancholy for me. When Tilian says his lines over Jon ""I never loved you, Stay the hell out of my way"" I was just crushed somehow. I feel like the speaker contemplates suicide or is cheating etc. I also think it leads a story into On the Run which is obviously about a relationship ending or cheating. Anyway, it was the most emotional song for me followed by Lost and Legend."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,dancejoshdance,5,Mon Apr 6 02:44:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool how they mixed a poppy sounding song with sad lyrics. Tilian is good at writing sadder songs like that, look at Pussy Vultures for example which hits home while still feeling like an energetic and fun song."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JSBUCK,2,Mon Apr 6 21:27:05 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. I forgot how much that song can hit the feels.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,rickman4L,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:05:54 2015 UTC,"""Nah, I don't do that anymore"" is my new favorite Mess line solely because of how much emotion the delivery conveys."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,xarahn,2,Wed Apr 8 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"And the follow up ""no people just places I adore"" hits me in the feels every time"

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jimmy-DeLaney,7,Mon Apr 6 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Post it to the sub when you do man, I'd love to see it!"

dancegavindance,31k1p9,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Mon Apr 6 01:00:00 2015 UTC,Are you by chance writing tabs? I would love help learning these new songs. :D
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Roton7,3,Wed Apr 8 16:42:29 2015 UTC,I can write tabs for it but gonna have to be tomorrow going to see dance gavin dance tonight
dancegavindance,31k1p9,danceKevindance2,11,Wed Apr 15 15:16:38 2015 UTC,HOLY FUCK WILL'S RAP ON EAGLE VS. CROW GOES FUCKING HARD!
dancegavindance,31k1p9,caseharts,4,Mon Apr 6 07:14:10 2015 UTC,Followed immediately by Jon / Tilian / more Will all killing it together!
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,9,Mon Apr 6 13:23:36 2015 UTC,I remember reading in an interview that Awkward's intro sounded like J-pop.  I guess I love J-pop now.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,DanceAlexDance93,19,Mon Apr 6 00:21:40 2015 UTC,"if people were honest with themselves, everyone would love J-pop."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jimmy-DeLaney,5,Mon Apr 6 03:22:58 2015 UTC,Dood i thought I was the only one who thought that! Ur my hero and yes J-pop + DGD = mind destruction
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JordanLorenz,10,Mon Apr 6 02:59:03 2015 UTC,This is the album that we all knew Dance Gavin Dance could make with Tilian... and man did it not disappoint.

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Vomiting_Winter,7,Tue Apr 7 15:30:18 2015 UTC,Best album since deathstar
dancegavindance,31k1p9,manlysuperpanda,9,Mon Apr 6 00:38:06 2015 UTC,Sh every album since death star has been better than death star :) Jr different folks for different strokes. This is top 3 for me now
dancegavindance,31k1p9,worstseanna,6,Mon Apr 6 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"Haha I love the variation of tastes with this band's fanbase, IG is up there for me but deathstar is still my favorite I think."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Anivia_on_Fire,8,Mon Apr 6 21:51:26 2015 UTC,"Chills. It's expectional, dawg. Everything just melds together PERFECTLY! Plus it has Will's best rap to date."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,9,Mon Apr 6 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"He honestly needs to rap more in their future releases, do yall agree?"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,ztr2645,26,Mon Apr 6 02:56:51 2015 UTC,Today I was imagining a Will Swan rap project with a fusion of traditional electronic made hip-hop beats and Will playing funky guitar.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,SakiiLol,6,Mon Apr 6 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"This deserves wayyyy more upvotes than it has.  Maybe they could have a Secret Secret Band that is geared towards Wills raps and feature Tilian and Jon on a couple songs   edit: Just so you guys are aware, sometimes when I mean to sound sarcastic I don't.  That's not just a text issue either, it's a character flaw that I'm well aware of.  Basically what I'm saying is that that Secret Secret Band comment was suppose to be a joke.  But for real though if that happened irl I'd be down."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,McMugginson,3,Mon Apr 6 08:53:28 2015 UTC,"I would say that he should rap in more songs, but he should not rap MORE in more songs. or have one or two songs per album where there is a lot of rapping, not just a verse and short backing vocals.  I think a Variation style chorus with Will, Tilian, and Jon all doing vocals simultaneously/interchangeably  would be sick"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,thedeafpoliceman,5,Mon Apr 6 08:52:35 2015 UTC,"I think the reason they've kept Wills rapping to such a minimum in previous albums because it was more of a cool/funny sort of novelty and they didn't want to over do it. Now however, Wills rapping has gotten so good and so well blended with the songs, they're actually doing themselves a disservice by not having more of it."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,5,Mon Apr 6 21:08:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard any of the new IG tracks, just the three singles. How many songs off the new album does Will Swan rap in?"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Vomiting_Winter,4,Mon Apr 6 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, only one. But that one is fucking great. I want a Will Swan rap album."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,3,Mon Apr 6 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"Didn't he say he was going to make one eventually? I don't listen to rap, but I would if Will Swan put out an EP or something, the few parts he has in songs are glorious."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,fateislosthope,2,Mon Apr 6 05:19:01 2015 UTC,Especially if he plays guitar in all of his rap songs hnggggg
dancegavindance,31k1p9,gl0ryus,3,Mon Apr 6 21:25:16 2015 UTC,This. As soon as will starts to rap I turn my volume up in my car and the bass nearly shatters the windows of my car.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,8,Mon Apr 6 01:41:22 2015 UTC,"I have to point out when Tillian and Jon sing/scream at the same time, something about gives me chills. This album is amazing!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,10,Mon Apr 6 01:13:42 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, I actually begun to get pretty emotional near the end of the final track, Lost"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,LMKurosu,7,Mon Apr 6 01:22:47 2015 UTC,Variation is one of the best songs they've made. So good.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jimmy-DeLaney,7,Mon Apr 6 03:11:41 2015 UTC,Guys. They have another album after this. Imagine what that will bring. My head will probably explode...

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,6,Mon Apr 6 15:33:17 2015 UTC,Haha yeah they have a contract with rise that says they are doing at least one more album with them.  Probs happen around october 2016 if i had to estimate
dancegavindance,31k1p9,manlysuperpanda,6,Mon Apr 6 16:08:31 2015 UTC,Awkward... That breakdown holy fuck

dancegavindance,31k1p9,JSBUCK,16,Mon Apr 6 22:01:32 2015 UTC,Am i the only one that thinks all 3 singles are the weakest songs off the album?  I cried twice while listening to the other 9. It leaked while i was in my car driving from st louis to Rolla (2 hr drive) at 12:30 am. And I listened to every new song twice on the way back.  The whole journey back was euphoric.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JabroniBozo,8,Sun Apr 5 22:30:59 2015 UTC,That's how I felt with Acceptance Speech! The singles were the songs I liked the least.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Baconturtlekid,2,Sun Apr 5 22:41:56 2015 UTC,I don't even remember what the singles off AS were
dancegavindance,31k1p9,musicry,7,Sun Apr 5 23:31:14 2015 UTC,Acceptance Speech and Robot 4. Both great songs but not as great as the rest of the album.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,erclpz,3,Sun Apr 5 23:34:34 2015 UTC,and Jesus H. Macy I believe
dancegavindance,31k1p9,ProfCereal,3,Mon Apr 6 00:49:39 2015 UTC,Yeah that was just before the whole album as well.

dancegavindance,31k1p9,turtlegiraffecat,2,Mon Apr 6 01:49:11 2015 UTC,"That album had the complete opposite effect on me, the only tracks I fully enjoyed at the time of release were the singles, as well as Death of the Robot. The rest of that album was a struggle but in present day I'm now able to enjoy the album in its entirety"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,xestrm,7,Mon Apr 6 04:36:43 2015 UTC,"That's how DGD rolls, they always release the weakest first. But I thought We Own the Night was incredible nonetheless."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,caseharts,9,Mon Apr 6 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"""We Own The Night"" definitely still stands out as a great track."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JabroniBozo,4,Mon Apr 6 05:43:30 2015 UTC,We own the night remains one of my favorite tracks on an overall incredible album!

dancegavindance,31k1p9,strawberrypumpkinpt2,6,Mon Apr 6 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"I love this album so much! First listen, it didn't feel so dgd to me. A few more listens, and holy shit. It's so good! I hope they stick with Tilian for a long time because I like where this is heading. Favorites: The Cuddler, Awkward, Eagles Vs Crows. Least Favorites but still pretty good: Shark Dad. I dunno, it kinda hit the ear wrong at first, and now I'm in love with it!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,manlysuperpanda,7,Mon Apr 6 04:25:18 2015 UTC,"Ugh so good, currently my favorites are Awkward, Eagle Vs Crows, and Variation!"

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Chromus23,11,Tue Apr 7 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"I was so glad On the Run ended up being the weakest song of Instant Gratification. I wasn't a huge fan and it kinda turned off my excitement for the new album since it sounded a lot like something  the other ""Rise"" bands would come up with. Either way I preordered the album and once they released We Own the Night I was glad I did. Yesterday I bought the album at their Boardwalk show at Sacramento and listened to it three times on the ride back home. Top tracks so far are Eagles vs Crows, Variation and Death of a Strawberry. But overall, quality work from DGD. Can't wait till my vinyl copy gets in :3"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Extreme-Enigma,2,Sun Apr 5 23:07:46 2015 UTC,"Those were my exact fears, too. I preordered the new album ASAP when it came out, but I was worried after hearing On the Run. Now after hearing the other singles I'm excited"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,njme1,17,Mon Apr 6 04:30:22 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda late to the party, so this will probably get buried, but whatever. One major thing I noticed about this album is how its title relates more strongly to the content than most other DGD albums. You see, ""Instant Gratification"" is a psychological term used to label satisfaction gained from something impulsive, immediate, or, well, instant. Pop music has a lot of these qualities, and is usually considered to be not-very-challenging, more immediate or predictable listening (no, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, and there are certainly exceptions within the genre -- pop is not a bad thing, guys.). This release leans toward pop a lot more than previous ones, what with Tilian's poppy vocal stylings and lyrics, plus the somewhat more chorus-centric song structures, so the songs themselves are more instantly gratifying. Hence the name, Instant Gratification.  I didn't see this put to words anywhere else, so let me know if I'm just stating the obvious."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,philtothetop,4,Mon Apr 6 03:00:03 2015 UTC,"This forms up how I've felt about the album so far, it seems to favor a poppier sound with easier songwriting in some of the songs, which would be bad if it didn't sound like DGD. However it has that DGD twist and weirdness and feel on every song which still makes it a quality DGD release for me. In very impressed with this album and I'm glad that as a band they can try new things/things new to them and still sound amazing in every way"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,DavidR525,2,Mon Apr 6 21:21:38 2015 UTC,I think you're overanalyzing. How i this more poppy than other work by DGD?
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Pizzaplanet420,7,Mon Apr 6 21:08:11 2015 UTC,"Tilian's cleans are a lot more prominently featured on this release than Jon's screams, and most of the songs have a more straightforward verse-chorus-verse structure than on past releases. The Happiness-esque funk vibes are also very prominent on IG.  That isn't to say I don't like the new album, because I really love IG so far. It does a lot of things that DGD hasn't done in the past; it has some great clean hooks, Jon's screams are even better than on AS, and the rest of the band is equally strong. I really think this could be DGD's breakthrough album that gets them big in the scene, because they've improved on both the poppy and heavy ends of the spectrum and this release is a little more accessible than past ones. So far IG is shaping up to be one of my favorite DGD releases, if not THE favorite."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,berniamacattack,5,Mon Apr 6 22:49:40 2015 UTC,It lived up to the hype Mahe sure you guys buy it don't be cheap.  Support the band's you care for.  If your in this sub. This is one for sure.  They never going to be rich probably so hook them up.  Also dgd put up more bundkes I want the sweat shirt
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Baconturtlekid,6,Mon Apr 6 00:58:47 2015 UTC,That chorus on Variation though...
dancegavindance,31k1p9,berniamacattack,6,Mon Apr 6 01:19:38 2015 UTC,Big fan of the Mr. Mime line in Strawberry.  Helps that it's one of the 3 or so best tracks on the album
dancegavindance,31k1p9,beachdude42,5,Mon Apr 6 02:30:13 2015 UTC,"Hello Mr. Mime, hello medicine!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,4,Mon Apr 6 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard the new album yet but I just wanted to say, it's nice hearing that Instant Gratification seems to be bringing the fanbase closer together as opposed to the effect other albums seemed to have had.  We Own the Night is probably my favorite out of the three singles released so far. Kinda wish it was a little longer in length though   Edit: Holy crappers I just listened to Eagle vs. Crows, and Will Swan sounds nothing short of amazing! It's now tied with We Own the Night as my favorite track so far!  Edit-Edit: Just heard the other eight tracks! They're all really fantastic! My favorites are probably We Own the Night, Something New, Awkward and Eagle vs. Crows. This might be presumptuous of me to say but I think Instant Gratification is my favorite album by DGD!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,5,Mon Apr 6 04:32:04 2015 UTC,Tilian brings his Tides of Man voice on Shark Dad and Legend it's perfect
dancegavindance,31k1p9,beachdude42,5,Mon Apr 6 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly I love it all! I couldn't really get into DBM2 or AS, so I'm glad to be able to enjoy DGD again. Everyone seems to mesh really well. Instrumentals are amazing, Tilian really shines, and Jon seems stronger than ever. I think my favorite track is Variation, closely followed by Death of a Strawberry, Awkward, and Eagles vs Crows all tied for second."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,5,Mon Apr 6 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Eagle Vs Crows is by far my favorite right now, but with every DGD album my favorite changes every week or two. Can't wait to listen to this for months (Years?) to come."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Bowlermicah,3,Sun Apr 5 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"This is by far my favorite DGD release, there isn't a single song I dislike. I think ""We Own The Night,"" ""Variation,"" and ""Eagle vs. Crows"" are my favorites so far, but that will probably change."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,DeIiriumTrigger,5,Sun Apr 5 22:07:24 2015 UTC,I have preordered mine but I'd love to have a FLAC download somwhere instead of mp3 files
dancegavindance,31k1p9,ConvolutedBoy,2,Sun Apr 5 23:43:04 2015 UTC,Just rip it off the CD
dancegavindance,31k1p9,mazalthan,4,Mon Apr 6 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"I love this album, so far I can't really say it sounds like any of their previous albums except maybe acceptance speech and happiness. But my favorite songs are Awkward and Eagle vs Crows."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,go_bwaaah,4,Sun Apr 5 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"After listening to the album for almost the entirety of yesterday, I'm just now realizing that Will Swan sings on more parts than the chorus to Something New (I think)  Is it Tillian or Will singing the intro to Awkward?"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,uniquerabbitturd,3,Mon Apr 6 17:21:38 2015 UTC,Will Swan only Sang it live. And Tilian sings the intro to awkward
dancegavindance,31k1p9,HangMeDry,6,Mon Apr 6 17:32:15 2015 UTC,Hm. Well I like his lower-octave voice a lot
dancegavindance,31k1p9,chozn1,4,Mon Apr 6 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"Despite being their least heavy album, and also the one that hews closest to traditional verse/chorus/bridge structure... these guys really nailed a more streamlined sound. Even the token Will Swan rap verse flows well within its song. Another solid listen, and a clear step up from Acceptance Speech."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jackbluesoup,8,Mon Apr 6 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"I would not agree that this is their ""least heavy album,"" Happiness and even DBM2 are just as pop-y. Will has even said that the heaviest song they've written is Shark Dad."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,5,Mon Apr 6 18:29:57 2015 UTC,"Also Awkward and Lost and Variation, all much heavier than anything on Acceptance Speech, with the exception of Demo Team (Carve Optional)."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jackbluesoup,3,Mon Apr 6 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough... to me it's their most poppy, but that's not a bad thing at all. It's a great album."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,2,Mon Apr 6 19:21:06 2015 UTC,Oh it's definitely pop-y! It's one of their best. Versatility is their strong suit.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Jackbluesoup,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"For once, I feel like a band said it was going to be heavier and catchier and came through. Tilian's melodies are straight fire on this album."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Bowlermicah,3,Tue Apr 7 13:18:21 2015 UTC,Shark Dad is one of the craziest things DGD has put out.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Husky127,4,Tue Apr 7 05:37:07 2015 UTC,"Notable favorite parts of the album:   ""Something New"" second verse ""Stroke God, Millionaire"" opening ""The Cuddler"" when Tilian comes in for the first time ""We Own the Night"" when the tempo slows down ""Awkward"" chorus   These are all I can think of right now. 9/10 album for me; very happy with this release and for the band in general. Seeing them last Friday was a dream come true, and I hope to see them more this summer/fall."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Bowlermicah,6,Tue Apr 7 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"This album is perfect. Multiple times a song, there are those ""holy fuck, that was amazing"" moments."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,chozn1,2,Mon Apr 6 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yes! I got that same feeling throughout my listens. Especially when you think you know where a song is going, and then it just U-Turns in a completely different direction."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,TotesMessenger,4,Mon Apr 6 19:36:15 2015 UTC,Awkward was so damn good.  Zac should just rejoin the band already.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,BurtBacarat,5,Wed Apr 8 14:38:47 2015 UTC,Does the intro to Eagle vs Crows remind anyone else of Pounce Bounce?
dancegavindance,31k1p9,njme1,3,Wed Apr 8 20:30:11 2015 UTC,Pounce Bounce Pt. 2!!!!! ahaha yah i recognized it after listing to both songs.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,vancha22,5,Wed Apr 8 22:49:24 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely late to this discussion. I'm a huge fan and 2 days ago I just realized they put out this album. I'm a fucking idiot. Needless to say, this is an amazing album and Tillian has a voice of gold! This is slowly becoming my favorite album of theirs. Is it wrong that I think the chorus of ""The Cuddler"" is one of the catchiest things I have ever heard? This album kills and more people should be hearing this!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,ChildishGambeanbro,7,Fri Jun 5 04:48:33 2015 UTC,"Instrumentally, this blows the last album away. Production sounds top notch. Mess seems to sound better and better with every album they put out. Lyrics are awesome as well. My only issue with it is that I was hoping Tilians vocals would be a little different since they hinted at it, more like a Tides of Man feel. I feel like he kind of sounds like micheal bolton at times, too. I dont think there will ever be a day where I dont wish for Kurt Travis back on vocals. I think if he was the clean on this album, it could rival Happiness."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,StepOsets,4,Mon Apr 6 06:18:51 2015 UTC,"I'm loving this album as well too. But what you have said really hits the nail on the head for me. I think Tilian has done a great job, and I don't want to rub people the wrong way here. But Happiness is my favorite DGD, and I just can't help but think as to how the album would have panned out with Kurt (Awkward, The Cuddle and Death of a Strawberry commmonn - i cant be the only on thinking this). This album though would have to be a second favorite of mine already, and if there was one that could attempt to dethrone Happiness, it could be this one.   Probably doesn't add much in peoples mind but just my 2 cents. Seeing them live in May. Cant wait !"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Beasty_Drummer,3,Mon Apr 6 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"I love Tilian and think he fits well with the band, but man do I miss Kurt.  Happiness is my least favorite album but I agree that it would be interesting to see what Kurt would've come up with on this album."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,captngiveafawk,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm glad im not the only one that thought what I did about Kurt being on this album. But I dont think this album could have happened without DTMBII and Acceptance Speech. Life is filled with compromises.   Just throwing this out to the wind. Kurt on We Own the Night. Oh my oh my...   But i do love ALLB. I have both worlds. They can co-exist.  Edit: I still can't help but think how strong this album would be if Kurt was on it. I feel like it is written for him!"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,JSBUCK,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:04:43 2015 UTC,"Will did say in an interview that he knows how to write for Tillian now, so if Kurt was in the band he probably would've written a whole different album haha"
dancegavindance,31k1p9,synthemerc,2,Mon Apr 6 23:16:27 2015 UTC,I did listen to that interview too. I do feel like there are elements of both Tilian and Kurt's range that is similar and overlaps. Maybe I'm trying too hard to try and compare this to Happiness and Deathstar.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,rickman4L,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:20:49 2015 UTC,"People asking for Kurt on this album... Even if the instruments were the same, the melodies would be completely different. Tilian has a much more pop oriented lyric style and delivery. This would sound completely different."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,rickman4L,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:21:49 2015 UTC,"Same if Jonny were to sing it, it'd be interesting to hear what they'd come up with. But these instrumentals were written for Tilian so it'd probably sound best how it is."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Dblntspy,2,Tue Apr 7 15:37:55 2015 UTC,"If someone like Tilian wrote melodies for Jonny, I think he could be successful again, but he has long passed his prime."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Vomiting_Winter,2,Tue Apr 7 15:44:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly!!! Like, I almost get bummed out listening to it just because I cant stop thinking about how awesome it would be with Kurt. I also felt this way about the last album. The only song I still listen to from that is SSP3. Happiness in my favorite DGD, as well."

Still read on my computer but the case under the CD had two huge cuts/scratches that scratched the CD.    I definitely wasn't Instantly Gratified.

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,3,Mon Apr 13 23:52:14 2015 UTC,"When I listened to the preview that was leaked, I was a bit skeptical about this album, especially since On The Run didn't feel very DGD to me. Then We Own The Night came out, and I was like, ""Holy shit that was good."" It felt like Tree Village pt 2 for me.  Then Stroke God was released and I was like, ""HOLY SHIT that was GOOD!""  Then Eagles vs. Crows came out and I got chills all over.  Something New felt more like Something Old in the sense that I felt comfortable listening to it, and moved it right away.   On The Run grow on me. I'm still iffy about   Shark Dad. Easily skippable for me at least.   Awkward was strangely good, and I loved that ending breakdown.   The Jiggler pt 2 was also really good and very DGD.   Legend reminds me soo much of Deathstar with its transition to Jon's part.  Death of a Strawberry had a very soothing feel to it and it was just a beautiful song.  Don't even get me started on Variation! The Mess/Pearson/Swan vocal combo makes me fuzzy inside.   Lost is the perfect closer and it feels like a full complete song.  This album defines DGD. I felt like AS was the transition/experimental album since they got a new singer with a new vocal range. It was a hit and miss for me, and I had doubts for IG, but it's easily up there in my top 3. I'm sorry, but Happiness and DBMII are still better in my opinion. IG is just as good though."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,iBeProFinn,3,Tue Apr 14 07:43:06 2015 UTC,Does anyone else think of Metroid when they hear Eagles vs. Crows? Right before Swans rap?
dancegavindance,31k1p9,andreasmiles23,3,Thu Apr 16 00:37:02 2015 UTC,its crazy i remember listening to these guys back in high school and with that sound at the time you figure you would grow out of it. nope. nope nope. dgd has always made crazy albums and i really dig the fuck out of this one. also will swan raps are always on point.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,uniquerabbitturd,3,Fri Apr 17 01:47:02 2015 UTC,I can't even single out a song to talk about because I love them all... This album is just incredible!
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,3,Sun Apr 5 22:19:07 2015 UTC,I can literally listen to Eagles vs Crows on repeat. Also Something New is also another top choice for my favorite song. Altogether I think the album really flows and Tillian and Jon melt together perfectly with instrumentals throughout the whole album.
dancegavindance,31k1p9,sawhney_rusted,3,Sun Apr 5 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"I remember vividly when acceptance speech came out, and I heard ""Strawberry Swisher pt.3"" for the first time, it was a magical feeling. I'm getting that feeling with this whole record. Holy fuck it is so good."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,thePigWithAbat,3,Mon Apr 6 07:35:34 2015 UTC,The intro to Awkward is great and Tilian's vocals with Mess's unclean in the chorus is one of my favorites. This album was really solid. I'm gonna give it time before I say it's officially my favorite (which may be the case).
dancegavindance,31k1p9,enderquinn,3,Mon Apr 6 09:48:21 2015 UTC,I really hope there's a Death of a Strawberry pt2 on dgd8

I'm just hoping whatever they do next has more rapping because Will Swan isn't even a human being, and Eagle vs Crows is completely the noodlie-bootily"

dancegavindance,31k1p9,Runacs,3,Tue Apr 7 07:14:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly never used to be a fan of the Strawberry songs. It was back when all I wanted was Jonny and Mess, I wasn't digging Happiness. Then I realized that Matt and Will are easily the real backbone of DGD, so I shut my face and allowed my face to be melted by the wicked instrumentals on Happiness."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,3,Tue Apr 7 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"This album is just fantastic overall. I was skeptical on how it would turn out until Stroke God was released. I love how much of a Tides of Man feel Legend has, it took blew me away initially. And don't get me started on Variations. The guitar in the intro combined with Tilian's voice gives me chill every time I hear it."
dancegavindance,31k1p9,Y_Machina,3,Tue Apr 7 18:21:36 2015 UTC,"There hasn't been a record like this in a while, that just hits me in the feels. I keep getting shivers down my spine throughout the album. Whether its the opening to ""Stroke"" the outro in ""On the Run"" the chorus in ""Variation"" or the bridge dealio in ""Something New""...I don't think this band has ever been this much in the zone. This is the potential I think everyone felt from DGD way back when, and they've really close to tapping it a couple times, but have been hindered by the lead vocalist roulette. No more. They've done it folks. This is by far the best DGD album to date."

This is my favorite release so far this year. Which means you beat out Modest Mouse's incredible Strangers to Ourselves AND Enter Shikari's The Mindsweep.   This is a feat, guys. Feel proud."

dancegavindance,31i62b,Roxas13x,5,Sun Apr 5 11:19:13 2015 UTC,"Imo it's just because of the harshness of the first minute and a half or so, the second half of the song isn't that bad. It's still far from my favourite song on the album though."
dancegavindance,31i62b,iamcarlbarker,10,Sun Apr 5 11:21:08 2015 UTC,I thought the harshness worked on Shark Dad and it was definitely better than the comparable Carve. It just sounded like Secret Band with extra funk which was OK.
dancegavindance,31i62b,Roxas13x,5,Sun Apr 5 14:38:57 2015 UTC,I think Carve would have been soo much better with different production. I cannot hear anything but a wall of sound in the beginning and it really dampers the song.
dancegavindance,31i62b,ktm57ktm57,3,Sun Apr 5 15:31:11 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly. It's hard to notice the tapping parts in the beginning of the song which is disappointing.

dancegavindance,31i62b,JoseE4L,7,Sun Apr 5 15:42:25 2015 UTC,Just want to give major props to Kris Crummett for the great production. It is only really after listening to this album that I realised how poor the production on AS was!
dancegavindance,31i62b,Extreme-Enigma,5,Sun Apr 5 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"Matt Malpass did a phenomenal job on Acceptance Speech, but the snare on a majority of the songs just sounds a bit too ""thuddy"" to me. Regardless, some of my favorite DGD tracks will forever reside on that record. IMHO though, Kris Krummet is where it's at. The man has mixed some other fantastic experimental and new-prog bands in the past few years i.e. all of the Closure in Moscow Records."
dancegavindance,31i62b,DanceAlexDance93,6,Sun Apr 5 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"Meh, personally I think the drums on AS are not that bad, but the bass can barely be heard and the guitars are ok, but definitely don't stand out as much as they do on the other records. That's just my opinion though!"

dancegavindance,31i62b,Roxas13x,7,Mon Apr 6 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"Just finished my first listen and I think this is the first DGD album that I didn't truly love after the first go. I liked it a lot, don't get me wrong, but it just feels a bit lacking from what I expect of a DGD album.  When Jonny got kicked the second time, I immediately wanted Tilian to be his replacement and was so happy when the rumors started and then it became official. He felt similar in enough ways for it work perfectly. But for whatever reason we didn't get the Tides of Man Tilian that belts out rugged vocals, much like what people love about Jonny. Having said all that, although I wanted the rougher Tilian, I still loved him on Acceptance Speech. This album though felt like the Tilian show, which to me doesn't work as well if we're not getting the Tides of Man, stronger front man Tilian style. I'm also extremely biased to Jon, so what I perceive as him having a lessened role probably has something to do with it. A lot of his parts also felt like they were mixed weird, giving them a muddy sound.  Aside from that, Will was right when he said that this is the weirdest, heaviest, and poppiest DGD album to date. But despite how weird and heavy this album got, it still felt really generic in terms of song structure--which I think is the main reason I'm not totally in love with the album yet, as DGD isn't really known for sticking to the generic song structure."
dancegavindance,31i62b,NotEthosLab,12,Sun Apr 5 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"I always felt ""generic"" was a poor adjective for vcvcbc song structure. It's more standard because it transcends pop music, it's a common device that doesn't detract from the music if executed correctly. Sorry, that has always been a pet peeve of mine, along with the use of pop as synonymous with ""bad"" music.  That being said, I think they pull off the pop and weirdness very well. Awkward is their straight up most accesible song next to Strawberry Swisher pt. 2 imo. Shark Dad actually was really interesting.. It grew on me as the song went on, but I loved the guitar work on it regardless since the preview.  Am I the only one who feels the front half of the album isn't necessarily weak, but that the first 4 tracks (which were also the one they released) pale in comparison to Shark Dad onward? When Variation and Legend came on I was extremely thrown in the best way possible, I didn't expect each song to go in the direction they went it and they pulled it off. I went into this album knowing Awkward would be my instant favorite. But after a few listens, Variation and Legend are definitely ear worms that seem to get better and better as I listen."
dancegavindance,31i62b,thePigWithAbat,5,Sun Apr 5 15:20:02 2015 UTC,That first paragraph is spot on. I'm stealing that from you next time someone complains about song structure
dancegavindance,31i62b,shmate4L,2,Sun Apr 5 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"I'm siding with suit-and-tie and saying ""generic"" is the only word that does it justice. This album just didn't stand out for me like the others did. Maybe I just don't like Tillian, maybe I'm growing bored of dgd, but I was so dissatisfied with instant gratification. And, personally, I feel like Awkward is the most guilty of being a very underwhelming song. It's the only dgd song where I actively noticed there being a breakdown. And the lyrics all throughout the album, man. They felt so predictable.   I'm probably just bitter in thinking that they don't have the same kind of spontaneity or groove like they did. I don't know."
dancegavindance,31i62b,stuckandglued,5,Mon Apr 6 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"I am going to need another proper listen before I say anything definitively, but what I will say is I felt like Acceptance Speech was catchier on first listen. Other than the three initial tracks they released (since I was already familiar with them), I'm having trouble pinpointing which songs had the best hooks or guitar work. Everything is just kind of blending together at the moment."
dancegavindance,31i62b,Brajio,2,Sun Apr 5 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you but I have to believe it's because I've played the dog shit out of WOTN and OTR.    I think I may be the only one who is in love with Shark Dad.  So brutal.   I'm finishing up my first listen and I haven't found a single bad moment of the album.    On another note, Will just like an instagram post of mine!"
dancegavindance,31i62b,JabroniBozo,2,Sun Apr 5 18:16:09 2015 UTC,"I think the generic song structure has to do with how often Tilian sings a chorus, etc. What makes up for it is the surprise factor from the interesting instrumental work."
dancegavindance,31i62b,Beasty_Drummer,2,Sun Apr 5 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"First impressions 1. We Own the Night 2. Awkward 3. The Cuddler 4. Eagle vs. Crows 5. On the Run 6. Death of a Strawberry 7. Something New 8. Legend 9. Variation 10. Stroke God, Millionaire 11. Shark Dad 12. Lost"

I can tell you one thing though, Wills rap on Eagle vs. Crows had me hit replay like 50 times lmao"
dancegavindance,31i62b,Sdnz0r,2,Sun Apr 5 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"After just a few full listens, I have to say this is probably my favorite DGD album. There's so many different layers and it's got everything that I love about them blended together perfectly. Everyone is just on point and sounds fantastic. I think I'm most impressed with how well Tilian and Jon's vocals mesh together. They just flow together so well and harmonize so perfectly.  It's really hard to pick a favorite song, as every single one has something that I really love. So I'm just gonna say it's AOTY."

Tilian, WOW I am really liking him with this band. Will is a fucking beast on the album, bringing some funk. Matt kills it on the drums like always, and Tim's bass is great. I can't put into words how much this band means to me. The fact that they are still making music, and it is still some of the best music I have ever listened to makes me so happy. FUCK YEAH!!!"

dancegavindance,31fu75,shmate4L,8,Sat Apr 4 18:09:06 2015 UTC,I'm surprised nobody has done this already.

It was a terrible kind of torture"
dancegavindance,31fu75,Ageha-Yoshina,3,Sat Apr 4 18:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not asking for leaks, I just wish if they were going to sell it on the 3rd, then send it to people who pre-ordered for the 3rd as well, and have your release for everybody else be the 14th, but this is just dumb because pre-ordering is supposed to mean instant access.  I'll definitely listen to it if you leak it, though."
dancegavindance,31fu75,xarahn,4,Sat Apr 4 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally understand. On dgds last stop on their last tour with Memphis May Fire in Chico, where I live, I ran into will swan at our farmers market that was going on right after the show and he said rise had just given them the ok to sell it since this is technically a release show. The next tour is a release tour, so take that how you will."

You knew full well when you preordered it you'd expect it on the 14th. If you preordered on iTunes, you get singles as they become available and if you preorder merchnow they ship on the 7th so you have a chance to get them early.

dancegavindance,31fx2l,Baconturtlekid,10,Sat Apr 4 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Stroke God's video acts as both a prequel and sequel. The time travel is what makes it such. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I believe it is some kind of paradox that makes this a plausible story.  Death of the Robot is where we start (duh): We have our Robot (who we're going to call Gavin for the sake of this post) and the oppressive, autocratic leader of Thug City, that bastard ass eyeborg dog (but we'll just call him Dog). Dog is a crazy animal, hungry with power and driven by a odd wish or dream to become something more or.. different. So Dog kidnaps Gavin and pull out his DNA core; that's like his heart, yo. And it's what makes him human. But, you know, then we see him get his core back, transform into some crazy robo-human-angel, fight that robot and tear up Dog's crazy propaganda, and build a ship to take the animals away from Thug City. The space flight, the shooting, Gavin's death (which, might I say, his core getting shot was never shown, did Dog get lucky, or did the DeathStar miss its mark?), and his termination message that always makes me just a little sad. Animals get to DtBM, and then robots come to invade.  Then, just like you explain, the war is happening in DtBM, and Bird travels through time (and presumably space), even falling through the air with Croc-asaur and Gavin at one point. Bird was Mona Lisa, they sat in the Happiness boat, and at one point were even in what I personally believe to be DtBM2. That quick scene with the white city with bright colored animals and hover cars zipping about? Is that the future, or past? Then Bird meets Dog, who's the one-eyed captain of a pirate ship, gives him the finger twice, and then accidentally drops him off at Thug City during their struggle for the time lever. Dog probably then took over Thug City from there, had his eye implanted, and started going crazy. Then our story starts over from there after Dog captures Gavin (again/for the first time)."

dancegavindance,31fx2l,oldnewstwist,4,Sun Apr 5 00:07:38 2015 UTC,I so agree with you
dancegavindance,31fx2l,HyperKenji,2,Sat Apr 4 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think the story starts over.  I'd bet anything that croc-asaur, duck, and swanye west, actually end up traveling through time to save Gavin just before he dies.  The white city where they smiled is totally dtbm2 (a utopia that arose from the remnants of the great battle, or preceded it, though I would assume the former)."
dancegavindance,31fx2l,oldnewstwist,2,Sun Apr 12 07:23:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. So you would say that, in the events of this particular story, the loop/paradox that would infinitely occur only happens once (twice? once?), and that Bird, Crocasaur and Swan go back and break the loop, and then the story would change? Or wouldn't that mean the war never happened, having been avoided; or maybe that things would go differently during the war with Gavin alive and fighting?"
dancegavindance,31fx2l,HyperKenji,2,Mon Apr 13 01:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that just about covers it haha. Personally I think it'd be pretty cool if by saving Gavin, they're able to bridge the gap between the animals (biology) and robots (science) and end the war peacefully, or eventually manage to prevent it entirely (after inadvertently causing it of course), and thus usher in a new era...sort of like the ending to Battlestar Galactica (""I was in a viper fight, but I'm alright""). The good gent who makes these fantastic videos needs to touch upon the lore of the Deathstar inhabitants though, as it seems their design was based off of the people from the cover of dtbm2. And, of course, if Gavin returns, it only makes sense that Dog (perhaps the terror of the Royal Ocean) does as well."
dancegavindance,31fx2l,TopherVee,5,Mon Apr 13 08:20:09 2015 UTC,"Also if you look past the statue of the presumably now deceased crocodile king you can see a carving in the top of the ""government"" building that depicts a star (the Robot with Human Hair after termination) above the planet with the space-arc that transported the remainder of the animals to this planet (home of Downtown Battle Mountain) as an homage to their deliverance/saving from Thug City."

In my opinion, yes. I would say that's fine. Reading the lyrics isn't damaging to the band in any way so I'd say it's ok."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,lazenbooby,2,Sat Apr 4 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, my bad. I guess I jumped the gun here, thank you though!"
dancegavindance,31gm9v,lazenbooby,3,Sat Apr 4 22:26:11 2015 UTC,It was an open question for the sub too so it's cool I guess.
dancegavindance,31gm9v,Roxas13x,0,Sat Apr 4 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm kinda confused how much this sub has changed in the last month. I know we've just gained about 100 subscribers in a week, but wow.  When I posted the sticky, everybody was agreeing and saying that leaks weren't welcome. The preview was reported 7 times after it had been up just 10 minutes, the community were just fantastic and I'm really thankful for that help.  Fast forward a month and suddenly everybody's asking for that guy to send them the mp3s. I dunno, I guess I'm kinda disappointed but we can't stop anybody that does that."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,BeggingForChange,8,Sat Apr 4 22:26:47 2015 UTC,I think the difference is the time span between the preview being leaked and the actual release date. Dgd has sold their cd already so people feel like that is reason enough for the album to be leaked and listened to. They'll still buy the album anyway because they are supportive but they want to listen to what they paid for.
dancegavindance,31gm9v,LBGW_experiment,8,Sat Apr 4 22:36:58 2015 UTC,"I guess I feel like since I have the album pre-ordered I'm not really hurting or taking anything away from the band if someone else who legitimately payed for the album shared the files with me.  Maybe I'm an entitled asshole, idk. But since they are selling the album, and I've already payed for it, I'm probably going to listen to it as soon as someone shares it."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,lazenbooby,4,Sat Apr 4 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I'm the dude who's offering to get a copy of the CD uploaded. Rise themselves gave DGD permission to sell IG starting yesterday and those lucky few who get to be here at the show should be able to help out those who couldn't be here. So I'm offering to help out my fellow DGD brothers when almost everyone has already preordered the stuff, they just wanna hear it since it's technically released and legally allowed to be.  Also, would I be allowed to make a self post saying I have the music uploaded, but not post directly to the link? Just pm the link to everyone who asks. That way those who want it can ask and it can have it's own separate post for those unaware."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,datspinda,2,Sun Apr 5 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm just stuck between a rock and a hard place right now man. You're not directly breaking our rules and yet on the other hand it is kinda... I even messaged Will on facebook because I thought he would have some advice haha.  On one hand a tonne of people asked you for the link, but also a few people reported it too. So not matter what I do somebody will be upset with me.  Even if the link isn't shared we would still be allowing the album to be pirated by allowing the post. If there was a way for people to prove that they had already preordered then I guess everybody could be happy.  I'm sorry man. It's just a shitty call for us to make and it's hard to say where the line should be drawn."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,HelloDepression,2,Sun Apr 5 06:58:27 2015 UTC,YOU! You da real MVP  ∗ ◕ ں ◕ ∗
dancegavindance,31gm9v,lazenbooby,3,Sun Apr 5 03:55:08 2015 UTC,"I think that now would be the perfect time for DGD to just drop their album. For the hardcore fans, 24 hours is enough to let the hype ferment from the people who bought the CD at the shows, and if they drop it now then there won't be any leaks* and we'll all be paying to get our fix. I know I would.  *I mean. Kind of. It'll be online."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,seekmystery,2,Sat Apr 4 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a weird situation. Take the preview for example, no one wanted that because it was without the band's consent or even awareness about until it started being posted everywhere. This situation is the band selling the CDs themselves two weeks earlier than normal. Since it's the band actually selling them, people feel like its not that shady as just posting an actual leak with no consent from the band or label. It makes that guilt less serious and desire more justified.   I imagine that when they sold them, they asked their fans to not release the music from the CD which is why that guy hasn't released the MP3s or anyone who currently owns it."
dancegavindance,31gm9v,rickman4L,2,Sat Apr 4 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"It makes that guilt less serious and desire more justified.   You're right, yeah. I dunno, maybe it's just me overthinking things. It's difficult finding where we should draw the line with it."

dancegavindance,31e97v,guccireddit,6,Sat Apr 4 06:01:45 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It's kind of an exclusive for the people who were there so if you weren't there, you shouldn't be able to listen to it until the 14th. That would make it a leak.

dancegavindance,31e97v,xarahn,3,Sat Apr 4 06:03:16 2015 UTC,"Right, it's a leak but it's not. I just hate the fact that since I live in Cleveland I can't see them to get it.

dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,11,Thu Apr 2 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! Mattias' style is a huge influence to me generally, but it definitely was the biggest inspiration for the video. I wanted to make it feel like it's tied into the DGD universe (with all the album covers etc) so it felt essential. Everything you see was physically drawn and animated by myself, but a number of the characters are either taken from or built upon using the designs on the albums (to re-enforce the DGD brand). I think the only communication I've ever had with Mattias is a tweet I once sent him saying how I admired his work. Hope that answers your question! Thanks for asking!"

dancegavindance,317qki,Flawgon,6,Fri Apr 3 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"Who writes the stories for these? The tie in between this and Death of the Robot really got me curious. They clearly take place in the same universe (kind of, depending on how they time travel works), and this gives a little back story as to how the purple bear ended up in the robot's world. Is this all stuff you came up with while listening to the music or does Jon/the band send you a summary of what you're animating? I really love what you're doing (your video for Medusa is what got me into Stolas) and I really appreciate you taking the time to answer us!"
dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,16,Thu Apr 2 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"I 'write' (aka scribble bullet points in a notebook) the stories! The band gave me much more direction (which I definitely wanted) with the meaning behind Death of the Robot. The whole idea of 'The Singularity' etc, which was discussed and incorporated into what happens.   However with this video I was given total creative freedom. I didn't actually know the lyrics until I read them in the videos description today, and still don't really know what the song's about. I started from the end verse, ""is there a god?"". I thought it would be cool for a character to travel back in time and meet god. That somehow changed (pretty early on actually) into Will Swan on the toilet. The rest of the story was completely influenced by the song from an instrumental standpoint. I knew that the fast guitar licks would be a montage of time-travelling, and the bridge would be the duck sinking underwater, because that's what the sound of those parts reminded me of! Just needed to find a way of linking them together.  In terms of creating a universe, small things just hit me at random points. I think the inclusion of the bad guy from the Death of the Robot video wasn't an instantaneous thought. I knew there was going to be a pirate ship, but when I made the link between a pirate's eyepatch and the Dog's robo-eye it just seemed like a opportunity to use him. Thank you for your question! I'm stoked you liked it! Releasing the video is the best part of the process, so it's a joy to be able to answer people who are interested :)"

Actually, now I think of it, I think Mt Mograph has a tutorial on rigging a character, that's the best first step! Good luck man!"

dancegavindance,317qki,Dr_lawlz,3,Fri Apr 3 00:15:57 2015 UTC,What did you use to make this video? I'm pretty familiar with After Effects so I viewed the whole video wondering how you did some of the things you did
dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,5,Fri Apr 3 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I used! All the drawings were done in Photoshop, and then imported into After Effects for animating. I hated that program at first but have come to love it. Let me know if you want to know any technical details/details in specific!"
dancegavindance,317qki,Dr_lawlz,2,Fri Apr 3 01:19:54 2015 UTC,"I would love to know some details. From the looks of it, it seems use used that puppet pin tool for the movements right? It's some really incredible animating"
dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,1 point,Fri Apr 3 13:30:20 2015 UTC,"You're right! For the main duck, before his skin peeled off, to bend and move his arms and beak I had to use the  puppet pin tool. A lot of the characters in the intro fight scene use this also. It's a great tool, but it has it's limits. Sometimes it doesn't bend quite right etc. Ultimately, I prefer the style of animation for the ducks skeleton. Each part of him is drawn separately (face, top beak, lower beak, eyebrows, eye, pupil, limbs, body etc etc) and that gives me much more creative freedom as nothing is being distorted and parenting the different layers is much easier. I don't feel like I'm doing a great job of explaining, it's perhaps one of those things that's better to show than explain. But it is a good tool. The guy who did the lyric video for 'On the Run' uses it throughout the whole thing in a very effective way! In terms of animating a character, I normally start with the limbs, and build on up from there! The face is the most important part though, sometimes I won't know how it really looks until I've done that. The easiest way of doing it, is as simple as just pulling the expression yourself whilst you're creating it on screen. Sounds odd, but it works!"
dancegavindance,317qki,Dr_lawlz,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:37:36 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks for the reply! Sorry I'm replying late but I have one more question. I noticed you had many 3D objects throughout the video like the Activate button, the bookshelf, the ship, and Im not completely sure if you did the death of the robot video but the buildings in that video were 3d and it was a really dope effect. How did you do it?"
dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:47:28 2015 UTC,"That's okay! So for the Death of the Robot, I used a plugin called 'Element' created by Video Co-Pilot. It allows you to import and use 3D files. I didn't really enjoy using this plugin much for the video SO  for Stroke God, the buildings were created by turning 2D images on their axis to create a 3D building. It's more cartoony and I prefer it to Element. The ship was also done this way, but was a little more complicated as it's bigger, has a different shape than just a rectangle etc and had different compartments/levels. A part of it the process, is if you can't make it 100% correct, then do enough to trick the camera into making it look like it's 100% correct. Works just as well, which segways into the next bit.. Because the 'activate' button is cylindrical, and the technique above is preferable for blockier shapes, I used two layers, the circle of the button which acts as the surface, and then there is a rectangle that is rotated on it's x axis and placed underneath the button to act as it's width/base. Placing the camera in the right place makes it look like it is fully 3D whereas really, if you're looking at it from the side it's more of a T shape(top of the T being the surface, and the length of the T being the buttons width). Does that makes sense?"
dancegavindance,317qki,Dr_lawlz,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:26:10 2015 UTC,"That does make sense! You're pretty clever with this stuff :D I used to use Element for all my 3D stuff but looking at your method, it seems a lot cooler and I like the way it looks. What are your thoughts on the Ray Traced 3D feature in After Effects? If I remember correctly it lets you add curvature. Also, do you use the built in motion blur in AE or do you use RSMB? And what do you use for Easing? I use ease and wizz because it's really simple. Btw, I just found out you were the one who made the music video for Connector by A Lot Like Birds... you have no idea how much I love that music video! It's honestly my favorite music video ever because it really makes you feel like you're there even without 3D glasses or anything. So really nice job on that! ^"
dancegavindance,317qki,johnmichaelhowe,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"Both are good for different styles! There's certainly a lot I couldn't achieve if I only ever used the technique I did in Stroke God. It's also kind of a matter of taste. Right now I feel like the 3D animation space is completely over-saturated, so I don't like to use element so much for that reason.  To be honest, I actually haven't explored the world of Ray-Tracing yet! It's just something that hasn't crossed my path yet, and I completely forgot about.. So thank you for reminding me! I must incorporate that into a future project. I just use the motion blur settings in After Effects, that works well enough for me but I can see the perks of RSMB (adjusting the ammount etc). I personally don't have the plug-in, but it might be worth getting sometime! For easing, I use the graph editor. At first, I though it looked mind-bogingly confusing, however it's actually rather straight forward and very useful! Mt. MoGraph's script 'Motion' is great for some expressions in movement (bouncing, constant rotating) which I would recommend :)  Ah dude, thank you! That video was a big milestone for me, I really pushed myself to get that right! Hopefully didn't cause motion sickness haha!"

It’s got probably the heaviest song we ever did, called “Shark Dad,” and some of the softest stuff, like “Death of the Strawberry,” and “Legend,” one of the catchiest songs we have ever done, and also the heavy, spook-style, epic screamo stuff. It goes all over the place in a way that none of our other records ever have.   Nice. Can't wait to hear all those 3!"

dancegavindance,30y638,dny-,3,Tue Mar 31 23:05:29 2015 UTC,I could never imagine that happening because of how big of a dick Jonny is. Unfortunately.
dancegavindance,30y638,AhTreyYou,3,Fri Apr 3 00:16:15 2015 UTC,"I could see it happening, Jonny doesn't have bad feelings towards the band as far as I know. Plus he would get to appear on an album and his fans would be happy."
dancegavindance,30y638,HelloDepression,3,Fri Apr 3 02:36:09 2015 UTC,"I want them to re-record Rock Solid with Tilian because during the ""conversation"" part at the bridge of the song, Tilian add's in his own song and that mixed up with Will's guitar playing is pure excellent. It's a version of the song that I always wished someone would mash up together or one that they would just re-record."

dancegavindance,30sz9m,coldjeanz,4,Tue Mar 31 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think it does. It's supremely dark for that album and the dissonant clean chords behind Kurt are really eerie.  I don't know, all the songs on happiness are great, but I feel like that song, and the song happiness, in particular, could've been the basis for an entirely new and mature sound for DGD. Both songs were super experimental and awesome for me. Then they got rid of Zach, picked Jonny back up, and went into safe mode for DBM 2."
dancegavindance,30sz9m,Mikeyswitz,2,Tue Mar 31 15:36:27 2015 UTC,Different tastes I guess. I would have probably stopped listening to DGD if the rest of their material mimicked Self Trepanation
dancegavindance,30sz9m,coldjeanz,2,Tue Mar 31 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"To each their own, either way I think a lot of people would love to see a return to the happiness sound."

dancegavindance,30sz9m,Delusions0fGrandeur,2,Mon Mar 30 20:10:10 2015 UTC,Jason Ellis recorded bass for this album? I always thought Ellis was a touring bassist and lodge did bass for every album except Acceptance Speech. Tim Ferrick recorded bass for that album and Instant Gratification
dancegavindance,30sz9m,Delusions0fGrandeur,2,Mon Mar 30 21:14:39 2015 UTC,I believe Eric left when Jon Mess did and came back with Jon. It says Ellis did bass on the Wikipedia article (not the most reliable source I know). I kinda just it's word for it.
dancegavindance,30sz9m,AhTreyYou,2,Mon Mar 30 21:23:01 2015 UTC,yeah i just checked that out too I am not saying youre wrong or anything its just I always thought ellis was a touring bassist and lodge came back to record bass but not tour with them. but who knows

dancegavindance,30sz9m,AhTreyYou,2,Mon Mar 30 21:29:43 2015 UTC,"It's true, Ellis recorded bass on Happiness and left soon after. Tim Ferrick replaced him in his first stint in DGD."
dancegavindance,30sz9m,Delusions0fGrandeur,2,Tue Mar 31 01:14:36 2015 UTC,so did ferrick record bass for DBMII also?
dancegavindance,30sz9m,HelloDepression,2,Tue Mar 31 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"No, he left after some touring and Jon Mess and Eric Lodge rejoined shortly after. Kurt, then got kicked out of the band and Jonny Craig rejoined and they recorded DBM2 together."

dancegavindance,30khrr,HelloDepression,3,Sat Mar 28 04:14:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, everyone :) My main problem is I haven't really found a unique style/theme to it. The font is plain, the colors are unsaturated, and the movement is identical to other lyric video makers. Thank you for bringing those things to my attention, I will try and fix it the best way I can."
dancegavindance,30khrr,Husky127,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:08:41 2015 UTC,What program are you using to do this? I've been interested in making my own lyric videos.
dancegavindance,30khrr,Husky127,2,Sat Mar 28 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"I used Hitfilm 2 Express. Personally its the cheapest alternative to after effects. I got it for free since they had a deal on it (sadly its not going on anymore), and it has so far been great to use. I would recommend trying it free (through a friendly pirate) to see if its up your alley. I hope to see some of your work in the future :)"

dancegavindance,30khrr,caseharts,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:22:50 2015 UTC,I tried to import fonts to the program but it wouldn't load them. That was going to be my first choice tho
dancegavindance,30khrr,rickman4L,2,Tue Mar 31 00:22:20 2015 UTC,"It's pretty cool, but I think you'll need to get a little more creative if you want it to be any different from all the existing lyric videos in this exact style"
