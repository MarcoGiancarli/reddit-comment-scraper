The challenge stopped becoming ""how can I get through this armor"", to ""where are the weak spots in this armor that I can exploit"". Between the shoulder plates and the cuirass was vulnerable because in order to have any range of movement in the Knight's arms there had to be a gap in these two pieces. These ""subwoofers"" block that space.  Your armpits are actually a really bad place to be stabbed. There are a lot of major arteries there that can sliced open.  What am I doing with my life?
