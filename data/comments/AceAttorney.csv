AceAttorney,3e0gr0,Segtend0,4,Tue Jul 21 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"Mine is the same as yours. I loved how they put in the original Cornered theme but with a small variation--there's a driving percussion beat in the T&T version that wasn't in the original. It's not very noticeable, but it is there. That small change kind of summed up Phoenix's character development across the series for me.   The original Cornered is very intense and also played during parts where you were figuratively walking the tightrope. It reflected Phoenix's utter trust in his clients and his determination to fight to the bitter end despite what a greenhorn he was. With the variation in T&T, we're taken back to that very first case and the beginning of his law career but the percussion adds a driving force to the theme. It represents the experience he's gained and how he can stand on his own now, without Mia, as a defense attorney.    I was hoping they'd throw another Cornered variation in DD but they didn't, which I think was a missed opportunity. It would've been great to put in Turnabout Reclaimed, for that final push at the end imo.  Man, I love the music in the Ace Attorney games. I could go on about it all day."
AceAttorney,3e0gr0,skilynn,4,Tue Jul 21 04:30:40 2015 UTC,"I don't have any specific answer, but any time I figure out the case before Phoenix does. When I find the critical contradiction and suddenly everything falls into place, it's a fantastic feeling. Sure, it's fun to help Phoenix get there, but doing it yourself is so much better.  When I'm trying to work something like that out, I honest to god use the advice Mia gave Phoenix. I take a step back and I turn the case around. ""I have to stop asking why the killer ____, I have to ask why they couldn't ____!"" I did it as a joke one time but while making the joke I actually figured it out, so now I do it for real."

AceAttorney,3dvjvl,BoltGSR,3,Mon Jul 20 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"So: part of the Dai Gyakuten Saiban DLC is beta versions of the songs in the game.   You're probably fine here because for ""Objection!"" they only had beta introductions, not beta versions of the whole song, but they've already released a full beta version of the trial theme, and I imagine they'll do the same for other series mainstays in future DLC.  Note that when I say ""beta"" I mean ""completely different"", at least sometimes - the notes for the beta trial theme talk about how it was designed to feel like AA1's trial theme, but they started from scratch once they saw the final courtroom to better fit the atmosphere.  My point here is that if you want a totally complete version of these, you'll have to wait for all the DLCs to come out and someone to rip the beta songs."

AceAttorney,3dwnze,skilynn,7,Mon Jul 20 04:56:41 2015 UTC,"Everyone else is right: once you meet him without his Godot identity, it's extremely obvious that it's him - same poses, only slightly edited sprites, lots of coffee, and even the same theme. Just knowing his real name doesn't spoil much at all. Just his name alone won't answer anything - if anything, it might give you more unanswered questions after you meet him, because you'll know it's him."

AceAttorney,3dqo0g,iiRockpuppy,2,Sun Jul 19 05:29:31 2015 UTC,"No, that was just a coincidence. It was the second instrumental I found on Youtube, and the only one the guy in question had uploaded. Nothing to do with Ace Attorney at all, but you're right, it does sound similar in parts. All I can take credit for are the lyrics and the singing, though."

AceAttorney,3dpaho,vslds,3,Sat Jul 18 07:14:52 2015 UTC,how is it forced? It's just a little gag on the side I think
AceAttorney,3dpaho,GreenPulsefire,3,Sat Jul 18 09:34:17 2015 UTC,"Forced as in this is SPARDA or who would name a band ""the police""?.  But looking at all those shoutouts, most are not bad."
AceAttorney,3doln7,The_Homestarmy,4,Fri Jul 17 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, The Bitter Taste of Truth is the bestest taste. The reminiscence theme of the grand finale of the AA series, and of the most hilarious and tragic character I have ever seen. It's such a wasted song, it plays like twice, and in such a long case too."
AceAttorney,3doln7,Batmannis,3,Sat Jul 18 00:31:51 2015 UTC,"Tragic Memories is probably my favorite. I love how it has the same melody as Athena's Objection theme, showing that beneath her bright personality, there's a lot of suffering, pain and darkness, but also that she fights against it everyday, and she comes out on top in the end."

AceAttorney,3doln7,JesusMonroe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"Shadow on the Bridge, Bitter Taste of Truth.  Of course DL-6 Incident, that's a classic. It's punchy and a little creepy.  I like KG-8 Incident, too. A little blues-y.  Oh and IS-7 Incident!! Can't forget that one. And I also like The Girl's Lost Memories--it took me a depressingly long time to figure out it was a slowed down version of Kay's usual theme.  Overall, Bitter Taste of Truth is my favorite. I love the transition into the second part."
AceAttorney,3doln7,thecatteam,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:10:51 2015 UTC,"For me, definitely Wandering Heart. Image of Apollo and Clay as children mixed with the theme was perfect for me. One of the few times I've shed tears playing a video game."
AceAttorney,3doln7,vorpoler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:30:00 2015 UTC,"SS-5 Incident.  DL-6 and Bitter Taste of Truth are close seconds, but nothing comes close to SS-5 for me."
AceAttorney,3doln7,guestupvoter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"My favorites are Heartbroken Maya (or True Evening of Grief, as some people call it for some reason) and Departure from Regret. These are the only that made me tear up slightly."

AceAttorney,3doln7,Wayofalex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"DL-6 is one of those songs that just seems iconic in the context of the series. There's a part in the middle of the song, just before it gets hectic, where the melody plays these long, drawn-out notes, as if the song itself were crying. That always gets me, because I just picture Edgeworth sobbing.  Scars Carved by Fire is another one that's really well-made and tailored to fit its case perfectly. The slow progression captures how inevitable the crash was and, much like DL-6, I picture Mimi crying on the road during the last part of the song. Very moving indeed."
