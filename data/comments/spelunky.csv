spelunky,3e2wh9,J63M,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:09:35 2015 UTC,"GENUINE, RUM-FUELD WALL'O'TEXT AHEAD, BRING YER READING GLASSES  The Shield is useful for Hell runs because you get to fight this little guy, the Black Knight for the chance to kill him for his personal, one of a kind item, the Shield, which is a INSANELY useful tool for anyone trying to survive the route to Hell due to its 2 special abilities. If you don't want to read the wiki links, or just want the short form, read the following:   The Shield will block all forms of damage that comes into contact with it (up to and including psychic blasts from Alien Lords/Queens and Anubis), and reflect projectiles like shotgun blasts, mummy fly swarms, and any thrown object back to where it came, which is normally fatal to the poor sucker that fired at you. Explosives will still kill you via blast radius, so you aren't a complete tank, but you can still shrug off damage that would tear apart any other splunker. The Shield will shove EVERYTHING in its path out of the way for you, regardless of whats in the way. Hostile creatures, items, treasure, damsels, shopkeepers, all will get forced along until they hit a solid object. Then they explode into a pile of gibs as though a falling block crushed them. This even works on very large enemies like Mummies, Anubis/Anubis II, Mammoths, and Ol' Bitey. Its so strong, that if you place it under Olmec as he attempts to crush you, the Shield will COMPLETELY STOP HIS DESCENT as though it were a solid entity like a game wall, without crushing or otherwise breaking.   Now, to enter hell, you must find the entry, which is at the lava height of Olmec's Lair. Meaning, you have to make sure Olmec lands in front of the door to Hell when he fatally lands in the lava, as that is your only shot at entering Hell. The Shield can be used to stop him long enough for you to dig a custom path straight to the Hell entrance door, then you simply pick it back up and watch him fall to his death, allowing you an audience with the King of Hell, Yama.  So yeah, that's why people like the Shield."
spelunky,3e2wh9,KingVrox,2,Wed Jul 22 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"The Book of the Dead reveals the location of the door to hell, so that's not really needed. And Olmec wont follow you while you're off screen. Still cool though."

It's not completely unheard of and BRex had streamed an obscene amount of Spelunky around that time. It's completely believable that it happened exactly as shown.  Do we even have any tools that let you force crates to spawn a specific item?   Edit: Looking at his stream from before the score run he wasn't planning on doing a score run.

I have no idea, I'm new to Spelunky and I honestly don't know anything about gaming or any other video games besides Spelunky, or PCs/cheating. Is it still a video game if you play on a PC? Or does it become a computer game then? That's beside the point.    he wasn't planning on doing a score run.   Ah, okay, that makes sense. I haven't seen this video, I just watched levels 1-1 and 1-2, and the second half of the score run, but this video makes it clear it was pretty random."

spelunky,3e0lwh,Promatheus,8,Tue Jul 21 01:11:06 2015 UTC,Not really. Practice is what it takes.   Learn the hit box of the whip; practice on bats. Learn what jumps you can make and what jumps you'll just miss leaving you to plummet to your doom.   Don't try to kill the shopkeeps until you can confidently navigate the mines at the very least.

spelunky,3e0lwh,lithofile,5,Tue Jul 21 07:37:21 2015 UTC,"Hold up/ down to look in the respective directions. Looking down is great to scope out big drops. When on the edge of a ledge hold down and use a rope to drop the rope down rather than shoot it up.   Bombs stick in webs.   Spend all your money at the shops, learn what the items do and how they help.   Go slow and keep an eye out for traps and tricky sections to navigate. Use your bombs and ropes to help get through them/ avoid them completely.   Arrow traps only have one shot, throw/ drop items in front of them to trigger them. You can walk through spikes, took me a while to figure that out."
spelunky,3e0lwh,TrjnRabbit,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:20 2015 UTC,Don't dwell on almost.  You're going to make a lot of mistakes and die a lot of times where you almost could've made it. It happens and you'll learn from those mistakes. It's also very easy to get on tilt because of it.   Each run is a clean start.
spelunky,3e0lwh,alcoer,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting ""zen"" about dying is vital - it's going to happen, and you're going to have to learn to deal with it.  Rather than seeing a late-game death as a failure, try to see it as proof that you can get further."

spelunky,3e0lwh,me_simon,2,Tue Jul 21 07:52:22 2015 UTC,"I'm about to hit 3000 deaths on it.  I think I'm on something like 90 Olmec wins and 50 Yama wins. There will still be days when I can barely make it out of the jungle. My point - Spelunky is not a game you'll quickly master. And even when you complete it, you're far from being a master. Expect to rack up a couple of hundred deaths before you even think you're getting the hang of the mechanics and early enemies.  My tips:   deaths happen. You won't learn until you die. A LOT. Think of each death as a lesson and not a failure. watch some streamers on Twitch. don't anger shopkeepers. Learn to survive normally before you add another enemy to the mix. If it takes 2 bombs and/or ropes to get a damsel or access to a crate, seriously consider whether or not it's worth it. learn the timings for spiders, bats, cobras, frogs and tiki traps. They will be the bane of early days.   You'll either love/hate Spelunky or give up. I hope it's the former because it's an amazing game. Just expect to swear a lot of have the odd rage quit."
spelunky,3e0lwh,rprandi,2,Tue Jul 21 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'd watch streams on twitch.  You can learn some pretty interesting stuff like you can whip arrow traps.   Also,  the whip will hit enemies behind,  above and in front of you. But not in a 45degrees angle in front of you,  so be careful with bats."
spelunky,3e0lwh,Matthias_The_Warrior,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:25 2015 UTC,It might help to watch some people play spelunky on youtube just so you can see what is possible. Other than that you are just going to need to practice and learn how to deal with different enemies.
spelunky,3e0lwh,INSIDIOUS_ROOT_BEER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:43 2015 UTC,The whip is on a delay. Watch out for arrow traps (double damage). Throw pots. Jump on all skeletons. That should probably get you to the Jungle.

spelunky,3e0lwh,KingVrox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:39:56 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about gold. Pretty much ignore it, score shouldn't matter until you're good enough to beat the game consistently. If its right next you, sure, pick it up, but don't try to collect every last bar in the level, its just a waste of time. Just focus on getting to the end of each level alive and getting better at understanding how the enemies and terrain work. That will help you far more than whatever items you might get to buy with the gold you collect."

spelunky,3drjrx,sinosplice,4,Sun Jul 19 08:31:09 2015 UTC,"That's really not a bad idea and would solve this issue for the most part. Only championship flair really should need some sort of verification, I think. Someone gets that on average of once every 2 months or something (and not sure anyone is even currently going for it anymore, except maybe Link and Hectic but I don't think they care a ton about it) so it wouldn't be an issue for anyone who had to verify it.

I really doubt Spelunky 2 is on its way anytime soon - see http://redd.it/2ejb40 - but there are plenty of other games that draw on Spelunky for inspiration.  It's fun to think about different items and interactions for creating your own games, too.  I like the Damsel tracker.  It could be especially useful in Hell for detecting succubi.    The parasite that eats gold is interesting.  Maybe it eats half the gold you collect, then at the end of the level, transforms into an item worth roughly however much gold it ate?    Undead Spelunker who uses items against you could be great, too.  It seems like Hired Hands turn on you plenty already, though!

spelunky,3cylgk,dontforgetpants,2,Sat Jul 11 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"Well on a snakepit level, I'd say grab the mattock, then sacrifice your damsels and buy from the shop quick.  That should leave you with a bunch of time to hit up gems and any crates on the way."
spelunky,3cylgk,eyepants,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, new strategy is to not bother mining for gems until the next level. I'm prioritizing sacrificing the damsel, and then hitting up the shop, only mining gems along the way if convenient or there's something in the shop I can't afford."
spelunky,3cylgk,alcoer,2,Mon Jul 13 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"emphasis on getting the mattock if it's possible   This. Mattock is the priority if you're just aiming to complete the regular game/Hell. It's probably worth it if you're going for speedlunky, too."
spelunky,3cylgk,Psyvane,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Why is the mattock priority for completing the game? Doesn't it normally break pretty quickly anyway?

spelunky,3cylgk,alcoer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:08:35 2015 UTC,"nah the mattock is good for at least 20-30 hits, meaning you can get tens of thousands of gold if you mine for gems. This way its easier to get enough money to buy all you need from the black market, without pissing off 7 shopkeepers."
spelunky,3cylgk,KingVrox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:10:47 2015 UTC,I think I just need to use my mattock more sparingly/carefully it sounds like.
spelunky,3cylgk,Brandon23z,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:06:12 2015 UTC,"If you're just trying to complete the game then don't go for gems, use the mattock to go around obstacles and dangerous enemies instead.  That said, it won't help much in the ice caves. Hopefully you'll have some other kind of mobility by then, or enough spare ropes to take things carefully."
spelunky,3cylgk,KingVrox,3,Mon Jul 13 08:43:20 2015 UTC,"It's often possible to get out of them without much hassle, usually just a single rope, sometimes not even that, you can just jump from ledge to ledge. If you can see anything in it worth a rope, go for it, if not, don't bother."
spelunky,3cylgk,Brandon23z,3,Mon Jul 13 11:27:58 2015 UTC,"There's a mattock in every pit. Don't even waste a rope, use a bomb to get the mattock then you can easily mine a few blocks out at the bottom."
spelunky,3cylgk,KingVrox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:28:09 2015 UTC,Depends on whether you value ropes or bombs more.
spelunky,3cylgk,blairmichod,2,Sun Jul 12 17:35:06 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. But why waste a rope to get out when the mattock will do just that and you'll also be able to mine gems and get enough money to buy a fresh pile of ropes. All at the cost of a single bomb. The mattock pays for itself.
spelunky,3cylgk,Brandon23z,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:50 2015 UTC,"Cause I just rob the shopkeepers, so I have no need for gems unless I'm going for a score run, which I don't do often."

spelunky,3cwqdb,Dathaen,3,Sat Jul 11 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"My advice? Take it slow. Don't run all the time, but don't take long enough for the ghost to show up. Be stingy with bombs and ropes - don't use them unless you know you're getting the value back and then some to buy more (or unless there's a crate). Think before you do, but be ready to act quick if things don't go as planned."
spelunky,3cwqdb,Dathaen,3,Sat Jul 11 20:23:14 2015 UTC,I have a heavy pinky. I pretty much always hold down shift. I've been learning to walk in uncharted territory. One of my weaknesses is always running. I always run into arrow traps off screen and they appear on screen for a second then hit me.
spelunky,3cwqdb,Dathaen,3,Sun Jul 12 21:16:24 2015 UTC,"Learn how to whip the arrows out of the air. It'll take some getting used to the timing, but it is probably the best thing to learn early on."
spelunky,3cwqdb,Brandon23z,2,Sun Jul 12 21:29:32 2015 UTC,I did not know you could do this!
spelunky,3cwqdb,eyepants,2,Mon Jul 13 09:30:29 2015 UTC,"Yep! Here are some tips on how it's done. If the arrow trap is two blocks away as you pass in front of it (think falling into a hole with the arrow trap being one of the ledges) whip as soon as you start to fall. If the block is further than two blocks away, the timing varies but generally since they move so fast you'll want to whip as soon as the arrow has left the trap."
spelunky,3cwqdb,Dathaen,2,Mon Jul 13 12:31:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!
spelunky,3cwqdb,yegon,2,Mon Jul 13 17:18:52 2015 UTC,No problem. Happy spelunking!
spelunky,3cwqdb,MWGND,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:34:10 2015 UTC,Hah I've done it a few times. It's a great trick to learn. New players might not have a rock and call the game unfair when they're trapped. A pro would be able to get out of that situation.
spelunky,3cwqdb,eyepants,2,Sun Jul 12 22:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm already working towards these things, I think. Thanks for the advice :)  I did used to just charge around the place and moan that I never got past 1-2, but that was quite a while ago."

spelunky,3ctqwr,Kinnijup,3,Fri Jul 10 18:29:57 2015 UTC,Cool comic. Have you done the key run yet? I haven't beaten Olmec in one run but it is important to familiarize yourself with temple and Olmec so you need to unlock the third shortcut!

spelunky,3ceqad,alcoer,2,Tue Jul 7 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"I keep meaning to mess with this myself, having watching you do it a few times, it seems quite consistent. (Krille does this at 4:30, btw.)  Great job on the video, krille, lots to think about. Looking forwards to the Yama strats tutorial!"
spelunky,3ceqad,Pibonacci,2,Tue Jul 7 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"Oh he did, nice. Admittedly, I only skipped through most strategies, instead of watching the whole video myself, and didn't see it mentioned there. And yes, it seems consistent, ever since I realized the key actually is to just throw the bombs quickly after each other. which seems not intuitive at all, you might think you want to space them out more, but no. I've done it on multiple important runs where it was preferable to the normal way (like my low% no gold run), and it never failed me, so yeah."

spelunky,3ceox9,WedTS,4,Tue Jul 7 09:27:37 2015 UTC,"I don't agree and this may come down to personal preference but in my opinion, the Web Gun's design makes sense. it looks far less futuristic than the Freeze Ray which is sensible given their functionality. the Web Gun also has a white ball-like thing at its peak which matches its ability to throw white balls of Web. Freeze Ray has a much more complex look (judging from the peak) and looks more futuristic, as mentioned. also, I don't want to see white Webs getting shot from a yellow ''gun'' and I don't want blue Ice Rays getting shot by a blue ''gun'', contrast is always good. just my opinon though."
spelunky,3ceox9,Volcanolotus04,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:37:52 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't see what's so good about contrast. The Web Gun looks like a typical freeze ray - it is blue and it got an aerial (which could produce an ice shot). The Freeze Ray just dosn't fit its usage - instead, it got a wide barrel for web balls and a colour matching the web. Spelunky is a hard game, so it would be nice to at least have weapons that can be intuitively guessed. And I would never guess the usage of freeze ray just by looking at it."
spelunky,3ceox9,Volcanolotus04,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"well I saw the usage of it immediately because of its looks. as I said, it's a matter of opinion and I respect yours."
