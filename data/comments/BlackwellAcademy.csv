We will be using these meetings as an opportunity to discuss any evidence found to try to identify the person behind these crimes.  I've been targeted, so I'm in this whether I like it or not. I just don't want to see anyone put themselves in danger if they don't have to.  I don't mean to come across as menacing or anything, but the person who is behind this is likely on the forums as well, and it's in our best interest to keep things as secretive as possible. Again, we'd love it if you could lend a hand, just know what you're getting into.  -Ethan"

BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,AidenCervantes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:53:40 2015 UTC,"Emily was always a little giggly about sex-ed, but she couldn't deny that she was interested in how they'd handle the subject with people who were basically adults. She hadn't signed up for the class formally, but figured she could give it a shot, and, that at worst, it'd give her some browny points with a new teacher.  She sat down, listening to the teacher. Cervantes? She eyed the man. Alex had talked about her brother before, but never described him. Plus, she had said he was very gentle and understanding. Mr. Cervantes seemed rather dry and a little... formal. He didn't have that spark that Alex had whatsoever, yet she figured that, since he was the only one Alex liked being with, would be similar. Emily kind of pushed away her train of thought, as it was her turn to speak.  ""I'm Emily. I'm theoretically from Spain, but I've lived here mostly. Moved around a lot though. Uh, I guess I'm from Seattle, as that was where I lived last."" She thought about the last part for a bit. ""I just wanted to check it out and see if it was telling me stuff I don't know yet. Uh..."" She noticed she sounded a little high-and-mighty, as if she belittled the course. ""I mean, I just wanna see if it's for me, really."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,EmilyDelOak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Aiden's eyes immediately fixated on the tiny girl. This was the girl that Alex was dating. He knew this instantly. From the description and the conversation they had the other day, it was clear that this was indeed the girl. Her revealing her name, and information proved it.  Compared to his normal tone, his tone lightened almost as if he was talking to Alex herself. ""Thank you, Emily."" he said in an odd and light tone, not usual for his demeanor. No favorites. he told himself. Half of him wanted to observe the girl the whole time, to see what made her so special. The other half wanted to straight up question the girl. Was she planning anything? Would she eventually break his sisters heart? His mind almost become a war zone, but he snapped back to reality and back into the classroom. They were in a professional setting.  When were you one for professionalism? the voiced ringed in his head. He scowled, still looking at Emily carefully.   ""Please take a look at your syllabus."" his tone now recovering into its normal loudness and demand. ""Do you have any questions for me? Or about the syllabus. Please let me know."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,EmilyDelOak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"""Actually, yeah, I kinda do."" Maybe it was the weird week she was having, but Emily felt particularly blunt today. ""Don't get this wrong, Mister..."" She paused for a second, eyeing him noticably. ""Cervantes, but... I don't know, it's just weird to think people at our age need sex-ed. For me at least. This isn't going to be one of those preachy, pro-abstinence kinda courses, is it? I'm just wondering... I imagine most of us have an idea of... all this."" She blushed a little as she spoke, both from the subject and her being so straight-forward. ""I apologize if I seem disrespectful, I don't mean to..."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,EmilyDelOak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:00:31 2015 UTC,"""How much do you know about sex, young lady?"" he bluntly stated back.   ""No. These are the kind of questions we need, I appreciate your input."" he tone was still harsh, even though he seemed a little genuine in his words. It was hard to tell. ""Kids at your age have sex all the time. I'm not here to stop that. Just educate on safer and more protective sex."" he paused a took a breath.  He eyed her cautiously, knowing that she's still just a kid - Alex's age. That she did not mean to seem authoritative. To him, she had no power here.  ""Cut the apologies, Emily. I don't accept them here. I only accept the full attention of my students on there studies."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,EmilyDelOak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:10:25 2015 UTC,"Emily felt a little taken back. This guy was somewhat intimidating in his own way. Almost like a drill sergeant, she thought. ""Oh I'm paying attention alright."" She didn't believe her own tone, but somehow, Mister Cervantes made her feel particularly stubborn and challenging.  ""To answer your question, sir..."" She said, with an emphasis on the 'sir'. ""I'd like to think I know enough about sex to be saf..."" For a second, the connection between a lack of safety and sex sent her flashbacks of surpressed memories. She winced almost unnoticably for a quick moment, then looked back into his eyes again. ""uhm... to be safe, I mean."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,EmilyDelOak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"He scowled at Emily's tone. Although, that didn't seem to change his facial structure much as his face was basically in a perpetual frown.  He stood up straight and took a step towards Emily. ""Is there something on your mind, Emily?"" his tone was loud and questionable. He noticed the changed in response. Knowing that it had elicited some sort of odd response from her.  ""So, I take it from your hesitation and your understanding about sex, that you know almost next to nothing. You've currently told me nothing about what you know, just what you think you know. That's not good enough."" his eyes pierced her like a hawk. He scanned her, sizing her up like they prey she was."
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,belladelarosa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:25:35 2015 UTC,"Emily had hoped that her little blackout would go by unnoticed, but she soon felt confirmed in assuming that Aiden wasn't exactly the type of guy to graciously let it slide.   ""No... I just had a... I just remembered something."" She shook her head a little, then looked up at him, trying to give him her bravest and most confident face. ""Well, Mister Cervantes, maybe you should consider that knowledge isn't connected to how comfortably you are speaking about something."" Unbeknownst to Emily, this was surprisingly accurately describing Aiden's own approach with his time in the army.   The girl took a deep breath, trying to remain as mature and confident as she could. ""I mean, what exactly am I to prove? What's so complicated about sex? Birth control? Not THAT big of a deal to understand, right? Protection, like condoms? I don't even need them and know how they're properly put on. That you roll them down, that you pinch the tip. That kind of stuff."" Her face got a little red as she spoke, but now her confidence left her. She didn't feel ready at all to talk about any of the more core themes of sex in front of an entire classroom. Blushing, she just stopped talking, hoping she had proven her point."
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,belladelarosa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:09 2015 UTC,"Aiden's brows furrowed. It was true, but he wasn't going to let her know that.   ""There is more to it than just that, Emily. Have you ever heard of female condoms that are specifically for females. Or what about an oral dam, for oral sex? Did you know that there are polyurethane gloves specifically made for manual penetration?"" he stopped in his tracks, knowing fully well he could go on. He did not mean to dismiss the girl on what she knew, he just knew that there was so much she was missing.  ""Have you even checked yourself? To make sure your not caring any diseases?"" he eyed her suspiciously, he also knew that Emily and Alex had probably hooked up more than once, so she was probably safe in that department, he just had to say so anyways. ""It's not really any of my business, but you may want to discuss that with...your partner. If you have one."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,belladelarosa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Emily's face now carried a bright red shade. She actually sank a little lower in her chair, her body language was defensive. She tried to muster up a proper response, but just shook her head very slightly. ""I..."" She didn't even know what to say. ""Okay... okay, I just... I'll just listen and... yeah..."" Well, this is certainly not an abstince preaching course... Her head felt incredibly hot, and she didn't dare to look if anyone was staring at her. She felt like a million eyes preyed on her embarassment. ""I'm... healthy though..."""
BlackwellAcademy,3d9kvv,belladelarosa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:26 2015 UTC,"He now noticed the girl seemed to diminish in size, in fact it was almost as if she was trying to make herself disappear within the classroom. He sighed, as it was now noticeable that Emily looked red beyond comparison.  ""Emily, may I speak to you outside of the classroom?"" he asked. He wanted to save his own ass, knowing well that Alex would chew him out had he not have tried to 'play nice' with her significant other. He was just trying to look out for Alex, as best as he could."

About an hour later, he had a pretty generic presentation on the Ramones, their music, and their impact on society and the genre as a whole.   Maybe I'll be able to get by with this.

BlackwellAcademy,3d5u9l,James-Edwards,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:49:00 2015 UTC,"I was one of the founding 3.  Me, Kohowch, and the-bassonist.  We started small and kept a nice sub going, then OTT hype and the OTT era began.  We fucked up pretty big, and shit hit the fan faster than Bruce Lee's 1"" punch.  Skip to the days where rules and mod power ruled, I liked being simple and soft on the users, everyone loved me as a mod, but my character is still stuck in the OTT days, so I'm generally off of the RP.  Mods are getting mmore and more power hungry, and they are just looking for tthe weakest prey, and thdy found us, the art mods.  Constantly shushed, when the big ones wanna talk they kill our modmail rights, they don't even have the balls to tell us in our faces that we're getting Changed someday or even giving us the right to give a vote on adding or removing rules.  Just another slave for their bitch asses.  Then I had a life crisis that got me so pissed off I almost broke up with my fiancée after two years of happy talking and happy life.  So I decided to focus on feeding the mouths in our shared apartment and get the payments for both the car that was damaged in an accident and rent.  In the midst of me writing I got sick and tired of the mods, so I said few hurtful things, and honestly I regret doing so, not because of what happened, but it greatly affected Sami's popularity in the sub.  Fast forward to few problems between 2 users that Sami can't do anything about, she sends one of them to me and talk to him and give him pointers on how to deal with that shit.  Sent the mods a heads-up about the shitstorm coming their way, made a thread with my approved account and posted an image along with an apology letter.  One of the mods decides to diss me and ban me without even letting me talk back and defend myself.  I hijack one of the mod's account and delete the entire CSS, image, and flair data.  Basically a ""go fuck yourself"", it was my art after all and I would never let them use it again after the humiliation they caused me.  and since then, I've hated the incompetent mods, and they hated me along with the rest of the sub.  Fast forward to Sami getting kicked off, she locks herself in her room and cries.  I diss the ever living shit outta the mods and their brash behavior.  Explaining my situation and what happened exactly to everyone, the community listened to be and upvoted my comments.  I proved that the mods ain't got shit.  They banned me, in that moment I sent all of the users that were there what happened and they all left momentarily, leaving the sub empty, so they gave me back my voice and I destroyed their ""powers"" and called them out on all the wrong shit they done.  Sami kept RPing even after the bullshit and I said fuck it all.  Kept roaming Other subs but can't seem to get any form of pleasure from them.  Then I foumd Blackwell and Sami joined, sending me a message about it and telling me that the mod is a friend of hers, so I'm cool.  And here I am.  A Blackwell teacher.  An artist that finally found a community that will accept his kind without tyranny."

Lou: since in regular days we all live in a single house and share workloads, ideas don't come easily as your mind keeps running about a lot of shit.  Between fixing my backup car, getting rent, pulling papers out my ass to give the financial aid another reason not to fuck me over, and taking care of my blind fiancee.  both of us are fucking wrecked.  Now that we're having a holiday with the family, that's why we're finally free to actually try and get ideas.

Lou: I think that the greatest part about RPing with someone is the actual talk itself.  the wittier and more informate and entertaining it is, the better it is on my scale.  Not that Fleshed out is bad, but monotone becomes a bit too boring after a while, like Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He is too fucking old to do another TermiTaters: Sinyle Skynet."

With the left side of her body pretty much casted up; she had no desire to do much. She grabbed her phone, and played with it a bit before the idea of texting Emily had popped up into her head.  Emily had acted odd yesterday. Which the thought of it now had filled her head with worry. She sat up in bed, now going through her phone to the contacts. She clicked on Emily's name and typed.  To Emily: ""Hey babe. How are you doing? I was hoping that maybe we could chill a bit?"" she bit her lip and then sent the text. For some reason she felt more anxious then usual."

Emily's face tensed up a little, as she gave herself a little, breathed in heavily and... yes, she grabbeb the bag. Unwrapping the goods, she took one of the boomers out and eyed it for a moment. Finally, her arm moved and she ate the whole thing.   Her face scrunched up. ""Brrr..."" She felt like she was chewing on dirt. Quickly, she grabbed her water bottle, trying to wash it down. After a few clicks of her tongue, she texted back.  ""Sounds perfect. Ill be over in a second, okay? Hope ur feeling a little better :)"" She quickly made her way towards Alex's dorm, hoping she'd be a better girlfriend today than she was yesterday."

Sitting on the edge of her bed, casually waiting for Emily to appear as she always had, a quick knock, an entrance and a very cheery 'hello'.  Which Emily came and did just that. She looked at Emily who had just made her way into her dorm, and smiled warmly. It was always a pleasure on her eyes to see her favorite person.   ""I would come and greet you..."" she looked at her casted ankle and wiggled it. ""These things kinda prevent that."" she grinned at her and out reached her hand and grasped at air - wanting Emily to come closer.

""Well, yesterday..."" she began, only have her voice trail off and then once again pick back up as she tried to find the right words. ""You seemed distant. I don't know. Maybe I'm just being stupid and insecure, but you were definitely a bit quieter than you usually are."" her tone was light, but a little bit suspicious.

I just felt..."" She looked down and tilted her head so Alex couldn't look at her. ""I just felt... like I was the third wheel. Like I didn't belong..."" She scoffed at herself.

BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,rileydonnelly,3,Sat Jul 11 20:44:27 2015 UTC,"Texting, Nathan was heading towards to where the school bus was. He needed to get out of Blackwell Academy every now and then. Where was he going, you ask? That was none of your business.  Unfortunately, he didn't see the new girl who was in his way and preoccupied with the map, so he bumped into her bony shoulder.   ""Watch it, girl --"" he started to say but stopped because when he looked up to glower at her, her appearance simply astounded him. She looked like a homeless person despite her clothes; she wasn't dirty, but she looked as if she lived in a trash can all her life. Not to mention, she reeked of cheap cigarettes and what was with her face? Whatevathefuck?  ""What are you doing here?"" He frowned deeply, taking a step back (because oh god, she stank -- Nathan was rich, so he never tried cheap cigarettes before nor does he want to), obviously unaware of the fact that she was a new student here starting from today. To him, she just looked like a random stranger with a suitcase and a map, and looking like shit."
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Nathan_Prescott,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"It was a simple shoulder bump but being as skinny as she was, the force sent Riley stumbling to the ground. A simple grunt had passed her lips and besides that nothing. She hadn't been looking in front of her and it wasn't anything to get riled up about.   As she brushed herself off Riley took the chance to look at the other student. With his slicked back hair and preppy clothes he looked as if he owned the place. Completely the opposite from herself - the two couldn't be more further apart. And yet here they were, both seniors in Blackwell Academy.   ""I dunno."" She spoke in monotone. She sniffed before rummaging through her pockets for a smoke. It'd become a habit for her to smoke in the face of stress and already she could feel her fingers and lips twitching. Or maybe it was her imagination, she didn't know and at this point didn't care."
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Nathan_Prescott,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"She really reminded Nathan of that homeless woman he saw a few times near Two Whales. Stupid, weak, and gross as fuck. He really didn't want anything to do with this one. Could this chick be related to her?  Her answer to his question was vague too and it didn't make any sense, but whatthefuckever.  ""What the fuck?"" He raised an eyebrow at her. ""Go back to your trash where you fucking belong then."" Honestly, where was that nosy Pornstache at a time like this? Everyone should just bow down and thank Nathan for catching the creeper in the campus."
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Jordan_Rhodes,2,Sun Jul 19 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"""This painting sucks..""  Jordan grumbled, letting her canvas dry against a tree. Her eyes shifted carefully towards a new student passing by. ""You look lost."""
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Jordan_Rhodes,2,Sat Jul 11 21:52:14 2015 UTC,"""Uh yeah. I think I am."" Her eyes strayed towards the canvas. Finally, something she liked. Not that she was going to whip out a brush but it did shine a positive light on the redhead. ""I'm just looking for the dorms. Know it?"" While waiting for an answer Riley tacked on a quick compliment. ""Nice painting."""
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Jordan_Rhodes,2,Sat Jul 11 23:27:04 2015 UTC,"Jordan's face lit up red. The only person who didn't like her paintings was herself. ""Thanks...uh...I can show you where they are..."""

BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,belladelarosa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"""No, not that I know of. There's a cheerleading club, swim team, music club, and a monster-hunting club, from what I've heard."" Jordan explained, tossing stray pieces of dyed hair to the side. ""I'm on the swim team, but we haven't done much. I might organize something soon."""
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,belladelarosa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:12:26 2015 UTC,"Cheerleading, swim, music - those clubs were definitely off limits to her. They all required some sort of skill which Riley didn't possess. Not that she planned to do much outside of lounge in her bed all day long. ""Monster-hunting?"" Riley mulled over joining it in her head. She could already guess at the things going on in that club. Maybe she could score some free booze out of there. After all, one would need to be drunk or delusional to actually believe the whole monster under one's bed shtick. ""I might join that. What do you think about it?"""
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,belladelarosa,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:54:35 2015 UTC,"Jordan shrugged, then stretched her arms into the air. ""Go crazy. Not literally, though. We have plenty of nuts here."" That reminded her of something. ""Speaking of nuts, there's  the Vortex Club."""
BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,belladelarosa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:26:31 2015 UTC,"""Vortex Club? No idea what that is."" From the name of it it sounded something like a carnival ride.

BlackwellAcademy,3cy3rj,Salp97,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:55:08 2015 UTC,"""Sure."" Riley paused, pulling her suitcase up to heel. ""Where's the dorm?"" She handed over the wrinkled piece of paper and scratched her head. It'd been a long ride to Blackwell and she was quite aware of the smokey smell lingering around her."

Illusions.""

Our eyes see one thing, but our brain knows another and immediately discards the image as nothing more than a funny twist of our senses.""  He allows a few moments for his students to reflect before going on as frankly that was a little heavy.

Walking in triumphantly and slapping his bookbag into an unoccupied booth he went into the washroom to relieve himself.  Inside he saw some of the graffiti this small town seemed to have an abundance of. Carvings of cryptic riddles, rude and lewd sexual remarks, plain and ugly swear words. Jack laughed at them all as he finished his business and got back in his booth.  It wasn't long before Joyce swung by and not so much longer that a Reuben fell before him and he fell upon it. Chris was no liar, this put the D in licious as he chowed down with reckless abandon to the point that some customers stopped to stare.  Leaning back in the booth he spun his fork looking over what remained of his meal then lazily looked outside to see the early morning mist evaporating. After taking in the nature he saw Joyce approaching and her eyes asked what he thought,  ""This...I don't have the polite words to describe this deliciousness."" Jack answered as he patted his belly.

Snickering to himself at his little game ended he came across a so far empty slate, but a not so empty room.   Inside was a young man kicking it in a pretty cool chair. At first Jack thought he was asleep, but closer examination revealed that he was just chillin. Leaning in ever so slightly through the open portal Jack said, ""New guy?"""
BlackwellAcademy,3c8syq,Jordan_Rhodes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"Hearing voices from outside the hallway of the dormitory, Vincent opened his eyes in a surprised manner, searching for the source as his sight darted to the open door in which a boy that was around his age stood, brown hair seen upon his head with eyes to match. However, it seemed impossible that the girly voice he had heard would belong to this guy. And true enough a voice seeming more fit for the guy that stood in the doorway was heard a moment after the thought had passed Vincent’s mind. “New guy?” the boy inquired.  .  “Erm. Quite so!” It took a second Vincent to match his smile with his enthusiastic voice as he stood from the cozy leather chair, out of habit adjusting his old teams red-armed and blue baseball jacket as he walked towards Jack with a friendly and charming grin, his hand extended to shake that of Jacks. “Starting here tomorrow. Name’s Vincent Capello.” He said, deciding to lean the doorway opposite of Jack once they had shaken hands, his eyes scanning the hallway with mild curiosity for the other voice he believed to have heard, making him spot a girl who was heading for the exit and another boy who stood a bit further away with a camera. As the girl approached, he would nod in her direction with a smile."

The room was nicely put together, very minimalist, or he hadn't finished unpacking. Looking over it he hardly noticed the approaching camera wielding fellow until he spoke up.

She was too weak for anything else. She hadn't anticipated being texted by her girlfriend - in fact - it was something she'd rather avoid with her overall.  She looked at her phone as it lit up on the small desk that resided next to the bed. With her one good arm she reached over and groaned as she grabbed it and held it above.   A message. From Emily. Fuckfuckfuck  Alex dropped the phone on her face, causing her to cry out in pain. She quickly scrambled to get it off and to type back.  ""I would say yes but I'm not feeling too well and all."" she hit sent.   Well, what I'm saying is true...I just don't want her to see me like this. she put down her phone and sighed.

Anything serious?"" She wondered what would make Alex decline her. Emily felt uneasy, like when a storm was coming up. She couldn't explain why the answer mader her so uncomfortable, but something just felt off. She grabbed her phone tighter and deleted her message. Starting at the screen for a minute, she figured she had to be blunt here. Rewriting what she had asked, she added to her message:  To Alex: ""Ur having a cold or something? Anything serious? Im always worried about u :3 are u in ur dorm?"""

To Emily: ""I don't know if it's serious."" I'm fucking lying. Fuck me. she thought to herself as she wrote it - her head started to pound and ache. Okay, maybe I do need you in here..

I'll check in with you later :)""   She hit send and put her phone on her desk right after. She knew Alex wouldn't just ask her to come in like that, so she figured she may as well surprise her. Grabbing her softest blanket, a pillow and some orange juice she had brought with her earlier, she threw the first two over her shoulder and locked the door behind her. Quickly approaching Alex's dorm, she breathed in one time, then flung the door wide open.  ""Hellooooooooooo!"" she said, loudly, smiling at Alex. ""I'll be your nurse today."" She closed the door behind her. ""I mean, you didn't think I'd ACTUALLY let you be like this, did you? Oh and uh... you should lock the door with a psycho on the loose.

Jack liked this thing and apparently he was decent at it which is weird because he really wasn't doing anything that different.   Looking out at the main building he nodded in appreciation as he took in the new angle. It was a fairly big building, bigger than his old school that was for sure. He could fill that place with a lot of hopes and desires, but he stopped short. There was still that matter of murder and kidnapping, and also a curfew. Jack shook it off and shrugged, just gotta roll with it.   Hands in his pockets he looked to see a campus you usually only see in brochures. Everyone was smiling, laughing, chilling under trees, and there was even the classic guitar guy and whaddya know he was playing 'Wonderwall' bless him.   Once inside the hallowed halls of learning and for many the semi-hallowed halls of leaning as they pressed their weight against various lockers and shot the shit Jack checked himself to make sure he forgot nothing.   Notebook. Check Pencil of the number two variety. Check Three pens. Check Wallet, phone, room key, oxygen. Check, check, check, and checkerino  Nodding as his mental list was compiled he took time to look over all the advertisements and clubs. A lot about swimming, the new curfew, and some people did seem preoccupied with global warming. Turning to Chris he commented,  ""Seems like this place is going a million directions at once.""  Walking through the halls and dodging the late and the just plain rude he spotted his locker and moved toward it.

Moving swiftly he counted room by room until at last 317....319....322! Moving inside he saw a group of already seated and vaguely ready to learn students. Taking a seat in the middle so as to show he was both not a delinquent and not a teacher's pet he sat back laying a blank slate before him and much like his pristine notebook he set out to make a bunch of impressions that vaguely would make sense if you got to know him."

Anyway. Based on what those guys said it was going to be the 7th but they have to wait for approval on all platforms. So they are now saying the 14th.

It was a decent nap -- at least, he felt more rested now.  Feeling much better, he decided to leave the male dorms and was closing the door behind him when someone timidly called out, attempting to catch his attention. He looked up and saw a girl looking pretty nervous. Which, by the way, didn't make him feel like he should be nicer to her or anything, especially since she just asked if he sold some shit.  ""Stuff?"" He crossed his arms, raising an eyebrow, ""First of all, who the hell are you?"" He assumed by 'stuff,' she meant the good shit he had, but he couldn't just tell her, ""Oh yeah, you want some green?

Is she that goddamn stupid? This girl almost got him worked up again before he noticed that she herself thought that that was an idiotic thing to say. That made Nathan snicker though he wasn't sure if she heard him or not (not that he cares, to be honest). Anyway, Nathan didn't want to get angry again (when he just pretty much calmed himself down before he went outside), so he started to scratch at his arm, to distract himself from getting irritated, and focused on what she had to say.  As soon as she was done talking, he stopped what he was doing also and simply replied, ""Yeah, alright, I get it. C'mon."" Nathan then gestured her to follow him inside.

So, this is all in his perspective. ))  Nathan Prescott's summary:   Came back to Blackwell Academy after being fucking suspended for a while  Met a bunch of peasants Nathan's impression on them: Orion seemed...ok, Nathan thought Bella was being stupid and nosy, he disrespected the librarian (Hanako Ikezawaii) because he concluded that she's damn annoying like all the other teachers, Quinn pissed the fuck out of Nathan, so she's now in his most-hated-and-I-will-kill-them-if-it's-the-last-fucking-thing-I-do-list, Nathan's first impression on Tristan was that Tristan is a pussy, and Junior just wanted some good shit Wanted to choke the death out of Quinn but Tristan just had to get in the way, so Nathan punched him instead. Now Quinn and Tristan have the fucking evidence. Will probably have to go threaten the principal,  just in case. If he sees them again, he's going to make them wish they've never been born. Got to meet Victoria after what felt like a long time ((OOC: though I think that they would have still be in contact through emails or something even while he was suspended and she was in Spain)) -- he will go get wasted with her.

BlackwellAcademy,3bfwxw,NoahDnls,2,Mon Jun 29 19:36:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It's really really hard RPing official characters...it's hard to get their personalities down in situations they have never been in before. Plus, with Max dating a guy, a lot of people don't see her as like...I don't know, they see her kind of like a-sexual which she doesn't seem to be.  So people can really ram you for representing a character wrong. Not to mention in my case, we don't really know Kate too well..and have HARDLY seen her happy. So I hope I am making it realistic.  But you have it down perfectly I think."
BlackwellAcademy,3bfwxw,TinaPedrosa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"Just being honest~  Yeah, I know what you mean. It's especially because Episode 4 and 5 aren't out yet, so, yes, like you said, we still don't know everything about the characters.  And yeah, I don't think she's asexual too. I can see why some people might think that way, but Max's sexuality isn't even confirmed officially, so no one knows what her sexuality is, except for Dontnod. I think it's fine if you want Max to date a guy though.   That's true and I hope that if any of us do make a mistake of rping the character ooc (and that's okay! We're all humans, we make mistakes), they would pm us politely and be nice about it.  And that's so true (we see her getting bullied in the very first scene after all), but I think you do make Kate realistic. She seems to be a gentle and shy kind of person, and you roleplay her like that. Don't worry too much and have fun roleplaying! I can see that you're doing your best and I don't think you're rping them wrong. You're doing awesome! 👍  And oh gosh, thank you! >//< But, ahaha, I'm just trying to stay in character as much as I can really. ;; I don't know everything about Nathan yet either (for instance, what was with that look on his face at the end of Episode 2?

He respected it and wanted to honor it. It has her style all over it and is inspired by her song, Book of Days. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQjt9VGxIdM)   James Horner...

No, not really... except with, you know... feeling lame as fuck...  She gave her answer several tries. She didn't want to seem desperate, needy, worried, clingy, overly attached. But what was the alternative? Being distant? Cold? Too casual? She thought about what Bella had said to her. 'some people say being clingy is bad, but fuck them, it's your relationship'. Right. That was true. Fuck it.  Her fingers slided over the screen.  To Alex: ""Not really. Busy missing you, maybe.""  She stared at the message for a solid minute. Yeah, good job, make her feel weird. She decided to add to that.  To Alex: ""Not really. Busy missing you, maybe. :P What's up? Sexting? Homework help? Both?!""  She hit send as she leaned back in her bed, staring at the screen.

Alex was slapped in the face with a smile upon seeing who it was from. Emily. Somehow her heart slowed, she felt a wave of relief follow up her slap of a smile.  Her eyes rushed the screen, and she quickly fiddled to unlock her phone to reply to Emily. She read the text, and her confidence grew. There's nothing to be worried about, is there? She closed her eyes momentarily, hoping that the previous images would leave her mind. But they did not. Her eyes shot open once, more and clicked on the phone that was soon fading into it's normal sleep mode.  ""I wan-"" she type in, only to erase it moments later.   To Emily: ""I need to talk to you. I miss you, and I need to see you.""   She hovered over the send button, and hit it, sighing in the process. She knew that her own words sounded, off. She wasn't the type to go needing this or that. She was capable. Independent. Not some scared two-year old child who needed their blanket. But this wasn't about her, this was about Emily and keeping her safe.
