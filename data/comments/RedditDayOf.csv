It's pretty unsettling to think about how these people died without due process or a lawyer, really just because they were suspected to know something valuable."
RedditDayOf,3dw1x8,epsenohyeah,4,Mon Jul 20 14:05:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'll second that about the comments. A lot of them were so quick to justify these tortures as ""all's fair in love and war"". Also just a lot of liberal hate without any rationality behind it."

RedditDayOf,3dud2q,temporarycreature,14,Sun Jul 19 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"The prisoner was restrained while the executioner tightened a metal band around his neck until he died. Some versions of the garrote incorporated a metal bolt which pressed in to the spinal chord, breaking the neck. This spiked version is known as the Catalan garrote."

RedditDayOf,3dud2q,Sisaac,3,Sun Jul 19 20:17:36 2015 UTC,Does it signify that it is a black man? I assume Catalan refers to Spain? God that looks awful.
RedditDayOf,3dud2q,rhubourbon,3,Mon Jul 20 04:04:13 2015 UTC,"Catalunya is part of what today is Spain, but they have a separate identity and language than the rest of the country, up to the fact catalonians find being called Spanish offensive. Anyway, I digress.   From what I remember from watching a recreation of this thing in an Inquisition museum in Cartagena, the torture originated in Europe, but was extensively used in the Spanish colonies. This looks like Filipino men doing the execution, so that would explain why the odd choice."
RedditDayOf,3du4gi,dkjb,5,Sun Jul 19 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"It means that no matter what, something's gonna come fuck your day up. No matter how fucking carefully you plan it out before you get hit by a bullet, you're still getting hit by a bullet.   So, the Buddah is telling you to accept the suffering. Embrace it as part of your life. If you experience suffering, know that it's still okay, and just enjoy the parts of life you aren't suffering."
RedditDayOf,3du4gi,TrueBlue224,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:43:22 2015 UTC,"That's the first of the four noble truths. Suffering is an inevitable part of our lives now, in our current mental state. However, the other three truths tell us that it doesn't have to be. If you reach a state permanently free of suffering (truth 3), there is no suffering to embrace, to fear etc."
RedditDayOf,3du4gi,gorba,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:59 2015 UTC,"I was depressed a few years ago, and I constantly felt like the world was against me.  Every day I felt overwhelmed by grades, social drama, and guilt.    Then I got better.  I went to therapy, I came to terms with what was keeping me down, and I made amends with my friends.  Then I got a bad grade on a paper and it felt exactly as crushing as it would have a few months earlier.  I felt terrible, like the world was against me, like there was nothing I could do.  My friends continued to disappoint me and it continued to hurt.  I still couldn't quit smoking.   That was when I understood the first noble truth.  Thinking back, I can divide my life into periods of depression and enthusiasm, but things are constantly happening that make me feel like shit.  It's just that sometimes I deal with it, and sometimes I mope and complain.    If you wait to be happy until things get better, you will be sad forever.  Accept that you will always be able to find an excuse to feel bad, and stop desiring that life be fair to you.  Adversity is the constant immutable state of the universe, and accepting this does wonders for your mental health."

RedditDayOf,3dtp9v,baskandpurr,2,Sun Jul 19 13:17:58 2015 UTC,Thanks I thought the same and hope the irony is not lost
RedditDayOf,3dtp9v,baskandpurr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:31:40 2015 UTC,"Thats a relief, I was expecting a completely different response. I suspect the irony will fall to Poe's Law. I'm certain the writer is not creating a parody."
RedditDayOf,3dtp9v,blahbah,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:16 2015 UTC,Love the reference to Poe's Law as a high school English teacher and I agree it was not in the author intent
RedditDayOf,3dtp9v,baskandpurr,2,Sun Jul 19 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"I don't get it.  EDIT: genuinely curious BTW, i don't understand both your comment and the reason for OP to post this article."
RedditDayOf,3dtp9v,blahbah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"Today's subject is suffering and the sub is full of some of the worst torments that can befall or be applied to a human. Garroting, scaphism, martyrdom and the emotional pain of people who care for people with alzheimers. There is plenty of suffering to go around.  This article uses the terms suffering and torture in the interpretation of the treatment of group of fictional people by another group of people. Nobody actually suffers from nuances of the portrayal of Wonder Woman in comics or film. A word that means to exist in state of continuous physical or emotional pain is being applied to what is effectively trivia. Probably in an attempt to give the complaint relevance that it does not justify.  Poe's Law states that, without some clear indication, it is difficult to tell fundamentalism from a parody of that fundamentaliam. In this case, OP posted this article as an ironic commentary on the misapropriation of suffering. However, readers might assume that OP genuinely considers this suffering."

RedditDayOf,3dlrwg,johpick,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:39 2015 UTC,Sunlight reflected off the spray would be my guess. It glows relative to the surroundings because the ash doesn't reflect much.
