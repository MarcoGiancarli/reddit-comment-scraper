streetphotography,3e6586,levindixon,4,Wed Jul 22 06:38:25 2015 UTC,"It's better than most images taken by brand new practitioners. Your subject's eye contact and gesture are strong, but especially good is the diagonal line of the lights in the cafe that lead to your subject and the reading light partially obscuring her face. Did you shoot it from your phone specifically for instagram or crop it from an image shot with your camera? It feels like there should be more to the frame that would extend the image beyond the realms of being simply an interesting street portrait. To see what I mean, have a look at John Goldsmith's shot that the Photographer's Gallery infamously appropriated (stole) https://www.flickr.com/photos/waxypoetic/2489942238/"
streetphotography,3e6586,martinparrslovechild,3,Wed Jul 22 07:59:50 2015 UTC,"You have what 99% of the images here don't, an interesting subject with an interesting gesture. Good stuff mate, look forward to seeing your photography develop :)    If this was shot horizontally, it would be nice to see 1/2 of so of the plant on the left, it should nicely complement the left side of the frame which is a little lacking."
streetphotography,3e2q43,rustygee,2,Tue Jul 21 14:35:57 2015 UTC,Somewhere I feel you needed another leg sticking out to make this image go from ok to great.  Perhaps from the table behind him or the table back and to the right or even the little pizza dude on the wall.
streetphotography,3e2q43,haggertyjmn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:52:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree. I wish there was more going on in the scene to give it that extra push because the man was a good subject. Too bad there was not much else. Thank you.
streetphotography,3e3q0x,piercesapper,4,Tue Jul 21 18:48:32 2015 UTC,I like your enthusiasm for your own work but honestly none of the details you describe do anything for me and or I can't make out the details that you are describing. That strong diagonal is not helping your situation if you want viewers to notice what is happening on the other side of the window. Also I feel if you can't control your verticals and horizontals your not in control of photographing the scene.
streetphotography,3e3q0x,haggertyjmn,2,Tue Jul 21 19:43:21 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more with you. I didn't pay any attention to the horizontal line going across the image. Thank you
streetphotography,3e3q0x,jolars,2,Tue Jul 21 20:06:40 2015 UTC,Things I like: Girls face is blocked by the metal box (not sure what that's called haha). One hand of the girl is placed in front of her and the other is placed on her mother. The woman's expression is also a little interesting. I like the reflections. The scratches on the window also add a nice touch.  Things I don't like: Reflections might be a bit too distracting from the woman and the girl. Scratches on the window make the woman's expression hard to see. Sky is too bright. Also a bit distracting IMO.  What you all think?
streetphotography,3e02he,rustygee,5,Mon Jul 20 22:35:28 2015 UTC,"Right side of frame, great. Left side, not so much."
streetphotography,3e02he,Nonchalant_Elephant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:56 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for the comprehensive illustration! Some things you pointed out I didn't even catch! I know there is a lot of empty space but it seemed whichever way I cropped I lost some of that leading lines into the subjects and decided to keep it what do you suggest I do? Or do you think Keeping it with my vision is fine as it is? Once again thanks so much.
streetphotography,3e02he,Nonchalant_Elephant,2,Tue Jul 21 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"Not sure if there's a lot you can do now to rectify the empty space. Maybe change your crop ratio (unless your strict on staying with 16:9?) 3:2 will take some of the left out, but there'll still be a lot left behind. You could crop it portrait, focusing in on the two men and the pointers, but that's a big change to the effective focal length yada yada~.   Okay, so I just had a play around with the crop. Noticed the original ratio was even wider than 16:9 - generally stick to the tried and trued ratio's for best results. I switched it up to 3:2 and cropped heavily - http://i.imgur.com/ofAHF3I.jpg  I'm not sure if it's any better. Those leading lines going away from the subjects are sucking the life out of it. They lead to the empty space and my eye gets bored.  Image might have been better composed slightly closer with the subjects on the left of frame. They are moving towards the right, so it's nicer to have any empty space in front of them."
streetphotography,3e02he,Nonchalant_Elephant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:54 2015 UTC,"So here is the original no edit or crop, downscaled a bit, for a perspective on the crop http://i.imgur.com/cRpBipS.jpg  I like the idea of using the 3:2 but not entirely sure more so than the 16:9. That said I will have to politely disagree with you that the lines that lead to nothing suck a lot from the image. It feels to me as the are leading to the subjects rather than away from them, but that is just a personal opinion and I realize that it's not how everyone else will view it.  Given the original what could have been done better in terms of cropping from your view. I am pretty happy with my results so far but I do know there is room for improvement.  Once again thank you for the critique! Cropping and framing is definitely not a strong suite of mine especially when I am getting used to moving from my trusty 50mm to 35mm in the past few weeks, it has been a real challenge forcing me to get even closer."
streetphotography,3e04zm,feist1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:54:53 2015 UTC,I think your other images have been stronger.  The subject is mundane and smack in the middle of the frame playing with her phone.  Doesn't seem to be anything else going on unless I'm missing something?

streetphotography,3dxuhg,Hates_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"thanks.  i was torn about straightening. there is massive complex distortion on this lens (samyang 14mm). i think the horizon is actually straight relative to the marquees on the left and right. if i correct the distortion, all the lines are straight, and i prefer them a little trippy and dreamlike as they are.  still, i agree with you that the horizon at the center slopes down toward the right and this is distracting. i think this asymmetry resulted from my cropping to get the dude in the middle."
streetphotography,3dxuhg,Hates_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"It's more personal taste. I'm a stickler for straight lines, I think it's perfectly reasonable for them not to be straight it that's your style."
streetphotography,3dxuhg,EpicSunWarrior,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:32:08 2015 UTC,There seems to be a lot of dead space on the top and bottom. How does cropping it to 16:9 look like? It might look more balanced and have a more cinematic feel.
streetphotography,3dynxf,Keenan_RIVALS,8,Mon Jul 20 16:37:18 2015 UTC,Trying to brand/market yourself too early might be getting in the way of pushing yourself as a street photographer.
streetphotography,3dynxf,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"A good way to recount the scene and see what you could have done better.  It seems like it would be especially helpful on improving your timing by being able to look back and see how far you were off / on.  The first time I've seen someone do that was during the filming of War Photographer by James Nachtwey.  The film crew hooked up a video camera to the top of his camera body.  It was very insightful to watch as he shot some pretty intense situations.   It's worth a watch, I think the SP crowd can relate to his photography even if your not into journalism. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHU2TOhjuS0"

streetphotography,3dwouw,BBA935,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:42:59 2015 UTC,Interesting subjects but I think the framing could have been better. The space on the left is distracting as well as the far person facing right. I'm not sure I like the first man being out of focus. The leading lines are great. It may have been as simple as a step to the left and trying to place both men at the ends at opposing corners.

streetphotography,3dy5b6,stonejoyunderground,6,Mon Jul 20 14:20:07 2015 UTC,"Good grief. 271 photos in the set makes it hard to give any useful feedback apart from: you need to start to develop your self-editing skills. Put these images away for six months, come back to them when you're less emotionally attached, and be ruthless with your edit - you might find that none of them are keepers. In terms of street photography, you might also find that you get better results at home rather than abroad. Parke, T., Autio, N. and Marlow, J. are obviously ones to check out, but also have a look at the work of the Oculi collective. The flickr group www.flickr.com/groups/aussiestreet is also a good starting point."
streetphotography,3dy5b6,martinparrslovechild,7,Mon Jul 20 20:40:51 2015 UTC,Cull down your photos severely first. I don't have the time to curate your 271 holiday photos for you. The majority of which barely qualify as street photography.  When you cull down the photos I might then take a look at them and offer advice.   If you don't know what street photography is take a look at the iN-PUBLic website and the Magnum Photos website.
streetphotography,3dy5b6,DillonVFX,2,Mon Jul 20 14:33:02 2015 UTC,There are some good photos in there but like the other guy said you really need to cull a lot of them. Too many of them are really similar right off the bat from what I can see.   I'm currently at the end of my 3 weeks backpacking trip in Myanmar and I took around 3500 photos this trip so far and I'm planning to only show 20-30 photos. 1% seems to be a pretty good rate I think. I know it's hard to do because you probably have a lot of emotional attachment to those photos but it's something that must be done. Viewers don't have any emotional attachment to your photos. They only take everything by their face value.  And also a lot of the photos here aren't really street photography. Not that it's a bad thing but you probably will be better off calling it travel photography then street photography.  It's hard to give you advice when you are showing 270 photos. I don't even have 270 photos in all of my flickr and I have taken around 20k photos up until this point.

streetphotography,3dt0lr,moshtrocity,4,Sun Jul 19 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"Good colour and the trust Jeebus kid is a strong subject. The bad news is that the rest of the scene and the background is a busy mess that distracts. You're definitely on the right track with this image, but you may need to work the scene or approach it differently to find a composition that highlights your subject or creates a reading path for the viewer's eye. In this sense, less is sometimes more. Have a look at the work of Manos or Gruyaert and try to think about how they transform potentially busy or messy scenes into readable photographs."
streetphotography,3dt0lr,martinparrslovechild,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything said here.

streetphotography,3dt0lr,wsteinh,5,Mon Jul 20 03:14:34 2015 UTC,"Well, what I meant was potentially busy - so images that could be busy, messy and illegible, but the photographer has managed to use all their skills (and perhaps luck plays a role too) to transform such a scene into something composed, coherent and readable.

Maybe it's tasteless, maybe it isn't, but street photography has a focus on candid images. There's no point asking that man to pose and smile to the camera, or asking if he can take a picture of the man.  Regardless, the subject could be only making that face for a split second, or that be his resting face. It doesn't speak towards his dislike of OP taking his image in that very split second."

Google ""Street photography from <your birthyear +10years> "" and that will take you back to when you were in 5th grade. Awesome.  However, jerks like this ruin it for everybody. Taking pictures of people in swimsuits and calling it street photography will do nothing for the genre except to paint all street photographers as perverts and eventually lead to restrictions on photography in public places.   It's coming folks, and it will be sad."
streetphotography,3df2cc,ja647,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"I really don't see restrictions coming. Look at all the changes that have come from citizens photographing the police. This is something that used to get you thrown on the ground and cuffed, and while that may still happen in some areas, the police are generally getting used to it and some police are even wearing cameras themselves. While I realize this argument is specific to police, it applies generally as well because these are citizens exercising their rights in the same way street photographers use their rights. I do not see any legislation being passed that would take this away. Not to mention court cases have already set precedents protecting street photography. This is of course all in the USA (assuming you were speaking about the USA)."

streetphotography,3dbnga,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:38 2015 UTC,Nice!  I'm not sure about the portrait orientation and the doors. Maybe step inside next time or do a landscape/square crop. Use the doors as a geometrical element but it needs to be more important or not there.  I like the mood of the office alot.
streetphotography,3dbnga,tookootookoo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:24:04 2015 UTC,"My exact critique on this as well... landscape. The subject / window is what is important on the inside, not the floor"

streetphotography,3d94gd,mj1176,3,Tue Jul 14 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"Came to say exactly this; good photo but the post is a bit much. What I'm guessing happened is that the kids were a bit underexposed as all the white of the soap threw off the meter. If the OP had subsequently adjusted the exposure compensation after this shot, that might've been just the time where the kids' overlap mentioned in another comment resolved itself, as well as helping to fix the exposure leaving less to fix in post.  Edit to add: that girl's head on the left is great."
streetphotography,3d94gd,lidocaineus,7,Tue Jul 14 18:56:14 2015 UTC,"It's a good image, but I think it would benefit more from being in black-and-white than color. Just my two cents. I like the composition and feel like b&w will be perfect for this image."

streetphotography,3d9av3,SleepingPodOne,3,Tue Jul 14 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"Chinatown and the Financial District are really fun for street photography. The Financial District has some great light during the day where pockets of sun creep between buildings. In Chinatown people barely give a crap about you having a camera.   Midtown is also a good location for street photography. People are just hustling through and many don't care for you having a camera.   Avoid Times Square and anywhere near the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Full of fake characters, tourists, and the PABT is pretty much a shithole."
streetphotography,3d9av3,shotbyelisa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! I already planned on avoiding Times Square, it's just like Chicago's Navy pier and magnificent mile.

streetphotography,3d9av3,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:30:32 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the tip. I'm probably going to do that walk first thing when I get to New York.
streetphotography,3d9av3,arteryal,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"Ok this idea that one spot is going to give you more keepers is obviously crazy. And what spot could possibly be uninteresting, assuming it has lots of people? We're taking photographs after all, and a photograph's effectiveness depends on the photographer. You seem to think finding the perfect spot is gonna improve your pictures or help you get good shots, which just could never be true. Hate to be the grinch, but I promise you that every street photographer you admire would say the same thing. There is gold in every place that has people. Just look.   But anyway, Chinatown is my personal favorite for my own subjective preferences. It's gritty and smelly and hustle and bustle is coming at you from all directions. I guarantee you Bay Ridge is really interesting as well, for entirely different reasons.  Happy shootin :)"
streetphotography,3d9av3,lidocaineus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:58:45 2015 UTC,"I wasn't implying that one spot is going to give me the best photos, but as someone who lives in the city with lots of different neighborhoods to shoot in, I do know that there are places that are typically dull and rarely provide interesting context for my subjects. I definitely don't think that the spot I am in nor the camera I am using somehow makes my photographs good. I'm just trying to find interesting locations that will help inspire me and give me more unique things to shoot so I don't waste all of my time finding a spot.   Thanks for the tips! I love my local Chinatown for similar reasons, and I've only briefly hung out in nyc's"
streetphotography,3d49ca,feist1,2,Mon Jul 13 12:02:08 2015 UTC,It would be nice to have this composed so that the right guy was out of the frame. That way the pole separates the couple from the others.
streetphotography,3d49ca,termoose,2,Mon Jul 13 13:39:29 2015 UTC,"thanks for the feedback. maybe, but I do kinda like the man on the far right. what would be the aim of having the pole between the couple and the other two on the left? people together vs people alone on their phone? (edit: the guy on the far left is reading a map, not his phone)"
streetphotography,3d49ca,soundstripe,2,Mon Jul 13 20:52:59 2015 UTC,I think I like the composition of the people but the fence and background is a little distracting. Not much you can do about that though =).  I think if I cropped someone out as termoose suggested it would be the guy on the left. That way both the phone and the pole are separating the blond guy from the others.

streetphotography,3d49ca,paulatthehug,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yup,  the lack of feet on foreground man was a loss. Talking of which I'd be tempted to clone out that cable in the sky top right."

streetphotography,3d49ca,haggertyjmn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"Oh well, that's street photography for you.  As for photoshop me neither, but that's cos I have a Linux desktop so use gimp but it does much the same sort of stuff. That sort of object, where the background is randomly noisy but only slowly changing overall hue and brightness, is usually easy to clone out using a clone brush. I screen grabbed part of your image and did it a quick and dirty job on it here. That took about five minutes tops so it's a trick worth learning (IMO,  YMMV etc :-))   Edit: hmmm, looked OK on this monitor, less good on my tablet. Needs to smudge it a bit. Well, anyway, you get the idea. If that's what I can do in under five minutes you can do a better job if you take your time over it."
streetphotography,3d49ca,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:34:14 2015 UTC,Hm yeah. Although I might end up cropping it out and keeping the number of people/groups at 3
streetphotography,3d49ca,paulatthehug,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think cropping at the top is the way, as /u/haggertyjmn was suggesting less sky wouldn't do any harm.  But if you're going to crop to three people I don't agree with /u/termoose - I'd lose the guy of the left.  Think I still prefer it with four groups though."
streetphotography,3d49ca,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:06:00 2015 UTC,"Cropping, when I suggested it I meant in camera during the capture. Not that you can go back and do it.  Hopefully you can be more conscience of where your cropping people when you get in a similar situation."

streetphotography,3d49ca,scenesofnewyorkcity,0,Tue Jul 14 19:54:13 2015 UTC,"I think that if you want to take SP seriously, you have to shy away from editing out entire elements from the frame."
streetphotography,3d3w6g,nuno_cruz,2,Mon Jul 13 08:59:20 2015 UTC,"The strong division in the frame created by the sky/lines and between the dark/light is very cool; and the fact that the subjects are facing opposite directions, each looking in to those divided parts of the frame, also very cool.   However, you have all these leading lines going to the center of the frame, and ideally, that's where you would want the division of subjects to be. You could have taken a step to the left and framed it so the leading lines literally split them apart, to add drama to that whole division/opposites/dark/light/good/bad vibe.   Also, unfortunately, there is no actual content to compliment this theme of dark/light/separation. There is nothing in either subject to suggest darkness or light or good or bad or any differences at all really. They both have no emotion on their face and are simply existing, with nothing remarkable. So the compositional effort feels very forced with no content to compliment it. It's a shame that one wasn't laughing with a big smile and the other scowling, etc. Also it's a shame there isn't some interesting content going on to the right/left, or alternatively, complete emptiness to the right/left, to draw attention to them. As it is, there is just some random stuff to the right and left sides of the frame, which is definitely giving us a sense of place, but not adding too much to the scene.   Definitely a cool attempt! :)"
streetphotography,3d68rq,soundstripe,2,Mon Jul 13 21:11:43 2015 UTC,I feel for getting the intimacy of the fight the framing is too wide I.e. Too far away and there's so much added space. The added space brings in other elements that cause reason for focus I.e. The lady.
streetphotography,3d68rq,sochac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:58:45 2015 UTC,Thanks that's kind of what I was thinking.
streetphotography,3d68rq,newsnewsbooze,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:11:46 2015 UTC,without the title i thought the photo was about the two in the foreground. so I echo sochac in saying try some cropping. My only other thought is I don't think the color adds anything to the photo so maybe try b+w.
streetphotography,3d68rq,nameBrandon,2,Mon Jul 13 23:06:43 2015 UTC,Tried out the crop + b/w.  I think next time I will try to get closer =). Thanks for your comments.

Not sure it's even strong enough after all that work to stand on its own, but I have plenty of practice trying to make something out of nothing, so I figured I've give it a go..  http://i.imgur.com/phlTgno.jpg  Anyway, I would still go through and clean up the dodge/burn a bit, so it doesn't look so over the top, but you get the idea. I like the lady in the foreground, because if her face is in the shadows, her body angle is almost close enough where you can imply that she's watching these guys fight. I think it adds a cool layer to the image.  I still think I'd end up binning it, but I know how hard it is to let go when you get thaaaat cloose to a really good shot, and just miss it. :("

streetphotography,3d422z,arteryal,3,Mon Jul 13 10:26:18 2015 UTC,I like shots of mundane things. This one's pushing it though. Perhaps if there was more/stronger repetition of the off-kilter angle it would work.
streetphotography,3d422z,Nonchalant_Elephant,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"Mmm, it depends. I personally like that there's plenty of straight lines because it draws out the slant more and almost personifies the bench."
streetphotography,3d422z,VeinyPickle,3,Mon Jul 13 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"The three trees lend a nice balance to the frame and the off-kilter bench works, but it feels like an image that would be best utilised within the context of a set or series. It could play well in a project on slightly off or unbalanced ordinary objects, for example, or could connect to other shots through leitmotif etc. It's, on one hand, a shot of park bench, but on the other it is one that I'd say has potential."

streetphotography,3d422z,THRILLPOW3R,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it would be more interesting in portrait, just capturing the slanted bench and slanted background tree. It does mean you have less going on around the frame, but it sort of works with the bench. Try cropping this one just to get an idea for it and then go back and compose a more proper portrait version.   I hate when people save others photos and edit them so I won't do that, but just a suggestion."

streetphotography,3d11y5,blackbirdrising,5,Sun Jul 12 17:10:23 2015 UTC,You missed a literal framing element that you could've utilized if you had taken one step to the left. It's overwhelmingly distracting in its current position.

Sometimes there needn't be a deeper meaning, and humour seems to be a rare thing in street photography.  To clarify, I mean like circumstantial humour... not just interesting or silly looking subjects doing funny faces or poses.   I do however agree with everything else. Needs to be closer, less of the left."
streetphotography,3czksz,mrzo,7,Sun Jul 12 05:26:40 2015 UTC,"You almost have something but it's probably not what you expect: the palm trees + your subject could make for a good image. The line of palm trees on the right with him as one of the trees would be fun. Or the three palm trees in the top third of the frame with his head as the ""fourth"" tree.  Or not; the height similarity is what is catching my eye but that's where it ends. It might not be strong enough by itself without a ton of isolation or clever framing. Car bisecting subject; this is worse than something just touching a subject. Now you eye follows a through-line that cuts the guy practically in the middle. Street light stabbing subject. Back of head shot. Right arm amputated. Left hand cut off (photo 101: try not to cut people at joints). Weird thing coming out of his pocket.  Background / rest of the frame is full of uninteresting things. Title doesn't make sense; he's probably listening to something. The street is obviously not silent. Underexposed, but not really an issue because there's nothing to expose properly. You exposed for the sky but there's nothing in the sky. May be improved by going for a full silhouette but the content's still not interesting."
streetphotography,3cuwkd,anderyoung,4,Fri Jul 10 23:46:43 2015 UTC,"It's not bad, but it doesn't come together.  The guy's face on the left is somewhat interesting, but I don't feel it references anything else in the frame that would elevate it. He's not looking at anything in particular and he's not echoing any of what the women are doing further in the frame. There's sort of a feeling of spatial separation due to the doorway / wall, but it doesn't really add up to much. You've also cut him off.    Because of the way they're generally turned in a certain direction there's the possibility of a connection between the guy and the standing woman but it could've been far stronger if they were at least looking the same way.  Minor: someone playing with phone. The grain is pretty ugly here because it's so distracting; it just looks like sensor noise."
streetphotography,3cuwkd,lidocaineus,5,Sat Jul 11 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"Grainy doesn't matter, shutter blur doesn't matter, sharpness doesn't matter, under-exposing doesn't really matter - it's content and the composition in which you show that content that is king. And, this image, like most others, doesn't really have any compelling content. There's no connection between the bored youth on the left of the frame and the group on the right - a juxtaposition of this sort will very rarely look anything but forced."

The couple's embrace reminds me of one of Alex Webb's very famous images. Unfortunately, as Dillon points out, your background choice and composition kill this shot. It's a busy mess of nothing. If you can shoot this location again, think about depth and how what's in your background can balance your foreground subject."
streetphotography,3cmicp,martinparrslovechild,2,Thu Jul 9 02:57:44 2015 UTC,"Alright, thank you for the advice! How would you suggest balancing the background and foreground with something like this?"
streetphotography,3cmicp,martinparrslovechild,2,Thu Jul 9 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, have a look at some compositions that use depth effectively, where foreground and background come together coherently. They don't have to be photographs either - paintings can help you learn this well because everything in them is deliberately constructed. But perhaps two of the best at creating documentary/street images where foreground subjects are balanced by backgrounds, are Alex Webb and Jason Eskenazi. Have a look at Webb's 'The Suffering of Light' gallery on the Magnum website (or, better still, buy the book) and you can see how he uses separation and careful composition to create deep, layered, textual photographs. Backgrounds can be busy, buy I'd suggest when you're starting out to keep things more minimal and within your control. For the scene here, using the buildings in the background as well as the frame created by the awning and beams might get you a better composed image."
streetphotography,3cmicp,emkat,2,Thu Jul 9 07:23:52 2015 UTC,"Wow I think you have a great eye. Definitely reminds me of Alex Webb. However, I think the background shot has to be more interesting to make it a better photo: there is not much of a story in the back.  Also the composition is a bit strange with the building being cut right down the middle.   But I think it's still a very good concept."
streetphotography,3cmicp,DillonVFX,-5,Thu Jul 9 06:49:44 2015 UTC,"You know how to use light in an interesting way but your background is awful. A few steps to the left would've helped and also getting closer to your subjects to create some emotional intimacy.   You should also clean up the negative in photoshop/lightroom before presenting it. Whenever I see film photos with dust, scratches and water spots it just tells me the photographer is lazy."
streetphotography,3cmicp,DillonVFX,3,Thu Jul 9 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my biggest problem was with how busy the background was.  My film was scanned in my local shop, and the scans were really low quality, sorry. :("

streetphotography,3coo2n,feist1,2,Thu Jul 9 15:20:19 2015 UTC,definitely better than the dog and couple shot. the composition works although you could have crouched down a bit more and chopped off the guy in the front's head or something to get rid of the negative space in the upper right and give some sort of interest to the man in the front in relation to the people in the background.
streetphotography,3coo2n,nvcholas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:05:16 2015 UTC,hm all agreed. I've tried a tighter crop and it improves it somewhat...not sure by how much though. the front man isn't that interesting which makes the image not too interesting I think.

In my eye, I thought there was an interesting visual metaphor to be made from the older brother's positioning between his little brother and whatever lay unseen around the bend.  Unfortunately, it seems I didn't have enough skill to communicate my intent, and wasted your time with a boring photo, for which I apologize. Could you suggest how I could have conveyed this more successfully?

streetphotography,3ck54p,kleetimm,3,Wed Jul 8 15:20:29 2015 UTC,The scene lacks any interesting moment. As a colour photo you haven't got several different colour elements in the shot working together to create interest. It also doesn't cause any emotional reaction like having a funny visual pun for example.   I'm sure it would be popular on Instagram to all the urban landscape fans out there but it's not good as photo in the street photography genre.

streetphotography,3chkd5,piercesapper,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:31:18 2015 UTC,"When self-evaluating pictures, you need to separate your perceptions of the circumstances and context in which the image was made, and the actual content in the photograph that results. It's hard to do. You may see a 'surprised' expression, but it is difficult for the viewer to see from the angle and framing of your photo - the man may well have been surprised, but this does not translate to the viewer. The same with the gesture or lack thereof. The focus and technicalities aren't really an issue, but what definitely kills this one is the misuse of space. Most of your frame is wasted, the figures awkwardly cropped and your composition leads the viewer's eye towards the vacant and dark left hand side of the frame. Ask yourself, 'where will the viewer's eye go when they look at my image?' and 'Is this where I wanted the viewer to look?

Things I don't like: The negative space it a bit boring. Not a whole lot of context. It's not so obvious that there is a third person at the left.

Check out this group for some inspiration for your next shoot at the beach: https://www.flickr.com/groups/1745554@N23/"

streetphotography,3cb2yu,Hates_,3,Mon Jul 6 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"Charlie kirk's: 10 ways to improve your street photography without shooting people.   Take pictures of urban landscapes but make sure that there are no overlapping objects.  Do the same, but deliberately overlap a foreground object with a background object to make something new. Perhaps connect lines in the frame that are at different perspective points. See Blake Andrews' line ups or the work of Siegfried Hansen.  Try to guess your exposures while walking around, using ISO 400, 1/500 or f11 as a base. Many experienced photographers don't even need to use a meter.  Learn how close you need to be to the subject depending on your preferred focal length. Eg how close do I need to be for a head shot, a waist up shot and a full body shot. And then learn where these distance markings are on your lens and learn to judge those distances. Do the same, but this time try kneeling a bit or squatting. Observe how much you need to do this to move heads to the upper part of the frame. Then try the same but in order to get eyes in the corner. Learn your preferred shooting area like the back of your hand. Know where the light comes from at different points in the year, where interesting backgrounds are, observe the flow of people at different parts of the day. Shoot these areas without people in them and try to  preconceive how they will look with people.  Related to the above, watch people at different distances and try to predict when they will intersect. Then move your body to try to be near that intersecting point so that you could take their picture. Also look for muddled groups of people that are relatively still and try to move around them to see if, at one angle, they are nicely spaced. You can even try this with action figures, dolls etc. Practice walking down the street with your camera raised constantly to your eye. But don't take a picture. Observe the responses you get from people.  Try walking down the street smiling and looking happy. See how people respond. Try the same but looking grumpy.  Befriend interesting people in your local area and find out what's really going on there. Perhaps join some interesting clubs or societies. Photo opportunities are everywhere, especially if you are in interesting places or with interesting people.  For flash users, consider buying a mannequin. This will help you work out the correct flash exposure at different distances. It will also help with framing exercises. See 4 above."

The format is pretty much the contact sheet, then a page of the story of the shot and why the photographer chose it, then a blown-up image of the shot. It's great for learning how and why photographers shoot a certain way (Martin Parr and Bruce Gilden are the more prominent ones I can think of from the book) and how they make a selection or read which is their strongest. That's some practical skills that everybody including me needs to work on. It also makes you realise that street photography is 98% luck, 2% skill. The more you shoot, the more of a chance that something occurs."

streetphotography,3cbjyj,arteryal,2,Mon Jul 6 22:04:44 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting thing to consider. Certainly, a street photographer's success rate is extraordinarily low because of the difficulty of the genre. But I wouldn't say that the ratio of luck to skill is 98/2. I think the best practitioners have the skill-set, that when a chance moment or good scene presents itself, they know how to make a decent image out of it. And then, still, most of the time the photographs that result are failures. There is also persistence and patience. When asked about the element of luck in his photography, Winogrand gave something along the lines of the old sporting maxim: 'the more I shoot, the more luck I have' and encouraged students to take as many pictures as possible to 'increase the odds' of getting something."

You might think you're creating a 'frame within the frame' with this kind of composition, but in actuality it's bland and wasted space.  4 - As above, but if you're trying to play with scale/ perspective, you should be more precise with your lines. https://www.flickr.com/photos/simonpaulkossoff/5815870126/  5 - All those people dressed in black might make for an interesting image, but this isn't it. The silver hand rail acts as a barrier between you and your subjects and, by extension, between your viewer and your subjects.   6 - Another well peopled scene, but again there are too much overlap and not enough depth. Ask yourself, 'where will the viewer's eye go when they look at my image?' and 'Is this where I wanted the viewer to look?'  7 - Nothing of interest here. Another overlap that distracts. Keep trying though, people on benches can be interesting http://www.in-public.com/MattStuart/image/3389  8 - 75% of your frame is wasted here with shadow and building. The rest contains another messy subject.   9 - A bit of a HCB decisive puddle-jump cliche, which lacks the context to give us more than a reflected building and an awkwardly dismembered body.   10 - Your closest to having something interesting.

Don't fight light. You will always lose   Use right brain when shooting, left brain when looking over contact sheets. Paraphrased, this becomes... Shoot first, ask questions later"

streetphotography,3c91gw,Hates_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:43:17 2015 UTC,"Just a friendly suggestion, but did you try a vertical? That might have helped with the cutting off of the hand gesture (it also would have shown more of her clothing too) and also the large amounts of blank space in the rest of the photo... I like your subject though, she is indeed beautiful.   Oh, and the next time you try taking a portrait like this, regardless of whether you choose to take a horizontal or vertical, try placing the subject's eyes near the top third of the picture. I've been looking at some impressionist paintings recently and whenever the subject is a person their eyes are almost always placed at or near the top third of the frame...this practice likely goes back a lot further than impressionism, but either way, I think doing this fills the frame, but more importantly makes the viewer gravitate towards the subject's eyes....or so I've heard.   Here's an example:  http://www.edgar-degas.org/Self-portrait.html  and another one, even when the subject is somewhat far off, he places their eyes near the top of the frame...  http://www.edgar-degas.org/Two-Dancers-in-the-Studio-I.html  anyway, sorry for the long post, I hope this helps you, good luck..."

I meant the previous packs released by VSCO. They did at times offer a grungy edgy type of image, which I've tuned and applied to my portraiture work.   These new presets however offer a more vibrant outlook, while still maintaining a slight film look. I apologize if the images weren't deep enough for you, they were honestly just documents of my day. There were no homeless people. Just a guy resting. Nor were the women irritated, perhaps uncomfortable in front of the camera, like most people.   However I do appreciate your condescending response.

streetphotography,3c5at4,noselfies,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:54:24 2015 UTC,The cutting off at the elbow and the distracting background are what let this down. Overall the composition could be changed to make this a better photo. The closed eyes is a big distraction. Perhaps the clown is blind? Maybe there's something that could have been included in the frame to tell that story. Why is the clown sad? I don't get the feeling that he is.

It's the kind of work that keeps you looking around for the absurdity, especially once you know that you are, in fact, looking for something amiss. I think some of the images are more successful at this than others, but it does make me want to go out on the streets to look for images like that. By comparison, I don't feel like I think as deep into the frame as he does in his images. I tend to focus on an expression, or a moment in someones face, and not on what is going on around that person. I think that next time I go out, I'm going to have to practice looking more deeply into the frame.  Thanks for sharing this!"

streetphotography,3bxqfw,haggertyjmn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:45:26 2015 UTC,But that is the fine line I'm talking about.  Should camping a street shot then deemed a semi portrait.  You have to admit once you setup the camp stakes and especially if you're revisiting a shot you have lost some of the spontaneity.
streetphotography,3bxqfw,haggertyjmn,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:08:25 2015 UTC,"In one scenario you have explicit control of the scene, you move the elements to create the shot. What you're essentially capturing is an image that you set up with the loss of candidness to the image. You capture something that is set up by yourself, and not something that will occur naturally and without interference.  In another scenario, you wait for the scene to play out. For example, someone trips over some stairs. Would someone never trip over those same stairs for the rest of time? Let's say you decide to capture someone tripping over those stairs since you've seen it happen. You set up camp and wait days and days, working on the scene. You finally capture the shot of someone tripping over stairs and captured it. Would you argue that the person tripping this second time around has no spontaneity? What about the shot, is it candid? Did you capture the reaction of the person tripping with no direct input from yourself that would impact on the image and event?"
streetphotography,3bxqfw,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:30:57 2015 UTC,"Tripping, lets say you set up a street shot.  You are trying to orchestrate ten people to move in certain way based on a shot you have imagined in your head. One guy trips by accident and it's not what you have planned but that becomes the shot are we back to being street?  The tripping occurs naturally without interference and his falling reaction is candid.  Another scenario... Car camping,  lets forget the tripping part. You just need a person to walk through a shadow.  The original shot was a made a half second too early.  You return to the scene and set up the shot exactly the way it was the day before.  As a matter of fact you put your camera on a tripod bring a 30"" monitor and shoot tethered with a remote. You do some test frames and have a assistant walk through the shot  so you can time exactly when to shoot it.  Now we clear the scene and wait for random people to walk by. No need to wait for days since it is a busy street. The shot is nailed with the first person that walks by."
streetphotography,3bxqfw,VeinyPickle,5,Fri Jul 3 12:32:55 2015 UTC,"I would argue that this is a form of 'working the scene'. But in your example it goes great lengths just to make sure that the photo is nailed perfectly.   Would it be considered street? In my books, yes. I won't care about the process, I'll only care about the photo. The situation has to be candid, not the photographer. The photographer has every means to control their composition and anything else technical except for what's moving or not within the photographer's control."
streetphotography,3bxqfw,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:52:01 2015 UTC,I agree with this...  I'm just throwing ideas out there for conversation.  It gets trickier as MFO below adds in interacting with the subject. Like using flash for instance. That could be seen as manipulating the scene and also causing unnatural reactions.    I will say one thing that I personally find to heighten the experience of Street Photography in either my own work or looking at others is spontaneity of finding the shot.  Which to me adds a certain step above in my mind then a revisit.  For instance if It were announced that all of Joseph Koudelka's shots were made by revisiting. I would still appreciated them but not in the way I do now.
streetphotography,3bxqfw,PrincipalPoop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:13:13 2015 UTC,A lack of spontaneity doesn't override the fact that the moment is still authentic/unposed and would have happened with or without you being there.  You just happen to be in a better position to capture it.  It's a difference between reacting to the enviornment in front of you and interacting/manipulating the environment. I've seen some photographers that do the latter be classified as street but personally that destroys what I find so fascinating about SP.

streetphotography,3bvz4a,THRILLPOW3R,2,Thu Jul 2 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm on the fence about this one. I generally tend to give photos that stand on aesthetic/geometric merits alone a little more credit than I probably should, but they work particularly well as a series theme and I think this has potential. The spiky top edges of the large shadows add a little more visual interest than if they were just squared off, and the consistency of having all of the man but his head silhouetted helps him sort of sink into the context of those shadows. The ac unit and the rectangle next to it being lined up in the well-lot area above the man contribute to the interesting geometry as well. The thing is, after that it's just sort of...done. Doesn't hold a lot of interest after that initial viewing, which isn't too much of an issue if it's part of a set but it makes it that much harder for the photo to stand on its own. I hate to advocate cropping, but I think maybe it wouldn't hurt here to cut just a small amount from the bottom and right edges to help focus on the more interesting elements without removing the mass of those black areas. Thanks for posting."
streetphotography,3bvz4a,mj1176,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the detailed response. I'm sometimes embarrassed when people pick up on things that I hadn't even considered in situ. I knew the shadows looked interesting, I knew I wanted someone walking between the shadow pillars.   Beyond that I didn't actually know there was a light patch at head-level and the air-con box was happenstance and didn't factor into my (at least conscious) framing. But that said, you're right that it'd probably work better as part of a series. Maybe even one exploiting this patch for different shots of visually interesting subjects passing by - though perhaps a bit repetitive. Maybe one of people passing through pillars of light in general? Not sure.  RE: Cropping, it actually was cropped 1:1 and I felt it looked quite good but I'm trying to stay away from cropping and going with my gut as far as only really adjusting my horizons if I need it and otherwise settling with what I got out of camera framing/crop/distance-from-subject wise. This all being part of an effort to get better in-camera shots as well as to encourage myself to get closer to subjects."

All of the images you've posted so far are very basic, of single individuals doing nothing in particular, from the same distance, same perspective, same background, etc. There's nothing at all wrong with that, but these are all effectively the same image:    http://i.imgur.com/n7SzfPz.jpg http://i.imgur.com/vYAsvEo.jpg http://i.imgur.com/FNeLrxj.jpg http://i.imgur.com/6Bfjkdn.jpg"
streetphotography,3bujby,DillonVFX,5,Thu Jul 2 14:01:36 2015 UTC,I don't why you're getting downvoted. What you're saying is completely true. There's taking photos for a series with a concept in mind that connects each photo to each other and then there's boring the viewer by making them look at what's essentially the same photo over and over.

Just because it's a single street doesn't mean that you can't get interesting/dynamic images with more depth.  The only thing limiting you is your eye.

streetphotography,3bxikf,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"I think the guy in the back right is what makes this image stand out a little and I assume that's why you also found it compelling. I don't think it's enough to carry it though because, as others pointed out, its a little chaotic for the eye.  I think that if there had been more space around that guy though, he might have stood out more and it would have been more compelling...because I do like him.  I also like the guy's expression in the front left but unfortunately the softness hurts."
streetphotography,3bxikf,wsteinh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"Good eye, yes the image is about the guy in the back right.  What drew me to the subject is that he appeared to be peaking on something. A little more room or even a little more motion might have separated him more from the crowd.  I had no intentions of trying to get the two guys in front in focus to me they are just foreground interest. The guy was standing frozen with that expression while the rest of the crowd was getting their rave on.  Also to add to the strangeness is that the house lights would come on for a brief moment and only then was it bright enough to shoot or even see the guy. It would be dark and then lights would come on and he would be standing there motionless.   It was a strange moment and not one that was easily translated.  One of times those it was a better shooting experience then actual photograph. Thanks everyone for the feedback."

streetphotography,3bq9tm,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:22:01 2015 UTC,"This guy has hit the nail on the head, although I'd like to add that when a professional says you can break the rules; there are rules to breaking the rules. The actual rules still apply, but you use them non traditionally. For example the use of leading lines in traditional wedding photography draws the eye to the bride and groom. However, if you take a picture from behind them, you may want to create a feeling of where they are going. Towards the church or their car perhaps, or along a bridge or into the sunset. Clearly amateurs are misinterpreting this en mass.  This is where you can switch you primary and secondary subjects around due to a different perspective and intent. So when someone (assuming they understand composition) says that you can break the rules, this is what they mean. In reality it's a case of using the rules in an advanced way. The same applies to music. I'd provide an analogy but my musical jargon is next to non-existent."

What takes it away is the interaction between subject and photographer (which there seems to be none), as well as technical aspects (ex: focus). I like what you tried to do with the flash (Is there even a flash?). Next time, get in there! Interact! This is the hardest part in street photography! But trust me, it's so worth it.

Might be something you'll be interested in, if you haven't seen already.  http://www.hinius.net  For me, the composition is too basic and I don't know what you really want me to look at. The path that you're on leads me to your 'props' when really, the lines imply that they are your subjects... And to me, they are too distant for me to have any sort of connect."

streetphotography,3bl2n0,wakozako123,2,Tue Jun 30 17:11:31 2015 UTC,"It varies to be honest. Depending on your audience your photo could be considered street photography. I consider lots of images to be 'street'. My favorite ones don't include any urban environments. The thing is for attempts like yours, you really need put more consideration into your composition. Any attempts that would be considered 'offensive' rely on chance, emotion, gesture and framing. You had all the time in the world to set up your composition and experiment with different positions simply because there was 'nothing' going on. Not trying to knock on your attempts, but it's just something to keep in consideration next time.  Also to add onto Hin Chua's photos. The reason I linked you his website was because he's one to use people as props while making the environment the focus. While his subject matter could be considered 'gritty' the composition he used makes it almost dream-like and beautiful. I am always incredibly moved by his photos and it's a good example to show and follow."

streetphotography,3bkgsc,piercesapper,2,Mon Jun 29 23:22:11 2015 UTC,I think its too dark.  I feel like several of your BW shots suffer from this.  The people in the images are potentially interesting but you can't see their faces.  The silhouette in the back is also potentially interesting but not enough to carry the image on its own.  I would have tried to maybe integrate that element in with what was going on around it but you can't really see anything else.  The tilt is unjustified IMO.
streetphotography,3bkgsc,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:17:42 2015 UTC,Ya I totally agree with you. I think the reason they are so dark is due to overdeveloping? (lol I don't know I didn't develop them). I remember properly exposing them (or maybe that's what I want to think haha). Ill take that into consideration. Thanks for that. I do agree that the tilt was not necessary. Thanks for the kind critique!
streetphotography,3bk3mu,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Mon Jun 29 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you were going for here. There are some strong shapes and lines going on, the guy on the right is mildly interesting and the two on the left add some nice interaction to the scene. But it just doesn't quite come together, feels a little jumbled. The diagonal lines near the two people on the left would be strong on their own, but the giant sign in the middle detracts from that -- to be frank, it's the main weak point of the image, as its front and center demanding attention but doesn't really contribute anything to the image other than the separation of the two ""scenes."" Personally I think the man on the right would have been the more interesting subject. Good ideas at work here but missed the mark on execution, in my opinion. Thanks for posting it."
streetphotography,3bk3mu,mj1176,2,Mon Jun 29 21:50:25 2015 UTC,"Yea so I like how the guys arm kinda mimics the shape of the sign and how the the whole RHS acts as an arrow to point the viewers eye to the LHS.  Unfortunately, I think you're right about how it feels disconnected because there isn't much of a connection between the two sides.  I got some shots of the guy on the right as the main focal point too though.  Think I just wanted to make the image more complex/interesting than it actually is.  Thanks for the feedback."
streetphotography,3bk3mu,VeinyPickle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:26:09 2015 UTC,"My first reaction was ""oh, wow!""  If that sign is still there, you need to revisit the location and hope for even more blue or orange colours to show up in this shot. I think there's a lot of potential."

The most interesting thing within the shot to me however is the extreme amount of focus towards the bottom right hand corner of the image. You've got the gazes of everyone in frame looking that way, as well as the intense light reflection. I'm glad to see some layering going on as well, as it's friggin' hard to do well and we see it so rarely in this sub.  Not usually a fan of protest shots, but this one is okay.

streetphotography,3bfu1h,MughalPrince22,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"By ""lens size"" do you mean focal length?  It depends on the camera format I use on the day.  When I use 35mm camera with mechanical shutter, my two to-go focal length are 28mm and 85mm. Some times 50mm but very seldom."
streetphotography,3bfu1h,PinholePhotographer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:34:44 2015 UTC,28 It's the only lens I've been using for quite a long time now.
streetphotography,3bfu1h,arteryal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:00:06 2015 UTC,"50mm, but I've been starting to use 24mm a bit more lately.   If you mean size as in physical size, they're both pretty pocketable, albeit uncomfortable in tight pants."

streetphotography,3bfu1h,CatsAreGods,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:16:10 2015 UTC,I use a Canon 24/70. It can be a drawback if your into shooting incognito.  It's a long noticeable lens especially with the shade on but you can learn to work around it.
streetphotography,3bfu1h,haggertyjmn,0,Tue Jun 30 01:27:00 2015 UTC,"I don't primarily because it provides for too many options. The less decisions you have to make the better, however that doesn't discredit them at all. Using what you're comfortable with is of utmost importance."

streetphotography,3bfu1h,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:52:51 2015 UTC,18-200mm because it's my only AF lens. I have a lot of manual primes but they are not good when I only have few seconds or less to get the shot. If I could chose a AF prime I would take maybe 35mm or 28mm prime with my cropsensor.
streetphotography,3bfu1h,AceLesk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:59 2015 UTC,"My Pana-Leica 15mm, which is 30mm full frame equivalent (I'm a micro 4/3 shooter).  Really is very freeing. I don't have to worry about as much about the composition, makes me think more about capturing the moment. Of course when I do think about framing, it's very natural to me. Not too wide like a 24mm, not awkward like a 35mm. I know 35mm gets a lot of love from street shooters but I'm honestly not a fan of 35mm lenses, I just can't see the world from that length."
streetphotography,3bfu1h,SleepingPodOne,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:34:41 2015 UTC,35 for a walk around gets just enough background for me. 50 is perfect for something in between environmental and portraiture.  28 feels too wide except for the most aggressive shots.

streetphotography,3bfu1h,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:32:28 2015 UTC,I do super candid stuff mostly     What does that mean?
streetphotography,3bfu1h,arteryal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:58:05 2015 UTC,"Not just candid in the sense that they were not expecting the photo, but in that I don't want them to be aware of me at all. It is still candid if they happen to look into your lens at the last moment or are aware of you before you decide to take a picture of them. Mainly it comes down to the fact that people behave differently if they are aware someone might be recording their actions. So I use a telephoto to stay back a bit and retain their natural public behavior when they think they are hidden in plain sight.  TL:DR I was assuming most people viewed the definition of candid on a spectrum dependent on context, like much of the English language."
streetphotography,3bfu1h,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:22:43 2015 UTC,"Right, but in terms of the image, it's either candid or it isn't. Are you saying you don't want them aware of the camera even after the image is made, or that you don't want to risk ruining an image by getting spotted?"
streetphotography,3bfu1h,arteryal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:28:43 2015 UTC,"I don't want to risk ruining the image by being spotted. I'm not saying you can't do this up close, it's just easier from a little further away. I sometimes go for wider angles too though, I just seem to have gelled to my telephoto as a personal taste."
streetphotography,3bfu1h,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:12:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, it seems as though people have this radar for cameras within the 2-5m range, anything outside or inside of that goes rarely noticed."

streetphotography,3bfntf,Boosted03gti,2,Sun Jun 28 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"I think you found an interesting subject, but I personally don't like or even understand why you chose to frame it the way you did?  The most notable thing is that shot this from WAY above them.  Rather than talk about why it didn't work for me, may I ask why you chose to shoot them from above?  Also, the people in the background are very distracting to the image.  If you are shooting this sort of unposed street portrait style, I think you generally want to frame your subjects with either a minimal background, or one that provides context or juxtaposition for your subjects.  People always talk about how you should shoot street photography with a large depth of field for a number of correct reasons, but to me this is a case where shooting wide open would have helped as well.  Hope this is useful."
streetphotography,3bfntf,wsteinh,2,Sun Jun 28 22:06:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the CC.   The high angle was exaggerated due to the couple walking up a ramp as I was coming down plus I am taller then most at 6'1"" and have been working on bending down a bit when shooting.   definitely need to be more aware of my backgrounds."
streetphotography,3bfntf,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:22:07 2015 UTC,I'd like to point out that you might've had the chance for a decent layering here if the background people weren't so cut off. A horizontal frame would've helped in this regard.

My firm belief is that it's not up to the moderators to start deleting these images, and I still stand by this view. I just wish people were more self-regulated when posting in a subreddit that's so specifically niche, just like you would for any other subreddit. I don't understand why this subreddit can be viewed as a place to dump any photograph taken."

Hell, they even hashtag street photography in some photos. While I wouldn't consider their stuff to be 100% street photography they are very nice urban landscapes. Then again, I've been trying to avoid associating my photographs with the term 'street photography'... At this point, it's confusing trying to pin-point what fits into the genre."
streetphotography,3bgd96,Hates_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:35:47 2015 UTC,The problem is self critiquing is a difficult skill. People are too afraid to throw away photos and get too wrapped up in the story they tell themselves about a photo. If the photo can't speak for itself then reject it and move on.
streetphotography,3bgd96,lidocaineus,2,Tue Jun 30 16:22:51 2015 UTC,Eric Kim has just released another free book which looks good: The Street Photography Composition Manual  http://erickimphotography.com/blog/2015/07/01/the-street-photography-composition-manual/
streetphotography,3bgd96,arteryal,2,Wed Jul 1 23:06:38 2015 UTC,"Here's something that's been kind of itching at the corners of my brain for awhile and I have insomnia so here goes: ""popular"" street photography. I guess an example would be in order.  I occasionally peruse 1x.com's street category. I do this because supposedly 1x is highly curated, and there are good street shots in there. But there are an equal number of questionable images that leave me to scratch my head. This brings up two things:   Some images I'll disagree with as poor, but I can chalk it up to differences in opinion with who's ever curating. But others are just so weak or have little to do with street that I wonder about the curators themselves because it happens so often for something supposedly well vetted. There's a whole portion of the site that involves other members voting on images to even just get to having the image considered for curation. This brings up the whole popularity contest idea, as well as the fact that there are plenty of people without eyes for anything voting in categories where they can't tell the difference between a spectacular image and an extremely poor one. Inevitably, these photos fall into the over-done, overly processed, 500px-style images.   Anyway this is the age old question of artistic merit vs easily accessible ""pop art"", and where they do and do not intersect. How do you have a conversation on photography with people who are into that type of photography (or really any creative field) when they critique you on things you're aiming for, but they miss the point? A quick example so as to remove the ""you just think you know better than the other person"" idea: I've pointed out the C-B ""Hyères, France"" image to explain certain concepts, and the person's response? ""I don't like it; the cyclist is blurred.""  With one person you can easily dismiss this as the person being photographically illiterate. However when it's a sea of people, what does this mean? Of course you should seek your own goals without worrying about what everyone thinks all the time (while learning from those you respect), but of course you have to think about what the popular side of the equation can add to your own work. Maybe nothing good and you'll end up selling your soul as you chase after popularity numbers, maybe you figure out a good compromise and you land in the intersection of artistically great and popular, maybe nothing at all.  Long story short: when you create work you're proud of and which peers you respect appreciate, but your good friend who doesn't know anything about photography / the well meaning but not very well-versed photographer neighbor can barely contain their boredom over the same image, it can be a bit of a bummer. Can the divide be bridged more often? Is it pointless?"

streetphotography,3bgd96,lidocaineus,2,Mon Jun 29 09:26:00 2015 UTC,"I suppose you're right. I've always used the term ""layer"" to define multiple points of depth within a shot. Not necessarily overlapping subjects."

streetphotography,3bg97w,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:17:23 2015 UTC,"In the most basic sense, it must be a study of human condition in the public space. It does not have to be Urban, but it should convey some sense of feeling, thought, question or communication about humanity, life, personality etc.   In some cases you can create something for this purpose, technically making it street photography, but if it is not a good image or subject; one that cannot convey what you intended to at least some viewers, then others will not see it as street photography.  It is a common mistake, one which I made when I first started posting on this sub and made a bit of an arse out of myself, to assume that it just has to be an image taken on the street. While there are those who take the definition too far to include their personal tastes, like the inclusion of a journalistic theme or that it must be taken using a certain method; it MUST somehow study human condition.  If you like pictures taken on city streets which don't necessarily match this, check out the definition of Urban photography, which includes all forms of street photography as as sub genres.

Part of that is because I just like the symmetry between themselves and the reflection, but also because the main guy is so much brighter than everything else in the frame that he feels edited in.   If you strobed him I'd say dial down the ratios a bit more between subject and ambient.  If it's because there's a shaft of light there maybe step back to make it clearer. Or go the opposite direction and go even more contrasty so you get a raking light and lots of shadow."

streetphotography,3b9jux,arteryal,8,Sat Jun 27 09:58:38 2015 UTC,I don't think you understood that /u/VeinyPickle was actually being sarcastic. If you're defending your photos because they belong in a street photography series the majority of the individual photos need to be strong and stand on their own. And your photos aren't strong.   They're incredibly weak as street photography. These photos will do fine with an Instagram audience (which evidently this subreddit is becoming filled with more and more of everyday) but they won't impress anyone that's experienced in street photography and dedicated the majority of their photography time on.  You keep posting tight telephoto literal photos of peoples legs/feet. So what? There's nothing to explore with my eyes in the frame. It's like a snapshot that isn't saying anything deeper no matter what excuse you're coming up with. The photos are devoid of any context of the street around it that basically disqualifies it from being street photography.  Also downvoting someone that is making completely valid points is uncalled for.
streetphotography,3b9jux,tremendousPanda,4,Sat Jun 27 13:31:05 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised you got downvoted as they hide behind their shitty images. I'm fucking sick of the shithouse pics being upvoted this much.

I am downvoting the unecessery agressivity and angryness shown for no reason at all, as if I had any thing to do about someone particula issues about their feelings towards street photographs.  I am used to critiques and I see critiques here are very weak. You read ""long lens"" hardly will make good street photograph, or poor in content, but no explanation about the statment at all. It is the same as don't saing nothing at all.  The photo being not good or make someone angry because it wasn't shot with a wide angle lens doesn't make sense at all, looks like trying to make their personal taste as a rule.

No explanation for why telephoto lenses have no place in street? There are millions of explanations online if you'd bother to do a little research. What the fuck do you want from us? This isn't a street photography workshop, this isn't a school, you haven't paid for anyone's attention.

Perhaps it's a silly distinction to make, but it seems a valid one to me. I know that many people do it, but it's not what I use mine for. It seems like a violation of the concept."
streetphotography,3b83uu,miked00d,2,Fri Jun 26 23:35:34 2015 UTC,It does indeed seem like a silly distinction.  It's the only medium he/she uses to show his/her photos though so I'm not sure the distinction is particularly valid in this case anyways.
streetphotography,3b83uu,FemaleAngst,2,Sat Jun 27 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it - I'm just drawing the distinction between using Instagram as a sort of Tumblr, and using it as it was initially intended to be used."

streetphotography,3b7zd6,Foxhovnd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:08:17 2015 UTC,I'm always reminded of the mods from HCSP saying that shooting homeless people is like shooting fish in a barrel when it comes to street photography.
streetphotography,3b7zd6,Hates_,3,Sat Jun 27 17:21:07 2015 UTC,And that's putting it nicely. At least when you shoot fish in a barrel you get to eat fish... When you shoot homeless people and other low hanging SP fruit you just get garbage images.

Also, in my opinion, I think a shift a little towards to the left and maybe a step back would've made for a better composition. That way, the corner of the wall is more defined, also cutting out a little bit of the wall on the right.   Nonetheless, I still like the photo. I think it's good, but just minor improvements with composition would've made it better."

streetphotography,3b5274,Hates_,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:20:05 2015 UTC,"Your timing is good on this photograph. It captures the essence of the scene. If a little more detail to composition wouldn't have altered the timing, it would have been a worthwhile effort. Perhaps with the camera moved horizontally to the left as so it's not tilted to the subject, making them appear less skewed. In addition, bringing the lens down some vertically to capture their heads closer to the top of the frame and square it up some. The background is a little distracting since it's your chess players that should have all the attention."
streetphotography,3b23yo,PinholePhotographer,5,Thu Jun 25 10:18:58 2015 UTC,I haven't commented on any photos in this subreddit in a long time but how the fuck is a long lens shallow depth of field shot of a mans legs getting upvotes? Did standards in this subreddit take a sharp drop?
streetphotography,3b23yo,DillonVFX,-2,Fri Jun 26 00:51:58 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a long lens but a 85mm prime lens on a crop sensor. And the DOF is not that shalow but only the second plan.  It is not because I took the photo, but I guess you are looking only the technical aspect. The image is much more rich than its technical aspect. Not only because the word Business, but because the word mach the look of the man reading the newspaper, and both mach the ""businessman"" walking futher in the scene.  The worm brown colours transmit some tradition on a certain public specially sucessiful business people, and its brigtness a positive aproach to the subject.  Also shows some visual dynamic with the walking man on the back and the reading idea. As something going on or life happening.  But you are right. The technical aspects is what most people are attracted to. The more commercial the image looks the more people associate to ""professional"" and there for ""good"". Specially the material tangibility appeal that most people look in photographs now a days, the more sharpness, colours and technical rules effect the more attention it gets."
streetphotography,3b23yo,DillonVFX,6,Fri Jun 26 09:41:37 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a long lens but a 85mm prime lens on a crop sensor. And the DOF is not that shalow but only the second plan.   So the full frame equivalent of a 135mm lens give or take depending on the camera brand. That IS a long lens and you can't deny that.   It is not because I took the photo, but I guess you are looking only the technical aspect. The image is much more rich than its technical aspect. Not only because the word Business, but because the word mach the look of the man reading the newspaper, and both mach the ""businessman"" walking futher in the scene.   No I'm not only looking at the technical aspect. I just mentioned the focal length and shallow depth of field because those two elements almost always disqualify a photo from being good street photography.   The subject matter is just so boring. The photo photo doesn't conjure any emotional reaction from me. Unlike this one that almost makes you feel stress because of the placement of the mans hand.    Also shows some visual dynamic with the walking man on the back and the reading idea. As something going on or life happening.   Then why did you take the photo with a shallow depth of field if we're supposed to make a connection with something in the background. Shallow DoF is used when a competent photographer's saying ""Hey don't look over there! Only look at what's sharp!"". Someone that's not as competent or is new to photography uses it because ""Look how pretty things look when the background is blurred!""   But you are right. The technical aspects is what most people are attracted to.   I care about content/subject matter way more than I do about what gear or settings was used for a photo. As an example this is one of my favourite non-street photos. It's by James Nachtwey and in that photo you can instantly see a connection between the collapsing building (9/11) and the Christian cross, I also felt an immediate emotional reaction to that even though I'm an atheist.   Your photo relies on the audience being able to read English and see the connection between elements of the frame even though you've deliberately blurred it to tell them ""don't look here!"".  Your photos also scream to me ""I'm too afraid to take photos of people faces so I use a long portrait lens to take tight photos of peoples feet while being as far away as possible from them!""."
streetphotography,3b23yo,lidocaineus,-2,Fri Jun 26 10:13:20 2015 UTC,A lot of judment here. Now we have rules for good street photography. I never thought about. You seems to be too sure about what you say that I won't say anything about. I hope you hate the photo the way you like.  ;)

A 35mm on a crop sensor is roughly 50mm (which is the start of telephoto), a 50mm on a crop sensor is 85mm (TELEPHOTO), and an 85mm on a crop sensor is a whopping 135mm (AKA long lens)."
streetphotography,3b23yo,GomezHamburger,-1,Fri Jun 26 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"I have never seen 135mm as tekephoto. Interisting. Anyway, why does it matter?"
streetphotography,3b23yo,targetOO,2,Fri Jun 26 23:32:46 2015 UTC,"The only time 135 is not telephoto is large format (even in medium format it's encroaching on telephoto territory). It matters because the angle of view of 135mm on a dslr is extremely small, rendering it extremely difficult (though not impossible) to get a good street photography shot."
streetphotography,3b21n3,FallingFear,2,Thu Jun 25 09:45:26 2015 UTC,"Really nice alignment, the placement of the subjects at the edge of the crossing depicts well the disconnection that sometimes we force to happen between each other.   Now technically, since you applied what looks like a underexposed film present you could have used a higher ISO and a smaller aperture, that would bring more sharpness to the subjects, the details on the woman are quite poor due to her low contrasting clothes, which we do not see happening with the man. Finally the image does not seem to have the standard dimensions, if so, I would have cropped more of it, the right side in this case, leaving the background just being the bush and not including the post and bit of the street which you left.   Overall you seem to have a good eye, there are just some technicalities with the shot, imho."
streetphotography,3b21n3,nuno_cruz,2,Thu Jun 25 10:51:21 2015 UTC,"I do like it, but I don't have much more to say about it. It is well shot but there isn't a whole lot of content here.

streetphotography,3b1l0a,Regcamphoto,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:54:42 2015 UTC,I actually like the writing... lends a little character to the image. I also think cutting of head space would have made the image oddly composed. Less head space would make sense if the image was shot from a lower angle.
streetphotography,3b1l0a,ugly_whiskey_smoker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:50:33 2015 UTC,I like it. I just wish he had more room below his feet. That would have also gotten rid of that writing on the wall to the right that's being cut off which is kind of distracting. A minor grievance.

streetphotography,3auncj,arteryal,5,Wed Jun 24 08:32:01 2015 UTC,"damn it, I wrote a huge thing and then my power went out, so the short version will have to do.    The guy in the bottom right of the frame holds the entire image together, he's the difference between junk and brilliance. Not just because someone is there, but because he changes the entire way that you experience the image.    Without him, the frame is really awkward, unbalanced and lacking in interest. Even though he's not all that interesting himself, his interest in the subject is what rounds out the whole thing. First we see her reflection in the mirror with the text and bright round mirror, her expression, gaze, gesture, etc, then we move to the right, to a large, bright but very dull and uninteresting area of the frame. We want more and there he is, well lit, in the perfect position, low, almost lost to the corner and he's looking back up to the reflection. We follow his gaze and the handrail back up to her and it's just perfect but without him, we'd be lost and the whole failure of the right hand side would just be.. a giant big disappointing mess."

(i.e. I wish I was opposite them instead of behind but they were moving quickly)   I like the light and shadow on their suits a whole lot. I think that makes the photo for me. Is just seeing how the light wraps around their suits and falls off to shadow.   I don't want to go beyond technical stuff because I really dislike trying to impart meaning or ""story"" in a photo. Even if I was trying to tell one (or not) I'd much rather the one viewing decided over me. Which is something I adore about film, and while I don't think the cinematic look aids in pushing a viewer to ascribe their own meaning, I just think it looks nice so it's ticking two boxes for me as a fan of film and aspiring photographer."

That's not entirely a terrible reason. That's a reason to go on and shoot it ""better."" Hit the street and keep working on improving the image until you think you've exhausted the possibilities of the image.  Check out Eric Kim's Suits project, too. I know you said you don't want to impart meaning into a photo, but look at what his project tells."
streetphotography,3aqhk9,Pieeetr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:37:26 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, the fact that it isn't quite the shot I want is all the more reason to try and get the one I want. Seeing as it was around lunchtime and they were coming out of a mall there's a chance they'll be there again. I might see the same sort of scene again as I shoot there frequently because it's one of the few busy places in my town.   I've seen Eric's suits series before and I know he's said it reflects how he felt as a ""suit"" earlier in his life.  I guess when I'm just posting single photos online I'd rather not impose my feelings (or ""meaning"") onto it but if I were to work on an actual series or project I'd definitely come at it with an angle. I have been thinking about working on a long term project but I'm still very much a novice and would prefer to have a better technical skill before I go working on a purely artistic endeavour."
streetphotography,3aqhk9,VeinyPickle,0,Tue Jun 23 10:11:05 2015 UTC,Try to get in front of the subject. Get uncomfortably close and in their faces. Now it feels like you are a little bit to shy to come close enough or even get a good angle. My two cents.
streetphotography,3aqfcx,leftlooserighttight,6,Mon Jun 22 17:48:07 2015 UTC,Street performers are low-hanging fruit. If you're gonna shoot them it'd better be damn good otherwise it tends to fall pretty flat as good SP.
streetphotography,3aqfcx,mj1176,0,Mon Jun 22 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"Good timing, but a slower shutter speed would give a sense of motion, which is important in photography. Also, next time try revealing the feet of those bending over so that nothing is cut off by the frame. A few step to the right may also be a better angle for creating a more 3D image."
streetphotography,3aos93,kleetimm,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:24:17 2015 UTC,It's two people walking without doing anything interesting without interesting expressions overlapping each other in an uninteresting way while lines go over and behind them in an uninteresting way  against an uninteresting background in uninteresting light.   The ashtray or planter at the end of the ramp is kind of interesting. That's about it.
streetphotography,3aos93,lidocaineus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:19:19 2015 UTC,"There are more things interesting than just that ashtray (which I don't find interesting at all).  Good light, those girls framed between that splash of light is interesting, framed between those two shades as well as the sign and ashtray, nice symmetry there along with their legs in sync mid stride. The overlap doesn't bother me much. I find the pole distracting. I also like how the sign mimics the legs. I would have rather you got more of that shape up top (is that a balcony, a sign, some blob of concrete attached to the building?) and cut some space at the bottom.  Graphically, it's nice minus that pole... But it's a photo I would just not remember."

I like the overall aesthetic - kinda like a rushed watercolour painting or something, but with a slight moment of clarity. The resonance between the light streaks and the girls arm (same direction and similar form) is the strongest element in the shot. I also like how the sign in the background is the exact opposite of the light streaks/girls arm.  I think perhaps if the girl filled the frame a little more, it might make it stronger.  Thanks for sharing!"
streetphotography,3akxs0,Nonchalant_Elephant,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:26:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks man.  I shot this on a 21mm.

streetphotography,3akw6a,backofthenett,3,Sun Jun 21 05:03:08 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad shot, but a couple things stand out:   If you had stopped down you could've gotten not only the boy in the front in focus, but the girl in the back as well, and provided a nice dual layered image (it would've been even better if she was looking at him). The expression on his face is good – it's very expressive and nuanced, not just a blatant smile or frown. I personally would've waited for him to engage with something in the frame to make it less documentary and more street. Though you've filled the frame with the subject, you've done it at the expense of context. This is particularly important here as knowing it's a graveyard setting would make for a far more interesting image. As it stands it's not quite clear where they are. It could be a cemetery but it's a bit ambiguous. Along those lines – did you crop this or just shoot it portrait-style? I'm not a stickler for  ""street photography should be shot horizontally"" just because it's a generalized rule, but because shooting vertically almost always kills context except in certain circumstances. Here you would've gotten way more context shooting horizontally (or not cropping this way).   By the way, I find this photo of yours to be far stronger for a number of reasons (the hint of the TV, the passageway with the dark figure in the background, the boy's position and eyes, the clean linens in the front contrasting with the rough background). Probably the only thing that bothers me is the DOF and the water bottle. You actually have a number of pretty good images in your stream, though for a bunch of them I'd say stop down way more."
streetphotography,3akw6a,lidocaineus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for spending the time to give me these comments, really appreciate the feedback. I find it a bit of rock and a hard place on the depth of field question, in terms of ensuring the key point (The boy) is  the area that attracts you attention, I consider that a larger dof would have been a distraction in terms of is the boy or the girl the subject? On the cropping, I have cropped the image however it was shot in portrait.  The tombs that are around them are fairly bland and generic and a slightly wider aspect doesn't add much to the image that this is a graveyard.  I will try out your ideas on increased DOF and really appreciate your comments.  Best Regards  Keith"
streetphotography,3akw6a,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:35:02 2015 UTC,On the other flickr image..... you are totally on the money regarding the water bottle!! Thanks
streetphotography,3akw6a,dumpsterjuicee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:39:20 2015 UTC,"The reason a lot of street photography has a large DOF is for two reasons: 1) shorter focal lengths simply have more DOF and 2) context is king in street, and to get that you need a lot of stuff in focus.   Working with a large DOF can be tricky for exactly what you mentioned; drawing your eye to the subject is harder when you don't have in focus/out of focus elements to direct your attention. When you can't rely on bokeh you have to rely on objects in the frame directing you to the subject. This can be leading lines, objects or people directing attention towards something, or subject isolation. In your photo if the girl in the background had been in focus and looking at the boy you would've naturally followed her gaze. Alternately, you could end up with something far more broadly layered.  Since you're not relying on bokeh and instead on frame composition (lines, objects) or waiting for a particular moment (a person's gaze), this is obviously far harder than just blurring everything out with a small DOF. But that's what makes it way more interesting."

streetphotography,3agide,VeinyPickle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:25:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment, I really like your advice!  Composition errors aside, is the content of the picture weak? Is the subject clear, or is it lost because of the distance?"
streetphotography,3agide,haggertyjmn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"If your subject was the juxtaposition between the trolley and two strollers, you're too far to fill the frame with them, and it's rather underexposed (the subjects).  Is the content weak? In its current frame, yes. If you got closer to only have those three, then maybe."

streetphotography,3aec5u,VeinyPickle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:57:09 2015 UTC,What do you like and don't like about it? Ignore the colour completely for a bit.
streetphotography,3aec5u,piercesapper,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely like the smoke (steam?) rising from the pot, and the bluriness of the server mixing with it. I also like how his face is obscurred by his hand serving a glass  I'm less certain about the other items or whether the composition could be changed to better serve the subject (e.g. made tighter on the wine pot, skipping the right side of the counter) ."
streetphotography,3aepvn,lurkinshirkin,4,Fri Jun 19 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"Some quick thoughts on all the ones you showed:  -Generally some very nice composition, great eye for the odd/dramatic  -Fish and Chips and the Waltzer are hurt by being shot vertically, both are heavy, longer compositions and would be more dramatic horozontally, the negative space doesn't add much.  This allow will allow the faces of the people in the images to be highlighted.  A square crop might also be nice on both.  -I love the idea of Waltzer (very similar to a picture I shot once), but I would have waited around for the woman to make a better expression, or turn her face a bit more.  Also, getting a bit closer might have helped you see more of her personality.  Imagine the image if she had been making a similar face to the woman in the poster, or the opposite face.  Instead she is essentially not emoting at all.  I think that definitely undercuts the strong reaction I had to the picture. -The colors are nice in Palace of Fun, but I think its the weakest of the images.  Not sure what I'm supposed to be reacting to.  -Might want to try converting some of these to black and white.  Could help with some of the messier color backgrounds (especially the Fall picture)  -Keep shooting  Hope this helps."

There's not much point critiquing individual images however, I think it would be highly beneficial for you to embrace the constraints of the frame. Choose a single aspect ratio and work with it. It seems you have the 'fix it later' bug and that's not to say that everything must be done in camera, but if you're in the mindset of a certain aspect ratio, your compositions will become much stronger in time, with practice."

streetphotography,3a9b7x,WeHave200Couches,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:24:23 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty obvious to the viewer what's going on here. It's not like without the title I wouldn't be able to read any deeper than 'oh look, people using phones on a train', so in that sense it doesn't add anything. Always be brutal and cull absolutely anything that's not necessary and have faith in your audience that they will work out what you're trying to do. Allowing them to come to the point by themselves gives them that much more satisfaction and appreciation of the piece. I think you have exposed the scene brilliantly, the colours and textures really draw me in, there's a tad too much dead space on the right which adds little. Great work man! Will you develop this idea?"
streetphotography,3a9b7x,piercesapper,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:39:51 2015 UTC,"If it points out what the photographer was capturing, then forego it and allow the viewer to pick it up on themselves. If the photographer needs a title to push what he was trying to show in the image to an audience, then he's failed to capture the scene and decided to try and repair it in post.  I'm not saying that's the case in OP's image, because it was quite obvious what he was capturing. I'm talking about non-descriptive titles in general, because as I quote myself; ""too many times the title is stronger than the image."" It's to the point that people grasp onto anything they can to make the image stronger or have more layers in it."

But, the way I do it (and many street photographers do it) is put where you made the picture (ex: Oklahoma) and then put the year you made it (ex: 2015). So the final title would be this: Oklahoma, 2015. I know this is a pretty boring way to do things, but it will give you time to think of a title for the image."

streetphotography,3abwb6,alapan415,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:40:17 2015 UTC,"Always over expose a little on black and white film. This will bring more detail into shadows and also lesson grain. Not sure about color though. Someone can maybe fill that in. I use tri-x 400 for my black and white. I also recommend illford hp5. It has a little more contrast and is a tad cheaper, I believe. For color, the cheap Fuji superia will do. It has a little grain but still looks pretty good. If you want to spend a little more, get Kodak portra 400. This provides nice neutral colors, good for skin tone. I also like Kodak ektar. This is a lot more saturated and colorful (it will make people with a lighter skin color look red). It's like the Fuji Velvia of color negative film. But if you're a color photographer, that's a good film to use. Happy shooting👍👍📷"
streetphotography,3a8xpy,hamletspigs,5,Thu Jun 18 04:07:01 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting image and I find it compelling, but is this street photography? I'm going to say no. You don't need people per se to make it SP (see a ton of Atget's stuff, and yes, I consider him a street photographer), but you do need a sense of humanity within the frame. This image seems to be the opposite and about the lack of humanity, along the lines of an urban decay shot with themes of decay (obv), nature, and abandonment."

streetphotography,3a80h3,ugly_whiskey_smoker,2,Thu Jun 18 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"thanks for the comparison, the ""only"" difference is that parke knew exactly what he was doing and planned it carefully, while my shot was created purely by mistake :) however, i do find these types of shots interesting, so i will try to do it again with better subjects and composition.  it's pretty easy to execute this actually, all you need is afternoon sun, and a patch of light on a shaded street."
streetphotography,3a80h3,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Thu Jun 18 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's a cool shot and IMO much more interesting then the images you previously submitted. It would probably get more attention if Trent Parke hadn't set the bar so high with his use of this technique.  From what we know about how Trent Parke works, it's probably safe to assume that he didn't get the shot that ugly_whiskey_smoker mentions in one shot.  I'm guessing he worked on getting that exactly the way he wanted it for quite awhile and because your subjects are stationary, there's even more of a reason for you to do the same.  If you like the shot, I'd suggest returning when the conditions are similar and playing with the idea more.  I think there's a lot of potential with this setting to hint at more of a story or emotional response rooted in the juxtaposition of the over exposed subjects and the rest of the people in the restaurant.  I do kind of like how the man to their left is covering his eye which kind of makes it feel like the subjects are blinding him ."

streetphotography,3a13wi,Lucretian,-1,Tue Jun 16 18:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hate titles. I see others just put ""Untitled"", so I'll do that in the future. Also, as said in another comment, I came to the same conclusion that eye level didn't do the scene justice and took another shot."
streetphotography,3a13wi,Rirere,2,Tue Jun 16 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with a previous comment-- the right hand side seems weirdly empty to me, and while I like the subject matter I don't think eye-level was appropriate for this (the problem being that eye-level, tilt-down angle has skewed this photo a bit, and it's a very common angle that doesn't do much for your subject).  This is actually a bit tough, because my thoughts would have been to move to camera left and crouch down to get a little closer to the front row of people (who are the main subjects).  Filling the frame with them a bit would've helped establish a strong foreground, and the people sitting around the statue would then by nicely positioned a bit upwards as a midground."
streetphotography,3a13wi,arteryal,2,Tue Jun 16 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"Composition is off for me, it's a bit loose on your RHS. Not bad for one of those 'looking at phone' pictures but I feel that your middle ground is lacking."

streetphotography,3a13wi,arteryal,3,Tue Jun 16 14:42:45 2015 UTC,"RHS = Right hand side  I would have atleast shifted to the left, making your top man centre with your crowd at the bottom.  To eliminate some of that extra green in the middle I would have crouched, and if you wanted, you can do a little joke with the crowd and have the man's feet rest on their shoulders.  Another way I would have done it was shift left and point your camera higher and tilt it a bit down to eliminate that curb going through your crowds heads and having it go over them (this, to me, will solidify a foreground separate from the bushes) and keep your top man in the back ground."

streetphotography,3a0wdu,VeinyPickle,6,Tue Jun 16 10:34:38 2015 UTC,"He is the reason I do street photography. It was seeing his photos from Dream/Life and Minutes to Midnight that opened my eyes to the world of street photography and also made me realise how much light changes a photo. It's quite clear to anyone that knows me how much he influences me (perhaps too much). Some may even call me sick for my obsession of collecting his photobooks and even going so far to collect his earliest photobooks like Dream/Life.  I definitely think he's one of the best street/fine art photographers out there because:   He's the only Australian full member of Magnum Photos He has an amazing ability to take photos that no one has seen or thought of before like ""The Camera is God"" excerpts from ""The Black Rose"". His passion and dedication to photography like going out nearly every single day to hit the streets for hours to take photos. I was talking with a photographer a few months ago who knew Trent Parke before he joined Magnum Photos and he told me that you'd see Trent Parke out on the streets of Sydney every afternoon."
streetphotography,3a0wdu,DillonVFX,3,Tue Jun 16 11:27:41 2015 UTC,I really like high contrast photography and the way he's used the light as well as motion in some of the work there is really cool. If someone posted those/similar images on here I feel like they would get shit on though by the critiques.
streetphotography,3a0wdu,Oronare,3,Tue Jun 16 23:27:58 2015 UTC,"Right. Because when we often see the people here post with expertly rendered light trails which work with the objects in frame, ghosted subjects that are compositionally as strong as a ""real"" person, and perfect executions of blowing out a subject into highlights yet keeping everything else under control, we pile on top of them at how they didn't get everything in focus."
streetphotography,3a0wdu,lidocaineus,2,Wed Jun 17 04:46:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I actually think if his photos were posted here they would be downvoted by the majority because they're not ""pretty"" and upvoted & discussed by the few ""harsher"" critics in this subreddit with comments that are more than just ""great capture"".   When I look at ""Dream/Life"" I do see weaker photos compared to his more recent stuff but I can always see that a lot of thought and consideration has taken place before he publishes/exhibits them such as having these two photos sequenced to be right next to each other in book form that while both are decent photos they become great photos when shown together: Photo 1 and Photo 2.   I can't say the case is the same with a lot of photos that get torn apart here as they're the type of photos that look like they were taken while the person was out on their Sunday stroll. There's no thought of how the elements in their frames relate to each other unlike this shot or attempt to capture expressions on peoples faces that combined with the exposure give an emotional reaction like a feeling of impending doom."

A little motion blur because of my slower shutter speed since I only had 50-speed film loaded.
streetphotography,39w7by,X100TConvert,2,Mon Jun 15 08:26:14 2015 UTC,Those nerves really are the biggest issue in street stuff (for me at least.)

The motion blur honestly isn't terrible, although it obviously would appeal to more if it wasn't that little bit blurred. I love the shot though, and props to you for getting so near!

streetphotography,39vtws,opalcard,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:25:06 2015 UTC,"Really like the moment you captured here but can't help but think it would be much stronger if the image was sharper.  I like the comparison of the girl riding in the basket up front with the girl running/crying in the back but the fact that they are both slightly out of focus/blurry is distracting.  Otherwise, I think you did a great job finding an interesting moment and framing it well in the camera."

streetphotography,39uvdx,ugly_whiskey_smoker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:04:07 2015 UTC,I was going through the Magnum site looking for inspiration when I came across the work of Martin Parr.  Is there something about him I don't get? His work all looks like amateur snapshots to me.
streetphotography,39uvdx,VeinyPickle,2,Wed Jun 17 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"Look at his series of works, not his singles. Just like Alex Webb's singles on the Magnum website, those single images aren't meant to be in a series, thus aren't curated as heavy as they would to put into a book. The Magnum site is pretty poor in navigating, but look up his works like ""The Last Resort"" and look at the Book images.  He's technically sound in composition etc. and I'm a fan of his content. His series of works reflect on the oddity of the middle and upper class. You see this a lot in his Luxury and The Last Resort series.  Check out this thread that has good discussion of his work.  Also, watch this really neat documentary on him. There are some really good parts such as when he's shooting at the races. He explains a lot about what he's after in his shots, and his images really reflect this."

streetphotography,39ux9d,khulk,5,Mon Jun 15 00:19:34 2015 UTC,"You know I like a lot of things about this photo, but for some reason I wasn't feeling satisfied about it. It took me awhile to figure out why. But things I like:   The guy with the backwards baseball cap is not only looking at the foreground guy, but he's carrying a dslr (and I like the meta-ness of it). The hand with the flyer in the bottom left corner is a little distracting, but I ultimately like how it leads you back into the frame. I wish there was a tiny bit more of it to act as a leading line / pointer. The foreground man's odd half-step position is visceral enough that I kept trying to figure out how exactly he's standing, or walking, or whatever.   So to me baseball cap guy is looking at something that the foreground guy is holding behind his back. And I'd like to say that's a really cool idea, but for some reason I don't find it very satisfying. Maybe it's because the foreground guy doesn't look like he's holding anything worth gaping at – it feels weirdly inconsequential. I wonder if we could see what he was holding and the other guy was still staring at it would I have the same reaction.  Anyway, there's a lot going right with this photo, it just didn't quite make it all the way for me. Also I'm glad someone posted a photo that made me have to think through it for a bit to get my thoughts in order."
streetphotography,39ux9d,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:24:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, and sorry for my late reply. I've been reading some technique/philosophy books and am realizing that I haven't paid much attention to leading lines and sense of space/depth. This photo is head-on and all the lines are horizontal, which seems to flatten the scene and make it unengaging. I was also using a 50mm from too far away. The mantra of this sub is ""wide angle and get closer!"". Seems about right."
streetphotography,39rxac,X100TConvert,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:08:34 2015 UTC,"It's a cool shot and very nicely post processed.   I kinda feel like the subject doesn't add anything to the photo though. Her top has the same pattern as the wall so she just blends in, and she's not very interesting to look at, she's just sitting there.   I love the framing though, the wall is very interesting and I think you've nailed the negative space ratio. Everything is in the frame that needs to be and its a really fascinating photo.  Edit: maybe I was a bit harsh on the subject, but perhaps you could have waited until she picked up a pan to wash or something."
streetphotography,39rxac,tclayson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:54:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I'm fairly happy with it.  At the moment my plan is to visit this market two or three more times and put together 20 images for a book (just for myself to have.) So I've been looking at this as perhaps the cover, since the negative space will allow for the title etc.   The problem with waiting too long here in Vietnam is generally when people spot you (as this lady did a split second after I got this) they pose and laugh and smile etc. But the people at the market are starting to recognise me now so a few more visits and they should hopefully start to ignore me."
streetphotography,39rxac,tclayson,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:00:19 2015 UTC,Good idea on the book cover!   I wish I had your patience. Can't wait to see more pictures from your trips to the market.

streetphotography,39pk41,Oronare,3,Sat Jun 13 14:37:37 2015 UTC,"I like a lot of the elements and I think you did a very good job of layering the scene, but to me it seems like a ""near miss"" for two reasons.  First is a simple one, namely that it seems like the focus is on the man looking in the back, when it seems like your main subject is the woman and the dog.  Second is harder to articulate but all of the expressions seem like they are just a hair ""off"".  Not quite as interesting or emotive as they might have been a half second before or after.  If you don't know what I mean, I can try to explain it better.  Keep shooting scenes like this, I think there is a lot of potential."

streetphotography,39nvck,shpow,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"I like it. I like the action of the waiter in mid step.  Some things to think about though would be, could you wait for another opportunity, one that doesn't involve the man in the middle? He takes away from it for me. If he was gone and it was just the waiter and the people sitting in the back it would work better I feel.  Also why f/2 @ 1/125? Why not bump your ISO up to 400 or 800 and get everything sharp at f/8 or maybe f/5.6? The waiter's shirt is sharp but his face isn't."
streetphotography,39nvck,X100TConvert,2,Sat Jun 13 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"Didn't need the extra details in the shop, or the guy's face. It had less to do with him and more to do with a waiter entering a shop.  As far as waiting goes, this was a quick coffee with a friend, I saw him going in once and he was tall and had a good step, so next time I saw him I snapped the pic. Yes, I tried to anticipate but at the end of the day it was still a snap and I wasn't hunting for a photo per se, so I just finished the coffee and left shortly after, didn't even stay checking what pictures I was taking until I got home. But I do see what you mean, yes, not the most ideal situation :)"
streetphotography,39nvck,X100TConvert,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"Also, I guess you could say keeping the photo a bit more 'mysterious' and not giving this man's face, keeping it in shadow, and emphasising what he carried (which is where I tried to focus, as I recall, is keeping the job and point of interest in focus. Less a portrait, you know? People don't look at a waiter's eyes when they walk, they look at the stuff. Or, well, at least I do."
streetphotography,39nnys,X100TConvert,2,Sat Jun 13 01:25:00 2015 UTC,Square crop makes it a bit tight for your layers to stand out.  Alex Webb and Koudelka are some of the masters doing this type of composition.

Sure, there is a human being in the foreground, and more humans clearly visible in the background. These are layers. Unfortunately, we're looking at a guy walking and the back of some heads.

I've been shooting a long time (with a break of two or so years in there) and his passion and ideas definitely helped light that fire back inside me. Took me a little while to warm to him but now I think he's great.   The other person who helped get me excited about photography again was Jared Polin. Again not a fan of his stuff (at all) and I've basically stopped watching any of his videos anymore but he did remind me that photography is just fucking fun through his enthusiasm for it.   I'm taking the Eric advice and sticking to my X100T and spending my money on books and getting my own work printed etc instead of gear I really don't need. I had a nasty case of GAS for a while.

I have no desire to be the best in the world, but I'm always looking for ways to take my hobby to the next level.   When I post a photo I'm not posting it to get praise, I'm looking for a critique.   To me a critique includes:   things I've done right that I should stick at (I'm no expert, but I hope my photos aren't 100% rubbish, there must be stuff I'm doing well)  things I've done wrong and why they are wrong  examples and explanation of ways to do better in the future    E.g. ""your photo is out of focus"" should be ""your subject being out of focus distracts from the picture. You can fix this in the future by shooting with a higher aperture which will give a wider dof""   In one you're just critisising, in the other you are guiding. You're explaining not just what's wrong, but what effect that has and you've given an example of how to fix in the future.   Let's just try and be teachers rather than critics."

A faster shutter speed would have given you a sharper image too, something I myself have to work on, I'm quick to draw but sometimes forget to bump up my SS when things are happening quickly.

streetphotography,39kcbv,X100TConvert,4,Fri Jun 12 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"It's a shame the state that this subreddit has headed...  The past few weeks, any honest or negative critique is backhanded by responses such as ""well I looked at your work, how dare you"" or ""well show us yours, then."" That's the wrong approach.  For one, you don't see film critics get asked to show what movies they've made to show that they have credibility.  Second, many of the more serious street photographers work towards series and thus don't show singles or a lot of work, as they rather hold those images until they have a series readily presentable.  In this case, and from what I know of arteryal, he seems like the person who works towards series, an important part of the street photography genre.  I personally have stopped providing honest critique because of the same response I get every time (I've looked through your profile and see that you shoot bad images, HOW DARE YOU JUDGE MINE!). The only time I've uploaded images are when they're throwaways that I don't see fitting in any series that I'm working on or will be in the future. What are the implications? When someone looks through my profile or asks for my work, what they see are my bad shots that I've thrown away for the sake of discussion on this subreddit. I post my bad ones hoping people learn to critique and give a good eye on what makes an image hold its weight. Are my throwaways thus an accurate representation on how I will view someone else's work?  In regards to arteryal's critique of this image, I'm in agreement. MANY street buskers pose for shots because it's solely marketing. Hell, I see many buskers encourage pictures being taken, and ask for people to post on Instagram etc. What do you say about this image that takes it away from just an image of a busker? Does it capture anything that's particularly quirky or unique?"

It's a shame the state that this subreddit has headed...   I agree, I find that this sub is becoming quite elitist. There's very little constructive criticism, e.g. ""the subjects in the frame don't really add any value"" - I don't understand this comment, why don't they add value? How could the shot be different to make it better? None of this is explained. If, like me, you're not an expert at this then it can be quite difficult to know what's wrong with a photo... and if you don't tell me (and just say my photo is rubbish) then I'll never know.  I don't know the ability level/experience of the OP but I assume that (s)he's just a guy/gal who enjoys doing a bit of street photography. We all want to get better at what we're doing, but its no competition. No need to be nasty to other people. I'm sure it'd be a much nicer place if everyone was to help out. Give the OP ways to take a better picture next time.  And maybe it'd be useful to point out the stuff the OP did right?! Its not a downright awful picture. What's wrong with saying something like ""Hey, you did X,Y,Z well, keep at that, just remember next time not to do A,B,C.""?"
streetphotography,39kcbv,tclayson,3,Fri Jun 12 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"There's very little constructive criticism   There used to be. But after the same tiring responses of people taking it so personal and going through profiles to have a tantrum, the more serious photographers have stopped. What we have left are either inexperienced newcomers who have their opinions and critique OF VALUE, and those who say ""great shot!"" with nothing else.   arteryal's comment is not helpful. Just telling someone their photo is rubbish isn't much help.   Ok, let's analyse his critique.   Buskers are the low hanging fruit of SP and if you're going to pursue it anyway, it needs to be remarkable.   It really is. Buskers and homeless people are easy targets for newcomers because they pose for you or don't have the choice to not pose for you. arteryal says, it needs to be remarkable. This point is important because after seeing image after image of buskers and homeless, only a select few STAND OUT. This point alone should be the focus of a street photographer when taking images of buskers or homeless people, for it to stand out from the rest of the large amount of buskers and homeless on Flickr.   In this case, it isn't. He's posing for a start, your background is very messy and the other subjects in the frame don't really add any value.   Right there, arteryal presented critique on why it wasn't a strong image. The background IS messy and is distracting to the subject. This detracts me as a viewer from looking at the subject, and rather my eyes wonder all over the frame in a bad way.  The other subjects in the frame truly don't add anything of value. Let's have a quick comparison of this image. How do you think the background and other subjects in the frame add to the image? What I see is a satisfying layering of the subject and the background because of how their faces are covered by shadow, which synthesis with the subject covering her face into the shadow. This synthesis makes the image stronger, because there's a direct relationship of the other subjects/background and the main subject.  Now would you say this is someone telling them their photo is rubbish, and isn't going to help? If I got a critique like that, I'd LEARN from it and remember those key points. I'd have another go at a shot like that with those points in mind. Subject, background, composition."
streetphotography,39kcbv,VeinyPickle,5,Fri Jun 12 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"You're actually really good at this, and I've seen you further down in the comments doing the same thing as well. You actually explain, give examples and (most importantly) teach. This is useful stuff to me, and actually I really like the example you linked to, I'll be looking out for shots like that in the future.  It took you all of 8 minutes to read my response, think about your answer, find examples and carefully explain yourself. It wasn't much effort for you, but its infinitely better than just saying ""this is rubbish"".   This is exactly what us amateurs need to get better and better."
streetphotography,39kcbv,tclayson,3,Fri Jun 12 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"It wasn't much effort for you     ..but it is mate. 8 minutes per response, per image, every day. People charge good money for workshops and portfolio reviews, here it's free, provided there's some engagement and the ego gets checked at the door."
streetphotography,39kcbv,arteryal,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to post to every single image, every single day. And forget the 8 minutes bit, I just want to see a bit more thoughtfulness in responses here. When you're just in it for a bit of fun, like me, its really disheartening to get disparaging comments where it sounds like the commenter has taken 30 seconds out of their busy day, just to tell OP that they photographed the easiest thing in the world and its really boring.  I'm not saying your comments were wrong, not in the least. And yes, people should be able to take negative criticism. If they post here they should know that's what they are signing up for. All I'm saying is that a negative point should end on a positive learning experience for the OP."
streetphotography,39kcbv,tclayson,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:46:46 2015 UTC,"its really disheartening to get disparaging comments     Fair enough, I get it.    If you post an image with a description of what you were thinking, doing, trying to achieve in the frame, want to achieve in similar situations, etc, etc, then you'll probably find the responses to be much more thoughtful."
streetphotography,39kcbv,arteryal,2,Sat Jun 13 07:53:50 2015 UTC,"Sounds reasonable to me. :) Also I think people should critique their own photos and ask obvious questions that they want to get answers for, which will help. Stuff like ""I feel there's too much negative space, how could I have framed this photo better?"" or whatever.  I will try and do this on my own photos in the future."
streetphotography,39kcbv,tclayson,3,Sat Jun 13 08:07:34 2015 UTC,"In addition to what VeinyPickle said, some people are faster writers than others and some people have more time.  I actually planned on writing a critique for every photo on the front page the other day, but got through about two because it really takes a long time to be thoughtful.  Here I think arteryal wanted to offer what I think is correct, important, and useful criticism, but didnt want to spend 15 minutes doing it.  I don't know how else he could have gotten the points across faster.  I also don't think it was that ""mean"".  He didn't insult him personally and wasn't even harsh with his criticism.  Do you disagree with anything he said?"
streetphotography,39kcbv,wsteinh,2,Fri Jun 12 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"arteryal's comment is not helpful.   i disagree.  he or she provided three very clear points of criticism: the subject is posing artificially, the background is messy, and the other subjects in the frame are haphazard.   How could the shot be different to make it better?   in my opinion, there's a limit to how much specific instruction (do x or y) one can or should give people along with a critique.  an important part of growing as an artist (even as a hobbyist) is to reflect on the critique and decide for yourself how to address the points it makes.  i think there's plenty in the critique above for OP to make adjustments next time."
streetphotography,39kcbv,Lucretian,2,Fri Jun 12 18:39:22 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this comment, why don't they add value? How could the shot be different to make it better? None of this is explained     See here. Perfectly valid questions and I would have been more than happy to have that discussion had OP taken that route, but instead I get ""WELL SHOW ME YOUR WORK THEN!"", no.    I didn't come here to argue that I'm right and you're wrong and here's my work it's better than yours so fuck you! That's NOT what this place is or should be about."
streetphotography,39kcbv,arteryal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely completely agree. You could have never taken a photo in your life and you could still comment. Lots of people can appreciate fine art, but can't draw to save their lives."
streetphotography,39kcbv,tclayson,2,Sat Jun 13 08:02:03 2015 UTC,"arteryal's comment is not helpful. Just telling someone their photo is rubbish isn't much help.   No, actually it was a normal critique. He didn't actually say ""This photo is rubbish,"" and walk away. It may have been too sparse for your liking, but guess what? That's when you ask him to explain why he said x or why you don't understand y.    Now if you're one of those people who doesn't actually want a critique and you're just posting a photo for the hell of it, you're not going to answer because you don't care and arteryal wisely saved the effort. If you do care about improving through criticism, you'd show some interest by asking those questions, at which point he'd have confirmed you are actually serious, and expound upon it.  I really wish there was some sort of criticism theory class people would be required to take before actually soliciting critiques because it's gotten to a point where people really don't understand how it functions with regard to their own work."
streetphotography,39kcbv,lidocaineus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"In this case, and from what I know of arteryal, he seems like the person who works towards series, an important part of the street photography genre.   You don't know this at all since he has never posted his own work.  And if he doesn't want to that's fine, just seems a little odd."
streetphotography,39kcbv,X100TConvert,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:28:20 2015 UTC,"No, I do know this because I've seen both his series and his singles. I've also seen a reaction from what I consider good photographers and their responses to his series were positive.  From what I've seen, his images are well composed, well spotted, and good content. But more importantly, I've never seen bad shots by him because he doesn't present his work online like we do."
streetphotography,39kcbv,VeinyPickle,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:04:34 2015 UTC,That's fair enough then.
streetphotography,39kcbv,X100TConvert,2,Sat Jun 13 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"This is really the first critique I've offered in quite some time and the only reason I posted it is because the other one doesn't do OP any favours. If people want their dicks tugged, they're not getting it from me and especially not after the influx of people from that thread who've come to see what the fuss is about.     I can't seem to find if you've posted any of your own work?     Correct, I don't post my work publicly."
streetphotography,39kcbv,arteryal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:14:47 2015 UTC,"Correct, I don't post my work publicly.   Do you have any work of your own?"
streetphotography,39kcbv,X100TConvert,3,Fri Jun 12 16:06:28 2015 UTC,"providing examples of one's own work - or even participating in the creation of art in the same media - is not a requirement to provide critique.  the three elements of the original critique by /u/arteryal (the subject is posing artificially, the background is messy, and the other subjects in the frame are haphazard) all stand on their own."
streetphotography,39kcbv,Lucretian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course, plenty."
streetphotography,39kcbv,arteryal,-1,Sat Jun 13 00:12:01 2015 UTC,I thought the exact same thing. I found this sub from a negative post over on /r/photography about how everyone over here is full of opinions with very little substance behind them.
streetphotography,39kcbv,VeinyPickle,2,Fri Jun 12 15:08:25 2015 UTC,"Take it from my perspective. The list that the OP posted in that thread were all points that any photographer who's taking photography even remotely seriously should consider. The OP posted the points in such a demeaning and sarcastic manner as to say this subreddit is preaching the wrong things.   Get close to your subject   Well, yes. You want to fill the frame with relevant information. This is basic composition.   Don't be afraid to get close to your subject   Are we meant to be afraid of our subjects?   Get close enough so that you can get good details of their eye pupils and nostrils   Shit stirring. No one on this subreddit has ever said anything like this, for obvious reasons.   If you bump into them while you are photographing, you should be close enough   More shit stirring.   Do not take photos of people's backs   Simply put, shots of people's backs neglects much of the characteristics of the person. Can you see their face or emotion? How would I know how the person is feeling? This isn't to say that a shot of someone's back isn't EVER interesting in the history of photography. This point is made so frequently on this subreddit because a shot of someone's back is so easy and 99% of the time is literally a shot of someone's back, there's no other detail or interesting content to hold the image's weight.   Do not take photos of homeless people (which I partially agree with)   I won't go into it because I'm so sick of arguing about this point, but Eric Kim puts it pretty well in his second point of the article.   You must tell a story with your street photography   This is something I only ever see where inexperienced or new people on this subreddit provide critique. The more ""senior"" members or members who ""study"" street photography often ignore this critique or don't offer it. In my opinion, a photo series/book is used to tell a story. Single images within only help with the narrative. A single image isn't expected to tell a whole narrative, because it's only one SINGLE image. Trent Parke shares the same thought, and Eric Kim summarises this well in point 7.   You must evoke emotions with your photos   Yeah... in the context of street photography. This genre has a history of being so close to photojournalism. A part of it involves documenting the human condition as it is. Of course you want to reflect the emotions of the time period that the images were shot. Does this point apply to other genres? No. But the OP obviously didn't have a street photography background to appreciate why this point is important IN THIS GENRE.   Your photos must connect with the viewer,otherwise, you failed   No shit. Can you imagine writing an article about why poverty is bad, and viewers comment ""I agree, the government should focus their money on defence and foreign policy""?   Do not take photos of people passing by walls/street lamps/bus stops, etc.   Because images like these are most often incredibly boring. The walls, street lamps, or bus stop backgrounds have nothing of value to the image. Does this mean it should be always avoided? NO. Juxtapositions can be created through ads on bus stops etc. Take a look at this Trent Parke shot of a bus stop. Look how he's framed and composed the shot so well, IMPLEMENTING the bus stop ad and environment. Now imagine he shot the kid sitting down with the background being another bus stop glass with seats. Is it as good?   Do not use a telephoto lens   Because you want to capture the environment that the subject is placed in. This is basic composition (foreground, subject, background). There have been famous street photographers that shot with 85mm, but they did it well. Take note of William Klein's famous shot (he uses ""telephoto"" lenses). This works well because he compresses the image via the telephoto to create a stunning image. Would you apply this compression to an image of someone walking against a wall?   Do not create bokeh when doing street photography   Back to the point of photojournalism and capturing the environment. By shooting at an aperture of 1.8 all the time, you're neglecting the environment and context that can carry an image. What you get is a visually beautiful affect that doesn't synthesise with the image.    Do not take photos of people holding an umbrella Do not take photos of people holding hands Do not take photos of reflections    That was never implied on this subreddit ever, more shit stirring. What happens though, is people take images of the EXACT SAME COMPOSITION and present it over and over again to the point that us, as viewers, get so sick of seeing the same thing. If you can do it well, then good for you, it's something we all (including me) strive for; to do something well. I'll keep taking images of umbrellas, holding hands, reflections, but I'll try and capture them in ways that aren't the same Flickr/500px composition.   Only take photos which are hard to replicate   Same point as above, what we see are the same tiring composition, over and over again. As viewers, we want to see something new. Could you imagine going to someone's art exhibition and seeing that every single image is an exact copy of Trent Parke's Minutes to Midnight? I would think, what the fuck, where's the artist's own merit? In the age of digital photography and sharing, we're going to see a lot more of the same images/basic composition. We're not saying to not take them, we're saying to choose what to present. You're your best critic.   Whoever is leaving a comment on a photo, has THE BEST definition of what street photography is   Arguments of the definition of this genre come up all the time. There's no set-in-stone response. In general though, the common response is ""capturing the human condition."" It's basic, and for the most part, it's a good representation of the genre.   Before pressing a shutter button, ask yourself if your photo will be good enough to be displayed in the most prestigious galleries in the world. If your answer is YES, then go ahead press the shutter, if your answer is NO, then GET CLOSER.    This is a point I HATE seeing on this and any other subreddit. No, I'm not going to be in Magnum. But what's the harm in making myself better? By being strict on myself? People who are good at things WORK FOR IT. If I sat around not trying to improve to chase ""being the great,"" I'll be stuck in a plateau of mediocre work.  There's my discussion of the OP's shitty and condescending list. In another note, pay attention to those who give good critique on this subreddit. You'll pick up on them because they'll be honest and say when an image is weak instead of saying ""Great job!"" and nothing else. Their critique is more important than two word replies on how great you are because they usually have more knowledge in this genre.  TL;DR: Read it, because I'm sick of having to say this every time someone gets defensive or personal on a negative critique."
streetphotography,39kcbv,Lucretian,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"and so what?  you came to test the waters, ready to bristle at any critique?  i have to agree with /u/arteryal: some knob flexing for the camera does not an interesting photo make.  furthermore, if you feel a critique is harsh, your only dignified option is to ignore it.  complaining about it only demonstrates that you posted in poor faith to begin with.  downvoting your critics or challenging the critic to post their own work are even worse, more petulant behaviors.  don't do any of that.  please do return with more interesting photos.  happy shooting."

Look at how the light is so significant to this shot. It's like the guitar is presenting that large shadow on the building, when it's actually the pole. Look at the lines in the shot, the boxes, the shapes. Look at the three talking on a smoke break, ignoring the busker. It's not my favourite shot by him, but it's a good one regardless."

streetphotography,39jxug,Lakston,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"I use the x-t1 and am generally happy with it. I've had a lot of fun in recent times using the automatic intervalometer added in a recent firmware update and walking through one of the local flea markets. Set it at taking a photo every 3 seconds, 100 times, and see what happens. People don't really love getting photographed there, but it's not my fault the camera happens to be aiming at them when I'm looking elsewhere. I don't publish any of these online, but it's a fun technique. You feel like james bond. Only problem: photos are taken from too low a lot of the time (hard to look inconspicuous with the camera on your shoulder, and I'm short). Also, I once accidentally photographed a pickpocket (on someone else) that way.  The x-t1 often gets ignored because it looks like a film SLR to people who don't really know anything about cameras. I get a feeling this will change with more people buying that and the olympus or even the a7.  At the moment I only use the 18-55 ""kit"" lens at between 20-40mm, still looking for a sweetspot. Ideally, I want to get a 23mm or 35mm for street shooting but money is tight. Soon.  Overall I'm happy with it. I'm not too good at street photography, but I was happy enough with one photo to post it here.  I am strongly debating getting a new strap. The standard one is okay, but I want to have a look around. Thing is, I don't know where to start for that."
streetphotography,39k9pp,tclayson,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:01:26 2015 UTC,Nice spot. But why ISO100? Why not bump up to 800 or something and get it sharp?
streetphotography,39k9pp,X100TConvert,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:09:48 2015 UTC,"It was probably on auto ISO. I usually set it to manual or shutter priority and let the ISO adjust itself to adjust exposure where necessary.  I think the lack of sharpness is because of the low aperture. I was walking when I shot this and must have moved the subject out of the focal plane before pressing the shutter. Annoying, because I really want it to be sharp. But I've learnt my lesson! f/8 and be there, as they say."
streetphotography,39k9pp,X100TConvert,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:15:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. With ISO these days you can really set it to 800/1600 in daylight, f/8 and auto ss.   I only just got back in taking shots recently and back when I was shooting a lot 800 was the highest I would go near, if even. I was blown away to see people shooting at 300, 6400 and I sometimes shoot at 22,000 or whatever it is and am happy enough. Crazy."

streetphotography,39k9pp,loskillergypsy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I was trying to portray the casualness of the guy, his pose etc. Like he's just there, part of the scenery, no-one was noticing him, he didn't feel that he looked eccentric, so I tried to bring in some of the background.  Plus physically I wanted to get a face-on shot of him, as a shot from the side wouldn't have worked as well, there were people at the tables to the right of me and I didn't want to alert the guy to me taking pictures of him, I wanted it nice and candid.  But I completely understand what you're saying and agree."
streetphotography,39k9pp,haggertyjmn,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:41:14 2015 UTC,The subject and feel really remind me of a series taken by one of the earlier street photographers. I think it may have been one of the founders of magnum but I can't for the life of me remember who. I don't think it is but it could have been something Cartier-Bresson took when he was in Asia?

I noticed you have quite a big grain structure on both pictures, may I ask what you are shooting with ?  If that is what you are going for then no worries but I wouldn't mind a little noise reduction. Also they appear tinted on my shitty laptop screen (wich is not a great tool to judge this kind of thing), if they are I would prefer plain B&W, if not, nevermind me and my POS laptop :)"

I wish he stuck around for a bit longer, just so I can learn more about/from him. But whatever he left behind is good enough already, we still haven't gone through all of his work... So there's more we can discover.  A simple but mostly looked over principle he mentioned was   ""I try to frame in terms of what I want to include."""

So there's more we can discover.     ugh sorry man, I dislike this kind of thing. Leave the man alone, he's gone now and he's given what he chose to give, let's not go scavenging through his closet. Even though he didn't curate his work or his books, he obviously had to have some say in whether or not they were published in the way they were. Ultimately, his publications had to meet whatever arbitrary standards he had for himself. Who are we to defy that and tear through his archives? and if someone who doesn't have his quality of vision publishes anything of his, the only thing it will achieve is to dilute his genius.    Same goes for Vivian Maier. I'm disgusted by what the vultures are doing. If someone dies prematurely and their work goes unseen, it's a shame, but so be it."
streetphotography,39g71a,arteryal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:59:20 2015 UTC,"It's cool man, I can understand where you're coming from.   This type of issue reminds me of one that was brought up between Charlie Kirk, and a bunch of other photographers on Twitter regarding the Vivian Maier documentary. Some interesting points made from all sides but I can't help but agree with what Matt Stuart and Richard Bram had to say.  Here's the link to the tweet: https://twitter.com/twocutedogs/status/568808966312108032  Obviously I wouldn't want Garry's work to be treated in the same regard as Maier's... But honestly, if his archived work was some how distributed for free, for the sake of those who are curious of what more he potentially brought, without money or estates or ownership or any of that shit being factors... I'd totally jump in on it. Of course that's just my opinion."
streetphotography,39g71a,arteryal,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:57:49 2015 UTC,Yeah and this is going to sound hypocritical but I would too. There's no question that I would want to see his (and others) entire archives. It would be an immensely valuable resource for learning but at the same time I don't think that should ever happen.

streetphotography,39g6it,wsteinh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:42:53 2015 UTC,"Its an interesting moment, but the motion blur is the main thing that stands out to me, and personally I the way it was done here hurts the image more than it helps, especially since it cuts into your subject.  I also think the entire right half could be cropped out (maybe go from the 110 to the left side), but I also think that needed to be done with your feet to get all of the people sharper and larger.    This, however, is the part of street photography that I think is the hardest both to learn and to even do, because in order to get closer, you really need to anticipate the moment ahead of time, which tends to be some combination of luck, experience, being in the right mood, and trying enough times that you eventually get a success.  When I am walking around, I generally try to look about 20-30 feet ahead of me for people that are in some way interesting, unique, or seem to be doing interesting things or making interesting faces.  Then I just try to be prepared and hope I catch them a the ""right"" moment.  I think the only thing one can do is try this enough that eventually get a good shot.  Hope this was helpful."

streetphotography,39gdm1,seikoliz,2,Thu Jun 11 15:21:58 2015 UTC,Uhhh is there a non-offensive way to read that title?
streetphotography,39gdm1,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Thu Jun 11 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"Simply juxtaposing ""Brute"" written on the trash can and the color yellow that is the focal point. Not intending to imply the woman is a brute, just being lazy feigning cleverness with the title.  :p"
streetphotography,39gdm1,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Thu Jun 11 15:45:41 2015 UTC,"Didn't see the trash can. Still though, I don't think that's the first thing people see when they look at this picture after reading your title.  I'd recommend changing it.  Honestly it's very distracting to even look at the picture and judge it not in the context of the pretty explicit racial implications."
streetphotography,39gdm1,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"Duly noted - it's been up for a while now so I am not sure how effectual changing it at this point would be, but I never even considered the title as having any inherent racial implications (unless, perhaps, I have an unfounded dislike of trash cans? :p  )."
streetphotography,39gdm1,aroundthewell,2,Thu Jun 11 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"By your own admission, the subject of you photo is the sanitation worker.  She is wearing all yellow.  The title of your post is ""yellow brute"".  The sanitation working is a person of color.  The word ""brute"" is LOADED with historical significance as it has been used to demean and dehumanize people of color, black people in particular, for a very long time.   See the black brute steerotype http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Black_brute  Thus, whether intentional or not, you are evoking a very clear racist stereotype.  The trash can is not the subject of you photo and the word ""brute"" is very small and utterly meaningless to the content of the photo.  There's no way around it...this is utterly offensive."
streetphotography,39gdm1,myfavoriteorganelle,3,Thu Jun 11 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"As a former janitor, I didn't even notice any racial intent. In both places I worked, those large trash cans (brand name Brute) were simply referred to as Brutes. ""Empty that brute."" ""Be sure to clean the outside of your brute.""

I do a lot of real estate shooting in DC, but I always make it a point to carry my EP3 w/ 45mm f/1.8 for my best take at street shooting from the car window as I'm stuck at stop signs, red lights and congested traffic (DC is a scenic city in general). In the instance of this photo, it had just poured pretty hard while I was conducting a basement apartment shoot but the rain let up despite a still heavily clouded sky. Everything just kind of pops after a rainfall, and street sanitation workers didn't waste any time getting back into the mix. Really I was just attracted to the color, bright yellows and all, but the sanitation workers expression toward the biker was pretty spot on.

The content of your image isn't getting any attention because it isn't commanding any. i.e. there's no interest in it."

Part of me wants to see what it would have looked like if you actually stepped back two feet to get the top of the lion and everybody's feet, and maybe even raised the camera up high to get the lion's head ad the same level as the statues.  Lastly, I can't tell if the photographer to the far left adds enough to the picture.  Hope you don't mind that I tried two other crops on the image.  Not sure they are better, but once focus the scene on the main three people, and the second tries to play a little more on the ""statement"" by cutting off the statue's heads, and also has a little play with the small lion head next to the headless lion.  Might be worth playing with a bit.  Awesome shot.  Two Crops"

To me, that's not really the issue when I look at these images.  It's more that they are fairly generic scenes and don't hold the viewers attention.  You've taken nice photographs but I don't think you've really capture any memorable moments and that's what street photography is really all about.  Your ""keepers"" should be the photos that aren't easily replicated.  The photo of a guy smoking, for instance, would be very easy to replicate any given day at any given time. Therefore it's not particularly interesting for me as a viewer.  Try to hold out for more interesting subjects, doing more interesting things, in more interesting compositions."

streetphotography,395s84,wsteinh,4,Tue Jun 9 16:43:39 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to get to close man     this seems to be the favourite key word nowadays when trying to critique street photos.  it's such a generic terminology, usually used by people who just discovered bruce gilden or eric kim. if i am trying to capture people's faces and emotions, i will get close, but if i'm trying to capture the whole environment and setting they are in, why would i need to get into their faces. for example: This photo of a guy smoking i specifically wanted to capture the scene.  i liked how he was standing straight up on the edge of a sidewalk, having a smoke break.  that was my goal.  i did not want to get any closer to lose the effect and the mood i was going after. The guy walking under the ramp This was exactly how I wanted to capture this shot.  I wanted all those lines to be visible and someone walking under it.  my goal with this shot wasn't meant to show person's face and emotions, so i did not need to get closer. This lady checking out a mango I think I used 17mm to capture this one.  I was basically standing half a meter from her.  I wanted to capture her expression and face while she was smelling a mango fruit so of course I got close. Same with this business man I was basically right beside him.  Half a meter, the most, 17mm. Now, i don't want to go through all 20 photos, but all this ""don't be afraid to get too close"" is so generic and over used, especially when not used constructively.      your shots are all mediocre     ok, appreciate your opinion.     They don't tell a story.     Well, this is the thing, I was not trying to tell a story.  Why would I need to?  This was not part of an assignment or magazine article or anything like that.  I was simply taking photos of people on the street going about their lives.  That's it.  As simple as that.  I was not trying to tell anything with these shots.  This is another very generic, over used, terminology that often times starts a never ending debate of ""what is street photography"".  I am definitely not getting into that discussion right now, so I'll leave it at that.     The watermark is ugly also. Just put it in the title.     On several occasions, I found that my photos were being used for commercial and promotional purposes without my permission.  I started using this to prevent that, at least to make it a little harder , if anything,  so that will stay there, I will probably decrease the opacity more."

There's potentially a much, much more interesting photo here. Do yourself a favour, go back and try to make as many different images as possibly utilising that graphic element and different focal lengths.    In regards to a comment you made elsewhere. Whatever the experience (with photography or otherwise) of the people commenting in this thread, one thing is for certain, they aren't connecting with your images."
streetphotography,395s84,wsteinh,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:47:13 2015 UTC,"You are showing 20 photos you shot (and maybe plan to show more since this is vol. 1).  What is the point of showing all of this if it is not to ""tell a story"".  I put that in quotes because I also agree that you don't necessarily need to tell a story with every photo, but I find that whenever people say ""tell a story"" what they usually mean is ""create an emotive response"".  I think that is the primary goal of any artistic work.  I think what systrom is saying is that your work did not do this, and I agree.  Furthermore, I think one of the main reasons that your images doing create this response is that, in fact, you are not getting close enough.  I also don't know why people think that the only way to get close is to get Gilden-style super close.   YOU DON'T!  However, all of your images have a person as  the subject, and about 600 years of art has shown that viewers connect most with people through the face and the eyes.  If your goal is to showcase a human element (which based on what you've shown, it is) then you want to get as much of their face and eyes in the frame as possible.  You can also achieve this by cropping you photos much more, which I would also suggest for many of your images.  I'll go through the four images you specifically highlighted:  1) Man smoking on the street: You said you wanted to capture the mood.  What mood is that?  What do all the people on the left side add to that mood? Why not crop them out?  Maybe you wanted to capture the tension of him standing on the end of the sidewalk, but you upped the contrast so much that its hard to tell where the sidewalk stops and road begins.   It probably would have been shown better if you stepped into the street and shot him in profile, lining up with the edge of the sidewalk.  That would have highlighted the drama, and what is interesting about the shot.  2) Man under ramp:  Why did yo choose that man, and why did you want him there?  What did it add to the shot?  Who have a person at all?  If the person is important to the shot, why that person?  All the leading lines in the scene draw your eye AWAY from the man. I think this shot could have been awesome if you had stepped to your left a bit, waited for a person to come under the lines so they led to him or her, and then hopefully got them looking up, making some expression.  This would require you to be closer.  3) Mango lady: Probably the shot I liked the most, but the background and editing are both really distracting.  I would have liked to see more of her face, just moving the camera a foot or two to the left could have solved this problem.  4) Buisiness man: You go close to him, but not in front.  You see not of his face and thus dont connect with him.  How is somebody supposed to respond to this image, and what in the image should create this response.  Lastly, the most important thing you need is to be more self critical and edit yourself more.  You showed a whopping 20 images.  Did you want a critique of each and every one?  Did you all think they were spectacular enough?  What was the point of showing all of this together?  If you showed one or two, or even maybe the five best of these, people might be more inclined to actually offer useful advice.  Furthermore, you were really rude to the one person who was willing to look through your images and give you a critique.  You can't be that defensive if you ever want people to seriously critique you."

streetphotography,395s84,lidocaineus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for trying to insult me and not responding at all to the carefully though out critique I spent a lot of time writing for you.  I haven't posted my work yet because I have high standards for what I want to do, and know that very little of what I shot is worth showing.  I work hard trying to actually actually understand why its not very good and improve upon those things, rather than showing people a bunch of uninteresting pictures, hoping somebody will praise me, and getting super defensive when they don't.  Another thing you need to learn about is humility.  When I feel like I've shot something good, I'd love to hear what you think of it."
streetphotography,3919d1,myfavoriteorganelle,4,Mon Jun 8 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"Your bottom section is too chaotic. The processing is crap (IMHO) but the idea is good. I would have gone in closer and just framed the head with whatever remaining balloons there would be floating above. This way, it would have made for a better floating head/balloon juxta (I assume) you were going for."
streetphotography,3919d1,ronseephotography,2,Mon Jun 8 16:23:49 2015 UTC,Agreed about the processing.  Quick edit on my phone to hear feedback.  You think this crop helps?  Stick with BW (but better)?  http://i.imgur.com/hYrAnox.jpg
streetphotography,3919d1,WVY,3,Mon Jun 8 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"Whoa, why did you go with black and white? The color makes this (for me). The connection between the man and the balloon is further emphasized with the color in play. The crop does make it better, but by moving in closer you won't have to compromise your photo by cropping. Working the scene in this case also helps. Use your feet next time! They are your best tools for framing."
streetphotography,3919d1,Dannah573,3,Mon Jun 8 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I actually got a shot or two that were closer in but Mr. blue got spooked and moved his head.  I think I just wanted it to work in BW because I think it fits in with a small set that are also in BW.  Last thing I'll bother you with.  Thoughts on this edit?

This is where my point for getting closer helps. By getting closer you'll fill much of the frame with the mans head and you'll get about 2-4 balloons over top of him... Which IS enough to use in context of your juxta, you don't need to get all of those balloons... Just enough to make your point.  Edit: down votes are fine but if you disagree with me at least challenge my point."

streetphotography,38ys7l,bruceface,3,Mon Jun 8 00:04:13 2015 UTC,"Tear me a new one guys, I'm ready, be as brutally honest as I know you can be, I need to hear it.  I won my first ever exhibition which will be at the 2015 independent photography festival in Melbourne, from a photo I entered in the 2014 one. It was the first time I'd actually sought to actively promote my work and a huge surprise to win. I have no idea what I'm going to show at this point, I've always self edited and would really appreciate hearing from people. There's no real cohesive body of work that I've been able to put together yet (though there's some attempts at grouping). Also, any thoughts on the website I've thrown together too. Mainly, should I get rid of the black and white stuff altogether? I've only ever shot a few rolls, can't see myself going back any time soon, so it's pretty weak, but I'm really attached to the first photo of the girl with the contact lens shine. What do you like? What do you hate? Also really interested to hear your take on the Gonzo street stuff. The idea behind it is taking something real, like film and street photography, and trying to keep that look but adding obvious bullshit into it. I know that's pretty taboo in 'the scene' though. There's also a link to my blog on the site if you can be bothered looking at/commenting on any more, would appreciate it. Thanks!  http://lucewillis.com"
streetphotography,38ys7l,wsteinh,2,Mon Jun 8 04:56:16 2015 UTC,"Take this with a grain of salt, as I have only been more seriously working on street photography for a few months, and haven't even felt comfortable showing the stuff I've shot yet.  But, I think critiquing can help me as much as you, and you specifically asked to eviscerated.  The gonzo stuff is probably the most interesting, but also, definitely on the outermost fringes of ""street photography"" at best.  In fact, I think it highlights what I would say is the biggest flaw of the rest of your work, namely, much of it lacks a compelling subject.  In the home category, I think images 1,3, and 5 at least have some sort of subject and are probably the best, but even for those, the subject is more something abstract about photography like contrast, movement, or color.  For the rest, I would look at each image and ask myself what the viewer is supposed to read, or react to, or how they should respond the the image.    I think that great street photography shows more than what is literally in the frame.  The viewer should respond with humor, sadness, awe, joy, horror, something, anything.  Looking at some examples from what you've shot: ""A man counting money on a bench, shot from behind"".  What else does this image show? ""A man waiting at a bus stop in front of a city"" What is in this frame, besides what is literally there? ""Two garbage cans and a hand closing a door"" What emotional response should the viewer have to this image?  Go through all the images you've shown and ask similar questions.  I would probably get rid of the black and white, but I like the second image (though I would like to see a version with the contrast brought down just a bit so that I could see just a little more of the woman).  I think the website is very well designed.  Overall, I think you have a really good eye for street photography and that you've definitely developed a sense of personal style.  I think the key thing you need to do going forward is focus on finding clear subjects, filling the frame with it, and editing yourself down a bit to work that really evokes emotions."
streetphotography,38ys7l,bruceface,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much, I was beginning to think no one was going to reply. I have found that I end up taking more abstract shots lately, working with scale or just looking for balance, trying to capture a general feeling instead of straight documentation, which is probably just wanky bullshit I tell myself after running around with an external flash like Gilden didn't work for me.  I actually removed that photo of the kid with the money yesterday morning then put it back because I couldn't decide on what I'd replace the thumbnail with on the opening page. Any suggestions on what you think the strongest image in 'Home' is to replace the thumbnail? Totally agree though. Just so you know, he isn't just a guy, he's just a kid, he's also the what we call a 'lad'. They're usually graffers, this one's most likely a drug dealer, the go to uniform is the the big nikes, shorts, bum bag, he's even wearing 'speed dealer sunnies', which are those sunglasses you can buy from a servo that all the scumbags wear. The exposure is way off though, and there isn't really anything else there, so you're right.  With the other two you've mentioned I like them for the balance, but have always wondered if that's just something I see or if others do too. I guess not. The bins one, I like the three fingers and the three main circles from the two wheels and the shadow the sign makes (also how the sign then points you back to the fingers). The 'bus stop' one, I like how all the lines from the buildings and the tram tracks all converge into the guy's head, I also really like the light. But good to know you don't see any of that, I did wonder, thanks again for taking the time!"
streetphotography,38ys7l,wsteinh,2,Mon Jun 8 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"I would say for the website, the birds one is probably the most eye catching for people to click on as the thumbnail.  The other two scenes, I would say that the fact that he's a 'lad' is hard to read from the context.  I sort of figured that, but at least to an american that is lost in translation.  I would say for the train tracks one, you found a good spot, you just need to ""work the scene"".  I would just keep going back there and waiting for a bit, see if an interesting person comes by or does something interesting that then elevates the image even further.  The bins one didn't really do anything for me, but it doesn't mean that it might not for somebody else.  You don't have to be Bruce Gilden-level intrusive to get pictures of people, but at the same time, every time I read about a great photographer (or artist or musician of any kind really), they almost always talk about how they create art almost exclusively for them selves.  I think you will take better pictures if you shoot the stuff you like.  If capture scale and balance are the things about street photography that excite you the most, I think thats what you should do, but those things can still evoke emotions (thats actually what I like most about the first image of the woman and the windows).  If thats what you like, you should work on finding the ways to make that emotive, and to showcase the human element (which I personally think is vital to street photography).  I think a great place to look is the work of Trent Parke.  Very rarely does his work have a obvious human subject that has a face or expression, but he finds ways to create extremely emotive images almost exclusively through clever usage of light and contrast."

streetphotography,38ys7l,myfavoriteorganelle,2,Tue Jun 9 06:22:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of wsteinh is saying.  I'm not in love with many of the pictures but it does seem like you're really developing a personal style, which is not trivial. I was left wondering if the detachment from human subjects was on purpose.  It sounds like it's a combination of on purpose and not being super comfortable with getting closer.  I'd recommend trying to push yourself to get those more intimate/closer shots and see if you they fit with what you are trying to do.  If not, then I think you can still make a compelling image without a clearly defined/up close human subject.  To me if feels like what you are trying to accomplish with your images might not really fit in with a strict idea of street photography but again ""fitting in"" shouldn't necessarily be your guide. In short, I think you could have a stronger set of images but I like that you are doing something a little different.  Keep shooting.  P.S. I think I like the last (or is it the first?) image from ""Abroad"" the most....the one with the motion blur."

I do like the disconnect you describe, but understand that's not typically a good thing for street.

streetphotography,38ys7l,solidsnaaaake,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"Hey man, just wanted to reply to this before I posted my page to be critiqued as well. The first thing I notice about your work is that it has a good feeling to it. Now, what I mean by that is that I can actually sense an appreciation for the craft by looking at your body of work as a whole entity. Individually, the photos I think need a bit of work on subject matter and individuality. I can, right now, go on Tumblr and find similar snapshots to yours.   That being said, you have soul. Your work has soul. I find myself wondering what you will do next, and I think that is important to note."
streetphotography,38ys7l,Lucretian,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:55:33 2015 UTC,"my immediate reactions:   individual photos are generally decent in the sense that most have clear subjects, some compositional interest, and engage me for a few moments. you've assembled them into collections, which prompts me to wonder if they're studies of some sort.  as far as i can tell, there is no thematic coherence to the groupings.  you can swap any photo from gonzo to home or abroad or whatever, and i'm not sure it makes a difference.  that's a major weak spot.   keep working it."
streetphotography,38ys7l,VeinyPickle,2,Fri Jun 12 16:29:33 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/mI8a8db.jpg  What do you guys think? Is the composition too poor or the content too weak?
streetphotography,38ys7l,bruceface,3,Mon Jun 8 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"In short, yeah, and the exposure is way under, it just makes it look bland and murky. I guess it was the hat you were going for and the hands were a bonus, or the other way round. The woman on the far left does nothing for it, and the eye contact even distracts further. If anything I think it could've been interesting if shot tall with just the guy in the frame with the extra hand as he tries to use his phone. Shot from down by the phone/hands, facing up to see his face. Just so more of the frame is relevant. The fact you took a photo of the front of people is a good start though."
streetphotography,38ys7l,VeinyPickle,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"On point. This image was a throwaway because I fucked up the composition this badly. It's a shame, because otherwise I liked the couple's hands and phones."

streetphotography,38ys7l,wsteinh,2,Wed Jun 10 23:58:20 2015 UTC,"Your shots are beautiful.  They have an excellent sense of balance, and you have a wonderful eye for the form of the world around us.  The biggest ""criticism"" I can give is that you shoot everything like a landscape or architecture photographer.  The humans are never (rarely?) the subject of your photos.  Everything makes the people in the photos seem small and insignificant, which is the reaction I have most strongly to these images (which I think is a good thing, if thats the reaction you were hoping for).  Even if its outside of your style, you could probably learn a lot by trying to capture more about people, their reactions and their emotions.  I think by far your weakest images are your portraits, where the people are very static, emotionless, and disinterested (they are shot like they are architecture themselves).  I think if you work on this and can find a way to capture both a sense of surrounding scale, as well as a human emotion in the same image, it will elevate things to yet another level.  Some specific thoughts (since you said to be as mean as I wanted...): Because the people are only important because of their location, there were a few times that the image would be much better if they were shot a second before or after (the man on the stairs being right in the middle of the light, the person being directly above the arrow on the one way sign).  I would probably weed out some of the more ""generic"" images (train platform, blurred people in front of an alley, tall shot of a cityscape).  They are nice, well shot, but your other stuff is more unique and interesting, and I think it benefits you not to take attention away from them.  The shot of the meat in the grocery store I think is the weakest.  Really beautiful work, hope any of my thoughts are helpful."
streetphotography,38ys7l,solidsnaaaake,2,Thu Jun 11 00:51:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your reply. I appreciate that first paragraph a lot. Thank you.  I do agree with your criticisms, and I appreciate it. I've been craving a change from my architectural/landscape centered shooting style. I am looking to shoot more in front of people, having them be the subject, rather than stay behind or on the side of them. I've become too comfortable shooting from the shadows and being unnoticed by the people that I shoot. For the last couple of years, I've tried to keep it like that, but am now ready for change.   Your thoughts are very helpful, and as I shoot today I will think about them and implement your advice into my shooting. Thanks again!"

streetphotography,38x1z7,VeinyPickle,5,Sun Jun 7 15:54:54 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of his work but it took me awhile to understand it.  This is my first time trying to analyze all of my thoughts on his ideas and his photographs but at the very least, I'll try to explain why I enjoy what he does so much.  His work is about connecting with being a normal human being.  He tries to highlight everyday life in a way that it becomes interesting.  Things like being a tourist or a consumer are worthy of documentation to him because they play major roles in our society’s culture.  The work you linked to, The Last Resort, is documentation of New Brighton's seaside in the 80's.  At the time of this project, Margaret Thatcher had just become Prime Minister and spoke highly of the UK, saying how great it was.  Parr wanted to pick out a poor and run-down area to show how the country was actually falling apart and at the same time, how normal life goes on.  He has said in interviews that he tries to ""explore the difference between the mythology of the place and the reality of it.""  I think this idea is very relevant to this particular project.  For example, the repeating theme of vacationing families having fun in front of a back drop of trash and run-down buildings.  The whole series is one big juxtaposition and you will often see contrasting ideas in a lot of his other work.  I really love image #24 from the project. Look at how the expressions on the people's faces tell a story.  He's captured a moment.  This is something I see in a lot of his photos and is something that he does very well.  Some other things I enjoy and frequently look for in all of his work are the usage of color theory and composition.  He is a master of both.  I think that someone who is new to his work might over look smaller details like this because his photographs are often so common-place and so familiar that the viewer can easily dismiss the picture.   I believe that it’s essential for someone looking at his work to view a project in its entirety.  For example, Parking Spaces..  ""The accumulated photographs will tantalize the viewer by showing them one thing they will always be searching for in life, somewhere to park the car."" I love this project because the idea is both socially accurate on a global scale and hilarious.  If you were to take a single image from that series and present it by itself, I don't think it would be particularly strong.  But as a group of images made from 28 different countries, the idea that ""trying to find parking is a global problem"" is very true and the series comes to life.   Another project similar to Parking Spaces is Mobile Phones.  Again, he is working on a global scale and focusing on an object that people in different cultures care about.   When I was first introduced to his work my initial reaction was one of confusion.  I didn't understand what he was trying to say and I definitely didn't get why Magnum Photos decided to represent him.  It confused me to see his name next to photographers that have photographed wars, social injustice, and historical events.  However, in order to accurately document the ""human element"" of the world at large, a goal that Magnum photographers accomplish beautifully, the things Martin Parr photographs have to be included and taken seriously because they’re a part of being human in today’s world.  His subjects might not be what documentary photographers would traditionally focus on, but they're just as important because they're so ingrained in our day to day life.  I hope I've accurately represented him.   I really love his work!  There are numerous videos on him that are really good, btw.  Here is a good one on just him and here is another about Magnum in general but there is a big emphasis placed on Parr’s work and how it fits in with Magnum’s goals.    TLDR: Martin Parr's work requires a fair amount of effort to understand."
streetphotography,38x1z7,defff_metal,3,Mon Jun 8 03:26:20 2015 UTC,His work is brilliant. Basically what he's doing is holding a mirror up to western society and shattering delusions of grandeur.    What do you think of his work?
streetphotography,38x1z7,arteryal,2,Sun Jun 7 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"I love his work as his use of ""humour"" fits well with his projects. He's one of the cases where his personality and humour is directly reflected onto his work.  More specifically, he documents the lower, middle, and upper class in a way to show that they're not as glamorous as perceived.  I'm curious how other people may think of his work because honestly, the images standalone are not exactly ""pretty"" in content or style."
streetphotography,38x1z7,timdesuyo,5,Mon Jun 8 02:15:15 2015 UTC,I think that he doesn't elevate - he documents. And that doesn't sit well with some people. They want to see a prettier world.

streetphotography,38x1z7,defff_metal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:25:13 2015 UTC,What do you mean by elevate?  To me there is more than just taking a picture to document something going on.  I think he totally elevates things.  The manner in which he takes photographs elevates ordinary objects or people.  The film he uses (or editing style and color correction nowadays) and his ring flash are chosen specifically to make his subjects stand out and have importance placed on them.

streetphotography,38n32y,Lumpiest_Princess,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:42:45 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how one can take 400 film and ""push"" it to 1600? I know a little about film,  but isn't the iso a physical part of the film,  silver pieces and all...  Is it a mechanism in the camera that changes the iso?"
streetphotography,38n32y,sjsuismylife,3,Fri Jun 5 10:46:02 2015 UTC,"I just started developing, but I can explain simply. The ISO is a measurement of how sensitive the film is. So, 400 film performs best at 400, 3200 performs best at 3200, etc.   Although the film is rated 400, lower levels of light can still change the chemicals on it (to a point). For this roll, I told my camera that the film was 1600, even though on the carton it's rated at 400. This made the light meter and A priority recommend shutter/aperture adjustments like the film was actually 1600. On film cameras, the ISO dial exists only to tell auto and priority modes what sort of film is in the camera. Adjusting it doesn't physically change the film at all.   When I developed the film, I had to leave it in the developer for a longer period of time than I would have if I'd exposed it at 400, since the chemicals on the film were less affected by the lower light (faster shutter. etc.).   This method causes some loss of contrast in the shadows, especially if I had pushed 100ISO film to 3200, or 6400. Certain developers have slightly different chemistry and push film better or worse. The farthest I've pushed this film is 3200 – pretty far for a cheap film – and the loss of detail is very evident: https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7772/18225481921_43d73f09c9_o.jpg"
streetphotography,38n32y,sjsuismylife,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:03:42 2015 UTC,Thanks. That clears it up some. Just can't fully wrap my head around film.
streetphotography,38n32y,ugly_whiskey_smoker,2,Fri Jun 5 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're basically underexposing by two stops. That allows one to shoot handheld in low light by allowing for faster shutter speeds. The trade off is, like they said, lack of detail. Because the film isn't being hit with the optimum amount of light.   However, you can still pull a decent image from the negative because you leave it in the developing chemical (that brings out the image) longer- to compensate for the fact the images were underexposed."
streetphotography,38diuj,WillzyxTheZypod,3,Wed Jun 3 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"Super cool!  Out of curiosity, since you seem to be Chicago based and another submission the other day was too, is there a group somewhere for street photography in Chicago?"
streetphotography,38diuj,BlueLu,2,Wed Jun 3 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"That's a good question.  I'm not sure if there is a group/club geared toward street photographers, but Out of Chicago (http://outofchicago.com/) holds photo walks every now and then.  I also just learned about the Fort Dearborn-Chicago Photo Forum, but I am not certain how active they are.

streetphotography,38diuj,beasy4sheezy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"this is marvelous. i love the reflections of wet concrete/cement and this is a great way to explore it. the face on the building is excellent. i didn't see it at first and i love when there's more to notice in the photograph than just the first glance. i also get this timeless feeling from it. the way the reflections distort the details makes me feel like this photo could have been taken during the 50's or maybe 70's or pretty much whenever. the timeless feeling coupled with the face on the building creates this great juxtaposition between old and new.  if i could say one thing, i think it could benefit if the ""real"" portion were cropped out. i can see why you might want to keep it to show the viewer how the photo was taken, but i kind of like the mystery. before i saw the real part, i was mesmerized by the beautiful texture and was wondering how you managed it. cropping the real portion would also help hide the lower shutter speed that caused the real man's foot to blur. the reflections blurs everything already so the reflectioned foot would blend right in. then again i could see that the cropping might make the composition weird having the people at the very bottom of the frame. or maybe it would have been cool if the reflection was more centered and there was equal weight in the photo between the real and reflection.  sorry, didn't mean to go on so long. i just loved the picture so much."
streetphotography,38d97m,Jcwolfe00,0,Wed Jun 3 13:47:58 2015 UTC,Why did you compose this vertically? The tops of buildings don't add anything to this photo. Are you trying to say something about the bikes or cars?

The girl kissing the guy definitely presents a nice little moment the light is great - would be nice to see his reaction but I think this is a good one. I like them I have to say, I think shooting with a point and squirt has given you an ability to roam around and get amongst the hubbub of NYC - my advice would be exploit this more. Get right up to people, they will probably think you're just a buffoon with a crap camera, smile and say thanks and off you go. Well done for sharing, feedback can be hard but always useful.

streetphotography,38boww,scenesofnewyorkcity,3,Wed Jun 3 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"I really like these. Every aspect pretty much. Reminds me of the early Joel Meyerowitz stuff, which is right up my street. Specifically the topless black guy, elmo, and the guy with the mice. I feel like the composition itself could be made a little tighter, but that isn't everything. Good composition and boring subjects make for boring photography in my opinion. Just keep getting out there and you'll do great, and improve."
streetphotography,38boww,DillonVFX,2,Wed Jun 3 15:52:37 2015 UTC,The word I would use to describe this series is safe. The compositions are getting static to me and I see it because it is something I try to improve in my own work.  Your compositions are accurate but in a compartmental way.  I would not notice it if I was only looking at one shot.  But as I scroll through the series I begin to see a theme to the way you compose your pictures.  Everything tends to be a safe distance from the edges of the frame.  The only picture that breaks away from this is the shot of the girl and the doll.  I think it will add some energy to your images to funk it up a little and break out of having them so perfect. I never feel there are forces pushing in or out of the frame. It all feels very balanced and after a while It all tends to feel very safe.
streetphotography,38boww,lidocaineus,2,Fri Jun 5 14:07:01 2015 UTC,"It is obviously absurd to expect several good shots out of 2 rolls, but it more absurd to think people should only be sharing their very best for critique.  Obviously he knows they're not all great.  This is the age of the internet and social media, where we post and share things every day as part of a stream-of-consciousness type of dialogue with our subscribers/followers. We can't share truly great shots on our blogs/instagrams daily, but we can share things we saw, how we saw them. We're not all curating for a book or a show.  Anyway, as for the shots, I like them. I personally think they could improve if you got closer. Best wishes. Just got a ricoh gr1v as a gift and I am over the fucking moon. Film point and shoot 4life"
streetphotography,38boww,VeinyPickle,-6,Sun Jun 7 05:36:15 2015 UTC,"You need to be much tighter with your editing. It's almost impossible to get more than 1 great street photo out of one months of photography let alone 8 photos out of 2 rolls. A lot of the photos feel like snapshots, there isn't much of a visual relationship between the elements in the frames. Look at the great street photos throughout history and hit the street more and don't expect to get a good hit rate out of 2 rolls of film."
streetphotography,38boww,myfavoriteorganelle,7,Wed Jun 3 06:38:41 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, only show the very best, look at the very best. If I were in a show, I would probably pick one of these. I do hit the street, constantly, nearly every day or i'm developing film. I look at your comment history though, and you only say super negative things in this sub. I can get frustrated in this sub or flickr, with miscatagorized work etc but you can't expect anyone to grow if you can't find anything positive in at least someones work. I have totally done this(especially intoxicated) and I consider it a bad habit to post super negative things online. Whats the expression... your first 10,000 are your worst? Mean while, I do enjoy some of your photos but they aren't so radically different from the ones you are constantly hating on? Just an observation."

Instead of getting all the extraneous people, you could've picked out the important moment contained within: one of the guys looking back at the women. Reframe it so it isolated just him and the women (or woman). Bonus points for doing it all Ingmar Bergman-style with a huge head in the foreground and deep depth of field to a much smaller group of women in the background (actually, if you would've pulled that off, I would've paid you for a print).

I actually learned a lot from our useful admin (Nonchalant Elephant) and his effort in updating the wiki. Now I feel that this place has turned into a shit-hole because of heads thinking their first street photo is superb, egos that only seek for comments to feed their confidence as they masturbate in front of a vanity mirror, and those with a slight following that want to promote their shitty blog/work.  Also, I know some of the criticism is well-intended and all... But I feel like one really needs to know how to read a photograph before putting in any of their input. Can one really find a story just by looking at a profile of a head? Or is it just bullshit being passed off as 'being deep'? Do we really have to find stories in street photography? Can't we just see whether elements in a rectangle make the frame work aesthetically?  Yeah, I sound bitter about it. And truthfully, I am. I love the genre, I deeply respect it, and to see it turn into basically another /r/analog - but only with photos of people's backs or a person walking in front of a wall/mural/public art.  Go ahead, put me on blast. Whatever."
streetphotography,380ocs,lidocaineus,2,Tue Jun 2 05:10:56 2015 UTC,"I've only been perusing this sub for about a month, so if it's changed significantly since prior, take that into consideration.

So I'm not sure where this is coming from, as I haven't run into any blatant spam. Now there are some folks that post photos more than others, but I don't get the feeling they're being vain (the one exception being that oddball guy with the initials MV that I don't want to mention here because I don't want his name to get any search engine boosts but definitely fits into your ego complaint). If anything this is a fairly low traffic sub in terms of comments and submissions, and a large number of submissions include things like ""first attempt at street photography""; on these posts, unless a person is delusional, the laundry list of what to improve discussed the comments should pretty much deflate any notions of instant talent. If there are no comments (which happens often enough) it's pretty much an indicator of low interest due to it being extremely poor and not worth a critique, or it's just mediocre.   But I feel like one really needs to know how to read a photograph before putting in any of their input.    Possibly, but getting better at critiquing is similar to photography: you get better at it by doing it. Not only does it help the person you're critiquing, but it helps you to figure out and articulate what you like about something, why something works, and why it doesn't. This in turn helps you with your own photography, as you can more readily identify those things in your own work. You know all those ""great shot!"" comments people hate? That's a sign of someone not thinking critically about an image, and instead being fine with the superficial.  In a forum like this it's even more useful, because it allows for discussion about the critique itself. If person A has three things to say about an image, the OP can come back with reasons for their choices, clarifications on why things did or did not work with regards to person A's comments, and so on. When done openly (and not defensively), this can really help both sides learn a lot.   Can one really find a story just by looking at a profile of a head? Or is it just bullshit being passed off as 'being deep'? Do we really have to find stories in street photography? Can't we just see whether elements in a rectangle make the frame work aesthetically?   The story in street photography is similar to the rule of thirds: it's not necessary, but it throws the odds in your favor that your image will be stronger. When you know why an image works because of a narrative angle, you can toss it out, because you'll know why an image works without it. It's not that story is needed to make a great image, it's that a great street photography image lends itself to a great story. What's the story of someone stepping onto a curb? There's hardly one there, but capturing that moment increases the odds that there are all sorts of interesting things happening there in terms  of arms / legs / and body movement, facial expressions, eye gaze, etc, and is far more compelling than the same person standing there looking at their phone.    But keep in mind that narrative strength in an image can reach incredibly abstract and minimalistic levels. Take your example of elements in a rectangle: let's say there's a person sitting in a window, framed by a balcony, framed by an architectural element of the building, framed by the building itself. Having that person just sitting there is ok. Suddenly that person changes position and for a second curls up into a ball – now you have an image that can look like layers of oppression on a person. Or they stretch out and the image is now the exact opposite, or someone pushing against the barriers.  Now take the person out, and let's say the framing elements all fit into a perfect golden ratio. It's beautiful. It's a great photo. It's not street photography though, it's something else. Which is fine.  So yes, you can have elements that work great aesthetically with little to no story. Sometimes it's street photography, and sometimes it's not. It's just that, again, you're working with the odds here, and the odds of a great street photography image usually include more than just pleasing aesthetics.   Yeah, I sound bitter about it. And truthfully, I am. I love the genre, I deeply respect it, and to see it turn into basically another /r/analog - but only with photos of people's backs or a person walking in front of a wall/mural/public art.   Juxtapositions with static elements (walls / murals / public art) are the easiest things for people to get a handle on when they start out with street photography. This reason should be obvious – you can easily control a majority of an image with this method and wait for a great moment to enter the frame. Other forms of street photography are far harder to come by because you have to know how people and things move and communicate through a space and react with lightning fast reflexes to sudden opportunities. This can feel like straight up luck to someone just starting, when it's actually the exact opposite. So again, simply by the numbers, you're going to see a lot of street photography that has these kinds of setups.  However interestingly enough, that doesn't actually happen a lot in this sub, at least recently. I think you can count on one hand the number of single-element static juxtapositions that have shown up in the past month or so.  I don't think you're bitter – it sounds like you have concerns, though I don't really see the first one (lots of self promotion and out of control egos) and the second one (narrative in street photography or the requirement thereof) seems more like a difference of interpretation. Here's the thing – if you disagree with a critique about an image of someone's back or an image that people are being critical of but has aesthetics you appreciate, have you been pointing that out in critiques of your own that you've posted as comments on submission? I did exactly this in this post where I thought it was great and /u/Boosted03gti thought it wasn't street photography. No one died, no one's ego was irreparably damaged, and both views are out there for people to hash out further or consider the implications of in their heads.  I have a sneaking suspicion that this sub has a fairly large population that doesn't actually critique on anything. Whether that's because they're not comfortable with it (get over yourselves, criticism goes hand in hand with debating and you're not going to improve without doing it), or they feel like they're going against the grain (which should be MORE of a reason to engage in criticism), or whatever, the more voices there are, the better off everyone is."

Sometimes it's street photography, and sometimes it's not. It's just that, again, you're working with the odds here, and the odds of a great street photography image usually include more than just pleasing aesthetics.   Is it really though? According to your post it seems that you need a human element of some sort in the photo to make it street photography. I agree (to the extent) that your example of the window, balcony, etc. wouldn't really be a street photograph if the person was removed from the frame... But to me, that would be the equivalent of a poorly framed human element looking at their cellphone, taken on the street.   Take THIS example by Blake Andrews (any of his examples for that matter, especially his Circus Circus series). No human element, but would you consider it street photography? It's on the in-public website (that's not to say it should dictate whether you think its SP or not).   Juxtapositions with static elements (walls / murals / public art) are the easiest things for people to get a handle on when they start out with street photography. This reason should be obvious – you can easily control a majority of an image with this method and wait for a great moment to enter the frame. Other forms of street photography are far harder to come by because you have to know how people and things move and communicate through a space and react with lightning fast reflexes to sudden opportunities. This can feel like straight up luck to someone just starting, when it's actually the exact opposite. So again, simply by the numbers, you're going to see a lot of street photography that has these kinds of setups.   I agree with you here, especially your comment about those starting the genre. Although, if one may consider doing it more often it has to be presented in a way that should be on another level... I'm talking about a series of images, or a way that has to make it REALLY stand out from the rest, ESPECIALLY if it's some sort of mural/wall/public art piece that is considered a tourist go-to. Execution is key.   I don't think you're bitter – it sounds like you have concerns, though I don't really see the first one (lots of self promotion and out of control egos) and the second one (narrative in street photography or the requirement thereof) seems more like a difference of interpretation. Here's the thing – if you disagree with a critique about an image of someone's back or an image that people are being critical of but has aesthetics you appreciate, have you been pointing that out in critiques of your own that you've posted as comments on submission? I did exactly this in this post where I thought it was great and /u/Boosted03gti thought it wasn't street photography. No one died, no one's ego was irreparably damaged, and both views are out there for people to hash out further or consider the implications of in their heads.   I have in the past, on my old account which is deleted. If you dig through the older posts you might come across one or two. I did have a critique that arteryal disagreed with but nothing escalating after that. On this one, not so much. I only comment once on a rare occasion... After critiquing and having online arguments with strangers on the internet it sort of gets tiresome and just sitting back and being a bit apathetic is easier. Besides, DillonVFX and arteryal are the ones doing enough of a good job of that."
streetphotography,380ocs,lidocaineus,2,Tue Jun 2 15:32:04 2015 UTC,"My views on street photography are pretty fluid, but the one thing I keep going back to is a human element. The thing is, that doesn't necessarily include a person; it can be a humanistic idea, and be fairly existential. That particular Blake Andrews image is definitely SP in that vein. To me that's a shot of someone appreciating a bit of magical realism in something incredibly mundane (that might've been a bit redundant). In this case that someone is actually the photographer, lending itself to a whole meta-commentary discussion.   i definitely wish there were more commenters. When there are only a few views presented the sub ends up become very stratified and runs the risk of everything falling into an orthodoxy."

When done openly (and not defensively), this can really help both sides learn a lot.     This sounds great in theory but it doesn't work that way. OP drops an image and never comes back to comment/discuss OR they post argument after argument with ridiculous excuses for why their image isn't shit.     i definitely wish there were more commenters.

I can't quite figure out why he continues to post here to be honest.   To be honest, both you and /u/dillonvfx can come off as very combative. These are not always ""gentle"" comments. No, you do not owe anyone a sugar-coated critique and proper photographers know how to take criticism properly as well as debate its validity, or lack thereof. I also get that you're possibly tired of the current quality of work posted and it can be exhausting to explain something for what seems like the hundredth time, especially when the OP is ill equipped to further a critical discussion (as /u/illvin points out, this would hardly be the first sub that's devolved like this). But realize that there's possibly a chilling effect involved here that's filtered all but a handful of people out as well as the brainless who post banal ""Great shot!"" critiques.  Perhaps step back and let the sub run its course into a pile of mediocrity along the lines of a rotting flickr group? It's clear that despite your efforts you see it as heading towards a cesspool. If it is indeed headed towards an irrecoverable demise then these style of critiques haven't done anything to reverse that, and are just mentally tiring for you. The logical course of action then would be to cease critiquing (as you seem to indicate you've done, I haven't paid attention) and see if that changes anything. To put it another way: a fallow field period. Otherwise you see it as 100% doomed anyway.

You also have the two men in the background as a background layer, but it doesn't come together. 4 I liked because of the singular person pulled out of and away from the line of umbrellas in the background – here you had something in the front referencing something in the back. 5 is almost a snapshot, but you layered in the person behind. This is similar to #3 in that there's almost something there, but not quite; there's no connection between the two or you, and there's no story other than ""guy with braces has mouth open"".   Here's the thing. You're shooting at one of the busiest intersections in the world. You didn't take advantage of the setting as these could've been taken anywhere. You either need to isolate hard core but contextually include the environment, or layer like a madman. You also need to consider the images in terms of saying something narratively.   Bruce Gilden's been in the news lately because of his photo critiques on vice.com. Your stuff has echoes of his style. Anyone can take street portraits, but he pushed it to extremes to get narratives out of his images and into street photography territory. What's the story in your photos?"

You can push film by developing longer along with possibly other variables adjusted (more agitation, higher temps) so if you shot an underexposed image on ISO 400 film, you could push it in the darkroom to 800 ISO. The qualities of the film will change when you do this primarily in shadow detail (you lose it), but also grain, apparent contrast, dynamic range, etc. It's not the same as shooting with ISO 800 and developing at ISO 800."

The framing is obviously great with the father/daughter. I normally don't like it when people are looking down because they're more than likely looking at their phone, but here it works. The high key is great against the dark subjects. The beach and sky are different enough to be distinct but still maintain the high key. You avoided the temptation to really texturize the sand and turn it into an overprocessed 500px photo. The horizon line is a perfect eye magnet as the beach / sky separator and is enhanced with all the dark contrasting people dotted along it. Negative space is actually used well here.  The only thing that is slightly distracting is the right / upper right vignette. Possible alternate framing suggestion: position it so the two vertical pieces of the wood frame end on the horizon line so that the two subjects are fully in the sky. Not sure that would've improved anything, but something that would be interesting to compare against."

If your goal was to say how unpopular something is you're on the right track in that you should place a lot of space around a subject to isolate them. Figure out how to frame what's clearly a soccer fan with a ton of negative space around them, save for anything that would indicate he or she's a fan.   The reason yours doesn't work is because the way you shot it (like down the barrel of a gun), which compressed the field of view so everything looks like it's on top of one another and the sense of depth is flattened out. There are some empty chairs, sure, but it doesn't feel like a lot of empty chairs. Also out of focus main subjects are also a tricky technique to get right, usually used to indicate motion (blur) or something uncertain. You don't want that here; you want a rock solid identification of a soccer fan."

streetphotography,37ke62,OperaWinfrey,2,Thu May 28 12:00:28 2015 UTC,I like the image. The graininess gives it a dream like quality (shades of Ralph Gibson).  I'm not even sure if I would like the image any better if you fixed your horizon line.  It adds a bit of uneasiness that might be working in your favor.   I would have to see it cropped otherwise to know for sure but you would lose a lot of the kid in doing so. Then again if you had fresh developer this point would be moot.  The image also reminds me of some my old prints I was looking at not too long ago.  They were test prints experimenting with texture in the pre-photoshop days. One of the test prints I made was from a street photo I shot at the beach.

streetphotography,37bspb,hernytan,3,Tue May 26 13:49:10 2015 UTC,The walking in step is a very small read/detail to me. I wish it were more exaggerated.   Lets say they were both purposely trying to avoid stepping on certain lines or squares together that would have made for a stronger picture.  Also his large shoulder bag is distracting. It is taking attention away from the symmetry of their legs. I am totally fine with a image shot from behind if it has strong content or it's a pivotal point of view.  In this case it's just a familiar and safe point of view to me. It reminds me of following people walking to my gate at the airport.  It needs to be more exciting then this but it's out there so find it.

streetphotography,37763q,Frantic_Freddie,5,Mon May 25 12:59:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hardcore DOF stickler for street photography, but it's working against you here (garbage can notwithstanding). You want a feeling of isolation, which can come about from an empty street in focus. Instead you get a suffocating feeling from out of focus elements crowded around the guy, so much so that this feet aren't sharp. You would've also gotten a nice touch with the person in the upper right in the shadows.  Vignetting in the corners is a bit overdone. The sidewalk detail is suddenly 3-4 stops darker there for no real reason.  And yes, the photo is uninteresting as street photography because it's a homeless person doing nothing."
streetphotography,37763q,lidocaineus,1 point,Mon May 25 18:23:55 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback
streetphotography,37763q,haggertyjmn,5,Mon May 25 19:07:04 2015 UTC,It kinda depends on who you ask about what you did right or wrong and how they perceive what streetphotography means to them.  The tech weenies are going to say your whites are blown out next to your subject and it attracts the eye.  The content guys are going to cry foul for shooting a homeless person or LHF for short.  The street purist are shaking their heads for shooting with  low depth of field.  It's seen as cheating because you don't have to compose as carefully for background clutter. In this case the trash can would have become a issue if it was sharper.  I say it's a well composed photograph of a homeless person.  If you were shooting a reportage on this guy (day in the life) it would work well to fit the story.
streetphotography,3745g2,myfavoriteorganelle,1 point,Sun May 24 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"I'm VERY conflicted about this image. It basically sits at two extremes for me, contrasting two of my central pillars of my personal photography.   One. The subject and story it tells is brilliant. The sign and the couple to the bottom left, stunning. A perfect street shot, the kind that I strive for in my own work.   Secondly however, the actual photo is just flat an unappealing. Its hard to look at, not very pleasing to the eye due to the framing and just has no ""pop"" to me.   So I have these two things sitting in my head. Overall. Top pic mate. keep shooting!"
streetphotography,3745g2,SexistButterfly,2,Mon May 25 17:41:09 2015 UTC,"I've got no problems with the framing. Just a nice shot. Totally does it for me. The diagonal line running across the frame and running out of the frame in the bottom-right corner is brilliant (did you crop it that way, or was it shot as such?). Personally, I think you could back of on the contrast a little bit, but the pic itself is great."
streetphotography,3745g2,tijmendal,1 point,Mon May 25 18:40:14 2015 UTC,"The framing is fine, that was maybe a bad choice of words. I think the image itself is just very unappealing."
streetphotography,3745g2,SexistButterfly,1 point,Mon May 25 19:26:49 2015 UTC,Hey thanks.  I think I cropped a tiny bit to make the light come out right at the corner but the actual framing was pretty close.  I got lucky because I took it from a moving train and didn't really have time to frame it.  Didn't even notice what the sign said until after the fact.  Yea I'm worried that I might like contrast a lil too much.
streetphotography,3745g2,SexistButterfly,1 point,Mon May 25 21:46:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment.  I too had issues with the framing....I think mostly due to there being too much light space on the left.  Do you think a crop closer to the sign would help?

So it was more than anticlimactic to see a single car in an empty street... I'm sorry to say it, but there is just absolutely nothing of interest in the shot.  The fact that you state,   For street photographers, Portland is heaven.     Makes me even more disappointed.  I can't really suggest an area to improve except; do some research about street photography and work on seeking out interesting scenes/subjects."
streetphotography,372y6e,Nonchalant_Elephant,3,Sun May 24 11:46:50 2015 UTC,"I am here to learn, so thanks for your honesty :)  Allow me to explain my decision to title the photo ""intimate Portland"". I had opportunities to take street photography in other places in Portland with more people, but instead, I felt that a place like this is sort of the essense of backpacking (which is what I was doing at the time), i.e. visiting a spot where not many other tourists will visit, sort of a local and intimate experience with the city. The other reason, which I now realised is quite stupid, is that Mary's in the background is actually a strip club.  I fully understand where you're coming from, maybe I just took a strange liking to the photo because of the experience I had that lead to this photograph."
streetphotography,372y6e,Nonchalant_Elephant,4,Sun May 24 12:18:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking on the critique so well :)  Upon re-reading it, it seems pretty harsh.  I kinda got the relationship between the strip club and the ""intimate"", but it just wasn't what I expected and it wasn't clear enough in the photo - i.e. I had to read the caption to understand it.  I think you're definitely allowed to like photo's purely because of your experience surrounding it. You just have to be really self-critical when analysing if other people will understand the image as well as you do - sometimes you just have to accept that the image only holds value to yourself."

I agree to be honest, the whole staring at phones thing can sometimes be a hit or more often a miss but to be honest I didn't even see he was on his phone until post. I walked by the alley and saw him out of the corner of my eye, took a few steps back and snapped the picture. I do wish he was just walking up the alley without any distractions.  Can't argue with the left side of the picture, I should have darkened it.  The street I was shooting on was quite quiet then and I didn't have a way to get to a busier part of town so this was the best of the bunch."

streetphotography,36uyen,DillonVFX,1 point,Sat May 23 14:54:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input. I personally like the image because it shows the movement of the train coming in while the subject seems to have done this all before. Maybe I should have taken a picture like the one you linked instead.
streetphotography,36uyen,lidocaineus,6,Sat May 23 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"Well… yes. However what makes the fact that he's bored interesting? Putting it another way: if I was standing by him on the platform and I glanced over his way, why would I think ""oh, I didn't expect that""? I wouldn't, unless there were three other men standing beyond him in a line that were also looking at their phones in the exact same manner and looked eerily similar. That would've been compelling. Or if the screen of his phone was clearly visible and it said something incredibly abrupt like YOU WILL DIE yet he seems to be non-chalant about it. Or the train's blurring caught a reflection of him, someone in the train, or someone next to him in a fascinating manner.  Also why vertical? The top third shows nothing of interest, his legs are cut off at the knee, and the movement through the frame due to the blurring train is horizontal.  It's the start of a potential something, but it's not fully baked."

streetphotography,36slxv,DillonVFX,1 point,Fri May 22 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"i would love to see some of your shots.  please share your blog or flickr page if you have one. when you take people's photos, do you normally engage into some kind of conversation with them or do you simply move on? what camera settings do you use for this kind of photography?  do you use zone focusing and aperture priority mode or do you go fully manual?"
streetphotography,36slxv,p3t3or,4,Fri May 22 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, I don't have any interest in interacting with someone after I've got the shot I wanted. If they approach me I'll politely chat with them but it's not like I want to approach someone and say ""Hey I took a shot of you and your family because of of the way you were pointing your fingers"".  On a Leica M6 all the parameters of exposure have to be set manually so I've got no other choice. I also much prefer zone focusing over AF for street photography any day. Once you use a rangefinder with zone focusing and go back to using a DSLR the AF will really piss you off, it's just too fucking slow."

streetphotography,36uozv,KamyM,2,Fri May 22 07:23:54 2015 UTC,"50mm on a crop is a mild telephoto and you can really tell here; it feels very far removed from the subject. I get that you're trying to be meta about photographing what they're selfie-ing themselves into, but the mountains / water aren't interesting. If there was a volcano erupting or even someone photobombing them, that would be interesting, but even then it'd be better if you got closer (difficult with a 50mm + crop to frame right).  Technical: f/3.5 is a bit of an odd choice for this shot. With the adequate light, your distance, and the really terrible bokeh / out of focus characteristics on the Canon 50mm 1.8, it might've been a better choice to stop it all the way down to f/8.  Also the caption is… incomprehensible. I'm assuming this is the voice of the selfie subject, but it's difficult to parse. However that's separate from the photo itself."

streetphotography,36p0pc,DillonVFX,3,Thu May 21 03:18:28 2015 UTC,"Hands on hips, closing train crossing. Synchronicity of X's. Head tilted looking at oncoming train, doubled in glasses. Propeller of airplane forms more X's."
streetphotography,36p0pc,MightyHipsterHater,2,Thu May 21 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"The association with the train doesn't work because the viewer can't see the train coming. The depth of field is wrong for what you want to portray. Because it is so narrow, it puts emphasis on the person, hence Dillon's assumption that it's all about them. The background is too blurred out and flat to have any effective secondary subjects, hence why no one sees all these X's you point out. If you have to point it out, it doesn't work well."
streetphotography,36p0pc,Yewbert,1 point,Sat May 23 01:47:51 2015 UTC,I just liked the shot and made up the X's thingy. It's just a photograph after all.

streetphotography,36p0pc,arteryal,0,Thu May 21 20:08:58 2015 UTC,"I'm guilty of a few of those cliches at times too, but sometimes they just work and still make for fun/interesting photos. One of my all favorite shots I've taken is of a homeless man in Parkdale with heavyish b/w processing."
streetphotography,36p0pc,MightyHipsterHater,0,Thu May 21 20:15:22 2015 UTC,"Shoot what you like, how you like. That's a nice shot. Fun/interesting is the point of taking photos."
streetphotography,36ohao,BlueLu,2,Wed May 20 21:47:07 2015 UTC,"New to this, feedback wanted. I don't have much in the way of gear."
streetphotography,36ohao,Nonchalant_Elephant,1 point,Wed May 20 21:48:06 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about your gear. I started on a camera similar to yours. It gets the job done and they're great to learn on.  I really like the character you've found and the harsh orange lighting is cool. What I'd recommend is to set your lens at around the 24mm mark and then don't touch it! (except for focusing). This is a good focal length to start out on with a crop sensor. It's a medium wide so it forces you to get closer, but not to an extreme level.   So basically I think it would have been nicer to see this guy and his snowman up closer. Also, you can see he is about to stab in ol' Frosty's carrot nose - it might have been worth it to wait for the moment when the guy plunges the carrot in.  Keep shooting!"
streetphotography,36nnc8,boxjellyfishrule,3,Wed May 20 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"My two favs are the one with the man in glasses looking away from the camera, and this one. However, I think with the second one, it would be much better if you crop it vertically so it's just the guy leaning against the pole looking at the camera. He's looking at the camera, really looks like he's posing for the shot, has an interesting jacket. Lot of things going for him. With both men in the picture, I don't know who to focus on, which is a problem because the one guy is way more interesting than the other and is the one you want the viewer to look at. The shot of the two people on the bench is nice too.   The rest I just don't find particularly interesting. You did a good job isolating your subjects, though.   Also, I think your exposure/colors/contrast/etc are spot on in all of them. Well done on that."
streetphotography,36nnc8,schultzz88,3,Thu May 21 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"All I think when I see these photos are ""okay it's photos of people, so?"" You're photos don't have that ""oh wow that's an interesting character!"" or ""oh wow that's an interesting moment!"" feeling. The elements in your photos need to have much much stronger relationships. A higher % of the elements in your frames need to make someone think ""oh I see why they included those together because of the juxtaposition, contrast or colours.""  You need to pay way more attention to your backgrounds. You've got 3 people in this shot overlapping in a bad way.   This guy could potentially be an interesting character if only one could read his face more, if you really wanted to keep this shot for whatever reason having him framed within the red van would've helped.  This shot just has so much distracting clutter on the right side.   And I disagree with the other commenter, I actually think this shot is one of the weakest. What's so interesting about the back/side of his head? No interesting hair style or face tattoo that could only be captured from that angle.   Stop down your lens much more, the shallow DoF feels more like you're doing portraits or you're showing photos from the first time you walked around the street with a fast prime lens."
streetphotography,36nnc8,DillonVFX,2,Thu May 21 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. What I'm beginning to realize is that finding those moments of juxtaposition and relation between two or more different things are much more difficult to frame than I would have ever thought. But I guess that's just an issue resolved by shooting more.  On a different note, I submitted a few photos a couple weeks ago that you commented on.. Do you see any improvement between these and the previous lot? I feel like the more I shoot the more I'm learning about the work flow of street photography.   Thanks again for the comments"
streetphotography,36nnc8,SexistButterfly,2,Thu May 21 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"I wrote this as a reply to the top commenter here but so you can see it more easily I'll respond to you.   Approach street photography like a photo journalist, or even an architectural photographer. A picture of a person is just a person, and a picture of a building is just a building. Look for interesting things in the frame, unique characteristics and personality. Tell a story, which is something parroted on this sub A LOT. Its not that these pictures are bad, not at all, they're fantastic photos. They're just a little bit boring. Keep it up. Keep shooting and it'll come.  Cheers  Shameless plug and comment: http://imgur.com/a/Qylgw  Look at these two pictures I shot today. The first is alright. Its a good portrait, the guy is playing guitar, sweet. But the second picture says more about him. Maybe he's homeless. The crop shows more about him, it tells more of a story than just a picture of him. Neither image is anything to write home about to be honest, just thought I'd give an example of what I wrote above."

Users are getting banned for political reasons, which means that if they did happen to have something to contribute here, we won't be able to hear from them. Certainly, photojournalism and street photography have a lot of overlap, and I can conceivably see how a photojournalist or street photographer at the U of Toronto fire alarm event or the London G20 protest could have their submissions deleted or their account banned under the current situation.

streetphotography,36kp8w,arteryal,1 point,Wed May 20 14:42:27 2015 UTC,I quite like it. I don't think you need the vignette though. It doesn't add anything. In fact you are actually making the subject less obvious because now he is a little darker than before. An even exposure throughout the whole photo works best here I think.   This is a good photo because the composition is decent too. Too many street photography you see online completely ignore the composition despite having an interesting subject.   It would be an amazing photo if you have a little head in one of the windows at the top left of the photo.
streetphotography,36kp8w,ronseephotography,3,Wed May 20 04:42:50 2015 UTC,"This is a good photo because the composition is decent too.     I couldn't disagree more. The composition is neat and orderly but it also very poorly serves the image. Two things attract the eye in visual arts, bright areas and text. In this image we've got both and neither of them appear to be the intended subject of the image. The photographer seems to have invested a lot of effort into lining up the windows at the top of the frame and ignoring the unnecessarily tiny man.    One could put up a decent argument that this is architecture photography with an incidental human as opposed to the opposite.     Too many street photography you see online completely ignore the composition despite having an interesting subject.     Too many 'street photographers' focus so heavily on composition that they completely ignore the subject, which appears to be the case here."
streetphotography,36kp8w,arteryal,1 point,Wed May 20 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Contrast and a human figure attracts the eyes too. It's really clear what's the intended subject in this photo. I agree with the logo in the back. It's perhaps a little distracting but at this point you would have to photoshop it to get rid of it.   The man is not tiny at all I don't think. Not everything needs to be so obvious and up close. It's definitely clear enough that the man is the subject.   The effort into lining up the windows can simply be from cropping for all we know.   I really don't know about your last sentence. Have a look at photocritque, this sub or ITAP even. So many photos have such poor compositions."
streetphotography,36kp8w,p3t3or,1 point,Wed May 20 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"Not everything needs to be so obvious and up close.     I'm not suggesting that anything should be any way. However, when you make choices there are consequences. The consequence in this case is for the image to say to the viewer ""this element is insignificant"". This isn't my opinion and it has nothing to do with street photography, it's just a basic principle of visual arts.     It's definitely clear enough that the man is the subject.     Yes. That's why the image is a failure IMO. The photographer is saying 'here's the subject' while doing multiple things to draw the viewers attention away from him. This is the kind of rare street opportunity where there is potential interest and nothing is moving. A great photographer doesn't walk away from that scene until they've exhausted their ideas or things change.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhSaR5ckKZI     I really don't know about your last sentence. Have a look at photocritque, this sub or ITAP even. So many photos have such poor compositions.     Firstly, I have no interest in any other genres of photography, where composition may hold a much higher degrees of importance. Second thing is, just because so many poorly composed images exist, doesn't negate my view."

streetphotography,36hqpb,scyshc,2,Tue May 19 14:00:11 2015 UTC,"Technical: the low contrast isn't doing this photo any favors. It's like someone hit a visual mute on it.  Content: The background is busy but nothing's happening there. I keep going back and forth between that and the man wondering if there's some sort of connection. The light plastic bag in the lower right also keeps drawing my attention, because it feels like it could be the shoulder of a second person just out of frame. Basically I keep looking around for some sort of story or event or feeling and the only thing I can pull out is a bored man walking through an alley; everything feels very random and lacks any cohesive idea or theme.  I'm not sure if you're walking around a lot or planting yourself in certain areas and observing for awhile. When you're first starting out the latter is way easier in executing an interesting street shot since you get a feel for how things move and interact through a space, and this enables you to zero in on any compelling moments. The more you practice at this the better / faster you get at identifying interesting spots within an area, and you naturally end up more mobile as a result."

Street photography is already incredibly difficult in that you have no control of your subjects, backdrops, lighting or any other physical things. The only 2 decisions you can and need to make are, where to place your camera and when to press the shutter. It's upsetting enough to have shutter lag or focus hunting, why on earth you would relinquish all of that control is beyond me. It's not great, and it's certainly not clever or efficient."

streetphotography,36i3j4,hybridhybridhybrid,0,Fri May 29 08:01:59 2015 UTC,"This is really… bad.  Placing limitations on the creative process is often a very useful tool. However when the limitation is in direct opposition to what is a cornerstone of a genre (in this case, street photography's leanings towards consciously selecting a single, effective moment), you're running the risk of castrating yourself, and in this case you definitely did. Since you are no longer in control of what's being captured you're relying on luck to obtain a meaningful image. This makes the photos (as street photography) incredibly boring and uninteresting.  If you removed the qualification of 'street photography' from the series and presented it as something more along the lines of a narrative stream, there could be some value or interest in it, though starting the whole set with what's basically a posed selfie is extremely self-indulgent."
streetphotography,36i3j4,lidocaineus,1 point,Wed May 20 01:02:13 2015 UTC,Sure I agree that it's not street photography in the classic sense but I think it's still interesting from a narrative perspective as you noted. I think it's a good exercise to push the boundary of what exactly is a framed photograph. If an automated picture taking device takes an extraordinary street photo is it any less extraordinary?  Also the first selfie is to just show what the device looks like. :)

You have 2 options I believe.  Message the reddit admins somehow and ask to have your account un banned by them. (I'm not sure how this works, so you'll have to google it).

The grinning dude in the foreground is really distracting.  You're (intended?) use of layers in the photograph works well. The woman holding the loop and the man holding onto the ceiling bar work nicely. You could maybe try cropping it square and use the right part of the image, cutting the left part out. That might work.  The processing is nice. Very soft and not overdone. Often street-photographers have a tendency to go for the 'tri-x pushed 2 stops' look (eg. a lot of contrast and grain).

streetphotography,368l5i,mypoorpoems,2,Sun May 17 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"I feel so disconnected from the scene because of how far it is. The whole right side of the frame just doesn't work at all, I can see that if you pointed to the left you'll have someone in the foreground on the left that's just as distracting/pointless but that's why you're supposed to physically move yourself and work the scene."

The subject is pretty boring, we're not close enough to the subject to really get anything from it, the composition, well, there isn't really anything composition, just a subject wonkily slapped in the middle of the frame. There is absolutely no engagement with the subject at all, and, to be honest, so what that a Vietnamese boy also plays games?   There is nothing going on around the subject of any interest and nothing to lead our eye to the subject. On the right hand side the is some object that is distracting and impossible to make out due to poor composition.   Well, each to their own I suppose."

streetphotography,35o96u,vortexbits,5,Tue May 12 04:03:22 2015 UTC,I find the right third of the pic makes it. Unique railing and lines that pull your eye into the train which then pulls your eye across the canvas. Having the people facing away reduces distraction of the composition. I think it's excellent.
streetphotography,35o96u,decorama,5,Tue May 12 12:10:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this entirely. The blurred movement of the people and bus made me feel like it was a still from a time-lapse where he is static. Like he is watching life fly by. I REALLY like this picture. The railing creates excellent depth AND acts as a leading line to the subject, again this is in the right 3rd. I also like that the people are moving AWAY from me. It adds to the feeling that time is getting away from you.  I can't find anything I don't like here, and for me, that is rare.  EDIT: I found something I don't like. Your website is horrid to navigate. It needs work."

I recently moved to Squarespace looking for a more minimalist approach; however it came with several hiccups like losing all of my prior posts from my Wordpress site. So I decided to start fresh with the site dividing it into two segments: Gallery and Blog. The blog is updated regularly with images that depict what I experience and the gallery is destined for my most favorite work. Please, when you get a chance, tell me what you didn't like. Problem is I don't know how to code and I am highly dependent on the templates. Any tips will be appreciated. Cheers, MightyHipsterHater!

There is never more than 2-3 layers at most, yet you can still go straight to any single image. Your website is good in that it is simple and only has two layers, but there is a total lack of navigation on the second layer. This is partially my taste, but I find a lot of people agree (particularly those in web-design) that it's nice to be able to skip through an album and look at the picture which peak your interest, rather than having to sift through ""next"" and previous"" without knowing what is next and how many images there are in total. Gallery in particular, should have a very flat or flowing design to it, as that is what is expected from the title. It's not that big of a deal how the images are organised, only that there is some kind of quick scroll or list / page of icons."

Jumping around like apes with fire ants up their butts telling people their pictures are trash, yet not only do they have no awards or career success, they have no images of their own   Quoted from you. Just wondering, can I see the list of awards you've won?"
streetphotography,35o96u,MightyHipsterHater,2,Wed May 13 07:16:19 2015 UTC,"Way to cherry pick my comments from entirely different subreddits and use them out of context. I have no awards. I'm more than happy to admit that. My work is not yet good enough to enter competitions worth entering. Someday it will be. You see, my quote doesn't apply here. Why? Because when I critique something, I provide reasoning and supporting evidence for my OPINION. The technical aspects I am analysing are learned from professionals. Also, in the thread you have picked that quote from, I actually provided a university lecture where some of the related knowledge comes from. Yes, I even provided an academic reference, which you have so conveniently left out.  What I also don't understand (and probably anyone else reading this because it's so obvious) is that you replied to a comment where I am telling someone I like their picture and why I like it. Not to mention I at least have the guts to publicly display my pictures. Yet you try to quote me as a hypocrite using a quote I made about people who do something I haven't done here? I guess I must have hurt your feelings in the past or something because you are butt-hurt to the point of blatant stupidity.  EDIT: Oh I have sold some images though, so I guess that counts for something /shrug"

Should I mention every time someone gave you negative critique, you self-destructed and went through their profile to cherry pick pictures and give them the type of critique that you're against?  Also, your critique is solely focused on TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE IMAGE, something a beginner does. The same goes for B&H videos of ""academic reference."" That shit is meant for a photographer to develop an eye for composition, then move on to capturing moments. You're far too stuck on the technical aspects of an image. You always disregard content in exchange of form, and this goes straight to your own images too.  And besides that, why am I not qualified to give critique if I haven't ""won any awards,"" when my situation is that I haven't ENTERED any competitions?   Not to mention I at least have the guts to publicly display my pictures   Err, you went through my Flickr profile to give shitty critique. Isn't that publicly displaying my pictures?   Because when I critique something, I provide reasoning and supporting evidence for my OPINION   From my critique of your image: ""The entire right side of the frame is empty space that doesn't add to the image. It's distracting to the subject, who is a person walking with an umbrella. Sure, the** facial expression is mildly interesting** (it looks like she's in a hurry), but other than that, there's nothing amazing going on.""

It wasn't. I was referring in that quote to OTHER USERS. I actually LIKE some of your pictures. You knew my website. I know you are a highly active user. I consciously linked to my website adn it's not the first time I have since my account change. Clearly I am not trying to hide anything from anyone. I mean, I have enough intelligence to use a keyboard so surely I could predict you would realise I am the same person.....  I mean for Christ sake, OP THANKED me for the feedback, and has already made changes to their website. The blog section flows much better now and we can peruse their work with ease.  I am also confused as to how you think I ONLY think technically? I very clearly described how this picture made me FEEL. I know you don't like my pictures, but the most common response I get from most of them is how they make people FEEL. Obviously there is nothing in any of them which connect with you. Moments and moods are a subjective aspect that affect every viewer differently. Technical aspects affect nearly ALL viewers subconsciously. I am willing to change my opinion when you say things, but PLEASE for the love of god give me some kind of reference or some reason to believe that you are at the very least, more qualified than me. I'm dead serious. I will eat everything I have ever said and change my entire outlook, if you can simply give me some form of credible evidence or support to your claims. THAT is what that quote from another thread was about.  I don't like you. You don't like me.  This has already been established. The difference is that I have cleared the slate and left you alone, while you seem to really enjoy spending your time attacking me. Yes I did over-react in that past event. I still hold the same opinion, but I should not have let it go rather than blow up at you. Unfortunately I am human, and I have bad days or weeks just like everyone else.  So we have three options here. 1. Keep randomly swooping in from places and using out of context quotes and opinions to bag each other out. 2. Wipe the slate, admit our mistakes, agree to disagree and simply avoid heated or offensive debates. 3. Hell I'll even go as far as to try and be your FRIEND if you want?  You're call, but please if you want number 1 I'd rather you just leave me alone and I'll leave you alone as I have been as of late."

Both making and experiencing art are highly subjective... it just is. I hope you don't disagree there.    Given that, what kind of 'evidence' do you want? and what could that possibly achieve? You could both find someone to back your views, then what? so let's forget you and him for a second, it's trivial to find quotes from masters who oppose each others views. It's a fools errand to pursue that kind of debate.    There are many people here who are speaking from years of experience of not just shooting experience but looking at and learning from others work. That does not make their opinion better than yours, let's be perfectly clear about that; it makes their opinion more refined and obviously based on their own life experience. It's virtually impossible to condense and articulate the difference of experience between two people without getting into lengthy philosophical discussions.    You can either trust me on this or dismiss it as bullshit, entirely up to you but if you study photography, your views will be quite different in a couple of years. This isn't something that anyone is going to learn and know anything about in a few months or even a few years. Winogrand said at one point, after having photographed like a lunatic for 25 odd years, ""I'm just trying to learn about photography, that's all"". I think we can all take something away from that."
streetphotography,35mmm2,xensin,1 point,Mon May 11 19:21:03 2015 UTC,"For the most part using a long lens especially a telephoto isn't suitable for street photography. Same with having a shallow DoF. I don't find the moment quite interesting enough or well captured enough. One should always strive to have viewers at least partially think ""Wow I haven't seen it captured like that before"". Especially when it's a moment that's not unusual to see in day to day life. How would I improve it? Find a more interesting scene & background and only upload that photo."

streetphotography,35lqz3,scenesofnewyorkcity,2,Mon May 11 15:23:10 2015 UTC,What I always like about your photos is how you've got layers in them and I don't mean layers of distracting clutter that is very commonly posted here.  It always annoys me when I get photos like this of a large group of people looking at something off screen there's always a few that look right into your camera and break the illusion of being a fly on the wall.
streetphotography,35lqz3,DillonVFX,2,Tue May 12 01:44:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I do my best to get up close to chaos and then organize the chaos, which does yield some nice layers sometimes.   I do not like photos where the main subject is looking in to the camera for the same reason as you. However, I think a subject looking straight in to the camera with layers of interesting content behind them can work very well. I think it adds some depth and allows the eyes to really travel through the image"

Will you get confronted over taking photos? Maybe, you're rolling the dice every time but chances are low that it'll happen. I've been confronted quite a few times while shooting in Sydney and a few of the times the person has gotten physical but I also know plenty of street photographers in the same city that have been shooting much longer than me or just as long and they haven't had any problems.   Also once you get enough (good) photos you can carry them around with you so if someone gets pissed off you can show that you're not looking to mock them or do anything sinister with the photos."

You can not take responsibility for how someone perceives your activity."
streetphotography,35h9pg,arteryal,3,Sun May 10 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"First off, I seriously appreciate this thought. Thank you. Secondly, while it isn't my business whatever people think about what I do, as a person, I am responsible for my actions in regards to other people. If I frightened or offended someone by taking their picture, it's on me, and I would feel the need to apologize. That being said, involving people in art is what it's all about, so I'm still ambivalent I guess."
streetphotography,35h9pg,rstthedave,3,Mon May 11 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"There's a fine line I suppose. Yes, absolutely, you must take responsibility for your actions, but what is that exactly? you pressed a button and captured some light, so what? It's one thing to be responsible for your actions and another thing all together to be responsible for someone else's interpretation or (mis)understanding of your actions.    If someone is frightened, offended or upset by a photograph, then sure, there's nothing wrong with having that discussion about it and I open myself up to it every time I press the shutter, as should all photographers (IMO).    I'm not disagreeing with you in any way and completely understand where you're coming from. The issue isn't quite as simple as I make it out to be and I have no doubt that all street photographers struggle with that question in one way or another."
streetphotography,35h9pg,arteryal,3,Mon May 11 00:34:56 2015 UTC,Try using a practice crowd to break the ice.  Find areas where there is going to be a large gathering of people like a protest. Folks in these types of setting expect to be photographed.  This will help you get comfortable shooting people up front and in close.  Then transition it into your street photography. Act confident and purposeful.....  http://i.imgur.com/HWzcoAR.jpg
streetphotography,35h9pg,haggertyjmn,2,Sun May 10 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"It comes gradually over time. There's no way someone can pick up street photography and instantly shoot from the front and close.  Keep practicing, shooting, and closing the gap. What you quickly realise is  A: people don't give a shit so long as you don't act creepy  B: you've found a technique to hide the fact that you shot a pic of them. Fiddle with camera settings right after, lower the camera while looking at something behind the subject etc."

streetphotography,35h9pg,scenesofnewyorkcity,2,Sun May 10 13:42:39 2015 UTC,"You're in London, so there must be at least several areas that are extremely crowded with people. Try going to a place where it is packed shoulder to shoulder, and it should be very easy to just bump through the crowd with your camera up, shooting faces from very close.  This will probably help you get more comfortable, so you can start doing it in less crowded areas. Just be very quick and don't make eye contact ever. Look past them before and after photo as if you are intently focused on some point in the distance."
streetphotography,35h9pg,tclayson,2,Sun May 10 14:37:38 2015 UTC,"Choose your moments and make sure you get the shot first time, don't faff about, most people won't mind you taking the first photo, but turning them into an ad-hoc model might be pushing it a bit too far.   Try not to make eye contact. Even if it's really obvious you're taking a picture of them. Once you make eye contact you open the door for people to protest, plus you let them know your intentions. Take the photo, if they're watching you give them a little smile after the photo if you want it's just a sign of thanks.   Ignore their reactions. 99% of subjects will either ignore you or acknowledge you, some in an aggressive way. No matter what, just keep in mind that they won't remember you in 5 minutes time.   And hey, what is the worst that can happen? If someone really takes offence and approaches you then you can say ""I'm awfully sorry, this is just my hobby."" And offer to delete the photo. Big smiles and no arguing.   I said at the start ""choose your moments"". People by themselves are perfect, the worst you'll get is some uncomfortable looks. But pointing your camera at a biker gang unsolicited? Probably not a good idea.   Lastly, if you're unsure then just ask. If you're photographing market stalls, or Street performers then you can either go up and ask or just point towards your camera with a shrug and they'll give you a nod. Similarly with tramps/homeless give them a fiver or something and ask if they wouldn't mind you taking a few shots.  It gets easier over time. The more confident you appear the less uncomfortable you will make other people. Pretend you're a journalist and this is your job or something until it feels right."

I've made a couple of crops (I hope you don't mind) with different effects:  1) More sky gives the impression of a man meditating trying to transcend his dismal surroundings, while keeping the man dimuitive http://i.imgur.com/zfvGcvg.jpg  2) Quite a wide and busy crop shows a sad man trapped in his environment (plays well with the fenced/caged-in look http://i.imgur.com/0k5zlnz.jpg  PS I'm a total noob so don't take what I'm saying too seriously"

streetphotography,35fy74,miATC,1 point,Sun May 10 07:48:40 2015 UTC,I like the composition and the idea to use the fence. My only issue is that the fence contrasts with the road too much and keeps drawing my eye there instead of the guy.

streetphotography,35fy74,UrbanLithograph,1 point,Sun May 10 05:54:49 2015 UTC,"What is the fence contributing?   This is a melancholy image depicting a lonely/solemn looking man in a run down area and I really think it works.  That's what it is.. it's not a picture of a fence. The fence just looks like it's there because you thought it might be cool. Ask yourself why you do what you do. We're not supposed to be just pointing our cameras at cool things and hoping to get lucky, there is some intent and then execution.  It also distracts the eye quite a bit, and detracts from the feeling of him being all alone because he isn't surrounded by as much emptiness visually."
streetphotography,35fy74,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Sun May 10 14:50:09 2015 UTC,Thank you all for your critiques and comments.  Regarding the fence i wanted it in there because I had a shot in mind and tried to execute it as best as I could in the time frame I had. I didn't know how long he was going to sit there.
streetphotography,35dvzs,HU57L3R,2,Sat May 9 11:18:51 2015 UTC,"I think you should've straightened this photo, it feels very accidental unlike if the tilt was more extreme to suggest the person is high tired and disoriented. A crop could've also helped. Too bad the background is full of distracting advertising.   Keep your eye out in the future for situations like this because it could be executed much better like for example if you had been on the same set of escalators as him and taken the photo while standing in front of them up close."

streetphotography,35eedy,felixmiddendorf,1 point,Sat May 9 15:12:28 2015 UTC,"Bad idea to reference more famous works of art in your titles because it just makes the process of dismissing your photo for not being as good as the ""original"" that much quicker.   The most interesting thing in this shot to me would've been the hands so I would've gotten right up behind them and taken a really close shot that would've filled the frame up of their hands. It's still not really a shot worth publishing because the content of the frame isn't interesting enough."
streetphotography,35dmi2,bencfay,4,Sat May 9 08:21:07 2015 UTC,The content of the photo isn't interesting and I don't see the connection/juxtaposition that your title implies.

streetphotography,356nu0,scenesofnewyorkcity,3,Thu May 7 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"The grain's a matter of taste really, but you could definitely afford to shoot at a lower ISO than 8000. The picture was taken at f8.0 at 1/320 so you've got scope to open up the aperture or increase the shutter speed to let more light in, so you're not needing to use such a high ISO value. Like I said, if you like that amount of grain then that's what matters, but if you don't then next time you've got scope to get the light in another way."
streetphotography,356nu0,Fulbee,1 point,Thu May 7 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"Nice capture. Not too grainy. Embrace the grain. I like the juxa of the couple and the loner passed out in the back. The couple in the shadow and the loner brightly lit. Comp wise, maybe if you kneeled down just but to tighten things but that's just a nit pick."

streetphotography,356nu0,squilliam132457,1 point,Thu May 7 23:00:05 2015 UTC,To me it looks pretty bad on the blacks in particular. How does it look in black  and white? I don't think color brings a lot to the image.

streetphotography,354myk,BenjaminReilly,3,Thu May 7 01:49:47 2015 UTC,I like this shot a lot! The way the light pole divides the sunlit wall and the shadows is very interesting. Not sure how I feel about the position of the man though.
streetphotography,354myk,HeyHiHelloHowdy,1 point,Thu May 7 03:17:36 2015 UTC,I can see why the argument for having the man just before or after the light pole. The shot I got w/ him before the pole looked awkward because his stride wasn't opened up.   I've grown to like the anonymity of his position after looking back. The fact you can't see his face appeals to me for some reason
streetphotography,354myk,EarlChop,2,Thu May 7 03:51:03 2015 UTC,It would have been brilliant if you couldn't see any part of him on the right side of the pole. With the change of light it would look as if he were walking through a portal or something.  Still a great shot.
streetphotography,354myk,VeinyPickle,1 point,Thu May 7 04:08:40 2015 UTC,Oh yea that wouldve been great. And slightly trippy haha
streetphotography,354myk,Boosted03gti,1 point,Thu May 7 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"Very clever image. I love how the light bulb on the right is ""lighting up"" that area, too.  I would suggest you revisit the location and compose the shot so that the light pole sits on either the left or right third of the image, and maybe play around more with the positioning of the people.  Still one of the better images I've seen on this subreddit in a month."
streetphotography,354myk,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Thu May 7 06:00:47 2015 UTC,"Still one of the better images I've seen on this subreddit in a month.   Thanks!   I would suggest you revisit the location and compose the shot so that the light pole sits on either the left or right third of the image, and maybe play around more with the positioning of the people.   I've been trying to come back but the sun's path has changed so much since the seasons have switched and its been tough to get the timing right.   In hindsight I wish I wouldve waited at the location for longer that 15 minutes. I played with the crop to get the pole on the 2/3's vertical but then it cut off the top of the light pole and the building facade.   I'll keep revisiting the location though since its pretty close to my apartment. Cheers!"
streetphotography,3555g4,veedubbin,2,Thu May 7 04:45:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say heavy edits is frowned upon, but generally you shoot with a higher f/stop in this genre. The reason being that you want to put your subject in the context of the frame, say the background. By shooting with heavy bokeh, you lose context and background, which this genre isn't entirely about.  If you want to shoot on the street with heavy bokeh, look at urban photography."
streetphotography,3555g4,VeinyPickle,1 point,Thu May 7 07:27:16 2015 UTC,I would also add that traditionally street photographers used focal lengths less than 50mm to get the surrounding environment in the image. This alone yields a deeper depth of field because wide angle lenses like 35mm and 28mm just have that depth of field.
streetphotography,3555g4,OpticalPrime,1 point,Thu May 7 16:04:03 2015 UTC,"Are heavy edits generally frowned upon? Also, after browsing a few pages I see few shots with heavy bokeh. Are larger depths of field considered ""true"" street photography?  Edit: Added two shots of what my usual work looks like. 1 2"
streetphotography,3555g4,walaska,1 point,Thu May 7 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"Hi! I really like that style. Is it just very heavy noise reduction? How do you get it looking so smooth, if you don't mind me asking?"
streetphotography,3555g4,walaska,1 point,Thu May 7 13:07:11 2015 UTC,Unfortunately yes it is heavy noise reduction. The subjects were heavily back lit. Brought down the highlights and then brought the shadows up which resulted in a lot of noise =[
streetphotography,3513wd,EarlChop,2,Wed May 6 05:54:50 2015 UTC,I like the angles and the lines in this pic. The angle of the ground sloping away and the brickwork they're sitting on with the line of the top of the hedge behind them.
streetphotography,3513wd,MilesMango,1 point,Wed May 6 05:55:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, the lines in this image are strong and satisfyingly parallel. The only thing I could see that would improve it would be to have less foreground in the shot. I get that it gives the people a smaller scale relative to the rest of the frame, but all that empty space in the bottom of the frame along with a busy top of the frame detracts from it a little.   Overall I like it, nice work :)"
streetphotography,3513wd,infinitecrest,1 point,Wed May 6 12:51:14 2015 UTC,The way the ground shifts makes this unassuming picture strangely intriguing.  Thanks for posting it.
streetphotography,3513wd,richmahogany_,1 point,Wed May 6 17:07:28 2015 UTC,I agree I like the hard shift in concrete that creates a wave effect. You say you like the lines and angles. There's not much in terms for color here and the contrasts could play to your favor in B&W.

streetphotography,34zlr7,Encre_Ink,1 point,Wed May 6 02:54:03 2015 UTC,"I really like a few of these. Composition and aesthetic is obviously really important to you (and to alex webb, ha), and sometimes that results in taking pretty pictures with no content. I'm not really a fan of the pictures with no content, and I don't think you need to keep them around considering that you were able to capture both composition and content a few times. Those few times could perhaps set the standard you don't want to dip below.  How was the workshop? Did it really make you improve for any other reason than simply hanging out with like minded people? I really doubt that any master is gonna spell out some golden key secret that makes you better, but the experience of hanging with other SP's and just being immersed in it prob would yield improvements."
streetphotography,34zwdz,thegianttaco,5,Tue May 5 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Hey man, great that you got started and are starting to feel out your comfort zone! It's not like you have to shoot strangers on the street - there are different preferences for different photographers. You might consider going all color or all B&W though since the limited color thing can come off as a little cheesy, but everyone has their own aesthetic preferences.  Anyway, just keep shooting!"

streetphotography,34zwdz,VeinyPickle,1 point,Wed May 6 14:50:44 2015 UTC,"I've been playing around due to boredom with flash and up-close shooting. I get the occasional confrontation or yelling, but for the most part, they have somewhere to be so they have no time to stand around telling you to delete the photo.  Even then, hold your ground. You're not doing anything illegal by shooting in a public area."
streetphotography,34zwdz,Rirere,2,Wed May 6 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"Selective color is hard to pull off without being tacky.  Not saying it can't be done, but I once heard a good quote about it.  Paraphrased, the gist was that it's often used to draw attention to something that's not the subject (else it should stand out by its form), so what's the point?  Looking at the linked photo, that's my immediate reaction.  If you've chosen to color that one object and hence draw attention, why does the viewer care?  It doesn't really seem to have a relationship to the road sign, and if it there isn't really a tie-in, why not have that in-focus instead?  Street stuff can definitely be hard and once you get past your initial fears, it's easy to wind up with a pile of pictures of people.  We take those pictures because we find something fascinating about the little slices of daily life, but unless that's communicated by relationships within/without the frame, it's just a picture of a person.  Best of luck in the future!  Shooting crowds isn't a bad way to start if it's the individual factor that puts you on edge."

streetphotography,350gi6,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Wed May 6 04:59:32 2015 UTC,Thanks :) What I have done is separate these images from my main photography website as I believed they were most in tune with what was considered street here. Seemingly I filtered them pretty well. My intention was to posts some over the coming weeks for critique if I felt like it.

streetphotography,34znbu,DillonVFX,6,Tue May 5 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"Well it's kind of dark overall so there is no sense of depth. Two people obviously don't want their picture taken. What exactly was it that you wanted to communicate with this picture? Obviously the man in the front is the subject, but I don't find him that interesting. I do kind of like that dark shading caused by his hand. That's cool."
streetphotography,34znbu,MightyHipsterHater,-1,Wed May 6 01:15:07 2015 UTC,Actually everyone in the photo is blocking the sun from hitting their eyes not my lens. What's the subject? Well the act of the 3 blocking the sun and also one of the guys that used a bag lifted up high to do it that also happened to get a shadow from the man in front casted on it.   Edit: why would it matter anyway if the people didn't want their photo taken?
streetphotography,34znbu,johnny5ive,1 point,Wed May 6 03:13:56 2015 UTC,"I like the face blocking and the outline of the man's head on the bag behind him.  The only thing that irks me a little is you shadow on the woman, it's a little distracting.  Other than that, great shot.  Edit: Also, your blacks and whites are perfect in this editing.  I have trouble getting my levels to please me but this pic has them just right."
streetphotography,34y1vu,horschdl,3,Tue May 5 14:43:04 2015 UTC,I don't think there's a strong enough connection between the man in this photo and the art on the wall. The photo also appears to be posed (and before anyone replies to me I can't be fucked getting into another debate about the definition of street photography). Take a look at the photo on the right side page as an example of how it can be done better.
streetphotography,34y1vu,DillonVFX,0,Tue May 5 22:01:45 2015 UTC,Can you define for me why posed photography isn't street. Lol. Just joking.
streetphotography,34y1vu,TheGhostOfElFryo,-2,Tue May 5 23:38:49 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you on this one. It kind of just looks like the average picture my parents would bring home from a weekend trip. No juxtaposition, nothing that compelling or interesting on it's own. Not especially complex or well composed."

streetphotography,34vw62,dinosawrsareawesome,3,Tue May 5 00:11:39 2015 UTC,"I like what you tried to do, the obvious crop just kinda kills it for me. It looks so unnatural and too symmetric. Can we see the whole shot? I mean, in my opinion the shapes of the man and the cone and the corresponding colors are great, it's a very subjective thing but I think the idea behind why this shot could work holds up simply on the aesthetic value alone. The problem is whether or not there's enough context, and the shallow DOF doesn't help. The processing is fine in this case, I think it fits the photo nicely."
streetphotography,34vw62,mj1176,1 point,Tue May 5 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"I've been meaning to get back to you all day, computer problems are restricting when I can edit.

I'm increasingly happy with the colour and unhappy with the crop."

streetphotography,34vw62,meetbaxter,2,Tue May 5 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"I agree on the comment on the crop. Feels oddly tight. Generally a lot of street photography is shot in landscape format, it feels closer to the way our eyes take in the world. That's not to say rules aren't meant to be broken, but usually you would do so with specific purpose. I feel like a landscape would work better.   Good for you on giving street photography a crack though. It's a slippery slope... If you stick with it it will start to consume your thoughts!"
streetphotography,34vw62,iansarrad,1 point,Tue May 5 08:09:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I shoot a mix of portrait and landscape in my normal work, but weighted towards landscape, I've never thought of why, you raise an interesting point.   I will endeavour with the street photography, I've started taking a dslr everywhere, it's a nice distraction in a city with so much rain.  Edit: one of the core problems is I agree with the comment on the crop!"
streetphotography,34wfva,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Tue May 5 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"There are some distracting elements here that I think prevent it from feeling complete and well-executed. I like the subject matter; the construction workers and random bystanders seem to be intently interested in this guy and I want to know more, but we can't see much of him and a huge chunk of the frame is full of the woman and her baby, who only really distract from the scene -- they don't seem to be paying attention to it at all. The chunk of someone's back in the bottom left of the frame and the other cut-off subjects in the frame are a bit distracting too, as is the car in the background. I know hindsight is 20/20, but if it where me I'd have tried to get on the other side where the car is and get more of the sitting man's face, and try to eliminate some of the unnecessary elements from the composition."
streetphotography,34wfva,mj1176,1 point,Tue May 5 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"I actually like the inclusion of the mother and child, I feel like it lifts the composition a lot and adds to some confusion. It's hard to say, but I feel like working it from the other angle wouldn't have necessarily lifted it much. I could be wrong though, you only ever know it in the moment.  It's nice, but I've had a look through your Flickr stream and feel like you have some stuff that is much more compelling than this."
streetphotography,34wfva,meetbaxter,1 point,Tue May 5 08:13:49 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice. Lots of people filling the frame, little overlap, and an middle ground focal point--the mom and baby in front create pictorial distance; I want to go into the picture to see what's happening with the guy on the ground. I don't mind not seeing his face; I think it makes the shot more intriguing.   It would be better if the cab weren't there, but the cab doesn't kill the shot. Maybe I'd just wait a moment to see if it'd leave.  I don't like the clothes in the bottom left corner, but you can't crop them without cropping the guy in the background, too."
streetphotography,34wfva,iansarrad,1 point,Tue May 5 10:06:14 2015 UTC,"yes as a couple of you said, mom/baby is intentional. iansarrad described it as ""pictorial distance"" which i've never heard of, but it sums it up well.  the idea is it lets your eyes find the puzzling scene as a secondary discovery, because the baby will get your attention at first. and because your eyes land on the scene as a secondary thing, i feel it does add more confusion/romance/whatever.   ya some overlap etc, execution not ideal, thx for feedback"

Again, it's well possible I've fucked up the whole post-processing, it's not convincing for me either and I wonder if that's just a question of composition or tones or if there's anything that could alleviate this."
streetphotography,34tuqu,iansarrad,2,Mon May 4 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"I think context is useful as long as it doesn't distract. If you could establish context with other pairs of wine drinkers, the sign of the cafe, or some empty tables, it would be better because those elements would reiterate the subject rather than dilute it."
streetphotography,34tuqu,iansarrad,1 point,Mon May 4 15:48:50 2015 UTC,"Good point, thanks for hint."
streetphotography,34tuqu,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 15:53:30 2015 UTC,"took another shot at it, changed the crop and reduced the contrast. The original photo is very contrasty as it was taken against the sun, hard to get anything better, it was worth the effort."
streetphotography,34tuqu,mj1176,2,Mon May 4 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Here's my attempt  I changed the crop to 1:1 to isolate the subjects. Depending on your aesthetic, you could  also try a shallow DOF to isolate the subjects more. If your lens were fast enough you could get bokeh in the red parts to eliminate the problem of the overlapping figures and the table in the foreground."
streetphotography,34tuqu,mj1176,1 point,Tue May 5 03:35:25 2015 UTC,"well yeah, that would work. Thanks"
streetphotography,34tuqu,mj1176,2,Tue May 5 09:37:16 2015 UTC,"What do you like about the shot and what about it are you looking for critique on? It's dark, doesn't particularly draw my eye anywhere... This strikes me as one of those ""old men are interesting so here's some old men doing stuff"" kinda shots. I think everyone has those early on, but if it were me I probably wouldn't keep this one. Maybe if the processing were a little less contrasty and there was more detail in the shadows there could be a bit more interest, but as it is I don't think this one stands on its own."

It's not about ""old men"", rather more about documenting traditions and costumes of a particular area.  My main concern here is infact the overall tone, I've cropped it and pushed in post-processing the contrast hoping to gain a bit more as there's a lot of detail that could draw your attention away. Really unsure about the results as you can see."

You won't be there to explain this every time someone sees the photo; it has to be able to stand on its own and it doesn't in this case. Also, be careful about producing such culture-specific work unless it's part of a set or project that's specifically about that culture. If this is just supposed to be ""good"" street photography that anyone can appreciate, how is anyone who's not Italian and familiar with the area supposed to get the meaning you described?"
streetphotography,34qylv,jerelcons,1 point,Sun May 3 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"Not bad. The staggered pairs and the patterns behind them are great conceptually. I can see it working a little better if you had caught the arrangement a bit earlier, and maybe didn't crop so much. I'd consider maybe converting it to black and white; the color doesn't really contribute anything IMO and it would emphasize the contrasting patterns in the background more. It's nothing spectacular as a stand-alone shot, but I think it would have value as part of a set of similarly themed photos focused on patterns of textures and arrangements of subjects."
streetphotography,34qylv,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 14:06:11 2015 UTC,Good try. I don't mind the colors. They don't take away anything. But too far and seems cropped(?).
streetphotography,34rr4g,mikeonthestreet,6,Mon May 4 00:17:05 2015 UTC,What's the connection between the woman and the bottle?  Have you posed this? Why do I ask if you posed this? Because this subreddit is about street photography not photos taken on the street and there is a difference.
streetphotography,34rr4g,DillonVFX,3,Mon May 4 02:24:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with street photography as a genre, is that it is defined by the place from which the image is shot. Every other genre is named by what is in the image. Landscapes for example, are pictures of Landscapes. Street photography however, is not limited to pictures of streets. As a result there is a ridiculous argument over what the boundaries are (see Canon vs Nikon for more idiocy).   This is why many professional organisations (galleries etc) are now using the term Urban photography. Urban photography includes Cityscapes, Abstract architecture, infrastructure and street photography. Street photography is further cut down into two categories. Traditional street photography and neo street photography. This image could be easily classified as Neo-street photography. So by PROFESSIONAL standards, you are wrong. However, I am not saying you are necessarily wrong in the context of the Subreddit. That depends on the intentions of it's creators.   I have an article you may find interesting on the topic. http://tupf.ca/what-is-urban-photography/  /u/Nonchalant_Elephant or other moderators may also find this article interesting. Perhaps it would help for you to either re-classify the Subreddit as Traditional street photography, or leave it as both categories; I think adding in a link or a definition of what the moderators consider to be street photography in the context of this subreddit to the community guidelines is a great idea. I'd love to remove the incessant ""photo police"" commenting (which is funny because it seems that more posts on the front page are told they are not street than those that are) by making it more clear to the community what is and isn't acceptable in the first place.   I have been a fly on the wall for a while now and I am getting very hostile vibes from a number of regular users, and I think this could be putting off a lot of great armatures and preventing growth of the forum. This is kind of important when critique depends a lot on a wide number of opinions, not the voice of a small yet over powering few (even if they are right, but there is currently no proof that their opinion is any more than just that; an opinion). Self moderation is awesome, but prevention is still better than cure. Plus if there are some guidelines to go against, users like DillonVFX will have something concrete to back them up. This will likely prevent stupid cancerous arguments."
streetphotography,34rr4g,MightyHipsterHater,5,Mon May 4 03:36:47 2015 UTC,"They are not ""stupid cancerous arguments."" They're  reactions to people who have no respect for the genre trying to pass off their work as something it isn't, whether they know it or not. I think people are very careful here to point out that the work isn't bad, it's just not SP. It's not up to the mods to change the sub to be more inclusive or ad something to the sidebar, it's up to the submitters to know what the fuck they're talking about and do their research. SP is different from landscapes and portraiture and ""urban"" photography (so glad I have a word for it now other than moody-meaningless-tumblr-trash) because you can't just go do it on your first try. It's difficult because the genre is so rigid and elusive and has such a ""you know it when you see it"" feel. That's why it's elevated beyond your typical candid shot and that's why it draws so many people in. Unfortunately, maybe 10% of those people who are drawn in take the time to learn what the genre is, whereas the other 90% decide to take a picture of someone's back in public and then get all pissed off when we suggest they're not the next Winogrand. I thoroughly disagree with your post, hope the mods change nothing, and encourage anyone else who's not willing to tolerate dumbed-down ""urban photography"" for the sake of not offending people to continue to be vocal and harsh as people continue to try to tumblrize an important form of art."

Such an important point and I'm glad someone else brought it up. There were moments on this subreddit when a user suggested looking at Magnum photographers to understand what makes images better, how layering and colours improve images, etc. The responses were along the lines of ""I don't want to be in Magnum, therefore I don't need to look at their work. I want to shoot ME.""  There's obviously a significance in suggesting Magnum as an area of research, because they are the best of photojournalism and street photography. To dismiss their work of either influence or significance to ""shoot me"" is really immature, and a poor way of developing one's own ability to SEE what is worth capturing."
streetphotography,34rr4g,VeinyPickle,1 point,Mon May 4 14:09:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Street photography is a unique genre in that it's defined more by the process and the traditional of the people who started it than the subjects, and I think this contributes to a sort of barrier of entry that a lot of newcomers either don't understand or recognize and don't respect. Landscapes, portraiture, fashion... Pretty much every other genre is defined by the subject, and therefore it's very simple and easy for new people to jump right in and say ""hey, I took a portrait! Critique it for me!"" And the community can focus on the photo without having to argue about the genre, because the genre is clear. Street photography, on the other hand, was born out of a set of work that already existed and was not shot as street photography. it's something specific about a certain way of shooting that we identified after the fact, and which forms a tradition that we now try to understand and participate in. I think the reason people get mad here here when they're told they're not doing street is that they don't understand the inherent lack of the subjectivity that's present in other genres -- it is rigid, and you're either participating in that tradition or you're not. They're not understanding that we're not calling their work bad photography, we're just saying it categorically doesn't even fit the set of standards they're asking us to hold it to by posting it here for critique as SP."
streetphotography,34rr4g,mj1176,3,Mon May 4 14:22:46 2015 UTC,"The people who commit what you seem to describe as such a heinous crime are simply ignorant. It's okay to be ignorant as long as you learn when taught. First though they have to be taught. Stop telling people they are wrong when you have zero credibility to your name and start showing them what's right by using credible sources. Believe it or not, the average Reddit user is smart enough to not believe everything someone says on the internet without evidence. I love the fact that there are four people who are regularly saying the same thing as you, but NONE of you have even once been able to describe what street photography actually is.   If you can give me a detailed description of waht you consider to be street-photography, what can be included in the frame, what cant, what techniques can and cant be used, what locations are acceptable, and what it must attempt to communicate; then I will start considering you might have some weight to your argument. Right now as it stands its jsut a small group of people constantly jumping up and down pointing their fingers at everyone around them and screaming ""no no no you cant do that!"" while they treat you like a crazy person on the subway."

I'm not about to copy and paste the same shit over and over for every lazy asshole who can't do their own research. I don't tell anyone they can't do anything, I just tell them what I think works and what doesn't -- and yes, when something is obviously outside the genre, I tend to say so. I don't need to come up with a masterlist of all the standards and guidelines for street photography to be able to tell that a tightly framed shot with a single subject is a portrait, not street photography. I don't need to be a well-known photographer with published work to be able to say ""you sniped a shot of someone's back with a telephoto lens at f/2.8 and that pretty definitively prevents this from being good street photography."" It's art, and of course it's subjective, but it's not so subjective that the genre doesn't have guidelines and standards.

You could probably help by posting comments that show users a definition of what you believe street photography is, along with some examples (OC or other) of it, and if you want to spend the time, some of the techniques and tricks in achieving it. Over time I think you will find people will be more likely to conform to this, rather than never returning because you have essentially wrinkled your nose at them and told them to get off your lawn."

It can be logically reduced to: X occurred after Y. Therefore, Y caused X (although A,B,C...etc. also caused X.)

streetphotography,34rr4g,VeinyPickle,2,Mon May 4 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"I think there's a concern because this IS after all, a street photography subreddit. This genre of photography has a basis of capturing CANDID images.  Yes, there are artists like William Klein who often poses their subjects. But for the sake of learning, feedback, and developing your own skills and capabilities, I reckon it's better to understand where street photography's background is coming from and understand the genre instead of taking images on the street and throwing it under the genre. We have portrait, photojournalism, landscape, sport, street, urban, etc. There are genres for a reason, and street is no doubt one of the harder genres to shoot."

I guess my fear of this ""only 6 people who are worthy"" stuff (I'm paraphrasing), and your comment in another thread about private groups, is that the whole thing becomes a bit elitist. This is reddit. It's about community. And yeah, some people dump and run which sucks, and others don't take feedback well (which also sucks when they've asked for it, although identifying that is the case, maybe some of us could shift the way we critique, moving away from ""this is shit because""). But there are quite a few people who are contributing to the sub, all coming from different points in knowledge, style and understanding. That's what makes it a community. That's what stops it being the top 6 giving each other hand jobs while lording over lowly peons who dare contribute.   What do I know? I barely contribute. I lurk. I do so because I love street photography and I love periodically going through and reading the latest submissions. I get something from it. I learn. I appreciate. I enjoy. But I'm not generally one to be overt online about my work or opinions and I don't have the commitment to become a personality. But I do enjoy going through the stream.   I agree with a lot of what is said here too. Not saying anyone is wrong. I only piped up because I'm a pretty firm believer in democracy, which is really what reddit is founded on. Only 6 people matter is the opposite of this ethos.   If you want to shut out the plebs and become exclusive, start a private forum. I think it would be a pretty quiet place... Most of the most vocal users, the ones I'm assuming you are referring to, don't really submit much. There wouldn't be anything to critique.   Again though. What do I know? I just value all contributions here, it's part of the colour. Yeah, those two examples you posted were bad examples of critique not being received well, but you have to take the good with the bad."

Why would anyone do such a thing?     This is reddit. It's about community.     No matter what I say or do, the fact remains that I have zero control and influence of this sub and it will carry on as is.

You wouldn't open a fashion shop front on a high Street and say only people who are dressed well can come in. You'd choose a different outlet.   Feel free to interact privately, start your own collective, or do anything you wish.

I've been sort of shying away from changing the contrast much on film scans to avoid altering the underlying character too much, but you're right, a lot of this has turned to gray and in fairness it's not as though the darkroom print didn't involve contrast adjustments either."
streetphotography,34sfox,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 15:48:08 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate that, but regardless of whether you shoot film, if it ends up being presented on a screen then you should consider some kind of post processing. Look into Nik SilverEfex plugins if you're interested in having fine tuned control over your black and white conversions to retain character."
streetphotography,34sfox,mj1176,1 point,Tue May 5 01:45:44 2015 UTC,"I do some in order to correct for some scanning differences, but as I get into it more I'm coming around on that.  I've looked into the Nik plugins for digital work, but so far have shied away.  I may look into it again though, soon."
streetphotography,34rpkj,johnny5ive,1 point,Mon May 4 00:02:33 2015 UTC,Debating getting a 28/2 to use alongside my 35/2.8. Anyone shoot with that length? Is it really that much wider than the 35 that I'll notice?
streetphotography,34rpkj,arteryal,2,Mon May 4 02:52:48 2015 UTC,Using a 28 exclusively for the past year roughly and I love it but it's not for everyone and it's not very versatile. If you need a little more breathing space around your 35 go for it.
streetphotography,34rpkj,DillonVFX,1 point,Mon May 4 04:35:46 2015 UTC,The difference isn't very big as you can see here. If you get a 28mm replace your 35mm with a 50mm.
streetphotography,34rpkj,johnny5ive,1 point,Mon May 4 02:59:30 2015 UTC,"I've got a 55 as well.  I know I want something wider i'm just wondering if 28 is wide enough or I should go wider.  Thanks for that graphic, never seen the comparison before."
streetphotography,34rpkj,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 12:46:39 2015 UTC,"I shoot 24, 28 and 35. 28 is great for when you're into getting up close and personal. 35 is just good enough to get a whole scene within a good enough distance."
streetphotography,34rpkj,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Mon May 4 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"I shoot a 28 pretty much exclusively for street stuff (and as my daily carry lens) and I absolutely love it, for what that's worth. I find it's a perfect balance between 35 and wider-than-28 options which feel too far from a natural human perspective to me. 40-ish is actually closest to human perspective (contrary to the popular belief that it's 50) and 28 sort of feels like a ""wide-eyed"" natural perspective to me."
streetphotography,34rpkj,johnny5ive,1 point,Mon May 4 16:10:15 2015 UTC,Anyone do professional work? I got asked to do an event in August for a dance studio I regularly practice at. But I have never done any paid work prior to - or pro experience for that matter.. Told them I'd charge $60/hour of shooting and I'd throw in editing/PP for free (seeing as I don't do much). Did I sell myself too low or is this a good start?
streetphotography,34rpkj,johnny5ive,2,Mon May 4 05:13:46 2015 UTC,I haven't seen your work but this is way too low unless you're terrible
streetphotography,34r9q2,The_Peach,4,Sun May 3 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite sure why you chose to share this. Can you enlighten us as to what this image is of, or about?"
streetphotography,34r9q2,arteryal,1 point,Mon May 4 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"Hi and thank you for taking time for commenting. The picture is from an area in London quite famous for being always buzzing with life till late. This is taken on a Saturday night, liked the atmosphere and the lighting and I was trying to show a part of the area from a more quiet position, trying to find peace in the mess."
streetphotography,34r9q2,arteryal,2,Mon May 4 07:20:07 2015 UTC,That's not really coming across in the image. I highly recommend going back there and spending significant amounts of time (hours) hanging out and looking that kind of scene.
streetphotography,34r9q2,Cameronjpr,1 point,Mon May 4 09:01:10 2015 UTC,Thank you. I appreciate your comment and agree.
streetphotography,34r9q2,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Mon May 4 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me, but what do I know. Always love visiting that part of town."
streetphotography,34r9q2,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 00:07:12 2015 UTC,"Well, thanks for swinging by anyway."
streetphotography,34r9q2,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 07:07:36 2015 UTC,Man you took a picture of nothing going on from really far away. Why did you do this
streetphotography,34r9q2,mj1176,1 point,Mon May 4 01:12:44 2015 UTC,Probably just liked the lighting.
streetphotography,34r9q2,mj1176,0,Mon May 4 07:12:19 2015 UTC,"Ok, so consider then... What are your motivations in keeping and presenting this photo for critique? If it's just lighting you liked with nothing interesting in the frame, why not get rid of it and move on? Furthermore, why try to have it critiqued as street photography in particular?"
streetphotography,34r8hp,dreamking88,1 point,Sun May 3 21:32:57 2015 UTC,My first attempt at street photography. Feedback is much appreciated. Thanks!
streetphotography,34r8hp,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Sun May 3 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/arteryal mostly, especially the keep going and shoot everything part. However I think you should always critique your own images. Every single one. Think about what you wanted to do, whether you did it and how well you did it. Then you can focus on how to improve. I also think it is very important to develop your own style, and trust your own taste. Many people will not like it. That is okay, because many others will. A lot of great street photographers dislike each other's style, but the RESPECT each other. Never forget to respect someone else's taste.   Surely if you don't analyse yourself for 3 years, you wont have actually improved. You'll just keep making the same mistakes and wondering why your latest images are no better. Keep analysing yourself and keep asking for other people's thoughts. Ask for a wide range of different people's thoughts. Consider who your target audience is.  In terms of the image, I guess it is considered street (a) location accessible to the public (b) portrayal of human condition and interaction. What I do like about it, is it's kind of like a where's Wally. I keep looking around and investigating all the faces, and then all of a sudden I find the bald guy who is looking away from the table. He is unique for the fact that he is the only one starting into the distance. It makes me wonder what he is thinking or what he is looking at. This is called enigma, and it sparks discussion between viewers when hung in a gallery.  Now what you need to do in order to improve it, is focus on composing it better so he really pops out and grabs your attention. Having said that, I'm sure many art lovers would prefer to FIND him. Perhaps jsut positioning him vaguely with the rule of thirds and against the most bold natural contrast will do the trick. There should be a way to make him stand out the most, but not so much that the viewer ignores the rest of the image.  The image also lacks depth, which is an important aspect of photography. Photographs are static and 2D, so if you can create depth and make them feel dynamic, you are doing well. TO create more depth in this one, you could use the real-estate trick to shoot towards the corner of the room. I would guess about 5-6 steps to your left and 30 degrees to the right. Then you can line up the bald man with the back corner of the room. He will now be at the center point of this depth and the focal point of the image.  Overall, the image is nothing special and has a lot of improvement needed, but I like it because it agrees with my personal tastes."
streetphotography,34r8hp,arteryal,1 point,Mon May 4 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified my position. Of course OP needs to be critical of their own work, but I don't believe there's any value in other people critiquing their work, now. If you also have a job or other commitments, the street photography you're going to make in the first 5 years is going to be shit. It just is. Dig your way out and find your own direction."
streetphotography,34r8hp,MightyHipsterHater,1 point,Mon May 4 04:21:36 2015 UTC,aaah I see.
streetphotography,34r8hp,arteryal,1 point,Mon May 4 04:23:47 2015 UTC,A sincere thank you for taking the time to give me feedback. I appreciate it.
streetphotography,34kna9,scenesofnewyorkcity,7,Fri May 1 23:56:27 2015 UTC,"I like that you got up close and I like the little bit of humour, not bad. Improvement could be made by standing just ever so slightly to the left."
streetphotography,34kna9,DillonVFX,3,Sat May 2 08:39:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks dillion.  Can't say I agree with moving to the left, considering that it would make it very difficult to avoid overlap between man and woman on left side of frame, and I would lose some of the girl's face.  I do think clear improvement could be made by simply getting closer."
streetphotography,34kna9,DillonVFX,1 point,Sat May 2 23:30:25 2015 UTC,That's right moving to the left would have the overlap problem. Pointing the camera a little to the left would've been the correct solution.
streetphotography,34kna9,meetbaxter,1 point,Sun May 3 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"Rad photo, and great job on avoiding the overlap in the moment. I agree with Dillonvfx's feedback, it's a shame it wasn't SLIGHTLY framed left... But to be honest it's a pretty small criticism in the 1/250th of a second you had to nab this."
streetphotography,34kna9,Boosted03gti,1 point,Tue May 5 08:03:36 2015 UTC,Solid capture! Thank you for posting. It's nice to see a great example of street photography in this sub. Doesn't happen often enough. Great work.  I also started a street photography club in nyc that has monthly meetings. Check it out.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/nycstreetphotographerclub/
streetphotography,34kr5c,Andresvila,3,Sat May 2 00:32:01 2015 UTC,"Cut out the boring photos like people buying from a street vendor. Avoid messy backgrounds. Photos of bottles are not street photography nor are urban landscapes. This is an alright photo but it doesn't belong here. I don't care for your photos of your girlfriend, I'm not one of your friends and the shots with her in it aren't interesting so why are you showing me them? The best shot out of the album is this for the geometry but it still has problems like a diagonal line cutting into the guy."
streetphotography,34kr5c,DillonVFX,2,Sun May 3 07:33:15 2015 UTC,Was looking at your photos and can tell why you thought the photo of the power plant an alright photo since it goes with you extreme contrast way you shoot. i find that technique to work when you really put the center of attention of the photo and black everything else out. They are just photos of a trip to new york shes just a friend and i liked the contrast i was getting from the x100s with the red black and white filter put on.   Edit:spelling and i find it funny how you didn't like the same photos which were the ones that a canon award winning photographer said were the best ones be it they where only three of them. I'm more inclined to hear his opinions. but i am thankful that you took your time to look over my photos and talk about them.
streetphotography,34kr5c,DillonVFX,1 point,Sun May 3 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"I liked the power plant photo because of the quality of light, not because it looks like one of my photos.  I wouldn't put too much stock in the opinion of someone that won a Canon competition above other photographers that haven't, one of my photos placed first in a Canon competition last year but it hasn't made me a better photographer. I also don't actively go around advertising it, the only people that know I won outside of my friends are people that bothered to read the little description under one of my photos. And the Canon competitions will always have a little bit of bias towards having ""pretty"" photos win because well it's advertising for Canon after all.  Besides if you're referring to the same photographer that won the Canon comp that I'm thinking of I've found their photos mostly about being aesthetically pretty that are very appealing on instagram (and there's nothing particularity wrong about taking those photos) but they lack compelling and engaging content that makes you think more than just ""wow that photo is pretty""."
streetphotography,34kr5c,DillonVFX,1 point,Mon May 4 02:18:10 2015 UTC,Well no thats not the only reason i take his opinion seriously hes also one of my really good friends and in my opinion the if not the best well one of the best photographers to come out of Puerto Rico. Francisco Roman http://franciscoromanphoto.com/ you should check out his work i'm pretty sure you'll like them.
streetphotography,34kr5c,arteryal,1 point,Mon May 4 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"Well your friend isn't the Canon award winner I was thinking of so that's good and they are a good photographer though they do need to do a tighter edit of their ""personal work"".  Get more opinions from more photographers that are experienced. I know a large variety of experienced/exhibited/award winning photographers that have various styles that I can draw feedback from."
streetphotography,34kr5c,electro_husky,1 point,Mon May 4 02:34:13 2015 UTC,"Was looking at your photos and can tell why you thought     No you can't. Content and form are kings and that applies to all visual art forms of all styles and aesthetic variations. Whatever /u/dillonvfx work looks like doesn't take away from the fact that his opinion is 100% valid. Now, I may or may not agree with him and you're welcome to do the same but to be so dismissive suggests that you're only here for some kind of validation... and that's a giant waste of everyone's time."

streetphotography,34kpq7,quitethequietdomino,3,Sat May 2 00:18:30 2015 UTC,"Why is the frame slanted? The slant isn't adding anything to this composition. You also don't have interesting subject matter, if the main subject is supposed to be the guy surfing his phone with food serving gloves on (which is a nasty hygiene-wise) you've got him awkwardy in the corner being obstructed by an object."
streetphotography,34kpq7,DillonVFX,3,Sat May 2 08:19:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the critique. I'm relatively new to street photography so I'm still learning how to compose shots. I'll keep that in mind!
streetphotography,34f37f,xprocessed,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Don't spend your whole title explaining how you got the photo, let your photo speak for itself.   The silhouettes in the shot unfortunately aren't interesting enough and the person on the left in particular bothers me, you've got a person dressed in dark clothes at night against a dark background. The composition needs more visual drama."
streetphotography,34fbk3,ugly_whiskey_smoker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:51:32 2015 UTC,The composition is really messy and I can't find anything in the frame that's supposed to stand out. The man between Marilyn and the umbrella in particular is distracting.
streetphotography,34fbk3,DillonVFX,1 point,Sat May 2 08:26:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to critique!   I was happy to see the man in the frame there because, while not the subject, I like his interest in ""Marilyn"". The composition isn't great though the umbrella placement was intentional. Only my second time using a rangefinder and perhaps my judging of the framelines is off. I'll be more careful.   I guess the photo doesn't really SAY anything. It was just an interesting frame to my eyes."
streetphotography,34e7yy,seemedlegitatfirst,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:50:59 2015 UTC,The moment you captured itself isn't interesting. If you had waited for them to interact with the street vendor it would've been a tiny bit more interesting but it still wouldn't work well enough.

streetphotography,347s91,moshtrocity,2,Tue Apr 28 23:52:20 2015 UTC,Some blunt feedback.  I think #2 is the strongest. I like the dude and the relation to the billboard behind him.  #4 could have been great with a simpler background or getting closer to eliminate more from the the edges of the frame.  Ditch #6. It's seem like the only reason it's included is because dwarf.   The people on the left in #1 completely detract from the interesting characters on the right. The right half of the image is really good though.

streetphotography,347s91,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"I thnk 1 and 3 are strongest. I really like 5 but it almost looks posed, which is kind of just unfortunate and not really your fault imo.   Agree 4 could have been a lot closer. Would personally ditch 6 and 8.  I think I've seen your instagram, gorgeous colors. Your film processing/scanning game is realllll tight."
streetphotography,347s91,scenesofnewyorkcity,1 point,Sat May 2 00:36:39 2015 UTC,Thanks! Ill probs ditch the dwarf pic. Is the last one weak because its from the side?
