CODZombies,3e13yh,A7XZ,5,Tue Jul 21 12:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yes and upgraded 2.0 perks should only be obtainable after buying the 1.0 version of the perk first, instead of having a separate 2.0 perk machine like they did in tranzit. So for example i buy jug for 2500 points and that gives me normal jug, but now i have the option of saving another 3000 points and buying jug again with 3000 while i already have it and this will give me jug 2.0.

Say you can get 4 perks in a game, all of these shouldn't be able to be upgraded at once, your max slots for upgraded perks would be 1. so you get your 4 perks (say jugg, DT, QR, SC) for their original prices, then you can choose one of these perks to go over and buy again to increase the strength of it by 50%, for a higher cost. things like Jugg would be more expensive than other perks.  this is just my idea, not how it would have to be done"
CODZombies,3e13yh,TheCraffey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:11 2015 UTC,idk upgrading jug seems a little op it would have to be 25000 and you could only take 1 or 2 more hits. assuming there is no bank. i would be comfortable doing challenges to upgrade like kill 10 zombies while red screen to upgrade jug
CODZombies,3e13yh,itsnotbrad15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:44:26 2015 UTC,I don't think it would really make you stronger. It would probably add additional effect. My guess is they take phd minus the Dolphins dive and put it on jugg 2.0

CODZombies,3e28nk,GoGoGodzillaaa,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:09 2015 UTC,I dunno I am a bit confused lol
CODZombies,3e28nk,Fatalbobblehead,3,Tue Jul 21 11:56:12 2015 UTC,"Here is what I understand:  Origins Tank, Nikolai, and Takeo go into the future to Der Riese in attempts to stop WW2 Richtofen from continuing his plans (which is everything we have played from Der Riese to Buried) ie blowing up the Earth from the moon. These three Origins characters know that Origins Richtofen is in that teleporter so they attempt reverse psychology on him in order to get him to open the door."
CODZombies,3e28nk,MrChips_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:23 2015 UTC,Why do they want him to open the door? They could have just shot Richtofen themselves but it doesn't seem like they want him dead when they tell the new Richtofen that he shouldn't mess with time after he shoots the old Richtofen.
CODZombies,3e28nk,InfectedP0tato,4,Tue Jul 21 15:25:20 2015 UTC,"They never wanted to shoot richtofen, richtofen himself makes his own plan and he says ""it's for the greater good"". This plan involved killing his alternate universe self and the 3 didn't know about it."
CODZombies,3e28nk,MrChips_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:32:45 2015 UTC,"So they had an initial plan with the new Richtofen, but instead he simply shot him?  I think that makes sense, I just wonder why he would go against the plan and how/where they got the chance and information to come up with such a scheme."
CODZombies,3e28nk,Fatalbobblehead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:26 2015 UTC,I think you are confused. The Richtofen that is shot is older in terms of age. He is the one who teleported Maxis and Sam and blew up the moon. The younger Richtofen (the one we play as in Origins) comes through the teleporter. I believe Samantha warned them of the future and they are trying to prevent all of the events that could unfold
CODZombies,3e28nk,Fatalbobblehead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:22 2015 UTC,I never said they wanted him dead. They wanted him to open the door to let Richtofen out
CODZombies,3e28nk,Gamer9131,0,Tue Jul 21 18:30:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it's that. Why are they so surprised and annoyed even then?
CODZombies,3e28nk,InfectedP0tato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:50 2015 UTC,Not only into the future but in an alternate storyline because the origins time line collapsed because of Samantha.
CODZombies,3e28nk,KingoftheCastle94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:19 2015 UTC,I think the big question is WHY are they tempting him. This whole thing confuses me lol
CODZombies,3e28nk,InfectedP0tato,2,Tue Jul 21 13:46:43 2015 UTC,So they can bring other richtofen in. They came in from teleporters and mainframe but not the last teleporter.
CODZombies,3e28nk,KingoftheCastle94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"ahh i see, i mean i would have thought they could just shoot him and open the teleporter themselves but i guess tricking him into opening it works too"

Maybe make another human-like boss that has some melee weapon and for speed cola he swings faster, for double tap he does double damage, mule kick gives it a melee weapon for each hand, and deadshot makes him more accurate with his attacks. I'm thinking like Brutus here but much harder"
CODZombies,3e1hg1,MCunleashed,4,Tue Jul 21 06:08:01 2015 UTC,I love this idea but some are broken as stated unless perk zombies get a special round I.E. Hellhounds they would be too difficult for average play

CODZombies,3e1hg1,InfectedP0tato,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:46 2015 UTC,Speed cola could either make you have a smaller mag capacity to make you reload more or maybe you reload at random intervals. Who's who might make your gun the starting pistol but an upgraded version that can take out the guy in 1 mag. The gun is useless against any other zombie except the boss.
CODZombies,3e1hg1,TheCraffey,2,Tue Jul 21 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"Speed cola could also make it so reloading takes away the ammo in your mag, so if you have to use all your ammo and deal with the longer reload time"
CODZombies,3e1hg1,InfectedP0tato,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:38:11 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as longer reload time, just reload cancel once you see your mag is full in the bottom left  The Olympia is the biggest example of this, the second the first shell is in the barrel, it loads 2. The reload animation continues but you don't need to continue, just knife or run."
CODZombies,3e1hg1,TheCraffey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:00 2015 UTC,Wait... So is speed cola unnecessary
CODZombies,3e1hg1,InfectedP0tato,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"No, it's one of the best perks. When I say long reload I mean when you are out of ammo then you have too pull back the slide or something like that. You don't need to."
CODZombies,3e1hg1,TheCraffey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:34 2015 UTC,Ohh ok. Thanks
CODZombies,3e1hg1,TheMongrelNut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:18 2015 UTC,Anti-speed cola could be a 'jam'.  No lost ammo - you just need to reload to fix the problem.
CODZombies,3e1hg1,Yamaha234,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:54 2015 UTC,Speed Cola: you can't reload <= X distance from zombie.  Tombstone: has 2 lives

You pay 500 to get into the station then you get off when you get to the stop you want. If another player enters the train station somewhere else they have to wait for the train or the other people to leave the station.  The interior will be like the bus bus and you can only go into one car, the others don't open. You have to hold off in the train."

CODZombies,3e2mcl,iSlayMightyBees,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:03 2015 UTC,Imo fuck what other people think and start playing in public lobbies with 3 players. Games are more enjoyable when its 4 players with mics all enjoying themselves and working together. Look up the Origins codwiki and find out everything about it. What i did was the first 10/12 games i never bothered with the EE building staffs etc because i knew i needed good map knowledge before i did that. So first i just played it like a normal barebones zombies map to get a feel for where everything was. Trying to survive for as long as possible. Once i knew the map inside out i looked up all the staffs and upgrading guides and screenshotted and printed them out (sad i know) and then i looked at them as i was playing to do the EE staffs etc xD hope this helps
CODZombies,3e2mcl,KingoftheCastle94,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:33 2015 UTC,"that's not sad, I've got a sheet printed out with the puzzle solutions for upgrading the staves also.....very helpful and a huge time saver"

CODZombies,3e4u3r,ChallengeFreakinOwne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're being downvoted, because you're completely right. BO3 is a new game, and as good as zombies already is, it needs to change from game to game. If it remained exactly the same, then it would get boring. Saying that there should be no advanced movement in BO3 zombies just because there hasn't been before, is like saying that you shouldn't add new objectives, guns or perks because they also haven't been there before. I doubt they will add advanced movement to ""The Giant"", because it's SUPPOSED to feel old, but it makes complete sense for them to implement it in the new map. I love the style and feel of most of the previous maps, and I can go back and play them any time I want. As far as BO3 goes, it needs to have its own style like those before it did, and advanced movement is one of the many ways they're going to do that."
CODZombies,3e4u3r,rhcp88,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:16:07 2015 UTC,"The flaw in your logic is that a lot of people have upgraded to current gen, and the only zombies available on that (at the moment, maybe backwards compatibility could happen for CoD someday, who knows) is the terrible experience that is exozombies.  Now personally I still have my 360, but Treyarch needs to keep zombies the same so that fans of the classic experience have some zombies to play that doesn't suck horribly, and I'm confident that they will do this."
CODZombies,3e4u3r,ChallengeFreakinOwne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:31:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if someone enjoys zombies mode that much, then they shouldn't be getting rid of the only piece of hardware that they need to play it. The Giant is there for a classic experience, but the new maps need to be new. I play on PC, so I can't speak about the backwards compatibility factor, but I'm sure that that's an issue that will be addressed soon enough. BO3 is a different game from WAW, BO1 and BO2, so it's understandable that those changes will be present in Zombies mode. Treyarch loves their zombies, and they're not going to add anything that will take away from the overall feel of the mode. And if advanced movement turns out not to be a good addition to zombies, nobody's forcing you to use it."

CODZombies,3e2n2q,bigthagen87,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:33 2015 UTC,"It sounds like Shadow Man in SoE grants some abilities, but at a cost. So I am thinking there will be some kind of perks that have some kind of benefit as well as a side affect. I think Windows Wine is going to be something like you have less health, but your guns are twice as powerful or something to that affect. So expanding on yours, maybe Half Ammo makes your guns more powerful as well. Harder to Kill: Zombies have more health but are more likely to drop perks. No Box for You: play who picks it up can't buy from the box, but weapons off the wall are only 100 points. Respawn: Zombies all disappear and respawn, but your ammo is returned to where it was when the round started. Run For Your Life: Zombies run faster, but you can sprint for a longer period of time (temporary Speed Cola, but maybe 50% longer sprint instead of 100%)."
CODZombies,3e2n2q,bigthagen87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:39 2015 UTC,I like this train of thought.  Another way to balance the disadvantage would be to pair up the black magic with white magic shortly thereafter.  You take the Half Ammo knowing that Max Ammo will show up within that same round.

CODZombies,3e2j1k,InfectedP0tato,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, everything you said after old gen made no sense. Bigger is never better, especially in zombies. What does Tranzit have to do with anything and what do you mean by ""yes it can be on current -not new- gen without fog,"" no shit it can. If PS3 and 360 could handle it why would PS4 and Xbox One handling it be so surprising?  As for your question, what Infected Potato said is true, weapons weren't an issue. New tech should not mean new weapons, more weapons, and bigger maps. First, more weapons means more crap weapons and a lower chance of getting good ones. Bigger maps mean more area to travel to and therefore making it a bigger problem if one of your team leaves to get Jug or something and gets trapped. For example, Shadows of Evil's size, from what I've seen, looks similar in size to Mob of the Dead and Origins. This doesn't mean there must be more perks, weapons, mystery boxes, spawn locations, etc."
CODZombies,3e2j1k,Molotov22719,4,Tue Jul 21 16:29:24 2015 UTC,"I said without fog, the fog was there so the console didn't have to render the entire map at once so it could work on last gen.

CODZombies,3e1m1j,bigthagen87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:44:16 2015 UTC,"I think it will either begin or end the EE, or both.   Begin - shoot the flytrap and all the objects fly off. You then have to go find all the objects to use for the EE.   End - Steps you do during the EE power up the fly trap, and you have to shoot it to release whatever it is that is harnessed in the fly trap, thus ending the EE.  I guess either of these could be steps during the EE as well."

For example, if you buy mule kick once, it's 1.0, then you can buy it again for 3000 points and you get 2.0.  Additionally, dead shot 2.0 seems pretty OP.

Instead of cycling through to your 3rd weapon with Triangle or Y, maybe the 3rd weapon is available by clicking a direction on the D-pad. This way Triangle or Y will cycle through your 1st 2 weapons, making it easier to cycle through.

I don't think they should be available that way from the start... but maybe it works as a rebuy... for example speed cola is 3000... maybe once you have it... you can buy the upgrade version from the same machine for 1.5 x price... like 4500 or something.  This would force you into later rounds before you could afford to upgrade perks... would basically be like pack a punching your perks...

At the end of the Origins easter egg she tells them to step into the light and apparently they will be rewarded.  I'm gussing that Samantha lied and she teleported them to Der Riese.  Obviously it was Richtofen's motive to go to Der Riese as well, but maybe Samantha and Richtofen are working together.  They both want Maxis alive now."

I think Gears of War does a great job tracking all sorts of stats. If you haven't played, you can see at the bottom there is 29 pages of stats. Of course, a lot of these pages are the different weapons, but I would love to see this kind, and amount, of information."
CODZombies,3dz2tp,GINGERtheKAT,3,Tue Jul 21 13:59:08 2015 UTC,"I love all of them, but mostly the last one. That'd be so useful.  Also average number doors they opened out of blank number of doors in the map would be cool so we can see who's cheap and who's a team player. Also a percentage showing if they revive players. It would go like ""They revived a downed team mate 78% of the time"". Also if you're playing 4 or 3 players and someone goes down but another one of your team mates revives him, that would not hurt your revive stat."

CODZombies,3e02b3,MOISTY_OYSTER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:54:54 2015 UTC,"Yea...that's my interpretation of it. I could be completely wrong. My thought on Der Riese though is that I don't see why they wouldn't make it bigger and better. If they took the time to make a trailer and get people excited about it, I think it's going to be a good (we'll say) ""new"" map based on Der Riese, not to mention kind of sorta renaming it (translating it for a new name). Otherwise, why not just let it be an EE of sorts within the game and have it unlock if you beat the Campaign or something. Also, just doing a ""reskin"" of Der Riese wouldn't really move the story forward. So, I think it's going to be quite a bit different than the original Der Riese we all know at this time."
CODZombies,3e02b3,bigthagen87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thinking. Treyarch has touted this as the biggest, deepest, most involved zombies experience to date. So ""The Giant"" is not going to be ""Der Riese"" with a fresh coat of paint only."
CODZombies,3e02b3,MOISTY_OYSTER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:37:31 2015 UTC,"Aren't they referring to SoE for that though? I still think SoE will be all of those things over The Giant, but I think TG is the more important of the two in terms of where they will go with DLC."

They were related, well say. If they start a completely new series, whatever it may be, Zombies may not fit in.

Activision most likely wont give them a heads up like ""hey guys you game developers are gonna be out of jobs because we're ending the COD series"" it'll probably be unexpected. Storyline wise though we'll probably end up with an ending as far as we know. Think about it, if they wanted to, the Origins cutscene could've been an ending.

CODZombies,3dzuch,VictoriansChaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:08:42 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's going to be the same plan as original Richtofen except instead of the end goal of controlling zombies, the end goal of not letting Maxis control zombies. What I mean is I think he wants to go to the Moon and instead of swapping bodies with Sam he wants to free her and destroy the MPD."
CODZombies,3dzuch,Yamaha234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:48:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, it'll probably be in the courtyard with the mainframe, as always. For obvious gameplay reasons, nah. At this point, I don't know. Maybe a secret tunnel leading to a new underground section? LOL nope, zombies will eat him up before you can even get to Teleporter C to see his body."
CODZombies,3dzuch,RdJokr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"I think they are going to change up the map quite a bit. They said the layout will be the same, but everything else is changed. So, the mainframe may be put in a different place and could be that room that the trailer is in. So,   1 - Maybe  2 - Doubt it. I think they will come up with some new way to turn on the power though, rather than just flipping a switch. They seemed to really like generators in Origins and MotD, so maybe each transporter will have it's own generator you have to power some how.  3 - I think there is going to be more upstairs. We can see some upstairs areas that we aren't able to get to. If I recall correctly, the area to the right of the PaP (if you are facing the PaP) has 3 or 4 stories, so I think they will open that up and maybe show us some labs and / or offices.   4 - I think a zombified Richtofen will be a mini-boss, like Brutus."

CODZombies,3dyp0i,smoke3x14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like it could be good with some proper tweaks. I've only used it once or twice, but it would be a pretty good perk if you had some way of distracting the zombies for long enough to revive yourself with relative ease. It shouldn't be a 100% guaranteed revive, however if it were about 90% survival rate with some good skill, I would use it."
CODZombies,3dyp0i,YourNotAngryNeighbor,5,Mon Jul 20 21:53:46 2015 UTC,"I would go as far to say that Who's Who is the worst perk to grace the Call of Duty Zombies franchise. Most perks that players consider bad, aren't all that bad, they just do not offer as much as an advantage as others. Who's Who on the the other hand is such a detriment to the player when equipped (especially playing solo). If I'm on a high round and go down with Who's Who, I'm screwed. The only way to get rid of the zombies is to train them around the map far enough to get them away so I can revive myself."
CODZombies,3dyp0i,jdlevy95,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"And don't forget time is a factor, too (I think).  Doubt you have enough time to run through all of the elevator map before it expires.  Quick Revive in solo is so much better."
CODZombies,3dyp0i,L1amas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, atleast on co-op. On solo this thing is an absolute disgrace. However, on co-op this thing will allow you to keep your perks upon going down. I always camp on the map, so as long as you have a friend or friends, they can revive you instead of trying to use your ghost. And instead of having to tread through the map, you can run right back into the action with all your perks again, quite helpful."
CODZombies,3dyp0i,marinafanatic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"Ya I really have 0 experience with Who's Who on co-op. Every time I have gotten it, I never had to use it."

CODZombies,3dyp0i,GroundTar,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"no, but i wouldnt mind a ringtone/notification that just did the ""WHO'S WHO!"""
CODZombies,3dyp0i,marty25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like it to, but even if it did, I just wouldn't buy it. It seemed like an amazing concept at first, but it's only useful at early rounds. Even then though, you're saving up for the other perks, you're not going to buy Who's Who until later. If they were to change some things in it, like maybe give you one or both of your weapons when you spawn as a ghost, then I'd endorse that. It's useless if used at a high round though, even at round 15. I understand people are effective at training and can work around it but I simply don't like it's current state. Imagine dying at round 40 solo and having to navigate to your body defenselessly, Quick Revive is much better than Who's Who."

But nothing can describe the feeling I got the very first time on moon when Avenged Sevenfold started playing. The fact that the way to unlock the song is so specific, that it seems almost random the first time you unknowingly do it, just puts it over the edge when the song dawns on you as you go to town in zero gravity zombie slaying goodness."

CODZombies,3dy6mc,UAPassing,13,Mon Jul 20 14:30:07 2015 UTC,"because the map that it was in was so badly designed.  I hardly remember a single time where we were able to get someone to spawn close enough to their tombstone to actually obtain it in time.  i mean im definitely not going to forego speed cola, staminup, or double tap for it.  And jugg is obviously number 1.  so tombstone simply doesn't make the cut  I think that is why a lot of people were advocating for Jugg to be taken out of the game and just make the standard damage from zombies take 5 hits to down you instead of 2, although it would make the early rounds a bit easier, it would allow more creativity in perk designs since everyone would have more of a tough decision on which perks to buy"
CODZombies,3dy6mc,ozarkslam21,11,Mon Jul 20 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree with jugg being taken out. The entire point of jugg I'd like walking on thin ice. If you go down and lose it you're pretty much screwed late game unless you're really good and manage to get back on your feet. Without that risk I feel late game is going to lose a lot of its challenge, it'd just be too easy."
CODZombies,3dy6mc,andrez123100,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"yeah that is the downside to it.  I guess the other option would be that they include an extra perk spot and make it 5 total that you could buy.  The perks i feel should be about having to make a tough choice on which ones you need and which ones you will do without, and nobody willingly chooses to not buy jugg"
CODZombies,3dy6mc,ozarkslam21,12,Mon Jul 20 18:56:32 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the concern came from Tombstone being in Tranzit. If you went down you usually weren't brought back to life anywhere near your drop and therefore it was rendered useless unless you were playing with experienced players.
CODZombies,3dy6mc,beater613,6,Mon Jul 20 14:55:13 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what the other guy said. It was introduced in Tranzit, where it was almost useless due to the size of the map"
CODZombies,3dy6mc,jacob2815,4,Mon Jul 20 15:05:43 2015 UTC,"It encouraged people to give up mid round even when you could've revived them, forcing you to be alone in a difficult situation"

I will say it's impossible to find a match using the public match finder but that doesn't mean there aren't multiple steam groups with hundreds of people who still play and are constantly looking for people to play with.   And as another massive advantage you've got custom maps, there are literally probably around 2000 custom zombies maps around now, I don't know why anyone would play on anything but PC to be honest.   Definitely recommend.  Edit: if you get it add me on steam(garrettjoecox) and we'll play sometime. And anyone reading this for that matter."

CODZombies,3dyqnu,SpudTheSpartan,-13,Mon Jul 20 17:40:26 2015 UTC,sigh pc master race mentality...
CODZombies,3dyqnu,Yamaha234,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"Everything he said was fact. There's nothing advantageous about the console version. There's only 2 reasons you shouldn't play zombies on PC. 1. You have more friends on console, 2. You don't want to spend the money on building a PC. It's not a PC master race mentality, it's just comparing the game on different platforms."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,SpudTheSpartan,-6,Mon Jul 20 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"I was being sarcastic, jeez"

CODZombies,3dyqnu,Suparockr,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:39 2015 UTC,the most difficult thing is finding people to play with.  Call of Duty is dead on PC.
CODZombies,3dyqnu,Suparockr,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:37 2015 UTC,What about the gameplay itself? Does it take time to get used to or will my skill from console transfer over in a way
CODZombies,3dyqnu,ACanadianPenguin,3,Mon Jul 20 17:40:44 2015 UTC,"mouse accuracy has a record of being miles better than controller.  With that said, why not just plug in a controller if you want anyway?  Nothing is stopping you."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,Volgarr11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:32 2015 UTC,"As someone who played zombies on console religiously id say my skill has stayed with me, but like others have said finding a good game is difficult. Playing with someone in Russia who is the host makes you lag like no tomorrow.   If your looking for someone to play zombies with on PC feel free to hit me up."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,Volgarr11,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"agreed, and if you do find anyone, there is no way to communicate with them because 1 out of 100 use mics. And push-to-talk is annoying."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,ObiWantKanabis,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:44 2015 UTC,I would probably find people here
CODZombies,3dyqnu,Volgarr11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's still hard to do, I've tried and I've found a few people, but the problem is time zones."

CODZombies,3dyqnu,bigthagen87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but no one has mics, thats what i was trying to say."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,bigthagen87,3,Mon Jul 20 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"Ive played on PS3 for a couple years, then moved to PC, i definately enjoy more zombies, plus, having mic on PC is way more common than having mic on PS3, a bad thing about PC is the game population, u may have a hard time to find someone on zombies (not multiplayer though) but this group is also to find players!"
CODZombies,3dyqnu,bigthagen87,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:22 2015 UTC,"Are you still going to play with a controller on PC or stick with keyboard and mouse? Some people have trouble adjusting to a keyboard and mouse, but I think once you get the hang of it, it should be a lot easier to aim. Your gamer ""IQ"", we'll call it, should stick with you. You just have to get used to moving around with the keyboard and mouse.  In terms of fun, I have always found PC to be a lot more solo compared to consoles. There is usually a lot more people online on console, where as PC gamers are more into MMO's and such, so there aren't near as many people in MP / Zombies.   With that said, you can hack / mod easier on PC. I have been using hacks in custom solo games for the past week just to see what Easter Eggs I missed and such. It has added a bit of replayability where before I wouldn't play as much because I couldn't redo the EE's solo. People can say what they want about it but sometimes it's nice to just run through a map with god mode and such."
CODZombies,3dyqnu,bigthagen87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:55 2015 UTC,Thanks. This pretty much sums it up I think
CODZombies,3dyqnu,bigthagen87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Cool. I am actually doing the reverse of what you sound like you are doing. I played every COD up until AW on PC (got AW for free on X1). BO3 I will be getting for Xbox as well, mainly because of the Jugg Edition. That, mixed with more people play on console it seems."
