HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,scasoni,47,Mon Jul 20 15:38:46 2015 UTC,Those 3rd world squat gains though
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,goplaymariokart,16,Mon Jul 20 17:32:30 2015 UTC,Dat ankle flexibility on the far left. His torso is vertical with his ass touching the ground!!!
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,bjorgein,10,Mon Jul 20 18:00:17 2015 UTC,"I looked at that and thought ""Man, I can do that.""  No, no I can't."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,justsomeguy_youknow,7,Mon Jul 20 18:23:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is how we should be able to sit, but since we rarely use that range of motion (thanks to chairs), it's nearly impossible to do."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,bjorgein,4,Mon Jul 20 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"I think some people quit squatting because they were told it was improper or would damage their knees. I'm kind of an urban savage though. Rarely wear shoes, feet are filthy and armored with decades of callouses, I squat like I'm taking a shit with legs wide apart all the time while digging in the dirt and I eat with a bowl sitting on my chest."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,RadioIsMyFriend,3,Mon Jul 20 18:55:11 2015 UTC,"As long as your knees track over the toes and you maintain tension on the posterior (hammies, low back) your meniscus shouldn't be at risk."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,bjorgein,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:40 2015 UTC,"I can get that low, and it's super comfortable to chill that way, but my ankles don't have that mobility and always ache (sitting on the front part of my foot with the heel in the air thing). Will that mobility ever come?"
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,Muffikins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"If you stretch, frequently and actually work towards that, I don't see why not. It will probably take quite some time though."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,bjorgein,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't it supposed to be more like what the other guys are doing, more of a squat? I can do that, which made me think that I could do what dude #1 was doing, it's a pretty extreme difference."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,justsomeguy_youknow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:54:04 2015 UTC,"I don't have any issues doing what the guy on the left is doing, at least i dont think I do. The hardest part is probably getting my back that straight."

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,essenceofreddit,58,Mon Jul 20 15:36:54 2015 UTC,A lot of old photographs were really badly staged by modern standards and it looks a bit silly.

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,cobawsky,11,Mon Jul 20 17:55:19 2015 UTC,I wonder who was in charge of protecting the pot. That must have been a very important job.
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,ReallyGreatGuy,24,Mon Jul 20 16:15:31 2015 UTC,thats my job at home...
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,AnoK760,22,Mon Jul 20 16:21:46 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: In South Africa, the home of the Zulus, that ""cauldron"" is known as a potjie (meaning little-pot and pronounced poi-key) - Food made in one is called potjiekos meaning little pot food."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,BobGeldof2nd,39,Mon Jul 20 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify what he said, those are the Afrikaans terms for that.  The Zulu for that would refer to stew made in a cauldron, so closest would be ""ebhodweni sikadali"", but from experience the Afrikaans vernacular has entered the lingo, so everyone knows what a ""potjie"" is when talking about a dish."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,quintinza,14,Mon Jul 20 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"We usually just call it ""ibhodwe elimnyama"" back where I live."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,shandu_ka_ndaba,6,Mon Jul 20 17:51:45 2015 UTC,"""Black (meat?) pot."" I assume that translates to stew in a pot? Awesome man, where is that you are from?"
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,quintinza,13,Mon Jul 20 17:55:51 2015 UTC,"Nope it just means black pot, the reason they are so called is that you kinda just put them over an open fire and they're notorious for being black from all the ash and soot. I live in Dundee KZN now, grew up in Nquthu though."
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,shandu_ka_ndaba,4,Mon Jul 20 18:04:03 2015 UTC,Cool stuff. Thanks hey.

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,RachelRTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:47 2015 UTC,Are you asking religion pantheons or a specific kind of ceremony?
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,shandu_ka_ndaba,3,Mon Jul 20 21:22:03 2015 UTC,That is cool. What kind of stuff do/did they make in it? Did they have the technology to make iron cauldrons before Europeans showed up?
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,phenomenomnom,5,Mon Jul 20 18:18:20 2015 UTC,Ask and you shall receive.
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,BobGeldof2nd,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:59:49 2015 UTC,"Hint: if they asked to ""have you over for dinner"", you were in trouble.   (Just kidding, as far as I know, the Zulu were not cannibals)"
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,gynoceros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:55 2015 UTC,How would they craft such a pot? I would be afraid I'd burn my pecker off.

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,longshot,0,Mon Jul 20 19:41:43 2015 UTC,Yeh man thats Afrikaans and Potje is also the Dutch word for little pot as Afrikaans developed from dutch.  Its a controversial language and some of my SA friends who are half other nationalities haven't been taught it on purpose due to its colonial connotations
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,Maasterix,4,Mon Jul 20 17:43:07 2015 UTC,"Afrikaans is not controversial in and of itself. It is classified as an African language (Afrika is Afrikaans for Africa) and it is also the youngest classified language in the world, becoming official only in 1925.  English is a colonial language over here, and Dutch and French as well. Afrikaans is local however, many of its roots my be in foreign languages (Dutch, German, French, Chinese, Malay and others) but a large part of its origin stems from local languages.  People who today lump Afrikaans in the colonial ball pit have a political ax to grind. Language of the old regime maybe along with English, but that ignores the work that Afrikaners have put in since 1994 to help rebuild the country."

HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,lazyfinger,8,Mon Jul 20 17:08:30 2015 UTC,Shouldn't they look more alike? Or were they not isolated
HistoryPorn,3dxvg8,Prufrock451,33,Mon Jul 20 16:45:00 2015 UTC,"The Zulus were actually a very large nation born of the union of many confederated tribes in the early 19th century. Under Shaka and successor kings, the Zulu incorporated many smaller nations, enforced the spread of uniform language, religion, and other customs, and conscripted or enslaved thousands from defeated nations.   The Zulu are therefore something of a melting pot, and Africa itself is a dizzyingly diverse place. All non-African humans are descended from a small initial population which crossed into Asia - there is more genetic diversity in Africa than between Africa and all other parts of the world."
