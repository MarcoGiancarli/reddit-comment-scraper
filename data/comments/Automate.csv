In engineering, of every one hundred who start, only fifty-five make it to a degree. The subject with the highest drop out rate in the UK is Computer science. In 2011 retail workers had a median age of 38, think about them or the 50 year old unemployed truck/taxi driver or the 26% of fast food workers with children training to become data scientists. Gaining an entirely new skill set isn't easy and is currently very expensive and time consuming.   2) Not every person has the desire or opportunities to study STEM subjects - the current trend is that women don’t want to study STEM subjects, only about a quarter of workers in STEM fields were women in 2011. Just 18% of computer and information sciences bachelor’s degree recipients were women in 2013. African-American and Latino workers also now represent 29 percent of the general workforce population, but just 16 percent of the advanced manufacturing workforce, 15 percent of the computing workforce and 12 percent of the engineering. workforce.   3) There is not enough STEM jobs for STEM graduates, the shortage of stem workers is a complete myth ""A compelling body of research  is now available, from many leading academic researchers and from respected research organizations, no one has been able to find any evidence indicating current widespread labor market shortages or hiring difficulties in science and engineering occupations that require bachelor's degrees or higher...All have concluded that U.S. higher education produces far more science and engineering graduates annually than there are S&E job openings—the only disagreement is whether it is 100 percent or 200 percent more."""

Electrical and electronic engineering has been heavily outsourced abroad, US employment in 2013 declined to about 300,000, down from about 385,000 in 2002. American high schoolers are dramatically trailing behind comparable countries — especially in Math.   ""There is a global race for STEM skills and other countries are heavily investing and increasing the supply of STEM students, 41% of all degrees awarded by Chinese institutions in 2011 were in a STEM subject, almost twice the proportion of STEM degrees awarded in the UK and three times the rate in the US. China now stands behind only the United States in the number of science and technology journals published annually, and is expected to overtake the US in scientific output within few years, according to a recent study by the Royal Society. By 2020, China expects to have nearly 195 million community college and university graduates — compared with no more than 120 million in the United States.  Accenture predicts that Brazil will increase its engineering graduates by 68% by 2015 and will produce more PhD engineers than the US by 2016."" A relatively highly educated workforce has been a traditional source of advantage, however, the rapid rise in global education means this historic strength is being eroded, the increasing numbers of highly educated people in the world will inevitably increase the international competition for the goods and services they produce.  Over the next decade more and more people will be collaboratively and flexibly working in the cloud without any fixed location a study by Intuit found.    A report by the Economist found as technology develops, however, it seems increasingly likely that the 20th-century construct of people trooping across a city to sit next to each other simply to do their job will come increasingly under question, as more flexible approaches emerge. As such, eight in ten executives agree that the working environment will become “virtual” thanks to more secure mobile technologies and cloud computing.

For many years getting an engineering degree was great for people who were not good at critical thinking but were great at memorization. People could walk out with a degree and earn lots of money and people thought this was the path to success: hard work, studying, passing hard math tests, and then earning lots of money.   It made a lot of sense.  And as for the critical thinkers, well they could stay in their mother's basement and write angry comments on news sites because their liberal arts degree isn't worth anything and their job at the call center went overseas.  But the thing about it is that those critical thinkers seen a very common trend emerging: honest, highly educated, STEM educated people getting screwed.  I mean you have an entire nation (China) that is unwilling to respect intellectual property rights. They are also willing to engage in human rights abuses to fight for the lowest wage and they'll do the engineering for free.  So anyone with a brain (critical thinkers) could see that its not going to last forever, and certainly not worth taking the long term risk in getting an engineering degree.  Obviously I don't want to paint with too large a brush, there are some specializations that are fairly protected. But overall, specialization poses a significant risk.  Generally it's more prudent to have a very wide scope of understanding and to have at least a shallow understanding in every topic. It's also very useful to be able to travel and be on foot in other countries, especially poor countries, because that is full of opportunities that an individual could exploit just like a corporation could exploit (corporations are people after all).  In other words, there are no simple answers to making money in the future. Business run governments are busy killing pensions and social benefits, the Chinese who have broken free from American control are just destroying intellectual property rights and hacking blue prints and formulas, etc.   I think it pays to have big picture thinking and an advanced general education. It's like looking at the ocean at that point, and once you become familiar with the tides and currents, it's fairly trivial to earn a living. Live by the sword, die by the sword.

All my time under 30 has been slated for learning. 30-60 will be for working. I've learned that investing in Filipino cows can be a very good investment.

Then I could have some sort of landscaping business in Canada for example. Then I could have an internet business run by Filipinos, and a forex operation, or trading digital currencies, or just hire information workers to help give me leads to work with. You have to be all over the place and think like a corporation, to maximize what is working and abandon quickly what isn't, but most of all have a lot of different things going at one time, because pensions and unions and all that sort of thing is going away, and wages are being lowered etc, so the idea is to get close to the land and the people and work on daily essentials, or when it's not essential (like a coffee) then hire low paid workers (like Filipinos) and low cost product (coffee), and perhaps get higher margins.   Or in short, how does a future looking BA degree should look like ?    One person linked something that said that 80% of jobs are going to be automated at some point.  What cannot be automated is the human brain.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education   The liberal arts (Latin: artes liberales) are those subjects or skills that in classical antiquity were considered essential for a free person (Latin: liberal, ""worthy of a free person"")   I want to be a free man.  The future looks how you will forge it to be. Yes there are some potential BA jobs, right now I think the average BA guy is earning 35k or so. But there is a huge campaign to lower wages in all sectors, so maybe that will go down to 30 or 25k eventually, over the course of X or XX amount of years, and the cost of living is not going down, and prices are going up, and social benefits are being cut, so it's nothing to be relied upon in the long term but something to consider for the short to medium term.  I am sorry if I sound like a raving maniac because it's very late here and I'm all over the place trying to cover a lot of topics. Like I said Noam Chomsky on Youtube, pretty much like taking the red pill on what the world is really like.

Automate,3di5nl,losningen,6,Thu Jul 16 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"combine the availability of tech to make everything for extremely cheap   This operates under the presumption that the world has infinite resources and is an infinite garbage can. You can 100% rest assured that if tech causes some huge surge in production like we seen in the industrial era, that could directly lead to WW3. Because at that point limited resources is going to become a much bigger factor, not so much when humans are involved and the scale is much smaller.  Automation could conceivably lead to projects like a ""nuclear shield"" or other very large scale attempts to gain leverage in the global theater of domination. Players like Russia will fall behind in the automation game and potentially be forced to act early on with aggression, since they are a huge target and have enormous resources.   the example of a few countries like the nordic who will succeed in giving their people good lives on basic income   No doubt that their socialism is the envy of civilized people, however corporatism just completely ignores this, both companies and citizens of the US alike are perfectly willing to let human rights abuses slide for slightly cheaper prices. As long as suffering is out of their view, American's don't care too much. But what happens when the Americans start suffering, is the real question. Who will be in charge then? The corporations.    and the assumption that elections will still be a thing   Elections are already meaningless. Less than 50% of people vote. If polled (they are never polled), they tend to have very socialist views. In a western nation like Canada, which has 3 parties, the socialist party is set to win the October 2015 elections if it hold steady. This option does not exist in the US because it has always been violent to the labor movement and socialist parties in general. As a result, people just don't even vote because they don't have anyone that represents their views.  It's already a business run society.   i can see it heading towards basic income - probably after some period of serious suffering.    This is like saying that the white slave masters in the South will eventually grant freedom to the blacks after a period of serious suffering. They just ""need to stimulate the economy"", eventually the wealth will be enough that everything will be fine. It doesn't really work like that, in this system wealth concentrates at the top in an irrational way. Children are already starving in schools and that disparity is represented by a couple of ounces of gold laying in a vault somewhere. It doesn't have to make sense, that's the point, even after automation it is likely that ridiculous wealth will continue to go to the top and lead to unnecessary suffering at the bottom, it's because it's a class war. The bottom classes (including the middle classes) are made to suffer so that they will not question the few sparse benefits that they are given, lest they be taken away. They are taught to fight for themselves and not work together. This is already happening in our society, and has been since WW2.  In short, a social democratic revolution is needed before automation turns out well. Failure to do so will result in a totalitarian plutocratic state as we have now. The outcome of that will be horrendous, look how aggressive NATO is now and mineral and gas prices are at an all time low."

When a globalist is thinking of a use for the technology then it will be based on entirely replacing skilled workers.

Here is is actually solving a problem in ways that benefit everyone. And actually these are the solutions that you are going to see less of because there is less emphasis on this sort of thing.   This is where the emphasis should be placed, on worker aids which helped skilled labor and also conserve energy and help preserve the environment.
