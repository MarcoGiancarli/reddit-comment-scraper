KansasCityChiefs,3dz1mg,JaquiskiTaterTartt,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:00 2015 UTC,Weaknesses: Big athletic receivers.  Receivers who are 6’3″ and above are always so hard to stop in Madden.  It is good that the Chiefs have speed everywhere but there will come a time when you need a big and strong receiver to make a spectacular catch and the Chiefs don’t really have a guy like that.   travis kelce?

Then he traded down.  OK, so we've got the 26th pick & he's still there. Take him now. It's just weed, he's not going to last much longer and somebody's going to get him if we don't. I was so pissed when we took Baldwin. Everyone in the room told me to ""calm down, Houston is an idiot cause he smoked weed and we have Hali anyway.""  Then we got him 2 rounds later anyway and now Pioli's gone. Houston is a much better parting gift than clean stairwells.  In short, fuck you, Pioli."

KansasCityChiefs,3dr156,donottakethisserious,4,Sat Jul 18 22:08:03 2015 UTC,"Knocking players for being unable to pass a drug test is just another way to weed out stupid players who get in trouble for stupid reasons.  In the NFL, they test for weed once a year, the players know when it will be, and every year multiple players fail. The prohibition doesn't even matter at that point, if it wasn't weed it would be forgetting what time the team bus leaves."

KansasCityChiefs,3dm02p,oberstofsunshine,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:22:16 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but Sean Smith is the only big contract we will need to worry about next offseason
KansasCityChiefs,3dm02p,CbOaCcKh,3,Fri Jul 17 16:54:36 2015 UTC,"DJ, Tamba, Tyvon Branch, Abdullah and Eric Berry as well.   But we also have Poe, Kelce and Albert Wilson (Eric Fisher if they don't use his 5th year option) in 2017."
KansasCityChiefs,3dm02p,TheVetNoob,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"Well that is quite a few players but I think it's certainly doable to keep the majority of them. DJ, Tamba, and Berry will be relatively cheap. Abdullah would probably get a deal close to Ron Parkers. I don't think the resign Branch as I think if he plays well enough to get a big contract he will look to cash in elsewhere and if he plays poorly he is gone."
KansasCityChiefs,3dm02p,CbOaCcKh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:14:36 2015 UTC,They drafted Peters to replace him (I think)

Poe and Kelce are under contract through 2016, Berry, Tamba, DJ, Abdullah, and Fisher (if he continues playing at the same level) wouldn't command huge numbers. Smith is the only one I can think that will get a large payday."

KansasCityChiefs,3dm02p,Nurlitik,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:38 2015 UTC,"Well it was his own fault he was a 3rd pick, so he really screwed himself out of money on his rookie contract  Edit: he was widely considered to be a high first round pick but he failed a combine drug test and dropped to the third round. The contract difference between a first round pick and a third is significant. Not understanding the downvotes."

That's why it's hard to truly compare WR's, but let's not fool ourselves, Denver locked up an elite player just like we did."

KansasCityChiefs,3dl024,caseywheat,4,Fri Jul 17 05:50:18 2015 UTC,Houston had the most pressures in the league by far so i would say he is a better pass rusher.
KansasCityChiefs,3dl024,WallyReflector,4,Fri Jul 17 07:49:39 2015 UTC,While not playing on the line every play like Watt does
KansasCityChiefs,3dl024,CbOaCcKh,-1,Fri Jul 17 11:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, Houston is a great player. I think he will remain that way for years to come.   In a salary cap league though, you just  can't win with contracts like that. More players like Hudson will walk because we don't have the money to pay them unless the cap jumps up a lot more."
KansasCityChiefs,3diyey,cowhisperer,3,Thu Jul 16 17:25:23 2015 UTC,Some one hire a moving company for this man!
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,Direckshun,13,Thu Jul 16 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"I really don't see either of those 2 moves as disastrous. While it would have been nice to keep Hudson, the amount of money he wanted after just 1 good year is ridiculous. Grabbing Morse in the 2nd may have been a reach but it was far from a disastrous decision."
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,CbOaCcKh,8,Thu Jul 16 19:19:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I would have been alright with Fasano still being on the team, and there was no way we were going to pay Hudson what he got, so I wouldn't really call that a disastrous move."
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,cowhisperer,5,Thu Jul 16 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"You really can't say that grabbing Morse in the 2nd was a disaster. You can't even call it a bad move.  When are people going to learn that you can't judge a draft picks before they play? Every player from every round is a crap shoot and nobody ever gets their analysis right, especially not the fans."
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,shazwazzle,3,Thu Jul 16 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"Rodney Hudson :(, that one hurt the most"
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,NetGypsy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right, but this is all feeling like shades of the '98 pre-season to me.  After the heartbreaking playoff loss to Denver in '97, we kept most of our key players in the offseason and upgraded (we thought) at a few key positions.  After going 13-3, people were legitimately talking about 16-0 being at least in the realm of possibility.  A great team got even better.    Though the Internet wasn't really around then (for all practical purposes), I heard this sort of buzz - the kind you're posting - all the time from people.  And don't get me wrong - I hope you're right this time around.  But every time I see someone talking about how great this year's team is gonna be - either here on Reddit, in face to face conversations with friends, or even on ESPN where a lot of them are giving us props...  ...All I can think of is this is exactly how we felt going into the '98 season.  The wheels fell off that year and the team was incredibly undisciplined."

KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,Philo_T_Farnsworth,2,Fri Jul 17 17:22:04 2015 UTC,You can't judge draft picks before the season even starts. Morse could be the next Will Shields for all we know.
KansasCityChiefs,3diwfj,eeegs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:12:22 2015 UTC,It's even better than you think. Delete that Disastrous line for sure. Hudson certainly was a big loss but for the money wouldn't have been a good move.   I like the Morse kid and though I may be wrong is to early to tell.
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,redd2kx,63,Wed Jul 15 15:59:40 2015 UTC,Wow.  Kansas City spent money on a good player?
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,RJMaestro,19,Wed Jul 15 16:00:49 2015 UTC,"That was exactly my thought. If this were the Peterson or Pioli regime, he'd be long gone if that was the price for him (obviously cheaper then but you get the point). Great deal all around and we get a pro bowler for six more years."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,Random_Derp_Guy,6,Wed Jul 15 16:08:18 2015 UTC,There is no way he plays all 6 years.

KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,freewheelinCW,4,Wed Jul 15 17:13:05 2015 UTC,Most likely meant that he'll restructure in 3 or 4.

KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,justplainjeremy,3,Wed Jul 15 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Just think about the last decade or so of huge contracts. Now think about how many of those players were still at that elite level 3, 4, or 5 years later.  These big deals never make it all the way through, which is why guaranteed money is so crucial."

KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,hook_killed_pan,12,Wed Jul 15 18:55:36 2015 UTC,ALL PRAISE DORSEY! LONG MAY HE REIGN!
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,InvaderChin,7,Wed Jul 15 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"On a personal note, I spent ~$250 on an elite Justin Houston jersey last year, and now it looks like I will be getting a return on my investment.  As a fan, I'm estatic he is coming back long-term.  As a stingy consumer, I am glad that I don't have to replace that expensive purchase after just 16 games."

KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,hookem101horns,45,Thu Jul 16 02:24:53 2015 UTC,"Let this soak in for a moment.    We have Charles, Smith, Maclin, and Houston locked up long term now with a huge amount of cap space coming open next year and even more the year after.  We have plenty of money to re-sign Poe and due to back filled with young talent instead of free agents elsewhere, we are in absolutely fantastic shape for the coming years.    If you aren't excited about the next few years, you are being way to pessimistic and aren't truly paying attention to what Dorsey has been doing."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,materhern,16,Wed Jul 15 16:14:05 2015 UTC,"From what I see at overthecap.com, next year's notable free agents are: Eric Berry, Derrick Johnson, Sean Smith, Chase Daniel, Mike Devito, Jeff Allen, Husain Abdullah.  We were projected to have 46 million in cap space next year before the Justin Houston contract.  The cap hit for Houston's contract could be anywhere form 16-22 mil next year, so that leaves about 24-30 million left over in cap for next year.  We probably won't keep Chase Daniel after this year as hopefully Aaron Murray steps up as a backup QB next year.  Sean Smith is most likely gone if Marcus Peters shows that he is indeed worthy of a first round pick.  I have no idea what happens to Eric Berry's contract with what he is going through right now.  That leaves us with DJ, Devito, Allen and Abdullah, who all probably won't require a ton of money to re-sign.  The cap situation and team roster looks pretty good for next year."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,makun,6,Wed Jul 15 17:03:18 2015 UTC,Personally I see DJ taking less next year.  He's getting up there and coming off injury.  Unless he has a monster year and has something like 120 tackles.

We have easily enough money next year to resign Poe so both will be locked up.  With how dirt cheap our secondary can be with all our young players, it's a no brainer really."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,IIHURRlCANEII,6,Wed Jul 15 16:05:30 2015 UTC,"Ummm, no.  NT is still the most important position on a 34 defense.  Not too many 6-3 340 LB guys that can run a sub 5 40 and run sideline to sideline."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,Da_Zou13,4,Wed Jul 15 16:32:31 2015 UTC,Are you actually telling me that you'd rather have Dontari Poe than Justin Houston?
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,TheVetNoob,14,Wed Jul 15 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"I'll defend that argument, and not only because Poe is my favorite player in the NFL right now.   A NT like Poe is rarer than a OLB like Houston. I am in no way knocking Houston, but there are enough other options out there that can produce closer to his level than there are NT's out there that can produce like Poe can.   Houston is so good that I understand if you would rather have him than Dontari, and I'm fucking pumped that we have both. I am so excited heading into this season baby! RIPieces Manning, KC 2015-16 AFC West Champs here we come!"
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,freewheelinCW,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"A NT like Poe is rarer than a OLB like Houston   A NT like Poe who can rush the passer and stop the run is rare, but any edge rusher who can get 22 sacks is far more coveted."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,TheVetNoob,4,Wed Jul 15 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"It's not even that. Poe's body type is not something that can be taught. There aren't a lot of players that are built to be nose tackles, and even less that have the skill. Poe has a specialized role that can only be filled by a select number of people."
KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,Penderdragon,2,Wed Jul 15 23:27:41 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, Im telling you that a 34 defense starts with the NT and then is build around that.  Pass rushers are obviously very important, but you have to have an anchor in the middle of the line that demands double teams every play.    Honestly, if I was forced to choose between Houston or Poe for the next 6 years, Im taking Poe.  Every single draft there are a handful of 1st round pass rushers that fit a 34 while a guy like Poe only comes around once every few years (if that)."

KansasCityChiefs,3de6qd,TheVetNoob,2,Wed Jul 15 21:11:59 2015 UTC,I get what youre saying and agree with you that most will never be any good let alone anywhere close to Houston.

Who do we need to re-sign next year?  Sean Smith, Eric Berry, Dontari Poe (Optioned at $6m for 2016 so not necessary)...?"

KansasCityChiefs,3d5fn1,Wild_Bill_Kickcock,3,Mon Jul 13 23:33:46 2015 UTC,I think it's more about the uncertainty that him playing on the tag will bring than anything else. If we sign him to a deal there is no question whether he will play or be a Chief in the future.
KansasCityChiefs,3d5fn1,cowhisperer,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:38 2015 UTC,"I still think it's unreasonable. It is $13.2 million franchise tag this year, and if you still don't get a deal done, you tag him again next year at 120% of this years value, which would be $15.8 million, which is about what his contract average will be for anyway.

He had the athleticism to be a sideline-to-sideline interception threat as well as tackler. He should have been the Chiefs' version of Troy Polamalu or Ed Reed but perhaps not as much of a consistent pass defense threat.. But Romeo turned him in to an undersized linebacker that isn't in a position to be (hate to use the cliche) but ballhawk that also provides run support.

He didn't play his first year at KU for some really bizarre reasons that the NCAA still hasn't clarified.  He was academically eligible by their standards, but they deemed him ineligible because they felt he needed a year to focus on his school work.  He may be raw, but he's talented.  He'll make a push and is really a no risk pick up for the front office.  Edit - he's 6'2 195 with 4.4 speed.  He has the tools.  If he can learn the system quickly or at least show some flashes, the Chiefs might store him on the practice squad."

KansasCityChiefs,3cpqu6,Jakedubbleya,7,Thu Jul 9 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think this sub is so ridiculously negative sided that anyone saying they might be good will get downvoted into oblivion.  Seriously, just step back and look at the expectations.    PFF ranked us 27th overall.  22nd in run blocking.    We've upgraded our weakest position, left guard.  Almost every ranking had LG as one of the main reasons for Fishers poor ranking.  We didn't just upgrade, we picked up a guy one year removed from multiple pro-bowls.    Injuries hampered the right side last year.  We have healthy people back.  Question mark is at center, we have no idea what it will be like.    So when I see people ranking us worse, or the same as last year, I have to wonder what the fuck you are looking at.  A good center CAN NOT make up for a bad left side.  However, a good left side can make up for a bad Center.  Or even an inexperienced Center when we are talking about having a probowler to his left.  Grubbs literally makes the entire line better by his experience at the position.  And it happens immediately.    The right side, by virtue of starting healthy, is already immediately better.  Allen and Stephenson are solid.  One of them will start at RT.  Zach Fulton, who everyone seems to forget about, was actually solid at right guard by end of season.  And that was his rookie year!   I predict this line is no better than 12th in the league, but no worse than 20th.  There is no way in fucking hell this line is worse than last year.  Period.  Not gonna happen.  The doom and gloom is not backed up by common sense or numbers and really needs to stop."
KansasCityChiefs,3cpqu6,materhern,3,Fri Jul 10 12:00:45 2015 UTC,"I expect we'll lineup Fisher-Grubbs-Kush-Morse-Stephenson. It's a make or break year for Fisher, but either way I expect he'll be average at the very least. Grubbs should be slightly above average but a huge upgrade at the position. I've been hearing lots of good things about Kush and he looks shredded so I'm expecting him to be average at least. People say that him not playing last year is a sign he is that good, but I'm hoping that Andy just didn't want to move him to guard and mess up his progress at center. I expect RG TO BE Morse and we are yet to see how he does at the pro level, but I'm optimistic because of how GB drafted tackles to play guard and Dorsey should be experienced with that. Stephenson worries me most as he's got significant snaps all 3 years but he hasn't cemented himself in the team. I wish we had addressed the line more in the draft, but only time will tell how we do."
KansasCityChiefs,3cpqu6,Coys11,-14,Thu Jul 9 21:31:06 2015 UTC,How is fisher still even an option. He wasn't d1 material. Get his ass off the fucking line.  So sad to have all this hope elsewhere and we know it doesn't matter because our line is literally a joke.

KansasCityChiefs,3cpqu6,TheVetNoob,-2,Thu Jul 9 21:46:08 2015 UTC,It's not going to be any better than last year. Grubbs is a lateral exchange with Hudson at best. Center is going to be a shitshow with a guy that couldn't crack what was said to be the worst OL lineup last year at any spot in Kush or a rookie reach pick that can't actually execute a shotgun snap in Morse.  RG and RT are complete question marks as well.  Expect lots and lots of sacks and stuffed runs this year.

I know a lot of people don't like him, even within our fan base and I often find myself defending him for being called a check down specialist or game manager. To be honest, I'm fine with either if we're winning games and he's not throwing INT's after going through Matt Cassel.  I feel like this year is his year to show whether or not he is more than a game manager or check down specialist with Maclin and Kelce as weapons and hopefully Wilson and Conley as well. I have really high hopes for this season and I'm predicting either Chiefs v Packers or Chiefs v Cowboys for the Superbowl."

The Chiefs will have lots of money to work with next year, so the likelihood of Houston getting a new contract is more likely then. But, you never know what could happen."
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,tashedmesticles,4,Sun Jul 5 18:17:33 2015 UTC,Unless he refuses to play. Which might actually be a good sign. It'd mean he'd want to stay in KC on a good contract. If he wanted to leave he'd just play out his tag and try to impress other teams. Skipping games would only hurt his stock to other teams
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,chiefsfan71308,2,Sun Jul 5 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Skipping games protects him from an injury that will absolutely hurt his stock.  Hell, playing on 12 games only really has good consequences for him as a player as long as he is willing to forgo 4 game checks.  If he plays those first 4 weeks and gets injured, and misses more than 4 weeks, then he has definitely hurt his stock for next year, and the severity will changed based on what the injury is.  If he opts out of 4 games and still has a good 12 game year, teams will realize it was a smaller sample size, so he still makes his money and protects his body while he is at it.  He will only play if his love for the game is greater than his love for money.  I don't blame him hunting the dollars, OLB have pretty short careers in the grand scheme of things.  Him skipping games doesn't prove he wants to be a Chief, it proves he wants the damn contract he earned and he has no other recourse but to sit on the bench."

KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Morn1ngThund3r,4,Tue Jul 7 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"There is no chance they get a deal done.  They aren't willing to pay him what he wants.  That has been true for 2 years now, and he just went and tied the franchise season record for sacks, so I can only imagine he wants more.  At this point, I think they are happy with the roster they have.  The only benefit to signing Houston this year from the FO's perspective is that his cap hit now will go down from 13 million to probably half that since they can cover the rest with a signing bonus.  If they don't need 6 or 7 million right now, they have no reason to sign Houston to the long term deal he wants (something in the '55 million guaranteed, 100+ mill over 5 year range').    This might change next year, it depends on how he plays.  If he gets hurt, I bet he tells the Chiefs to suck eggs and goes and gets his money elsewhere, since it will be less than what he could have gotten this year.  If he plays as well or better than last year, his asking price will go up, and the Chiefs will have to pony up or watch him walk.  Every time this comes up, it seems more and more like Dorsey is going to let him go and make stupid money for someone else, just like the Lions did with Suh last year."
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Micori,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:03:38 2015 UTC,That would be an absurd contract.
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Kaveman44,2,Sun Jul 5 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"It's what he wants.  Watt got 6 years, 100 mil, 51 gtd in 2014.  With the cap hike and the fact that Houston is arguably as disruptive as Watt, are those numbers that insane?    Edit: Suh just got 6 years, 114 mil, 59 gtd.  No way Houston gets that much, but the precedent for front 7 guys is getting huge."
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Micori,3,Sun Jul 5 22:06:19 2015 UTC,If he wants that much and refuses a more reasonable contract I hope they don't sign him.

It's pretty rare. Many have skipped training camp or came at the end and then had great seasons. I think if a deal was going to be done it would have been done by now. I think he skips all or most of all of training camp, but plays every game this season. After the season is over he signs his long term contract. I'm sure he wants big money now but I think the Chiefs are probably telling him next offseason they have the money and he needs to wait one more season."

KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,busterbrown017,-1,Sun Jul 5 18:07:57 2015 UTC,Yes but I think he misses all the pre-season games and maybe one or two regular season games.
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Micori,2,Sun Jul 5 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"He has to sign a long term deal by the middle of July.  If he doesn't no one can negotiate with him about a long term deal until the end of the regular season.  What you have stated is impossible unless we sign him now, and then he skips games while on a long contract."
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,busterbrown017,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:26:49 2015 UTC,I knew no one could negotiate after the date but I don't think that stops him from refusing to play right? What stops him from continuing to hold out to try and get more money at the end of the year negotiations.
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,Micori,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"What leverage does it give him next year to hold out one game this year?  He will either skip 4 or skip 0.  Holding out during the regular season has one practical advantage for Houston: he won't get hurt if he isn't on the field.  Other than that, it is all negatives: he loses 4 paychecks, his stats will be lower (though I think teams will still value him the same as long as he does well over the other 12), and he sours his relationship with the FO in KC which already has tensions in it.  Skipping one game doesn't prove anything and it still leaves him with 15 games to get injured in.  He won't get more money because he showed he can sit at home."
KansasCityChiefs,3c7aks,busterbrown017,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:58 2015 UTC,That's true. All of those are really good points. I wonder if he is really worried about getting hurt without a long term contract or that's just an excuse to hold out.

KansasCityChiefs,3c577q,Green89,3,Sat Jul 4 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  I'm not sure if this counts as a self-post, but if it does I apologise, and feel free to remove it right away. The main reason I'm posting this here is because I'm actually a Georgia State Panthers fan, and so I watched Albert Wilson play in college. He was way too good for us in all honesty, considering we only got our first ever win as a D1 team this season.  You guys got an incredibly hard worker with loads of ability when you picked him up, which you saw for yourselves this season. He's my favourite non-Charger, and I was desperate for him to get a chance to show what he can do.  As far as predictions for this season, how do you guys feel about him? I wouldn't be surprised to see him turn into one of your most crucial players on offense, and you could actually have a really good passing game with Kelce, Maclin and Wilson, as well as Conley/DAT if he makes the swap.  Are there any other players you guys are expecting to break out this year (or, if you don't rate Wilson, why?) I don't really hear much about the lesser known Chiefs players outside of WR, and I get the sense that Hammond and Hemmingway aren't exactly well liked by Chiefs fans."
KansasCityChiefs,3c577q,thefross,6,Sat Jul 4 22:22:39 2015 UTC,Fuck Junior Hemingway. My least favourite player on the Chiefs

Also Conley will have the ability to stretch the field too, I could see Wilson being very productive in this offense next year."

KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,Van_Houten,4,Sat Jul 4 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"This analysis is not nearly thorough enough. It poses the question ""Why is Justin Houston so good?"" and then gives ""hand fighting"" as the answer? Hand fighting isn't special. If all he could do was hand fight, Houston would not be nearly as good as he is.  What makes Houston good is that he is excellent at all facets of pass-rushing. He has technique, like hand fighting, that can beat you, he has the strength to bull rush you, and has the speed to just blow past you.  What makes Houston great is that he is very good at everything he is asked to do, he's a danger in any game situation. He is one of the best pass rushers in the game right now, one of the better run defenders on our defense, and he isn't a big liability when asked to drop into coverage.  This analysis would be more accurately titled ""a few pictures of Justin Houston's handfighting""."
KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,TheRiz89,6,Sat Jul 4 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Hand fighting really separates pass rushers in the NFL.  Look at Tamba, never had elite(or even great) athleticism but works like hell to keep adjusting how he uses his hands.  Every year there are multiple pure speed rushers in the NFL people fall in love with due to their athleticism/speed.. but they don't pan out because they can not use their hands(which is needed to adjust to from speed to power).  Yes Houston can do it all, and is by far the best OLB in the league.  He is the best run defending edge in the league, not a liability in pass coverage, and a beast against the passer."
KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,YoYoYo1111,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that hand fighting is incredibly important, but the article here doesn't even acknowledge the other aspects of Houston's game! I feel like this article is implying that the only thing that makes Houston great is his hand fighting, but that's not true. If all Houston had was great hand fighting skills, he would be another Tamba Hali (which I would not complain about at all)"
KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,TheRiz89,3,Sat Jul 4 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"I kind of think the article does mention those things...which is why I posted it. I think there's only so much you can say about someone being fast or quick or explosive, which are all things acknowledged in the article. ""Yes, the athleticism is a factor. The power and explosiveness are definitely factors too. He gets low and plays with great leverage. He can bull rush and drive a tackle 60 pounds heavier than him back into the quarterback. He can dip his shoulder around the edge and win with speed. However, it’s how he uses his hands that separates him."""
KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,YoYoYo1111,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"He would still end up being better than Tamba, if both had great hand fighting, due to the athleticism.  Yes the article was skimpy but Houston will always get more 'credit' for the sack #s over being stout against the run/in coverage."
KansasCityChiefs,3c3p61,CaptainRatTrap,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:43:42 2015 UTC,I think it's because the Chiefs play man coverage on defense quite a bit which I love. 9/10 he's a better athlete then who is trying to contain him. He's awesome

KansasCityChiefs,3bwmhr,Arwizzel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:34:26 2015 UTC,"The Alex Smith ""Deep Ball"" Myth [3:10]   Many people believe in the myth of Alex Smith being unable to throw the deep ball. They say he can't throw the ball more than 20 yards down the field. In today's day and age where people have become obsessed with high powered offenses, big plays, and fantasy football statistics, quarterbacks like Alex Smith are overlooked. When you have a good running game and a solid defense (aka TEAM football), throwing the ball down field all game isn't necessary. Joe Montana wasn't a big time deep ball thrower yet some consider him to be the greatest QB of all time. Why? Because fantasy football wasn't around in the 1980's. Alex Smith knows how to not lose football games by making the correct reads, getting his playmakers the ball, and controlling the game... but if his team needs him to start slinging the ball late in the 4th quarter, he is more than capable of doing that. Chiefs fans have learned what Smith can do when he's forced to throw down field after their defense got shredded by Peyton Manning and Phillip Rivers.

KansasCityChiefs,3bwmhr,youtubefactsbot,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"I can't forsee this going well for you...  .. but yeah, any article that purports ""hidden points"" is just nonsense. Sure, Smith won't turn the ball over and can generally sustain long drives but when the situation calls for a quick downfield attack, it doesn't happen. Outside of 49ers/Saints playoff game, it never happens.  What the Chiefs get with Smith at QB isn't all that much better than what they could get with Chase Daniel under center. Daniel's not a starter, no, but he brings 75% of Smith's game to the table as we've seen with both of his starts against the Chargers."

My brother got so mad he kicked the seat in front of us and accidentally sent the back of it sailing about 10 rows.

Around 10 AM the north wind started to blow and it was like someone opened an air conditioner vent. Cold, cold north wind. Temperature dropped into the 30's by game time with wind chill easily in the low 20's. Still, it's all good because we're up 21-10 headed into the 4th quarter. We're freezing but it's all good. Then Phillip Rivers, who usually sucks at Arrowhead, throws two touchdown passes, both two point extra point attempts fail but now they're up 22-21. Thigpen is the QB and he can do NOTHING. Larry Johnson only runs for 55 yards and acts like he's done in the 4th quarter, game over. Chiefs lose. Long, cold walk back to the car. That sucked. This is now our benchmark for when the weather sucks: could be worse, could be the San Diego game!"

I get in I have great seats, things are going well...until Brodie Croyle and the offense take the field....they got shut out, ZERO POINTS! I was so close to the field I shouted ....""we believed in u Brodie, how could u do this to us!""...he hung his head, he heard! He never started another game after that certainly not after that season. I feel a little responsible 😏 👋"

Both teams were terrible and the announcer said something to the effect of ""we always say its difficult to win a game in the nfl, well for these teams they're fighting to lose."" and ""this game tape needs to be taken and burned.""   Nothing was really riding on the game, just very emblematic of how awful we were during those years and how desolate it felt."

KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,NFLVideoConverterBot,8,Thu Jul 2 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Raiders fan here. Saw this post and just wanted to say how much I respect Jamaal Charles and love watching him play, even if it's against us."
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,Vancityy,8,Thu Jul 2 15:37:07 2015 UTC,I love watching him play against you too!
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,mizzourifan1,3,Thu Jul 2 16:05:07 2015 UTC,I just love watching him play.
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,tizzix,3,Thu Jul 2 17:31:52 2015 UTC,What the hell does the guy say at the beginning of the video?  I tried watching it 4-5 times and can't figure it out.
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,tonygenius,3,Thu Jul 2 17:06:46 2015 UTC,"Sound to me like ""so your comeback is: you go out there and tackle him. That's how good Jamaal Charles is."" It would probably make more sense if there was any context to the statement."
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,CbOaCcKh,3,Thu Jul 2 18:59:40 2015 UTC,He's saying that the only game plan adjustment (comeback) against him is to tackle him. In other words he has no weakness.
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,NorthWoods16,2,Thu Jul 2 22:35:10 2015 UTC,"Got it, I guess I needed to know what he meant by comeback.    Thanks homie."

KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,Trident_Fork,6,Thu Jul 2 04:48:08 2015 UTC,Yeah doesn't make sense to me. I think Marshawn Lynch will be in the top ten and Jamaal won't be.
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,Trident_Fork,5,Thu Jul 2 05:01:45 2015 UTC,"Just going off of memory here but I'm pretty sure Lynch had a few more games to make his case than Charles did, so it seems appropriate based on the season."
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,fett4evr,2,Thu Jul 2 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"Oh very true and they wouldn't have won the nfc championship without him leading them through that game either. But I was also under the impression that it's rating the players for next season as well which you could argue now that Charles is healthier, we have a better line, and more threats on the field, that we will see Charles be able to produce more. I just feel like Chiefs players have been very overlooked in the top 100, like Houston at 27."
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,tizzix,5,Thu Jul 2 05:18:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, well if it is looking to next season you certainly aren't wrong. Also Houston at 27 is a damn problem"
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,fett4evr,4,Thu Jul 2 05:27:50 2015 UTC,Jamaal should be in the top 10.
KansasCityChiefs,3bttca,YoYoYo1111,3,Thu Jul 2 05:15:20 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to admit it,  this is a small market team.  Our phenomenal players are overlooked for the bigger cities' players like Seattle's and so on."
KansasCityChiefs,3bsm7v,KC_Stats,3,Wed Jul 1 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"I think Chiefs fans are going to be disappointed if those are the numbers they're expecting from Alex. I agree that he should be at his best this season, but 500 yards and a few TDs above his career best is a tough number to live up to. I also think the mean of each skill position player is reachable, but pretty close to a best case scenario on each, so most will fall just a little short and a few will fall a lot short.  But hey, it's a good survey, thanks for putting it together, KC_Stats!"
KansasCityChiefs,3bsm7v,KuatoBaradaNikto,3,Wed Jul 1 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, there is definitely plenty of hype going into this season. I'm not sure that it is unreasonable to imagine Alex at 3,800 yards this season. He was at 3,265 and 3,313 yards the last two seasons while only playing 15 games each season, and he averaged 220ish yards per game both years. So, we really are only talking about a 300ish yard increase over the whole year (assuming he plays all 16 games). With regards to touchdowns... I'm thinking you are right, and we over predicted that stat.   And thank you! It was fun to put together. If only we had more responses! I was thinking about putting together a defensive projection as well if there was enough interest."
KansasCityChiefs,3bsm7v,Jakedubbleya,2,Thu Jul 2 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"Heh, both Alex's max yardage and TDs are me.  YOU'LL SEE!!!"
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,GGPapoon,10,Wed Jul 1 12:56:55 2015 UTC,"Do they not do this every year? I'm not a season ticket holder, I just kinda thought they did this at the beginning of each year any way."
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,materhern,9,Wed Jul 1 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"No, they usually wait until it looks like the playoffs are a possibility. Most often that's late November/December. This is the first time they've done this in July!"

KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,polaroidgeek,10,Wed Jul 1 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"Clearly this is simply to inform ticket holders of policy regarding tickets for playoff games, should Arrowhead host them.  Your title is pure clickbait and you fucking know it."
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,CptJustice,3,Wed Jul 1 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that this is a bit of clickbait, as the email clearly states this is league-wide mandated and not team-specific, but it's still pretty cool. I'll probably be signing up shortly myself, just in case."

KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,discussthrower_,2,Wed Jul 1 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"Same here, I've been thinking about it since the last time we were in one."
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,skinnerq,2,Wed Jul 1 19:35:25 2015 UTC,So.. you have to put money down for tickets that aren't guaranteed and you can't get that money back unless you parlay them into season tickets for next year?  The NFL really is desperate for cash aren't they?
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,SHOW_ME_PIZZA,2,Wed Jul 1 18:17:50 2015 UTC,"Depends on the team. The Chiefs have a ""pay as we play"" option so you don't have to give money until the tickets are actually issued."
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,firematt422,2,Wed Jul 1 20:00:21 2015 UTC,Not just a January game a January win pls.
KansasCityChiefs,3bqxx8,Tanked88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:43:59 2015 UTC,The NFL has instructed teams to provide their Season Ticket Members the ability to reserve postseason tickets prior to the start of the season.

This is what I am most excited to see next season. I want to see Alex Smith take more shots downfield. We know he is capable of doing it, and now he has someone he can trust, and he knows it. For me, this season is critical for Smith. If Smith is capable of taking us to a Super Bowl, we need to see more production from him this season, and now he doesn't have any excuses."
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,materhern,7,Tue Jun 30 19:00:33 2015 UTC,How many times did we say that Alex Smith just needs to be able to trust that his WR isn't going to drop it or give up an interception? I can't wait to see what happens this year!
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,SHOW_ME_PIZZA,7,Tue Jun 30 19:41:04 2015 UTC,Number 1 reason I've been aboard the Jeremy Maclin hype train even before we picked him up.

KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,JMCSD,6,Wed Jul 1 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"As a somewhat un-knowledeable fan all things considered, you think Smith is better than Green?  Sincere question."
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,cowhisperer,6,Wed Jul 1 03:29:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, because he 'went out with a whimper,' people tend to forget about him, but the dude was really, really good at his job prior to the concussions."
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,countrybreakfast1,3,Wed Jul 1 13:26:09 2015 UTC,I'd say no
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,chiefsfan71308,3,Wed Jul 1 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"I would say no, but it is hard to compare. I think if Smith had the O-line that Green had there would be no comparison. Although Green did know how to throw a block. Watching him level linebackers was one of my favorite things about watching Green play."
KansasCityChiefs,3bnwec,mtravisrose,3,Wed Jul 1 16:01:43 2015 UTC,Yeah it's tough to compare when one played behind a group of HoF candidates and one plays behind horseshit
KansasCityChiefs,3bmzy4,cantuseaflairgoKC,7,Tue Jun 30 15:05:04 2015 UTC,Boom.  I think he'll end up being the steal of the draft.  No foundation for that opinion beyond blind faith in Dorsey.

KansasCityChiefs,3bmzy4,jeffp12,5,Wed Jul 1 03:17:16 2015 UTC,He adds physical corner play and physical talent to an already solid CB squad. It was a BPA pick and I personally fell in love with it. Shortly into the season it'll be him and Smith on the outside with Gaines playing nickel.
KansasCityChiefs,3bmzy4,bradasskg,4,Tue Jun 30 17:20:37 2015 UTC,What? Nobody can give any knowledgeable info besides guessing. Unless that's what you're looking for and I'm missing something here.

KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,KC_Stats,3,Mon Jun 29 20:59:04 2015 UTC,You honestly need to add Anthony Sherman into the mix.  Even if he only had 1 TD in 2013 and 2014 we still use him in goal line situations and thats 1 more TD than our receiving corp combined last year.  Plus you are leaving off Demetrius Harris who I think will see more looks this year if he can stay healthy.
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,kloiberin_time,4,Tue Jun 30 09:51:24 2015 UTC,How many different WRs will have a TD reception?
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,Svenray,-2,Mon Jun 29 23:50:47 2015 UTC,"I feel pretty confident predicting zero, considering holy shit we just went a whole season without one.  I hate being this pessimistic. I love the chiefs. But I am of little faith."
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,GragasInRealLife,4,Tue Jun 30 06:17:45 2015 UTC,"Not going to happen.  Last year was a statistical miracle.  It required one of the worst lines in football and the worst receiving corp as well as multiple fluke fumbles and a few times where guys like Fasano jumped for a ball meant for someone else and ""stole"" the TD from our receivers.  Our wideouts are so much better this year.  Maclin will be good for a few just burner TDs, where he catches the ball 5 or 10 yards out and turns on the afterburners for 60 yards.  DAT as well, but he will see fewer looks.  When you take away Fasano I think you will see more looks go towards the wide receivers.  I think Charles will be 2nd or 3rd behind Maclin and maybe Kelce in receiving TDs with Knile following behind a few, but still more than most of our receivers, but we won't see a repeat of last season.  That's like hitting the jackpot and assuming your next lotto ticket will be a winner as well."
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,kloiberin_time,3,Tue Jun 30 10:01:58 2015 UTC,"Even on the worst teams, it takes a lot of bad luck to not have a WR TD.  And we had it all including TD's were the WR did all the work then fumbled it to someone else  Feeling confident predicting zero WR TDs for ANY team is just silly.  And predicting zero on a team that upgraded at WR and OL is even more silly."
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,materhern,3,Tue Jun 30 16:20:53 2015 UTC,I know for sure the number of TDs/yards I put for individuals combined is higher than what I put for the team total. But fuck it. I'm drinking everyone's koolaid (except Hemingway)
KansasCityChiefs,3bjym1,chiefsfan71308,3,Tue Jun 30 02:26:33 2015 UTC,Alex Smith 38 passing TDs
KansasCityChiefs,3badw1,ChromaticKs,20,Sat Jun 27 08:32:37 2015 UTC,I absolutely loved a Vermeil offense.  I wish I could say the same thing for defense.  If we had half the defensive talent we have now we would have been a dynasty under Vermeil.

KansasCityChiefs,3badw1,gta0012,8,Sat Jun 27 15:26:19 2015 UTC,God our OLine was so good to be able to trust them for that long on a run play too. Roaf and Shields were absolute FREAKS for their size and when you get them swung out blocking against CBs on those sweeps it was already over.

This might be something we enjoy in the off-season, but it will drown us in the regular season. Quality control- If someone else reads the blog and thinks it's great then they post it here. It helps to weed out the good blogs from the bad ones. It makes it almost a nomination system rather than just a copy-paste.    Maybe there is some middle ground? Maybe the rule can only be during the regular season?   I really enjoy this subreddit and don't want it to just end up being an aggregate of blog posts."

KansasCityChiefs,3avbiq,materhern,6,Tue Jun 23 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"I love love love Justin Houston. However, I understand the hesitancy to give him a huge contract."
KansasCityChiefs,3avbiq,gta0012,8,Wed Jun 24 02:20:54 2015 UTC,"None of this addresses the actual problem: Houston wants to be the highest paid OLB in the league, and he wants money on par with JJ Watt. Clearly, Dorsey doesn't see enough value in him to guarantee ~55 mil on a 100+ mil contract for an outside LB. They will probably cave and give it to him, eventually, but if he plays on that tag this year and gets hurt, Houston will leave KC and he will do it on bad terms.   Am I confident they have the ability to pay him? Hell yes. Am I confident they will? Fuck no."
KansasCityChiefs,3avbiq,Micori,6,Tue Jun 23 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"If I were Clark/Dorsey, I wouldn't pay him. At least, not at that level.  Watt/Suh and other overpaid defenders will never be on a successful team with those salaries."
KansasCityChiefs,3avbiq,WallyReflector,3,Wed Jun 24 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"Justin Houston is awesome, seems like a good dude and he is the Jamaal Charles of the Defense in the sense that he makes other teams respect us. I love the fact that the Chiefs have a guy who is arguably the best at his position, right now..... However, making someone the highest paid player at their position rarely works out for the team that does it (Too many examples to list). That being said I hope he gets a deal  that's good for him and fair to the Chiefs."
KansasCityChiefs,3avbiq,jmdybf,2,Wed Jun 24 04:36:06 2015 UTC,Hopefully Tamba can talk some sense into him and get him to realize that it will probably hurt the team if he signs a gigantic contract. Let the team sign him to a big contract because he is worth it but imo he is not worth Watt money.
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,DeepFriedFootball,11,Mon Jun 22 17:38:39 2015 UTC,Keep Alex Smith through his contract. I just can't see a good enough argument to drop him before 2018. He's a Top 10-15 quarterback on most of the analysis I've seen this off season. His play isn't abysmal and he would be considered an upgrade to many NFL teams.
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,badger992,-9,Mon Jun 22 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"""top 10-15""  I don't agree with the assessment but last year he was getting ""top 25"" numbers.    http://www.reddit.com/r/KansasCityChiefs/comments/1nktvd/the_quarterback_index_ranking_the_starters_132/"
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,king_hippo77,9,Tue Jun 23 01:26:56 2015 UTC,"That article was published in October 2013 when Alex Smith had only made 4 starts in a Chiefs uniform.  Here's the same writer putting him at 15 and 16 after the 2014 season.  I'm searching for the video, but I'm positive I saw someone rank him at 10. I am very optimistic for next season. Third season under Andy Reid, great WR improvement at wide receiver, and a slight upgrade to the O-Line. I'm predicting 10 wins this season and I also believe DAT will score 10 total touchdowns between punt returns, jet sweeps, and a passing TD here and there."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,badger992,3,Tue Jun 23 01:37:11 2015 UTC,I always felt he was better than the #'s thrown around... even the #'s he's producing... but the #'s rarely put him that high.  He's more than #'s though.
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,king_hippo77,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"Why, though, are we paying receivers of the magnitude of maclin, if we're okay with a middling quarterback? Even at 10, he's at the very bottom of the top third and he's statistically a lot closer to 20 than he is to 1.  I don't want to sound like just another Smith hater but I really don't think he has it in him."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,GragasInRealLife,3,Tue Jun 23 12:19:29 2015 UTC,"What are the other options? Are there any other veterans on the market that would provide better results? Do we have a high enough draft pick to get a top college prospect? I'm not a diehard Smith supporter, but I would like to see an upgrade before just dropping him."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,badger992,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point. I just think we should be more realistic about him.  I also think we need to be willing to look at unconventional quarterbacks if we want to become leaders in the league. I don't know if you remember Colin Klein of Kansas State from a few years back, but he was a fantastic dual threat qb, kind of guy that would probably function great in KC's current setup. Alas, he was too small for the NFL, so he didn't get drafted.  I wish we could start to move away from long established convention in the position and maybe get somebody like him that would shake the league up a bit."

KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,CTRJDM1775,2,Wed Jun 24 05:50:56 2015 UTC,"Only 10 out of 32 teams can have a top 10 QB.  If you believe you have to have that to get to the Super Bowl, then you are conceding that 22 teams have no chance every single year from the beginning."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,materhern,2,Tue Jun 23 18:42:05 2015 UTC,I think saying a third of the league has a chance to be champion from week one is extremely generous. And also reasonable. Quarterback is the only position that touches the ball every play. They have a massive amount of power over the outcome of the game.
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,GragasInRealLife,3,Tue Jun 23 19:00:36 2015 UTC,What I'm saying is that pretty much no other teams would ever have a chance.  Great QB's are a very finite resources.  To expect that you can't win without one means you just give up.  Because most of these great QB's are going to be locked up long term.
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,materhern,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"Well, so be it. One position that important puts a limiter on actual super bowl contenders, and I don't think Alex Smith puts us inside that limiter."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,GragasInRealLife,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:30 2015 UTC,"We'll have to agree to disagree.  There have been non-top ten QB's to win it all.  Dilfer and Flacco come to mind.  In the post season, your QB can get hot and then all bets are off.  As an example, our last playoff game, against the Colts, Alex Smith played out of his mind.  We should have won that game easily.  So he is capable of playing at a much higher level at times."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,materhern,7,Tue Jun 23 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Teams that would take AS off our hands in a heartbeat:  NYJ Buffalo Chicago Washington Cleveland St. Louis Arizona And Houston  That's not including teams that have either question marks at QB, whether it's that the QB is still unproven, contract situation, or scheme fit:  Minnesota Tennessee Cincinnati Jacksonville Oakland And San Francisco  That's almost half the league right there. Alex Smith is very good. Is he elite? No, but after years of Huard, Thigpen, and Quinn leading the league in turnovers, I'm more than happy with Smith and his conservative ways.  Like many, I also get frustrated by Smith's conservative play, but there have been very few games in his first couple seasons I could point to and say he lost that game for us... Not to mention all of the other traits he brings to the table that makes him a good QB (leadership, toughness, accountability, and intelligence). I will continue to ride for Smith."
KansasCityChiefs,3aqe4s,jpf8985,2,Tue Jun 23 02:37:57 2015 UTC,"I think people really underestimate the value of a QB that rarely to never turns the ball over.  The teams you listed all have QB's that can and do turn the ball over often or are young and unknowns.  Would I take him over Brady? No, obviously.  But I'd take him over Dalton and over half the other QB's in the league."

He was suspended for 4 games, was never injured, and had 0 off the field problems after the 4 week suspension,  and he still sat the bench the overwhelming majority of the rest of the season. Every article I see pastes him in at RT; based on last year, he doesn't get the starting job by a long shot."
KansasCityChiefs,3apoe6,Micori,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"He graded out much better when he was playing, pre-suspension.  He didn't ride the bench due to ability.  We couldn't figure out why he wasn't starting last year and most of us figured that he was in the dog house due to his suspension and possible beef with them over it after that.  I honestly think its much different this year."

You can take that for what it's worth, but I was told it's not because our tackles are bad, but because Allen is showing a lot of ability.  He will be a started at RG or RT."
KansasCityChiefs,3apoe6,jmdybf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised.  He was a very good Left Tackle in college.  In the draft it was said he was raw but had a ton of upside but would need a few years to really come up to speed as he had less training and less time in NFL type blocking schemes than most LT's.   I've thought all year he was going to end up at RT.  I usually put in him or Stephenson, but I've consider it his job to lose."

KansasCityChiefs,3apoe6,jmdybf,2,Mon Jun 22 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would we cut Allen?  He's on the last year of his rookie contract.  $973,249.  That would be stupid.  Plus he would have more trade value than Chase would.  Chase is overpaid as a backup and not good enough to be a starter.  Plus we are back down to 3 QBs, Smith, Daniel, Murray on the roster (and 1, Bray in IR)  I agree that Fisher/Grubbs/Kush are likely your starters.  Morse may beat out Kush, but I think Kush will at least start the year at the position.  I think Allen will start at either RG or RT."

KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,dd2811,17,Sun Jun 21 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"To put this into perspective, Matt Cassel had the entire Chiefs fan base excited to see what Brady Quinn could do. I wish that pain on no one. Not even the Bills, the team that took out Eric Berry's knee.  That being said, I always had hope for Matt Cassel mostly because he was a really nice guy off the field. You want to see the guy succeed. He just doesn't."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,Casedilla,12,Sun Jun 21 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"When he had an incredible offensive coordinator,  the perfect set of weapons around him, and Dwayne Bowe's one monster year thats the only time he was worth a shit."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,bradasskg,23,Sun Jun 21 08:47:06 2015 UTC,"The 2010 season was a bit of a bright spot, but a lot of things fell into place that year--great offensive coordinator, Dwayne Bowe exploding, solid offensive line, one of the best running games of all time (Charles 6.4 ypc and over 1,400 yards) and one of the weakest schedules in the league--we faced 3 teams that ended with winning records, going 1-1 against the 9-7 Chargers and losing to the Colts.  His other good season was on a team that just went 16-0 the prior season with 4,800 yards passing and 50 receiving TD's.  Anyone here saying he would've/could've been ""good"" is just delusional.  Good doesn't mean below average, which is what he was.  Good quarterbacks are guys like Romo, Flacco, Eli Manning, Stafford, Alex Smith, hell, Andy Dalton........what I'm getting at here is if you can rank more than half the league's starters before reaching Cassel, he isn't good.  So sure, if the stars align, he can maybe get you to the playoffs (Pats didn't make the playoffs 2008 despite an 11-5 season), but chances are we could've gotten there with Lin Elliott throwing the ball that year."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,pgrily,6,Sun Jun 21 06:38:45 2015 UTC,"I think if Charlie Weis stuck around, he might've had a better go at it.  Edit:  I'm not saying he would've been great, he just would've had a better tenure.  Weis was the reason he did so well that one year and then he bolted."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,holyfuckamole,2,Sun Jun 21 12:26:22 2015 UTC,I agree. He knew how to make Cassel serviceable. Honestly I feel much better now with Reid and company though.

However, I did meet Matt Cassel a couple times through family connections and he seemed to be a really cool guy that played the game he was passionate for, whether or not he was amazing. I had respect for the guy, and felt bad for him throughout all the hate he had through the Kingdom."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,BenedictJudas,4,Sun Jun 21 05:55:27 2015 UTC,I think him being a good guy/team player helped him stay longer than he should've though. People kept holding out hope when it was clearly not a long term answer

KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,BenedictJudas,4,Wed Jun 24 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"He was generally pretty bad. 2010 saw him paired up with Charlie Weis, who squeezed every ounce of production out of the offense that he could. Unfortunately him and Todd Haley were oil and water. I don't like to put the Chiefs failures on Cassel, though.   Scott Pioli tied himself to Cassel from day one with a six year $63M deal and drafted quite poorly with a few exceptions (Berry, McCluster, Houston, Poe). Cassel was simply in over his head. Would've been a nice backup. He was one of those guys who's got a ton of heart, but doesn't have the talent to match it."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,ZouTiger026,11,Sun Jun 21 06:00:56 2015 UTC,he's the worst QB that's ever started 4 years in a row that we've ever had.  He was complete dogshit for us.
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,ChiefsPlanetHero,4,Sun Jun 21 15:26:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say dogshit but I'll agree to the first part. He wasn't good. Just remember some of the actual dogshit we've tolerated (Croyle, Thigpen, Huard)"

KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,phism,4,Sun Jun 28 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"Seemed like a good guy, but Pioli's marriage to him despite poor play, astronomical contract and lack of competition brought in doomed him here."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,Wild_Bill_Kickcock,4,Sun Jun 21 05:57:25 2015 UTC,"So a lot of people are telling you he's bad.  Here's why:  Cassel never completes a progression.  A good QB will look at each target.  My #1 open?  No.  My #2?  Not yet.  My #3?  Nope.  TE?  Nothing there.  HBack?  Nope.  Can I scramble for yards?  Not really.  If someone's open, fantastic.  If not they will keep going down the list until they are forced to scramble or throw it away.  Cassel would look at Bowe, look at Charles, look back at Bowe, and then either force it into double coverage, panic and run, or throw it away.  Cassel can be a turnover machine.  Those with rose colored glasses will remember 2010 where he had a 27-7 TD/INT ratio, but outside of that year he has really struggled.  Even in 2010 so much of that was based off of luck.  Defenders dropped multiple passes that hit them in between the numbers."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,kloiberin_time,8,Mon Jun 22 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"He wasn't a great quarterback and it was clear he wasn't a franchise guy, so as a quarterback, I hated him.  However, not once did he complain about going from the patriots to a team so clearly in a rebuilding phase. With everything else going wrong, it was nice to see a guy who really wanted to be a part of the community, so for that, I'll always hope he finds his success somewhere."

KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,LegitLlama,-1,Mon Jun 22 20:25:32 2015 UTC,"He is good if: 1. He has a good RB (that can catch/run) 2. He has ONE WR to throw the ball to 3. The Def/special teams make it easy You have McCoy, Watkins, and a good D. I think he might do alright."
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,CaptainRatTrap,0,Fri Jun 26 00:15:36 2015 UTC,Pretty let down not all his fault though. We have lacked a true threat since Tony G. left in the passing game. Basically felt like we were trying to copy the pats every way possible then. Would have been interesting to see if Cassel played his entire career as the starter of the pats pretending Brady's knee injury was way worse
KansasCityChiefs,3akyf5,IWantThatInMyMouth,-5,Fri Jun 26 11:22:25 2015 UTC,"He would ha e been good if we had an o line. He's a guy that needs time. He's alright...a little worse than jay cutler, and a little better than Ryan Fitzpatrick."

KansasCityChiefs,3aiob0,Rizzoriginal,3,Sat Jun 20 17:12:45 2015 UTC,Stroud's though. Theres always room for fried food.
KansasCityChiefs,3aiob0,TomBad87,3,Sat Jun 20 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Gotta love it! But everything (except BBQ, of course, which is -- if made properly -- already perfect) is better when it's deep fried!"
KansasCityChiefs,3aiob0,Jakedubbleya,4,Sat Jun 20 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"Your content is hilarious, I love it.  Get a hold of /u/thevetnoob  He's our up and coming Chiefs expert and I know for a fact he's looking for ideas on what kind of content to put out there. He's motivated and probably has a better grip on the NFL than anyone I've seen in this sub.  Hopefully you guys can team up so the guy can start doing things other than organizing off season mock drafts."

The content is definitely there which is great but if you could make it somewhat easier for us to see the ""comment"" buttons annd maybe consider posting an open thread foor us new members to alll share our fandom that would be awesome.    Also, if you ever want help adding content journalism would have been my major in college had I not dropped out. I was editor of my high school's paper for a few years so im actually well versed in APA style and structure for journalistic writing."

This is the driest part of the offseason, where good articles are the hardest to create, so having multiple minds involved is almost necessary.   I said all that to say this: deepfriedfootball@gmail.com.  Send any content you want to that email, and I will respond with details. I truly appreciate your support brother, thank you!  Oh, and I will get those comment buttons figured out shortly; I myself am a regular of arrowheadpride (such a great site) and was definitely aiming for a community such as they have. So your input and creativity, what with you sharing the same mindset, is absolutely welcome and needed."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,AHH_CHARLIE_MURPHY,21,Thu Jun 18 04:18:49 2015 UTC,With our schedule I don't see us getting a bye. Of course I would fucking love it but I wouldn't predict it.  Winning the division.. Hate to sound cliche but it really depends on Peyton
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,veggie_sorry,6,Thu Jun 18 04:42:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is the year the Chiefs either split or sweep the Donkeys. We're improving and they had sweeping organizational change.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,PoonTunes429,4,Thu Jun 18 18:06:49 2015 UTC,Honestly we have the talent to do so..  But that's not going to happen if we let the raiders beat us and don't take those must wins.  O line and injuries will be the fall of us if anything.  As with any team.  I'm hopeful though.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,dvohs13,2,Thu Jun 18 17:12:13 2015 UTC,As long as Manning is the QB of the Broncos I will never count them out of the division race so I think it will be close
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,DadSavage13,4,Sat Jun 20 23:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm of the wait and see mindset. I don't want to predict anything until I've seen them play as a team. But going off what I know so far, and I'll get downvoted for this, I don't think we'll make the playoffs at all. Again I'd like to see training camp/preseason outcomes first though."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,ProfessorBort,3,Thu Jun 18 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"Everybody in here needs to stop being so cynical.  Chiefs will dominate the entire division so hard that other teams will fear to play us.  It will be a steamroller tracking over a pile of corpses.  Oh, and an obvious Superbowl Win that will be so good they blow up Levi's after it's over."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,Philo_T_Farnsworth,4,Thu Jun 18 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"We haven't won a playoff game since 1994.  I'm excited about our chances this year, but how about we don't get cocky until we actually win something."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,ProfessorBort,3,Thu Jun 18 19:42:18 2015 UTC,I love how I'm getting downvoted for saying we're gonna kick ass.  Bunch of pessimists in here.  I live in the Bay and even the Raider's fans aren't as big of sad sacks as we can be.  I know about the drought. I also know that a ton of those playoff losses were winnable games and that we have some terrible luck.  This perpetual victimhood of our fanbase is boring and cliche.  Get pumped up and believe!  Also: Fuck the Raiders.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,camthegod,2,Thu Jun 18 21:04:42 2015 UTC,wassup from another Bay Area Chiefs fan
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,Philo_T_Farnsworth,4,Sun Jun 21 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"Sad sack?  Perhaps you missed where I said ""I'm excited about our chances this year"".  If you want to start trash talking after we start off the season 5-0, I'm all for it.  But it's June, dude.  We don't know shit about the 2015 Chiefs yet in terms of how things are gonna work out on the field.  You can have all the talent in the world but you still have to win the games.  I don't know how long you've been a fan, but do you remember the 1998 Chiefs?  Everyone thought we were gonna win the Super Bowl that year (before the season started).  For all we know right now, the 2015 Chiefs could just be another incarnation of the 1998 Chiefs.  They had all the talent in the world and went 7-9, including a six game losing streak.  The Monday Night Meltdown  happened that year.  I was at that game, and it was embarrassing.  The team fucking imploded.  So no, I'm not being pessimistic, I'm being practical.  We don't know how the season is going to go yet.  Definitely get excited about the team!  But bullshit like ""Chiefs will dominate the entire division so hard that other teams will fear to play us"" is just unwarranted.  Right now, anyway.  Let's table that sort of shit until at least October."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,BooRastaPenguin,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"What he's saying is simple, doc:  ""You're supposed to be a fan. Act like one.""  If you were writing an unbias piece or review, then of course you take the rose colored glasses off.  But this is a Chiefs fan thread - so, yes, we will go 19-0, until proven otherwise.  Go Chiefs!"
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,Thelightbeamrider,2,Fri Jun 19 23:44:15 2015 UTC,I don't think we will win the division but If we do I don't think we will get a bye
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,dj_slugworth,2,Thu Jun 18 07:15:03 2015 UTC,"squeak by. i think the chiefs, broncos and chargers will all be hovering around 10 wins."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,historynutjackson,2,Thu Jun 18 12:03:59 2015 UTC,"I think we have all the pieces, we just need to wait and let them gel together. This season, we'll squeak on by into the Wildcard round, next year we'll be the clear winners."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,fett4evr,2,Thu Jun 18 15:18:53 2015 UTC,No wildcard. I don't think we'll be lucky enough to get a bye either. We will however win in the playoffs.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,king_hippo77,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:26:52 2015 UTC,Is it possible to win the division and still get a wild card?  I thought the wild cards were for runner ups... or is it strictly w/l ratio?
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,Nephew_of_Poseidon,2,Fri Jun 19 22:16:47 2015 UTC,You can win the division and play in the wildcard weekend.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,king_hippo77,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"But you're playing against either of the wild card teams, you're not a wild card team... right?"
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,PRETTYSHlTTYGANGBANG,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:48:50 2015 UTC,Not considered a wildcard berth though
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,bradasskg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:04:51 2015 UTC,"Assuming Manning truly is declining rapidly in his football health, I can definitely see us winning the division in a very petite,, drama free fashion. TCB. Just 'Take Care Business'."
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:02:17 2015 UTC,Probably a wild card berth. It'll be tough to top both Denver and San Diego
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,kittonmittonz,-1,Sun Jun 21 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"If they squeak by and have a wildcard birth, they wouldn't win the division. I believe we take the division by 2 games"
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,andy0651,2,Thu Jun 18 04:32:48 2015 UTC,I think he means still play during wildcard weekend and not get the bye.
KansasCityChiefs,3a8yzp,Bombay66,0,Thu Jun 18 10:49:21 2015 UTC,"Conservative estimates have the Chiefs at 9-7 or 10-6, which is good. That's right where you want to be with a difficult schedule. People think you're good enough to go to the playoffs, maybe good enough to win a playoff game or two. I think the Chiefs actually win the division this year. I think they've improved everywhere they needed to and hopefully fixed the complacency/finishing issues that cost them a playoff berth, possibly the division last year (TEN, @OAK, @ARI, @DEN). If they win it, I think it'll be by a game over the Broncos at 11-5 or 12-4, which likely won't be good enough for a bye. I am 100% fired up about this year."

We have Abdullah, Parker and Branch and hopefully next year we get Berry back."
KansasCityChiefs,3a82gt,kloiberin_time,7,Thu Jun 18 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"Next time you hear anything about him, it'll probably be injury news again..."

Hopefully this reduction in weight allows him to better keep his feet under him, allowing him to maximize his incredible skillset. I'd love to see him as the 4th or 5th S. I see them keeping Abdullah, Parker, Branch, Kelcie, and Commings, with Berry on NFI."
