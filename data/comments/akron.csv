I know I'm being critical here so please don't read it in an argumentative tone; but ""Taco Bell yum?"" And then you drive by Swenson's and didn't say anything. Personal preference in food aside, you decided to root for an international chain restaurant in a video that is geographically specific. That being said, I liked your music and the style with which the text was layer over. And I would enjoy if you created similar videos that focused the content more on the unique gems in akron. Again, I don't want that to be read in a harsh tone. I'm genuinely trying to give constructive criticism."
akron,3e18j7,cjs62,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:00 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU! People are so afraid to use constructive criticism because society seems to take things as either coddling or tearing-down. I truly am glad I got such a thought out answer so quickly. The location notes were the last thing I added (Taco Bell being the first one, because my friends know i'm obsessed with it, seriously, I love love love Taco Bell, lol. But, so after adding it I figured why not add a few more). I agree I should have highlighted Swensons, rather than it's competitor Sky Way if I had to pick one. That was weird of me, you're right. Land of Plenty is run by a friend of mine, so I pointed that out for that reason. Hmm. The video was almost uploaded with only the bottom-right location text (Wallhaven, Downtown, etc) as opposed to the centered-text location commentary. I do wanna do more of these. This video, as it existed without text, has been sitting in my phone for 3 months for no reason. I made it in April on a drive across town with a friend (I don't have a car) just to play around with Hyperlapse. I'm glad people watched this, though. Maybe I should make some that aren't so fast. Like this ones 2 min long and covers a 25 min drive. Doing little speed-tours would be interesting if I slowed it down and pointed out more stuff. Also, I learned making this to keep the camera pointed forward. Any time I turned it out the side window it got too insane looking.    Sorry if this was too jumbled. I just shot this comment off late at night (it's almost 3AM. I should be in bed) because I was so excited I got such a good reply. But I'll use your criticism to make a better video soon, I think. I'm glad people care about these.    Also: I have a version of this without the ""vintage"" filter over it. Should I post them with natural color in the future, or do it this way? It's just one of the iMovie default filters. I'm not a professional video editor, just a fan of art and fooling with media. Did the coloring work for or against this?"
akron,3e18j7,cjs62,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:42:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not an editor either, so I'm not sure about the filter. It makes sense now that you explained where the footage came from, and the fact that you targeted the comments at specific people rather than the masses."

I have an air conditioner unit that sticks out of my room and out onto my balcony, and I just prop my phone up on that. I wish I had a tall tripod, but I can make do with what I've got for this.    I use the awesome app Hyperlapse for this (it's insanely useful for image stabilization, and totally free. Everyone with an iPhone should have it for taking videos. It doesn't record audio, but for time lapse or other artsy shots it's great. For example, if you hold your phone while in a car it cuts out all the bumping and swaying and it looks amazing. I was going to upload a vid I shot like that shortly).    From there I just take the clips (almost all of those 5-10 second bits were 20-45 min long in real life) and put them into the iMovie app (phone not computer version) and double the speed in them, save, double speed, save, etc as many times as it takes to get it as sped up as I want, as Hyperlapse only goes up to 16X (essentially taking a ~45 min clip and making it a bit under 3 min. I like them to be under ten seconds though for these purposes).    Other Akronites on here should do similar stuff. I think it's a cool way to show off the city's beauty. If I had more money I'd love to shoot footage around town with a drone, but that'll be in the future when I'm not living paycheck to paycheck.     Whatcha guys think of my efforts here, though?

Granted the new ownership got sales up, but the name is stupid. It's an embarrassment to be called the Ducks with crappy colors and logos. They only asked a handful of public people to decide and vote on it."
akron,3ctiyv,Jobe422,3,Fri Jul 10 21:48:16 2015 UTC,"Uhm… Do you follow Minor League Baseball?  In 2012, the Aeros won the Eastern League Championship and averaged 3,772 fans/game putting them 9th in the league.  The first year new ownership took over, they moved up to 7th at 4,221/game.  The first years as the Rubber Ducks, they moved into 4th at 5,157/game.  Both seasons fielded significantly worse baseball teams.    99% of people that go to Rubber Ducks games probably can't tell you what the team's record is or name more than one or two players on the team anyway.  They go for entertainment.    Finally, our old logo was a red cat wearing a rocket pack.  We were only called the ""Aeros"" because the public freaked out about the original name.  I'm not sure I ever saw more than 5 people per year wearing Aeros merchandise outside of Canal Park.  You see Rubber Ducks hats, t-shirts, stickers, etc. everywhere around Akron now."

It's an embarrassment to be called the Ducks with crappy colors and logos.   I saw tons of Aeros gear, and I still see people wearing them.  I love my city, not the idiots who do shit like this and make us punch lines for jokes."

akron,3cu19h,bugxbuster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:39:22 2015 UTC,How much is it per week? Does anyone know? Is this team based or individuals?
akron,3cu19h,Timmocore,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"It is individual - you are randomly placed with 3 other people and your group plays 4 assigned games. You are competing against the other people in your group - if you win the game, you get 4 points, 3 for 2nd, 2 for 3rd, and 1 for 4th.   As far as cost, you have to pay whatever the game costs - typically ranges 2- 3 dollars per week for the league part. Playing before and after is optional but also ranges from 50 cents to a dollar per game. There is a bar next to the machines so more if you want to have a couple drinks as you play."

akron,3cs8vu,Planzorg1,3,Fri Jul 10 17:38:08 2015 UTC,its pretty much the same as all the other festivals they do at lock 3 but with Italian food/music instead of ribs/hamburgers.  The Italian fest is probably the better of the 3 though.
akron,3cs8vu,jgz84,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:43 2015 UTC,It's weird that it says it only goes to 9pm on Saturday when they are having fireworks at 9:45pm.
