Iâll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Iâve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Iâm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youâre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thatâs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

DvZCirclejerk,39m57m,TheKazbot,2,Fri Jun 12 18:57:06 2015 UTC,"It's going to be a messy update and if you are the type of person to cry foul at balance and testing, do us a favor and sit out this week. When me and Nisovin get the game to a state we are happy with, we will be looking for feedback like we always do, but we really don't need backseat developers this weekend!   Dudes, this thread sent me into a rage this morning. I can't even read most of your comments because I'm so blinded by hatred rather than passion that you guys can't hold the criticism till I'm done. This type of thread doesn't inspire me to keep working, it makes me want to stop touching it all together. I asked you to hold criticisms till I was done not for your sake, but for mine. If you question me at every step and turn and force me to explain everything I won't be able to do it. I won't be making a video today anymore. I'm gonna focus on the changes I want to make, but I'm no longer ready to talk to you guys because I'm super frustrated. Which is annoying, because I need to make a video to get general casual player base to start filling in. You guys seem to forget how DvZ had 2000 players last summer, and now you're lucky to break 100. We have to do releases in stages to not just kill the server, but I'm so mentally and physically exhausted that waking up to a thread where I have to defend all the changes I have yet to complete to you guys over and over is just draining. It would do me and DvZ a lot of good, if you could just hold criticisms till I'm done. You guys have a direct effect on my ability to function. The amount of ignorance, elitism, and doubt still overpowers all the good intentions I know you guys have when you make your posts. I have no way to test all the things I want to learn while at the same time explaining everything along the way, yet you guys insist I do. I made a ""Please Remain Patient"" thread so you guys would remain Patient. Not turn this into a massive discussion to pick apart what we have done so far."

DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,ciaranway,23,Thu May 28 02:19:38 2015 UTC,"/unjerk  Azur answered your ticket, not me. I told Azur months ago to ignore your tickets as you seem to think you were banned for troll? That confuses me.  http://i.imgur.com/I381TxZ.png  http://i.imgur.com/BnDFc4C.png  http://i.imgur.com/Kjfdtk4.png  http://i.imgur.com/Id5WO7l.png  You have over a dozen tickets of just that username, let alone your alts. You act like you never did anything wrong when you were a toxic mess who was only shitting on the game and the fans around it and ever since then you would come here to shit on DvZ under the guise that it's trolling, when really it wasn't. After all this when you submitted your ticket for appeal, you were not remorseful in any way. Even if you truly were just ""joking"" you must have realized that people didn't think so and your jokes aren't making anyone laugh other than yourself and close friends. This isn't ""voicing"" your opinion, this is just being an asshole. And when we told you weren't going to be unbanned. You just made alt account after alt account and harassed me, nisovin, our mods for what? You acted like a spoiled child who couldn't get his way.   So heres what I'm going to do Ciaranway, I'm going to tell the guys to lift your ban and in return you are never going to be toxic in our community again. You are not going to be rude to another player in game, you are not going to post on this subreddit or the DvZ subreddit for the next year, and you're not going to make me regret giving you a chance you so badly want because your previous attitude was not only unacceptable, but disgusting man. You are clearly passionate about DvZ and we will give you a chance to turn that passion into a positive element in our community, but you lose the ability to talk about game balance because the last time you talked about it, you were frankly just kinda an asshole. If you don't like the direction the game/community goes in the future, you just walk away and leave us alone. I'm personally never going to care about what you think about the game, for the time being anyway, like I do others because man... you were just shitty to us. But if you can tell me you'll be helpful to new jimmies, remain positive, and just learn to make DvZ a great place for people to relax without the toxicity, then you can come back.  If that sounds fine, I'll have the guys lift your ban, but seriously dude, you were a shithead and I hope you can at the very least accept you were being shitty, stop being shitty, and just learn to be a positive force in our community instead of a joke to the rest of this circlejerk.   Most people who get banned don't throw a fit, they repent and we give them this exact deal. It's a secret to how we moderate I learned from Blizzard. I would have unbanned you sooner, but you never really seemed to learn your lesson. I don't even know if you have now, but I'm willing to give you a chance because at the very least everyone here won't support you if you decided to be a dick later down the line. Don't act like I have some personal vendetta against you, it's that blind ego and hate that causes people to live really sad lives man. You were making the game unenjoyable for other people and you were removed, that's all."

DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,Imhotep0,0,Thu May 28 10:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yea I meant to say I submitted a ticket. Well Like I say to overhighlord,  If I were to come back with an alt anyway why can't I just use my main account with all my upgrades. I know what I did wrong. I trolled and I offended people. I didnt even say it in the way that I was banned for. I coined the word retard as an insult like I do with my friends everyday I obviously did not purposely mean to insult anyone retarted.

DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,Rurikar,1 point,Thu May 28 15:38:25 2015 UTC,"Well that's wrong. If I have a good memory - and I think I do - he said 'I think your a good member of this community but I disagree with a lot of your ideas'. Which is fine, even though I think they're good there might be something they don't balance with, something planned they'll contridict with, or something I've overlooked.  Besides, several of my ideas either didn't get 'shat on' or were actually implemented - Map side rotation, changing armour from when it decreased in effectiveness,  nerfing momentum hearts. Maybe others I can't remember."
DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,Wifi_LC,7,Fri May 29 10:58:24 2015 UTC,"/unjerk  Nisovin liked I lot of your ideas and while I might not like them and if Nisovin thinks they are good, I respect that. At this point he knows as much as me with this stuff.  While I can be stubborn from time to time about how things are in DvZ, Niso is my anchor that doesn't let me go overboard and vise versa. If I think X is stupid and has no place in DvZ, but Nisovin really wants to try it, I'm not going to stop him because he brings just as much to this game as me these days. Without him DvZ would be nowhere near the condition its in today."

DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,Wifi_LC,2,Fri May 29 17:44:03 2015 UTC,I believe he was temp banned and that it was going to end around this time but I don't know if he plays with alts atm and I'd much prefer to go into the summer update with the refund and a pile of gold that his main account probs has compared to his low-leveled alt!
DvZCirclejerk,37jjzz,Awesomeshafter,-1,Fri May 29 11:12:51 2015 UTC,Yea I could always get an alt but then all my upgrades are gone which is so inconvenient. If I were to come back with an alt anyway why can't I just use my main account with all my upgrades. It's so stupid

People say to me that a person being an axe is Impossible and Iâm fucking retarded but I donât care, Iâm beautiful. Iâm having a dwarven smith install a handle, an axe head, and place me in a stupid location. From now on I want you guys to call me âAxxminâ and respect my right to chop wood to make torches and make worthless mortar.

I actually wanted to buy axxmin patron if he didn't get to join the private DVZ, I was one of the only ones to defend axxmin in our teamspeak channels when people would make stupid remarks, I was civil in every way when I responded to him ingame and tried to continue his jokes in chat, but yet I'm a dick for making light of a event that can't be helped ?

But yes, i do critisise some of the stuff you do and question it, but instead of dealing with it you just simply say that im wrong. Example. this happen close to every game these days.  Either way, i only can say that I'm sorry. I do hope you can forgive my silliness."
DvZCirclejerk,378xyd,Rurikar,8,Fri May 29 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"/unjerk  DvZ will never be balanced around the ideas of min/maxers. This isn't a competitive game and if you treat it like it requires that level of balance and purposely play in a way like you said, you are more of a problem then the problem you're talking about.  I didn't say you were wrong, I said you are a pretty shitty person to play like that. This isn't a game with thousands and thousands of players, most of the people you see daily are the same guys. It's like if you hung out with at your friends house every day, not because you like your friends, but because you want free soda. You doing something that only benefits you and not your team and that type of shit is always going to exist in team games. So if you are anti team, you are effectively being a shitty team member man. You can also go hide in stone at the back of the keep and be the last one who survives each round, does that make you feel like a winner too?  Nah, you were right and that's not what I was arguing against. I telling you that it's that attitude that sucks the fun out of DvZ. Telling me you don't ever mean to upset me while trolling through my twitter posts to find days I was super depressed and make fun of me for it, I get it's a circlejerk, but when all you ever do is negatively shit on people and call it trolling/little fun, it's gets blurred to me man."
