The AA's index of the cheapest deals on the market showed that the cost of annual comprehensive car insurance rose by 5.2% in the three months to the end of June.Drivers aged 23 to 29 have seen a 6.2% rise over the same period, the biggest increase of any age group.

This technology will be life changing but not like that. Right now you can still ride a horse to work if you wanted.  There are still cars without safety features. You can still get a car without power steering, seat belts, abs or fuel injection and drive it all over the place.  There will still be uses for a manually operated vehicle. There will always be open space and enthusiasts. Anyway, there will have to be a transition period where the person operated and computer operated cars will have to operate together so we'll have systems in place where they can always cohabitate. There's no reason to ever dismantle such a system once deployed.  People also confuse driving and commuting. People who love to drive are not talking about commuting(usually). Driving is for pleasure and commuting is because you have to. You may love driving when you have to and you'll always have that option.

There will always be someone who will want to own their car, just like there are people who own private aircraft. Those people will still be able to get performance level SDCs.  The big difference between these performance SDCs and the one you call from Uber is a ""experience mode"". Assuming that you have the proper insurance and permits, you hit ""experience mode"" and your car finds an area where traffic is very low and the road is interesting.  When you arrive, any SDCs that are on the road are alerted that your coming. Weather conditions, road surface conditions, maintenance levels, road composition, and tire pressure are all detected and calculated. you pass the invisible start line.  Your SDC takes off. Using it's ability to transfer power and brake to each wheel independently, the computer drives down the road as aggressively as possible.   You.. your just along for the ride, no control of the situation at all. It's like a roller coaster, but there are no rails.

SelfDrivingCars,3e38kp,occupythekitchen,3,Tue Jul 21 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"Will cars communicate with cars around them or all the cars in the road. The base of this question is will cars be connected to the internet or will they have their own communication system? I am assuming they will be mostly sensors and cameras at first   This is called Vehicle to Vehicle communications or V2V, there is also Vehicle to Infrastructure or V2I.  They will be connected to the internet/satellite. V2V or V2I will use their own frequency channels."
SelfDrivingCars,3e38kp,walky22talky,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:16 2015 UTC,"If cars are merging at a junction they have to talk to each other, likewise if they are managing separations - so that is V2V.  Clearly in these cases there can be a cut off range of say 100 meters, where cars outside that distance are not interested in the messages.   To learn about the latest in speed limits and road closures it makes sense to use a centralised server, hence V2I.  My own opinion is that the United Nations needs to host these servers and standardise the protocols, in an initiative aligned to and akin to the IPCC.    I really don't think there will be any communications from one car X to all cars - that would consume too much power.  However from one car to all cars, via a server would be plausible. Suppose a car detects a pot hole or lump in the road; such information needs to be relayed to the central server.  Any card in the vicinity of that pot hole, at any time in the future until it is fixed, needs to know of the pot hole. A likely scenario is that as cars progress along a road, they will periodically, say every minute, ask for and get an update on the local conditions.   Internet Protocol (IP) is so universally used, especially as the basis for Web Services, that I imagine that autonomous cars will use it too.  However, due to the pressures of security (hackers) this will be a closed network with quite intense encryption measures and access management employed.  There are quite a few data communications security protocols that appear to be secure - a lot has to do with key length and the business processes around the issue of crypto material.   Emergency vehicles will have to provide proper electronic credentials to establish their identity - whereupon the autonomous cars will yield to them.   Emergency vehicle credentials will need to be based on a certificate issued by a central trusted authority, surrounded by a robust business process.  My view is that the identity of emergency vehicles will be established by wireless communications technology in some radio frequency.  I don't think camera based pattern recognition technologies would lead such identification - as there is so much relative uncertainty in this approach, relative to the definitive nature of radio communications protocols.    Security protocols are the key and even for cars with Open Source Design and 3D Printing implementation, I believe there will still be strong and strict IdAM (identity and access management).  I think the likely central authority will be the UN and not some private corporation."

I think the part of the debate to self driving cars that is missing is who and how will the information relayed to vehicles be given to other vehicles."
SelfDrivingCars,3e38kp,modern-era,3,Wed Jul 22 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"It will be a mix of centralized communication (cell, V2I) and distributed (V2V). When most people talk about V2I and V2V, they're referring to DSRC communication, which is a dedicated bandwidth designated for vehicle communications. It has very low-latency, and was meant for crash avoidance. There are a few demos going on, but nothing in production vehicles.   How will smart/self driving cars differentiate an emergency vehicle from a normal vehicle. What would stop me from installing something that makes my car be recognized as an emergency vehicle so other autonomous cars get out of my way and i can go slightly faster than traffic?   The same laws that keep you from using a radar detector or beacon to switch traffic lights to green like fire trucks use. I believe the Google car listens for sirens, watches for emergency lights, and observes when nearby vehicles pull to the side to figure out what is an emergency vehicle. From the search, this appears relevant."

The base of this question is will cars be connected to the internet or will they have their own communication system? I am assuming they will be mostly sensors and cameras at first   Bits of both. Currently and at first they will have to work independently because the infrastructure simply isn't there and most cars won't be self driving. However, the more data the better, so I'd imagine that there will be some local sharing of data and using the Internet to get info. Something like how Chrome OS operates (basically downloads it fresh each time from a hardcoded address) might work.   Ultimately, nothing is hack proof. But then I can cut the brakes on your car.   How will cars protect themselves from hackers or jammers in the road. What if someone malicious goes on a road with a jammer to video tape cars having a pile up to put on youtube?   Firstly, you put none of the real time, safety stuff online, and you belt and braces everything. So you go off what data was there before (the road won't move), you go as safely as possible (slow to a stop and put hazards on). If in doubt, do nothing will be the watch word. Better someone is annoyed you stopped needlessly than they're dead.  Secondly, what do you do to people who cause pileups or drop concrete onto motorways? You prosecute them.

With most forms of rain the only issues are pot holes filling with water, aqua planing and the increased stopping distances. All of which are actually quite minor hurdles which autonomous vehicles in general have been shown to handle significantly better than humans already.

Reductions in safety structures can come later.   Also considering how these vehicles will almost certainly be owned by private companies. (There is no reason why local government can't also own and mange fleets). I believe the replacement rate will be closer to 1/9 and not 1/4. These organisations care about profit.

SelfDrivingCars,3dy9pc,moocow1452,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:24 2015 UTC,"But what would sell more?   At first it will be super-smart cars individually purchased by consumers since that will be the only viable option.  But shortly thereafter the vast majority of purchases will be by city governments, then state governments, and finally federal governments. By the time governments start buying up autonomous cars as a part of public transportation, the cars will essentially be hybrids of ""smart"" and ""dumb"" controls. Economically, governments will ultimately shut the private sector out of rent-a-car or subscription services, as taxing the hell out of the whole process will add great value and sustainability to respective currencies. Socially, many people will like it since it would be considered a viable candidate of common welfare.  In case you were wondering, investing in companies that have historically worked with governments on public transportation will be particularly lucrative, not necessarily those pioneering the enabling technologies."

On the controlled test track you can see how well your car handles every situation the testers can come up with. (""Every lap is different "").  I would argue the exact opposite.   Your tests on a controlled test track will never be as good as you can get in the real world, as your testers will never be able to imagine scenarios that the real world comes up with.  Certainly, it is nice to simulate a child running out into traffic, to test if the simulated child gets run over. But closed track superior to field testing?   No, it's inferior."

SelfDrivingCars,3dsb0k,wewewawa,17,Sat Jul 18 23:50:40 2015 UTC,"This goes way beyond the simple loss of revenue from these taxes ""fines"".  There is an entire industry surrounding people making mistakes in their cars. Mistakes ranging from parking in the wrong place all the way up to accidents causing injuries.   Thus there are a huge number of people either entirely employed or at least partially employed as a result. There is an entire court system that pretty much exists to deal with everything ranging from unpaid parking tickets all the way to drunken driving causing death. Then many lawyers make a sizeable chunk of their income from dealing with these cases. There are the people handing out tickets and even the companies who print the tickets.   There are even subtle monetizations of people's mistakes. Often a very convenient paid parking area will be far more expensive than a slightly less convenient paid or free parking area. Thus premium parking garages will find that their business is much more commodity than before.   This keeps spreading to tow truck operators, paramedics, firefighters, emergency rooms, autobody shops, etc. All businesses that have quite a bit of their work driven by bad driving. So ER rooms won't go out of business with driverless cars but there will be a less requirement for staff as there will be with many of the above jobs. The department of motor vehicles has many of its staff for the purpose of driver testing and issuing/renewing licences.  Even the people who make traffic lights and traffic signs will be far less required.   Then as the entire road system is restricted to automated cars only huge changes can be made. Any given road will have a far greater capacity with bumper to bumper cars travelling a high rates of speed. Thus highway construction will plummet as many 4 lane highways can be potentially reduced to 1. Having a 1 lane highway is not only 1/4th the cost but actually far less as paving a single lane is very easy whereas paving something wider is a more complicated engineering effort. So a fully automated auto fleet would devastate highway construction.   But one of the most interesting job losses will be in small towns that milk the local highway for traffic money. Often this not only provides the town with a little extra income but actually pays for their police. The police will sit on the highway collecting taxes until the rare trouble call comes in and then they go back to collecting taxes from the highway.   Without these fines coming in many small towns will basically not be able to afford police.  But if you ask many people who are employed only incidentally to autos and ask them what will happen if cars stop crashing and breaking laws you will find hidden in and among many professions that there will be job losses. For instance ask a physiotherapist what percentage of their clients were damaged in an auto related situation. For the most part you can use their answer to calculate the job losses in the physiotherapy related world due to self driving cars."

SelfDrivingCars,3dsb0k,TwoMoreDays,4,Sun Jul 19 07:11:48 2015 UTC,"On average you are probably correct. But out of all the ""losers"" I suspect that there will be some organizations that pretty much will lose their minds trying to defend the status quo. I could see cities leaving parking meters up so as to prevent ""driverless"" cars from parking there as only humans could feed in the quarters. Or I could see laws that will be put into place that will try to force things to stay the same.   One group of people who are going to lose big are those companies that benefit from having prime downtown parking lots. So grocery stores. Right now it would be pretty much impossible to open a new grocery store in most downtowns as buying a multi acre lot would be prohibitive. Most existing stores bought when the land was of little value and then the city grew around them.   Also many edge of the city malls are hoping for the city to grow around them and make them valuable too.  With SDCs you could open a grocery store that was only the store with little or no parking. Thus I can see organizations with large parking lots as a strategic advantage pushing for strange laws preventing people from sending their cars away to find parking while they shop. Or laws that make any new stores have a certain amount of parking per square foot of store or who knows. It will fail in the end but we will get to witness where they arm twist various local governments into doing something stupid for a little while."

They might even become the norm for local fleet driving, assuming that this doesn't become something that only a few mega companies dominate.  The car manufacturers will actually do very well as when the first functional somewhat automatic cars (you have to be in them) that allow you to drive handsfree to work come out people will flock to them. This will go on for a few generations(of cars) as people rapidly buy the cool new things. But as soon as truly driverless becomes available then the whole not own a car thing will probably take over.   So the better part of the next decade ought to be awesome for the car companies; then collapse as cars become very much a commodity."

A couple reasons:    They don't have experience in automotive grade manufacturing. This is the same problem google has, and it would be difficult to scale that up rapidly unless they partner/purchase an automotive company. The problem is that any of the automotive companies that partner with apple will lose their own brand under apples, and none want to do that. Google is probably much more willing to license their system on any vehicle, so that the vehicle still retains its own brand.  I don't think of apple as a data science/machine learning/AI software company, so I'm not sure they have the experience to build the required self driving software. Yeah, they could throw a bunch of money at it and  purchase companies, and build up the business units to enable this, but that takes some time.

Human nature is self preservation, when we are doing anything our gut reaction is to preserve ourselves. But second we attempt to save others.   Say you're walking across an intersection and child runs out ahead of you with their dog as a car is driving through the intersection. You can only grab and pull one of them back to safety. Do you grab the child or the dog?  The answer is easy for us, OP is asking how a programmed computer will handle this situation. You say it's mythical but that because we as humans don't have to pre think what we will do in that situation. But a computer has to. OP is 100% right in asking this.   My bigger follow up question when it comes to SDCs is; who does your car save in the event that it will either hit a pedestrian (say walking on the interstate) or swerve to miss them causing your car to fly off the highway and flip. If you hit them they a probably going to die. If you serve you are probably going to die.   These question are great questions but ones that are above me to figure out."
SelfDrivingCars,3dqfd1,Why_T,5,Sat Jul 18 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"I think in many driving situations though we don't really make much of a choice. We just try to avoid the danger that is immediate, but probably just panic and slam the brakes and/or turn the vehicle in a direction to reduce any crash. We don't normally make actual ethical decisions since the time to do that takes too long.   As for your dog/child scenario - we don't all react to that situation the same. Some would see the car coming down, and may not risk their life for someone else. If it's a parent then they will probably take the risk, and may just haphazardly try to grab both if they are close, otherwise probably grab the child. We don't really think about it in an ethical manner.   If a pedestrian comes onto the interstate, it is fundamentally their problem. If the car cannot safely stop or deviate their trajectory without causing other crashes, it will attempt to just brake to reduce damage. The vehicle should be able to see any pedestrian at quite some distance due to the design of interstates and the capability of the sensors."
SelfDrivingCars,3dqfd1,monkey_fish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"Do people grab the child or the dog? If not both, probably the one that's closer to them. People aren't rational and assuming they ""correctly"" make these kinds of ethical decisions is contrary to experimental results.   What kind of one-lane built hundreds of feet in the air highways do you drive on? Even single lane highways have shoulders that can be driven on, and ditches on the sides that can be driven into. No highway that I have ever been on in my entire life has ever been constructed such that the only options to avoid a reckless pedestrian would be to drive straight into the pedestrian or to fly off the highway, flipping the car with such force that it kills the occupants. (Flipping a car, while dangerous, is also unlikely to kill occupants wearing seatbelts)."

SelfDrivingCars,3dqfd1,monkey_fish,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:43:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say farthest only because the farthest object could be another vehicle heading towards you which would increase the overall damage. Otherwise I think this mostly makes sense, although I wonder if the software will make other determinations - i.e. a parked car, vs a tree, vs a pedestrian, vs some bushes. If it has the time to make a decision it would make more sense to aim for some bushes rather then a parked car. Although the more complexity of the hierarchy, the more complex the software which could be an issue. I think the initial state will be - protect the passengers as much as possible and follow the rule of law."
SelfDrivingCars,3dqfd1,stvbnsn,2,Sat Jul 18 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"This is what I heard on a google SDC video of how their system currently operates.  Perhaps the SDC can determine that an oncoming vehicle has a similar speed and an opposing direction, making the overall damage state that results greater than perhaps swerving off into the ditch on the side of the road.  I mean, I would imagine that in a crash scenario where the vehicle is still in control, it would be directed to absolutely at all costs not veer into oncoming traffic.  Crossing the center white line, I bet, is close to an unbreakable law governing SDC.    On the topic of assessing the damage caused by different objects, unfortunately SDC computers cannot tell the difference between a cannon ball or a beach ball.  As a result, every beach ball must be assumed to cause the damage of a cannon ball.  In the future, possibly 5-10 years after SDC are released, we may begin to see this type of object distinction, but that is a very complex issue that will need a lot of testing.  The issue isn't so much assessing the object and its resulting crash impact, it's doing so in real-time and without needing terabytes of comparative data.  Currently, the google SDC uses 6 TB of data without taking any of that into account."

This sub has largely dismissed this question, either speculating that vehicles will have God-like collision avoidance systems and will never crash, or claiming that humans wouldn't do better so who cares what a computer does.  The one system I've seen proposed assumed a computer could distinguish between a human and non-human, and in your scenario would collide with the dog. This was out of Stanford's mechanical engineering department. They have their own autonomous vehicles, so I'm confident that what they proposed works with existing technology.  Here are a few other journal articles on the subject of ethics in automated vehicles.  [1] General overview of automated vehicle ethics.  [2] Overview and proposes high-level strategies.  [3] Investigates whether a vehicle has a duty to sustain a collision to protect a more vulnerable third party.  [4] Responses to common criticisms of vehicle ethics.

There are obvious, but limited opportunities with the major AV developers, but its what happens once we get much closer to AV deployment that is where the opportunities will come thick and fast.  As once the tech hits the streets there will be so many killer apps and new business models that will suddenly emerge from the shadows/stealth mode. Business models that are but a gleam in someone's eye right now - but most haven't even been thought through properly yet (if at all).  So if you have some imagination, skills and stickability then I am almost certain that you will find something in the AV sector that motivates/excites/interests you over the next four years."

In most jurisdictions motorcycle insurance is high, but it doesn't in any way reflect the crash stat disparity just described.   However, if fully self-driving vehicles do end up demonstrating that they are much safer than human drivers, then the motorcycle insurance conundrum may well be brought into stark contrast.  It is therefore possible that many motorcycle riders could find themselves priced out of being able to drive their motorcycle on public roads because of much higher insurance premiums than now.  It will be interesting to see how this does in fact play out."
SelfDrivingCars,3dpdry,alephnul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:09:09 2015 UTC,I'd hope that self-driving cars would make it safer for motorcylists and therfore result in cheaper premiums.
SelfDrivingCars,3dpdry,monkey_fish,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"This article provides some typical data:   34 percent of motorcycle crashes involve one vehicle, according to the study. Compare that to only 19 percent of car crashes involving one vehicle. When looking at really severe and fatal motorcycle crashes, 50 percent of those accidents involve just the motorcycle and no other vehicle.   So motorcycle crashes are still going to occur - mostly because average rider error on a motorcycle has more severe outcomes than  average rider error in a metal box (car).  Therefore premiums for motorcyclists are all but guaranteed to go up as they will be having crashes at an even greater frequency with automated vehicles than they do now with human driven cars."
SelfDrivingCars,3dpdry,sweetmoses,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:51:52 2015 UTC,"I think you need to also take into account the cost ceiling when it comes to potential insurance claims. Most major motorcycle accidents only involve the driver of the vehicle. Damage to property and others is substantially less likely to occur, so the tort potential is much less from grieving families.  Also, your assumption is that insurance will increase as the discrepancy between car and motorcycle injuries widens. Rather, I think the cost would decrease. So motorcycle insurance would remain the same (or rise with inflation as usual) but car insurance would cheapen."
SelfDrivingCars,3dpdry,Mr_Munchausen,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think we'll look at motorcycles like primitive death machines in 50 years.   Motorcycles require interaction (balance) at low speeds, so they can never truly be self-driving. They also have no passenger protection whatsoever, and would be a huge liability for injury. We don't look at road travel risk the way we will in the near future. Today, about 30,000 people die per year on the roads and we're kind of ok with that. I think when that number drops to under 100 things like motorcycles will be banned because they're too dangerous.  Edit: Fun fact: There are about 28 times more cars and trucks on the road than there are motorcycles, but motorcycle riders are 5.5 times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than car and truck drivers."

The problem is when we start building more efficient systems that require computer to computer communication, and speeds increase, any human driven vehicle (car or motorcycle) will cause traffic inefficiencies. A human driven vehicle may not be able to accurately merge when vehicles are traveling at higher speeds with drafting and the distance between vehicles is much smaller."

But I think when road fatalities are a thing of the past we'll rethink allowing people to ride death machines.   Sure, most motorcycle accidents involve cars, but that doesn't mean it's the car's fault. Then what about all of the motorcycle deaths that happen just because some schmuck lost control of his bike?

It won't (usually) actually trigger a seizure, but it does cause things like dizziness, headaches, and impaired vision. I generally wear dark sunglasses in a car at night, and don't look directly out of the windows.  That would not make for very safe driving.  What I have are called absence seizures - I don't convulse, and usually anyone around me won't even notice if I am having one.  As a result of this, I was actually driving with seizures for a while without anyone noticing.  All I remember happening was I would be behind the wheel, and would seemingly lose a chunk of time.  People just kept telling me I was on ""auto-pilot"", and that happened to everyone.  As much as I kept saying ""This isn't that"", and expressed fear of being behind the wheel, no one believed me until I had my mom in the passenger seat, drove through a red light, and was completely non-responsive when she shouted at me.  I have been a big advocate for self-driving cars since I first heard the idea, but whenever I excitedly talked about them or shared any news/updates with friends and family, people tend to say the same thing: ""I wouldn't feel safe with the lack of control.""  People don't understand that this is exactly what I would feel every time I drove, and even if I someday was able to get my licence back, I would still fear a complete loss of control every time.    I know the reality of owning one is probably several years off, but if I had the chance to be a test user to one of these, I would jump on that without thinking."

I've been too scared to drive because I feel that if something were to happen I wouldn't be able to be live with myself knowing that I was negligent and being selfish driving with such a condition.

These are common, everyday scenarios.   You incorrectly assume that all humans will handle those situations perfectly and that computers won't.   I doesn't really matter whether or not a human will handle the situation perfectly. The point is that the human has autonomy over their own fate. If someone drives into a lake, that's their own fault. If an SDC drives someone into a lake while they're trapped inside screaming for the car to stop, that's going to be a problem for most people.

Why do people like you always speak ONLY from the perspective of the driver? Most people accept that their fate is sometimes on the hands of other people's decisions.  Why is the death of a passenger because of a driver's bad decision worse than a death of a passenger from a software limitation? Well, I guess if one NEVER wants to be a passenger in a car or airplane and ALWAYS wants to be the driver or pilot, I could understand it...  People like to make questions about whether SDC will apply ethics to their decisions in the case of an unavoidable accident. So, we are humans, lets talk ethics:  Would you prefer 100 deaths caused by human drivers (which include the death of other completely innocent people like pedestrians and other cars' passengers) or 50 deaths caused by SDC?

Airplane passengers can fight back against a hijacker. These aren't great options by any means, but they're better than nothing. And even in cases where a passenger has no recourse, I think people are more willing to accept death as a result of human error (since we know and accept that humans aren't perfect) than as a result of a faceless, emotionless piece of technology making a wrong decision (especially if the correct decision is obvious to the human passenger being victimized by the computer's mistake).  Maybe it isn't fair, but people have higher expectations of technology than they do of humans, especially when lives are involved.

Tack on a half hour if I have to commuter between sites (I work where I have 4 locations to visit at any given time). For the most part this time is 95% unproductive. I am able to make a couple of phone calls and answer an email here or there quickly while in bumper to bumper traffic.  But besides that my attention has to be on the road. I try to use the time to learn new things through podcasts or an e-book every now and then, but that tapers off. I've thought about systems involving carpooling and rotating shared drivers (i.e. my drive day is Monday and Wednesday and I get to work Tuesday, Thursday and Friday while other drivers take over) or even hiring someone to drive me while I commute. The math just doesn't work out in the end.   If my commuting time could be turned in to office time or even sleep time, my life would greatly improve and my productivity would skyrocket. Yes, I want a self-driving car."

SelfDrivingCars,3dped5,probabli,5,Sat Jul 18 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"How would an autonomous vehicle deal with road works where a construction worker is waving a light stick to direct cars?   It behaves appropriately. In the demo (a while back, maybe a year or so) the car just pulled over to let the human handle it while showing what it would have done, which is correctly drive as a human would.   Or alternatively, how would an autonomous car navigate a booze bus where police are directing cars off the road for breath testing?   I'm not familiar with this situation, but why would you breath test someone in a self-driving car? Presumably this is one of the niche cases they are still working out?"
SelfDrivingCars,3dped5,Kafke,3,Sat Jul 18 04:27:48 2015 UTC,"In australia the police set up a road block and pull five cars over at a time. They breath test each and then let them go and pull over another five.

Interestingly, your first comment suggests that the cars would still involve human interaction which would mean that any car would indeed need to be tested."
SelfDrivingCars,3dped5,Kafke,2,Sat Jul 18 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"Well there's still a fuckton of legal issues that need to be worked through before these things are released.  As of now, there is indeed a 'driver' who can manually take over if needed. The google car currently pulls over and lets the 'driver' take over if it's confused or not 100% certain.  In practice, google wants to make cars literally without steering wheels (fully autonomous). So naturally current road stuff would need to be worked around the idea of self-driving cars. Or these situations would need to be added to the car itself.  Again, niche cases (like what you've described) probably still need to be worked out.  Though you do bring up a good point. How do the cars respond to, say, drive throughs? Or being pulled over by the police? Or for toll roads? I imagine the devs have already thought about this stuff and have a solution.  Either way, the goal is indeed 100% autonomous driving. I'm curious to see how these more niche cases are handled."

They have demonstrated an ability to not only navigate these zones but also to recognize and understand hand signals from police officers. Their vehicles are overly cautious and safe, so will already adjust their speed appropriately.   I am sure they have many plans for private testing along with the 3 million miles they do in simulation everyday.

Adding passengers to that mix would create a massive number of problems if something went wrong in any capacity along the way.  Now on the other hand, if the transpo company owns everything due to automation, then they would be able to add a passenger cab no problem.  The biggest issue with this though is that you would need a network of these companies to agree to be a part of a service, in addition to outfitting their transpo systems with some uniform standard of cab, since all it really would take is one bad experience to burn the entire system to one customer.  It's possible, just highly unlikely that a system of long-range driverless cars wouldn't be a more successful service (you could call it Google RoadTrip or Uber Distance or LyftOff)."

SelfDrivingCars,3dkjtx,DominusFL,0,Sat Jul 18 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"The issue here is that so far I haven't seen any self-driving cars take proper defensive action when driving. We all do it. We check the car behind us before slowing down and then decide if we slow down late, flash our brake lights, or slow down early depending on how confident we are that the person behind us will stop. From this article it seems the Google self-driving car has no defensive driving capability. Had it slowed down early and then have space to speed up when the car behind seemed to be coming too close, it could have potentially evaded this accident. Or upon seeing the car behind it did not start braking appropriately, start flashing its brake lights to warn that driver. Heck, even be prepared to dash out to the breakdown lane for full evasion. I expect an ultra-alert driver to be able to do all these things. Thus, it is only fair that I would expect a self-driving car to do them too."
SelfDrivingCars,3dkjtx,modern-era,3,Fri Jul 17 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"I think avoiding low-speed collisions like this are technically impossible without a lot of false alarms. The collision was at 17 mph, so 7.5 meters/second. A car brake from that speed at around -6.6m/s2, so it can stop in 4.3 meters. This car covered those last 4.3 meters in about 0.57 seconds. I suspect that's not enough time for the Google car to process the sensor data and react... there's just too much lag. To avoid the crash, it would have to react sooner, which would lead to false alarms.  Reading back through your comment, I think your point was that you don't have to wait until that final half second to do something. I totally agree. Pro-active collision avoidance is an interesting area that Google has not discussed. If the vehicle in this scenario were instead traveling 40 mph, I'd like to think an advanced SDC would do something beyond honking its horn and flashing its lights."
SelfDrivingCars,3dn1y7,DominusFL,6,Fri Jul 17 16:33:37 2015 UTC,"You're talking envelope protection for cars. It's impossible to implement in a transparent way because the majority of human drivers does things in an unsafe manner on purpose, relying on other drivers' unwillingness to get into an accident, even if not found at fault.  By transparent I mean if the car starts slowing down (e.g. approaching a 4-way stop) even though I'm flooring it, its behavior isn't transparent. Same with going left when steering right etc.  Ironically (?) this might be possible to implement after most cars on the road are self-driving, provided there's advanced V2V/V2I. Then you should be able to run red lights (because other cars would preventively slow down) and speed down blind turns/hills because other cars would report the road is clear. By that time self driving would likely be a mandated safety feature, and this sort of behavior would probably get you automatically fined, making this mode essentially pointless."

Same with going left when steering right etc.   That's not how I think it would work (unless legally mandated). If I am trying to floor it through a 4-way stop, the car would care less UNLESS it's sensors detect that cars are approaching (or crossing not visible with enough time to stop at current speed). Then the car will ignore that input and slow it down appropriately to either stop or go through slow enough that it can insure a safe crossing, probably with some bright red lights blinking in my dash letting me know the car self-driving capability is kicking in to prevent an unsafe action. Obedience of the law remains the discretion of the driver, but safe passage is what the computer is trying to achieve.  Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication just augments its capabilities, increasing its safety factor. I can blast down a hill with blind turns to the limits of the car, computer keeping me from skidding off my lane, but I'll still hit a car that veered into my lane. V2V communication will increase the safety in that it will know that there is a car ahead in my lane and slow me down appropriately. Each innovation increasing the safety envelope.  The decision to augment the role of a self-driving car to enforce traffic laws is a whole different topic that goes beyond capability. Because technically cars could enforce quite a bit of laws today (max speed, max acceleration, lane deviation, etc.) and we choose not to mandate that."
SelfDrivingCars,3dn1y7,gfsgregresgr,5,Fri Jul 17 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"There are lots of corner cases where the sensors won't see far enough to determine if there's a 100% safe path to take. It has to deal with probabilities, and it also has to drive at an unsafe (human set) speed most of the time. It will have to slow down before passing every single driveway that's obstructed with trees etc. (because a child can run out onto the street or a car can drive out). Basically it would have to enforce a very conservative defensive driving style, whether you like it or not, or it won't be effective. There's no point in 10ms reaction time if you're going 70mph in a 45mph zone past an occluded driveway when someone drives out of it - you can't cheat physics and braking distances."

You are following the vehicle in front of you too closely. If there are all of these safety parameters that over ride your input, are you still really driving at that point."
SelfDrivingCars,3dn1y7,PaulGodsmark,6,Fri Jul 17 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"Yes - I think that you are missing the point. The greatest benefit of fully self-driving vehicles comes when we free the driver from the driving task/burden to use that time more productively/safely/sustainably.  Also there is the 'forgotten 30%' who don't have driving licences, or can't drive (disabled, too old, too poor, too young, medically-at-risk etc.), who will massively benefit from a vehicle that will be their chauffeur.

What about when your tires skid and it releases the brakes and re-engages them rapidly to grab traction back (ABS)? What about it lightly braking one wheel on one side in a tight corner when it senses you are starting to skid (cornering traction control)?  Those are all driving assist features we have today that you can't really turn off and no one seems to be complaining. I see the full intelligence as the natural result. The car intelligence kicks in when the most likely outcome would be a very undesirable catastrophe.  The upside is it makes a better driver out of everyone. Take a car today up to ""The Dragon"" in GA/TN border. One of the most dangerous curvy roads in the world. You'd only go ""so fast"" as your current ability allows. Take a smart-driving car up there it would in theory allow you to go much faster taking the car much closer to its physical limits, because it would kick in it's own smart driving features to prevent you from getting in trouble."

It's pretty much a standard feature in every new car today.  However, it's smarter than you think. It looks at the speed of your press. A panic brake is when you jam the brake super fast. Studies found that people who panic brake don't apply full pressure in 90% of the cases. So the computer takes over. If you are braking with partial pressure (intentionally) it won't read that as a panic brake, as you are not applying it fast enough."

The primary advantage of this type of vehicle is cost.   This study talks about the advantages of a purpose-specific vehicle:    The second cost column adjusts these costs for a fleet of low-cost,lightweight, electric vehicles, purpose-built for 1 to 2 occupants. We assume that these vehicles weigh 800 to 1,000 pounds, about one-fourth the weight of the typical medium-sized sedan. Vehicles that are one-fourth the mass can be estimated to cost approximately one-fourth to purchase. Therefore, $25,000 divided by 4, plus $2,500 for the driverless technology, yields a vehicle cost of about $9,000. We assume that all ownership cost categories are reduced proportionally to this reduction in vehicle cost. The reduced mass combined with improved energy efficiency from electric drive results in one-tenth the energy consumed. If we assume that they are 10 percent of the fuel cost for conventional medium sized vehicles,fuel costs for these smaller vehicles would be about $0.02 per mile...   Link to cost estimates.  You won't need to spend anywhere near $75k for these. Even if they cost a factor of 2, it won't increase the cost per mile estimates by more than about $0.06 / mile on top of the $0.15 / mile estimate."

It's a California thing. They keep coasting forward, figuring the car ahead will do the same, and then collide when the car stops.  The solution, of course, is to not follow so damned close, but there's nothing that Google can do about bumper humpers. People just need to be less shitty behind the wheel."

If they can deliver pot, they can deliver anthrax or bombs or any number of things dangerous to public health.  As supporters of SDC tech we should be facing these problems head on, which, unfortunately, will require rules for SDC taxis.  I think 1 good rule is to require the taxi operator to be responsible for anything transported in their cars. If they bare the liability, they will put measures in place (like cameras to inspect the vehicles before and after fares, or sensors to look for various toxic substances, etc) to make sure the things arent a threat to public safety. This is entirely reasonable."

With drugs there's not really much advantage to using an autonomous vehicle, as you know who arranged for the car to be sent anyway. Very little difference from today.  But you can't stop all bad things from happening. And how are you going to regulate privately owned self driving cars? You might as well shut require ISPs to be responsible for everything that happens on their network, as the Internet is used for many bad things as well.   You can't always stop bad people from using technology. It's no reason to overregulate it."

Over regulation would be not allowing things, you're not going to get fervent public adoption and you even thwart manufacturers from embracing the tech, when liability is unclear. There's literally no possible way for SDCs to exist without clear liability, and the most obvious place to put that liability is on the vehicle owner/operator.  Given this reality, no operator is going to operate an SDC without safeguards in place to make sure riders don't abuse their property. This isn't even overregulation, this is just what's going to happen. You may not realize it now, but just watch when the tech hits the market and Uber wants to use it for their service."

Of course there is, in the same way we generally exempt ISPs and web sites from what people use their networks for. Sensors and all the stuff you're talking about are ridiculously expensive, and still won't do any more to protect us than the joke that the TSA has given us. I can link up dozens of articles to show you how well that's worked if you haven't been following it.

I didn't think i had to establish how private entities can be regulated by the government, this is literally the primary purpose of government o.O  ISPs do actually have some liability in what people do on their networks, it's why it's so easy for lawyers and law enforcement to gain access to IP address records, etc.   And you're right that sensors are expensive, but that's the cost of doing business. That's what's going to push SDC ownership to a ""shared"" model for many people.   I'm not sure why you think this would be as ineffective as the TSA either. Having a manned camera check out cars from a central control room would easily be able to tell if someone leaves a suspicious package behind, just like a human driver can tell if a sketch person gets in their cab.

You don't even really need to think about the security aspect to realize SDCs will either still use a manned operator, or have other technology to monitor the cabs, for amongst other things. I'm not sure why you seem to feel so upset about this reality.  SDC operators are going to NEED to know what goes in their cars for various reasons, including public safety, which means at a minimum cameras monitored my a human, to sensors, to AI that does sentiment analysis and facial recognition and mood recognition on the passengers."

Kinda like a more detailed and precise google maps for going from A to B.

Cities make huge concessions to cars that cost in a number of ways that aren't factored in here. To name a few:     Poor land use: Cities have great real estate devoted to parking lots, which are economically neutral at best.   Runoff: The velocity of water runoff created by things like the proverbial Walmart parking lot means dramatically higher investment in flood mitigation.   Road widening: Cities spend huge amounts of money on road widening. Once SDCs become the norm, investments in road expansion will more or less go away.  Economic expansion: As self driving fleets enter cities, those cities' residents will be trading their second car miles ($0.60-$1.20 / mile) for fleet based miles ($0.30 - $0.60 / mile), which should put literally thousands of dollars back into the pockets of local citizens.

A city being dependent upon people breaking the law is not a good situation.  But perhaps the cities won't need to be dependent upon that if there are dramatic reductions in the expenses incurred by those actions - no needing to replace guard rails/telephone poles/walls/fire hydrants/traffic signals/etc. when they are hit by cars, fewer police needed to monitor traffic, etc.  I'm looking forward to an end to street sweeping tickets - no more neighborhoods lacking any available parking on certain nights because the neighboring neighborhood has street sweeping in the morning and everyone parked to avoid the morning sweeper dance.

Most comfortable trains get you close to where you want to go, but not quite there.  Example, I'm in San Jose.  I want to go to San Francisco.  I'd prefer to take the CalTrain, which is fast and efficient.  However that requires me to get to a CalTrain station, which is only accessible via a slow local rail line, or park my car at the CalTrain station and pay parking fees, assuming I can find a spot.  Once I arrive, I need to get to my destination in SF, which necessitates using a bus system with a not-great schedule, or paying for an Uber, which is pricy because of human drivers.  End result, I take the car.  On the other hand if I could get an electric taxi on the cheap to my door which drops me off at the train station right on time, and have another one pick me up EXACTLY as I arrive which takes me where I want to go, and the entire thing was booked and paid for via my phone, I would do that.

The local Grid emits about 1.8 pounds of CO2 per Kilowatt-hour of electricity delivered to my home.  I get about 4 miles per kilowatt hour.  Simple math says .45 lbs (0.204 kg) of CO2 per mile.  There are 17.68 lbs of CO2 released when burning gasoline (E10, ethanal mix).  I would get typically 25 miles per gallon in my non-electric car, so .707 lbs of CO2 released by a regular car.  Notice that is not a savings of 90%.  It is not, as some people will claim, higher for the electric than for the gas powered car, but then again, some gas powered cars get pretty good milage.  A car that gets 40 miles per gallon on E10 mix gasoline equals the CO2 of an electric car in my part of the country (unless the reporting of mix of fuels used is off).

As electric vehicles become the norm, fast charging stations like Tesla's superchargers will become more common. Tesla's new charging stations are fully solar, and the plan is to eventually make all of them solar. So that kind of covers that argument.   The other side of it, the part where self driving cars will be more efficient, is not just electric versus gas. Assuming an apples to apples comparison (electric sdv versus electric car, or gas sdv versus gas car), the sdv will tend to have higher fuel efficiency than the car driven by a human, for the same reason the sdv will have fewer accidents: it will simply be a better driver."

Do you believe that we will have enough completely solar powered chargers set up to power all the cars that are used on the roads today?   self driving cars will be more efficient,   Sure.  Okay.  I'm a much better driver than my wife, as far as efficiency goes, so I'll give you that this is a point of increased efficiency.  Still, the Leaf gets about 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour.  I can get 5 miles per kilowatt-hour by driving with the specific goal of maximizing efficiency.  This means driving around 45 miles per hour, allowing the car to slow while driving uphill (not maintaining speed), restricting speed gain while going downhill by carefully judging the length of the hill and trying to let the car hit the speed limit only when we hit the bottom of the hill, and drafting behind big vehicles (following closer than the law would actually allow).  So, in your version of the world, we replace millions of cars that normally sit in parking lots with cars that are in constant motion, picking people up and whisking them off to their destination, then driving empty to pick up the next person.  Because huge numbers of people commute at about the same time, we'd need enough self-driving cars to meet that demand, which would lead to a surplus of SDCs during off-demand periods.  We'd have to have enough solar panels generating electricity for all of the energy needs of all of those cars, and all of this will be built within the next 15 years, and all of those cars will drive so much more efficiently that the difference will be drastically better than a human driver in the same efficiency car.  Tesla can make all of their new charging stations solar because of the microscopically small percentage of the cars on the road that makes up the Tesla fleet.  Out of about 250 million passenger vehicles, Tesla has sold somewhere around 7000.  Multiply the need for solar charging stations by something like 3000 to meet the need.  Now remember that when those vehicles are charging, they are not carrying any people."
SelfDrivingCars,3d909d,deck_hand,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"The panels at Teslas charging stations have solar, but they do not provide all the power required to charge a vehicle. I think some of the self driving cars might be electric (the slower speed 2 seaters), but the majority of the 4 passenger freeway legal versions will continue to be dino powered."
SelfDrivingCars,3d909d,michelework,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"I think there may be a issue of scale, here. The article talks about ""by the year 2030"" quite a bit. Do you believe that we will have enough completely solar powered chargers set up to power all the cars that are used on the roads today?   It's really easy to forget that solar is an exponential curve like transistor technology, think about where cell phones have gone in the last 15 years and apply that to grid level technologies, going to be a fun ride."
SelfDrivingCars,3d909d,sourbrew,3,Tue Jul 14 17:38:07 2015 UTC,"It's easy to forget because it's untrue.  Solar will continue to get cheaper, but no where near the rate of increase in capacity that semi-conductor electronics have achieved.  In the last 15 years, we've gone from 15% efficiency to 20% efficiency (or so) for solar cells.  Yes, the price has come down a lot for cells, but not for the installation costs, the costs of the power converters, the cost of the insurance, the cost of the land for the panels to sit on.   When I was growing up, my grandfather bought me a Tandy computer.   16K of ram cost over $200.  Now, I can get 16 Gigabytes for less than that - a 1,000,000 fold reduction in cost.  Today, we can buy solar cells for around $1 per watt.  Solar cells at the time did not cost anything like $1,000,000 per watt.   One electric car (mine) needs about 10 kilowatt-hours per day for my own personal usage.  I get between 4 and 5 miles per kilowatt hour.  I don't think that a robo-driven car will get a great deal better than this.   So, lets say that a SDC will drive 200 miles a day in its duties, and gets 5 miles per kilowatt-hour.  That's 40 kilowatt-hours needed to charge the vehicle.  Regardless of the cost improvement that you think we'll get for solar panels, I've read some pretty good physics that suggests we're never going to get much more than 40% conversion from a solar panel, and I really doubt we'll have that in the next 15 years.  Certainly we won't if we start installing these panels in the next 5 years or so.  So, we'll go with current panels.  Solar energy experts tell me to assume 5 hours of ""full sun"" per day, on average.  We'd need enough physical panels to collect those 40 KWH in 5 hours, per vehicle.   These solar panels need to be fairly near the charger, because transmission losses over distance cuts the delivered electricity in half, meaning that distant panels would need to be able to collect 80 KWH in 5 hours per vehicle.  Do you really still feel that 15 years worth of technology improvement will make solar that much better and still allow solar to power all of the self-driving cars that would be needed for 140 million Americans to commute on a daily basis?"

Also vehicle drafting and platooning will be a thing on interstates greatly further reducing the total energy output. Imagine how ducks fly in a V pattern, the one at the front takes majority of the load allowing all the other ones behind to draft. But eventually the lead will need start conserving energy to make the full trip and goes to the back where he benefits the most from drafting. This can be further improved on by Vehicle to Vehicle communications and optimization algorithms.   On a side note: Nuclear or Thorium is really the most logical solution to be able to meet the energy output required for bringing and sustaining a near 100% Digital World Population. Space X and Google with their Project Loon will bring 1 Gbps internet to the whole world through Satellites and Balloons! Wall Street Journal - ""Google Nears $1 Billion Investment in SpaceX"".

SelfDrivingCars,3d909d,UnderdogIS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"I have no issue with the idea that SDCs will be able to improve ""per vehicle passenger rate"" or however you want to term it.  That will improve things, I'll grant you.  But... one vehicle for one person, even if it's a small vehicle, is not as efficient as one vehicle for 40 people.  I'll give you an example from real life.  I've been a motorcycle enthusiast for most of my life, and one of the things I love about them is the wonderful fuel economy I get.  Driving a regular car, I used to get about 35 miles per gallon.  Driving my motorcycle, I'd get 45 miles to the gallon.  These numbers would not change much if I were alone or if I were bringing my wife along.  I also have a very small and fairly slow scooter.  I can drive it up to about 60 miles per hour, but that's really pushing it hard, and I normally drive between 40 and 55 miles per hour.  I stick to the ""surface streets,"" which is anything but Interstate.  When I'm driving it around 45 miles per hour, I get around 95 mpg.  Why do I get twice the milage on the scooter as I do on a big bike?  Because of the amount of power the little bike can produce, and the difference in weight, aerodynamic drag and acceleration.  Now, there are some cars that get as good in gas milage as your average motorcycle.  They have four seats and are a great deal heavier but are optimized for low drag, so they compensate for the extra weight.  They also accelerate much more slowly (power to weight ratio is smaller).  If you optimize the shape of a small, 2 seat car, I can see the MPG going up to or even surpassing that of my little scooter, so long as MPG is your goal, and not speed or acceleration.  I would not need a ""self driving car"" to draft behind a large wind break, just a ""follow mode"" on my accelerator.  Cars on the market today already have this available.  I looked at a Jeep Grand Cherokee last fall that has that feature.  It will allow you to set a distance behind the car in front of you, and set the cruise control.  If the car in front slows down, so with your car.  When that car speeds up, so will your car.  A SDC will automate this, and make it even safer, lowering the fuel requirement of every car that has this feature.  If the car is electric, the car will excel in miles per kilowatt by using this feature, whether it's fully self driving or just has a ""follow me"" mode for Interstate driving, or even if it has a ""draft mode"" on cruise control, with a human steering it.  None of this, however, has anything to do with the comment I made about solar power growing fast enough in the next 15 years to handle all vehicles on the road."

But, since he thinks exponential growth continues without bounds until 100% of all other energy sources are converted to solar, then it must be so.  Just think, he said that it doubles every two years, and there will be eight doublings.  That means that 50% of the planet's energy needs will be satisfied by solar power built in the final TWO YEARS of the conversion.  I'm amazed.  Really, that will be quite a thing.

SelfDrivingCars,3d909d,michelework,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"There is significant variability depending on type of technology, location (in terms of geography and subsidies), and scale (residential, commercial, or utility) but here's a recent article I read that gives some insight.  The cheapest in the US according to the article and to the best of my knowledge is a NV utility selling at $0.0387/kWh.  A number of larger projects in the SW are already near or past grid parity and Hawaii has been there for a number of years now.  The US as a whole along with most of the world has been projected to reach that point (which does not include subsidies) in 2017 according to a number of projections including one earlier this year by Deutsche Bank.    The chart in that article unfortunately only goes up to 2013, but shows the cost difference between, and trends among, the different installation scales.  There is a pretty dramatic drop for just the 2007-2013 period.  This page goes into more detail on the cost breakdown for utility scale PV over 2010-2013.  Just in that short time frame the cost/kWh was almost cut in half.  I couldn't really say with confidence what the national average is today because my company only operates regionally, but I can say that the overall trend has continued.  It won't go to zero obviously and the drops won't be so dramatic too much longer, but from what I've seen the Deutsche Bank estimate is on the money."

This was at a public art school, on the sidewalk/entrance area. They are required to have controls, but pedals and steering wheels may not be as strictly defined legally as we would think. IANAL, but here goes:  The car can only go 25mph. There are many vehicles that only go 25mph, like scooters, small motor bikes, etc., that are allowed on the road, and obviously don't have the same traditional controls like a wheel shaped steering wheel and a foot pedal. If I get some time later, I'll dig into the CA state laws. But from what I was told at the event, this is indeed one of the cars that can drive on the road. And again, you couldn't fit a steering wheel in there correctly. Pedals, sure, but not a traditional wheel. I do agree that this is strange and I agree with your skepticism. Worth investigating more.

If a bus has, say 40 seats, but spends a good deal of its time with 20 or less passengers, a handful of lightweight 2-4 seat vehicles could do the same job, consuming less energy, taking up less room, and putting massively less wear on the roads.

""Thinking ahead, Mercedes is already working to develop protocols for the car to hand control back to the driver, he says. With today's hands-on laws, this is simple he says.

This is a feature every car, autonomous or not, should have.   Recent ideas in driver assistance system involve monitoring driver health to assess whether they can effectively drive. Specifically, some involve watching elderly drivers to catch cases of dozing off, or health emergencies. The mitigation to these events is to signal the car to pull over.   So, that's a feature that has benefits for most levels of autonomy. Eventually, once the car no longer needs the driver, this might not be as great of a feature, but for now, it's essential."

SelfDrivingCars,3ctp4u,JoseJimeniz,16,Fri Jul 10 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"Imagine you’re riding in an autonomous car down a narrow 2-lane road with a double-yellow center line. Suddenly you come upon a stalled car in your lane. How long does the self-driving car wait until it decides it is okay to break the law and cross the lines to pass?   I don't accept the premise; it is not illegal to cross a double-yellow center line.   Here’s an even tougher scenario: An out-of-control trolley with five people onboard is directly in the robot car’s path. The only way to avoid it is to swerve and run down a pedestrian. Does the autonomous car choose the lesser of two evils, or smash into the trolley?   Given the contrived situation, the car drives into the trolley. The car shall not leave the lane unless it is safe to do so. The car shall not make ethical decisions.   Autonomous cars do not need ethics or morals.  And i'm really tired of these articles. We get it, you're a philosopher. Go away. The answer is always:   Yes, the car will kill people.   To quote me:   They're getting run over.  I'm not saying that like it's a good thing, or something we should strive for.  Of course the car will slam on its brakes. But the hypothetical is that the car cannot stop in time. The child will get run down.   Which is exactly what would happen if i were driving. I would do the best I can, but the reality is i'm not going to drive into an incoming tractor trailer, or onto the sidewalk.  The child is getting run over.   In the end it is an unfortunate accident. Because the car was autonomous doesn't change that.     Edit:  There's a concept that people are going to have to get used to with self driving cars.   Self-driving cars are much safer than human drivers. Each year 30,000 people in the US, and over a million worldwide, die in car accidents. If everyone switched to self driving cars, and we could cut that number in half, that would be an extraordinary success.   Here comes the part that people need to get next to:    15,000 people a year in the US, and 500 thousand worldwide, would still die in a self-driving car   You have two alternatives:    30,000 people a year die in car accidents  15,000 people a year die in case accidents   The lower number is better. Saving 15,000 lives is what we want to do. The lower number is what we want.    We want 15,000 people a year to die in self driving cars.    Self driving cars don't have to be perfect; nor will they ever be. They just have to be better than humans.  And we're arguing over the piddly edge cases as if they mean something.  A car is not allowed to leave it's lane unless it is safe to do so. That means:   a car driven by a human is not allowed to leave its lane unless it is safe to do so a car driven by a computer is not allowed to leave its lane unless it is safe to do so   You don't avoid accidents by causing accidents. The head-on accident is better than the side-swipe accident. And hitting a stationary car, is better than having a head-on collision in the oncoming lane. (i.e. the devil you know beat the devil you don't)  And besides: you don't leave you lane unless it is safe to do so. And you don't drive onto a sidewalk or into a building.  If you are faced with the decision of (being unable to stop) and:   hitting a family of four driving onto the sidewalk and hitting a homeless drug dealing murderer pedophile   You run down the familiy of four.  You don't leave your lane."

Given the contrived situation, the car drives into the trolley. The car shall not leave the lane unless it is safe to do so. The car shall not make ethical decisions.    As I was trained, the action for human drivers is the same. Stay in the lane and slow down as much as possible. I can't imagine early SDCs to be any different. Speed is almost always the most dangerous factor, and swerving more often than not makes things worse.  It needs to be said every time this argument comes. SDCs don't need to be better than the best human driver, only better than the average driver. The average driver is unlikely to respond well in the above scenario."

Edit: Oh, and i forgot this:   It's absolutely illegal to cross a double yellow in several states.   If it's illegal to cross a double yellow line in several states, and there is a broken down car in front of you, what is a human driver supposed to do?

SelfDrivingCars,3ctp4u,Calamity_Jesus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"The whole problem with laws is that when they are written, it's difficult to anticipate every potential problem. They just changed the law in Virginia that allowed you to pass a cyclist on a double yellow. Before this, technically you were supposed to follow for as long as it took. No one did this in practice, and I'm sure it was rarely enforced, but then you're asking engineers to decide which laws to obey and which to ignore. And there's certainly an ethical component to this.  And I just completely disagree with you about the sidewalk example.   And anytime anyone wants to pose a hypothetical about what a driverless car should do, ask what a human driver should do. Hint: It's the answer that makes you uncomfortable.   I'm not sure I follow. Humans disagree about the right thing to do here, e.g. you and me on the sidewalk example. You could have vehicles all do what their human passenger's prefer, but you have the challenge of understanding what their driver would do in a wide range of situations. And when there's no passenger, then I imagine the owner makes the call, and this could be a corporation. I think what you're actually trying to do is imply that whatever a human would actually do in an emergency (not their preference) is far worse than a computer because we panic and have slow reaction times and whatever. And yes, this is true, but I hold that it does not justify ignoring the problem entirely. The goal is to be as safe as possible, not just slightly better than the typical human.  Anyway, I thought about it more and you made a good point that this sub is totally uninterested in ethical problems. And recently, it's uninterested in any and all problems with SDCs, reframing them as merely problems that will eventually be solved in the near future so why bother discussing them. Same goes for all discussions of potential regulation.

One thing that SDCs are supposed to not do that almost every human driver does is drive beyond their ability to safely respond to situations and avoid accidents.  In this iteration of the Kobiashi Maru the SDC has been given the ability to tell how many passengers are in the trolley, yet doesn't have the ability to tell that the trolley is headed for it at an unsafe speed until it is too late to do anything but choose to hit either the trolley or a pedestrian?  It's not realistic to make them both omniscient and helpless.   because aggressive taxi drivers would quickly learn to exploit its algorithms   I'd love to see SDCs at some point be designed to communicate and cooperate to punish aggressive and dangerous drivers by boxing them in and hampering their progress for a bit and lay off when they start driving in a more courteous and safe manner.

Then there's the kids today who will just never experience driving, and won't really be incentivized to go through the hassle and high upfront costs of buying a new car   That gets much murkier faster. In some places I expect the cost of a SDC rental style usage to be much higher than you'd see elsewhere.  Thats a common issue where I live, people wonder why we don't use public transit or taxi's here. Because the city is HUGE and spread out, and there are many many like that opposed to NY/LA style where everyones crammed together. (Lots of SE asia will be ripe for conquest though..) So a Taxi ride anywhere at all is like 25$ in a lot of cases. Bus service is awful and takes hours to cover even a tiny bit of ground. Sidewalks? (LOL) Bikepaths? (LOL) we have some of these things but you better live DAMN close to the cities heart.   Finally, at the tail end you have this small segment driving hipsters who will resist.   They'll likely be forced to stop due to safety concerns. Especially once SDC's become the standard.  Last, I really don't think everyone will be cool with renting. Some people just don't/won't see the value, or see the convenience cost as being far too high. (Where I live, it probably would be a nuisance and involve lots of preplanning to use effectively.

To put it another way, I'm pretty sure that individual variable speed capability will just slow down things for everyone. Even the low end SDCs should be capable of achieving necessary performance, and above that won't likely be safe or beneficial.  Maybe, I don't know. But I doubt it will be like now, where I need that horsepower to blow past someone when merging.

Furthermore I've never owned a car--and I've owned some crappy ass vehicles too--that wasn't capable of driving up to the limits of the law.

So you want to go fast, SDCs are safer at high speeds than humans are, but they still have risks so you need special insurance and licenses. That way if you hit someone, you and the auto maker have your asses covered.  You get in your car and instead of giving it a location, you tell it you want a ""performance experience"". It seeks out areas that don't have much traffic, but had ""fun"" road conditions and takes off.  You reach the edge of nowhere, suddenly you hear a second electric motor engage and your now wallpapered to the seat. The thrilling speed and tight cornering bundled with the absolute lack of control is thrilling. In reality the computer on-board is very carefully adjusting acceleration and braking along with information about the road surface from the highway department, if and how wet the road surface is, the temperature and humidity, the exact tire pressure and so on.

Maybe people will still own individual vehicles and while they are at work their car will be dropping off/picking up dry-cleaning, or going to an amazon warehouse to pick up their recent book/movie order, or getting the ingredients for dinner from a half dozen boutique suppliers all over the city.

Cars servicing suburban customers will likely become faster and faster and more self-driving cars hit the road. The speed limits here in Texas go as high as 85.

A lot of the wear and tear on a conventional car happens while it's sitting still, as it does for 95% of it's 18 year life span.   While certain components degrade while sitting still, it's silly to think that ""a lot"" of a car's wear and tear comes from sitting still.

Additionally, autonomous car sharing services will buy in bulk and pay less than a consumer walking onto a car lot (for example, Uber is not going to be paying MSRP if/when they buy 500k Teslas).  And then we have car dealerships.  Tesla is already shaking that up with their direct to consumer sales, and they are being met with huge resistance from the middlemen that want to maintain their status quo.  I would be very interested in seeing actual statistics on how longevity is affected by sharing (both with combustion powered cars and electric).  Taxis would probably be a good place to start, but then we also have to consider other benefits of autonomous cars such as nearly infallible maintenance scheduling, problem detection and self-troubleshooting, more efficient driving habits/programming, fewer accidents, and other aspects that might prolong the life of the car."

If you have better figures based on more solid scientific projections that I haven’t had time to research fully I’d love to hear them but based on some other papers I have read the figures I have arrived at are definitely near to reality.   It might not be the best article, but they do a decent job presenting their case with well sourced claims and fairly reasonable assumptions that are presented as such.  The conclusion may more hard-edged than you'd prefer, but I don't think that's a good reason to write off the entire article as bullshit.

They can walk, hop on a bus, take a taxi, bikeshare, trains, get in a UberPool, etc ..... and even other forms of transport we haven't invented yet like hyperloop, drone-taxis and so forth.  The instance of SOVs driving all over town will drop significantly.  The reality of a driver being completely tied to their personal vehicle will be broken.

Require the teams to have different basic strategies to give them more uniqueness.  Throw in a ton of support encouraging heavy betting, even amongst the teams themselves. So that you have skin in the game. Keeping interest high.  I think if you asked the average nascar viewer if they'd get bored watching a robot car ram another one at 500mph in a corkscrew when they have a grand on the line, they'd probably think you were crazy.

It turned out that the best way was a combination of the two.

I'm not necessarily suggesting that a quadruped is the correct solution, just pointing out that we can explore solutions outside of the traditional design of an automobile."
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,BeriAlpha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:29:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of picking on the camel idea, sure, and I know there are other more feasible solutions, but it sort of serves as an exaggerated example of problems with that sort of solution. To add a camel to a car, the mechanisms for that camel to work need to exist. And given that that camel needs to lift an entire car, probably almost two tonnes (the Holden VF Commodore, a recent Australian sedan, weighs up to 1,780 kg depending on the exact configuration), means that the camel is going to need to be a big, sturdy, slow goddamn tank of a camel. Now that, in turn, means that your one-and-a-half tonne sedan is going to need to be heavier and bulkier in turn to not collapse under the weight and then the camel itself would need to be even more tankier and so on and so forth, but more importantly than that, fitting the camel in is going to fundamentally change the way the car works, make give it a lot more points of failure, and so on and so forth.  Now think for a moment about how frequently you actually encounter snowy or icy roads. Huge, complex, radical design changes that would be so incredibly expensive and such and so forth aren't worth it for the small pay-off.  Especially because we already have a perfectly good solution for snow-covered roads, that self-driving cars can adopt as well:  Snow chains. Just pull over and tell the human passengers that they're gonna need to get their hands dirty.  Complex solutions are great to explore, sure. And there may come a day where we find camels to be practical solutions, because of advancements in manufacturing and such and so forth that make intricate, complex systems trivially simple to our great great great grandchildren. And maybe the sky-high balloons of today will help guide the people who make those advancements, and such and so forth.  But at the same time, for solving problems today, it's worth keeping one foot on the ground. As the urban myth goes, sometimes it pays to not develop space pens when pencils will do the job."
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,ChemicalRascal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we're both stating the merits of different simple principles, and they're not mutually exclusive.  Focus on simple solutions that work instead of searching for complex solutions? Good.  Keeping ourselves open to experimentation, and not just relying on existing solutions because that's the way it's always been done? Good.  I'm also glad you brought up the 'Russian Space Pencil' story, because it's actually an example of a false urban legend, and one that goes against the idea of just doing what we've always done. Both the US and Russian space programs stopped using pencils pretty early because floating pieces of broken lead were a hazard. Instead, we developed a different simple solution, a pressurized pen cartridge. So in the end, the US space program followed both of our principles: it found a simple solution, but it did so by rejecting the obvious and accepted answer."
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,BeriAlpha,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:27:46 2015 UTC,"It seems we agree on the main point, so awesome, but just on the space pens: I know it's an urban legend. Indeed, I also know that due to the dangers of graphite and such, the Russians moved to grease pencils and whiteboards for a while. (Maybe the US did as well, I don't know). But it's important to note here that the space pen, the pressurised pen cartridge, was not developed by the United States space program, but entirely unprompted by a private entity.  Did NASA use the pens? Yes, of course. They bought a bunch for the Apollo program, at the cost of six dollars per.  The Soviet Union apparently bought a bunch as well."

I don't know if they will be tested in those conditions in a while. Aside from the obvious sight problem, there's an even worse physics problem.   The fact is icy and snowy conditions are just as unsafe to drive in as they are to fly in. I think there's too much liability in snow because the car could do everything right and still easily get in an accident if there is no traction. If I was building a SDC I'd make it disable itself in the snow and ice for safety's sake."

SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,Ambiwlans,3,Thu Jul 9 02:25:20 2015 UTC,Snow changes the terrain. Seeing through it isn't the main point.
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,SplitReality,2,Thu Jul 9 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"Good point, but it was a major issue. I think the terrain issue could be solved in three ways. First keep the automated fleets running during storms and have some portion of cars equipped with plows. That should keep the lanes clear.   Second, add the ability to update maps in real time. The snow should accumulate in repeatable and predicable patterns so it shouldn't be as hard as it sounds to detect the changes over time. In addition vertical structures like street lights, buildings, and trees should still remain visible and mostly unchanged.  Position algorithms should also be able to make use of the tire ruts created by cars driving through the snow.  Third, the driving routes could be altered to account for the snow. Difficult areas with few vertical landmarks could be avoided. Fewer lanes could be used closer to the right side of the road to increase the separation of cars, allow cars to get better position cues from the side of the road, and help keep those lanes clear of snow with increased traffic."
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,Ambiwlans,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:29 2015 UTC,That should keep the lanes clear.   Relying on an unreliable thing is going to screw you though.  It is a solvable problem but it'll take a while. I wish they'd start on it sooner.
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,SplitReality,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:30 2015 UTC,How is having automated cars with plows unreliable? On top of that you would have the automated cars without plows also runing. And on top of that you would still have the normal human driven plows? With all of that running we'd have far better snow removal capabilities than we currently do.  Add to that we give the cars the same strategies humans use to deal with snow covered streets. Follow the car in front of you. Follow the ruts created in the snow created by car tires. And so on.
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,Ambiwlans,2,Thu Jul 9 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"Can you 100% guarantee it? If no, it is not reliable.  You can't have cars rely on something that is intrinsically unreliable for their safety.  The current approach to SDCs is to assume no infrastructure since that assumption would cause them to fail.  Cars can't even rely on signage or people following the law and be safe. They certainly can't assume an always cleared road surface.  Additionally, plows don't always clear the whole road. Sometimes they'll clear one lane etc.  I'm assuming you don't live in a snowy country so you have no idea what logistical issues are involved in driving in a place that gets a meter in a few hours."
SelfDrivingCars,3cmfx7,SplitReality,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"A 100% guarantee is a strawman. Can you 100% guarantee that human drivers are reliable. The cars don't have to be perfect they just have to be better than humans.  Uber is pledging to buy 500,000 SDCs in 2020. That is just one company and that is instant infrastructure.   SDCs would not have to rely on clear road surfaces. I said that with their use the roads would be kept clearer than they are now. However I also said that the cars could use the same cues as humans do to drive in the snow like following the car in front of them or the ruts in the road. And I mentioned that certain terrain will be invariant in a snow storm like street lights, buildings, and trees. I also mentioned that the algorithms could be given the capability to be updated based on snow accumulation models and current sensory data.  In fact my entire discussion on this has basically been about how SDCs could drive in the snow. Only a small part of it mentioned that the roads would be clearer due to their use.  As for heavy snows, self driving fleets will likely be deployed in more temperate cities first and progress to harsher and harsher environments. So the cars will get a chance to prove themselves and figure out what works best over time. However with cars being able to see through snow, they will be able to see better than humans in those conditions.   As I said before, they just need to be given the same techniques humans use to deal with adverse conditions. And how to do that is already just about a solved issue. We need to collect more data on humans driving in adverse conditions in order to train the machine learning algorithms better. One of the main reasons why SDCs don't work in the snow yet is because no one is currently teaching them to do it. They are currently working on problems like dealing with construction sites and policemen directing traffic.  Edit: Not to belittle the problem but it just occurred to me that with plows building up walls of snow to the sides of the road, and with the cars ability to see through the falling snow, making SDCs work in the snow could be a much easier task than it first seems. After all, at that point you are driving down a walled corridor. The car could use the piled up snow itself to determine its relative position in the road."

I know that SDC are still a few years down the road. Yes, as of right now, Google has no direct access to anything Facebook is doing. However, the nature of computer and computer algorithms is that it's hard to be the very first one to program / discover something, but it's really easy to find out what someone has done and copy it. What Facebook is doing will eventually propagate outside of Facebook, to Google, to all of Silicon Valley and even to Universities. It's plausible that some things that Facebook has done have come from research from Universities and is already freely available in white papers.   The head guy who worked at Microsoft speech eventually worked on SIRI. (Don't knock MS's research department, they're like Xerox in the 80's, they seem to be way advanced, but fail terribly at bring products to the market)  Likewise, we can easily argue that Bing! takes many, many ideas from Google Search, because it's closer to Google Search than not.  The Android hardware started its life as a Blackberry clone, but became HEAVILY inspired by iPhone pretty rapidly, even solving some issues that iOS had with touch.  That is the nature of tech industry. Information wants to be free.   EDIT: Somehow my edit didn't come through.

Announce 100 cities, see which ones will allow the service and announce your manufacturer and say the cars will start rolling off the assembly line in 12 months or 18 month. 6 months later announce the final cities that made the cut, maybe 50 cities and go map those cities.  Also at that time announce a second wave of 50-100 cities eligible for service once all the first wave cities have their fleets up and running.

What this guy is predicting isn't robotaxis as we fully expect them to be eventually (i.e. able to jump on highways, etc.).  He says that he expects them to max out at 25 mph and be a small fleet for public transportation in a public-private partnership.  He also clarifies that he is talking about cars that are fully autonomous and lack a steering wheel, pedals, etc.  I have to assume he is talking about Google.  Google has already shown that its cars can operate without steering equipment.  They are currently testing prototypes with steering equipment per CA regulations.  It seems reasonable that they would be able, within 3 years, to feel confident with their testing, remove the steering equipment, and make a deal with the government of Mountain View or where ever to run them as a free local public transport service.  This also assumes that CA can pass rules for autonomous vehicles, but I think that is certainly possible in that time frame as well (especially if it is only for low speed vehicles).  At this point, they would not be prototypes, and I would indeed be satisfied.  Is there anything in that scenario that seems impossible to you?"
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,qurun,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:42 2015 UTC,"Google has already shown that its cars can operate without steering equipment.    Not really.  In their latest monthly report, they said that their cars are being driven 1 mile by humans for every 2.3 self-driven miles (i.e., 30% of miles are driven by humans).  Maybe this is out of an abundance of caution, but there is no strong evidence that Google is ready to take the steering wheels out.     It seems reasonable that they would be able, within 3 years, to feel confident with their testing, remove the steering equipment, and make a deal with the government of Mountain View or where ever to run them as a free local public transport service...  Is there anything in that scenario that seems impossible to you?   I don't think this sounds reasonable.  I don't think three years is long enough to solve the technical problems they are facing, let alone long enough to build up a strong enough safety record for public deployment.    However, almost anything is possible.  I admit that it is hard to predict the pace of technology, but for perspective it has been ten years since the second DARPA Grand Challenge.  The only thing you wrote that does sound impossible to me is that Google will run their taxi service for free. ;)"
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,madcuzimflagrant,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:39:37 2015 UTC,"When I say they have shown the cars operate without steering equipment, I mean the video they posted a while back on the closed track that literally had no steering equipment.  They are not legally allowed to have those on public roads currently.  I simply meant to show that they've demonstrated an example of their vehicle operating without any rider steering interface.  It's true 30% manual use is still pretty high, but it is not clear what the reasoning is here.  It may be an abundance of caution, it may be a lack of ability, or it may even be that they want the car to learn from the choices of the driver which they've said they have done.  They haven't detailed any of that unfortunately, so what percentage of that 30% is a real obstacle for them is a pretty big unknown.  I'm obviously on the more optimistic side of it.   I don't think three years is long enough to solve the technical problems they are facing,    Anything specific you think they won't get done in that timeframe?  I can think of some larger challenges to rolling out in different geographies and municipalities, but nothing strikes me as limiting to that extent for a limited local debut in that time.   let alone long enough to build up a strong enough safety record for public deployment.   Are you saying that in terms of Google limiting themselves, or CA not approving their deployment?  What do you think would be an adequate threshold for this?   The only thing you wrote that does sound impossible to me is that Google will run their taxi service for free.   Long term they definitely won't, but I think the very initial run will either be free or virtually free.  They don't need to worry about monetizing until they start ramping up numbers and rolling out to numerous cities (or license, or whatever they end up actually doing)."
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,mrdavisclothing,3,Thu Jul 9 07:16:44 2015 UTC,"2017 to 2018 is very realistic for public / private partnerships at sub-30 mph. While the controlled testing Google is currently doing in Mountain View and Austin will help, they (and others) will need to roll out in smaller municipalities whose traffic grids can accommodate 1,000+ SDCs without affecting current flow."
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,qurun,0,Wed Jul 8 12:41:24 2015 UTC,"Why would they need to roll out somewhere else, where they don't have engineers to support the vehicles? That sounds unlikely."
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,mrdavisclothing,2,Wed Jul 8 14:47:42 2015 UTC,"As you suggest, I think we'll see a continued increase in the number of vehicles that they are testing in MV for the next few years.   In terms of commercialization and deployments of actual fleets though, I suspect providers like Google will need to first target markets whose road systems will tolerate thousands of vehicles traveling at 25 mph without disrupting normal traffic flow. The slower vehicles are far less expensive than their sedan equivalent counterparts and accidents at lower speeds are far less impactful.  Some dense urban environments like SF and NYC could qualify, but companies looking to deploy SDC fleets will face a lot of regulatory hurdles, labor backlash and incumbent competition in those markets.   The ideal early candidate cities will have   Mostly low speed roads and average trip speeds under 30mph, preferably lower. Young, tech-friendly demographics.  A friendly state legislature.  No incumbent public transportation.  Anchor tenants willing to subsidize early usage. Population density above 1,500 / square mile.  Inexpensive electricity.   This doesn't mean that Google and others won't continue to test in their own backyards while gathering data. But to roll out a functional fleet in Mountain View or Austin would likely require a significant number - perhaps a majority -of the vehicles to be sedan-equivalent vehicles to accommodate the higher speed requirements.   Assuming average population densities (e.g. outside of dense urban centers) the cost expands faster than linearly as a function of service area because you need more and different types of vehicles to be able to provide acceptable wait times. This means a deployment in a larger city will cost a lot more.   A small city with the characteristics I mention above could start with a fleet of around 1,000 ""Google cars"" to provide sub 2 minute wait times during peak demand. At say 10k / car, that's an up front capital investment of $10,000,000 to get real operational data.   A city the size of Austin would likely require 10,000 cars at least to provide city wide coverage and sub 5 minute wait times, and figure half of those would cost $25k each. That's an initial capital investment of $175,000,000. The payout will certainly justify it, but I don't see why Google and others wouldn't start with the smaller cities first before committing to larger more complex environments, especially since manufacturing the larger sedan equivalent vehicles will require more engineering runway."
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,qurun,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"A city that's densely populated, but is small and isolated so people aren't commuting away?  A city that is progressive, and yet has no public transportation?  I don't think it exists.    Let's add to the list some more items:    Good weather.  Snow in particular is a huge problem for the technology, which they haven't even started trying to address.   A friendly local government with which Google has a good relationship.  California has a friendly state legislature, but for driving around town you are mostly dealing with the local politics.  Since you can't get a good local relationship starting from nothing, this limits you to cities where Google has an office.   A natural way of rolling out the system.  They aren't going to have 10,000 cars available to everyone with sub 5 minute wait times from day one.  They'll start with it limited to employees, then more employees, then family of employees, then eventually a limited public, then more, then more.  If Google has an office there, then they can start with their own employees.   A local team of engineers.  If the rollout is away from Mountain View, then Urmson and a large team is probably going to have to relocate there or nearby.  This isn't so easy, but again limits you to cities where Google already has an office.     Yet another advantage of Mountain View is that they have already started testing there.  This means that they are already getting local drivers used to their cars, and that they are already talking to the local community and to local and state politicians.    The only comparable locations in the US are San Francisco and Venice (Los Angeles), which are both harder locations than Mountain View---worse traffic, longer commutes, trickier politics.  There are places like Madison, WI, Boulder, CO and Cambridge, MA that are eliminated by the weather, and not much more.  Obviously, in the next five years, Google might open offices elsewhere (perhaps Santa Barbara, CA?), but here are the options now:   http://www.google.com/about/company/facts/locations/"
SelfDrivingCars,3cgyyp,mrdavisclothing,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about weather and the friendly local government, but I don't agree about some of the other points.   Engineers will be needed for a bit to do ridealongs, but once they ""push to prod"" 500 will be a bare minimum for an actual rollout. It's probably closer to 1,000. To do that you need to have a minimum expectation of 10,000 paying customers out of the gate to get the numbers working in your favor to do a real test.   So you are now looking at small free-standing college towns South of 36 degrees latitude with progressive local governments."

It seems to me like a good public transportation system is a good thing for Google.  For example, it means that there is an audience of commuters who don't already have their own cars---and who naturally will want to sign up.  It also means that if Google's cars have to be taken down (bad weather, software problem, even a legal problem), there's an alternative for the users."

A white paper that analyzed an early roll out in Ann Arbor cited the presence of an existing transit authority as a potential barrier due to the conservative oversight they introduce to the process:    ""...another significant barrier to any deployment where the vehicles would be owned and operated by AAATA is that the project would be subject to a relatively conservative and slow-moving planning and funding process which requires the cooperation of a large number of stakeholders.""

And the rest will fall like dominoes.   I'm skeptical though that any company will have fully autonomous vehicles in mass production by that time. Unless Google actually does have an active manufacturing partnership with GM. Because really the only thing GM has said about vehicle autonomy is 'well, yes Google, we're interested in a parternship if you'll have us', and that was in January, and no public statement on the matter has been made since."

It's exciting, when I first started following a few years ago I had a few theories about how SDC rollout would go. I didn't have much confidence in any one theory, but they were all plausible. Now, I'm 90% confident this is how the initial roll-outs will go - Fleet style run by central company, limited network of roads, 25 MPH vehicles running on roads with posted speed limits of up to 35 MPH, transportation on demand acting as the ""last mile"" between people's home/work and a train or bus. To me, this is the most logical way forward. It's exactly the slow/careful baby-step that will get the public familiar with the idea of SDC's, and from there, it will snowball rapidly."

But the real acid test will be unmanned testing, if that happens for a few months continuously in a given area,  well, commercial introduction may happen faster.   This is why I an so excited (hopefully) to be going to the formal opening of the new Ann Arbor test track.  This will hopefully allow developers a chance to run their vehicles 24/7 unmanned, to prove that these systems work.  I believe this first will happen.   First to go fully driverless will be highway pilot,  between slip roads or service stations, where they will have to come to a complete stop.  Again Unmanned testing will be the real test of the system."

SelfDrivingCars,3cccww,iteotwawkiaiff,5,Mon Jul 6 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"I develop embedded multi-baseline stereo vision systems as part of my day job. The major issue with this approach vs lidar is that camera based depth in this scenario will be extremely computationally intensive. The system will need to operate at at least 120fps, and that means in each 8ms window, the system must:   compute disparity/depth from at least 6 camera pairs with a very wide search range (disparity could be anywhere from zero to say, 500 pixels for any pixel in the image). At 1080P, assuming a 10% sparse fill rate, that is 2mpX0.1X500X6X120fps = 7.2Billion matching operations per second.  Then you must merge the data from these camera pairs into the same coordinate system to create a 3d field Then you must compare to the previous frame(s) data, remove outliers, analyze changes in vehicle position, identify any new potential obstacles, and make a course determination And you must not screw up.  All this must happen every 8ms. If you don't run into memory latency or threading issues, which you certainly will, this would require a rather intense GPU compute cluster in the vehicle.    The second issue is how to ensure accurate calibration of the multi-baseline system in an environment as rigorous as a car, especially since the software will be making life and death decisions based on these assumptions of accuracy. I have done lots of work on this topic that I cannot publicly disclose, but suffice it to say that given how critical the accuracy is here, this is a serious issue that needs to be resolved.   Environmental stability must also be considered. What happens in the rain or snow with a camera based approach? What happens if a bird drops a turd over one of the camera openings? It's very easy to blind a camera based system.   While Lidar is expensive, it does overcome many of these challenges, most principally the fact that producing an accurate, 360 degree depth map with low latency does not require much computational overhead, freeing up your compute resources to deal with the actual problem at hand: making life and death decisions regarding the trajectory of the vehicle. Camera based solutions just introduce too much compute latency into an already critical path, and suffer from too many potential malfunctions to be viable for complete car control at highway speed."

Unknown - is that viable if there is a sudden loss of vehicle control and the shift between frames is more than expected? The inherent problem here is that you are still relying on software to form your understanding of the space around you, and this software has limitations. What happens when you drive by a shiny car, for example? The specular reflections will cause chaos in the stereo algorithm.    There's a rigid metal frame all the cameras seem to be mounted to. Not good enough?   Nope. You must assume the cameras will move slightly, It is very difficult to completely constrain rotational motion over the scale of something like a car. Cars themselves are not perfectly stiff and will slightly yaw from side to side in a turn. And there are all kinds of vibrational impacts that will manifest in the vision system.  For example, in a 1080P stereo vision system with a 0.5m baseline and 75 degree FOV, a rotation of 0.1 degree in either camera will result in a ~25% measurement error at a 50m distance. To keep the error below 2% (which one could argue is still unacceptable), rotation would need to be constrained to within .01 degree over the life of the vehicle. So the simple answer is that a mechanical solution is practically impossible - you need an active alignment software subsystem that measures and accounts for this error in a robust way (harder than it sounds)."
SelfDrivingCars,3cccww,madmax_br5,2,Tue Jul 7 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"Lots to chew on! Obviously you've given this a lot of hard work and thought.   Unknown - is that viable if there is a sudden loss of vehicle control and the shift between frames is more than expected?   A linear pixel search might take longer if it's not near the expected location, but as you said it still has a finite bound. You just size your ASIC for the worst-case, no?  If you have an IMU for sensor fusion (which Tesla does), it's updating much more often than every 8 milliseconds, so a sudden change in vehicle orientation or velocity should be detectable directly.  Yes, I believe some sort of camera pointing auto-calibration (using a SLAM-like algorithm) is possible. But look again at at how rigid that box frame is. Once calibrated at the factory with a test card/jig, I have a hard time seeing those shift w/r/t each-other in anything other than a car accident. In which case the car could just display the ""Autopilot disabled. Please contact Tesla service."" message."

In which case the car could just display the ""Autopilot disabled. Please contact Tesla service."" message.   On thermal expansion alone this will fail - even mounted into a solid bar of metal, as it microscopically expands and contracts with temperature variations this will cause rotations that are large enough to substantially degrade accuracy. Not trying to be a naysayer, I have simply seen this happen firsthand when trying to deploy vision systems into real products. Even a 0.1 degree threshold is extremely challenging to even measure. If the camera is a 1"" cube, a 0.1 degree rotation is pitch change of about a thousandth of an inch. And that was for 25% error @ 50m! We said that .01degree, which is about 2.5% error @ 50m, is probably about the limit of acceptability. So this would mean all the cameras in the system must maintain their pose to within one ten thousandth of an inch over the life of the vehicle, which simply is not possible. A software Ransac and pose re-estimation system is needed to correct for these small fluctuations on an ongoing basis.   It's also not reasonable to assume that people bring their cars in for service every time the calibration becomes invalid - you'd have everybody bringing in their cars twice a month. An in-car solution is needed."

Eventually we'll have automation, rules, and enforcement to a point to where this is not an issue, but to start we'll probably need to include a 'human override' functionality so that humans can drive out of a situation where someone is intentionally stopping the car, whether it be a childish prank or a malicious robbery attempt. The catch to this is that some might just want to always drive themselves. To remedy this, the human override feature could be linked with an emergency system such that engaging human override places an emergency call similar to 911. So if someone needs to escape a robber or assailant, they can do so and contact police simultaneously, if someone is obstructing the road they can report it, and if someone abuses the override the penalty could be similar to a false 911 call.   This does create a logistical challenge because creating a brand new emergency system is not easy, but it's certainly possible and it might be more feasible due to a decrease in the need for patrols or insurance."

I'm not  convinced the car companies have the data science,  machine learning expertise to implement this tech in house,  so watch to see if companies build up these types of jobs. Otherwise they will partner or  license the tech from another company.  It will be a delicate balance for the car companies - most  don't want  to be the first to implement it, but none can afford to be the last"

Fullsize vehicles have space for both humans and luggage, and what with all SDCs being electric we can make them sleeker, MUCH lighter, and all the other things that are so great. After all, electric motors don't need gearing, don't need heavy engines, don't need fuel tanks full of 100+kg of fuel etc.  Pod SDCs are great if there's just one of you and only a little luggage, or just two people going to the shops. They can be small, light, cheap to make and cheap to run, and safe too what with extra space being available for new safety features to go into.  The point is, there's definitely room in the market for both. You don't have to have just one or the other.

Yeah that is probably too young,  but 10-12 would still probably be alright and pretty helpful.  Plus with integration of their phone with yours, ride requests could be denied.     Because you'd like to make sure they reached their destination?    Restricted account that only allows certain routes or real time authentication by the parent. If they were to young you wouldn't  be sending them to a place where an adult wasn't present.     Because you want to use the time to talk with them?    Yeah,  this is no different then now,  but SDC's will actually have an advantage overall.  Some examples:   you have a sudden late meeting and need to pick up your kids from school. I recall being forgotten at soccer practice when I was growing up. As a kid, I'd rather have the pick up then waiting in the rain.  There is an afternoon event. The SDC picks up your kids from school, and you're able to leave work early since you can join the meeting at work fully engaged (e.g.   search/view things on your computer). You get to their event on time.  I think the vehicles will actually have femto cell type devices installed eventually.  A large cluster of randomly distributed cell sites that can be easily upgraded.  We'll be rolling out 5g or 6g and bandwidth will be huge.  I could see real time super dooper high definition TM connections between two vehicles.  You could link with your kids vehicle and talk with them on your way to meeting them at some event or at home.  I think working while commuting  will be a huge thing, but will actually allow for more home time (dependent  on where jobs and work evolve)"

I don't want to get into some institutional pod taxi. People in this thread frequently talk as if a future SDC service is going to be immune from market forces and provide a car instantly and cheaply at the touch of a button on their phone, forgetting supply and demand issues and the profit incentive for any company that would operate SDCs.

Close to 90% of US households own at least one car, and presumably they have a place to park it at home and also when they go out. Unless you live in Manhattan or one of a few other very dense urban areas, parking isn't a huge issue. If enough people want to park in the future, parking will continue to be made available just like it is today.  In a dense urban environment where parking is limited, my self-driving car can drop me off and circle the block looking for a parking space for hours for all I care. No need to pick anyone else up.

Here is the list of levels from NHTSA, it looks like they're describing an autonomous car as level 3 and an SDC as level 4   No-Automation (Level 0): The driver is in complete and sole control of the primary vehicle controls – brake, steering, throttle, and motive power – at all times.  Function-specific Automation (Level 1): Automation at this level involves one or more specific control functions. Examples include electronic stability control or pre-charged brakes, where the vehicle automatically assists with braking to enable the driver to regain control of the vehicle or stop faster than possible by acting alone.  Combined Function Automation (Level 2): This level involves automation of at least two primary control functions designed to work in unison to relieve the driver of control of those functions. An example of combined functions enabling a Level 2 system is adaptive cruise control in combination with lane centering.  Limited Self-Driving Automation (Level 3): Vehicles at this level of automation enable the driver to cede full control of all safety-critical functions under certain traffic or environmental conditions and in those conditions to rely heavily on the vehicle to monitor for changes in those conditions requiring transition back to driver control. The driver is expected to be available for occasional control, but with sufficiently comfortable transition time. The Google car is an example of limited self-driving automation.  Full Self-Driving Automation (Level 4): The vehicle is designed to perform all safety-critical driving functions and monitor roadway conditions for an entire trip. Such a design anticipates that the driver will provide destination or navigation input, but is not expected to be available for control at any time during the trip. This includes both occupied and unoccupied vehicles."

SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,DriverlessAnonymous,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:35:53 2015 UTC,"I still think these ranks are limiting.  There are cars at places like airports that are lvl4 in that they need no driver and have no steering wheel. But they couldn't go on a normal road at all.  Going forward we'll have cars that are highway level 4s. Or everywhere but country road level 4s. Or non-winter 4s.  They really need to distinguish cars that can drive 100% of the time in 15% of situations (which is a great tool that could eat up a huge market). And a car that can drive 15% of the time in 100% of situations which is basically useless.  Compare a car that is level 4 when it isn't raining to a level 4 when in California. One can't be sold to the public, the other could garner millions of sales."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,Ambiwlans,15,Fri Jul 3 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"Their terminology seems totally backwards to me.  I'd have thought ""autonomous"" would be for cars that never need a human, and ""self-driving"" is for cars that can drive themselves but still have the human in control."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,robobreasts,3,Thu Jul 2 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems silly, they define autonomous vehicles as vehicles without autonomy."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,Tiak,2,Fri Jul 3 06:35:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting article. I don't think the ""premium brands’ cachet"" disappears though. Look at the differentiated uber services."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,turntOrange3592,4,Thu Jul 2 17:50:11 2015 UTC,"They are saying personal car ownership will drop significantly, but what about overall car sales?   The fleets of ""robotaxis"" they describe will still be owned by some company, and they'll likely be turning over those vehicles quickly; probably much faster than even traditional car rental agencies. Those cars will probably be putting on 500 or so miles a day; even with the gentler use of the software driver, most of those cars will need to be replaced every year or two.   Could car sales potentially increase? I think a lot of people, even now, will opt for an uber or taxi over public transit. If the price dropped even more (which I would assume it would), I think a lot of people would opt for a private ride, or uberpool/via model where you share the car with one or two others, and zero crazy/stinky/noisy people.  I don't know if that could overcome people leasing cars they never drive and the like, though, in terms of car sales."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,kerbuffel,4,Thu Jul 2 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"One thing you're not considering is that most cars don't hit their maximum lifespan. A fleet could get many hundreds of thousands of miles out of a car in a year or two. Privately owned, most cars never hit that number before eventually being junked. People are buying more ""potential miles"" than they're actually using. It's sort of like computer virtualization, where a small pool of servers can service a large number of users who would otherwise all buy their own desktop."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,mflood,2,Thu Jul 2 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Most privately owned cars, as well as rental car fleets, are probably resold on the used market.  I wonder what will happen with fully autonomous (self-driving) cars.  Google/Uber/whatever fleet operator won't want to be driving people around in dated, worn-out cars.  But on the other hand, what is the resale market going to be?"
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,qurun,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"But this problem is only exacerbated with public-use vehicles.  Taxis and even Uber cars are going to be much younger on average than the average vehicles on the road.  If a vehicle is going to carry passengers, it has a lot more pressure to run smoother, to have a more pristine interior, and to be as up-to-date as possible, so there is every reason for turn-around to actually increase, and for wasted miles to increase along with it."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,Tiak,4,Fri Jul 3 06:56:00 2015 UTC,"Most cars are only used perhaps 5% of the time- the rest of the time they are unused. A robotaxi uses that unutilised time picking up other users- reducing the number of cars needed overall.   Now of course it's not like I can just divide that 95% between others- I'm not taking 19 cars off the road because most of us need to get to the office for 9am. But let's say JohnnyCab gives a 30% fare discount for journeys before 8.30am. I'd consider it. And enough others would too to help smooth demand.  So no, it's not 19/20 cars off the road- but perhaps half?"
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,simonjp,0,Thu Jul 2 22:34:50 2015 UTC,"I think people probably opt for an Uber because they don't have the money to afford buying a car, even though they want it.  However, some cars aren't used 5% of the time - like the builders' vans/pick-ups and SUV's I see. One make-up artist even uses her Mazda 6 stationwagon as a mobile beauty salon, apparently, in my area."
SelfDrivingCars,3bv2yb,axc86,2,Fri Jul 3 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well, currently, perhaps. I think Uber is a taxi replacement rather than a car replacement. There are plenty of times when I'd prefer a taxi over a car.   I only want to go one way I'm drunk or drinking I don't know where I'm going There's limited parking where I'm going I don't fancy driving today I could really rather spend the time working on my TPS report/ playing a game / reading   ...put simply, yes, driving is fun. Sometimes. But other times it is just a chore and getting someone else to do it for you would be amazing if you could afford it.   What happens when it's actually the cheaper option?  And as for the 'workhorses' you mention, they will continue to be used as they are, and probably owned as they are. In much the same way, lorries are probably the first vehicle to be automated- lorry drivers are expensive, can only work for 4 hours at a stretch before needing a break, etc. They're also dangerous- the majority of cyclist deaths in London are in accidents with lorries.   AutoTrucks will be one of the first self-drivers we see, I suspect."

Here are several reasons:    Better Land Use: Cities and Universities allocate massive amounts of their best real estate for parking, and large parking lots create huge issues for cities.  Water mitigation:Additionally, when it rains, the velocity of runoff from large parking lots requires drainage resources that simply wouldn't be required if that space were used differently.  Frees up income: SDCs have the potential to bring thousands of dollars per household in annual disposable income to cities as people ditch a second car for SDC fleets. A lot of this money will be spent locally.   Counties will lose money due to decreased fines but those should be offset by decreased demand for public services."

As cheap as transport could become, it's not going to be cheap enough that an advertising will foot the bill of a ride just for you watching their ads. There's simply not enough people with money to publish ads that would cover the cost of all of the travelling people want to do, anyway, as well as the cost disparity making it unworkable.  Plus, the idea that Google makes all of their money from ads is long out of date, they have plenty of products and services now where this isn't the case at all.

Ignoring that 10% is a huge amount of revenue for Google, you can see where the trend it going... yet I'm speaking from experience of having paid Google for non-advertising related services for years, the point is that it's not something upcoming in the future when they roll out SDCs, it's something they already do.  Obviously the ad portion is gonna be huge cos that's traditionally what they've done and is still a huge part of their business. But the way people are arguing this is like ""they are Google therefore it's going to be ad-supported"" is just a dumb argument, is all I'm saying."
SelfDrivingCars,3bpdr3,CallMeOatmeal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:41:00 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I agree. There's no way it will be fully ad-supported. But I think it's very likely they will be ad-subsidized to lower the cost of the rides, or other business models that include an element of advertising. But fully ad-subsidized, the math just won't work, running a physical fleet of vehicles is a lot more expensive per person than it is to run the servers for a fully ad-subsidized service like Gmail."
SelfDrivingCars,3bpdr3,CallMeOatmeal,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"One way I could see them going is to cut deals with businesses that customers want to travel to. Say I want to go to the mall to buy some new clothes. Google could cut some kind of deal with Macy's and if the customer buys a $50 gift certificate and it is used on the same day, the ride is free (subsidized by Macy's, or by both parties, depending on the terms of the deal). I'm betting there will be lots of interesting business models, but I do agree that there will never be a 100% ad-supported platform. Ads will definitely be used though to drive down the cost of the rides."

At the checkout register, you can get your ride(s) validated.    I guess the problem is that SDC rides are considerably more expensive than parking, and the cost is incremental (per ride) rather than fixed (one more car parked in the garage doesn't really cost the mall any more)."

SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,Shorvok,5,Mon Jun 29 22:01:15 2015 UTC,The bid Uber put up for HERE was really low. Nokia paid many times that for NAVTEQ and HERE has become a more valuable company since then.  It was really a stretch even within the company for us to believe that Nokia would sell HERE so low. Would be a bit silly to sell a company you paid $8 billion for for only $3 billion.

And in the future they'll need advanced mapping capabilities to develop their own autonomous vehicles. The previous rumour suggested that Uber has partnered with Baidu to bid for Nokia's mapping division HERE (among several other bidders, including a consortium of automakers and Facebook). Now it's not clear if Nokia is even interested in selling, I don't think they realized how valuable it was before the bidding war started.  Uber right now kind of has to develop their own autonomous vehicles as a matter of survival. At the moment Uber appears to be throwing more money at the problem than anybody, and I guess we'll see whether or not that translates into results."

SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,Mr_Munchausen,-3,Tue Jun 30 05:07:37 2015 UTC,Microsoft isn't even relevant anymore. Google took their place a long time ago.
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,sweetmoses,6,Tue Jun 30 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"Here is a list of the world's most valuable brands. #1:Apple, #2:Microsoft, #3:Google ..."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,Mr_Munchausen,0,Tue Jun 30 13:21:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I know Microsoft makes a lot of money. Most people still have their operating systems on their computers. But they're not looked at as a technology leader, or even a company that has consumers anticipating its products.   Whether or not they make a car won't affect technology much one way or the other. People are looking to Google, Apple, Tesla, and even newcomers like Uber to develop the technology for the future. Not Microsoft.   They're diversified enough to stay alive for a while. And I'm sure they'll find a way to get their piece, but they're not relevant in terms of what will happen in the SDC market. Whether or not Microsoft makes a vehicle only matters to them and their shareholders, not the new auto industry."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,sweetmoses,3,Tue Jun 30 15:59:50 2015 UTC,"MS is certainly a technology leader as they're the #2 tech company in the world.   If they were to make a car it could affect technology as much as any other company.   Regular people have anticipated Microsoft technology, such as X-Box One and Windows 10.  Being a system administrator, I'm anticipating the latest update to SCCM.   You're right Microsoft isn't relevant, because I haven't heard of them working with SDCs, yet. If Microsoft was in the SDC market their tech would be relevant if it was successful, not because of how popular you perceive them to be.   I'm sure someday Google may displace them from their #2 spot, however MS won't be going away any time soon."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,Mr_Munchausen,-2,Tue Jun 30 17:31:44 2015 UTC,"Most sys admins and engineers like Microsoft because they make the tools that they work with. But whether or not you realize it, nobody in the consumer world even knew Windows 10 was coming out. I mean they all hoped Microsoft would do something to fix their string of horrible OS releases, but it's not like the world was clamoring for some new Windows feature. They just hoped for something that was more stable than everything after XP.   So they're still big because they are in most cheap computers, and the average consumer doesn't use a computer enough to get anything but a cheap computer.   Nobody buys their tablets and phones, which suggests that they will have a hard time convincing future consumers to purchase their products over their more prestigious competitors. Apple is on one side beating them on quality and cool factor and Google is on the other side beating them on price and access to their powerful search engine. MS really has no competitive share in any market besides desktop OS, and that market is shrinking.   They have huge brand recognition, but can't sell mobile devices! How do you expect to sell cars if you can't even sell phones? If MS does make a car they'll be about as relevant as Hardees is in the fast food market."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,sweetmoses,3,Tue Jun 30 18:27:45 2015 UTC,It sounds like you just dont like MS which is fine. MS is still number 2 for a reason.

SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,sweetmoses,3,Wed Jul 1 17:54:22 2015 UTC,"Speaking of someone intimately familiar with Microsoft's research, you have no clue what you are talking about. MS is pumping out some of the best tools and research around."

That's huge in actual numbers and profit, but it's nothing in terms of tech culture. They're 92% of the desktop market, but that's the only one of the markets I mentioned that's shrinking. But hey, there's nothing wrong with being mediocre."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,sweetmoses,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"One, I don't work for Microsoft. I have worked closely with them and used some of their findings in my research. I currently go to a top 3 CS School and see the type of influence Microsoft has had on the state-of-the-art. I'd like to see what has shaped your perception of how ""tech culture"" views Microsoft, because it most likely does not actually represent the views that people actually working on cutting edge technology have.  Second, you are talking consumer products. I am talking R&D. The sheer amount of quality work in the fields of computer vision, AI/machine learning, robotics, quantum computing, etc. is astounding. Practically every conference I go to has half a dozen papers from Microsoft.  Microsoft is and will be hugely relevant to any cutting edge technology developments for some time. If you think the only thing Microsoft does is make operating systems, you are sorely mistaken."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,pyrojoe121,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:42:11 2015 UTC,"I am talking about consumer products, which is something that Microsoft hasn't shown much promise with lately. The two biggest hardware markets recently have been mobile phones and tablets (and arguably smart watches). Where is Microsoft with any of those categories? I'm sure the Surface is a money maker for them, but it's not at all on the cutting edge.   So while you have some insight on their R&D, I don't think the average electronics consumer has much faith in them successfully bringing an intriguing product to market. MS is first and foremost a software company, but software isn't worth what it once was. And now we're talking about automated vehicles. I'm sure they'll find a way to license their software in some cars, but I doubt they'll make any traction with an actual vehicle.   I could be wrong of course. But I seriously can't think of the last MS product that I even considered buying. And I can't name anything that they make that another company can't make better. They're in a lot of markets, but they're only relevant in operating systems."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk6gv,tanjoodo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"You said Microsoft isn't relevant anymore with respect to SDCs. That is a false statement. They have massive amounts of computer vision and machine learning experience that any company would die to have.  Microsoft would not make an SDC to market, but they have made technologies that make SDCs possible. That is why they are relevant. Consumer products play no part at all. Though if you have had much experience with robotics you'd know that the Kinect is used absolutely everywhere on indoor robotics.  And you are also ignoring the effect they have on straight up programming. C# and F# are really nice languages that are just starting to get some traction in heavily Linux based research fields because they just open sources .NET core."

SelfDrivingCars,3bk2nj,diythrow24234,6,Mon Jun 29 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"I think the first major check point is CA DMV writing the driverless rules.  They were supposed to be out Jan 1, 2015 but have been delayed.  Then reports were that they would be released in May with public hearings this summer.  That date has come and gone.  These rules very well could be the rules other states use, or even the FEDs use. BTW, Google will be releasing monthly reports on their cars from now on.  Edit: another check point is when Google starts operating their vehicles driverlessly."
SelfDrivingCars,3bk2nj,walky22talky,2,Mon Jun 29 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"I think the first thing we'll see is an uptake in semi-autonomous modes. We already have this to a limited extent, vehicles that can do automatic lane keeping and adaptive cruise control can drive on highways with very little human input, and some can even do automatic overtakes with human 'permission'. So I think we'll first this kind of technology will have to make its way down to the 'everyman' cars instead of being exclusive to premium vehicles.  From there it will likely be a very slow and steady migration rather than suddenly seeing 100% autonomous vehicles in large numbers. The semi-autonomous modes will start to cover more and more situations. Today highways, tomorrow the suburbs.   Over time the existing modes would become more refined and fleshed out and featured. Highway driving would be able to perform overtakes without human input, perform lane changes as necessary for navigation where highways split and merge together, only requiring the driver to enter and exit the highway. Around that point we'll likely start to see lighter suburban driving, which requires the vehicles to understand speed limits and signs for things like schools where the rules may change depending on the time of day.  So before we see full SDCs, I think we'll have to make a lot of stepping stones over 'driver assist' vehicles that do some of the work while the world (especially the legal world) starts to adjust slowly to having cars doing some of the work themselves, before doing all of it."

SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,KimboBear,8,Mon Jun 29 16:20:37 2015 UTC,"Only when autonomous cars are the only thing on the road, probably. As it is, they should travel around the same speed as other cars on the road.   But theoretically they could travel at higher speeds, only limited by how slow they need to go to be able to avoid accidents."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,atsu333,3,Mon Jun 29 16:40:06 2015 UTC,"I think for the foreseeable future there will be a need for speed limits - as long as there are human drivers on the road, they'll be introducing larger amounts of uncertainty into what SDCs can navigate around, and humans will have panic reactions if SDCs are shooting past them or in front of them.  Once people give up on trying to drive themselves, speeds will be limited more by other factors than some arbitrary number: fuel efficiency, road conditions, weather conditions, vehicle conditions (if the car is 100 miles from a service area when it notices a problem developing with a tire, it would be silly to proceed as if it were at 100% until it gets to a service facility), probability of obstacles jumping out in front of them, presence/absence of smart intersections/roads, and the capability of the individual cars' sensors.  After all, I expect that third-gen SDCs will have better awareness of their surroundings than first or second-gen ones will."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,chilehead,2,Mon Jun 29 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Relevant Brad Templeton piece on SDCs and speed limits.  tl;dr    As with its ancestor, the cruise control, the operator of a robocar can set the car to operate at any speed within its general limits, regardless of the road speed limit. The moral and safety decisions rest with this person.   ... and ...   Once robocars can be certified safe, they may well be able to drive even faster than humans can safely drive. While this is not energy efficient, in many ways it might make sense to let them go even faster than humans are allowed to go. This could either be done autobahn style, where the left lane has no speed limit and slower cars must pull to the right, or it could involve managed lanes that are limited to high speed robocars at certain times of the day. This would strongly encourage a switch to robocars."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,DriverlessAnonymous,2,Mon Jun 29 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Even though autonomous cars drastically reduce accident rates in the coming 10-20 years, there will still be accidents. Aside from speed limits helping with fuel economy (somewhat less relevant on more modern all-electric vehicles), speed limits help to reduce the total damage done when there is the occasional car accident.   Another thing to consider is that autonomous cars can only compute everything going on in their surroundings as fast as their computers can work. Let's say, for example, that a self driving car operates its vision system with a refresh rate of 250 milliseconds - 4 times per second. Without a speed limit, this vehicle might be able to travel at 100 mph. At this speed, the vehicle would travel about 36 feet in between refreshing its view of its surroundings. This is obviously massively unsafe, as tons of things can change in your surroundings if you're 36 feet away from where you were last time you looked around. Obviously computers will be faster in the future, and SDC won't be operating at 4 Hz, but you get the idea.  Another point is stopping distance. Traveling at 100 mph, it would take 82 feet to stop, which is also obviously very unsafe in case anything got out in front of the vehicle anywhere less than 82 feet ahead. Even if an autonomous car could react perfectly, there's physics at work that just don't allow you to safely travel at those kinds of speeds.  Because of these factors and more, IMO speed limits might be increased somewhat in the relatively far future, but in general, they're here to stay."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,Zakalwen,2,Tue Jun 30 07:44:52 2015 UTC,"On roads that are restricted to SDVs with no chance of pedestrians (e.g. motorways) then I don't see why an autobahn approach won't be adopted. Simply tell your car to go as far as possible within your fuel budget. With current technology cars can estimate their miles per gallon at various speeds so it's not that hard to believe.  In all other circumstances speed limits make sense because they protect pedestrians. SDVs might be good but they wont be perfect, there are going to be the odd accidents. It's much easier to slow down and stop in time when travelling at 20/30 than it is at 40/50."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,PrototypeNM1,3,Sun Jul 5 21:40:54 2015 UTC,"Speed limits aren't just there for safety; they are also there to limit fuel usage. Historically during oil shortages the national speed limit has been as low as 55mph.  I can't account for how this changes with electric vehicles where the energy source is better abstracted from the vehicle functioning, but I would hazard a guess that wear and tear becomes an issue at some point."
SelfDrivingCars,3bivm5,Sidewinder77,4,Mon Jun 29 16:48:16 2015 UTC,Groups of self-driving cars could theoretically still maintain safe braking distance by travelling 10cm apart on the highway.

The problem with this is that the speed limit had been 55 for more than 2 decades before the study was done. Because of that, the cars were designed to be most efficient at 55. The mechanics of the car can be altered to reach maximum performance at different speeds based on gear ratios. Whether you want better performance under or over 55 mph is irrelevant."

At an average trip length of 3-4 miles, you'd be looking at something in the $1 to $1.50 range.   If you dig into the details, the reduction is cost is driven by vehicle specialization. That is to say most urban trips are less than 4 miles and have <2 people in the car. For these trips small electric vehicles traveling at under 30mph will do. Since these vehicles are far less expensive to build ($10k or so) and maintain, the cost per mile assuming 60% utilization and a 3 year life span can get to $0.15.   On a ""sedan sized"" vehicle that could go highway speeds, you are looking at 2.5x that - $0.40 or so.

Also note that there are a number of potential issues with the Columbia study as far as using it to gauge actual prices--it assumes a fully autonomous, electric, $9,000 vehicle for starters. That is not likely to happen any time soon. It also completely excludes profit and other costs, which can make a huge difference.

SelfDrivingCars,3bi4mf,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,2,Mon Jun 29 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"That study used AAA's estimate for the total cost for car ownership. The lower cost is obtained from the fact that a person using a car sharing service can have the car they use more closely match the trip they are taking. For example if someone simply needs a car to commute to work there is no need for them to ride in a big SUV. Special built much smaller 2-seater commuter cars is how they get the price down and for a car subscription service to use them would be extremely likely.  Also note that there will be significant competition for a self driving car service. First off, mass transit will also have access to the technology. We'd likely see smaller automated busses appear that would offer an increased coverage area and frequency. Second there would be multiple car services servicing an area  just like right now we are seeing multiple car services like Lyft and Uber. Finally more car sharing services like Uber would pop up if the costs for the services were too high. People already use their own cars for such a service. Imagine how many more would if they didn't have to drive. People would offer up their cars to earn extra money for little to no effort when they didn't need them."
SelfDrivingCars,3bi4mf,SplitReality,0,Mon Jun 29 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"They factored in a great many savings. Notably much smaller, cheaper cars, and electric vehicles. Then they compared it against owning a large, internal combustion engine vehicle which is just an odd comparison. If electric vehicles become as inexpensive and cost saving as they predict they will be not many people would choose to buy a gas vehicle.   The vehicle size issue is a bit more difficult to predict. People choose vehicles far larger and more expensive than they need all the time now for various reasons. I'm not at all convinced people will suddenly be convinced to do the bulk of their trips in a glorified golf cart no matter how much economic sense it might make. Even if people do go for that, they still have the option of buying their own two seated vehicle for daily use, and if they need a bigger vehicle they still have that available to rent, the same as somebody who uses a car service for all their vehicle needs.    Also note that there will be significant competition for a self driving car service.   In the same way we have a lot of competition for broadband or cable? I see nothing that guarantees there will be significant competition. It will require huge investments of capitol, and larger fleets will lend themselves to better response times (favorable to the customer) and lower operating costs. I would certainly hope we'll see at least some competition, but I would be quite pleasantly surprised to see ""significant"" competition.    People would offer up their cars to earn extra money for little to no effort when they didn't need them.   The only way I can see this being economically viable is if large fleet services are overcharging, and there is a large service that allows people to pool their personally owned cars together (and that requires large numbers of people still owning private cars), otherwise empty mile charges will make them too expensive, and they're going to be less desirable anyway because quality control will be less.

Then they compared it against owning a large, internal combustion engine vehicle which is just an odd comparison. If electric vehicles become as inexpensive and cost saving as they predict they will be not many people would choose to buy a gas vehicle.   One of the main drawbacks to electric vehicles is their reduced driving range. That shortcoming becomes a non-factor if you are using a taxi service since it then become the taxi service's responsibility to keep the cars charged. If a car gets low on charge then it is simply told to go somewhere and plug in. However a person owning an electric car is restricted to using just that car so it becomes extremely inconvenienced if that car runs out of a charge. It is for this reason that the rise of the electric car's use will greater benefit an automated taxi service over straight up car ownership.  Also note that electric car technology will continue to improve which will greatly benefit the quicker turnover of cars for a car service vs. that of car ownership. A three year old electric car might seem as dated as a three year old computer.   The vehicle size issue is a bit more difficult to predict.

For a vehicle owner, people have to buy the largest vehicle that will fit all of their needs. If you have kids you'll get a vehicle large enough to transport the entire family even though the vast majority of trips don't need that capacity. There are plenty of people I know that commute to work in SUVs for exactly this reason.  Why would anybody care about the number of unused seats in the car they are using? They would only care about the seats that they are using. In that respect a 2-seater vehicle would be no different than a 4+-seater for the single person commuting to work. This would be even more apparent when the car is self driving. In this case the car ceases to be an extension of the driver and simply becomes the thing they are riding in. They'd care far more about the comfort of the seat, audio/video system, internet connection and so on than how big the car is.   In the same way we have a lot of competition for broadband or cable?

I would certainly hope we'll see at least some competition, but I would be quite pleasantly surprised to see ""significant"" competition.   No, in the same way we are currently getting competition for taxi services. Uber and Lyft are already undercutting taxi service. That is the apple-to-apples comparison. If as you say an automated taxi service did charge too much then more people would then choose to own their own automated car and that would provide a pool a readily available cars for another Uber like service. That would eliminate the need for a taxi company to have a large upfront capital cost. After all, that business model has already worked for Uber and Lyft.   The only way I can see this being economically viable is if large fleet services are overcharging, and there is a large service that allows people to pool their personally owned cars together (and that requires large numbers of people still owning private cars), otherwise empty mile charges will make them too expensive, and they're going to be less desirable anyway because quality control will be less. I think it's one of those things that seems possible but in reality won't work out that well.   That is exactly my point. An automated taxi service can't overcharge because if they did, competition from another service would undercut them. The Uber business model has shown that a taxi service monopoly can no longer be milked to inflate fares because if that does happen, private owners will pool their cars to provide an alternate.  You are also forgetting the competition from mass transit that I mentioned. They too will benefit from automated vehicles resulting in reduced costs and better service. For example I can easily see a fleet of smaller busses dynamically altering their routes based on travel requests made by mobile apps or at buss stops. That'd result in much closer pickup/dropoff locations and fewer intermediate stops along the way. It'd still be mass transit but would be much better than current service which would entice more users."

The entire point of testing is to find what they can't do well and gradually improve it, and there will be fewer and fewer such things going forward.   What's important is that the cars will be much safer than human drivers by the time they're released. Because, if they're not, they won't be released in the first place.

SelfDrivingCars,3bd0el,Universe_Man,5,Sun Jun 28 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"If this is the intersection I think it is, then it's confusing, and the computer didn't do any worse than typical humans do there. There is a gradual turn to the right with an intersection midway through, so cars need to stop and go before the turn is completed.  Sometimes people get confused because the straight path becomes a different road, while you need to veer right to stay on El Monte. Even the Google Map I linked to above says both forks are El Monte, which is wrong. In that confused state, people sometimes blow right through the stop sign at the Jay Street intersection."

To me it doesn't need a signal as the car can only go one direction, straight.  It can't turn left or right once it hits that stop sign.  Maybe Google view it as a right turn and not straight."

SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,axc86,11,Sat Jun 27 11:21:15 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting question.  In my experience, having two person rigs are kind of a necessity for proper patient care.  There aren't really ""Ambulence Drivers""  usually it's an EMT and a Paramedic. Or sometimes two Paramedics.     At least in the areas worked in, unless a third rider is aquired on scene (a fireman), if a patient is coding (needs CPR), the rig will stop and the two first responders will work together to try to stabilize a patient while waiting for an assist.    Having a self driving rig might be helpful in that situation, but I do wonder the utility of that.  (It's a macabre reality that patients who require CPR outside the hospital have a fairly poor survival rate)"
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,obnoxiouscarbuncle,3,Sat Jun 27 13:09:28 2015 UTC,"100 percent agreed. I have a lot of family in ems and this is the general setup. In nonemergency transport situations (like dialysis transports and the like) you can get by with a driver and an emt but otherwise they pair emt and medic. There is no way to lift people alone safely the way EMS workers have to. Since there need to be at least two people anyway, there will likely always be drivers with ambulances."
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,muhaku2,4,Sat Jun 27 17:51:21 2015 UTC,At least self driving cars would be better at pulling over when an ambulance is coming.

SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,muhaku2,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:10:17 2015 UTC,"Eventually, when all the traffic around an ambulance is self-driving, they won't need to pull over. They'll simply get out of the way a few moments before they need to, opening a moving hole in already swift-moving traffic to allow an ambulance through at high speed. I can see where the ambulance of the future will be equipped with softer tires (with a higher speed rating) and better brakes than the average SDC to support higher roadway speeds than they currently deal with.  Perhaps there will be a federally mandated wireless protocol to allow emergency vehicles to access traffic data from cars around it so that it they can essentially see farther ahead than other SDCs.  The purpose of pulling over, after all, is to be predictable and safe.. things the SDCs can do while moving."
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,Calamity_Jesus,2,Sun Jun 28 01:23:16 2015 UTC,(It's a macabre reality that patients who require CPR outside the hospital have a fairly poor survival rate)   Couldn't this be simply because if they require CPR outside of the hospital you have to stop going to the hospital to perform CPR? Doesn't the hospital have more/better equipment to deal with any situation where you'd need CPR?
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,f0urtyfive,2,Sat Jun 27 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"It sounds like something worth investigating.    Getting reliable data on CPR effectiveness is difficult.  Off the top of my head, 9/10 patients requiring CPR outside of a medical facility don't survive to be discharged from a hospital, and around 8/10 who code within a hospital don't survive.    Again, off the top of my head, I believe this discrepancy was attributed to both the availability of resuscitation tech (defibrillators, ventilators, etc.), trained personnel, and the immediacy of someone beginning CPR."
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,obnoxiouscarbuncle,9,Sat Jun 27 20:16:32 2015 UTC,Emergency services will probably be one of the last things to get self driving technology.   Too much judgment is involved in them. Feature recognition as it is has a hard time picking out cars in other lanes and road signs. We're a very long way from it judging how many cars are at an intersection and if it's safe to go through the red light.
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,Shorvok,8,Sat Jun 27 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to create a set of rules that determine when it's OK to drive on the wrong side of the road when there's a traffic island, when it's OK to mount the pavement, when it's OK to use the wrong lane at the junction, and when it's too unpredictable for any of those things to be safe. Also, a lot relies on non-verbal communication with the surrounding drivers, and that's not something a computer's good at, particularly with no face."
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,cubist_castle,3,Sat Jun 27 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"Making rules that define how to break driving rules is a far more complicated proposition that a normal self-driving car, and that's already really complicated.

Some seriously advanced AI would be needed."

SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,DoctorSteve,2,Sat Jun 27 13:56:19 2015 UTC,I doubt it will happen until we have true general AI. There's just no sensible budget argument for it - ambulance drivers don't make up a huge cost center.
SelfDrivingCars,3bani9,ZorbaTHut,2,Sun Jun 28 00:24:16 2015 UTC,"I work in the self-driving car industry. /u/cubist_castle and /u/Shorvok hit the nail on the head. It's going to be a very long time before you see a driverless ambulance, or any other emergency vehicle. I'd guess easily many decades at the minimum, and more likely never.  The thing to realize is that in the relatively near term future, driverless vehicles from a variety of companies will probably do OK in scenarios where there's nothing terribly unusual going on. Emergency vehicles like ambulances, however, deal with nothing but unusual scenarios. Running street lights, mounting curbs, running stop signs, driving down the wrong side of the road, swerving rapidly, breaking the speed limit, taking turns tighter than is comfortable etc, all happen in a normal day's work. These maneuvers are nightmare scenarios for self driving cars to handle. Humans have the very unique ability to make judgement calls about which rules are OK to break, and when, which is something that robots will have a very hard time with.  TL;DR: Ambulances will stay human driven for a long, long time."

SelfDrivingCars,3b9ns1,PaulGodsmark,8,Sat Jun 27 03:02:24 2015 UTC,"How's this for disruptive? I can see a point where SDCs are so accident free that manufacturers will offer free insurance with the purchase of your car.  If you think about a car that basically can't cause an accident unless there is a manufacture's mistake, which they may have to pay for anyway then the only room left for insurance would be ""other"" things like trees falling on cars, other uninsured drivers, and theft.  The nature of a SDC is that it will be festooned with sensors and cameras so it will not be a he-said-she-said situation after an accident. Also this level of technology will probably reduce theft.  I could foresee a situation where fairly large numbers of days would go by without a single payout for an at-fault accident. This not only would mean that the payouts are small but the administrative overheads would also be much smaller.  They wouldn't be zero as bad things do happen to good cars but I could see where the car company would have an interesting advantage when it came to making things right. They could say, come on in an we will fix up/replace your car in-house. Again at a cost far lower than an insurance company.  Obviously this is somewhat ignoring that SDCs will probably lead to far greater levels of some kind of fleet ownership such as taxis, rentals, or fleet services."
SelfDrivingCars,3b9ns1,LessonStudio,3,Sat Jun 27 05:08:13 2015 UTC,"Edit. I misread your first sentence. I thought you said ""how is this disruptive"". My fault. You are right  I'm thinking you don't understand the meaning of the word 'disruptive' in a business sense. It means that this is going to disrupt the insurance industry and that they are going to have to completely change he way they do things in order to stay relevant. And this will likely hit them pretty hard."
SelfDrivingCars,3b9ns1,theneedfull,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:23:54 2015 UTC,"There is a business term that I am looking for where a business is presented with a sea change that so alters their business that it becomes clear that they will have to hack off some limbs to survive. But they simply refuse and then they either die or become a shadow of their former selves.  For instance I had an argument around 1998 with a senior Sun employee that the web company I worked for was dumping our Sun machines (roughly $20,000 a pop) for piles of Linux machines ($2,000) a pop. I said that we were getting 10 nearly as powerful machines for his one and that they were very reliable and since they were commodity machines we could get more within an hour from over a dozen stores in the city.   He simply told me that we were making a mistake and that we would be back.   That said, I am shocked every day that the DB company that starts with O is still around and thriving, with the plethora of excellent free databases that are available.   I could still make a list of companies that were faced with sudden changes after years of fat growth only to try changing when it was way too late. Compaq would be another great example.  So I suspect the insurance industry is staring down the barrel of SDCs and thinking, ""Won't happen to us."""
SelfDrivingCars,3b9ns1,LessonStudio,2,Sun Jun 28 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Given that scenario, collision would fall under product liability coverage, as would BI/PD liability.  That leaves comprehensive, which covers trees falling on the car, etc.  In states with reasonable insurance markets (excluding e.g., NC, NJ, MI) your scenario makes a great deal of sense.  Comp is not a significant factor in the cost of insurance, and it wouldn't be expensive as a standalone product.  Given that's the only thing the driver has to insure, that's potentially quite reasonable.  Assuming decent coverage (it would have to be, since people finance vehicles), I'd buy from the company offering insurance over the one that's not, all other things being equal.  NC I'm excluding because Goodwin has taken an already unsustainable system and further broken it in the interest of driving down rates to an artificially low level.  NJ I'm excluding because they have a partial no-fault system.  MI I'm excluding because they have a full no-fault system.  I'm not sure manufacturers would pay for PIP, and I'm quite sure they wouldn't pay for full no-fault.  Exclude FL, for the same reasons.  But in the majority of states, that makes a great deal of sense.  Financing commercials already say ""residency restrictions apply,"" so excluding residents of no-fault states from that promotion wouldn't be a big deal."

I'm personally not a massive SDC fan, and wont be running out to buy one any time soon. But none of these are reasons not to be excited by them.   OK, so learning to recognise the officer could be an issue. One that could be fixed in many many ways. But you're assuming the car will cause an accident the other side of the officer telling it to slow down. Officers have to warn people about upcoming dangers because people become complacent and stop looking for danger. Large dual carriageway road, human drivers expect everything in front of them to be travelling. A car accident isn't travelling, so people need to be reminded to keep their eyes on the road and react. The SDC will always be watching, it'll always be alert and it wont become complacent. There will be less need to warn it in advance. Yeah, OK. Though, this article assumes that a human who cannot see the road will also stay in their lane in snowy conditions... from experience, that's not always the case. The article assumes that people will always react well to wet/icy conditions. Again, that's not always the case. And in reality, people are already relying on the advances in computer controls to hold the car in a straight line in these conditions. In an SDC the computer isn't trying to interprete human input. A fatal rear ending collision... really? WTF? Everywhere I've ever driven, if you rear end someone, that's your fault. The SDC has no choice but to slow down as much as possible, and any programmer would be silly to think otherwise. See an obstruction ahead, hammer the brakes. You don't cause a rear end collision by braking. You cause a rear end collision by tailgating the car in front. A car performs as near to a perfect emergency stop as possible. From 30mph (assuming the UK) and didn't stop in time to not hit the kid. So using the UK governemnts car stop distance guideline which we all know is super conservative on how quick a car can stop. And leaving in the ""reaction time"", that kid jumped out within the 23m in front of a car which is travelling towards the kid. And you're really asking who is to blame? You think that's even a legal question. If I were driving as a human and did the same, I wouldn't be looking at facing legal blame unless there were evidence of something else having happened. Like speeding, or DUI.  See (3). Sudden stops do not cause rear end collisions. Tailgating the car in front causes collisions. Don't tailgate. Right..."

SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,raddits,2,Fri Jun 26 11:29:15 2015 UTC,"On number two, don't be all ""well humans aren't perfect drivers either, so, you know, it just all evens out."" SDCs right now are pretty much incapable of driving in snow and rain. It's not a fair comparison right now.  On #3, you're missing the point.    See an obstruction ahead, hammer the brakes.   So while on the freeway, I should hammer the brakes if a plastic bag blows in front of me, even as a tractor trailer is tailgating me? That's insane, regardless of who's tailgating whom. The point the authors were trying to make is that you must balance the danger of hitting the obstruction and the danger of a possible rear-end collision. This is not so straight forward when you consider the obstruction could be human, animal, or different types of debris. I'm guessing you'll respond that humans don't do this right now, but I assure you many of us are making judgement calls like this all the time."

SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,withabeard,2,Fri Jun 26 20:54:25 2015 UTC,"The only evidence I've seen is from the February 2015 crash they reported. The Google car got hit on from the side on the rear-panel. From the report, it seems as if the Google car might have avoided the collision of the autonomous system hadn't started braking in response to a anticipated collision. It's as if the car's only response to a near-collision is to apply the brakes.  But, you know, this is all from a one-paragraph description of a crash. It's not evidence for much.   A Google Lexus model AV was travelling northbound on El Camino Real in autonomous mode when another vehicle travelling westbound on View Street failed to come to a stop at the stop sign at the intersection of El Camino and View Street. The other vehicle rolled through the stop sign and struck the right rear quarter panel and right rear wheel of the Google AV. Prior to the collision, the Google AV’s autonomous technology began applying the brakes in response to its detection of the other vehicle’s speed and trajectory. Just before the collision, the driver of the Google AV disengaged autonomous mode and took manual control of the vehicle in response to the application of the brakes by the Google AV’s autonomous technology. The Google AV was in manual mode. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage."

SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,withabeard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:57:47 2015 UTC,Got some evidence for that? That they have been rear ended statistically more than any other vehicle? Rear ending shouldn't be fixed by driving through hazards anyway. It should be fixed by not tailgating.
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,withabeard,2,Sat Jun 27 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"Rear ending shouldn't be fixed by driving through hazards anyway   I agree, but right now the Google car is extremely conservative, and considers hazardous situations that few human drivers would."
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,BeriAlpha,2,Sat Jun 27 01:23:13 2015 UTC,"You got me thinking on (1).  NHTSA says 24 million vehicles were involved in property damage crashes in 2010, including both police-reported and non-reported. Roughly 30% of those were rear-end collisions, so 7.2 million vehicles involved. Some of these crashes include more than two vehicles. To be conservative, I'll assume 2.5 vehicles per crash, so 2.9 million crashes in which 4.4 million were rear-ended. Americans drive 3 trillion miles per year, so a typical American gets rear-ended on average once every 680,000 miles.   Google has driven 1 million miles in autonomous mode, and was rear-ended 4 times in autonomous mode as of May. So on average, Google's car is getting rear-ended once every 250,000 miles while in autonomous mode.   Without checking, I'm pretty sure this is not a significant difference because of the low sample size and the fact that Google's driving is not representative of the general public. For starters, they don't seem to be on Interstates much these days, which are generally safer per mile. Second, their vehicles look weird, which may be distracting drivers and causing some of these crashes.  Feel free to call out errors in my analysis. I did this kind of quick, and NHTSA's stuff is hard to interpret sometimes.  edit: revised my vehicle per crash assumption"
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,fib16,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:54:46 2015 UTC,"I guess my point isn't that it's comparable. But the author said they wont work because they can't handle it. Humans really aren't much better than SDCs right now. We can't just say SDCs wont work because of something that humans can't yet get right.  At this stage we're speculating. I/you/we don't know what the SDCs are currently programmed to stop for.  Invent a crazy scenario I've not yet agreed with and then call me insane... cheers.  Would I suggest hammering the brakes for a plastic bag? Not at all. As the author posed, would I suggest hammering the brakes for a child in the road? Absolutely. Even if there is a semi tailgating you.  And again, you use something I didn't say to make me out to be stupid. Cheers dude, good on ya.  I'd certainly say that most humans are pretty poor at this right now. And humans generally will hammer the brakes at the smallest obstruction. Just last week I was nearly taken off my motorbike because the car in front braked for a plastic bag. But one scenario either way doesn't prove a point.  Ultimately any accident that involves a rear end collision is mostly attributable to the person coming from behind. The person in front has to react to the road in front of them first and foremost."
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,BeriAlpha,2,Fri Jun 26 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that as a personal attack, I was just trying to emphasize how the ""simple"" solutions that everyone's throwing out for these problems can be quite complex once you dive into the specifics. The rule about stopping for an obstruction is one I see a lot, and it just gets really hard to specify what to stop for and why.   And that's just one case, which can get even trickier in general collision avoidance.   Like using your example again, would you brake for another vehicle with a semi-behind you? Would you brake for a person that was jay-walking? How much risk are you willing to take on to protect someone who's braking the law?   It's a weird discussion, but at some point you may have a deep disagreement with SDC designers over the right course of action. This is a challenge, albeit not a deal-breaker for SDCs given the potential overall safety benefits, but a challenge nonetheless."

It's not a fair comparison.  3 - You're correct that the trolley problem example has probably caused more harm than good. The real issue is about balancing the risk among different road users, in this case the person in front of the SDC, the SDC's passengers, and the person behind the SDC. By focusing on the trolley problem, we're saying that these decisions only matter in a fatal accident, when in fact they come into play in all types of driving."
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,michelevit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the snow and rain problem makes people think the technology won't happen. When cell phone were first introduced, did people worry about spotty coverage? Yes, but that didn't stop the rollout of that technology. We adapted and perfected the tech. Today cell phones are everywhere. Same will be true with these self driving cars. I live where it never snows and seldom rains. Google will solve the rain and snow problem."
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,Dustin_00,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"Probably because no one's claiming that precipitation means SDCs are impossible. Both the article and I think it's a problem today that may eventually be overcome.  Also, cell coverage isn't the best analogy. That had an obvious solution (more towers) whereas the solution for rain/snow aren't as obvious because they affect the readings of LiDAR.   An alternative analogy might be the range of electric cars. It was originally considered a minor issue (batteries will surely get better over time, right?), but it proved more challenging than we thought."
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,michelevit,3,Fri Jun 26 20:12:49 2015 UTC,"So... several of those points were talking about an emergency stop causing a 'fatal collision' from behind  Surely this is a problem caused by people driving far too close to the car in front?  If the situation includes 2 self driving cars, then surely the second car wouldn't be driving too close in the first place, and would therefore have enough time to stop?  After all, driving too close is a very human problem"
SelfDrivingCars,3b66ia,Dustin_00,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:59:17 2015 UTC,"Right, I think the authors were trying to discuss how an SDC would distribute the risk among itself, the person in front, and the car behind in a situation like this. Fault is part of the equation, but not the only part. In a full-SDC environment, the specific example they gave would probably not be an issue.

We discussed this when I first became interested in autonomous vehicles (AVs) about 4 years ago.  There are several relevant items:   Heavy axle loads are the main problem (along with weather) - so its all about the heavy trucks (1 heavy truck does 4,000 time the damage to the road pavement as a car) If lane widths stay as they are then we could introduce a random 'wander' algorithm into the AVs control system, so that it sometimes drives closer to the white lines/striping than if it were keeping lane perfectly, to ensure a more even dsitribution of loading/pavement wear. Take the once in a lifetime opportunity with big vehicles to actually reduce their payload and therefore reduce axle loads. This would then mean that we would require more vehicles to move the same weight of goods, but would also mean lower pavement maintenance costs. Somewhere there is a balance between cost of moving goods and cost to maintain roads which will give the lowest overall cost to the public/society."
SelfDrivingCars,3b1q4q,PaulGodsmark,12,Thu Jun 25 13:40:20 2015 UTC,The random wander algorithm has been applied before - notably for aircraft landing at Atlanta Georgia with automatic instrument landing system.  They were getting the runways dinged up in two spots per runway where the landing gear first touched.  Wander fixed the problem.   I learned this in about 1992 working there.

Somewhere there is a balance between cost of moving goods and cost to maintain roads which will give the lowest overall cost to the public/society.   Another alternative is to simply correctly price traffic along particular roads for heavy vehicles.  States are already looking at moving to a use tax for roads rather than a fuel tax.  SDC could take it to the next level and actually charge different prices for vehicles depending on their axel weight and which roads they travel on.  Cities could work on engineering certain truck thoroughfares to better withstand heavier loads, and encourage trucks to use those by charging a lower price to stay on roads of the correct capacity.  Your weigh stations don't have to be only freeways, they could be built right into the suspension of the vehicle, impacting local trucks as well as interstate trucks.  If you overload the capacity of a road, expect a big tax bill next month."
SelfDrivingCars,3b1q4q,thatmorrowguy,2,Thu Jun 25 15:12:37 2015 UTC,He's talking about having to pave roads less frequently. That solution is superior to paving them more often and just having the money to do it.  You also can't charge all cars by their mileage as long as there are still human-driven vehicles on the roads. To do so requires having expensive electronics in a car that are trivial to jam and would be pretty much ineffective. It would encourage people to not use self-driving cars so they could pay less in road taxes.

Asphalt is very soft and governments set weight limits for roads for a lot of really good reasons. Our truck parking lot is not paved for this reason. It would be way too expensive to keep it maintained. Dirt holds up pretty well though."

You don't have to worry so much about where to park anymore, have the car drop you off then go find a parking spot on its own. It could even go to another parking lot down the street. Or all the suburbanites can send their cars back home after dropping them off somewhere, and schedule it to come back to pick them up afterwards, instead of wasting so much real estate on parking lots everywhere. Obviously this will need to be balanced against the additional fuel usage, but it has the potential to be a huge change to city planning, and potentially a very positive one. Parking lots are a major contributor to the urban heat island effect for example.  There are other benefits besides parking too. You can send your car out to fuel itself, get a car wash or get its oil change done while you're at work, or send it to the shop for maintenance or diagnostics without all the hassle that usually entails of finding another way of getting home after you've dropped off the car for the day and then going back to pick it up some unspecified time later."

But since you have to bear the costs of each trip individually (instead of having a ""free"" car sitting in your driveway), it's possible that people actually decrease their travel, or at least change it, since you become more aware of the cost of each trip.

These miles could be on a family plan, shared by everyone. Maybe you sign a long term contract for a discount, or maybe you go prepaid or month to month.   Anyway, the marketing point it to eliminate the constant need to approve $ for a trip.  People are very aware of gas prices and milk prices because they buy them all the time."

SelfDrivingCars,3b3rsr,Cordite,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I agree that focusing every ethics discussion on fatal crashes makes these scenarios seem unlikely. But the reality is that driving involves decisions that must balance the safety of different people in addition to one's value of time. These decisions are subtle, continuous, and occurring without your input. When there's no safe alternative, that's when these magnitudes we've assigned to various outcomes becomes very important. So while the ethics debate is not a show-stopper, it's much easier to address early in the design process than later in a court of law."

This is a manufactured issue, is my point.   Someone thought it was cute to talk about. It doesn't exist.  You tell it to avoid collisions - and if it cannot, it has (at the very least) done an equal or better job than any human could have done at avoiding the collision. Period. End of 'crisis'.  If it tried like hell and couldn't avoid the collision, I would bet my life (as a passenger), that it would have done the best anyone could do in the given situation or better. Is that not acceptable? We trust the average or below average driver every day.   This shouldn't be an emotional issue. It's a logical one. A statistical one. A mechanical one.

SelfDrivingCars,3ayadi,CallMeOatmeal,4,Wed Jun 24 15:45:39 2015 UTC,I believe the steering wheel is detachable and stored in the glovebox which is how they got around that regulation.
SelfDrivingCars,3ayadi,Vandalay1ndustries,4,Wed Jun 24 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"No, they didn't ""get around"" the regulation. It still needs to be attached and usable in order to operate on public roads during testing. If it didn't need a steering wheel for testing and there was no way to input control from a tester, it wouldn't really be a test, because at that point you've already decided your car is 100% safe without ever needing input from the person in the car, so there would be no need for further testing.  Aside from that, where are you getting that the steering wheel is able to be stored so compact it would fit in a glove box? I understand that they have retrofitted steering and pedals to testing cars, but I haven't seen anything about being easily detachable and stored in the glove box."
SelfDrivingCars,3ayadi,CallMeOatmeal,5,Wed Jun 24 16:02:34 2015 UTC,They can be removed once the driverless testing is approved.
SelfDrivingCars,3ayadi,walky22talky,-2,Wed Jun 24 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Right, but it's not as simple as removing the batteries from the remote, you can't detach it and ""store it in the glovebox.""

SelfDrivingCars,3az50k,PaulGodsmark,2,Wed Jun 24 17:46:55 2015 UTC,"Skimmed the first three, but I'm fairly confident that number 4 is wrong.    Misconception 4: Self-driving cars are controlled by classical computer algorithms (if-then rules)   While the author correctly acknowledges that the cars use machine learning to detect and categorize objects, he goes on to say that cars use machine learning techniques for everything else.   The learning approach can also be used for actions and evaluations. Instead of supplying the vehicle with a fixed evaluation scheme from which the right action for each situation can be deduced, the programmers feed the software with many traffic situations and specify the correct action for each situation.   Note the careful use of ""can be used"" instead of ""is used."" The author doesn't seem to have any evidence that this is the technique Google is using, and it doesn't match up with many of their patents on controlling vehicle behavior. From what I've seen, perception uses machine learning, not control. There's a probabilistic component, sure, but not in the outcome. I mean, just imagine if the car did something unusual and you had to re-train it in the hopes that it wouldn't do it again. That's insane. It's also not the way the auto industry is handling things.   I think what the author was trying to say is that their's not some huge lookup table for the billion scenarios, but that's not the same thing as machine learning."

It's the car which is 20 meters away, moving fast, and hidden which is far more of a risk than the car which is 2 football fields away.  Programming a car to understand what it can't see is pretty tricky.  Even moreso is programming a car to understand that actions of other drivers will give a clue to things it can't see.  (for example, a car on a multilane road starts slowing down at a crosswalk, yet nobody appears to be on the crosswalk.  That usually means there is in fact someone on the crosswalk, just they are hidden by another obstacle, and my self driving car should react accordingly)"

You start off with an idea and then by the time you think of all the practical things, it looks nothing like your original idea (see concept cars). Cars should be designed by automotive designers."

People will want self-driving cars badly.  I'm a typical case; drive a couple of times a day - need to; can't really use public transport.  But all that tax, insurance & depreciation is a LOT of money.  If I can hail a self-driving car on an app, that will be 1/3 the cost of taxis/Uber now (no humans involved) - i'll be happy to say bye, bye to personally owning a car & there are 10's if not 100's of millions of people like me all over the world, who cannot wait to get rid of our cars fast enough - they are just a financial burden."

SelfDrivingCars,3awa74,elektritekt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"I have a simple prediction. Some car company will soon stick their necks out with a automatic car that is good enough to enable sleeping behind the wheel. At this point anyone in heavy traffic who looks over and sees someone else happily asleep behind the wheel while they rage at their surroundings with their white-knuckled hands gripping the steering wheel, that person will instantly vow to buy an automatic car.   So I see automatic cars spreading like some kind of zombie virus where I even see people turfing their very new cars that they were very happy with, in order to buy an automatic car.   Thus the demand for automatic cars will so outstrip supply that the story won't be about people not having to drive but the lengths they will go to in order to obtain one.   The car companies will do whatever the hell they can to get them out as fast as they can. I could even see some car companies being forced to send out a refit kit for models that are sitting in the lot. If the demand is high enough it would make sense to take a $40,000 add a $10,000 kit to it and sell the car into the bidding war that might get them $60,000+ for that otherwise unremarkable car.  This madness will then go on for a while as a series of ever improving generations of automatic cars come out that are heading toward that magical point where they are fully autonomous and can be truly driverless.   To look fully into my crystal ball even that point where cars are autonomous still isn't the end as there will be a point where manually driven cars will be banned. A complete lack of manually driven cars then enables a few more generations of driverless cars to evolve as they will be free to do things that are impossible with human drivers about.  But where companies like Denso are in for a horrorshow is that those companies ready to pull the automatic trigger are going to do far better than those who have to come in and buy the technology. And this last bit is where the financial story will be interesting. Some companies like Google will probably have all kinds of ready to implement technologies that they can licence to all the latecomers."
SelfDrivingCars,3awa74,LessonStudio,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"Manual cars will probably be treated the same way old video games are today, unlikely to go out of fashion or be banned. We still live in a world where DOS is used for ATM's, people have Windows 95 and old Macintoshes, and some areas of the world relying on dial-up. So, basically, not everyone's going to get self-driving cars globally, whether it be for social or cultural reasons. Look at Cuba and the embargo, people patching up old cars.  Add retrocomputing and cultural interest in classic cars to that, and well, more problems start to come into it.  I am not a lawyer, but you probably won't be allowed to sleep behind the wheel, and the governments will still expect a ""driver"", at least if British law is anything to go by. Truly driverless cars may not be even allowed in some nations.  As for retrofitting cars, it may not even be possible for technical reasons or even legal ones.  This does not indicate me being for or against SDCs, just adding another perspective."
SelfDrivingCars,3awa74,axc86,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:28:02 2015 UTC,"This is how I once thought. But the critical factor here is dead people. Right now it is in the low 30 thousands for US car fatalities. This is down from a peak of around 55 thousand. But the number is getting stuck in the low 30s. The 3 big technologies were airbags, antilock brakes, and crumple zone (along with other crash reinforcements). Things like traction control have helped but the drop is stalling.   With 100% driverless cars this could drop to a number very close to 0. There will always be total freak accidents such as mechanical failure or boulders rolling down cliffs but by taking the human factor out we could potentially live out our entire lives without even knowing someone who knows someone lost in an auto accident (after 100% driverless).   Thus parents who lose children and whatnot will campaign without relenting until politicians ban manually driven cars. Also like with smoking in bars, schools, airplanes, it will be considered unacceptable to drive a manual car.   The insurance industry will fight this but the auto industry will fight for it. Minimally those two will negate each other's efforts, except that insurance will know it is a losing battle in the end whereas auto will know that great riches await.   The other critical factor will be when it is shown that the vast majority of accidents in automatic cars are caused by people taking control when the car would have done far better. At this point the recommendation will be that people pretty much not have the ability to control the car. This might seem like a hard argument but keep in mind that automatic cars by their very nature will have massive logging going on so accidents can be reconstructed and gamed through various scenarios proving mathematically that the car would have done better.   Plus people apparently are confident very very quickly when in driverless cars, thus it will become generally accepted to not pay any attention and simply go to sleep.  But you are right about some nations banning them. Britain completely screwed its early car industry with crazy laws that required that you have a flagman running ahead of the car with a red flag to warn people and horses that you were coming. I suspect the same with a few stupid countries. But leaders like Germany and Korea will jump in with both feet knowing that they will then have a n advantage as they want to prove the technology and then sell a zillion cars.   But many car companies seem to already be getting their cars ready for automation. In many fairly cheap cars the entire steering, gas, braking, shifting, etc are all fly by wire. Thus with a few sensors and a computer glued in they could go automated very easily with a kit. The key being that the kit could be added to a new car by the manufacturer and nothing would have really changed about the car except that now it will sell.   I feel a tiny bit sorry for any company (maybe Toyota) that is caught completely unaware and takes a year or more to get a full line of automatic cars out. They literally could find themselves losing money until they get them out and if they rush it could even be worse.  Think blackberry when the iPhone came out. They were kings of the high end phone universe and then boom, headshot. They floundered until they prematurely put out a smart phone that I heard had an effective 100% return rate. They are kind of catching up now technology-wise as their market share slips from 0.5% to 0.4%."

SelfDrivingCars,3avd0j,m3dos,4,Wed Jun 24 02:01:40 2015 UTC,"While that's true, there's a bunch of theoretical dangers already in any vehicle.  Lots of security research has shown that's feasible to hack into modern manual cars and control driving. There's no reason to believe that SDCs will be any more or less secure than this. Especially when many cars have systems and subsystems that could be exploited similarly already. Remote update already exists, it's not a new threat model that will prohibit remote update existing in the future."
SelfDrivingCars,3avd0j,fidelitypdx,3,Wed Jun 24 02:10:36 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to believe that SDCs will be any more or less secure than this.   I see lots of reason to believe that cars will get much more secure. Cars never had to deal with these kinds of threat, because they weren't an interesting target and lacked entry vectors. Now that cars are connected and have interesting functionality to exploit, the manufacturers are scrambling to close any threat vectors. They have realised what they have to change but it takes time to build new security-conscious systems from the ground up. Just like we saw with PCs when they first started to open up to connections from the outside during the 90's and early 2000's. Road vehicles will have to integrate many of the lessons learned and security requirements from other fields, e.g. airliners. But they will get there."
SelfDrivingCars,3avd0j,skgoa,3,Wed Jun 24 07:26:27 2015 UTC,"I see lots of reason to believe that cars will get much more secure.    Yes, indeed. I phrased my comment above poorly. I was intending to say that future-state SDCs will doubtfully be a primary target of malicious code, when someone who desires to write malicious code for automobiles could already do that today - security researchers have shown that virtually no computer security exists in the automobile industry today.   I think it's refreshing that legislatures are revamping security requirements because of the concerns around SDC, but in reality any concern about SDCs is equally applicable to any automobile with an onboard computer that controls driving functions.    Let's remember the conspiracy theories around Michael Hastings and his death - no one doubted that the US/UK or Chinese could use an automobile to assassinate someone, researchers proved that this hijacking was technically very feasible."

I definitely agree with you that the systems responsible for actual vehicle control will be heavily firewalled with strict controls over updating, and only done by licensed parties from within the vehicle.

SelfDrivingCars,3avd0j,leafhog,2,Thu Jun 25 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Traffic doesn't change all that much over the lifetime of a car. It is very variant depending on location but that can be solved via having a GPS chip etc. There is very little reason for car behaviour to adapt to anything it encounters in the wild, since it will always drive in a legal and safe manner and it will be difficult for the car to draw the correct conclussion from arbitrary situations it might encounter.   It would actually be a very bad idea to have cars learn to behave in unforeseen ways. If we had foreseen them, we would either have trained that behaviour - or decided against it - already. So there is no upsite to allowing this to happen. Safety-critical behaviour (which practically all higher level behaviours will be) will have to be verified and probably certified through meticulous tests. Cars should never ever deviate from these behaviours. Updates will probably be done during routine maintaince every year or so.   Also, a side note but it seems to be pertinent here: there are two distinct parts in every machine learning approach...   Training is typically done ""offline"", i.e. it is done on a big set of labeled/annotated training examples from which the ml algorithms builds a model.  Inference is what the computer does when it is presented with a new example (and the model ofc.) and is asked to generate the proper/best answer or labeling.    Astute readers will note that these two steps are only connected through the model. In fact you can exchange basically any algorithm for any other here, as long as they work on the same principle/model. (And sometimes you even do tricks like train a model of type a and then do inference on it pretending it is of type b.) There are approaches that enable online learning, i.e. updating the model after inference, but those have their own problems."

Public transit will end up being free and ad supported if it continues to exist at all."
SelfDrivingCars,3augdf,sweetmoses,11,Tue Jun 23 19:06:38 2015 UTC,"Even with perfectly driven automated cars, is there enough road capacity in a typical city for every last person to use a personal vehicle during a daily commute? I'm just thinking of how long it would take to empty a 100 story sky scraper at 5pm with each person getting into a personal vehicle vs. a huge majority of those people taking some kind of automated bus out to a designated node where they would then transfer to private vehicles.  I don't see why shared self driving vehicles won't be around. Especially when using smart phones to coordinate passengers some kind of large capacity vans or buses could drive custom, created-on-the-fly routes to pick up and drop off everybody in a super efficient pattern for a fraction of the price of having a private vehicle pick you up. And for a fraction of the price of running a static route, human driven bus system that's running whether people are riding them or not."
SelfDrivingCars,3augdf,greyGoop8,0,Tue Jun 23 19:31:52 2015 UTC,"Of course there's enough space. Human error creates traffic, unless there's some physical bottleneck or detour. We could easily accommodate 3 or 4 times more vehicles on the road.   In a 100 story skyscraper, the bottleneck is the parking garage. SDCs wouldn't necessarily need a parking structure, or they could queue up as their owners walk out. I'm not saying there couldn't be commuter buses, but they don't have to necessarily be supported publicly. And they end up being redundant because the person has to keep transferring vehicles.   The problem with large capacity SDC vehicles is that not many people are departing from the exact same place and going to the exact same place. Why would I take a van with an on the fly route when every car already has an on the fly route? What is the van giving me that the car isn't, besides other people I don't want to be around?

The article mentions that 20% of Uber rides are shared already. With greater integration of personal connectivity it will be increasingly easy to find people going in the same direction. The tradeoff is simply waiting a little longer and sharing to cut your transportation cost down for each person.  Our roads may be able to handle 4 times more vehicles with SDC tech, but is that what we want in a dense area? There will probably be some mechanism put in place to curb those numbers, like congestion charges. More incentive to share. Of course everyone would prefer to ride alone, but it'll cost more."

Heck, current volume isn't acceptable. The problem is that there isn't much a transportation agency can do about it now without reducing access. Once congestion charges become feasible, that all changes."
SelfDrivingCars,3augdf,elmer_fudd_8,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"Current volume is not a problem. Even higher volume wouldn't be a problem. Traffic caused by human error is the problem. There is plenty of space on roads currently, and studies have shown that adding lanes has a nominal effect on decreasing congestion. In a completely (or even mostly) automated system, the vehicles could communicate and dynamically flow around one another which would drastically increase allowable road density.   The best thing transportation agencies can do now is make sure all the roads and lane markings are adequate and our current infrastructure can last another 20 years. After that, streets may look a lot different than they do now."

Having cars first drive to work and then drive out of the city and then drive back to the city and then tack you home essentially would double the trafic volume in the city. A moving car will always take up more space than a still car. A subwaytrain can take 1000 people nearly no space on the street and continues to roll after you get off the train. It is vastly more efficient and faster."
SelfDrivingCars,3augdf,252003,0,Tue Jun 23 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"The reason that bus is less efficient is that it assumes that all of those people are going the same direction at the same time along the same route. That's not necessarily true of a random group of people.   Trains are efficient when ground level streets are congested. They could be useful for 50+ mile commutes, but   Cars do take up a lot of space, and we have a lot of roads that are super wide to allow for human lane tolerances. We could drastically increase the amount of cars per mile without human reaction time and safe traveling distances as an inhibitor.   If the cars are electric and commuting is cheap and on demand and you can go to sleep on your way home, then why would you want to be on a train? If it's free maybe some people would deal with the lack of privacy. But that number will be less than what it is today, simply because the lower cost of private transportation would attract people who don't really want to take public transportation. It's more efficient now and most people don't use it. Why would that change?"

That's not necessarily true of a random group of people.    So have more busses, public transport requires a fine net. Also most people work in central areas so busses leading from the center and out will serve most people. A bus will always be cheaper, have a lower environmental impact and take up a lot less space.  Trains will always use a fraction of the energy and a subway system doesn't really take space in a city.   https://kikibeije.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/20120709_kikibeije_gocc88tgatan.jpg At the T sign there are over 10 000 people who get on and off daily.

Trains will always be a lot cheaper, a lot more environmentally friendly and take a fraction of space. When I commuted by subway it took 30 minutes to get to work and 45 minutes by car. The car will never be that fast because of pedestrians. I don't see the problem, I have a seat and I can sit and code or watch an episode of a show.  Now I commute by rail to another city. I would never take the car because the train goes 150 km/h and zooms out of the city. Does your self driving car have a bathroom and a café?"
SelfDrivingCars,3augdf,252003,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:43:27 2015 UTC,"But buses are cheaper and have lower environmental impact and take up a lot less space now. Why do most people still deal with the liability and cost of owning a private vehicle? Because people like private transportation and are willing to pay for it. Everybody knows buses and trains save energy. That's not really a selling point.  Wherever that photo is from certainly isn't America. Our roads aren't built like that. We have plenty of space for cars to queue up and pick up their passengers as they come down the elevator. All 10,000 of those people didn't get there at the same time and they probably all had to walk there from a long distance. That's already not efficient.   SDCs don't necessarily have to stop for pedestrians, cyclists or other vehicles in an intersection. Like this.  Cars aren't fast now because of human error. There's no physical reason every car at a stop light can't accelerate simultaneously. The only reason that they don't is because of human reaction time. Eliminating that factor alone would drastically improve traffic flow and allow pedestrians to walk around freely.  The problem with trains is that except for a very few urban areas in the world, traffic isn't as routine as you'd like it to be. You can sit and watch an episode in a private SDC for the same price as the train. Except now you don't have to wait for it, you don't have to go underground with the rats, nobody else is in there with you, you don't have to transfer vehicles, and you don't have to walk from the station to your actual destination.   Everything you're saying about public transportation is true today. So why do people sit in traffic for 2 hours every weekday?  No, it doesn't have a bathroom or a cafe, but it can stop at both and I'm not restricted to the type of bathroom or cafe that the train offers. I can change my mind and stop by the pet store or Wendy's before I go home. With a train, or any public transportation really, I'm stuck to a predetermined route and I'm sitting next to strangers. If the cost is nominal for both, why would I choose to do that? If I'm traveling between cities like you, then of course a train is a better option because it's faster. But what happens when you get to your city and your house is across town? You still need something to get you over there. Can your train drop you off at your front door?"

The problem with large capacity SDC vehicles is that not many people are departing from the exact same place and going to the exact same place.   That's not true during a city commute though. Hundreds of thousands of people are going from the same city to the same suburban towns everyday at predictable times. Or from a financial center to the residential area of a city.  And during non-rush hour people don't have to be going to the same places. But if you're willing to accept a extra few minutes added onto your trip in exchange for a deep discount, a bus could pick people up along the way you're going anyway who are also wishing to go in the same general direction. And it could let you know exactly how long it ought to take so you can decide to get on the bus or pay a premium for a private car."

But both are 1/50th the price of what it is now, so I'd still prefer not to get drooled on by some random person. I think mass transit will be free by then though. So it will just be a question of pay vs. don't pay.   That's not true during a city commute though. Hundreds of thousands of people are going from the same city to the same suburban towns everyday at predictable times.    Nah, not exactly. Most cities' urban areas have swelled to what was the suburbs 20 years ago. So there's a lot of directional rush hour traffic of course, but there's also a lot of ancillary traffic as well that's not going with the predicted direction. Also, it assumes people only want to go straight from work to home, which isn't always true. People who take buses may operate that way now just as a function of the bus route, but I imagine most wouldn't mind the option of deviating from the exact same course everyday of their life.   Besides that, a bus will always take longer than a private car because it has to stop for everyone along the route. Even a bus in sight may stop 2 or 3 times before it actually stops for you. It's just not worth much when I can commute in a private car for $1.50. Why would I wait for a bus and share a ride just to save a couple bucks? Again, I can make that decision now, and I pay way more than $1.50 for a commute in my car. Why would I ever ride a bus if SDC cars are so cheap?"

SelfDrivingCars,3aq2pi,illjustcheckthis,0,Mon Jun 22 19:25:22 2015 UTC,That's great until you realize the vehicle behind you doesn't have this.    Does it make that much difference? You're going to stop quickly whether it's due to your breaks or ramming into something. Hitting something in front of you and being rear ended by the guy behind you aren't mutually exclusive--both happen all the time.
SelfDrivingCars,3aq2pi,Tiak,2,Tue Jun 23 18:43:44 2015 UTC,I think the part where they say it will only deploy up to 70 km/h because of danger to the driver caused by a much to sudden stop is an exageration. It will only deploy up to 70 because of the risk of loosing control of the vehicle at higher speeds. I'm willing to bet it all depends on the way the functional safety guys decided it whould be limited.  I seriously doubt that breaking as fast as it says is going to injure anyone in the car.
SelfDrivingCars,3aq2pi,illjustcheckthis,2,Mon Jun 22 21:26:41 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of injuries in car accidents are caused by car coming to too quick of a stop.  If you decelerate too quickly, without your airbag deploying, yeah, that is a pretty big risk...  I really don't see how such a system would plausibly cause you to lose control of a vehicle."
SelfDrivingCars,3aq2pi,La_Dude,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:12:50 2015 UTC,"Decelerating too quickly because of a car break and decelerating too quickly because of a wall impact are two very different things. I doubt sudden deceleration because of the break system( fancy as it may be) can cause any injuries if you have your seatbelt on.   As you know, breaking at certain moments definitely makes you loose control of your vehicle. And while breaking at 70 kph and loosing control is bad, it is not nearly as bad as breaking and loosing control at 120 kph. Some automatic breaking sensors do not work above a certain speed precisely because of this. And there's the whole ASIL level thingy.  And third, but not least, the break applies maximum decceleration as much as it can (to squeeze the smallest breaking distance). That maximum decceleration is the same, even if you break from 120 mph or from 70 mph, it's just applied for a longer time (and longer disatance). Ergo, a driver would not feel a greater G force, just a prolonged one."

I doubt sudden deceleration because of the break system( fancy as it may be) can cause any injuries if you have your seatbelt on.   Most things a car hits are not going to be a wall.  A car might more frequently hit, for example, another car.  When such a collision occurs, injuries often happen, even though the car that is struck is not held rigidly in position and allows for a much slower stop than striking a wall...    Or, for another, better non-wall example, a vehicle might easily strike a metal fence, lamp post, or sign post.  When this happens, the vehicle stops not so much because of the inertia of the object that is struck, but instead because the object that is struck connects the car to the ground, and can pull upon the ground to slow the vehicle.  In terms of the forces applied, this system does basically the same thing, essentially abruptly connecting the vehicle to the ground below it.   As you know, breaking at certain moments definitely makes you loose control of your vehicle.    What you're overlooking is why this happens.  Your regular brakes can cause you to lose control of your vehicle  because they can lock up your tires.  If your tires are no longer rolling  then the direction that they are pointing no longer matters; they become equivalent to rubber runners under the vehicle, and you have no control.  This braking system does not operate by slowing your tires, it operates by slowing your vehicle directly.  There is no way that this could possibly cause your tires to lock, up, and so no way which it could really prevent the direction of your steering from mattering.   And third, but not least, the break applies maximum decceleration as much as it can (to squeeze the smallest breaking distance). That maximum decceleration is the same, even if you break from 120 mph or from 70 mph, it's just applied for a longer time (and longer disatance). Ergo, a driver would not feel a greater G force, just a prolonged one.   This is mostly the case with wheel brakes, but, again, there is no reason that it is necessarily the case here.  When you deploy such a suction system, chances are it is going to gradually ramp effectiveness up to 100% over the course of the deployment, as everything moves into place and the pressure differential builds up.  If you have such a system, then higher-speed braking efforts are going to be much more jarring because a lower proportion of the total speed is going to be absorbed by the earlier phases.  But, more than that, it also how the braking works at issue again.  This system works by essentially attaching the car to the ground and transfering momentum to the earth in the process.  If the ground is moving away from the car faster, then the point at which the car is attached is going to be have a larger speed differential, and is thus going to deliver more force...  It's equivalent the difference between a ship dropping anchor at low speed or high speed.  One of the two is going to result in higher g-forces.  If you want to doubt the braking power, then believe that the system simply fails and destroys itself if you attempt to use it at too great of a speed, because this is also plausible enough, but it is rather unlikely to cause you to lose control of the vehicle."

In terms of the forces applied, this system does basically the same thing, essentially abruptly connecting the vehicle to the ground below it.   While true, most accidents with a pole would not cause severe harm because of sudden deceleration. Maybe because of plastic deformation to the car, or shrapnel from the accident, both of witch are not the case in a sudden, abrupt, intentional break.    This braking system does not apply operate by slowing your tires, it operates by slowing your vehicle directly. There is no way that this could possibly cause your tires to lock, up, and so no way which it could really prevent the direction of your steering from mattering.    It slows your vehicle directly by applying a supplemental force on the back of a car. You can't ""stop it directly"", you a apply some other force that helps stop the vehicle faster. That force is in the back of the vehicle, imagine being in a curve and suddenly the system deploys... What happens? It will apply a force in the back of the car opposing the previous direction of travel. That imparts a spin on the vehicle that orients it with the front towards your previous direction, thus making you loose control.    This is mostly the case with wheel brakes, but, again, there is no reason that it is necessarily the case here. When you deploy such a suction system, chances are it is going to gradually ramp effectiveness up to 100% over the course of the deployment, as everything moves into place and the pressure differential builds up. If you have such a system, then higher-speed braking efforts are going to be much more jarring.   While the ramping of effectiveness is true, that ramping  is near instantaneous and even if it takes a while it definitely takes less than the whole 10 meters it takes to break. If that is so, at some point, the driver will have felt the maximum G that he will feel no matter the speed he is breaking from. I really cannot prove to you 100% that the ramping is faster than breaking from 70 kph, at least not without extra data about the system, but I believe it is so. Even if it were not, you can easily withstand far more G's than the breaking in the video (and this I CAN prove, just read on).  So what G force does the driver actually endure during the break in the video? Well, we know that at 50kph it breaks in 10.8 meters.   distance=(speed/2)*(breaking time).   Braking time=(2*distance)/speed; 50 kph = 13,888888 m/s  dt(that's the breaking time)= 2*10.8/13.88888 = 1.5552 seconds  a(acceleration) = v/dt=13,888888/ 1.5552=8.930612m/s2. Whoopty fucking doo... that's not even 1 horizontal G.   Let's compose the acceleration (only fair):  total acc.=sqrt( 8.932 + 9.82 )= 13.25m/s2  Total g's = total acc/g=13.25/9.8 =  1.35204081633 g's  That's the composed acceleration (accounting for earth's gravity). In order to be hurt by the braking itself, you'd need to get to far higher g's.   Of course, not having a seat belt and smashing your face against the windshield is painful and can hurt you, but then again, that's valid in the case of normal braking also. Assuming you have your seat belt on, you're fine.  As a side note, I've taken a ride with a car equipped with some new, fancy braking system (not this one, some other, more conventional tech) and it's pretty cool. You can feel the deceleration quite well and if you don't have the seat belt it can be bad for you. But if you have the seat belt, braking, no matter how fast, is no biggie."

The breaks are hit, there is nothing holding you back, you fly through the windshield at a little under 60 mph, the windshield slows you down a little, but you basically hit the wall at 60 mph.  b. The breaks are hit, but the force isn't powerful to make you fly through the windshield, at most you hit the dash. By the time the car hits the wall, you're traveling 30 mph, you again go through the windshield, but now hit the wall at only a little under 30 mph.  I'm sure you're dead either way, but might have a slightly higher chance of survival in the second scenario. I guess the point of the story is wear your seat belt."

I have also seen a picture of a site pickup truck that was reversed over by one of these beasts - apparently it is possible to do this and the large truck driver not notice... I have also heard rumours that such incidents are not uncommon hence the need for training videos like this one. Notice the driver later on in the video says that it is possible on undulating and rutted roads to not notice the bump of running over a pickup truck.  The question here being, should it even be possible for this to happen?  The article didn't cover some human aspects - I understand that it is difficult to get the right people to drive these trucks, they can have off days, they need to take regular breaks, they need additional spare drivers in case of sick days etc. The automated truck will simply be more consistent in the long term.   I suspect that safety will be the number one issue that sees automated trucks go mainstream in the oil patch, but emissions and operational efficiency would probably be high on the mind of senior managers in the oil companies.

If they don't support over the air updates then all updates will have to come during maintenance.

Imaginary example: Company Z invents object detection based on midi-chlorians, and no longer needs sonar, RADAR, LIDAR, or vision-based systems. Company Z's product would fail regression tests because it no longer responds to the common testing interface.

Google must already face this data normalization issue as they iterate on hardware. I'm curious how they deal with this. Someone should ask. Pay people to drive around in cars outfitted with all of the sensors! Essentially you're right it requires we define an interface, but perhaps we could allow for a bunch of interfaces. Drive around capturing scans, video and audio with the aim of building a full computer generated reconstruction of the drive. Companies and sensor manufacturers could then mock how different sensors in different configurations would behave within the simulation.

These are people of all ages.  So when marketers are looking to see who might be interested in buying/using a self-driving car I think that there are some markets that might be very well hidden at first blush."
SelfDrivingCars,3aegaa,LessonStudio,3,Sat Jun 20 00:51:35 2015 UTC,"I was a non-emergency medical transportation driver, and I talked to the people I was scheduled to pick up. Most of them live alone, far away from a bus stop, or live in rural areas where their powered wheelchair can't go. Whenever I pick them up once a month to go to their doctor appointments, they usually tell me to pick them up an hour or two after the appointment is finished, because they go out and shop or just wanted to be outside.  When I was recovering from my weak heart muscle, I also was in that seat: not going out because I feel too tired to drive, or dreading doctor appointments because I have to drive, especially with traffic.  I just hope they can make a car that won't make me have motion sickness if I'm not driving."

SelfDrivingCars,3aegaa,Snoron,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:31:20 2015 UTC,"Taxis cost a lot because there's a human driving it, and also because of fuel, maintenance, and other costs.  Compare an electric + SDC at once for the real difference. You first cut off over half of the cost that goes to the human driver, but then from the remainder you have far less maintenance, longer life-span, energy cost goes to about 10% of what it was.  All in all an electric SDCs total running costs could be around 5% of what a traditional taxi is today.  We'll probably never see actual prices that are 20x lower, and there are other overheads to recoup (up front cost of electric, technology, and off-site costs) whereas taxi services are usually run in a more bare-bones way... and you can see why, because they really need to ensure there aren't any more costs on top of what are already there.  But:   If they can afford one, they can afford the other.   Is definitely not going to be the case!  As long as we have multiple companies offering the service, the markups won't be too high. Price is king, and we already have strong competition building in this field (Uber, Google, and others) before the service even exists!"
SelfDrivingCars,3aegaa,LessonStudio,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:28:25 2015 UTC,Minimally you can remove the cost of the driver. Also drivers are a larger cost than most people think because you aren't only paying for the driver's time while they drive you but in order to make it worthwhile their idle time is also factored into the cost.   But other factors come into play. A robot taxi can sit indefinitely as their is no cost difference between having it sit in the warehouse or waiting for a fare. Thus taxi availability at the slowest times of the day will be insane. Also taxi driver availability can be a limiting factor in load management. Removing this factor leaves the taxi company largely with the remaining factor of car availability. This means that there is a higher probability that they will be able to deliver the most cars to the most customers. This reduces the cost of non-performing cars.   My back of the envelope calculation is that with a SDC and present day car costs that the price to the customer will have the potential to more than halve.  Plus who tips a robot?

I am not referring so much to an occupied car, seeing that it would be uncomfortable, but an empty car could certainly take corners/acceleration/braking right out to the edge while being entirely safe. If anything if there are no potential victims (driving down an empty highway with nothing along the sides of the road, why not have the car going 200km/h and taking the turns at speed?

Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident.  2010 May: (rear-ended while in manual mode) ​A Google Prius model autonomous vehicle (AV) operating in manual mode was involved in an accident on Central Expressway in Mountain View, CA. The Google AV was stopped at a traffic light at Ferguson Drive and was rear-ended by another vehicle. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  2011 August: (employee rear-ended another vehicle in manual mode) ​A Google Prius model AV operating in manual mode was involved in an accident on Charleston Road in Mountain View, CA. An employee operating the Google AV to run an errand (i.e., he was not using the vehicle to test our autonomous technology) rear-ended a vehicle that was stopped in traffic. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  2012 October:​ (rear-ended while in autonomous mode) A Google Prius model AV operating in autonomous mode was involved in an accident on Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View. The Google AV was stopped at a traffic light and was rear-ended by another vehicle. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  December:​ (rear-ended while in manual mode) A Google Lexus model AV operating in manual mode was involved in an accident while driving on Highway 101S in Mountain View near the Moffett exit. The Google AV was driving past a disabled vehicle and emergency vehicles, which were stationary on the shoulder, when it was rear-ended by another vehicle traveling at approximately 20-25 MPH. No injuries were reported at the scene. The rear of the Google AV sustained some damage.  2013 March:​ (while in autonomous mode, driver took manual control after another car veers into same lane) A Google Lexus model AV operating in autonomous mode was involved in an accident while driving on highway 680S in San Jose. The Google AV was driving at 63 MPH when another vehicle traveling in the adjacent right hand lane veered into the side of the Google AV. At the time of impact, the test driver took immediate manual control of the Google AV via the steering wheel. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  October: (rear-ended while in manual mode) ​A Google Lexus model AV operating in manual mode on Rengstorff Avenue in Mountain View was involved in an accident. The Google AV was traveling at 2 MPH, gradually slowing to a stop at an intersection, when it was rear-ended by another vehicle. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  2014 (rear-ended while in autonomous mode) March: ​A Google Lexus model AV operating in autonomous mode traveling on Highway 101N near Belmont was involved in an accident. The Google AV was stopped in traffic when it was rear-ended by another vehicle. The vehicle that struck the Google AV was initially hit from behind by another vehicle. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  July: ​(rear bumper struck while in manual mode) A Google Lexus model AV operating in manual mode was involved in an accident on Phyllis Avenue in Mountain View. The Google AV was stopped on Phyllis Avenue waiting to make a right turn onto Grant Avenue when another vehicle struck the rear bumper of the Google AV. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  2015 February​: (while in autonomous mode, driver took manual control after another car runs stop sign) A Google Lexus model AV was travelling northbound on El Camino Real in autonomous mode when another vehicle travelling westbound on View Street failed to come to a stop at the stop sign at the intersection of El Camino and View Street. The other vehicle rolled through the stop sign and struck the right rear quarter panel and right rear wheel of the Google AV. Prior to the collision, the Google AV’s autonomous technology began applying the brakes in response to its detection of the other vehicle’s speed and trajectory. Just before the collision, the driver of the Google AV disengaged autonomous mode and took manual control of the vehicle in response to the application of the brakes by the Google AV’s autonomous technology. The Google AV was in manual mode. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.  April:​ (rear bumper struck while in autonomous mode) A Google Lexus model AV was involved in an accident in Mountain View while travelling northbound on Castro St and making a right turn onto El Camino eastbound. The car was operating in autonomous mode at the time of the accident. The Google AV was travelling northbound in the rightmost lane of Castro St and came to a complete stop for a red light at the intersection of Castro St and El Camino Real. The Google AV then proceeded to make a right turn on red by creeping forward to obtain a better field of view of cross traffic on El Camino Real approaching from the left. While creeping forward, the Google AV detected a vehicle approaching eastbound on El Camino Real and came to a stop in order to yield to the approaching vehicle. The Google AV was just starting to move (<1 MPH) when the vehicle following immediately behind it, which was also attempting to make a right turn onto El Camino Real, failed to brake sufficiently and struck the Google AV’s bumper at approximately 5 MPH. All occupants of both vehicles involved were uninjured in the collision. The Google AV sustained minimal body damage and the other vehicle sustained no visible body damage.  April: ​(brushed by another vehicle while in autonomous mode) A Google Lexus model AV was stopped for a red light at an intersection of California Street and Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View when another vehicle tried to pass from behind on the right side of the Google AV. The driver of the other vehicle slightly brushed one of the sensors on the Lexus AV with its driver side mirror. The Google AV was in autonomous mode. No injuries were reported at the scene, and there was no damage to either the sensor or either vehicles.  May: ​(rear bumper struck while in autonomous mode) A Google Lexus model AV was travelling southbound on Shoreline Boulevard in Mountain View in autonomous mode and was stopped behind traffic at a red light at the intersection of Shoreline Boulevard and El Camino Real. A vehicle approaching from behind collided with the rear bumper and sensor of the Google AV. The approximate speed of the other vehicle at the time of impact was 1 MPH. There were no injuries reported at the scene by either party. The Google AV sustained minor damage to its rear sensor and bumper. There was no visible damage to the other vehicle.

From what it looks like, Google's car will brake if it detects an imminent collision, regardless of from what direction that collision comes from. A human might have sped up in this case to avoid the car. From what I can tell, this is the only report of the car actually making a mistake. It will be interesting to see how Google and others deal with exceptional situations like this where other drivers don't even close to follow the rules of the road. Gathering data for these instances is extremely difficult because they are much more rare."

From what I can tell, this is the only report of the car actually making a mistake   It's not a mistake. Speeding up would have been risky in itself. Unless you can guarantee that the other car won't hit you, you are just introducing more energy into the situation and you are losing vital time/distance not being on the brakes. Secondary impacts are a big problem in otherwise mundane collision. Engaging the brakes is practically always the correct course of action to get closer towards a safe state and thus ensure the minimal amount of injuries. Body panels on a car can be repaired."
SelfDrivingCars,3abj1k,skgoa,2,Tue Jun 23 10:08:08 2015 UTC,"March 2013 is interesting (also one of the few accidents where it didn't get rear ended). Looks like another car veered into the AV's lane and hit it on it's side - the thing I'm wondering is why couldn't the AV  sense the car getting too close to it's side and steer to the left of the lane to avoid the accident.  My take from reading this report is that the AVs are generally good at following the rules but lacking in actively avoiding collision. For example, a lot of those rear end accidents should be pretty easily avoided if the AV just moved forward a few feet in response to the car behind coming too close (for those very low speed ones)."

SelfDrivingCars,3a8rlm,qfe0,4,Thu Jun 18 16:09:06 2015 UTC,"There's little discussion on the trolley problem specifically, but a decent amount on ethical systems generally.   Sebastian Thrun, the face of the Google car for its first few years, was asked a variation on this once. He basically said that choosing between two different cars to hit, the Google car would hit the smaller one. It wasn't a great question, and he didn't have time to elaborate.  Chris Gerdes of Stanford has a paper about implementing an ethical system in an autonomous vehicle. He's got a ton of experience with this stuff, and a few autonomous cars of his own, but he's not in industry. I've heard they've got a much more technical discussion coming in a future paper.  Brad Templeton has consulted on the Google car and own a few patents, and has basically dismissed the trolley problem and most ethics discussion. We discussed his article here.  Here's a few papers on SDC ethics from an engineer, but he's a civil engineer and doesn't work with SDCs directly. He also doesn't discuss the trolley problem directly, but some variants. [1] [2] [3]  And one from Patrick Lin, a philosopher, who looks at ethics a bit more broadly. Not what you were looking for, but he's written the most on the topic so I have to include him.  I'm very interested in the topic, if you can't tell.

Indeed it is contrary to a previous ruling by the same commission, which concluded in 2012 that the driver 'performed services as an independent contractor, and not as a bona fide employee.' Five other states have also come to the same conclusion. It's important to remember that the number one reason drivers choose to use Uber is because they have complete flexibility and control.

Most mapping companies collect high resolution camera footage to give the person in the office something to map from, but Google just spends the time to make it publicly available.   You can't just throw a picture into a computer and make a perfect 3D map.  Ideally the car will eventually be able to decide for itself what it's seeing and make decisions in real time. Right now it's much more dependent on the map and uses the real time data for more reactionary stuff like avoiding cars/pedestrians. One day it will flip the other way."

SelfDrivingCars,3a5xci,driverlesstrans,2,Wed Jun 17 14:08:04 2015 UTC,"Driverless cars can perform on the streets of sunny California, but can they handle a muddy field in the rainsoaked Highlands?  Jaguar Land Rover is working on an answer.  The maker of the rugged Defender is applying its allweather, off­road ethos by developing a system of sensors that would help make driverless cars viable in a range of difficult driving environments and weather conditions.  That will include the use of “structured light”, whereby a pattern of light is projected on to the road ahead of the car, measuring the topography of the ground. JLR is using similar technology to help car in future react to potholes.  “We know our customers drive in heavy rain and snow and bright desert sunshine every day,” said Wolfgang Epple, JLR’s director of research and technology. “Any future autonomous Jaguar or Land Rover must be as capable on rough tracks and unpaved roads as it would be on city streets.”  Great things are expected of the autonomous car, which has the potential to reduce accidents, alleviate the tedium of driving and offer mobility to those less able to drive. Google has made strides with its own autonomous technology.  But the system of lidar (a sort of laser), radar and ultrasonic cameras linked with on­board algorithms tends to struggle in intense sunlight, inclement conditions, or where road markings are obscured or absent.  JLR has an advanced research programme under way at its Warwick university facility to work out how structured light could be used alongside other sensors to navigate in areas without highdefinition mapping or connected roadside infrastructure, such as traffic lights. But such “contextual” awareness is not expected in production models until beyond 2025.  JLR was a pioneer of road­going autonomous technology. The 1996 Jaguar XK was the first production model to feature adaptive cruise control, which allowed the car to adjust to the speed of the vehicle in front.  The company is taking part in driverless car trials soon to be conducted in parts of the UK.  As part of an event at its engineering centre in the Warwickshire village of Gaydon, JLR will on Tuesday also unveil prototype technology that allows Range Rovers to be remote­controlled by smartphone on tricky terrains.  That would allow the driver to get out of the vehicle, assess the positioning, and walk alongside the car during rock crawling. It would also work for driving a car through a narrow gap while towing a caravan, say, or extricating the vehicle from a very tight parking space.  Regulations in most countries say a driver must at all times be behind the wheel and able to take control, though JLR says the required changes in the law are “relatively small”.  The Coventry­based manufacturer, which is owned by Tata Motors of India, will also signal an end to the dreaded three­point turn by showing off an extension of the parallel parking technology seen on current production models such as the Ford Focus.  A driver would be able to carry out a 180­degree turn without using either the steering wheel or the pedals."

Car sharing as you're describing means fewer cars in parking lots at any given time, not fewer cars on the road. If I'm using fleet service I'm still going to take all the same trips I do now, maybe even more. That's going to result in a car being on the road exactly as much as my personal car is now and perhaps more even if I don't travel more due to empty miles.   Now if people ride share more (possible) or travel less (unlikely) that could reduce the number of cars on the road."

So yes my responsive does not necessarily result in less total vehicles that use the roads.   But yeah, ride-sharing is the only way to see substantial VMT reductions (and thus roadway preservation); if vehicles are allowed to pickup new passengers while serving current ones. In my mind, this is a necessity for the mature stages of deployment because that is how the fuel-saving, congestion, etc. benefits are best realized.  Edit formatting."

I didn't do a very good job with the labeling, but the column labeled ""Cars"" Is what the fleet size would be if it correlated exactly with horses. The column labeled ""Total Fleet Estimate"" is the estimate from the research I'm doing for the total fleet size (our guess is as good as yours but thats what we came up based on some rudimentary number crunching). The column labeled ""Traditional Cars Estimate"" is from that same research but only counts traditional cars.    If you subtract the ""Traditional Cars Estimate Column"" from the ""Total Fleet Estimate"" column, you would get our estimate of all self-driving cars, both owned or part of a shared fleet. I just put those numbers there for reference, but they aren't very useful since the graphic isn't very clear, haha.   Yea, I'm not sure the parallels go that far, I just thought I would throw it out there since I've seen a bunch of stuff out there comparing horses to SDC (like this: http://declineofscarcity.com/?p=27).    Usually people parallel them in arguments to prove that something that can seem so indispensable can soon become disposable. I think it's possible that the entire ownership model of cars shifts to a shared system (eventually). This shift would leave traditional car owners in about the same category as horse owners: enthusiasts, people who live in the country, or people who own a stable/course and teach lessons to people learning it as a hobby. If that is how ownership will shift, it is interesting to study the decline of something that went from useful to not-useful.  Obviously there are a lot of differences. One of the biggest that I see being that there are a lot more cars per person than horses per person then. Another is, SDCs could drive on the same infrastructure as regular cars, whereas completely new roads had to be designed around cars. Then again, new roads will probably be designed around SDCs eventually."

I think there is something like a 5cm accuracy requirement by car manufacturers for lanes, crosswalks and barriers. Only a few cities are mapped with this accuracy as well as most hwys. Hopefully, this will change and onboard sensors and compute power improves. GPS will have to improve as well, maybe with correlation to the more accurate map."
SelfDrivingCars,39x5zu,hedyedy,4,Mon Jun 15 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree that the HD maps are the limiting factor. I think at this point it is more about the edge cases and the software to interpret the environment. The HD maps could pretty easily be created - look at how quickly it took google to implement street view across most of the US. They could easily do that now if they wanted, but their focus is to establish the safety of the vehicles over a small area. They'll probably put another 1-2 million miles on their prototype vehicle in mountain view, and then depending on those results, and possibly joining with a manufacturing partner will start deploying them quite quickly."

But the real question should be, can driverless cars break that plateau? Most cars still on the road still don't have any of the 'driverless' safety features, such as automatic breaking, lane departure warnings, etc. While airbags and seatbelts helped bring down crash deaths to where we're at now, driverless cars are the next step in taking crashes down to basically 0."

This is opposed to active safety features, which aim to prevent the crash in the first place. What we're seeing now is a plateau in how safe we can make cars using passive safety systems. Any improvements on the passive safety side from here on out will only yield marginal results. In order to continue the rate of safety improvements that have occurred for the past 100+ years, we need regulation requiring more active safety features such as emergency braking and lane keep assist to receive a good safety rating, eventually making these requirements. Of course we already have active safety features suck as anti-lock brakes and Electronic Stability Control, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. I believe self driving vehicles will be the inevitable result of the move to a completely active safety system, however I think there's plenty of room to save lives in between the transition by way of active safety features that are on many high-end human-driven cars on the road today. We need these systems to trickle down to budget vehicles."

SelfDrivingCars,39wtq7,PaulGodsmark,2,Mon Jun 15 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Vehicle ADAS systems are continuing to improve and see a reduction in crashes. Road safety is traditionally based around the 3'E's of engineering, enforcement and education and we are seeing gains through all of these measures.  However, in my opinion, any improvements in safety that these 'E's are making are being undone by a very significant increase in driver distraction - plus the vehicles are getting so safe to have a crash in that people can get away with being even careless/distracted than ever before - until the point that they have pushed the envelope too far and they have 'the crash'.  I don't know how much an improvement in road safety we would see if we could completely ban the use of in-vehicle smart devices, but I suspect it would be a big improvement.  But the public are demanding more and more in-vehicle connectivity and to keep sales up the automakers are providing it. Also the cell service providers and cell phone companies currently have not been given a regulatory reason to limit the use of personal smart devices in vehicles.  I think the only sensible long-term solution to our connectivity addiction and the related road safety problem is fully self-driving vehicles."

In addition to driving, these people hand deliver packages and food. If you are one of the lucky few to still have a job, you may notice a UPS or FedEx person walking the boxes around the building. These people will still be in the vehicles delivering, but not driving. This increases the number of people able to do the job, suppressing wages.  SDVs have the side effect of making same day delivery easier, further hurting traditional brick and mortar stores. Once somebody figures out how to do perfect quality control on vast amounts of different types of food, expect grocery stores to be added to the endangered list of brick and mortar stores."

I wouldn't want the pizza guy leaving my pizza on the porch while I'm at work if you know what I mean.  For packages that can sit for a few hours, I think maybe we'll see a rise in local drop boxes.  I order something online, someone from the warehouse puts it in a self driving vehicle, the vehicle drives to my local dropbox that services my immediate neighborhood where a staff member there unloads my package and puts it in a locker for me to pick up at my convenience.  If the dropbox were within a block of my house, that would still be pretty convenient.  EDIT: and if they still wanted to do door to door service, staff from the local dropbox could hand deliver all of the packages to the immediate neighborhood on foot or in a little mail car, but the majority of the distance packages travel would still be done in unmanned SDV's."

A robot that knows which package in the vehicle is yours, can carry it regardless of its form factor, can drop it at your house which may have stairs or a gate or a gravely or dirt walkway, other landscaping that might be tough to navigate around, etc. is going to be a huge technical challenge.  It makes way more sense to have humans doing the work of unloading and loading the vehicles, and/or front door delivery.

With a conventional electric car the battery is both the heaviest and most expensive component. A shorter range battery readily swapped seems viable, but would require considerable infrastructure investment.   Looking at how many there are expressing concerns about getting cooties in shared taxis, a premium service would want to take extra precautions to garauntee cleanliness. This could mean the cars will be making pit stops every trip or 3. A good time to swap the battery- and an interesting proposition if the range of an urban vehicle maxed out at 50 km or possibly way less."

Unless supercapacitors suddenly get a huge performance boost over the next ten years, we won't have any SDVs using them.   Robocars will eventually often be small single-person vehicles with very low weight compared to today’s cars. In fact, most of their weight might be battery if they are electric.   Very unlikely. No matter how small you make the cars, it's still more efficient to have a single vehicle that can hold more people. We may have some single person vehicles, but I don't think it will be the majority of vehicles, especially if multiple passengers will drop the per person charge. Vehicle weight will not be reduced due to SDV technology, they can still crash due to a software or hardware failure."

In a small vehicle this is very, very, very efficient (more than Japanese trains are today) and people demand, and will pay a lot for, the convenience of door to door transportation.   If personal door to door costs 25 cents/mile, do you think people would really ride with others just to save small amounts of money?  On what basis?"
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,walky22talky,16,Wed Jun 10 15:49:47 2015 UTC,This title is misleading. Elon musk said that in 3 years they will have the technical capability to have fully automated cars. And then he went on to say another year to three years after that before the regulators to give the OK to manufacture it into their cars. So actually 4-6 years before Tesla will sell a fully automated vehicle
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,day-maker,31,Wed Jun 10 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"Musk routinely underestimates how long it takes to solve and implement difficult problems. As far as his timelines are concerned, he's behind on everything. Of course, his timelines are completely unrealistic, and if you ignore them then he's actually way ahead of any reasonable estimate of how long it takes to do something like -say- build a rocket company from scratch."
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,fricken,2,Wed Jun 10 17:13:45 2015 UTC,For this its probably not too far off. With the update Tesla is putting out for a couple of its car models that give them limited automation it wouldn't be hard to see them releasing further updates in the next three years that will advance those abilities. Plus newer models will likely have newer sensors and faster computers to allow them more complete self driving capabilities. Three years doesn't sound too far off in those terms.

I agree that with the number of people working on the software side it's almost sure to be solved, but it's still a far more difficult task than building a car. Building a car at this point is not a difficult task--it's just an expensive one.

SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:08:14 2015 UTC,My point is that the barrier to entry to car manufacturing is high and will always be high. Whereas the barrier to entry to self driving technology is currently high but will one day not be high. Neither Tesla nor Uber can build an SDC until the tech is figured out. But then Uber still has the extremely high hurdle of actually building a car.   I think you're vastly underestimating the difficulty of building a car and getting it approved for use on the road. It took Tesla 8 years. What makes you think it will take Uber any less? Money? Money wasn't Tesla's problem with bringing a car to market.
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,sweetmoses,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not underestimating the difficulty of anything. It's expensive and time consuming, at least on a large scale, but not particularly hard. Google, for example though, has $60 billion in the bank. That's enough to build their own factories or buy somebody like Ford or GM outright.   Not that that's necessary, though, because you can just create licensing arrangements and partnerships with the people already building the cars, which is what I expect is most likely to happen."
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"Ford's market cap is $60 billion and GM's is $57 billion. So no, Google can't buy either of them outright. Google at least has a prototype model that functions, and they're still a few years away from building a commercially sellable vehicle. And Uber is even farther behind them.  You can't just license a car. You can license SDC tech, which again is what makes the barrier to entry lower. But GM won't build a car and license it to Uber or Google, they'll sell it.  Most likely Google will license tech to all of the auto companies and also build limited models themselves. It's the same business model as their phones really. But again, Uber is nowhere near any of the above. They could be the first to perfect SDC tech, but if they're not then they become irrelevant really fast. That's really what their shareholders are betting on."
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,sweetmoses,3,Fri Jun 12 17:10:45 2015 UTC,"Just a software problem? That's like saying we already know Newton's laws of motion, getting to the moon is just a rocket problem."
SelfDrivingCars,39b5kp,yaosio,-1,Thu Jun 11 13:06:18 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. It's like the genome. Ten years ago we didn't have a completely mapped human genome. But we knew several groups of smart and well-funded people were working on the problem and eventually there would be a solution. Now, the genome can fit on a thumb drive and it's public knowledge. The same is true of self driving technology. We all know one day it will be figured out, and we all know today is not that day. But when the day comes, it'll be ubiquitous. So Tesla could just license or buy the software when it becomes available, only if they don't figure it out themselves by then. So yeah, it's just a software problem.

For instance, there will be a liability issue regarding chain of custody on goods transported by a driver-less transport truck. Let's say a shipment of TV's shows up without any products in the trailer. Traditionally, the truck driver assumes responsibility for the goods while in transport, but without a driver, insurance companies might not insure the goods. The Teamsters Union might then require a ""driver"" to just sit in the truck and watch Netflix while the truck drives itself.   To be clear, I'm not advocating against driver-less transport trucks.

Trucking companies can get bonded for loss of goods, that's not really a problem. And the liability of goods getting stolen on a self driving truck are much less than a human driven truck. Self driving trucks don't need to stop for any reason but fuel, and never need to cut their engines off until they reach their destination. They're almost always moving, so except for a Fast and Furious type robbery, the goods are safer than with a human.

I looks like fun to drive the giant machine, and it is, but the new wears off quickly when you have to take corners at 4 mph.

The road is literally different, different slope, different grade, different traction every time the truck drives the same road because the weight of the truck changes it.  The truck is differently balanced every time it's loaded.  On the surface it seems like an ideal environment - no question of liability, private property, replacing expensive labor, but that labor is expensive for a reason."

A CPU can continuously check and recheck sensors and adjust it's driving to precisely match conditions. A CPU can make a round trip in the same amount of time, every time, making the dragline operator's job predictable; it keeps things running smoothly. An excellent driver might beat a average programmer most of the time, but even an average programmer can beat average drivers consistently.

SelfDrivingCars,3995k1,NFeKPo,3,Wed Jun 10 13:10:34 2015 UTC,The fact that the jobs become obsolete is a net good.  The bad part is our economic system isn't setup to distribute the gains.  So instead of lowering weekly work hrs or the same pay to match the productivity gain people are just moved out of the workforce.  Before soon we will only need 20% of the people to take care of everything for everyone.  This is what it means when people talk about capitalism not being sustainable.
SelfDrivingCars,3995k1,joshamania,4,Wed Jun 10 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"Because the job will be done cheaper (long term) and more efficiently.  A robot can work ~24 hours a day minus maintenance.  You can program the truck to drive at optimal speed/track 100% of the time and not worry about if the driver is paying close enough attention.   Yes it sucks that some people are going to lose their job but this also means that high tech jobs were created.  Someone has to program the truck and maintain the sensors.    Also you shouldn't worry about technology taking over jobs.  100 years ago there would need to be 1,000 men with shovels to dig holes.

Google's experience has already told them this does not work, which is why the Google designed cars have no controls. Trying to stop an in-progress collision is a lot harder than preventing it in the first place. Letting a person take control at any time will lead to collisions and rollovers when people take over at the wrong time.  Tesla is working in the same direction as Baidu, slowly adding new SDV features over time. At a certain point, they'll need to skip over some SDV technology and go straight for full automation."

I mean, if it were a designated standardised test parkour prescribed by a national or better yet international body, that would be good at evaluating these systems for approval. But for development you will want to run as many miles as possible on as varied roads as possible. Once you have mastered a road it loses most of it's value as a testing ground. Most of the major players in vehicle automation are beyond the stage where this Automated Corridor will yield significant insights. Though manufacturers might send their cars there to build a good track record. The Virginia DOT could build awareness of this scheme and market themselves to the public as the place where a manufacturer simply has to go test for their vehicle to be a credible entrant, like the Nordschleife is for sportscars."

There's also four-way stops, which Google handled by just slowly rolling into the intersection. It's a very light aggression, but still.   There's a strong argument to be made to avoid marking or signifying a vehicle as autonomous, so that other drivers don't take advantage of the vehicle's polite nature.

It's also worthy to note that aggression is a tuneable setting, not a requirement. Production vehicles may well be more aggressive than current test vehicles, and it would be possible to have a vehicle get somewhat more aggressive the longer it sits in a situation as well. There is no inherent limitation keeping SDCs from being every bit as aggressive as a human, although programmers may well choose more passive tendencies."

It was then that I came to the realization that the government likely wont ever outlaw driving a car, but that's not to say that driving cars wont be phased out:  Driving is a privilege. We are permitted to operate vehicles by the government through the usage of drivers licences. What I believe will happen, and the method that will appease all of the ""you'll take driving from my cold dead hands"" people. is the cessation of granting NEW drivers licences.  Everyone that has a licence now and up to the point where they stop granting them can drive a manual operation car until they lose their licence or die. Once the licence is revoked, however, it can never be re-issued.   Because new licences are not being granted, and kids don't need a driver in the car to get from point A to point B, they will never feel the need or want to drive a car manually. It's akin to landline telephones: My parents refuse to go without one, but more people my age and younger don't care and wouldn't care if they were never available again."

SelfDrivingCars,393kcr,CallMeOatmeal,2,Tue Jun 9 03:44:24 2015 UTC,"Thing is, driving might be a ""privilege"" in the US but it's also incredibly important for the lives and livelihoods of so many people. The US is very rural in-between the densely populated coasts. r/SDC's wet dream of fleet ownership will not be practical out there. Cheap manual cars will likely stay the norm there for a much longer time, especially in areas where there simply are no marked roads and weather is incredibly rough for large parts of the year. Any attempt to limit manual driving will get a massive amount of pushback from a lot of people, including lots of business and politicians with vested interests. Which makes it rather unlikely to happen to any significant extend. And here in Germany people would probably win a lawsuit against the government, should it ever be attempted. Driving is a right here. (Everything is a right unless there is a specific reason to stop you from doing it and that reason ahs to hold up in constitutional court, which tends to side with the people over the government.)  I don't see how force can change anything. IMO it just won't work here and will jsut make it harder, because people digg their heels in. Look at guns legislations, that should be an even more obvious case for what we ought to do, yet in the US sepcial interests have stopped basically all progress... Just let people come to grips with their car being better at driving than them. Then they will let the car drive itself more and more and over time people will not want those ugly, large steering wheels in their cars. Car manufacturers will switch to a sidestick for a while, similar to what Airbus use in their cockpits. Only enthusiasts will buy cars with steering wheel, so only cars aimed at them will get one. Similar to how ever fewer cars have manual transmissions. Over the course of a few decades the market and fashion will achieve exactly what we want, without any pushback. Cars might have a fold-out sidestick and fold-out pedals for decades to come but nobody will use them outside of really weird special circumstances like having to drive a car through a hallway with mirrors on all surfaces."

You constantly hear/read about it in the ""tech"" news. Mercedes et.al. demonstrate that their cars can drive automatically to a high degree already, you just have to supevise sometimes. Adaptive cruise control and lane assist steer the car quite well on the average highway commute.  Uber, a hip ""tech"" startup that is massively over-hyped and over-funded, announce that they too will make and operate a fully automated taxi. Uber's business is based on an app, so the must be a tech company. And all tech startups are future multi-billion dollar companies.    For all of those who don't understand the massive difference in the underlying tech challenge, i.e. just about 99% of the world's population, there is no difference here. We have solved part of the problem so we must be close to the finish, right? Just look at how crazy uninformed journalists got when Tesla had them sit in a car with a prototype lane assist system."

What they found was that passengers prefer to be distracted as much as possible from the fact they are riding an elevator. Psycologically speaking, not being in control gives people the illusion that they are less safe, even though the contrary is true.

Vehicles that travel under 25 mph and are allowed on roads with posted speed limits of 35 mph are called low speed vehicles and are subject to less stringent safety regulation.   I believe this is the best approach Google could have took. You've got to be able to walk before you can run, and by doing this, there is much less likelihood that the cars will be involved in a fatal accident. We don't yet know if the 25 mph speed limit will remain once testing is complete, but I believe it will remain in the beginning. I believe the first implementation of self driving cars available for public use will be when Google opens up their Mountain View testing to the public, operating on a strictly limited network of roads at 25 mph.

Interstates will be where it begins since the economic benefits of avoiding crashes there will be the most obvious and semis will be excellent for training the cars. Other roads are secondary but eventual as they benefit from better intersections if you can assume all cars are automated. Off road you need a better interface for instructing the car where to go.

It would be too unpopular and too expensive to outlaw self driven vehicles when there are still many on the road.

The fight may get ugly, even if few care about driving anymore, especially if agitators stir up trouble painting it as a partisan ""freedom"" issue or something.

They don't need to conform to new safety or environmental regulations, so there seems to be a clear precedent for people being allowed to operate less save vehicles. Motorized vehicles fullfill more purposes than just transport from A to B, people will not want to give all of that up. You can use many different modes of transport in the public space, some of them don't even have an engine. E.g. horse-drawn carriages or bicycles. Unless you outlaw all of them, there is no point in going after manually driven cars specifically. Fully or even just partially automated cars will have to deal with other traffic participants that aren't automated at all. A high adoption rate of these safety systems alone will drop the accident rate by an incredible amount, much like vaccines can wipe out a disease even when not everyone can be vaccinated.  However there might be restrictions that would make it highly impractical to ""daily drive"" manually. Highways are an obvious example but there might also be restrictions on manual driving at night, in bad weather, in special zones with higher risk (e.g. in front of schools, on mountain roads, in the city center...) or during rush hour. I.e. in situations where accident rates are high and automated driving will have an undisputable impact on traffic deaths. Also, manually driven cars might be required to have a big flashing light on top of the roof to warn people or they will be limited to say 100 kph."

We Brits have a long history of automotive things, so let's keep it as a tourism thing, like with royalty and kings and queens, look at all the money that'll come in from driving tourists.  A robotaxi wouldn't be of any use in the UK, as one Mumsnet user stated ""We don't fucking need driverless taxis, they're a fucking joke, I'd rather have Bob the taxi driver anyway, at least a taxi driver's better.""  Over 500 people (IIRC, it was like 20,000+ people) complained about self driving cars on Facebook; on One Direction's official page, on Amy Childs' official page, a few groups about other things, and even the Mumsnet audience do not want it. Mumsnet users praise it publicly, but criticise it in private; although a private message about it did get published on the forums.  Even Harry Styles has come out as an anti-self driving cars person; he called them a bad idea. Same for Zayn Malki, who said they're only really suitable as a replacement for those machines old people ride on, but little else. Even Ant and Dec are against self driving cars, same for the likes of Little Mix (who said they only benefit ""oldies"" and no-one else needs them) and even the likes of people such as the cast of The Only Way Is Essex and Made In Chelsea.

You don't need taxis at all (although for some (the disabled, for example) they are highly desirable from a social point of view). A driverless taxi would (assuming a moderately free market) be cheaper than a human-driven one, so the question is not whether Bob is better but whether Bob is worth the price premium.   Over 500 people (IIRC, it was like 20,000+ people) complained about self driving cars on Facebook;   Did any of them have any reason for not wanting anyone else to have one, or did they just not want to have to buy a new car? The sensors are getting ever-cheaper, so I suspect in 40 years time it will be as hard to buy a non-SDC than it is to get one without power steering or air conditioning now.   Somewhere like Stoke-on-Trent, Hemel Hempstead, Wigan, Chelmsford or Croydon do not need self driving cars.   Croydon barely needs cars at all (and only really for those coming in form outer zones).   And this is true for the whole of the UK.

We're not the USA, and don't need the self driving car technology, we're smaller than them.

Letting a computer crawl through a traffic jam while you watch a film or sleep or whatever sounds far more appealing than doing it manually.1  1 That's actually the main problem with SDCs.

In a crash between a human-driven and robotic car, the robotic car will be able to provide data logs, video evidence, etc: the crash will be very likely the driver's fault, and the insurance company will very likely have to pay the other side's costs. So in the event of a crash, the downsides are much bigger.  Then there is the selection effect; people that prefer to drive themselves will be more likely to have more of the high risk factors - young, male, single, driving in the evening, bigger engine, less careful. After all, why would someone who cares enough to drive themselves have a boring car and drive really carefully, unless they are in the other high risk group: older drivers.   So instead of the general cost of collisions being spread amongst the random pairs of drivers in collisions (with a bias towards those who have no no-claims bonus), it is concentrated amongst a few increasingly selected high risk drivers.  Plus, higher traffic density..."
SelfDrivingCars,38rkbn,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:02:27 2015 UTC,"Insurance is all about the size of the downside.   Yes it is. So let's examine that using your own ideas.    If there is a crash between two insured human drivers, and they both claim it wasn't their fault, the insurance company is likely to have to pay, as legal battles are expensive and there is little evidence to go on.   OK. So let's make the assumption that 60% of all accidents are indeterminate who is to blame. The average American files an insurance claim for an accident once every 18 years.   Thus per 10,000 people insured you would expect 555 claims per year: 111 of which were your customers fault and you'd pay 100% of damages; 333 of which were indeterminate and you'd pay half of; and 111 of which were the other guy's fault and for which you'd pay 0%. That means you're paying for 277.5 accidents each year.   It's important to note that even if you could prove who's fault every accident was it makes no difference. You still have 555 wrecks, and now you're paying for half of them: The same exact 277.5 accidents per year. Whether you can determine who's to blame makes little to no difference in insurance.   Now let's assume half of cars on the road are autonomous, they reduce accidents by 90%, and for the sake of argument accidents are never their fault and their cameras and sensors can prove it.   Assuming human drivers are still just as likely to get in crashes with other human drivers, you can expect the rate of crashes between humans to be cut in half to 138.75 per thousand customers. Since we're assuming autonomous vehicles avoid 90% of accidents, we can expect 55.5 accidents (10% of the 555 above) with autonomous vehicles. As we've also presumed AVs will never be at fault, we can also presume the insurance company will have to pay for all of them.   So 138.75 plus 55.5 is 194.25, which is significantly lower than the 277.5 accidents they were paying for prior to the launch of autonomous vehicles. Less downside, which as you point out is what insurance is all about.    Then there is the selection effect; people that prefer to drive themselves will be more likely to have more of the high risk factors - young, male, single, driving in the evening, bigger engine, less careful.    Sure, possibly. So what? Young people and people with more powerful cars already pay dramatically more for insurance based on their risk. Looking at Geico.com an 18 year old with a Corvette would pay $176 per month; as a 42 year old I'd pay $36 for my Toyota Camry. They're every bit as profitable as other customers, potentially more so. I don't see the relevance."
SelfDrivingCars,38rkbn,NiceyChappe,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that the total number of crashes is lower, so it would seem that insurance would get cheaper if all else stays the same, but you make a few assumptions that I think make a difference.  Firstly, people do not randomly crash - that is why insurance is an order of magnitude different between a low risk and a high risk person. High risk people are more likely to crash at higher speed. A high risk person (A: boy racer, B:middle aged nutter) engages in riskier behaviour with regard to other human drivers - they race each other, or speed in urban areas. I don't think the number of those incidents per high risk driver would change significantly.  Secondly, when there is more proof, a much higher proportion of claims can go to trial - see a discussion of the effect of claims for things like whiplash on premiums here http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14590188.   Thirdly, the cost of risky behaviour is shared amongst those who the insurers cannot distinguish - premiums rose for women when gender discrimination was forbidden, because the insurers couldn't deselect the higher risk male drivers with punitive premiums. This would be the reverse, except that it is all the people who are low risk that are no longer driving by hand, so those who would share the cost have left.  Finally you assume the traffic conditions have not changed, but by the time there are enough autopiloted vehicles to change the risk statistics, they would have significantly increased the traffic density. One of the key benefits of fully automated vehicles is that they can be used as a cheap taxi service, and in models of that behaviour the traffic density increases as more journeys are made and the cars drive further to pick up passengers. Higher densities increase both the probability of a crash and the magnitude of the cost to the insurer enormously.   So I think the premiums for the shrinking pool of increasingly selected risky drivers in a scenario with each having a far higher chance of collision and where society increasingly sees driving by hand as a risky behaviour will see premiums only going up."
SelfDrivingCars,38rkbn,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think the number of those incidents per high risk driver would change significantly.   If the risk doesn't change, how on earth are you suggesting it would cause a rise in premiums?    Higher densities increase both the probability of a crash and the magnitude of the cost to the insurer enormously.   You can't have it both ways. If autonomous vehicles are going to share the road with manual drivers and have a dramatically lower risk of accidents they must by mathematical necessity lower the risk of accidents for manual vehicles as well.   One thing I think you mistakenly look at iis focusing only on high risk drivers who continue to drive. I think there will also be many high risk drivers that choose to remove themselves from the driving pool. The elderly, for example, are another high risk group that I can see adopting SDCs in very high numbers. Those with minor disabilities and other conditions with slightly impair their driving may also jump at the chance for safe, low costs alternatives to driving themselves. Likewise those who are prone to driving drunk, exhausted, or otherwise impaired may tend to utilize autonomous vehicles either when impaired or permanently.   It's impossible to predict exactly how all the factors combine, but I will be very surprised if insurance rates rise dramatically. I will say that to the extent those who aren't currently paying their fair share end up doing so.... good. I have no issue with that."

The other vehicle rolled through the stop sign and struck the right rear quarter panel and right rear wheel of the Google AV. Prior to the collision, the Google AV’s autonomous technology began applying the brakes in response to its detection of the other vehicle’s speed and trajectory. Just before the collision, the driver of the Google AV disengaged autonomous mode and took manual control of the vehicle in response to the application of the brakes by the Google AV’s autonomous technology. The Google AV was in manual mode. No injuries were reported at the scene. The Google AV sustained some damage.   Is it just me, or was braking not helpful in this situation? The location of the damage (rear quarter and rear wheel) implies that speeding up (or maybe just not braking) could have avoided the accident or could have at least softened the impact.."

However, if the whole fleet model everyone is predicting really starts to take off things could go much, much more quickly. Whole cities can potentially start selling their cars en masse in just a couple years. If the service and cost is competitive people will flock in droves. The idea of lumping maintenance, registration, gas, insurance, and car payment headaches into one reasonable monthly payment is an extremely powerful motivator.

But people want to own their cars for a variety of reasons and many people (especially in the US) are strictly against paying for any public transport. E.g. 4/10 people here in Germany already only take trips by car, even when better alternatives exist.   I haven't seen a single good argument for why this would change nor an outline for how it could realistically happen. Some people here just throw the claim that it will undisputably happen around without anything concrete to back it up, while decades worth of studies by actual scientists indicate the opposite. We have had the technology to reduce car ownership by 90% and massively reduce fuel use, traffic deaths etc., while saving huge sums of money, for decades. We call it ""busses"" and ""trains"". But people by and large want to own and operate their own personal vehicle. Think about how making driving even more comfortable and commuting less of a waste is going to affect that.

We seem to have some agreement at this point that commercially ready self driving cars are 5 years out, at a minimum. Assuming that happens I believe we'll see relatively slow adoption the first couple of years for a few reasons: Caution of being an early adopter; supply issues; and/or cost. After that we may well see much more aggressive adoption, but I still think we're looking at a 30 year or so rollout to replace (nearly) all cars on the road due to the fact cars are expensive and last a long time and not everybody is going to immediately jump on the bandwagon.

Maybe by 2025 in the US you hit 50% of cars sold are SDCs.  That would still put you into the 2030s for 50% all registered cars.  So I would guess around 20 years for the US.

I didn't wait for it to wear out before retiring it. I don't envision a great deal of people waiting for their cars to wear out before using autonomous taxis either. The SUV in the driveway may find itself relegated to grocery shopping and weekend escapades as taxis become cheaper and more practical for basic mobility such as commuting.  Estimates vary, but we won't need nearly as many AVs to meet current demand for mobility with cars. Somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd the current number of vehicles will be needed to move people around. AVs of course will be workhorses that cover 10 times as many miles per day, and themselves may only have an operational lifespan of a few years. They will also be simpler to manufacture, with less materials and less moving parts than an internal combustion engine vehicle.   Another thing to keep in mind is that the law of accelerating returns applies to far more than just mobility. As we  approach 2030 and beyond, rapid technological unemployment will be underway and this will cause some pretty serious economic/social disruption across the board- who knows exactly how this will affect our lifestyles, pocketbooks, and mobility habits going into the future.

The simple fact here that cars are moving at different speeds is not indicative of how an intelligent comprehensive autonomous traffic system would or should function. The need to continue forward momentum unencumbered is largely a function of the active driver. Once that driver becomes a passenger, traffic can move in unison at a uniform speed and allow for pedestrian right-of way.  Aside from failing to account for cyclists and pedestrians, it also fails to account for hardware or software malfunction and increases the likelihood of collision if vehicles are crossing paths at this kind of speed.   I for one would not want any intersection to function this way, whether or not it was possible or might shave 60 seconds off a commute."

You can't turn left or go forward. The system in the video shows the cars making really specific movements that make collision way less likely than if a person was driving. They can make quick decisions in the middle of a super busy intersection and find a path through it, whereas if it were a human driver, it would be dangerous to stroll out in a busy intersection because there are too many things happening at once. The system doesn't make the cars go faster, but it reduces waiting time at intersections. You can go at the smallest fraction of a gap without having to clear the intersection."

People who grew up with no car crashes might be totally ok with cars flying past them at full speed.  Still, I agree with the article. Failing to account for pedestrians is a dealbreaker.

Give back the streets to the people as much as possible. AVs can be controlled to the point that they will allow us to do this.

If we can eliminate the need for street parking, we open up even very old, dense cities to more choices and increased safety.

That's hardly the most difficult part of the problem.  There are already buttons at crosswalks that pedestrians can push when they want to cross the street.  It would not be difficult to adjust the speed of every car on the road, or even bring them all to a stop, when a pedestrian wants to cross.  Considering that autonomous cars are going to have to have pedestrian avoidance anyway, there's really not even any need for a button.  The first car that sees a person standing on the side of the road can signal back down the line that there is a pedestrian about to cross and all the cars can adjust their speed downwards accordingly to give the pedestrian ample time to cross the road."

If you're talking about current day and over the next decades until all cars on the road are autonomous--and I suspect you are based on the need to manually operate the vehicle in certain circumstances--then definitely from a practical standpoint.  A car with no lights can be extremely dangerous for manual drivers on the same highway for obvious reasons.  Technically the SDC wouldn't necessarily need the lights, but legally and otherwise it would.  If you're talking about in the future, then no, they wouldn't necessarily need headlights.  That said, standard camera vision will become more and more useful as machine ""intelligence"" improves and may be used as either a redundant or even primary sensor for the vehicle (as it already is in some cases)."
SelfDrivingCars,38mipt,madcuzimflagrant,3,Fri Jun 5 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"Light helps with cameras. LIDARs are very useful for obstacle detection and for localization, but seeing texture is better with cameras. To be fair LIDARs also send out light, just not visible light and for a very short time period.   Imo it seems likely that a full self driving car will rely on many sensors and some of those might perform better with light in many situations. They also notify animals, bicycles and walking humans that a vehicle is approaching which might be useful.   Also having a source of light can be practical in some stationary situations."

In most jurisdictions we pay for road maintenance through taxes, mostly general taxes. The two things that destroy the roads are weather and high axle loads from trucks. A heavy truck does a thousand times the damage to a road than a typical car.  So by reducing truck axle loads to the 'sweet spot' that balances road damage against the cost of trucking, then the road service is delivered at the lowest overall cost to the public.  That will be the way to pass the biggest savings in freight/road costs to the consumer. Autonomous trucks give us the perfect opportunity to implement this new balance.  Will it happen?..."

Thus the financial calculation becomes much more obviously in favour of long distance SDCs. To me the endgame of the SDC will be a glorified lazyboy chair on wheels. Basically the least amount of structure to keep the weather out and the one or two passengers in comfort.   Long, narrow, electric, and bullet shaped it will be cheap to make and cheap to run. Also there can be sacrifices that aren't available to motorcycles such as really durable tires. Thus the cost per mile could end up being in the ballpark of 10 cents.

The train needs a crew, maintenance team, and dispatchers. Then once the train gets to its location you still need a truck to pick it up and the train might not go the best way possible or have a loading area close to the destination. We also have to look into the TMPG because the MPG goes down with every ton. Also TMPG isn't exactly the same as MPG.  A semi normally hauls 19-26 tons so that lowers the efficiency and that is just one trailer a train normally has 3000 tons on it. If you want to read more about TMPG check this out.

The reason is that most companies aren't on rail lines and neither is their product's final destination. The most efficient use of rail is basically as a long haul conveyor from coal mines to power plants. But for passenger travel, rail by definition can only move people from one fixed point to another fixed point. That leaves out how everybody gets to and from those fixed points.

In what world isn't it preferable for all of us to have separate vehicles that take us to our own custom destinations?

But the technological obstacles are pretty much the same for all developers, and so if Google fail - they will likely fail ahead of the pack and have move onto something more promising already. I still have them firmly in first place - and the lead is theirs to lose.  The NHTSA Level 3 is a case in point - Google knew in 2013 that the fatal flaw is the driver - they simply cannot be relied upon to re-engage and take control when needed. So they determined that NHTSA Level 4 was the only practical solution - no matter how hard it is to achieve that.  Whereas what are the automakers doing? - plowing on towards NHTSA Level 3 as a 'stepping stone' to Level 4. Yet the secret sauce needed for Level 4 is really not a simple extension of Level 3."

The fact that these others are generally very smart people makes me stop and think more about these issues. This is not an exhaustive list:   the driving task in an urban environment is way too complex for an AV to ever cope whilst human drivers are still on the road - there are just too many complex and edge cases for AVs to be safe AVs cannot cope with emergency situations and will always need a qualified driver onboard to take over when necessary. This dramatically reduces the potential benefits that AVs are purported to offer.   Weather - if AVs can't operate when human drivers can, then they will only ever be a partial solution. LiDAR isn't the right solution to allow safe driving as it can't cope with adverse weather, and machine vision isn't advanced enough either.    If the author is trying to demonstrate that Uber could overtake Google then that would require Uber to put in an awful lot of testing miles on public roads from a larger vehicle fleet than Google. Until that looks like it is starting to happen, then Google remain clear AV developer leaders based on information in the public domain."

They drive grandma-style because they prefer to err on the cautious side and because a single accident would be a PR nightmare.    AVs cannot cope with emergency situations and will always need a qualified driver onboard to take over when necessary.    Give examples. I am pretty sure that they have a lot of recorded emergency situations in their database by now and their algorithm is trained on all those. Likely the algorithm have more emergency training than most humans.    Weather - if AVs can't operate when human drivers can, then they will only ever be a partial solution.    This is an issue in some areas. But they don't need to drive everywhere at first. Also I am very confident they will learn how to drive on snow, I developed a LIDAR localization algorithm which handles a few decimeters of snow, I doubt that google's solution is much worse than mine. They start solving driving in nice weather because thats how you approach a problem, once that is solved you expand the solution less ideal situations.    LiDAR isn't the right solution to allow safe driving as it can't cope with adverse weather, and machine vision isn't advanced enough either.   LIDAR is pretty ideal for adverse weather imo. Sure the mechanical Velodyne might not be ideal for Siberia, but Darpa SWEEPER might fix this. Removing rain from images is done pretty well with CNNs today.   I see a lot of other challenges for Google, going into the car business isn't easy. And the competitors are plenty and might catch up fast. Still their advantage today is pretty large..."
SelfDrivingCars,38547l,heltok,2,Tue Jun 2 07:37:13 2015 UTC,"It's not clear at all to me that Google can handle driving at speeds in dynamic environments above 30 mi/hr. Current LIDAR can only identify something at around 70 meters away, correct? That's basically your stopping distance at 60 mi/hr, so you have to rely on longer-range sensors like radar and cameras which are not as good. Something like a loaded tractor trailer is that much more difficult. It's also not clear how often their test drivers are taking over. Sometimes Google says it's once every 50,000 miles, but then they'll give a test ride to a reporter and they have to take over twice. It was conservative, certainly, but stopping in the middle of the road is dangerous as well. Hopefully they'll get there. Under 30 mph on low-speed roads as they're doing now, that seems reachable to me.  An emergency situation would be maybe a sensor failure on a freeway or during a turn. Or just the right combination of glare or debris at the right time, something that a human would have no problem with. If the vehicle is unable to get itself to safety, that's a big problem.   Kind of a side note, but I think a lot about two-lane rural roads. There's a lot of times when the vehicle coming towards you starts to drift into your lane. You have to ignore it and trust them to move back, or else you'd be driving in the shoulder half the time. An SDC will have to find that balance of risk vs. reward that seems reasonable to passengers. It may be safer than a passenger's response would have been, but if it feels to early or too late, that could be a problem. I'm getting way off topic.  Is CNN a convolutional neural network? Can you give a source for removing rain from images in real-time? I'm legitimately curious. My understanding is that the weather issue was more about falling rain than snow on the ground.   I agree Google has an advantage, both in intellectual property and on-road testing. But doesn't it feel like they're not investing enough, given the potential? If Uber were to start poaching Google's engineers, putting hundreds of test cars out on the roads, it seems they could catch up quickly. That is, if they can convince their investors that this is a good move."

So Google isn't in the lead, they are currently not even on the board, while the car manufacturers are racking up ever higher scores. Trust is a very important element of traffic. People will need to see it demonstrated again and again that automatic driving is safe befre they trust their lifes and the lifes of their children to it.  Google is making headlines currently but the manufacturers have decades worth of goodwill and are advancing rapidly behind closed doors. (And in unmarked vehicles that nobody on the road will recognise as a research prototype.) The likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes will sell highly automated cars in a couple of years that will be able to do 99% of what their owners would want them to do, while Google will run a glorified taxi cab service that is limited to California and good weather. Though granted, bad weather is almost never a concern in California. And that's assuming that Google can even get their system small, light and cheap enough for mass production. An ability they have not yet demonstrated. Just as they haven't demonstrated the ability to mass produce their Google bug cars to the same degree of quality and with the same efficiency as established manufacturers.   And what will happen once Car2X has progressed sufficiently to let cars communicate and organise? Do you think the standardisation bodies the car manufacturers and their suppliers are members of will choose Google's approach over the manufacturer's? Will the majority of people give up their own vehicle and rely on Google's service alone? Will it even be legal outside a few US states for the foreseeable future? In standards/formats wars, the ""best"" system often doesn't come out on top.   All those points above assume that Google's technical approach of throwing massive sensors and massive amounts of compute power at the problem is the correct one or at least is as good as the car manufacturer's approach of using lots of relatively cheap sensors and an assembly of relatively simple functions into complex behaviour. I disagree with that notion. The manufacturer's approach is much more practical, in fact many cars come with the necessary hardware today. Almost all of those simple functions are implemented and they are working hard on the complex behaviour. Once that is finished, most of which should be done over the next 5-10 years, they are basically done and r&d can focus on handling traffic as a whole as a multi-car system. Google has a lead on the complex behaviour but their system is incredibly hampered by the limited environment it can be used in and the highly specialised hardware it requires. It's going to take a lot of work to make it practical for everyday use across the globe.   Well, I guess we will see how it will play out. I wexpect to see both Google and the car manufacturers having lots of cars using their respective approaches on the road in a decade. But the way it seems to be going right now, the manufacturers will have the suppliers, the law, the majority of the customers and pure economics on their side for decades to come."
SelfDrivingCars,38547l,walky22talky,3,Tue Jun 2 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"partially automated systems are ""wins"" already.    I'm not sure about this. I guess it will be dependent on whether they figure out a good way to transition from car back to human. If they don't, then there will be a number of accidents/lawsuits which will probably set back the release of SDCs (and maybe current auto manufactures wouldn't mind this).    while Google will run a glorified taxi cab service that is limited to California and good weather   It won't be limited to California. They could very easily transition this to other urban environments and only operate them during good weather. That still would probably take care of 50% of the population around 90% of the year (guesstimate of 50% of people living in urban environments and only weather issues 10% of the year). They could very quickly map any new territory and then release the cars which would continually map the area. I do think they'll figure out the weather relatively quickly after their initial release is successful.   In the end I just don't think that the auto manufacturers have the data science understanding to develop the software, and google doesn't have the experience in manufacturing. If google is still ahead of all others in terms of the software, then it will come down to either google partnering/licensing their tech to just a single automaker (who then gets the advantage), or google just outright buys an automaker for the manufacturing expertise. The suppliers will move to any company that is still buying their parts.

Google and Uber will partner with small manufacturers that don't have SDV technology of their own to build vehicles for them. Instead of selling the cars Google and Uber will act as fleet owners and managers selling time in the vehicles for travel. There will be no option for manual drive, only an emergency stop and a get me out of here button after the first few SDV carjackings.  Meanwhile, the traditional manufacturers will be selling cars like they do now but with a new optional SDV system that costs a ridiculous amount of money. There will be no fleet management capabilities because the manufacturers want everybody to buy a car. Few people will choose the optional SDV capabilities due to the rediculous cost.  As fleet managers roll out more cars in more markets, personal vehicle usage will drop. People will start selling their personal vehicles and use fleet managed SDVs exclusively. Traditional manufacturers will keep rolling out their SDV optional vehicles, and because nobody wants to pay their ridiculous prices they'll assume nobody wants it.  As personal vehicle sales plummet the traditional manufacturers will suddenly realize they screwed up. With no hope of implementing the same features as the fleet managers they will lobby governments to put ridiculous rules into place to make fleet management illegal. Most likely they'll demand all SDVs have manual controls, and only the owner is allowed to sit in the driver's seat."

In fact, once we hit a threshold of SDCs on the road we could have them identify illegal driving by the remaining human drivers and send sensor data to the police who could then issue a ticket with no cops involved.   Profesional drivers--cab drivers would disappear. Truck drivers and delivery people might last a little longer just to monitor the cargo (trucks can carry millions of dollars of cargo in one load) and deal with pickups and deliveries.  Free time, productivity and creativity--hundreds of millions of people would gain minutes or even hours of free time every day. Imagine what could be done with something like 1/2 billion man hours freed up every day for entertainment and creative pursuits.  Increased travel for entertainment--I live less than 1 hour from two major US cities, but I don't drive into either city as often as I want to because it's a pain in the ass to drive and park. Eliminating the stress and aggravation of driving would make a Saturday on the town a lot more enjoyable and accessible.  Mass transit--mass transit would probably suffer in most US cities--the subways, trains and bus systems certainly lose some of their competitive advantage when you don't have to drive and park. If SDC services become cheap enough, mass transit dies.  New industries--drivers will go away, but there will be new jobs created in the software and entertainment industry.

They are realizing that their business model is easily replicable and that eventually they'll have to manufacture cars in order to remain relevant throughout the next decade. It's just that they seem to be pissing people off all over the place along the way.   Given that it took Tesla 8 years to mass produce their first in-house model, I'd assume Uber is at least 5 years (being generous) away from building theirs. But I'm not sure that's enough time to get through the regulations necessary to manufacture cars and get them on the roads all over America.  This is really Uber's only play, but GM or Toyota or even Enterprise or Hertz can pretty easily hop into the pay per hour SDC market without much effort. And now instead of leveraging their relationship with Carnegie Mellon, they have instead emptied out their program in its growing stages. This will likely stunt the growth of the group's research and leave Uber with an inferior product. By all accounts, University of Michigan was ahead of Carnegie on their SDC tech, so it's not even clear that Uber picked the right school.   Uber is making enemies in government, the auto industry, and now in education. It'll be interesting to see how they grow in comparison to other companies like GM or Google or car rental companies."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,UnderdogIS,8,Mon Jun 1 00:57:51 2015 UTC,Producing a car isn't the hard part. There are companies that do that that Uber can outsource the production to. It's the R&D of the self driving vehicle that is really the key.
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,sweetmoses,0,Mon Jun 1 03:56:49 2015 UTC,"Yes producing a car is absolutely the hard part. There are only a handful of companies that actually manufacture automobiles, not because it's not a lucrative industry, but because the mechanical and regulatory barriers to entry are immense. And all of them are working on SDC technology, and eventually the technological problems will be figured out with or without Uber. So there's no reason for any of the current manufacturers to outsource production for Uber as opposed to just selling them a fleet, so Uber has chosen to manufacture cars on their own. I don't know who you think has the ability to produce cars other than the current huge auto manufacturers that now see Uber as a competitor."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,spadmin,2,Mon Jun 1 04:23:20 2015 UTC,A lot of companies including the large ones like ford and toyota outsource the production of cars with the technology to build the cars. Of course it will require retooling but that is minor. It's all in the R&D of the self driving car.
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,sweetmoses,-3,Mon Jun 1 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"No, they don't outsource production. They outsource the manufacture of components to several companies. But every car company assembles their own vehicles and has to deal with DoT regulations by themselves. Uber doesn't have the capability to do either and it's not such an easy thing to do. It's way more than retooling. They have to build assembly plants, pass crash tests, pass emissions tests, and house and service their vehicles in every city in America. They're a super long way away from doing that. The technology itself will eventually be figured out, no matter what. And nobody needs Uber to figure it out, except Uber of course. Uber just doesn't want to be beholden to a particular auto manufacturer, which makes sense, but they are so far away from producing an actual car, let alone figuring out SDC, that I doubt the majors are worried about them. It's not hard for GM or Enterprise to make an app that wipes out Uber if they already have the SDC vehicles."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,michelework,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:28:29 2015 UTC,If they produce it off a production model... Let's take for instance the latest GMC Yukon... They could then create procedure for formal fitting process. It may not even be pretty but at long as it works perfect who cares.  I think there transportation model will run much like enterprise car rental... They don't build the cars they just provide the service
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,sweetmoses,2,Mon Jun 1 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"That's fine, but then they still have to buy the Yukon from GMC. And in that instance, GMC is in a better position to offer a SDC Yukon taxi service than Uber.   I don't think Uber has that unique of a service. They don't own anything currently besides some code and an idea that other established companies can replicate. At least Enterprise owns the vehicles and lots of real estate at airports and throughout cities to provide cars to lots of people. Uber doesn't have any of this, which is why they need to build their own car. I'm just skeptical that they can pull it off."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,madcuzimflagrant,2,Mon Jun 1 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"Uber is fundamentally an app. There is not much effort to duplicate. Google already has a high understanding of the commute habits of all its users. Once the technology is ready, google releases its own app  and users can summon a car from their own phone. Google could even make the app part of their smart phone OS."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,sweetmoses,2,Mon Jun 1 14:31:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, Google is also in a better position to be a player in this market. They also have a higher propensity to actually work with other companies and could probably broker a deal to get their cars into all of the Enterprise locations in the country. Uber seems to want to go it alone, and that's just not a good strategy."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,madcuzimflagrant,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"Do you work for enterprise?  Almost every one of your posts is hyping them?  For the record, I agree with you for the most part about Uber's vulnerability, but I fail to see how Enterprise has that big of an advantage comparatively.  Enterprise having great locations at airports, etc. is not really important if you're just ordering a ride up on your phone because SDCs wouldn't need to park that close to their operating area.  They have a small advantage in that they have a place to park them at all, and that they already have a system for maintenance, etc. already set up, but I don't see it as any real barrier for companies like Google or Uber.  Uber may pull something off with their CM talent, but I doubt they'll be first to the line, which means Enterprise and Uber are really on fairly equal footing.  Either a manufacturer is selling to both of them, or they both are in trouble.  The only non-auto companies that I really see making it work are Google and Apple--and I only mention the latter because they are sitting on so much cash that if they really did want to go into SDC research and vehicle production they have the means to make it happen.  That said, Google all the way.  They seem to have a significant lead on everyone researching SDCs.  I suspect eventually they will partner with one or more auto manufacturers or simply do a licensing deal with them.  However, if they wanted to they definitely have the ability to produce their own vehicles.  They already are working with the major parts suppliers and are having their tiny test fleet built by Roush.  If they wanted to go into major production on their own they have access to the best in robotics and have the resources to build their own facilities.  It wouldn't happen overnight, but I think they could pull it off before big auto caught up.  Google also has a major advantage with their mapping technologies and reach with android that the manufacturers don't.  Manufacturing certainly has major barriers to entry, but Tesla has already shattered the idea that it can't be done.  And while it is a significant component for future success, there are other competencies that are equally important that manufacturers don't have.  They also don't seem to have the desire for fully-autonomous vehicles as most have been reluctantly pulled into the competition and many still only have partial systems in their projections.  Nor do they seem to have the desire to get involved directly in any form of taxi or rental services."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,cavehobbit,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"No, I don't work for Enterprise, I just use them as a placeholder for every rental company. I think their huge advantage is real estate and customer habit. They're already in every airport in America and a lot of them are already in the practice of picking up their customers. At first, the majority of people won't be ordering SDCs for local transit. It'll be travelers renting SDCs to get around cities they're unfamiliar with. I think it's a much lower hurdle to get an Enterprise customer to rent an SDC than it is to convince people who don't use Uber to use Uber. They also have experience with fleet management and maintenance, which is something Uber has none of. Uber has to park their cars somewhere, meaning they need actual parking lots. I know it's not technologically difficult to pave a parking lot and paint stripes on it, but it is logistically difficult to purchase enough real estate in enough strategic locations to compete with cab companies and rental car companies.   I agree Google has the early advantage over Apple in the SDC market. But I think Apple is aiming at Mercedes-Benz and BMW instead of Google. They don't really need to invent the technology like Google does, they just need to perfect the design experience of the car itself. But Google will have way more licensing opportunities and likely have their technology in more vehicles than Apple.   Tesla has proven that entering the auto manufacturing market is possible, but they have also proven how difficult it is and how long it really takes. They worked with Lotus for 8 years and basically just made a battery for a car that was already produced by someone else. Then their first production model took 2 years longer than they planned and that was with a half billion dollar loan from the Department of Energy. So yeah, they did it, but it was terribly difficult. And Uber has a horrible track record with government regulators, so I imagine they'll have a difficult time too."

That's a great point.  There will definitely be a demand for different ride experiences and luxury will certainly have a lot of room to evolve in both ownership and fleet models."
SelfDrivingCars,38026a,sweetmoses,5,Sun Jun 7 05:51:24 2015 UTC,"Uber has a head start on the software, which is a huge advantage. They could blow it though, as software is not difficult to recreate.  But they are also the biggest early player in the market, and have been accumulation volume and market data for years now. there nearest competitor is Lyft, who is not close in ridership."

It's inevitable that people will be more aggressive in a car, just like on the internet. Not excusing this behavior, just saying it's expected given human nature.

SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,BeriAlpha,6,Mon Jun 1 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think the point being made is that assholery is not a binary state that some people are and others are not. Assholery is bad behavior, not a permanent state of being. Yes, repeated asshole behavior may lead to a reputation as an asshole, but when we refer to specific people as ""assholes"" we're referencing their chronic bad behavior, not some higher state of being.  There are stressful situations (like driving in traffic) that result in chemical responses that alter our attitudes. These attitude changes can elicit behavior we wouldn't exhibit under normal circumstances. Some people are better at resisting their emotions, some people respond more severely to these stressful situations than others, some people have tactics to identify and avoid scenarios that will be stressful.   /u/PersonOfInternets isn't saying that these involuntary chemical changes are justification for bad behavior; the assertion is that most people experience this emotional/chemical effect under stress and that sometimes their behavior isn't consistent with their normal, non-stressed behavior. Emotions affect us all, everyone has over-reacted at one point in their lives, and that doesn't make them an asshole permanently."

It's impossible to disagree with. You can attack the premises, by arguing that acting like an asshole in a car does not, in fact, make you an asshole, but you can't (by the rules of logic) disagree with a tautological statement.  What I'm trying to get at is, you keep skating around your point, and I keep trying to push you to actually make a statement. So let me help you, and tone down the language a bit while doing so.  Let's imagine a person who spends 100% of their day driving a car. While driving a car, 100% of the time, they act aggressively. Are they an aggressive person?  If you'd agree with that, then you're agreeing with the statement that your actions in a car can represent your overall self.  Now then, you've made the statement that it is possible to drive a car some percentage less than 100%, and act aggressively some percentage less than 100%, and not be an aggressive person.  So you need to make an actual position statement. What is an example of a percentage that forgives someone for aggression behind the wheel? How many times a week can a person cut off another driver, brake-check another car, roar through a changing yellow light, refuse to open space for lane changes, and so on, before it reflects badly on them as a whole? Does it matter if they cause an accident? Does it matter if they kill someone?  Lay it out for me. Because I've made my position quite clear."

SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,dugmartsch,12,Mon Jun 8 20:34:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the report. That's pretty much what I'd expect, although I expect to see them get a little more normal/aggressive over time.  I also think that in order to have an optimally working whole system, person-driven cars would be banned from many/most roads. I'm not sure what to think about that either since I'm also into cars and driving. I guess maybe there could be designated roads for drivers. I think any such ban will take a long time to happen though, and self-driving cars will first have to live alongside driven cars."
SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,stevep98,12,Mon Jun 1 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"Non-autonomous cars will never be banned.  Not outright.  Driving licencing requirements will grow more and more onerous, until it may reach a create a de facto ban, but there will never be a law saying it's illegal to drive your car.    Getting a driver's license in America is about as difficult as getting a dog license, so some improvement there is welcome.  You get your dog a new license every year, but you never take another driving test again in your entire life.  Right now when you take away someone's DL you take away their livelihood and basically guarantee the they'll be on government assistance.  SDCs create a plausible alternative.  That will finally allow government to get the worst drivers off the road and make the streets much safer for all of us."

Actually that's happening to become reality to an ever higher degree. Currently there is ""pre crash"", ""city brake"" or even older technology like ABS and ESP which can help avoid many crashes. Many german cars can be bought with (currently still optional) systems that make crashing or running someone over below 30 kph practically impossible. These systems will only get better and in the near future we will have cars that will avoid all avoidable crashes and hopefully warn the driver sufficiently when engaging in risky behaviour so as to reduce unavoidable crashes for others to a minimum."

SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,MattRix,4,Sun May 31 06:29:14 2015 UTC,"Talk about a surveillance society.    Thing is, traffic happens on public roads. Do you have an expectation of privacy in public? There are so many CCTV cameras out there and your phone is broadcasting all of your movements. As soon as you are in public you are under constant surveillance. So while I agree that constant video survaillance of say people's homes or keeping complete record of phone metadata is heinous, I see everyone basically having a dashcam that automatically uploads all legally relevant footage as a totally different thing. With the correct limitations it can be acceptable. Obviously the camera should not transmit anything but what is necessary to investigate the crime and it should not leak any personal information of the owner. We would also have to find a way to authenticate the footage to make it difficult to fake. (I do realise it's going to be difficult or even impossible to build real systems that manage to conform to these requirements.)  Most accidents with injuries or fatalities are caused by one or both parties having broken at least one rule. E.g. DUI, speeding, running a red light or cutting someone off. People should follow the fucking rules while they participate in traffic but they don't, so IMO if we can help enforcement of the rules in a practical way it's a good thing. Freedom means you can drive wherever you want, not break any law you want."
SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,CoolGuy54,3,Sun May 31 00:09:09 2015 UTC,"automatically uploads all legally relevant footage   Sure, this is fine, if we have a tight and rigorous definition of what ""legally relevant"" means. That part is crucial, and it isn't automatic that it would be done right."
SelfDrivingCars,37w06p,skgoa,2,Sun May 31 01:32:14 2015 UTC,"That's a scary thought though... you could catch anyone breaking any traffic rule at all (rolling through stop signs, running red lights, even speeding)... but at that point why not use the sensors & cameras to spot ANY crime? Cars go past a kidnapping/bank-robbery/jaywalking and ID the suspects, etc. You'd basically have video coverage of any area within 20m of a road."

Consider a cyclist that is going well below the speed limit and is driving on the right portion of the lane of a two lane road (one lane each way). You might be able to get by while staying in your lane, but it would be close. Also presume no car is coming in the opposite lane.   Now most humans would pull partway into the incoming lane and pass the cyclist. Will a self driving car do this (leave the lane, e.g., cross the double yellow lines)? If not, will it just slow down ATL the cyclists speed and follow a safe distance behind?  That's what I presume, but, damn, that will be annoying and potentially dangerous while there are still human drivers on the roads who will get quickly annoyed when caught behind a self driving car (or two or three) in this situation."

SelfDrivingCars,37vhwc,PaulGodsmark,1 point,Sat May 30 19:11:59 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but beyond not banning them there is little to do to prepare. At this point it is so up in the air as to when, how, who, etc that any preparations would just be money thrown away.   My guess is that by preparations they mean to just throw money at friends who will do expensive studies that will quickly be run over by reality.  There are about as many opinions as there are experts. There are those who say that people will resist driverless cars, those who say that the final ""perfection"" is impossible and thus they will never actually be safer, those who predict that they will be all the rage in 5 years, those who predict 25, there are those who say it will decimate private ownership, and those who say that everyone will be able to afford super cheap automatic cars.  I mean we haven't even fully nailed down the terminology. Automatic and manual are sort of already taken in the car world.   Then there is the simple fact that even as self driving cars come into popular usage there will be generation after generation until the formula is somewhat discovered and perfected. My favourite analogy would be cellphones prior to the first iPhone. There were so many different fundamental shapes and designs until the iPhone came along and now we have one major design and a few specialist ones. I suspect that the same thing will happen with SDCs; there will be a bunch of very different, well thought out designs that are very logical, then there will be a few breakthrough designs (think motorola razr) that everyone will follow. Then there will be the iPhone design breakthrough which will probably rule for quite some time.  Then there will be the whole banning manually driven cars debate.   And on top of that there will be rejigs of the whole model of car ownership that will go through many iterations until it settles down.  So about the only thing that any government should be doing at this point is not getting in the way. So if some collection of business people show up in government lobbying to not do something it will be exactly at that point that government will know exactly what is happening next and would be fools to give in to the lobbyists."
SelfDrivingCars,37vhwc,EmperorOfCanada,2,Sat May 30 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"So about the only thing that any government should be doing at this point is not getting in the way.   I will have to disagree with you on this one. Here's just one reason why (there are others): prudent planning.  In the report that I co-authored we recommended that all major infrastructure projects have an autonomous vehicle (AV) audit to determine how robust the operational and business case will be. In other words, introduce AVs as a risk item and then plan for it as you would any other risk.  So if the authorities find, as you suggest, that this AV talk is all too vague and ethereal and of little relevance now, then great, carry on and commit billions of dollars to infrastructure that will likely be operating when AVs become mainstream. At least they will have done their due diligence and have a paper trail to support their decision on AVs and the project risks presented. Using the best information available at the time they will have reached a reasoned decision, and not ignored a major emerging trend.  Or, the authorities might do this due diligence and go - 'Wow! our plans are really susceptible to disruption and we need to take more care of the tax-payer's money to ensure it is spend wisely.'  'That downtown car park we were about to build might only have useful life of 10 years, not the 40 we had planned - maybe we should have a look at our plans and see if we can future-proof it in some way?'. Or, 'That transit project that we are promoting that might be finished being built in 2025 - we now see that our ridership could have significantly disappeared to ride-sharing AVs - maybe we should do a more detailed study before committing billions to this project?'.  Its the public tax dollars at stake - I think sensible due diligence is the right course of action."
SelfDrivingCars,37vhwc,EmperorOfCanada,1 point,Sun May 31 00:49:29 2015 UTC,"I was doing work for a major phone company when they deployed DSL. They had this system where you could rent software such as Microsoft Office and whatnot via some Novell system.  The data capacity was around 1mbit which blew dialup clean out of the water. In our discussions we all wanted to sign up because we wanted this other little feature of being able to connect to the internet. A feature that some local professors had written a report saying that no existing benefit existed for customers to go beyond dialup speeds. The phone company nearly pulled that stupid internet feature except for us ""non-experts"" the people who ran web-servers, made billing systems, and generally were soaked in this environment every day. The only way that this succeeded was that the demand existed that day and that the project was very short term. They bought the equipment and had it deployed in month or so. Also this particular ""feature"" could be turned on or off at no cost so was zero risk. Seeing that I was in charge of making the billing system work I saw around one person in 10,000 use their stupid Novell software rental system whereas 100% of customers used substantial amounts of data. The phone company turned on a dime, dropped their Novell crap (at huge cost) and immediately began advertising how large a multiple in speed their service was over dial-up. Luckily for the phone company they didn't have to make commitments to their ""experts"".  So I have exactly zero interest in citizen money being wasted on any academics writing opinion pieces that don't have a snowball's chance in hell of even being vaguely correct.  Mr Bell thought that every large city would have at least one phone line. Watson on the number of computers. Gates on the size of memory. These are just a few examples of many many genuine experts who simply couldn't envision the transformative nature of their technologies.   So why would some two bit blowhards from some backroom offices in some dark corner of government have a fucking clue as to what is about to happen?  Here are some simple question that nobody seems to agree on. Will the number of cars rise due to driverless cars or go down?  Will private ownership go up or go down?  Find me an expert from say 1995 who could have seen the onslaught that is texting?  What year will the first blind person legally drive a car in Canada?  What year will driverless cars outnumber manual ones?  To even make claims about driverless technology is reckless in that people might act upon it."

Even if the car never requests a human to, some jackass will see something and think he knows better than the car (which has already seen the obstacle and panned to avoid it accordingly) and will grab the wheel and serve right into another vehicle he didn't see making the whole situation worse.

I live in one of the highest deer (over)population areas in the US so I have no doubt that short of some very advanced technology that is not available currently there will be accidents involving SDCs and deer, but I would be very surprised if they can't do better."

SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,krelin,6,Thu May 28 10:34:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, an SDC should have an extremely high likelihood of avoiding a deer collision due to the fact that they would be a large/easily detectable potential obstacle, with a relatively predictable movement vector (especially running at top speed). These factors should make it very easy for the vehicle to calculate and react. Deer should be much easier to manage/mitigate, in fact, than other vehicles driven by humans."
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,skgoa,2,Thu May 28 17:35:38 2015 UTC,Yes. Human drivers can also avoid deer somewhat easily when equiped with night vision and/or infrared cameras that highlight the deer. Premium cars like BMW or Mercedes have this technology already.
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,trentsgir,2,Tue Jun 2 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"While I argued that pedestrian collision avoidance systems won't work well for deer in another comment, I think you're right.  A SDC wouldn't necessarily have to come to a full stop to avoid a collision.  It could simply swerve out of the deer's path.  That kind of predictive analysis of movement is something humans are pretty bad at, but SDCs well be able to do the calculations and analysis very quickly."
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,cbslinger,1 point,Thu May 28 17:53:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there remain questions about the precision/quality of the driving models of SDCs at high speeds. As far as I'm aware there probably isn't aren't really too many SDCs that can plot and execute an arbitrary new line with respect to road conditions, wheel slip, etc. It may in fact be more dangerous to veer with an imperfect driving model while at high speeds than to simply try and slow down in a linear way.   One concern is that a driver or passenger in a normal car would probably be able to anticipate and react to the potential impact sooner than a self-driving car's passengers (they're more aware of their surroundings by necessity), since there is a lag time in informing and orienting an unaware passenger.   On the other hand, it's possible that with the realization of an imminent impact, a self-driving car might be able to deploy various other forms of active protection that aren't possible in current vehicles, like cabin shields or external airbags. Since passengers won't be as aware and may not even be held in a conventional position (not all passengers will necessary be seated facing forward) maybe some new kind(s) of active restraint systems inside the car will need to be invented. It could become possible, since the car will be aware of a likely impact before its passengers, that 'slower' (still fast) mechanisms for airbag deployment could be used.  Another option could be 'Deer Shields' for driving in dangerous areas. With no more necessity of having a front-window, the front of the car could be lightly armored or sloped to deflect a deer. Passengers could still see out the sides of their cars."

In areas with high deer risk, traffic can automatically rearrange to reduce risk, creating a slower lane on the blind side.  If deer really do freeze in headlights, then let's use that against them. Equip vehicles with directional spotlights that automatically illuminate objects along the roadside, driving deer away from traffic.  What else? Deer-tracking automated drones?

But I think with the weight reduction possible with car to car and car to environment crashes greatly reduced or eliminated you could instead design fast deployable anti-deer systems.  Cars need to be pedestrian safe, but you could analyze the object approaching, determine it's a deer, and then deploy a brush guard and a windshield guard in some small amount of milliseconds. Design it to work on compressed air or spring loaded instead of explosive charges like airbags and you could make it end user resettable without consumables required. You'd still take car damage should you hit one, but you'd reduce or eliminate the freak deer/moose through windshield kills passenger headlines.

I slowed down from 50 to about 25 to make sure I didn't hit it too hard if it jumped out in front of my truck.  Stupid fucker decided to put its head over the white line just in time for my headlight to hit it. I swear the stupid thing had a death wish.

A couple years before that one reindeer (with huge antlers and all) jumped right in front of me from my side of the road. Same road, friday evening, already dark.

SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,PaulGodsmark,4,Fri May 29 06:22:47 2015 UTC,"I am probably too late in the conversation for most people to see this, but deer/animal strikes is going to be significantly lower risk for an SDC than a human driven car.  THIS IS PROOF: 2min 10sec on Sebastian Thrun's TED Talk  The Google team members describe this incident as travelling along at night in this rural setting and the car suddenly decelerating. They thought to themselves ""Something is wrong, why is the car slowing down?"" - because the team members hadn't seen what the car had seen. When the deer entered the headlight beam arc then it was obvious. Had they been driving then, yes, they would quite probably have hit the deer - or rather - the deer hit them.  Either way - the car did what a human couldn't do - what it was programmed to do.  This incident was back in 2010/2011 when the team was using the Prius for testing and were much less advanced than they are now.  If all deer suddenly turn suicidal and seek out cars, then the SDC will of course have collisions. But I am willing to bet that SDCs will still have a lot, lot less collisions with animals than human drivers do. The SDC is looking 360 degrees at least 10 times a second and will react faster than almost every human can. It simply has a better statistical chance of avoiding contact than you or I."
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,mrsix,2,Fri May 29 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree. I guess my original post didn't make that clear enough because I have read several comments saying this now.  Of course self-driving cars will be better at avoiding collisions with deer than human drivers. The point I was trying to get across is that unlike a lot of accidents that can be completely eliminated by self-driving cars, collisions with deer can only be reduced."
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,mrsix,1 point,Fri May 29 06:24:34 2015 UTC,collisions with deer can only be reduced.   Exactly - although I think the degree of reduction will be astounding - probably greater than an 80% reduction.  The same with almost all classes of vehicle crash/collision - I expect SDCs to see reductions of 80% or more.  BUT - that still means we could be getting 20% of the crashes we currently get - and that is a LOT.
SelfDrivingCars,37kbt4,duhhuh,13,Fri May 29 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"Self driving cars will probably (almost) never hit deer. Deer run in front of headlights, then they get 'caught in the headlights' making the problem worse. Most deer collisions happen on unlit roads near highly treed areas (because that's where the deer roam) especially when trees are near the roadside, which is rare on highways.  Here's the great thing about self driving cars: they aren't limited to seeing the deer with visible light. We already have night vision cameras using infrared and thermal for spotting things, but it still relies upon human reaction time and control.  A self driving car could drive without headlights entirely (though they will probably have them for the humans on board). The sensors (lidar, ir, thermal, and some visual) are superior to those in that BMW, and have much wider field of view by necessity to facilitate self driving. Hooking that superior sensor system up to the superior computer control means the self driving car will see deer long before the human ever knew there was a deer to see, and will easily stop and/or dodge in time.  There are of course edge cases - I know someone who a deer hit him on the side while driving along... While the self driving car has a much higher chance of seeing that deer long before it hits the car it's still impossible to account for every variable."

Had he been in the regular lane of traffic (like a car would be), he'd have at least a little more time for evasive action. Even an extra 8 feet would help in this situation.  I agree with OP to a point, but a self-driving car will have a quicker detection, quicker response, and more inputs to know which reactions yield the greatest chance at avoidance while maintaining control."

It could also communicate the initiation of this maneuver and the exact specifics of it regarding rate of slowing, direction of avoidance etc etc to all of the vehicles within range enough to find that information relevant.

Once you subtract out the insurance company's overhead, it represents the total cost of covered automobile liability (there is some liability in excess of this, not at ton).  So from there the only question is whether SDCs increase or decrease liability. No one is going to get a bigger award just because a computer was driving, a tort is a tort. If SDCs are much safer then it stands to reason that total liability will be much less. There are some off-setting effects (automakers and Google have deep pockets for victim's to try to recover from), but they really only come into play at the margins and shouldn't come close to the difference from having much fewer accidents."

When you bring big companies into the picture, that's called ""deep pockets"", and lawsuits suddenly surge into the millions, especially for something like permanent disability and death.

The average property claim is $3K, the average bodily injury claim is $15K. These suits worth potential millions are actually fairly rare.   So we have a small slice of liability that could become much more expensive. Let's assume all liability is now 10x as expensive as it was before.

Has to be able to work in Snow / rain / ice / fog / night / unmarked dirt roads etc etc.  That itself will probably take at minimum 10-15 years AFTER they invent the technology to allow it to work at night etc.  It would need extensive testing in all these conditions.  So if we are lucky ~20 years from now it might be possible to make a self driving car the public could theoretically buy.  The first models will of course be very expensive.  But wait !  Laws need to be figured out.  Currently only a couple states allow automated cars.  There would need to be some kind of federal laws put into place so people can actually use the vehicles.  Since congress takes forever to do anything this could take years to figure out just by itself.  Insurance needs to be figured out also.  Who is responsible in a crash ?  The manufacturer ?  The ""driver"" ?  A couple big lawsuits are probably going to happen the first time someone dies to an automated car so 4 or 5 years of legal drama will probably need to be figured out before Ford is going to put millions of them on the road in fear of potential liability.

I'd bet that a majority of those who live in the U.S. suburbs will feel the same way.  While on the way to work, I'd rather read than pay attention to driving.  I'd really compare it to why I live in my own house, rather than a hotel room. The car is mine, it has my things in it, that I don't want to always move around. If it's a little more expensive than basically taking a taxi daily to work, I can live with that.  I'd only use a fleet car if I was stuck somewhere, not much different from using a taxi/uber today.

You also have to handle maintenance and liability yourself, rather than outsourcing it to a company that's better prepared to deal with it.  As for as waiting goes, Uber already gets to you faster than ambulances do. That number will probably drop to a matter of 1-2 minutes in a world with lots of robot taxis.

What's funny is I was across from a police station, so if I needed emergency help, I'd bet the police would have beat Uber by a ton. Obviously that's a one off scenario, but it just goes to show you that everything depends on where you are. Yes in inner cities with lots of Ubers driving around they might get there quicker, but in the suburbs, and bear in mind people in the U.S. are moving away from cities into suburbs, the times for Uber are slower than ambulances."

That allows the car to devote its processing power to analyzing the movement of objects that aren't in its database.   I really disagree with this argument. Google did their streetview mapping across most  of the US within a few years. And what will occur is that they will do the initial mapping with drivers, and then SDCs will be able to access that road. The SDCs then will also be mapping those roads each time they drive through it, so the mapping interval will be relatively constant (although I'm not sure how often they need to be mapped to stay current). Obviously this requires some regular use of SDC vehicles over the road, but for highways, this should occur very regularly."

I would love to see a GM or Ford shaking hands with Larry Page or Chris Urmson while announcing such an initiative.   The auto industry is handicapped by their hubris, though, and they hold intrinsic biases that limit their capacity to think greenfield about mobility- And I suppose it's especially difficult when embracing vehicle automation amounts to self-cannibalization.

The top talent in this field doesn't want to be working for the car industry and end up being stuck limiting their thinking to cars, they want to be in a place where AI progress can be applied to whatever it is best suited for- and cars are just one category amongst a whole menu of items that all rely on the same basic research and underlying principles."

Once the research is out there and accessible, it mostly comes down to having big enough supercomputers, big enough datasets, and talent that may not be brilliant enough to invent such systems, but is quite capable of recreating and optimizing them. It doesn't change the fact that not having first mover advantage will be costly.

SelfDrivingCars,37dxld,ChuqTas,4,Wed May 27 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"A little off topic but I have to respond to this bit:   It would at least keep the petrol stations open and stop the job of petrol station worker being obsolete   It is becoming obsolete, and trying to protect it from the future is as futile as trying to protect horse-whip manufacturers from the car.  You need to stop viewing ""work"" as a self-justifying pursuit. We have ""work"" only because we want the things that work gives us enough to in turn do our own kind of ""work"" somewhere else, and we have an advanced system of barter that we call capitalism that helps us decide how much our different forms of work are worth relative to each other.  But when those things we want can can be provided to us automatically instead, by machines, by robots, by automation, that's not someone losing a job, that's someone no longer having to work for a living. We have actually been at this point for quite some time, in my opinion, but we keep clinging to the need for everyone to have ""jobs"" because it is the bedrock that our entire economy is founded on and it too (the whole economy) is on the path to becoming obsolete eventually.   We haven't yet come to terms with what our future post-scarcity economy is going to look like, and that's scary. But we're starting to see the first cracks in the illusion. Guaranteed minimum income is likely the next logical step to tape over the cracks in our economy and keep it from falling apart too soon. But eventually we'll have to come to terms with the fact that, quite frankly, people don't need to work 40 hours a week to survive, and even to prosper (relative to what ""surviving"" in the past entailed). Of course there will always be room for people to strive for more, to advance humanity, and that should be encouraged. There will be room for people to descend into decadence too, but that's not any different from how the super-rich live today. More importantly, working at a gas station does nothing to advance humanity, and we should welcome and celebrate it becoming obsolete."

It happened with ethanol/corn here in America and it would happen with sugar cane in the UK. Technology allows us to make ethyl derivative fuels from nearly any hydrocarbon, but it's expensive and would require additional infrastructure to implement. Electricity, on the other hand, is free flowing. We can certainly clean up the way we produce electricity, but it's the best energy source for automobiles at this time.  It's also fundamentally a bad idea to keep archaic technology and infrastructure just to save jobs. Fuel stations should offer fast charging ports for a nominal fee or they'll be obsolete soon. At least if they can get you to visit to plug in, they can still sell you chips and soda."

We can't burn more fossil fuels. If we're going to make a drastic change, it has to be for the best.   What you have proposed is not fossil fuels. It is other types of fuels, which are net CO2 neutral. Fine. In a worst-case scenario, if there is no better regionally-available power supply, sure. I can see the need arising. Maybe sugarcane producing countries with little other infrastructure can benefit - so there's Dominican Republic and Haiti looked after. Otherwise, there will still be the need to truck the goop outta sugarcanesville, and that will use heavy oil, which is the single most offensive form of transport humanity has got going.   The best social move is to conjoin the 'futuristic' development of self-driving cars with the 'futuristic' divestment of fuel engines. Large batteries as car chassis with in-hub motors provide a minimum of moving parts and the ultimate in durability and standardization, which are key in developing a solid economic model.   DR and Haiti will gladly accept self-driving sugarcars, though, if you are so inclined to develop them. Haiti needs all the love it can get. Peace ~"

With this system, you might get a dirty car .1% of the time.  Keep in mind, these cars can drive themselves to a service center during slow hours ... like at 5am. They can also coordinate to balance load on the cleaning/service center so there are no lines. They will be getting cleaned thoroughly a few times a day anyways.

SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,PaulGodsmark,3,Mon May 25 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"This is pretty significant. I guess Google had some insight that this would happen, this could make their advantage over their competitors even larger. LIDARs are much more robust than cameras and if there is something that people will value with self driving cars it is robustness..."
SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,heltok,1 point,Mon May 25 19:04:04 2015 UTC,"this could make their advantage over their competitors even larger.   I don't think this is the case. Google is just one player. And the reason their results are impresive is because they took care of Control algorithms only. Most of the tech and sensors they bought are off the shelf components from other vendors. As far as I know, Google doesn't make their own sensors, they make their own algorithms."
SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,illjustcheckthis,2,Mon May 25 19:34:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but pretty much everyone else, including Mobileye, Delphi, Tesla, Volvo, Tomtom etc have been putting almost all their effort into doing localization and obstacle avoidance using cameras because LIDARs have been too expensive and fragile. If LIDARs get cheap and durable, a lot of new maps will have to be gathered, new algorithms need to be developed etc.    And the reason their results are impressive is because they took care of Control algorithms only.   Google takes care of the sensing also. See here for example how they do it:  https://youtu.be/7Yd9Ij0INX0?t=785 And they also do both at the same time with RL.   It is true that google buys the same velodyne as everyone else, but google have actually been using it for many tasks with SDC, not just as ground truth for cameras algorithms."
SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,heltok,1 point,Mon May 25 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"It's not just the velodyne, they have several sensors on the car, from different vendors.  EDIT: Do they use Linux for their work? That's pretty cool."
SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,illjustcheckthis,1 point,Mon May 25 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they use cameras for traffic sign detection, OXTS for GPS etc. But LIDARs rock att seing pedestrians, estimating distances to vehicles and localization. And yeah, since they are going the DL/RL route they will be able to take advantage of sensor fusion even more. My point is that their current competitors have not spent nearly as much time and money into LIDARs yet and it will take years to catch up."
SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,heltok,2,Mon May 25 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"DL/RL    I'm not sure what these acronyms are, but after some searching - deep learning/reinforcement learning?"

SelfDrivingCars,377x3u,ianott,1 point,Mon May 25 19:38:43 2015 UTC,WOW. Very impressive tech going on here. A solid state solution to Lidar could mean we see wearables and other devices having some serious tracking abilities built in. Next gen Hololens style device anyone?
SelfDrivingCars,377cey,mrbarricade,3,Mon May 25 14:00:17 2015 UTC,"So long as the roads are multi-modal there isn't much to change.   As autonomous taxis become a thing there'll be reduced demand for roadside parking and increased demand for fluid and efficient pick up/drop off zones similar to what you might see at an airport. The newly available real estate can be easily converted to wider sidewalks, bike lanes, or extra driving lanes, depending on the area.   When humans are removed from the equation completely dedicated driving roads such as freeways will be able to remove a great deal of the redundancy we see in them now."
SelfDrivingCars,377cey,fricken,2,Mon May 25 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"If the designs are logical and consistent then no design should be too complex. It's all just pattern recognition. If the most prominent system get's tripped up so to speak it will be from poor construction of design or poor design.  Roads of the future should be designed differently. That will just depend on adoption rates, etc. Because the needs of humans and robots are different. An autonomous vehicle only zone will emerge. Hopefully before 2020. Here we will see just how little needs to go into road design. Because a common trait of road design, in overcoming a problem, the proposed solution is almost always more complexity.  In the present, it's hard for people to say. Even the most connected people in this sub are feeding off bread crumbs months after something becomes relevant. The average person will tell you something Google had for example issues with from over 3 years ago."

Edit: These: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enDWVkvTPo4  You can't see the light until you are directly under them because of some jackass' idea of using lenses to shroud the light.

For example, one of the trouble spots tends to be road construction. Perhaps construction zones of the future could be fitted with cones that have emitters that feed information to the vehicles around it, whether that be an updated construction zone map or something that trips a  'caution, manual control required' in the vehicle."

SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,fongaboo,7,Mon May 25 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"In the case of side-swiping, I imagine most self-driving cars would brake instead of going off-road.  To get the self-driving car off the road, you'd probably have to box it in, and physically push it off, most likely going off the road yourself."
SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,RockSlice,3,Mon May 25 15:54:55 2015 UTC,What do you mean by 'run it off the road'? Deliberately crash into it head on/bully it sideways/usher it gently off the road?

SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,gophercuresself,2,Mon May 25 15:44:36 2015 UTC,Unless there's a 'dangerous situation - get me out of here!' button then I would presume fairly easy. I would think that as soon as the vehicle detects contact then it is likely to pull over to the side of the road so the necessary details and what have you can be exchanged.
SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,ianuilliam,1 point,Mon May 25 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"This is the same argument people keep making about how self driving trucks will be forced to a so and robbed, and acting like it's an unsolvable 'checkmate, SDC supporters' kind of scenario. It wouldn't be difficult at all to have the car recognize that when it is rammed or forced off the road by another car, there is either malicious intent or a driver who is operating in a highly reckless and unsafe manner. In either case, immediately alert authorities, set off car alarm to alert passengers or other nearby vehicles, open feed to remote data center where technician can assess the situation and take over remote operation if needed.  If the intent is to rob the autonomous truck/car or harm it's occupants, and you are willing to hit it with your vehicle to show this, how is this a bigger problem for SDC than for manually driven cars today? Just accidentally rear end a car, and when they pull over and everyone's going through the motions of ""hey is everybody okay? Let's exchange insurance information. Blah blah blah,"" pull out gun, and do whatever it is you want to do.   Like every other criticism aimed at SDCs, the problem is just as plausible, and probably worse, with manually driven vehicles."
SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,fricken,2,Tue May 26 01:45:15 2015 UTC,Probably not much harder than running a human driven car off the road. Just as illegal. Way more difficult to get away with.
SelfDrivingCars,377l7s,yaosio,1 point,Mon May 25 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"Assuming you don't mean by forcing the car being going off road or into a head on crash, very difficult. If somebody starts slowly coming into the lane, the vehicle should slow down to avoid being hit. If somebody zooms in front of it and slams on the breaks, it will hit the breaks as well, but video will show if that person was doing it to cause a collision if there is a collision. The vehicle should start breaking the instant the other vehicle comes over into the lane to increase distance between the vehicles."

There's a car that's been out for quite a while now that has accident avoidance built in.  Well, driverless cars are going to have that on crack.  The vid that showed what the sensors pick up showed that they actually detect obstacles from quite a long distance away.  Moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, etc, all show up long before the car is even near them.  I'm sure these situations have been considered in the quest for a driverless car."

SelfDrivingCars,374vua,axc86,1 point,Mon May 25 12:28:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is pretty ugly...  The thing I would keep in mind is they probably aren't putting a lot of thought and effort into the design currently. They're focused more on advancing the technology and testing fringe conditions and safety. There's no need to spend money on appearance when you're in that stage.   Especially if you consider the idea of hitting a major bug that totals the car. It's like buying a car for a teenager... you aren't going to spend top dollar because you expect it will probably be wrecked, even if you hope not and believe your kid is smart and responsible. Shit happens.  Regardless, I'd be surprised if Google actually gets involved in the 'hardware' side of cars anyway. They tend to hand that out to other companies.

This is an automobile with much stricter and more robust DoT regulations and a much greater need for infrastructure. It took Tesla 8 years to get out their first production model on the roads and they still only have one after 12 years. No new auto manufacturer is just going to pop up out of nowhere 5 years from now and take over GM and Toyota.

SelfDrivingCars,373e5e,AlfLives,1 point,Tue May 26 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. I would up it to 12 hours though, and up the speed to 90mph. A couple of hours of reading/watching movies on a laptop, and at those distances you'd be doing primarily highway driving and SDC will likely have higher speed limits. Call it about 1000 miles.   Plus, an SDC could literally have a bed, and will be driving smoothly enough to be indistinguishable from a room."
SelfDrivingCars,373e5e,Cribbit,0,Sun May 24 18:34:28 2015 UTC,I'm not sure SDCs should be going 90 mph.  What if a deer just jumps in front of the car from nowhere.  Not everything on the road that is a hazard is another car or will be visible in time to stop or avoid.

Not everything on the road that is a hazard is another car or will be visible in time to stop or avoid.   So, what if a deer just jumps in front of a car with a human driver? What if a human driver encounters a hazard that's not visible in time to stop or avoid it? They crash. And if they're surprised, maybe they do something wrong and make things worse.  SDCs don't have to be perfect or magically able to avoid every accident, they just have to be better than humans under normal conditions, and no worse than humans during extraordinary conditions. Even just by automatically executing a perfect stop when faced with an unavoidable hazard, they'd be doing better than humans - some human drivers panic and accelerate under those conditions."

SelfDrivingCars,373e5e,bomber991,2,Sun May 24 15:37:42 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that trains will simply be replaced by self-driving trains. It's way easier to do than automating cars. London Underground has already talked about it.

Trains require a large investment in infrastructure for the rails and tunnels they use, but can't reach everywhere because space for roads competes with space for rails. Busses and smaller transports can go everywhere there are roads.   Personally, I think bus routes are going to change from a fixed route to more of a dynamic service. When you want to get on a bus, you check in on your mobile app and it will tell you the closest spot where it will pick you up. This will allow the busses to take the least-traffic routes and pick up people where they are that is near their route. It should be more efficient and better service than driving static routes. Only time will tell though!"

SelfDrivingCars,373e5e,AlfLives,1 point,Tue May 26 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"Intra-city will be the first one to be replaced here, I think.   There's Light Docklands Railway in London that's already autonomous. It runs on raised tracks around the business district.   There also are tiny autonomous trains in some airports. Birmingham has one, which takes you from the airport to the train station. You call it by pressing a button and it picks you up.  Heathrow airport runs autonomous pod cars between the terminal and a car park a couple miles away.  Tube for London has already said that they will start replacing underground trains with self-driving ones by 2022.   Trains are really simple, when you think about it. They're essentially horizontal elevators, but bigger. We no longer need elevator operators, pressing a button is enough to use them. Trains will be the same very soon, since it's just so much easier than road transport. No need to deal with other cars or pedestrians, the route is always the same, and it's either stationary or going forwards."

Eventually someone will invent a way to get a SDC to pick you up, scan you and your baggage, clear you to board the plane, drive you to the airport, drive onto the tarmac up to your plane 10 min before takeoff, and let you out in front of your plane. You'll hand over your bag, get on the plane, and leave.   Similarly, at the destination you'll have a car waiting to wisk you away as soon as you grab your bag. Much of existing airport infrastructure could be eliminated and become obsolete and air travel will become much cheaper."

SelfDrivingCars,373e5e,londons_explorer,2,Sun May 24 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"As it is now, you can already rent a car to save on wear and tear, pay for the fuel, and go 700 miles each way for that price for a single person, and save a ton of money if you're taking just one other person with you in the car versus buying 2 tickets.  For 700 miles the flight would probably take about 5 hours each way after adding all the time spent waiting at the airport, and your drive would take about 10 hours each way.  From there, I guess it's just how much you prefer the extra room, privacy, lack of deadlines, easier luggage carrying, and the freedom to stop whenever or wherever and stretch your legs and have a nice meal, versus the extra time it takes to get to your destination.  If your initial or final destination is any significant distance away from a major airport, it'd probably never be better to fly than drive at that distance.  Only reason I'd personally ever choose the airplane is if my location is over 1000 miles away, or if I'm worried about the 33% more carbon emissions you'd be putting out per mile.  Hopefully the electric car revolution will happen alongside the self driving car to make that not a problem, and eventually speed limits can go away to make the trip faster after the humans stop risking everyone's lives with their faulty driving."

Much like MADD it will be driven by people who have needlessly lost loved ones and their stories.  But where it will get interesting is in those places that pull the trigger first all the dreams we are wishing for will come true. Higher speeds, instantly higher road capacities, better vehicle designs, and vastly lowered infrastructure costs (i.e. two lane bridges are a zillion times cheaper than multi deck 8 lane bridges).

But my long standing prediction is that once all cars are self driving that they can lose most of their safety gear which makes up a huge portion of the weight of a car. Thus electric cars become much more reasonable as 200+ HP isn't needed along with anywhere near the energy storage.  Thus as batteries get cheaper and the massive drop in car weights and sizes that electric will absolutely be the future.  But everyone here in SDCs have been making lists of those who lose their jobs due to SDCs and that list is just getting longer and longer. Beyond the obvious such as taxi drivers and the second level of obvious like insurance companies, there will be a very large but almost entirely forgotten group such as physiotherapy people who treat people damaged in accidents or companies that make that powered stuff sprinkled on accidents to mop up the oils. It's not that those businesses will go away, just that there will be a sizeable drop in revenue. The key being that there are a zillion little businesses that either exist because of accidents or have a notable part of their revenue derived from them.  It will also be interesting to see how many businesses turned out to depend on bored drivers as opposed to bored passengers. As a bored driver needs some distraction but not too much. So sipping on a large drink while listening to talk radio is about as much as is safe. A lone bored passenger of a SDC can play video games, sleep, eat full course meals, watch movies, read books, etc.  Thus I can see something like the drive thru just dying or morphing into something entirely different.  So there are two predictions: The drive-through selling the simple meal will go away and drive time talk radio will die.   Also the era of the insano in car entertainment system is about to begin. Basically car as livingroom.  And yes there will be cars that are known as very conducive for sex."

Totally doable if I had a car. I could do it on a tank of gas.  An uber each way would be hundreds. I'd say over 400 bucks.  So in my mind, the question is: Is it worth a 400 bucks to go to the fair this weekend?    The answer is pretty much no even though it technically is still significantly cheaper than owning a car.    But if I owned a car the answer is a no brainer. I'd be going to the fair.  Driverless or not, the model for these kinds of services need to come WAY down in price, or offer an all-you-can-drive model, before it becomes viable over owning. (for a lot of people, anyway.)  *A rental car would be a hundred dollars after feeds, but isn't a door-to-door option like a self-driving car is. But still, 100 bucks, plus having to get to the rental place to pick it up, and then back home when I drop it off ..... I'm not going to go to the fair for that price."
SelfDrivingCars,36vmro,ihahp,2,Fri May 22 21:15:25 2015 UTC,"This is the dumbest economics debate. I wish you guys could do projection spreadsheet, cross analyze and correct for errors and come to a final analysis showing how it would be cheaper to rent.  When a car plays ""cheap taxi"" a trip sac would cost you marginally more then the price of fuel and depreciation.  I honestly bet it will be 10% margin on top of operating expense. Which will be better then ownership because the utilization of registration and low wear and tear (from not being beat on by a shitty human) and minimized lose of depreciation due to idle time.  It will be a no brainer to rent or join a transportation club. I wish I could put money on that bet.  Going to work? Ehhhh send me that crappy one seater car for $0.05 per mile. $4 for a 20 mile round trip.  Date night? Send me a town car for $0.15 per mile  Wedding, give me the Roles, $5.00 per mile  I bet transport becomes as blasé as what type of airplane you fly in... Who cares. Just get me from A to B."

Most people are completely oblivious to the rate of depreciation of their vehicle. Which is the single biggest cost for the average car owner.   The best way to view the cost of car ownership is it's cost per mile. Your fixed costs divided by the miles you drive plus your variable cost per mile.   The more miles you drive the cheaper the per mile cost is. Where as for a shared fleet you will likely pay per mile. The cost per mile would be the same if you did 1,000 or 10,000 miles. A shared fleet fully autonomous electric purpose built vehicle could cost as little as $0.15 ($0.075 passenger) per mile.  Do yourself a favor and stop using today's figures for a cab ride in which the human element (driver) accounts for over 50% the cost of your ride directly and indirectly.   As for your fair problem. Share a ride."
SelfDrivingCars,36vmro,ihahp,2,Fri May 22 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"No you don't. Most people are completely oblivious to the rate of depreciation of their vehicle.    Exactly. What they're aware of is their monthly payment and insurance every few months. That's it. So it feels pretty much like an all-you-can-drive fee. Yes, gas is extra. But gas feels ""free"" for errands around town, and is significantly less expensive for a day trip than renting a car is.   my point of ubering to the fair is cost prohibitive, using a car that I already own is not, perceptually. Regardless of the real numbers. It's a perception thing.    stop using today's figures for a cab ride in which the human element (driver) accounts for over 50% the cost of your ride directly and indirectly.   I used the only known metric we have at the moment, but in my original post I commented that I hope they can get the price down, or people will still want to own, in order to do trips like this.     Do yourself a favor    What's your problem? Do you have some sort of agenda? Go back and read my original post. Some people think we won't own self driving cars, and I questioned that, and I cited some perception. And yes, I used present day prices, but I also said in my original post that I hope self-driving cars have all-you-can-drive price plans.   Why does my opinion bother you so much?  why do you think self-driving-cars just have to be rented, instead of owned, and my posts make you tell say shit like ""do yourself a favor""?

If you want to know exactly why the cost to use such vehicles will decrease dramatically I am right here. Along with others. All you have got to do is ask. Choosing this new model over ownership could save people around $5,000 a year. So for people who have one off annual trips that might cost in the new paradigm sub $100 per passenger then it is totally worth it."

When I pay per trip, I have to look at the trip and determine how much it's going to cost, and see if it's worth it. And that sucks. It takes all the fun out of being able to hop in a car and do a day trip."

The removable trunk would work in your situation, but I think of the scenario where you are running multiple errands/shopping and picking up a few things at multiple stops. You could use your solution, but it might be a pain to wait for your trunk to show up before you go off to you next location. You could 'rent' the vehicle for your entire trip, but I think that is inefficient since the car would just be parked much of the time. Being able to either use a locker at each location and/or having your trunk taken to a secure location at the store when you arrive would work.

Cars will be less owned by people and more by companies that ""rent"" the car for short trips.   More like taxi This means that there would be less cars and less work for mechanics. There would be less chance for a corrupt mechanic to rip off consumers as ""professionals"" will own the car and know better what repairs should really cost. On the electronics that make the self driving cars work I would expect it would simply be component replacement.   Don't think majority of the components would be fixable.   They would be sent off to be fixed in some central location or recycled, IMO. You would also expect the cars to be able to self diagnosis even far better than today.

A fleet operator has the specialists and the equipment and parts. The vehicle can be out of service for as long as they like.

ECU failures would more than likely be software, so you would check for any service bulletins for software patches and update if needed, otherwise replace the unit.

SelfDrivingCars,36vcf1,jesseaknight,2,Fri May 22 12:35:31 2015 UTC,"There is one thing that hasn't really been discussed and that is the ability to maintain a self driving vehicle. As part of a fleet where an operator uses one vehicle type or so, when a vehicle needs to be taken in for checks or to be fixed, etc, the user does not suffer. A vehicle can be taken off the road just like that. The engineers and mechanics, etc, benefit from economies of scale and one or two exact designs. They know the exact inner workings and time spent on the vehicle is minimal. They can swap out parts with ease.   For personal ownership, for legal reasons manufacturers and the autonomous tech developers will not want average Joe or average Joe mechanic tampering with the vehicle. Even if the damage is completely independent of the autonomous systems, it will likely be recalled. The problem here is to where. You either have a group of mechanics and engineers repairing one or two vehicle types or a whole host. If they are specific to the vehicle then your vehicle will be out of action for some time. There is no way that say Tesla as an example will have a repair shop in Ten thousand locations across the US. With more mechanics and engineers at each location than they know what to do with. With an abundance of parts and resources at each location. The vehicle will be sent to a more regional and centralized 'shop'.   In the mean time you need transportation. So we get people having to use a back up vehicle or heaven forbid a shared fleet vehicle. I don't think a manufacturer would be stupid enough to allow that to happen. You are just asking for your customers to ditch you for the shared fleet model by doing that. You will be sent a replacement vehicle or even go without. Is this replacement vehicle even autonomous? Meanwhile your car is spending a long time being repaired and this centralized 'shop'.   In comparison you have a shared fleet of 1000 vehicles. If 100 are out of action there is simply 10% less vehicles in operation. It doesn't have much of an impact on you the customer at all. The vehicles will be repaired/maintained within the vicinity. You simply get on with your life.  Where as for a personal car owner, they may have to send their vehicle off to somewhere countless miles away. In many cases it can't get there on it's own or with you driving. It has to be collected. It also has to come back to you. The 100 vehicles have to be replaced with 100 vehicles in the meantime. The whole process is incredibly inefficient compared to the fleet model.   To be blunt, maintaining dozens of types of personal autonomous vehicles is going to be an absolute ball ache. I don't think anyone has comprehended just how much of a ball ache it will be. Even with vast improvements to the sector, such as the ability to additive manufacture parts or for the vehicle to run self diagnostics, etc, because it is smart. It is going to be a huge ball ache taking apart a vehicle carefully and accurately. There was a video posted the other day showing how it took 1400 man hours just to retrofit a vehicle to be autonomous. At $40 an hour that is $56,000 in man hours alone.   I think it is going to be very expensive to conduct repairs on an autonomous vehicle. As part of a shared fleet the decision is simple and easy. You just scrap the vehicle and use a new one. But for a personal car owner, what do you do? Does you or your insurer spend the multiple thousands on repairs and countless man hours or do you get a new vehicle?"
SelfDrivingCars,36vcf1,Ol0O01100lO1O1O1,1 point,Fri May 22 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"Certainly repairing self driving cars will be more complicated than current vehicles. Well, at least repairing anything involving the autonomous systems--many repairs will go exactly as they go now. But these vehicles aren't going to need many repairs, especially assuming they are electric, and there will be repair shops--of course there will be. Just how often are you expecting there will be issues with autonomous systems?   If anything it will become easier to repair a self driving vehicle. If the vehicle is still mobile it can drive itself to the repair shop while you're at work. Regardless, if it's out of commission for awhile you can just use the shared fleet. Today I have to take a taxi, which costs me about $60 round trip. An autonomous fleet trip would obviously cost a fraction of that.   Less frequent repairs, more convenient, and cheaper alternate transportation. It doesn't seem like an issue to me. Sure, it will be more complicated to repair, but it's not going to take thousands of dollars for every little repair. Systems will be modular and swappable. If you can get a $9000 SDC it's not going to cost $56K to repair it."

Car manufacturers will continue to design automation around their cars. Vehicle manufacturers, autonomous component manufacturers, autonomous vehicle tech developers and insurers will not let average Joe or average Joe mechanic/engineer go anywhere near their vehicles.   Like I said. The manufacturer will not want you to use a shared fleet while your car is out of action. That is the last thing they would want despite it being the best thing.

They pass that cost on to the drivers in the form of a subscription payment that will also cover certain types of maintenance and software updates, navigation services, etc.  So if you want a fully autonomous car, you pay a monthly subscription fee to the manufacturer. If you stop paying, the car goes into full manual operation and you are required to buy insurance separately."

The consumer always pays.  If a manually operated car malfunctions in normal operation is the car manufacturer liable? I'm struggling to see a difference. The car owner pays for insurance because they chose to buy the car and they chose where to take it."
SelfDrivingCars,36nk9a,pointman,2,Wed May 20 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"In my mind, the difference is that with a manual driver, insurance negotiates rates based on their confidence that the driver will not get in collisions based on demographics and driving record. With an automated vehicle the confidence is in the safety rating of the vehicle and its manufacturer itself. Manufacturers of safer vehicles would be able to negotiate lower rates from insurance companies and the rate would have nothing to do with the individual driver."

""But the consumer is more conservative,"" he said. ""That makes us cautious.""   That article also states that Nissan will be ready with their initial autonomous car by 2020. So Nissan's publicly announced that they're building a car with autonomous tech that will be ready around the same time as other companies' efforts. And they acknowledge that fully driverless is ""the future"", which to me indicates that it's in their plans but they're not ready to announce it yet (but obviously the Forbes author believes differently).

Nissan's calling this an autonomous vehicle, but they seem to be on a course to make cars that will still let you take control to some extent if you want to, as opposed to something like the Google Car model which would completely eliminate even pseudo-manual operation. It sounds more like it'll switch between level 4 when you don't want to drive, and level 1 or 2 when you want to drive.  This article articulates it a bit better. They'll have level 3 vehicles ready for next year which can drive by themselves on highway stretches, with fully autonomous by 2020.  Edit: I take that back somewhat. It looks like they're saying this will work in ""nearly all situations, including complex city driving"" for the cars they'll introduce in 2020.

Right now drivers increase the optimal size because they're a large portion of cost (in the ballpark of 30-50%). If you had a weight squared tax, that would make a smaller optimal size. If you remove the driver at the same time that will also push optimal size down. Of course it might still remain optimal to keep the shipping vehicles large, but it's not obvious to me."

Fuel is what makes up a large portion of the cost, so cutting it down results in lower operating costs.

The first national speed limit in 1973 wasn't for safety reasons--it was to conserve fuel.   It seems unlikely we'll be unconcerned about efficiency any time soon. Even if we switch to electric vehicles and electricity prices remain low, we're still concerned with energy conservation and decreased efficiency would decrease range and increase charging times as well.   Still, I can see speeds increasing somewhat, and people being more willing to spend time commuting if they can do other things on their drive. On the other hand, if also seems autonomous fleets will improve transportation within cities, which may encourage people to move into cities as well.   Time will tell which trend will win out.

Efficiency isn't as big of a concern as its made to be, I think. It's a huge concern now because we drive the cars and we're directly linked to the gas prices, but if the gas prices or energy prices were hidden even slightly by auto fueling plans, people might be okay with burning tons of fuel to halve their commute times.  Edit: Drastically underestimated how much ""mpg"" tanks at high speeds. People might still be okay with burning tons of fuel, but it'll be a tough sell.

This is 2006, but I doubt it's improved that much since then.  I knew the fuel decrease with speed was significant, but I didn't realize it was that significant. Of course, I should have since I'm aware that most force operates on some sort of squared law...  As a caveat, I'd like to point out that cars are specifically optimized for ~60mph and ~30mph, where they are driven the most. If the average speed of a car was around 200mph, you would see engines built differently. Also, gas engines become more inefficient at higher speeds. The efficiency of a petrol engine is only around 30-40% at the very max right now. The efficiency of diesel can hit 50%. On-board efficiency is more often quoted at less than half that (~15% and ~20%, respectively). The faster the car goes, the more the friction of the mechanical parts brings down the efficiency of the engine.   Electric cars shouldn't have that problem to the same extent; production cars today have on-board efficiencies of around 80% source. As a result, I would expect electric cars to get more and more popular as automated cars get closer to reality and the idea of ""no speed limits"" takes hold of the public conscious. Not for any logical reason (as my math below shows), but just from hype.  Human error can also account for a lot of gas reduction used. People have hit 109mpg in a prius before by driving extremely frugally. I don't see why those techniques can't be done even more effectively with a computer. The savings have commonly been cited at around 25% gas but could be as high as 30% from a computer, I guess.  tl;dr I was vastly underestimating the affect drag had on fuel efficiency. Thanks for pointing out that. The remaining part of the post is my curiosity as to just how much it would affect electric cars.    I was curious. I used this math but plugged in 90m/s (~200mph) just to see what the energy usage would be. An electric Prius today would use, by his calculations, 152 kWh/100-mi. (The tesla reports a 22 kWh/100-mi usage with combined driving in the city and highway). The tesla's got a 85 kWh battery, so it'd make it just about 56 miles before it pooped out of energy as opposed to the ~300 mile range it enjoys at the speeds we drive it now.   Since electric cars are so efficient with their usage of energy, I don't expect the power usage to be so exponentially inefficiently like it is with gas cars, so there doesn't really seem to be a way to hope that this number will increase any just by getting better at making electric cars. We'll just have to get better at storing battery, and we'll have to figure out how to cram ~450kWh of battery inside the car in order to hit a 300 mile range at those speeds. And then there's the whole idea of trying to figure out how to sustain 300mph+ speeds in ground vehicles."

If the average speed of a car was around 200mph, you would see engines built differently.    The big issue is drag at higher speeds, and all the engine optimization in the world isn't going to affect that. You can make cars more aerodynamic, but that creates two issues: Many optimizations sacrifice customer comfort undesirable in general use vehicles; and more specifically you need to create significant downforce to keep cars on the road at higher speeds. An F1 race car has a higher drag coefficient than a Hummer H1.   And I just saw your tl;dr so maybe the above is irrelevant, but I'll leave it. I will say that one area self driving cars can help with drag is by platooning, but at this point I would hesitate to predict how much."

It's an interesting concept, but I don't see it affecting much because nobody is going to care unless it's in deep urban areas where you can rely on it over 50% of the time. It also has the interesting effect of making someone ""pay"" for being at the front of the line. There would have to be some sort of system to sort out who's in the current ranking of a platoon to make sure everyone spends a certain amount of time breaking the wind and at that point why bother worrying about it or calculating it into energy prices at all? It'd just be easier to go off of non platoon numbers all of the time and see any potential savings as a free gift.   The big issue is drag at higher speeds, and all the engine optimization in the world isn't going to affect that.   That was basically what I realized in the math past my tl;dr. I should've put that up above as well. Even with the math with electric cars that I did (assuming they're perfectly linear engine wise at high speeds) it's still a ridiculous amount of energy you pay for ""only"" 3.333x the speed.  Basically 200 mph is 3.333x faster than 60mph and a tesla gets around a 300 mile range with ""normal driving"" (we'll say 60mph for ease), so 300/3.333 is 90 miles, but you'll only get around 56 miles of range going 200 mph with the math I did. Your range is almost halved, just from air drag alone (since electric cars are close enough to linear output to count).  Gas engines will fare even worse as we see with a car going from ~25 mpg at 60 mph to ~3.5 mpg at 168mph. A 2.8x speed increase, but 7x gas usage increase. Electric is a hell of a lot better with ""2x gas usage"" increase, but the range currently won't justify it at all. Of course, at 3.5 mph the porche is only doing a 42 mile range, so I guess you can say electric cars are already superior in that respect..."

In this case the AV would use more energy.  And another thing.  I bet almost all Autonomous Vehicles are also Electric Vehicles, so the term mpg is erroneous.  Its meters per Joule.  AVs will be EVs by policy mandate, so that the number of vehicles to replace to decarbonise transport is 10% of what it would otherwise be.  The total number of AVs will be 10% of the number of cars today (as today's cars spend most of their time parked waiting for a driver)."

There's another way to do it: plan way in advance. The earlier you start adjusting to hit that gap, the less of a speed adjustment you need to make. For example, suppose you have 2 seconds notice and find you need to increase your speed by 10 mph to arrive at the gap at the right moment. If you had 20 seconds notice, you could just increase your speed by 1 mph.  Another thing AVs could do is communicate and mutually decide which cars should use which gaps in order to use the least fuel overall. For example, suppose there are 3 cars going one direction with some gap between them but not big enough to be usable, and a 4th car needs a gap to cross their path. It can either speed up so much that it beats all 3 cars or it can slow down so much that it waits for all 3 cars. Or, the system could be more intelligent and determine the least fuel would be used by directing the 2nd and 3rd cars to widen the gap between themselves."

It would probably only transition at a rate that only slows down inflation.  94.6% of the land in the US is undeveloped anyways.

When I say speed I mean anything over the posted limit, not going 120mph down the road. Every single person on the street exceeds the posted speed limit almost every time they drive even if by 1mph over simply because of our feet being heavy. An SDC however can be programmed to never exceed the speed except in emergencies. that was the basis of my question...there will be no margin for error. You can basically calculate how long it will take u to get somewhere since traffic will no longer be an issue. I think that will change people's behaviors. You can't leave a few mins late and think to yourself, ah I'll just hurry in the car. It will no longer be an option. That's it. I though that was an interesting concept.

I feel like the car will basically tell you the exact amount of time to get to the hospital and if you have an emergency there will have to be an emergency button that gives you the right of way similar to an ambulance. What about when someone commits a crime and gets in a car. Does the police have the right to hit the emergency button as well?
SelfDrivingCars,36ed8j,christ0ph,1 point,Tue May 19 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"Id SDC are the norm, as is your premise, then I guess the police will not only be able to drive faster than the normal flow of traffic, they will be also be able to do the opposite to the scaping car (using other cars and traffic lights to decrease its speed), even if it is not an SDC.

I wonder when they will expand past Mountain View.  You can't keep going over those same roads as people will criticize them for that saying the cars know Mountain View but nowhere else. You would think they will use the Lexus & Prius to expand the maps.  CA has 394,000 lane miles.  That is counting each lane of traffic.  Do the cars have to go down each lane? I would think not. Even at their current 10,000 miles a day that can be covered in 40 days.  I would not be surprised if they announced they had fully mapped CA, or at least the Bay area this year."

I suspect it takes multiple passes to truly map a roadway. They're looking not only for what's there the first time, but also what has changed in each subsequent pass. That's a big part of figuring out if something's a tree or a person. Also, they can't map areas that are blocked the first time by an 18-wheeler in the next lane.

SelfDrivingCars,3696kb,sien,7,Sun May 17 11:46:57 2015 UTC,"Total distance travelled increases under all of the scenarios we studied. Overall car kilometres travelled over the course of the day rose 6% in the TaxiBot system with high-capacity public transport and nearly doubled (+89%) in the AutoVot scenario with no public transport.  Similarly to all-day travel, car-kilometres travelled at peak hours increase compared to the base case in all scenarios considered (Table 6). For the TaxiBot scenario with high-capacity public transport, this increase is relatively low (9%). For the AutoVot scenario without high capacity public transport, the increase is significant (103%). While the former increase remains manageable, the latter would definitely not be.  In this scenario, road occupancy increases by 40 to 50% for all road classes, with the strongest growth occurring on local road networks. This implies poorer performance and possibly congestion. It may also mean a change in the nature of local street traffic resulting from the presence of additional traffic on what were otherwise quieter, less-used roads. Such an increase in traffic could have a negative impact on the attractiveness and livability of local streets, as it reduces their availability for non-transport use.  These results suggest that shared self-driving fleets may face some transition issues due to the presence of legacy fleets. Unless increases in travel at peak hours are managed, it may be difficult to make a public policy case for self-driving fleets based solely on freed space and congestion benefits in the presence of legacy conventional cars.   These findings suggest that shared and self-driving fleets operating in parallel with private conventional car fleets may lead to even higher parking requirements than today in the absence of bus services.     Note that they are also assuming that people will tolerate up to an extra 15-20 minutes travel duration for each trip (5-10 minutes wait time plus 20% extra travel time up to a 10 minute maximum).

SelfDrivingCars,3696kb,Mylon,1 point,Sun May 17 19:02:09 2015 UTC,I heard about a study that estimated that in the USA there are about 8 parking spaces for every car.
SelfDrivingCars,3696kb,zmatt,2,Mon May 18 12:33:33 2015 UTC,That's a meaningless metric.  Parking is all about location.  My local Walmart has approximately 500 more parking spaces than they ever will need.  That's not benefitting downtown. If you want to include driveways as parking spaces then every self driving car has a place to stay if location isn't important.
SelfDrivingCars,3696kb,Mylon,3,Mon May 18 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"I think that once this becomes routine, there won't be a 5-10 minute wait time - people will have their schedules ready and know when to order their taxi and/or the system will be properly set up to have your car at your door every day at 8:48 in the morning. Also, there will be many times more taxis out there; instead of a taxi usually being within 10 minutes of any given location, there will be one within 2 minutes."

There is a debate over a volcano in the Canary islands  - Could a collapse of its western side (which seems to be possible) displace enough water that the wave would cause damage after traveling across the Atlantic?

SelfDrivingCars,3696kb,zmatt,1 point,Mon May 18 12:39:31 2015 UTC,"I have a Honda that I paid $20,000 for and kept it for 10 years.  My yearly insurance bill has pretty consistiently been $1,000, for $10,000 total.  I put on 100,000 miles, at about 20 mpg, so 5,000 gallons of gas.  Gas is running about $3 where I live today,  that's $15,000 in fuel costs (have to use current gas prices for proper comparison).  Between tires, batteries, regular maintenance and repairs I probably put in about $1,000 a year - $10,000 lifetime.  $100 a year for local registration / inspections - $1,000 lifetime.  $300 a year for tolls and parking - $3,000 lifetime.  That's a total of $59,000 to travel 100,000 miles.  So a robocab charging less than 59 cents per mile would be my basic price point. But consider that 10,000 miles a year at 40 MPH average is 250 hours or 10.4 full days that I am engaged in driving and unable to do any other productive activity (safely). Let's say my time is worth $20 per hour and a robocab travels at 40 MPH on average. I could add 8 cents for 67 cents per mile.  Even though I purchased an inexpensive car and maintained it well, I can't think of a single cost category of mine that can't be trounced by fleet ownership of cars. The only expense a robocab company would have that I don't is R&D and supply of sensors, computers and actuators that make a car self-driving.  EDIT - just realized that a robocab company would also have the expense of re-positioning an empty car to its next pickup. Not sure what the magnitude of this expense would be, but it potentially eliminates any parking fees. Guess it is dependent on how well coordinated the fleet is.  2ND EDIT - if I sell my car today I should be able to get $5,000 for it. My price point should be 54 cents a mile or 62 adjusted for my time value."

Thay are likely assuming that people will remain employed at the same levels as today (highly unlikely) and also that employed people will need to go physically in to some building somewhere. The Internet is making that less and less necessary. So many businesses now have some address of record but no real physical address (one small building in the Cayman Islands is home to 18,887 corporations, however its been shown that the parking lot is never full so the actual number of persons using the building is small.)  The truth is, more and more businesses are virtual, and have no physical address."

I think you're missing the point of what Google is trying to accomplish with their designs. There is going to be a great deal of mistrust and outright fear of self driving vehicles. Google is attempting to shape the public's perception by making early prototype vehicles cute and accessible.   From a purely aesthetic viewpoint I'm not a big fan of Google's design either, but if you look at it in the context of what they're trying to accomplish I think it's a total success. It's not designed for those of us salivating for the arrival of self driving cars, we're already sold."
SelfDrivingCars,365dao,TheAngryPlatypus,-1,Sat May 16 16:26:47 2015 UTC,Looks dystopian and emasculating to me. It's bad taste and poor judgement. People are paranoid about losing their freedom.

For every incident, the claimant gets 3x damages (property and life), and the government also takes 7x damages as a fine.  And with those rules, I would then remove all other rules and limitations.   If you want to fly a pilot-less fighter jet at ground level through city streets - fine - but you pay 10x the cost of anything you damage.  That gives companies a tremendous incentive to make vehicles actually safer, not just meet the regulations."

Ie. anyone can decide to either:   Stick to all the safety regulations and tests for their car.   or   Fill in a form agreeing to the 10x damages and automatic liability and get to skip out all other regulations as long as they can prove they are fully insured.   Some people might say this is ""giving the rich the ability to above the law"", but I would argue the incentive to make cars safer which don't meet the exact letter of our very extensive laws outweighs this.  Others would say ""nobody will ever agree to 10x damages and automatic liability"" - but you would if you were developing a revolutionary technology and needed the ability to do super fast turnaround from the R&D lab to the road, were pretty confident in your own design, but didn't want to spend weeks recertifying the whole car every time you tweaked the software for one more trial run."

As it is, if you live in the sprawl the likelihood of dying a violent death is higher for you than for your inner city cousin as a result of increased exposure to car accidents.   That interlocks didn't pass in the court of public opinion is not the fault of the NHTSA, but overregulating sdcs before we even know what they are comes down to decisions made by a handful of bureaucrats- and this is the fault of the NHTSA.  Let's say a category 5 hurricane was days from hitting the coast of Florida and meteoroligists opted to not tell anyone or issue evacuation orders- would you consider that to be immoral?  Those meteorologists would be tarred and feathered, it would be a national tragedy on a scale likely less severe than what occurs annually on our roads. That we're habituated to this tragedy makes the need to address it no less urgent.

The hurricane example isn't a great analogy (how could they justify withholding that information?) A better example might be cancer drug research. We are very careful with how we expose patients to drugs that are still being researched because we do not yet understand their behavior. We don't allow unregulated testing on human subjects just because a drug may have save a ton of lives somewhere down the line.

States have been falling over themselves to explicitly legalize the technology, with only minimal constraints on developers. The public hasn't yet been convinced of the superior safety of AVs, nor should they as AVs have yet to be proven as safer than human drivers. For example:   For most new technologies, it’s not the data people are interested in, but the anecdotes. In 1.7 million miles logged by Google’s self-driving cars, the company reports only 11 collisions, all of which were minor and all of which were the fault of a human driver. But the fact that a computer was involved in steering one of the vehicles will scare people away from the technology, despite all logic.   The public and regulators are very interested in the data. The problem is, there's very little available. Google's crash rate is similar to the typical driver. His main argument seems to be that because Google claims they were never at fault, then they must have been safer. First, we are taking their word about fault. Second, the ""fault"" is less important to me than overall crash rate. If Google is at-fault in one crash over a million miles, that's safe compared to the typical. But if they crash 20 times in a million miles yet were never at fault, that's either incredibly unlucky, or more likely the vehicle is doing something that invites these crashes. Either way, don't talk about how people are illogical and are only interested in anecdotes when all we have are anecdotes and the data is far from convincing.   But most analyses indicate that computers are nearly always better than human drivers where safety is concerned, and they’re only getting better.   That's a horrible source.  The author goes on to list things that were considered bad at one point, but that no one seems to mind or care about today, implying that AVs will follow a similar path.    War and violence are readily accepted as a fact of life by most Americans, and if people were rational, everyone would drop what they’re doing to stop nonstop violence happening around the world. The National Security Agency’s comprehensive multi-billion-dollar spying efforts are less overt these days, so what’s to worry about? Where today are all the people who once opposed plastics and equal rights for minorities?    We protest against war and violence, all the time. The NSA is getting hammered in courts. And what were the recent police protests about if not equal rights for minorities?

SelfDrivingCars,362ty6,michelework,5,Fri May 15 17:00:44 2015 UTC,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — The latest version of Google's self-driving car — a pod-like two-seater that needs no gas pedal or steering wheel — will make its debut on public roads this summer, a significant step in the technology giant's mission to have driverless cars available to consumers in the next five years.  This prototype is the first vehicle built from scratch for the purpose of self-driving, Google says. It looks like a Smart car with a shiny black bowler hat to hide its sensors, and it can drive, brake and recognize road hazards without human intervention. It has more capabilities than the prototype Google introduced last May, which was so rudimentary it had fake headlights.

It lacks air bags and other federally required safety features, so it can't go more than 25 miles per hour. It's electric, and has to be recharged after 80 miles. And the pod can only drive in areas that have been thoroughly mapped by Google.  At first, it will likely even have a steering wheel and gas pedal — current California regulations require them. Those regulations also require a driver to be able to take back control of the car at any time. But Google is lobbying for more flexible regulations.

The car, which needs no gas pedal or steering wheel, will make its debut on public roads this summer. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar)  Google will initially build and test 25 pods, mostly in neighborhoods surrounding its Mountain View headquarters. It will eventually build between 50 and 100, and will broaden testing to sites that are hillier and rainier.  The ultimate goal, says Google co-founder Sergey Brin, is computer-controlled cars that can eliminate human error, which is a factor in an estimated 90 percent of the 1.2 million road deaths that occur worldwide each year. Self-driving cars could also improve traffic congestion and transport the elderly and disabled.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)  Google shocked the auto industry in 2010 with its announcement that it was working on a driverless car. Brin insists Google doesn't aspire to be a car company, but wants its technology to be adopted by automakers.  ""We want to partner to bring self-driving to all the vehicles in the world,"" Brin told a group of journalists and community members gathered earlier this week to take rides in the prototype.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)  For now the traditional automakers are pursuing their own self-driving technology, but with less ambitious timeline of 10 to 15 years for a truly driverless car.  Chris Urmson, who directs Google's self-driving car project, says the slow-moving, friendly looking prototype — his young son thinks it looks like a koala because of the nose-like black laser on the front — is a good bridge between the company's current test fleet of 20 specially outfitted Lexus SUVs and the more advanced, higher-speed driverless cars of its future, which might not even look like anything on the road today.

This vehicle could go on a freeway, but when we think about introducing the technology, we want to do that very thoughtfully and very safely,"" Urmson says.  Convincing drivers that driverless technology is safe is one of the hurdles the company must overcome. Earlier this week, in response to questions from The Associated Press, Google acknowledged 11 minor accidents in the six years it has been testing autonomous cars. Urmson says the company is proud of that record, and notes that Google's vehicles have completed more than 1.7 million miles of testing. He says all but one of the accidents were caused by drivers in other cars; in the only incident caused by a Google car, a staffer was driving in manual mode.

(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)  Consumers question whether they can trust self-driving cars to work all the time, who will be liable if there's an accident and how self-driving cars will interact with regular cars, says the consulting firm J.D. Power and Associates. In a 2013 survey of U.S. drivers, J.D. Power found only one in five was interested in a fully autonomous car.  Urmson says Google needs to do a better job of educating people about self-driving technology and updating them on Google's progress. It's building a Web site to teach people about the technology, and the site will feature a monthly report that will include details of any accidents involving Google cars. The site will also have a section where people can send feedback when they interact with the cars.

The car, which needs no gas pedal or steering wheel, will make its debut on public roads this summer. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar)  The prototype cars — assembled in suburban Detroit by Roush Industries — have the same array of radars, lasers and cameras as Google's fleet of Lexus SUVs, which allows them to share data. If one car's camera spots orange cones and construction signs, for example, it will alert all the others to slow down in that area or reroute around a lane closure.  Dmitri Dolgov, the head of software for the self-driving car project, says Google's software has gotten much better over the last year at classifying objects, like trees and mailboxes, and predicting behavior of pedestrians and other cars. For example, Google's cars will slow down if they sense that a car in the next lane is speeding up to cut in front of them. And in one recent test, a Google car paused when a cyclist ran a red light. Another car, driven by a human, went ahead and nearly hit the cyclist.  The system isn't perfect. On a test drive, one of Google's Lexus SUVs seemed momentarily confused when a mail truck partially blocked its path. Later, during a demonstration drive in Google's parking lot, the prototype — without a wheel or pedal — braked when it spotted a row of folding chairs. It had to figure out that the chairs wouldn't move before it proceeded."
SelfDrivingCars,362ty6,fib16,2,Fri May 15 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"Dolgov says it's impossible to predict everything its test cars might see, so they're programmed to act in the most conservative way when they confront something unusual, like the time a Google SUV stopped and waited while a woman in a wheelchair chased a duck with a broom.  Google isn't alone in developing self-driving cars. Mercedes-Benz, Infiniti and other brands already have advanced driver assistance systems, like lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, that can pilot the car on the highway with minimal input from the driver. Unlike Google, automakers think self-driving cars will arrive feature-by-feature instead of all at once, giving people plenty of time to adapt to autonomous driving.  But Urmson says that approach is ""fundamentally wrong.""  ""We believe that's like saying, 'If I work really hard at jumping, one day I'll just be able to fly,'"" he said.  Egil Juliussen, the principal analyst of infotainment and advanced driver assist systems for the consulting firm IHS Automotive, says Google's ""moon shot"" strategy is difficult and riskier than just adding features to existing cars. But he thinks it could ultimately be successful. Google could make self-driving urban pods for universities or urban centers, for example, or sell its technology to automakers.  Brin says the company is still refining its plans for self-driving cars, but he's excited about their potential.  ""Our goal is to create something safer than human drivers,"" he said."

Truck drivers dominate the map for a few reasons.   Driving a truck has been immune to two of the biggest trends affecting U.S. jobs: globalization and automation. A worker in China can't drive a truck in Ohio, and machines can't drive cars (yet). Regional specialization has declined. So jobs that are needed everywhere like truck drivers and schoolteachers have moved up the list of most-common jobs. The prominence of truck drivers is partly due to the way the government categorizes jobs. It lumps together all truck drivers and delivery people, creating a very large category. Other jobs are split more finely; for example, primary school teachers and secondary school teachers are in separate categories."
SelfDrivingCars,362lwk,autotldr,1 point,Sat May 16 11:52:50 2015 UTC,"But the negative impact from the loss of jobs will balance with a positive impact from the additional expendable money we all have from the price of everything collectively dropping. Much lower costs and much faster delivery times will effectively lower the cost of all goods in America, which will more than offset the loss of individual jobs. Of course, there will be winners and losers, but overall, everyone will win with automated shipping.  There's not really much people can change considering the technology isn't on the market yet. But truck drivers should start to focus on fleet management, logistics, or maybe knitting."

So the author is offering the situation where the vehicle is mostly automated (NHTSA Level 3) but needs a human when things get complex.  Firstly that means the human will become de-skilled and need to take over in the most complex situations that require the greatest skill.  Secondly, almost the entire benefits of autonomous vehicles are lost because the driver has to remain in the loop. So private ownership of vehicles continues - average vehicle occupancy of 1.2 continues. Vehicles being left idle 95% of the time continues and occupying valuable real estate whilst parked. Etc., etc.  Fully self-driving is an all or nothing bet.  This is the reporting that came out of SXSW following Astro Teller’s (Google) presentation:  “In the fall of 2012, Google had already given out Lexus SUVs to non-Google employees to use — and on the freeway, they worked perfectly well. ""We probably could have made a lot of money selling those,"" Teller said. But something surprising happened: ""Even though people had sworn up and down 'I'm going to pay so much attention,'"" and there were cameras watching them too, ""people do really stupid stuff when they're driving."" Basically, ""the assumption that humans could be a reliable back-up for the system was a total fallacy!"" Teller said. That's why Google began to pursue a car that doesn't even have a steering wheel or a gas pedal.”"
SelfDrivingCars,35xb1f,PaulGodsmark,2,Thu May 14 13:21:07 2015 UTC,"Firstly that means the human will become de-skilled and need to take over in the most complex situations that require the greatest skill.   Complex situations are not necessarily those that require the most ""skill."" Collision avoidance, for example, is probably the thing that requires the most driving skill. Steer into the skid, don't overcorrect, know when to brake, that kind of thing. People are terrible at that. Computers are excellent at it. On the other hand, a  complex situation for a computer might be very easy for a person to deal with. Maybe there's construction with terrible lane markings and a couple of guys directing traffic in the rain. This is really hard for a computer to handle, but not particularly difficult for a human driver. You just go slowly and follow where the guy points.    Secondly, almost the entire benefits of autonomous vehicles are lost because the driver has to remain in the loop.   From a convenience perspective, yes. From a safety perspective, I don't think that's true. For the technology to have a huge impact, all we have to do is reduce accidents. Humans can still take over now and then as long as the accidents they cause during those periods are fewer than the number of accidents avoided during the times they're not in control. That seems like a relatively low bar to me. One that the Google car has probably surpassed already."

OR, (2) the sensor and computer vision technical hurdles that are preventing cars from being truly ""autonomous"" (i.e,, capable of making decisions that were not preprogrammed or anticipated at design time).

Even when driving normal cars - something that requires maintaining situational awareness and active participation - people get distracted, don't focus, and crash. They fall asleep, they think about other things, they do stuff on autopilot without really paying attention, and so forth. Driver error is a really major thing.  To solve that problem, you'd need to find a way to toggle people between whatever they're doing and full situation awareness and alertness in the space of seconds. Going from completely distraction to full attention and awareness in less time than it takes the car to completely halt (because if there's enough time for the car to halt safely, the car can just do that).  At the very least, this entails alerting the operator and taking a few seconds for them to get up to speed. In a best-case, that's maybe a second or two - they were already paying attention to the road, their hands were in the right place. Worst-case, it's not - they weren't paying attention, they were focused on something else, they were half-asleep, their hands were in the wrong place, they froze up for a moment.  What sort of solution do you think that there is to that? (And why hasn't that solution already been implemented in conventional cars - because keeping drivers alert and focused would be useful there too, right?)  (I normally don't like commenting on downvotes, but I'd like to make it clear that I didn't downvote you)."
SelfDrivingCars,35xb1f,fourdots,1 point,Thu May 14 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the problem is solved, or that I have a solution. My point is that we are pretty far away from solving both issues, and that we can't dismiss either one.   I agree completely with what you wrote about switching control in a space of seconds. In fact, a few seconds is probably too long, given how far a car travels in seconds. You'd want the driver available much faster. It is absolutely a huge challenge.   One area people are working on is in biometrics. They are creating monitoring systems that track driver attention based on things like gaze patterns, blink rates, heart rate, head motion, galvanic skin response and even brain scans using technologies like fNIRS. If the car sees that the driver has become disengaged, it can intervene. So intervention happens before the emergency, not after.   There are also techniques like shared control or supervisory control in which the system handles simpler tasks while the driver makes periodic inputs to keep the vehicle on track (enough to keep him/her engaged). This is like a modern autopilot or the way military UAVs are flown.     Again, we're far away from seeing these being used for practical, etical and legal reasons (just like we do with autonomous cars), but its something automobile manufacturers are looking into. Some still envision a transition period between present day technology and Level 4 autonomy where we'll still have to deal with these issues, and they are positioning themselves accordingly.    On the flip side, how will an autonomous car react to a plastic bag blowing at your windshield during a rainstorm? How will it know that mass of irregular pixels moving at 60 miles an hour is less harmful than swerving? How about a pothole filled mostly with water? These are going to be huge issues when Google expands tests to less controlled locations.   It's fine if you don't agree, and you may be right (makes for more interesting responses anyway). All I'm saying is that regardless of whether or not you think there is a solution, there are many who do think it's worth pursuing and they're sinking a lot of money and R&D into it."
SelfDrivingCars,35xb1f,igoo,1 point,Thu May 14 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"We will, and already have, driver assisted automation. I think that is what you are talking about where the driver is basically still in control. None of that works once the car becomes fully autonomous. In that case either the car can 100% safely handle itself or it can't. Nobody is going to put an autonomous car on the road with the requirement that from time to time a human has to take control in order to avoid an accident because that can't be guaranteed. So once you accept that the car is safe to drive itself there is no need to build in systems that would allow a human to take control. In fact in doing so you would actually make the car less safe because a human could unintentionally gain control and cause an accident.   That last situation is why relying on humans would never be acceptable. There would have to be a hand-off procedure to pass control from the car back to the human that confirmed the human's intent to take control. Such a procedure would not likely be able to be performed correctly or in time for the human to do anything meaningful in an accident situation.   Also note that in such a situation the human would have very little situation awareness. For example they wouldn't know how the car was responding to steering during slick roads because they haven't been driving. The worst thing to do at that time would be to try to hand control over to them.  As for the plastic bag problem I'm confident that a simple physics analysis should be able to determine that an object is blowing in the wind and is not something more dense. Potholes can be mapped out by the cars themselves. You have to stop thinking about the problem as an individual human would encounter it. Potholes don't become fully formed in an instant. They grow over time. SDCs would experience the holes forming long before they became a problem and could update their maps accordingly. Every SDC would know the location and severity of every pothole in the area."

""    The part I neglected to say was that I think we will get to Level 4 sooner than people think and I think we'll have problems with Level 3 if it involves any scenario where the car has full control, but the driver is still expected to jump in if there is trouble. Once a car takes 100% control of driving it has to have 100% responsibility too.  What I think will eventually happen with Level 3 is that there will be a definitive handoff of control from human to car in situations where the car has proven that it can perform. Once that handoff is done the human driver will not be able to control the car perhaps except for breaking. You wouldn't want a situation where the driver falls asleep, has a bad dream and grabs the wheel. To regain control the driver would have to do something to prove that they are awake and aware."
SelfDrivingCars,35xb1f,SplitReality,20,Fri May 15 03:55:05 2015 UTC,"The reality that the public, and regulators, have to accept that is self-driving cars don't have to be perfect. They just have to be better than human drivers.  About 1.3M people die each year in traffic accidents. In the US it's about 30,000 people a year.  Is self-driving cars can cut that number in half, then you've accomplished a great thing. If self-driving cars can save 15,000 lives annually in the United States, and 610,000 around the world, you should take that benefit without hesitation.  At the same time it means:  15,000 people will die each year in self-driving car accidents.  The public, and regulators, will have to accept 15,000 people dying in self-driving car accidents. If they don't, they will have to accept 30,000 people dying in human-driving car accidents.  I realize people result readily accept higher risk when they have the illusion of control, and fear safe situations when they don't have control. E.g. people will gladly drive in a car every day (with a 1 in 30,000 chance of dying), but lose their minds when one person in 300,000,000 had Ebola.  tl;dr: decide which is better:   30,000 people die each year in car accidents 15,000 people die each year in car accidents"

Of course not, but it's reasonable to expect that the vast majority of trips will be completed without any input.

SelfDrivingCars,35ub9s,Sidewinder77,7,Wed May 13 15:58:24 2015 UTC,"I agree up to the point when he says the big car companies won't survive with SDCs. They seem to be aware of the technology and are each working on their own self driving features. Automobiles are very complex systems, so not just anyone can come along and start up a car company. People act like Tesla is a startup when it's 12 years old. And it took them 9 years to produce their first original model. The difference with Blockbuster was that they failed to capitalize on digital media. It wasn't their inherent size or age that made them obsolete, it was their lack of vision. I just don't agree that the car companies lack the vision to see SDC coming.   If the oil companies were smart they'd start adding charging stations to their gas stations before Tesla finishes all of theirs. They'll probably have to close half of their stations, but at least they could sell soda and chips to some people traveling."
SelfDrivingCars,35ub9s,sweetmoses,-1,Wed May 13 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"They don't lack the vision that SDVs are coming, they lack the vision of how SDVs will work. Traditional car companies think everybody will buy an SDV for every family member and leave it in the garage all day. Because you don't need a driver's license, even all the little kids will have their own cars.  Fleet owners will own and manage SDV fleets. You'll have fleet owners, fleet managers, and one company or two will do both. Fleet managers will route vehicles and manage communications. If a vehicle breaks, the fleet manager will be responsible for contacting the fleet owner and routing a tow truck out to the vehicle to pick it up. The fleet owner is responsible for maintenance and extra features in the car like an on board PC with a car sim so people that lie and claim they like to sit in traffic can sit in virtual traffic.  Not a single one of the old car manufactures are doing anything at all to get into this market. They are not making deals with anybody, they are not creating their own management software, they are pretending this is nothing more than a really smart seat belt.   Google and Uber both want to enter this market as competitors, and everybody is just ignoring them. The day after they perfect SDV technology, expect an announcement of partnering with a car manufacturer to use their technology. A day after this announcement, expect all the old manufacturers to play down fleet management and come up with some of the most ridiculous reasons fleet management will never work.  If Google partners with anybody, it's going to be Tesla because Google loves Tesla. Even if they have to give a bunch of free money to Tesla to make a new factory just to build cars for them, they'll have no problem doing it. Tesla already develops their cars to be updated over the air, something which Google will demand, and something most car manufactures will scoff at because they refuse to do it now and want the dealership to charge $1000 to fix their screw ups. I doubt Google will open source it like Android, because too many awful manufactures will screw up the SDV install and then blame Google when their vehicles crash trying to drive out of the factory.  There's going to be plenty of room in the freight fleet management business though. These have different requirements from passenger vehicles because the cargo can't get up and move on it's own, yet. 99% of the software produced will be the usual quality of ""enterprise"" software, but somebody is actually going to make something worthwhile.  One thing this article misses is the effect of job loss. People will be spending less on transportation, but millions of people in just the US are going to lose their job within 5 to 10 years with commercial fleet management. It does not matter how cheap transportation is when you have no source of income. This is going to lead to even lower wages, and a lot of ""there is no problem"" by the government and economists as they twist statistics.  We also can't forget about intelligence automation in other industries, that are going to have similar effects in mass layoffs. Phone jobs that follow a script exactly are prime for replacement, and at least one company already has an automated system installed."
SelfDrivingCars,35ub9s,yaosio,1 point,Fri May 15 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know if they expect more SDV cars to be sold. For all of the individual households that may buy fewer cars or just rent cars, there are a ton of people who will buy fleets just to rent them out. If a person has the credit and revenue to buy a car lot, they could also opt to buy a fleet of rental vehicles that will generate much more money over time. My point is no matter how the cars are ultimately used and who ultimately buys them, GM or Ford or Toyota will still manufacture the vast majority of vehicles on the road.  The problem that Google and Uber have is that neither one of them actually manufactures any vehicles. So even if they develop the best business model, they still need a manufacturer to actually make the vehicles. Look at all of the Ford Crown Victoria cabs out there. Ford didn't really set out to make cabs, but cab companies all decided on that vehicle for their fleets. That still puts Ford in a stronger position than any of the cab companies even though that's not their business.   I don't think anybody is ignoring Google or Uber. But ultimately Google will just license their software and Uber is just a big cab company. I don't think any manufacturer overlooks fleet sales now. It's actually a huge part of their business. So why would they overlook it in the future?  I also don't see Google partnering exclusively with Tesla. I know that's a geek's dream, but reality has shown them working much more closely with Toyota. Google will most likely work with every car company as that gives them the best chance to license more of their software. Partnering with a tiny company like Tesla is too limiting and actually more of an Apple move.  Cheaper transportation costs affect the broad economy much more than lost jobs. Transportation costs factor into everything we buy, so making that cheaper and speeding it up (also removing the majority of the liability) just makes everything cheaper across the board. That actually could lead to much higher wages as more consumers have more expendable income."

Now you could sue the manufacturer in a civil case, and if you can show the manufacturer was negligent you can win damages.   It's important to note that the mere fact an accident occurred isn't sufficient to find liability. It's unreasonable to expect any driver, human or computer, to be completely flawless. The same goes true for any other product, including your brake pad. Just showing it caused the accident likely won't be enough. You'll have to show there was a significant problem the manufacturer knew about (or should have known about) and should have fixed.

As such there will be much higher expectations for the performance of SDVs than any other system that we normally use on a day to day basis. Unless an accident is act of God unlikely then it will be presumed to have been considered by the manufacturers and therefore if the machine malfunctions then the error is with the manufacturer.   Say I concede that for a fender bender you might take responsibility. Why would that be different in liability terms to that same car having a glitch and mowing down a kid? Will people end up behind bars because a car they had no control over but happened to own killed someone?  Of course a massive plus for SDVs is that what with the mass of sensors and cameras every minutiae of an accident will be recorded and blame can be easily apportioned. Errors will be recorded, adjustments made if necessary and new versions of the software quickly rolled out. If a malfunction causes a crash and an update takes place to fix said error then the manufacturer has implicitly already taken responsibility for the accident. The one party I can't see sensibly taking that blame is the guy reading the paper in the back seat."

It potentially helps to solve some of these issues people worry about, but really I don't think they're worth worrying about.   You have to pay for insurance now, and there's a pretty significant chance you'll be in an accident. With self driving cars you'd pay even less for insurance and be less likely to get in an accident. That's a pretty good trade off; I'm not going to bitch and moan about not being ""in control"" when there's an accident. That's the entire reason I want SDCs in the first place is so I don't have to be in control.   Financially the burden is going to fall on the end user regardless, so why get worked up over who the modest bill gets sent to?

The other levels can get away with single string on the autonomous controls because you will still manual steering and brakes depending on how they're implemented.

Instead, you book an airline ticket, and get the luxury of travel without the associated pitfalls of ownership.  Why would cars be any different? Its only not happened yet because we didn't have the technology to enable it. Now, we do.  Renting is the same. You get the benefit of being mobile, and only committed to a property/location for your lease term. You're not responsible for maintenance, the management of the property, etc. To offset the opportunity cost of the appreciation you would've seen, you only need to save in some sort of financial investment vehicle (ie a brokerage account at Vanguard with index funds) that nets you at least 3% returns after taxes (real estate, historically, appreciates at an average of about 3% a year).

It's not a private jet, but it will get you from A to B faster than a car. And it's cheaper than people expect it to be. And it makes a good hobby.  So for some people, owning a plane might be a good option.  At the end of the day, what's the most economically viable position and what's most satisfying tend to be different, though.

Maybe 2 hours a week tops.  Thus it makes excellent sense for me to ditch ownership completely.  Where many people get this whole ditch the car thing wrong is with commuters. In theory all commuters should be using public transport, but they don't. Thus simplistic logic doesn't always seem to work. Where commuters are wildly different than me in usage is that they all tend to use the cars at the same time. So for a commuter to ditch their car that peak load of cars would result in a whole pile of cars that don't get used for the rest of the day. Whereas the car I would be using would be busy most of the day. So I can share the cost with many while a commuter would be, as you say, just paying someone else rent.  So I see commuters continuing private ownership much like they do now. But where it will get interesting is when all manually driven homicide vehicles are banned and thus the SDCs can drop a huge amount of their safety gear. The #1 feature that can go is the whole ""Give as good as you get"" size issue which is why smart cars are shunned while SUVs attract so many. With that need off the table the whole idea of a something that is a small motorcycle with a shell becomes a viable option. (presently known as a death trap)  I would love a vehicle that seats 1 or 2 in a reclined position and keeps the weather out. Small, light, narrow, and probably battery powered.

I'd have one as a second car but I do too much driving in state parks and on back roads get rid of a manually driven car. You'd have to be insane to take a self driving car to visit many of the waterfalls here.

See, that's a problem that you specifically have encountered. Doesn't mean it holds true for everyone. I've spent much less time driving off-road as I get older.  You also seem to assume that ""self-driving"" means you would be prevented from taking manual control of the car. This also isn't really true; the autonomous vehicles currently being developed by major manufacturers are the sort where the driver can take manual control."

Another thing that happens when you get older is you stop blindly believing companies that tell you their product is the most amazing thing on the planet. SDC's are still in the experimental phase. With the current state they're in, it shouldn't be surprising that so many older people have no desire to own one. Once they're on the roads and we all see that they do actually work, then a lot of those opinions will change."
SelfDrivingCars,35pamh,ObiWanBaloney,2,Wed May 13 09:40:20 2015 UTC,"I'd have one as a second car   i think you entirely missed my point.  you won't be owning one, if you want to go drive to a national park, you'll own a a non-sdcar.  it of course will be a luxary, as using the rental cars will be cheaper for the majority of travel, let alone keeping the insurance active.  further, SDCs shouldn't be prevalent for another 15 years (2030).  at that point most of the 35 plus will be 50+ and the luxary of not driving will surpass many of their desires to drive.  mixed with our youthful eagerness to experience technology, i don't see this as much of a problem."
SelfDrivingCars,35pamh,lawrensj,-1,Tue May 12 14:05:54 2015 UTC,"wow, talk about close minded.  so i'm going to break down your arguments 1 by 1 so i don't have to do it again.   people enjoy owning things. I for one would adore a self-driving car, but I'd hate to rent one from some third-party company   this is called a cab, and using Uber as a definition, you are in the minority.  CERTAINLY in the cities where there is now a majority of the population and that trend has every reason to continue.   Why should I be beholden to there being a low demand for cars?   because thats how market work.  supply and demand my friend.   I have medical conditions that require medication; should I run out on a rainy day, I'd in all likelihood call up my rental place and say ""I need a car to get me to the pharmacy"", and they'd say ""due to high demand, we can't get you a car today"". Uh, fucking no, I need this medication.   OR, uber delivers, and an autonomous car will deliver it near instantly.  its a matter of costs not of number of cars.  its called surge pricing for a reason. and because no human will be involved it will be cheaper.   I absolutely would not sign up for any agency that meant the car that drives me to work might have been scribbled on by some badly-behaved toddler before me.   again see uber.  how it gets implemented is another story.  surge pricing for nicer vehicles seems all but inevitable.   . I absolutely would not sign up for any agency that could deny me access to something that I genuinely need as a tool in the modern world, simply because someone else that I've never met has had a particularly busy shopping run.   see you are really rubbing me the wrong way.  you assume that they won't have extra?  you assume they won't plan for peak?  you assume so many wrong things, i am having a hard time keeping the ad homs down.  they will send you a car if you request it.  maybe they intentionally keep stock low so they can increase prices, but competition will beat them, assuming we don't allow a monopoly over the situation, which we probably will.   I cannot physically drive a standard car because of my medical conditions. Should I be prevented from accessing cars for going to a national park, because I should be punished for not being able to access a ""luxury""?   again someone will be happy to rent you the car you need.  if you think that owning a car for going on select trips to national parks (which i live next to mind you), is cheaper than renting a car for a day here and there, i have a some snake oil to sell you.   I know that most of the people I know who want self-driving cars would also be up in arms if they weren't available to them for private ownership.    you have no data, and more than likely given your response, you're in the 35+ category.  i'm going to go with a solid 45.  THAT SAID, i never said we were going to have a choice in the matter.  but hey, keep a hold of your car, until insurance rates spike due to the drop out from the rest of the market due to SDCs.   I don't WANT to have to rent something that I should have a right to own outright.   and who cares what you want?  the corporations will, for a price, but what makes you so special? unless its large sums of money, you don't really have a say, you are a data point in a sea of data. like i said, it will be a luxary for the rich.  if you can't see how ownership of things is slowly slipping from our hands, largely due to the politics and economics of what i have assumed your generation to be, then you are blind. (edit i hope thats not your medical condition, i apologize if it is)"

SelfDrivingCars,35pamh,JoshuaZ1,1 point,Tue May 12 17:56:35 2015 UTC,"i can't, and who knows, anything can change, i'm just saying, on this current path, thats where were going.  its a matter of over population, if the lower estimates of population are true, by 2100 or something like that we may be down to 6B humans on the planet, and everything i said goes out the window.  but thats a little too Utopian for me.  it still peaks at around 8B in 2050.  combined with the movement into cities, the pool of people taking home loans goes down, the prices on those loans go up, circling down.  couple in the, what i call normalization, of world wide wages.  the 'lavish' lifestyle that large swaths of american society enjoy will likely not be affordable any more.  more sliding of the middle class, more increase in Gini.  put that all together and what do you get? loss of ownership of land and housing.  its already happening in places like NYC, no one can afford to live there, and yet so many depend on it.  maybe we start building to the sky, maybe a progressive comes along (#bernie16!!! politicing over) and trys providing true affordable housing to the people, or more likely the democrats try and help the people and put regulation on the banks, who simply pass the costs into the loan pricing, making houses even more expensive. Hey, maybe i'm wrong, we can hope i am.  now take that congestion, and add parking fees, add insurance fees, add in congestion fees, more tolls, more private ownership of roadways.  with the benefits of a smart grid, on demand transportation will make the NEED for ownership obsolete, let alone the economic disadvantage."
SelfDrivingCars,35pamh,lawrensj,0,Tue May 12 18:00:20 2015 UTC,"One of the nice things about precise predictions is that they are falsifiable. So if one said something like ""By 2050 at least X percentage of Americans will not own houses"" we can go back and tell if that percentage actually happened or not. This is one of the problems with a lot of futurists: they make narrative predictions without hard numbers so it is much easier to fit their predictions in as being correct later. Precision is important."

So while it won't remain 1 in 3 I suspect that it will never easily crack 1 in 10.... until manually driven cars are banned.

The economic payoff is huge.   I think the growth will be significantly slower in other areas, particularly if the cost of the technology ends up being high. Vehicles are expensive and infrequently replaced, which I think will somewhat limit their rate of adoption compared to say smart phones or digital cameras. I think we're looking at a transition period of decades. Once the vehicles are released and pricing is established and initial demand can be seen it will be easier to narrow down.  Also it seems that privately owned manually driven vehicles and shared self driving vehicles are the only options you're considering.

SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,PaulGodsmark,2,Mon May 11 21:48:52 2015 UTC,They said back in January that they wouldn't build a car and were looking for partners.  Then before that the last update of substance was revealing the prototype which was about a year ago.  Should be getting something of substance soon I would think.
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,walky22talky,1 point,Mon May 11 21:53:55 2015 UTC,I sure hope they'll keep a regular publishing pace.
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,walky22talky,10,Mon May 11 22:01:40 2015 UTC,"I really want to write a full response, but I have to run. Interesting facts:   1.7 million miles driven 1 million miles autonomous 20 vehicles active 10,000 miles/week   They talk a lot about a baseline, but never get specific as to what the baseline crash rate is. 11 crashes over 1.7 million miles is 154,000 miles per crash. That's very close to the 160,000 miles between crashes for drivers in the U.S. I forget if the latter number is reported crashes or estimated all crashes; as Google says, some of their crashes appear small enough that they ordinarily wouldn't get reported. That said, Google's cars all have trained drivers with clean records who are willing to take over and are paid not to get distracted. Just with that fact alone they should have a slight advantage over the typical driver which includes teens, the elderly, drunks, etc.  This does discourage over-reliance on Google and others' self-reported crash statistics. They had said several times that they were only involved in two crashes. They're also still not giving specifics about which crashes were under human control and which were under computer control. They don't have to."
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,altCognito,2,Tue May 12 02:35:13 2015 UTC,"10,000 a week is about 500,000 a year.  Once they get the 100 prototypes up and running they can do 5x that."

SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,altCognito,5,Mon May 11 21:12:37 2015 UTC,"It can happen.  If someone pulls out in front of you for example your choices might be to either hit his car or swerve to avoid it but in doing so hit people crossing the street.  A self driving car would need to be programmed to hit the car instead of veering into the people even though that is the ""safer"" option for the occupants.   I have seen plenty of examples of those situations.  Just visit /r/roadcam"

Why?  A human is under no moral obligation to hit the car in such a circumstance and risk greater injury to himself.  I don't want MY car determining my life is worth less than someone else's."
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,altCognito,2,Tue May 12 10:18:54 2015 UTC,Say you are on a city street driving 25-30MPH and someone pulls out of a parking garage right in front of you.  You would swerve into people crossing the street instead of hitting the other car?  No one is going to die crashing at 25MPH.

SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,reddixmadix,0,Tue May 12 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"Your original question was that plowing into the people was ""safer"" for the occupants of the vehicle, and I'm sticking to that.  In such a case, what I would do is irrelevant.  What is MORAL is, and in such a case, it's perfectly moral to react by plowing into the people to avoid collision.  Also, while IANAL, I'm not aware of any legal grounds for punishing a driver who makes such a choice to protect themselves."

SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,mindbleach,5,Mon May 11 22:55:52 2015 UTC,"A good thing this failure to recognize objects never happens with humans. It happens all the time. Everybody acknowledges that SDC need to prove a significantly better driving record than humans before they are accepted. After that, all these hypothetical, ""who do we choose to die"" situations are purely stupid because on the whole, humans do a shitty job driving and frankly, quite often making moral decisions.  Furthermore, [computers in controlled situations]((https://gigaom.com/2015/02/13/microsoft-says-its-new-computer-vision-system-can-outperform-humans/)) already recognize objects and persons faster and better than humans).

Human error is far more acceptable than machine error.    No, both are unacceptable. We prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars.    Who is at fault when the machine fails?   The manufacturer will be at fault. They will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault. There are lots of sensors and therefore tons of evidence. SDC will drive very defensively and I bet they can get it to the point where the liability/risk is worth the reward. They'll probably carry liability insurance per the number of SDC cars/miles driven. The cost of this insurance will drop as the number of safe miles driven piles up.    Now, having people killed because a smartass somewhere thought ""i'll make it hit the smaller object"" is not an acceptable outcome in any situation.   Again, you might think you're awesome and not a smartass, but I recommend you listen to the horror stories from people who have killed people on bikes or children who ran out into a road, and tell me whether or not you think you can do better than them. Computers can and will do a better job driving than humans. Accidents involving machines that make their own decisions happen already (with machines a lot dumber than these cars). They will continue to happen. All humans have to do is make sure the tradeoff between human decision making and computer decision is safe enough to try. Did you know that airplanes land themselves on a regular basis? That in fact they land themselves in conditions that humans would find difficult?"
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,TotallyNotUnicorn,4,Tue May 12 00:31:55 2015 UTC,"You're missing the part that 'hit the smaller object' is the LAST decision method the car uses, after all others. Collision avoidance can't stop the car. Human/object identification doesn't classify the two objects differently. It didn't see the situation coming, and it's happening so suddenly that nothing can be avoided.  In that case, given two objects which are identical, and cannot be differentiated, it will hit the smaller one.  That sounds great to me."
SelfDrivingCars,35mo7s,The_Yar,4,Tue May 12 01:42:18 2015 UTC,I'm not comfortable with such nascent technology attempting absolutist moral reasoning. You're asking for a possibility that the car may erroneously detect a person on a bridge and drive off the side.

SelfDrivingCars,35ff0a,heltok,2,Sat May 9 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Even with a perfect memory, the car still needs to compare its mental maps with what it’s actually seeing. How that’s done depends on the sensors aboard the car. In the case of a laser scanner, like the one on the roof of Google’s car, the hardware generates a millimeter-accurate 3D representation of its surroundings that’s called a point cloud. Because point cloud images are so incredibly accurate, it’s easy enough to compare the prior map to new data using well-known algorithms that compare the two maps—prior and present—aligning them as closely as possible. That makes it very easy to identify with sub-centimeter precision where the car is on the road.   Not that easy. ICP is slow, gets stuck in local minima(depending on how you implement it) and is sensitive to dynamic objects in the environment. There are other methods but they are far from easy and the problem is not really solved for commercial applications yet."

If impact on OEMs, then they have a vested interest in certain outcomes, which someone outside their sector might view very differently and have different priorities.  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) could be transformational to society, dependent on how they are deployed and the policies that are put in  place around them.   E.g. If we want to reduce private vehicle ownership, increase ride-sharing and reduce congestion with AVs then some OEMs are very likely to lose out.  But if we want to continue the current business models and primarily sell AVs as private vehicles then that will be great for the OEMs, but maybe not so good for municipalities and congestion etc.  If a city has a very large OEM manufacturing base, then they might decide that private ownership policies are best for them overall, because of the wider economic prosperity.

I depend on that happening by the time I'm too old to drive.  Look at it this way:   Your SDCs save 100,000 lives.  You get a reward for $X for that. You get sued for product defects 1000 times because people got injured in the vicinity of you SDCs.  That costs you $Y (most of this is attorney's fees, or settlements.)  They don't need to win to cost you money.    And yet auto executives seem to be far more worried about the liability they face than in bringing this life-saving technology to market.   $X - $Y = Motivation.  $X, so far as I can tell, is $0.  There is no reward for a car company that saves lives.  Now, if there is a financial benefit for the company, I'd love to hear what it is.  $Y is hundreds of millions for the first car company to produce a level 3 or 4 SDC.  You cannot expect them to take this on for free.    Executives are routinely sued for neglecting the financial interests of their shareholders.  They can't act like charities.  It's illegal for them to put the public good ahead of the business.  So long as $Y is big and $X is zero, they cannot engage in building SDCs."

Taking the analogy further, sort of like how I have administrator power on my Mac OS X install, but I can have Guest, regular user, levels of access etc. - maybe SDCs will have that sort of thing.  An SDC is not inherently bad, but the reality is, I doubt that drivers will be allowed to sleep or read behind the wheel, even if the car is driving itself."

Nobody is saying that SDCs can't fail. What they are saying is that they will fail less than people do because people as a whole are really bad at driving. I also think that SDCs will fail less badly then people fail. When a SDC gets confused or has a problem its just going to immediately hit the brakes and stop. It's not going to be drunk driving, or falling asleep, or being distracted by changing the radio, and then run into someone."

SelfDrivingCars,35af7o,Neebat,3,Fri May 8 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"The National Highway Safety Administration has defined four levels of automation for cars.  SDCs are levels 3 and 4.  While it's not defined this way, the real difference is the amount of notice the car will give the driver when it is unable to continue safely.  At level 4, the car must anticipate when it will be unable to continue safely and maneuver to a safe stopping point without a driver.  There may still be controls, but the operator isn't expected to be attentive.  At level 3, the driver must be ready to take over control within seconds.  These are definitions, not regulations.  Actual cars may blur the lines or have some other kind of distinction entirely.  It's expected that both kinds of cars will be supported by legal frameworks.  Google is targeting level 4.  Automakers seem to be targeting level 3, slowly.  Tesla has predicted the Model S should be fully autonomous at low speeds, on private property, as soon as the software is ready.  Since it would be operating without a driver, that means no ""Big Red Button"", no buzzer to wake someone up when it gets into trouble.  That's level 4.  (Tesla's highway automation is much more modest, closer to level 2 or 3, with a driver in charge at all times.)  The distinction between 3 and 4 is critically important for automakers.  If there is a driver involved at all, they have a chance to avoid a product liability lawsuit."

In an event where a human driver feels uncertain as to what to do, they will often slow down or come nearly to a stop until they can figure out what is going on and make a decision.  A level 3 car is not going to beep, warn the driver that something needs to be done, and then slam into the back of another car if the driver doesn't take action.  They will slow down and either attempt to re-evaluate or let the human driver take over."

Your point on product liability lawsuits is good, too, given how we live in a very litigious era."

Level 3 is deeply flawed, because the computer may be turning over control to a driver too late to change the outcome.  The car company would still get to say, ""It was under human control at the time of the accident"", but it would still be a defective product.  And level 3 does nothing to realize the savings in the opportunity cost of having a driver.  There is simply no financial means for an automaker to take responsibility for a level 4 car."

Volvo is known as a safety focused company, so they could implement it earlier then others. I also think the manufacturers will see the writing on the wall and it will become a race to who reaches level 4 first - and that race seems to be heating up. And if a manufacturer were to partner with google and have shared liability, that could in turn be a future return on the investment. Business is risk, and companies will take risk to enable a larger future revenue. Some of these risks do fail though, but none of the car makers want to become the next Kodak.   Edit: Plus - if a manufacturer were to partner with Google, hundreds of millions of dollars in R&D has already been spent.

Yes imagine such a scenario a narrow winding mountain road a child appears out of nowhere and a decision has to be made by the vehicle, except it already has.  Unlike limited human senses an autonomous car will have a multitude of equipment that can identify risks outside of the confines of human vision. Infrared, sonar, laser, 360 degree view, ability to talk to other cars and enabled objects. More than likely the vehicle would have identified the child in advance its location, heading and velocity. The computer would then instantaneously calculate possible headings, odds of collision, points where collision might be possible and in the blink of an eye make some adjustments to minimize the risk of impact: brake, accelerate, alter route, etc.   What the world needs to come to terms with is that in time the mechanical mind will be far more capable at making correct decisions than the human mind.

SDCs able to coordinate in even a limited fashion should be able to remove huge amounts of traffic congestion as groups of cars move as one. Imagine a traffic light changing and rather than each car taking 1-3 seconds to start moving they all move at once. Similarly at junctions cars just pull out and thread together perfectly.

If I have insurance, my insurer is financially liable for any damages done to my vehicle or my person and also other vehicles and other people depending on the situation. I'm not financially liable because I have insurance. But if I kill someone I could be legally liable for their death.   In the case of an SDC, the financial liability still remains on the insurance company no matter what. The legal liability would likely fall on nobody because no individual was in control of the vehicle. If there was a software or hardware defect that caused the accident then obviously that would be the fault of the manufacturer. But if the car itself causes an accident (which again, you haven't described how this would happen, except for some vague delusion you have about people tricking their cars and programmers not being able to develop an adequate handoff procedure) then nobody goes to jail for anybody.

SelfDrivingCars,3579rf,PaulGodsmark,3,Thu May 7 20:52:18 2015 UTC,This leads to a serious health concern. There's already a fair bit of evidence that having more public transit in the form of buses and subways helps keep a city more healthy because people are encouraged to walk more. (See e.g. here). Cars in contrast since they can get much closer to their intended destinations don't have that minimum walking amount involved. If driverless cars beat out public transit then we may see an increase in the obesity problem.
SelfDrivingCars,3579rf,LessonStudio,2,Fri May 8 02:55:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. In my presentations I put obesity up as one of the major potential downsides of AVs. I also stress that AVs will make pedestrians and bicyclists feel, and be, much safer in cities. So I stress that we have the opportunity to put policies in place around AVs that will promote active transportation and therefore hopefully better health."
SelfDrivingCars,3579rf,RecordHigh,1 point,Fri May 8 18:05:23 2015 UTC,"One key factor that needs to be taken into account is the risk factor for reliability. In a city like mine where traffic sucks but still works then driving is generally going to be very predictable and reliable. Our transit system is magically broken and thus is the opposite.   For a typical employee arriving to work on time can make or break their continued employment. Thus anyone in my city who wants to keep a typical job would be well advised to get a car.  But in a place like New York City the transit (commuter trains) are quite reliable as opposed to the higher risk of driving a car for when something goes wrong in NYC it really goes wrong. One good accident can clog things up pretty badly.  Then there are other factors such the cost of parking and the overall difficulty of even finding parking.   So I suspect that while the crude number of cost per mile will be a significant factor that other pressures could wildly push the actual adoption rate to either extreme. For in my city cheap robot taxies could devastate the local bus system.  Also there are many people who take the bus not because they prefer the bus, its costs, or are having eco-feelings but because the can't drive due to disability, age (too old or too young), or legally can't. Robo taxies would mop up this crowd as well.  If my elderly mother had the option for a robo taxi/car she would be all over that in a second as would most of her friends."

I sat close to that team and I’m friends with a lot of them, so I have a sense of what they’re doing. But I was not contributing directly to them.  I think self-driving cars are a little further out than most people think. There’s a debate about which one of two universes we’re in. In the first universe it’s an incremental path to self-driving cars, meaning you have cruise control, adaptive cruise control, then self-driving cars only on the highways, and you keep adding stuff until 20 years from now you have a self-driving car. In universe two you have one organization, maybe Carnegie Mellon or Google, that invents a self-driving car and bam! You have self-driving cars. It wasn’t available Tuesday but it’s on sale on Wednesday.  I’m in universe one. I think there’s a lot of confusion about how easy it is to do self-driving cars. There’s a big difference between being able to drive a thousand miles, versus being able to drive anywhere. And it turns out that machine-learning technology is good at pushing performance from 90 to 99 percent accuracy. But it’s challenging to get to four nines (99.99 percent). I’ll give you this: we’re firmly on our way to being safer than a drunk driver.   Another expert in the maybe 20 years away camp.  So many people here seem to think Tesla is magically going to give us self-driving cars in the next few years, or Google less magically (unlike Tesla, at least Google has a significant in-house research program).  But they are really a long ways off."

But I don't see self-driving cars having an especially big impact on the TV/film industry relative to other industries. If I were thinking about new technologies that would impact the TV/Film industry, I would look to things like VR which I think will drive demand for more immersive entertainment experiences across the board, not just in video games. I think many people will still want the traditional TV/movie viewing experience, but there will definitely be increased competition in the industry."
SelfDrivingCars,355qbr,pie-kun,1 point,Thu May 7 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see this as being too much of an issue. Minority report and iRobot were two films that featured quite good action scenes with self driving cars. In the former a police override stopped Tom Cruise's car so he jumped from one to the next, in the latter an AI takes command of Smith's car and sets robots on him forcing him to switch to manual.  So action car scenes will be fine, they just won't necessarily involve the main character driving. For example; in a James Bond film Bond could spend the time in the car operating it's weapons, shooting out of the window and later summoning his car to appear at just the right moment as he jumps out of a window.  Some films will take a beating, Fast and Furious types that are very dependent on driving but meh. Does anyone really regret that there aren't many films where the main characters have to write a letter, use a phone box or ride a horse?"

SelfDrivingCars,3536ww,DukeOfGeek,2,Wed May 6 19:02:59 2015 UTC,"One issue with current busing, is that busing supports all the schools in an area. Because of that, the different schools - elementary, junior high, high school - have to start at different times so the buses can get back to the neighborhood for each group. SDCs or small self driving buses would help this issue, and all the schools could start at about the same time.   Parental supervision may be a problem, but install video cameras and that should minimize most behavior issues. As for choking, or other emergencies, this could still occur at home while the parent is in the other room. I'm not sure having an adult, especially if they are not trained (and I'm not sure how many bus drivers are trained in basic emergency medicine). If these self driving mini-buses are specific for students going to school, they could have emergency/drive to closest hospital buttons that a child would press in an emergency. This would probably be the best resolution to an emergency - i.e. drive to hospital or local EMT dispatch location. If EMT is dispatched, automatically coordinate meeting location so time is minimized."

The requirement for a separate receiver and base station can be eliminated by waiting longer for a position lock to eliminate the phase ambiguity by waiting for the satellites to move a reasonable distance around their orbit arc.  You need a more accurate clock to keep phase-accuracy for long enough to integrate a couple of chips to let you pick up signals ~10db below the noise floor, which practically means you need a clock with <200ppb, which is expensive.    One can trade off clock accuracy for two of longer lock time, more processing, or stronger signal requirements."

It is unclear whether Ms. Merkel acted on the request. Nokia is based in Espoo, Finland.  On April 29, Nokia executives discussed a potential sale of a majority stake in Here with negotiators representing the German car maker consortium, one person familiar with the talks said. The talks focused on price and on the concern of the German car makers that a sale of Here to a U.S. technology company could pose a competitive threat to European auto makers.  Another person familiar with those talks said the German car makers, a large customer of the Here service, threatened to stop using the service if it were sold to a company like Facebook or Uber Technologies Inc.

The classic Bus vs. Bike vs. Car graphic still applies here, and a light rail can hold 2 or 3 times as many people as a bus.  If you're trying to design a system to carry large volumes of people from point A to point B, mass transit is still the way to go - there's just no point in each person getting their own private 2 ton chariot to feed everyone into a dense city center.  SDC can replace the many to many transit of intra/inter suburban commuting reasonably well, and even take over the last mile of getting people from transit to their doorstep, but for a commute replacement, it just doesn't work."

Instead of the small cars like Google's or large ones like Mercedes, just a bunch of shuttles around the city, which would efficiently pick up people, and drop them off at needed locations. If somebody else can be picked up along the way, or slightly out of the way, great, grab them too. Basically a more efficient tram system.

SelfDrivingCars,34wr1u,michelework,2,Tue May 5 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"Removing the driver and the need to park still doesn't change that transporting people in bulk is more efficient than transporting people individually.

Select a destination, and a set of requirements (least number of transfers, shortest time, lowest cost, private cars only, disabled passenger, etc.), and it will map out how to get you to your destination most efficiently.  Self driving cars can play a part in the overall picture of transit, but they don't eliminate the need for bulk transport of people."

I somewhat agree. There are a lot of people here who vastly underestimate how long it takes for technologies to fully conquer markets. But there have been times in history when technology penetrated relatively quickly, smartphones come to mind. With my suggestion of inter city SDC mini buses, that should be a possibility relatively shortly after SDCs come online.

A shared fleet model offers significant financial savings compared with non autonomous private ownership.  I don't know what relevance you think Uber X has?

Couldn't agree more with regards to the physical dimensions of self-driving CARS.   Except they will be able to travel more closely if they are allowed to, and move in a more synchronised way through intersections. So that might increase road capacity in terms of people moved.  Plus if we promote shared automated vehicles (SAVs) and see average vehicle occupancy rise from around 1.2 now to 1.8 in the future then that would significantly increase road capacity to move people.  But are we limited to self-driivng CARS?... No, we are not. So we could 2-wheel, 2-person SAVS  that take up considerably less space. We could have SAV taxis with 4 private compartments that allow the discerning traveller more options - and would be much more efficient than 4 equivalent current taxis.  We could have SAVs that have 6,8, 10+ seats, automated buses.  All SAVs being capable of providing an on-demand door-to-door service, which during peak periods would be much less stressful than a private car, parking, fuel, maintenance etc.  And the more people that use SAVs, the higher average vehicle occupancy rises, the less vehicles on the road at a given time, then less congestion, less emissions (especially if electric which SAVs are very suited to) which means much more road capacity to move people.  So yes - there are a heap of things that mean self-driving VEHICLES will take up a lot less space on the road.   Btw - Baidu are working on self-driving bicycles that deliver themselves to you - and they will be much safer to ride in SAV traffic which could be programmed to give peds and bicyclists priority if we want. Also sidewalk friendly deliver-bots will be removing some of the delivery vehicles from the roads. All measures which could free up space on our roads."

SelfDrivingCars,34wr1u,submarinefacemelt,0,Tue May 5 23:38:29 2015 UTC,"Is there a shortage of space?  A road costs 1/10th as much as rail and we have plenty of space in most places to build roads. This makes it much easier to create transportation that goes close to where people actually want to go and prevents the need to travel in large groups which increases travel time and increases energy consumption when there are not enough people to completely fill large trains. The most affordable, fastest, energy efficient way to travel in most places is by car. This will only become more evident once cars are self-driving and shared fleets of small commuter pods can handle the majority of transportation as they will take up less space on the road and move faster through that space."

There are transport and access problems that exist right now, and if not addressed they will hurt economies and livelihoods. The best we can do at this early stage of a 'driverless' future, is continue to deliver mass transit solutions that make the best use of road space, and in doing so, design them so we don't ""build out"" the opportunity to switch to driverless in the future (if and when it comes)."
SelfDrivingCars,34wr1u,AbeRego,-2,Wed May 6 02:04:54 2015 UTC,The vast majority of jobs (80%+) in almost all cities are located in the suburbs. Most travel is suburb to suburb.

In terms of economic output though, in my country [Australia] at least, most productive jobs are in concentrated in the city centre, and the success of these jobs determines the success of other industries.   I'm all for equality of access, and I see the value in everything you are saying. Its just that the choice for policy makers isn't as clear cut as you make it out to be just yet. There are so still many unknowns, and at this time, mass transit remains an effective way to commute people using the road space we have now to many key employment destinations."

If these people can be persuaded by low cost shareable SDCs to move to urban environments without car ownership they will be potential mass transit users.

SelfDrivingCars,34tfgh,DarkKerrigor,3,Mon May 4 21:29:29 2015 UTC,"The general idea (first read my other comment) is that if the vehicle is satisfied with the information received, it will proceed and make a pro active adjustment. If not, it will do the opposite. Pro active being that you are signalling you are turning, your position and speed adjustment reflects that too, so the vehicle goes around. If one component is missing, just one. The vehicle will instead slow down and even come to a stop.   But just because you signal and the vehicle is pro active, doesn't mean you won't get hit. But if that were to happen there would be enough to satisfy a third party that you are at fault.   Either way, as a cyclist it would make no difference if you did or did not signal, to you personally. The only difference would be to the autonomous vehicle and passenger. You could have wasted a few seconds for them/it."

Really, trusting a hand signal to modify a driver's behavior in any manner is probably a bad idea. As a cyclist, to keep your ass in one piece it's better to just assume you're invisible to cars. Hand signals are kind of irrelevant, and worse, it involves sacrificing control by taking one hand off the bars precisely when executing a maneuver where control is of utmost importance.   Personally, I would rather have drivers thinking I'm fucking loco, because that way they'll perk up and pay attention when a cyclist is around. I'm not about to extend courtesy to drivers who feel they shouldn't have to be paying attention to what they're doing while driving. If my riding makes you nervous: Good. You ought to be.

If anything it will come under the category of ""New Fangled""  But what will happen is that people will see other people enjoying their driverless cars (asleep, texting, turned fully around and having a happy conversation) and realize that driving in traffic really sucks.  This will push the adoption rate through the roof as people quickly grow to resent driving. (except for the few who have cars ""built for driving"" such as Porsches and whatnot)  But then as more and more driverless cars make massive statistical  changes to the number of accidents it will be like when a disease is on the ropes and there is that huge vaccination push where people will realize that automobile deaths could be a thing of the past. Thus there will be a sudden(and actually rational) push for no manually driven cars.   At first people will think that the removal of manually driven cars is an insane infringement on their liberties but soon it will be up there with drinking and driving plus smoking inside public spaces. The stats will be clear that if you manually drive that you are the only risk to other people on the road. Thus manual driving will be equated to simply being sociopathic.  This will be pushed by people who lose loved ones in crashes with manually driven cars. They will be activist crusaders of the highest order.

People still want to drive and cars are seen as a status symbol - amongst older drivers, anyway.  There seems to be a demand for ownership of cars again by young people.  A better strategy would be co-existence on our roads, not 100% SDCs or 100% manual driven cars, but 50:50. After all, we still have horses on our roads, some Amish still ride them even today, as daily transport, not just enthusiast/hobbyist horseriders, and of course, police horses in the UK.  As for the point about automobile deaths, well, deaths can come from other things like power tools, electrocution etc. but you don't see anti-DIY crusaders do you? Alcohol can cause death, but if Prohibition was re-enacted, there'd be massive protests, wouldn't there? There's no reason to say deaths won't be stopped even with self-driving cars, after all, we have trains that are semi-automated, and people still commit suicide on the tracks, and children playing chicken on the roads.  The NRA and Internet privacy/ personal privacy activists and libertarians (non-capital L) have huge political power, what's to say that drivers won't as well? Even the police might complain about loss of revenue.  Plus, marques like Porsche, Lamborghini, Ferrari etc. aren't the brands who would need to sell an SDC, since they sell on speed and performance as their USP. I doubt few people would want an SDC Ferrari.  Perhaps will future car showrooms be more like that of boutiques, tailored service etc., rather than the way they are today?  Plus, I highly doubt people will be allowed to sleep/text at the wheel etc. with a driverless car - by law they may demand a driver, and a mode to revert it to manual driving if needs be. Not trying to disappoint people, but I read an article which mentioned about the reality of SDCs which said this is unlikely to happen, I can't remember the link though. Look at how people in the 1960s and 1970s envisaged the year 2000 and the reality of it - technologically things did change - Internet, safer cars, cable television, but not the futuristic world envisaged in Scooby-Doo, The Jetsons etc. Remember the Scooby and Scrappy-Doo episode Scooby-Doo 2000, which had these very things in?

It will definitely be a transition, but looking at how Google is skipping level 3 because the transition from automated to manual driving has some scary moments. Plus, as automation increases and there are fewer instances where a human would need to take over, they would probably both be out of practice and taking over in the most difficult circumstances.   This is probably how it's going to happen. We'll have a number of different technologies of varying levels on the road, and NHSTA will start collecting statistics showing the increased safety of these vehicles. The technology will improve and more people will start wanting these features. The full level 4 vehicles will cross the threshold of 5-10% on the road, and the statistics will be obvious. Social pressure will increase on manual drivers, and every instance of an accident with manual drivers will be shown on the news.

Do you think it will be a two-tier system; people driving on the roads for recreation, alongside SDCs? Would manufacturers like Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen, Opel become producers of recreational / aspirational products rather than cars as an appliance as people see them now?  We still live in a world where people use dial-up Internet, e.g. remote Africa, places where people can't get a signal for broadband, like High Wycombe, here in the UK.  There was a point made on here that SDC tech should be given to those who need it rather than want it, and that is a good point.  However, driving is a skill, and maybe we should try and encourage people to get into it again, the same way that today's youth have started to take up old hobbies - to quote a recent Daily Express article.  Where I live, there's no Uber, Lyft or car-sharing, it's either, drive, or use Merseytravel.  The desire for performance cars like a Ford Mustang or Ferrari is unlikely to go away, though, and I can't see people wanting an SDC Mustang or Ferrari, after all, the point of them is for driving ability and speed.  There are a lot of regulatory hurdles, in the UK and Europe at least, for full level 4 SDC vehicles."

Self-driving cars will make it easier, safer, and a little less destructive to the environment, but at the end of the day the infrastructure required to make a comprehensive car service requires that cities be built to serve cars and not people. This leads to the suburban hell-scape that most American cities have degenerated into. Parking lots instead of parks, superhighways instead of rail, sprawl instead of community. The entire image of the city has been smashed to bits and remade in the car's image, and people suffer for it.   I""m afraid it may be too late, an instance of path dependency, but American cities need to be designed for transit and habitation by humans instead of vehicles. Save the self driving cars and the high speed rail for the exception, not the rule. The technology is supposed to free us from traditional ownership, after all, and reduce the size of the overall fleet. Even if fuel is replaced with batteries, the energy problem only accounts for a third of global emmissions. Production makes up a huge chunk of the emissions output, and going nuclear or electric won't stop that. For a sustainable future, the required 90% reduction in 2010 levels of emissions that have only grown since then, production needs to be retooled exclusively to meet human needs, instead of surplus and profit. This requires, among other things, redesigned cities and re-imagined transportation solutions that follow a less-is-more mantra.   Driverless cars owned and utilized in an identical fashion to manual cars today are still a huge problem for a sustainable future, even after accounting for increased fuel efficiency.

Self-driving VEHICLES (SDVs) can take many forms and many operational and use cases - far more flexible than current cars/vehicles.  SDVs can be made to be our servant and not our master as they currently seem to have become in some of the more congested cities. We can set the rules so that pedestrians and cyclists have priority when SDVs are around if it suits us. We can regain quality of life by slowing SDVS down in walkable areas and moving to electric/low(or no) emission propulsion.  SDVs can be a much more efficient and cost-effective replacement for existing transit - being an on-demand and point to point service.  SDVs can provide much more affordable, accessible and equitable  transportation to the 30% that either can't drive or don't have a licence - including some that are disabled, seniors, too young, too old, too poor, medically-at-risk, unlicensed etc.  Let's not confine SDVs to our current way of thinking and the current paradigm - they offer so much more than that."

Demanding better performance than a human is and a human is nowhere near 99%. I don't trust an article that cites Google's fallback safety system as evidence that it's unsafe. Let that sink in for a moment when considering this 20th century ""we should fear the machines"" nonsense attitude."

True driving intelligence is another thing entirely, but the cost step is accepting that our cars, someday soon, will know things about driving that we didn't teach them.

SelfDrivingCars,34jmtz,theknowmad,10,Fri May 1 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"This is the classic trolley problem that has been discussed on here and every other forum I have been on.  The best answers I have heard are that the self-driving car will obey the law. Which means it won't leave the carriageway.  This will probably get reviewed by the courts/regulators/politicians, and if we don't like the answer that following the existing law gives us, then we will probably just change the law.  The philosophy side is really interesting, and will probably be really relevant one day.  But we have to ask ourselves if it is valid to delay the deployment of fully automated vehicles that could prevent maybe 80% of crashes because of concerns over tiny fraction of those crashes?"

SelfDrivingCars,34jmtz,TheAngryPlatypus,2,Sat May 2 18:16:44 2015 UTC,"Cars are unlikely to make any choices based on philosophy any time soon. It will likely do whatever results in the most likely chance of avoiding an accident, or at least reducing the impact. There will be times when we question if a SDC made the ""best"" choice, but that's OK. Overall they will be very good at avoiding accidents, and it's not like humans are good at making decisions in those situations either.   Over time, as we solve more relevant problems and move on to more trivial issues maybe things like that will be more directly addressed. For the present, while it may be fun to discuss in a philosophical sense, it's not particularly necessary from a practical standpoint. Things like that just don't happen very often, and will happen even more infrequently with autonomous vehicles."

Of course the car will slam on its brakes. But the hypothetical is that the car cannot stop in time; so there's going to be a collision.  Which is exactly what would happen if i were driving. I would do the best I can, but the reality is i'm not going to drive onto the sidewalk.  In the end it is an unfortunate accident. Because the car was autonomous doesn't change that."
SelfDrivingCars,34jmtz,Mr_Munchausen,2,Sat May 2 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"If swerving to avoid would cause a collision, the SDC would take the collision while attempting to stop.    Think of it as  programming logic , IF swerving will result in a collision, THEN do not swerve, ELSE swerve."
SelfDrivingCars,34jmtz,Woody117,2,Sat May 2 10:51:53 2015 UTC,"This question is so pointless.  If all cars were automated, one would never have swerved out of its lane into oncoming traffic in the first place.  You would only expect that from a human who is distracted, selfish, and unaware that traffic is stopped ahead.  An autonomous car can take in visual information from 360 degrees 100% of the time and also get information about traffic ahead reducing the likelihood of collisions to almost 0.  Humans as a whole are terrible drivers and the threshold to surpass us in terms of safety and efficiency is very low.  Autonomous cars will be so vastly safer compared to human drivers that the only unethical decision to be made here would be to have chosen not to be an an autonomous car in the first place."

SelfDrivingCars,34gkx7,userknamework,16,Fri May 1 01:38:03 2015 UTC,Also when a car drives it self it will never get angry and stomp on the gas and break.  So the repairs will still be less than even with the extra miles.

All of that was city driving and mostly back and forth along one major road across my city (outside of the downtown core thankfully). Compared yo driving almost the same distance in three hours on highways after I fueled up, which used up a bit over 1/4 of my fuel... The difference is annoying.

SelfDrivingCars,34gkx7,ehManiacal,8,Fri May 1 15:14:10 2015 UTC,"Actually 9% increase in road mileage by passenger vehicles will have negligible impact on road wear and tear. Most damage to road pavement is from the weather and heavily loaded axles (semi-trucks). A single heavy truck causes about 3,000 times more damage than a light passenger vehicle.  With fully self-driving vehicles suited for electric propulsion then the 9% increase shouldn't increase vehicle emissions."
SelfDrivingCars,34gkx7,userknamework,3,Fri May 1 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"They cause less damage than trucks, but the point was there will be more miles driven on the roads over the same time period. So it would be some amount of increased wear on the roads.   I was just pointing out that the amount is not really notable and certainly not worthy of being labelled a ""huge"" problem.   With fully self-driving vehicles suited for electric propulsion then the 9% increase shouldn't increase vehicle emissions.   I'd be curious to see what the relationship is between fewer cars driving more miles compared to more cars driving fewer miles. But yes, ideally these SDV fleets would use electricity for power.  A company that uses electric vehicles could feasibly also purchase a large array of solar or other renewable power generation methods and drastically reduce the cost of moving their vehicles."
SelfDrivingCars,34gkx7,recursive,3,Fri May 1 02:08:21 2015 UTC,"But it wouldn't. A 9% increase in use. But a heavy vehicle like a bus can cause 3,000 times more damage. There will be a significant decrease in larger vehicles such as buses. Think about it. If 3,000 cars drive down a road, they cause the same amount of road wear and tear as just one large vehicle. We could replace that 1 single vehicle with another 3,000 cars. A 100% increase and the damage will still be the same."

New commercial tech and government tech is usually developed first, and I believe it's exclusively the case when discussing anything with substantial development costs like this.

A single device up on top of the car as seen on the Google cars doesn't exactly look good but it's a necessity due to the high price of the device.  Put a couple in the front bumper corners and integrate one into the top of the windshield and they won't be too ugly and should achieve similar results.  Maybe I don't know enough about the tech but I would think you could get a better 3D image with more than one device anyway.

That's about 33 years from when it began as ARPANET, and evolved into the Internet we know today.

I have another photo of NY 5th Avenue in 1913 - it is packed full and if you look closely you can't find any horses - only lots and lots of automobiles.  The modern automobile was patented in about 1886 by Karl Benz.  So there is a precedent that rapid change can occur on our roads in only a few decades.  But bear in mind the compelling business case behind fully self-driving vehicles - that those who deploy them will likely gain market share (taxis, car rental, car share, ride share, TNCs [Uber, Lyft etc.)) and that those that don't will lose market share.  Then of course the couch entrepreneur can buy one and hire it out through the cloud.  Then there is the fact that one fully self-driving vehicle can replace anywhere from 2 to 13 private vehicles, and so unlike when the horse and carriage was replaced 1-for-1 we will see massively leveraged market penetration here.  There are at least another dozen compelling reasons/business cases why demand to deploy fully self-driving cars will be much greater than the ability to supply them.  Personally - I think most assessments of market penetration rates are way too cautious. Because if replacing only 10% of cars means that fully self-driving vehicles can do anywhere from 20% to 100% of the work on the road network, and we have total fleet turnover of about 6% per year....

The Lidar on the Google cars costs $80,000 each. Those units are hand-built. Ours are manufacturable products built to automakers’ requirements.”  Quanergy says its first solid-state Lidar units will cost only $250 to OEM carmakers.

You don't need to get $50,000+ together to buy an SDC, you just pay per mile or however they plan on charging people. This means once autonomous cars are ready for the market, fleet managers are going to get them out on the roads as fast as they can. The biggest hurdle will be the supply of SDCs, followed by SDCs for different purposes. People that are wheelchair bound will need vehicles with elevators or ramps.  After unemployment, the second biggest issue will be the 230+ million vehicles now sitting around doing nothing.

People do want to drive, however, it's convincing the next generation to drive that's the hard part.  Cars will probably be sold for recreational purposes, instead of as an appliance/tool, as some see them now. That may be a workaround of problems affecting the auto industry.  We may have to look at a coexistence strategy for both manual cars and SDCs to coexist peacefully on the roads.

SelfDrivingCars,34143r,walky22talky,17,Mon Apr 27 14:02:37 2015 UTC,"This type of immediate switchover capability will never work. After all the whole point of the SDC is the to remove the stress of driving from the driver. That by definition means the driver would be paying less attention and could not be replied upon to get a car out of an emergency situation. Either these cars can handle those situations themselves or they should not be allowed on the road.  The solution is to have a definitive handoff of control between the driver to the car. Once that handoff is done the drive should be out of the loop and not only not expected to intervene but prevented from doing so with the possible exception of breaking to stop the car.   This design allows SDCs to become a reality sooner because it allows them to take control under situations that are easy to automate, like highway driving, while leaving the more difficult situations to be handled later. But once again, until a car can handle all driving tasks in a situation it should not be allowed to take total control in that situation."

SelfDrivingCars,34143r,SplitReality,5,Mon Apr 27 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"Autonomous driving will certainly progress in small increments, as it has already. It's started with cruise control, then gone on to collision avoidance (auto-braking), adaptive cruise control/radar following, lane keeping assist, blind spot monitoring, and soon active lane keeping/lane changing. That's all that's needed for full highway autonomy. But I think it will probably retain an immediate override if you grab the wheel or hit the brake, the same way cruise control self-cancels with certain driver inputs.   From there, I don't think the same progression will carry from highway autonomy to partial surface street autonomy. I think SDC tech will take a big step to full point-to-point autonomy, where a car can literally park itself, pick up the kids, etc."

We'll have to see how this goes but I think that could be the step too far. The problem is that once you let the car handle full steering then you have to expect that the drive will become distracted from the act of driving. There will no doubt be accidents cause by users inadvertently gaining control of the car and that is not going to make for good headlines.   I can see why it is happening though. It does just seem like a natural progression of what has already come before. The difference is that there is a huge difference between the car controlling only part of the driving process, and the car controlling the entire process. You simply can't rely on the diver in the second scenario."

Also, datalogging should largely shield automakers from false accusations of auto-control malfunctions when they can show data of driver input or, even possibly visible/IR video of the driver's actions."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,davidrools,3,Mon Apr 27 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can get around the fact that the more thresholds you put in place to prevent an accidental bump, the less useful actually gaining the wheel would be in an emergency. Besides its not a bump that I'm worried about. People are already putting on makeup while driving. Imagine what they will be doing if they don't have to actively steer. It's that increased exotic activity that is promoted by cars that steer themselves that I'm really worried about.  Also I was not worried about the automaker's liability for a driver accidentally taking control of a car, although that is a good point. I was worried about the public relations disaster that would follow such an accident. Imagine the outrage that would happen if someone was asleep at the wheel, does the equivalent of sleepwalking, and grabs the wheel disengaging the system. The following fact alone should give you pause.   Scientists interviewed 15,929 Americans ages 18 and older from 15 states. Participants were asked questions about their sleeping habits, general health, medications taken and mental disorders. In the study, 30 percent had a history of sleepwalking. Of those, 3.6 percent reported sleepwalking at least once in the past year.

SelfDrivingCars,34143r,davidrools,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:37:16 2015 UTC,"What makes anyone think that a human could make a better accident avoidance maneuver than a computer, whether or not he's paying attention? Humans simply can't possess the field of vision, the reaction time, or the amount of data that a computer can. And considering the vast majority of accidents come from driver impairment or driver error, removing the driver seems to be the most logical way to reduce the number of accidents.   Even early SDC technology is far superior to most drivers. Assuming the computer can't be sleepy or drunk or high or distracted, what scenario do you envision an SDC possibly not being able to handle?   I agree there has to be a definitive handoff, but I disagree though that the driver should be prevented from controlling the vehicle after that handoff is made. There's no reason I shouldn't be able to switch back control to take a detour or just manually drive if I want to. The brake is the handoff mechanism now for cruise control, and considering SDC technology is an enhanced form of cruise control that handoff should logically stay the same.  Edit: Actually, a second point of response may be needed just to avoid the accidental brake push. Maybe it will work like the cars with the push button ignitions where you have to hit the brake and the button at the same time. Maybe tap the gas/brake while you hold a button on the steering wheel so the car knows your foot and hand are both engaged."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,sweetmoses,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"My point wasn't that you couldn't ever regain control. It was that it would not be immediate and would require some type of handoff procedure. You couldn't just grab the steering wheel and start turning. A handoff procedure would be needed to ensure that the driver really intended to take control of the vehicle and that it wasn't an inadvertent movement of the steering wheel.  Once you accept that such a handoff procedure must be in place then you also have to accept that a driver could never be able to take control of the car back in a timely manner in an emergency situation. Therefore the car must be able to handle all emergency situations without input from the driver.  It takes 4.6 seconds to stop a car going 60 mph on dry roads with 1.5 seconds of that due to the driver's perception and reaction time. All of that is with the assumption that the driver is actually driving the vehicle. The perception and reaction time would be a lot higher for someone not actively engaged in driving. Then when you add in a handoff procedure, the car could have stopped on its own before a driver could have possibly taken control.  Even if there was enough time, like might be possible in rain (still doubtful at 6.1 seconds to stop) and snow (10.6 seconds to stop), the idea that a driver could interrupt an emergency maneuver and do something useful from a cold start without any sense of the car's current handling is extremely unlikely. The far better thing to do would be to let the car try to deal with the situation and stop itself.

It was that it would not be immediate and would require some type of handoff procedure.    Oh, I agree with that. I think the car has to know that your hand and foot are both engaged, and it possibly even needs to check that your eyes are on the road. But I think that could happen at any time during the trip.   Once you accept that such a handoff procedure must be in place then you also have to accept that a driver could never be able to take control of the car back in a timely manner in an emergency situation.    Well, right. We already accepted that fact with ABS braking. The computer is already controlling your rate of braking in an emergency situation. Has been for decades.   Then when you add in a handoff procedure, the car could have stopped on its own before a driver could have possibly taken control.   Yes. The human shouldn't be able to do anything in an emergency situation. It's most likely that the computer wouldn't get into an emergency situation in the first place being that most accidents come from human error or impairment. There's also mechanical failure, but that's mostly due to human neglect. The computer already tells you when the tire pressure is low and could disable itself or ""limp"" in such cases. It wouldn't, for instance, have a blowout on the highway because it wouldn't be traveling at highway speeds to begin with.   The far better thing to do would be to let the car try to deal with the situation and stop itself.   I agree.

SelfDrivingCars,34143r,StarMagnus,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:19:19 2015 UTC,The problem we're talking about is not the driver taking control when he wants to it's about having to take control when the car wants them to and they're not paying attention.    So what if they're not paying attention? Then the car won't hand over control until they are.   Do you remember about the people that set cc in their rvs and then got up thinking the rv would just keep driving straight?   I think you're thinking about Anchorman 2. Anybody that's that dumb shouldn't have a license. It's not cruise control's fault.
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,sweetmoses,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:13:53 2015 UTC,Um the whole point of the car handing control back is because it can't handle part of the road so delaying will likely mean losing control of the car on top of which there really isn't the technology for a computer to tell when the person is paying attention. A large part of the article was how much trouble they're having giving the person enough notice to take over in time.  I agree there are a lot of people that shouldn't have licenses which is a large part of why I support SDC. Unfortunately a license is really easy to get and most people consider themselves better than average drivers so we don't find out who shouldn't have one until after they've caused some serious damage. It's not a gun's fault it's used to hurt people but that doesn't mean everybody should have access to one or that we should get rid of guns. It's more about finding the correct solution.
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,StarMagnus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"Um the whole point of the car handing control back is because it can't handle part of the road   But this is predictable. In what scenario wouldn't the car know that it's headed for a part of the road it can't handle?    delaying will likely mean losing control of the car on top of which there really isn't the technology for a computer to tell when the person is paying attention.   Yeah, I mean I agree with you that it would be impossible to immediately switch control from the computer to the human. That wouldn't happen. There's no guarantee the human even knows what's going on to make any decision about what to do next, let alone the correct decision.  Say you have to go off road or it starts snowing while you're driving. The car could pull over while alerting the human to take control before it gets into a situation that it can't handle.  I agree with you about licenses and guns."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,sweetmoses,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:16:45 2015 UTC,The whole point of level three is that the human is expected to take over at a moments notice because it's not programmed for all eventualities. Like if the car's going 60 down a highway with no shoulder and hit's a washed out portion a level three SDC would just hand control back to the human to navigate and the person wouldn't have the time to orientate themselves before hitting the problem. If you're talking about using an SDC only in circumstances that it could give the human enough time to react because it's dealing only with the predictable that's like level two or lower.
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,StarMagnus,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"The whole point of level three is that the human is expected to take over at a moments notice because it's not programmed for all eventualities.   Not necessarily at a moment's notice. At will maybe, but there's no reason the car can't pull over or slow down until the handoff is successful.    Like if the car's going 60 down a highway with no shoulder and hit's a washed out portion a level three SDC would just hand control back to the human to navigate and the person wouldn't have the time to orientate themselves before hitting the problem.   Then it would slow down or stop. Why would the car just keep driving if it knows it can't drive in a certain condition? That's just not logical.   If you're talking about using an SDC only in circumstances that it could give the human enough time to react because it's dealing only with the predictable that's like level two or lower.   Level 3 dictates that it will hand over control in certain circumstances like we're discussing. I just don't understand why you think the car will just keep driving 60mph if that handoff process doesn't happen."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,sweetmoses,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of reasons a car can't just stop or pull over. What if there's no place for the car to pull over?  In my example I said no shoulder stopping in the middle of a highway is very dangerous. What about when there's not enough time for car or person to react. Liability issues aside, most accidents occur because something happens and the driver doesn't have enough time to react like by stopping. What happens when the car suddenly finds itself in a situation it can't react to? Slam on the brakes? A controlled stop? or just transfer control?"
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,StarMagnus,3,Wed Apr 29 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"Until cars can drive themselves 100% of the time, you control the car, but the car won't let you crash. I don't understand why people are trying to come up with clever ways of letting a car drive itself only part of the time, only for a person to take control at a random time they can't possibly know about until it's too late for them to take control."

They read that SDCs can't handle inclement weather and think, ""stupid computers, I drive in inclement weather all the time"" and don't realize that the issue is that the SDC's problem is not one of ability.  It's one of safety and impaired vision... the stuff a self-assured human driver can use magical thinking to overcome."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,Calamity_Jesus,2,Tue Apr 28 13:17:06 2015 UTC,You expect that self-driving cars will be common where one is allowed complete control in 5 years?

I think common will take 10-15 years of sales, mostly because of how long older vehicles stay on the road."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,amazingmrbrock,2,Mon Apr 27 17:38:24 2015 UTC,That sounds like a reasonable estimate of the timeline.
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,JoshuaZ1,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Average car age is 11.4 years in the U.S. Unless that changes as people really want to switch over to SDCs and they're available in the next 5 years, you're highly unlikely to have most vehicles at SDC 4 in 15 years. To add to that, the list of car manufacturers that will have SDCs in 5 years is   By 2020, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Nissan, BMW, Renault, Tesla and Google all expect to sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time.   Note that it's part of the time, not all the time. It also doesn't mean that every model they release will be SDC. Also that doesn't even include some of the biggest car manufacturers.  Personally, I'd be happy if there was a full SDC available for sale in the next 4 years. Highway might be possible in 2, but I have my doubts."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,strike2867,3,Mon Apr 27 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the average car age is 11.4 years under current circumstances. Those circumstances won't continue to exist.   For example there is currently no automated car subscription service alternative to owning a car. If your car breaks down now, if you want to keep the same mobility you can either fix your car or get a replacement one. The cost of getting a replacement car is usually high enough that fixing your car is the desired option. However if a third option existed that allowed you to keep or improve your mobility and get a chauffeur service on top while lowering or maintaining your monthly car expenses, then you'll be far less likely to keep your car for 11.4 years.  Another change in circumstances is that electric cars will continue to get cheaper to make and operate while oil prices will go back up. At some point the high operating cost alone for a gas car will cause people to want to switch out their cars sooner."
SelfDrivingCars,34143r,SplitReality,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:44:51 2015 UTC,"While both of those things may be true, I don't imagine them happening enough to change most cars in the next 10-15 years."

We have companies like Google and others saying they'll have SDCs within about 5 years. We also have Google and Uber saying that they are going to implement self driving car services. Elon Musk has said that he doesn't even really consider SDCs a particularly difficult problem to solve now.  We of course have a history with high gas prices so that's not at stretch. The price of rechargeable batteries, the most expensive part of an electric car, has not only had a consistent rate of price reduction, but that rate has gotten faster in recent years."

Also, let's not forget, despite the proliferation of technology upgrades, there's still a lot of people on Windows 98 and even Windows 95, some areas of the world still use dial-up, and retrocomputing is popular.  So it looks like SDCs have a fair few obstacles to overcome yet."

SelfDrivingCars,34143r,axc86,0,Wed Apr 29 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"I love these non issues. Either self driving will or won't be able to drive independently. If it can then people will trust it so much that they will close the curtains and go to sleep. Or it can't and it will never be put into cars. If it can't and people put it into cars then everyone would just have nervous breakdowns waiting for it to screw up. Try driving through a rotary with a brand new learner driver. So handing control to a human driver so they can do something like go through tall grass that the car refuses to do will be something where it is about an easy problem to solve as possible. You need a tiny handful of rules such as don't do it on highways, don't do it at high speed, don't do it unless the user has clearly indicated that they are willing to take the conn.  So maybe a few extra technologies will be needed so that if an accident does happen (road collapses, car breaks down in the middle of the road etc) then a signal can be issued to all cars in the area that something is up and everyone will slow down to speeds where manual control is available and thus they can steer around a problem using their judgement. This could be used for construction as well.   I think the biggest non issue fear mongering that I have heard so far was that gang bangers will use self driving cars for drive by shooting and that terrorists will use them for car bombs. The answer is that yes they will... just like they do now."

The way they propose to do it, the SDC uses a cost function to determine whether to accelerate, decelerate, or change lanes. The cost function optimizes progress, comfort, safety, and fuel consumption (see claim 7). It also models the merging vehicle's intent using a Bayesian approach. For a patent, it's very specific.  Of course, there's no way to know if GM is actually using or planning to use this. Their cost function seems close to Google's risk assessment patent, which estimates the expected risks and potential benefits of any SDC maneuver. I imagine most approaches will use cost/benefit analysis in a similar way."
SelfDrivingCars,33z3gl,drumstyx,3,Mon Apr 27 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"Common courtesy is to move over for them if you can safely. Essentially you are passing them, visualizing that they intend to be in the right lane with you, but you'll be going faster than them.

SelfDrivingCars,33z3gl,FountainsOfFluids,3,Mon Apr 27 14:26:32 2015 UTC,"Are you assuming that the merging car is about to crash into you? Usually the merging car adjusts to find a space if you maintain a constant speed. If they are going too slow and merge in front of you, you apply the brakes. If they are right beside you and are going to hit you, you apply the brakes and possibly swerve to the side. Otherwise you let them do their thing, since it doesn't affect you.  SDCs will pretty much do the same thing that an intelligent safe driver would do, only much faster and more precise."

As we know, there are already prototypes operating and demonstrating this technological feat. However, there are still a significant number of people that oppose the idea of a driverless car. It amazes me that despite of the endless applications of this advancement, some individuals believe that this will “ruin” the auto industry and threaten society. On the contrary, I believe the exact opposite to be true. Driverless cars embody an opportunity for the auto industry to better serve the consumer by making transportation easier and safer. I can hardly listen to the radio in my car without hearing an advertisement for another safe driving campaign. Whether it’s caused by distracted driving or driving under the influence, about 30,000 lives are cut short in the United States each year. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla Motors & SpaceX weighed in by saying, “People may outlaw driving cars because it’s too dangerous.

With brakes other drivers are reacting to what you do. They are not reacting to you say you are going to do.   Part of the efficiency gains from SDCs comes from them being able to talk to one another and coordinate better. Doing so they could drive much closer together and not have to stop when going through an intersection. If you make a change in this coding you are very likely to reduce the overall efficiency of the system and if mistakes are made you are likely to cause an accident.  Also note that SDC software will likely have to go through extensive tests to be certified safe for public use. A person changing the software would invalidate that certification. So while I could see a case being made that you should be able to modify your car, such a modified car should not be legally able to drive on the public roads, and mechanisms should be in place to instantly identify such cars to prevent this."

SelfDrivingCars,33ppnx,SplitReality,-1,Sat Apr 25 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"should it be illegal for you to modify something you own? IMO no. but if you fuck up, then you should be liable.   That factors into the liability insurance situation.  Liability insurance w/ SDC factory software...  $50/year.  Liability insurance with untested modded software...  $2000/year.  Cost of proper testing...  $50k (if it doesn't require destructive hardware tests)."
SelfDrivingCars,33ppnx,Ambiwlans,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"There are ways to verify code on start up, so if that mechanism fails, maybe the SDC components won't work. People brick their phones when trying to root them, so this could be similar."
SelfDrivingCars,33ppnx,Deadeye00,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see how SDC features are different than anything else for a car in terms of insurance.  A car maker makes a set of promises for their product within certain bounds, and is liable within those bounds. For example, if brakes on your car fail, they are liable. But if you didn't install the brakes properly or they are worn beyond coverage, you are viable.  SDCs easily fit in the same way. If you modify it, the liability is voided and you are on your own. If the vehicle crashes despite you keeping up with maintenance etc, then they are liable.  It is pretty simple.... I honestly don't get why this is being made out to be a problem when it changes nothing."
SelfDrivingCars,33ppnx,Mr_Munchausen,2,Sat Apr 25 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"It's not about insurance. It is about the safety and efficiency of the overall network of cars. SDCs will be designed to talk to one another and coordinate their actions. Changing this code would be more like allowing people to change the code controlling a traffic light than allowing people to change their brakes.  In addition, SDC software will likely have to go through a certification process to allow it to be used on public roads. Changing any part of that code would invalidate that certification. So any SDC with modified code should not be considered a street legal vehicle. Security mechanisms should be in place to instantly identify such vehicles and notify other vehicles around it as well as the authorities."

SelfDrivingCars,33ppnx,nywhitesox,2,Fri Apr 24 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"Why would they care though, they'd not be liable. People can cut their brakes and kill people just as dead. More likely they want to keep control over their shit so they can keep charging money, just under the veil of safety.  I think this is similar to the whole nuclear waste debate.... which only exists in the US because it is an invented issue made to benefit nuclear weapons production I guess."

Didn't car makers wanted to equate working on your car with hacking, punishable under the DMCA?   Yea they did and as far as I can tell it didn't succeed. Doesn't really matter anyway. What is Ford going to do? Sue me because I fix my car myself in my driveway? It's never going to happen.

SDCs by themselves don't do that much to reduce the demand for cars. Yes, assuming a large percentage of people opt for shared fleet service over privately owned vehicles it can reduce the number of cars on the road at any given time dramatically. But as those cars are used much more heavily they wear out much quicker as well.   You reduce the number of cars that have to be manufactured by either increasing the number of miles vehicles last, or decreasing the number of miles people travel. Whether a car is used for 200,000 miles in 2 years in a shared fleet before being scrapped or 200,000 miles over 20 years by a single driver is irrelevant to how many cars you have to manufacture.   It's true there are some factors that may allow shared fleet vehicles to last somewhat longer, and if ride sharing takes off it could reduce the effective number of miles people travel, but not to the degree to put an entire industry out of business. It's also quite possible people will actually travel more with the advent of self driving vehicles, which would be a factor for increasing demand for vehicles.   Now I have no doubt some auto manufacturers won't be able to effectively make the transition, but we're still going to need a lot of cars."
SelfDrivingCars,33nqd9,TheAngryPlatypus,0,Fri Apr 24 16:46:34 2015 UTC,Taxis last many many more miles than an average vehicle due to better maintenance. SDCs could also drive in a 'low wear' fashion.  I suspect that electric cars will be the big one though for lifespan changes.
SelfDrivingCars,33nqd9,Ambiwlans,2,Fri Apr 24 21:38:38 2015 UTC,"I've searched and I can't find anything that blows me away with how long taxis last. I will concede it's difficult to find good info, as taxis are usually sold off rather than scrapped which makes finding their total lifetimes difficult.   Current taxis also benefit because the internal combustion engine lasts longer when it's constantly run as opposed to the short trips typical of privately owned vehicles. Combine that with the fact that electric vehicles should require less maintenance in general, and the fact that when cars are smart and self driving and you can tap a button on your phone to send your car for an oil change while you're at work and I don't see maintenance being a huge factor.   There are other minor issues as well, which is why I said they don't do much to reduce demand (also reduced accidents, reduced theft, etc) rather than that they don't do anything. The problem is some people seem to think that because one taxi can ""replace"" 10 privately owned vehicles it means we need 90% less cars. That's nowhere close to the case."

The biggest problem I could see would be body odor and cigarette smoke. Someone could really stink up a taxi with there being no way to automatically detect it. Although it'd be pretty easy to detect who is responsible if you gave a simple way for passengers to report problems with the taxi before the get in. That taxi could be automatically routed for inspection/clean up and another taxi could be called to replace it.

I understand the Association of American Automakers' reasoning ""that the bill might create state-specific standards related to safety or manufacturing that could tap the brakes on the development of the technology"".    Perhaps Google is presently knee-deep in state-specific regulatory issues in California and they're waiting to see how that works out before jumping into another state's conditions for their own car.  We'll have to see if this Google opinion gets replicated in other states that are considering AV legislation."
SelfDrivingCars,33h16z,nywhitesox,3,Wed Apr 22 14:40:07 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, the automakers have been asking states to hold off on special legislation for now. All the testing they want to do with a human in the car is completely legal today, and adding regulations (especially state-by-state) just creates work for them. New regulations might also require accident data reporting as in California, which I'm sure they'd prefer to avoid.   Google was opposed for the same reasons. Additionally they oppose because the new regulations require a licensed driver, when Google want to test full driverless. Google supported previous legislation in Nevada for two reasons:    Google wasn't working on full driverless at the time. Those regulations required that testing be performed on current model year cars, which hurt the automakers who prefer to test on vehicles that are still in development."

Go to an amusement park, or in the future go to a private track where you can drive like that. Go daily if that's what you need for fulfillment - people have probably only felt the acceleration we feel in these vehicles for the last 50-100 years, so I don't believe it is a necessity of the human experience.    You're not accelerating in traffic, you're doing it when there are fewer cars.   I've seen plenty folks jump off the line when they are first at a stop light or on empty roads. There are also instances of people driving off the road in a rural setting.    Yes, on the rare occasions that I need to, I can tow an 18 wheeler.   Highly inefficient, unnecessary, and has probably only occurred in very, very, limited circumstances, and those circumstances will be less frequent in the future. It is not the primary need of the powerful engine in the vehicle. It is mostly to accelerate faster then other vehicles (and I guess so you feel you are on a roller coaster)   if the SDC has an option for extremely aggressive driving, especially if it can be hacked not to follow the speed limits too closely   This will be highly restricted and void any warranty/insurance that would legally protect the driver. One would probably see very high jail time in this scenario in the few years after SDCs hit the road, and the laws/politics are worked out. Hacked vehicles may exist, but they will quickly be isolated due to how they impact normal networked vehicles. Reckless driving will have a much lower threshold for penalty and much higher penalty as the technology is deployed.   Fully networked vehicles will actually be able to travel at much higher speeds then humans, but they still will not be weaving in and out of lanes and cutting other vehicles off because it will not be necessary. Lane changes will be planned in advance and all vehicles will be going at the correct speed for the lane they are in. Left lanes will be the fastest, and right lanes will be the slowest instead of the mish-mash we see now.    Or if you can take the wheel for a while to have some fun. Is it safe, probably not, but neither are a bunch of other sports.   DUI laws have shown that safety > impaired driving. Humans will be considered impaired compared to computer based driving. If you want to drive in full manual mode, you will be required to go to a track environment where you can have the fun you want. Also, most other sports don't kill others not participating in said sport, so I don't think that is a good argument."

Wheelchair taxis bring in approximately 7 or 8 per cent overall taxi income per year [$80 to $90 million AUD]. As public transport and driving are not options for these people, they are highly dependent on taxis and other point to point services. If point to point access could be automated, these people would not be reliant of poor drivers skills and knowledge, low availability of vehicles, exploitation and fraud, and competition for high occupancy fares.       Driverless technology also has the potential to drastically change the design of vehicles as bulky safety technology is removed and replaced with interiors that facilitate other activities, work, relaxation etc. It is likely that Governments, cities and even ride-share providers who own commercial or public fleets will be subject to disability access requirements for their vehicles. This will compel the development of vehicles that are accessible to most people, ranging from those with wheelchairs, people with luggage to mothers with prams. This is already possible in vehicles like the London cab.       There is a commercial aspect for this too, people with disabilities represent a segment of the society that would like to travel more, but physically can't because they are restricted by the built environment.

SelfDrivingCars,333kov,PaulGodsmark,5,Sun Apr 19 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious that a large decline in car ownership will decrease the overall market, so a lot of today's manufacturers won't make it. If private car ownership becomes the exception rather than the rule, the car market would shrink to a fraction of what it is today. So yeah, those guys are in for a rocky ride."
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,Diplomjodler,5,Sun Apr 19 14:51:13 2015 UTC,I'm unconvinced. Taxi and rental companies today foot a major section of the market. On top of that you're going to see major resistance from the portion of the U.S. that wants to drive.   I find it hard to believe in a huge drop in sales.
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,flagcaptured,5,Sun Apr 19 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Right now, during peak times, about 30% of all cars are actually moving. On average, a car spends 90% of its time parked. So, if you assume 100% utilisation, we could do with 70% fewer cars. Even less, if we manage traffic more intelligently. There are obviously no hard data on this, so any prognosis is mostly speculation. But a substantial reduction is very likely, IMO.   As for car enthusiasts, yes, the hold-outs will hold out. But car ownership is declining among the urban young already. The first generation that grows up with SDCs will view drivers as old-fashioned fuddy-duddies. Also, once SDCs are demonstrably safer than human drivers, the pressure on drivers will increase in the form of stricter training requirements etc."

But my comment was agreeing with and adding to /u/oversized_hoodie's comment, namely that 100% utilization isn't realistic.  In other words, there are going to be different times during the day when there are dramatic differences in the number of people wanting a ride. So you either have enough cars to fill the demand when it's at its peak (and have a lot of idle cars otherwise) or you have less cars than are needed at peak times and have less idle cars during the day (but have wait times during peak load).  All that to say, my money is on having enough cars (if not more) to fill peak demand, so the thought that car companies are going to lose 70% of their sales volume is incorrect, IMO."

Generally everyone in the morning wants to go from residential areas to commercial areas, the cars get to drive back empty for each customer. What if you end up with 50 cars on the westside and 0 on the eastside during rush hour? What type of wait times are we going to allow for?  I doubt we'll particularly see much fewer cars. 20% less perhaps? Over 30 years, so emerging markets will overpower this slip.

SelfDrivingCars,333kov,TheAngryPlatypus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:46:28 2015 UTC,"That would assume that cars are always replaced after a fixed mileage. I think that's unlikely. Taxis tend to run up higher mileages than private cars today already. There'll be a strong incentive to keep it that way for whoever runs the fleets. Private cars, OTOH, usually have a limited lifespan due to lack of maintenance. Car manufacturers also skimp on quality to keep prices down. Fleet operators will place far more emphasis on quality and durability. So yes, there will be fewer cars on the road and they will last longer."
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,Diplomjodler,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"Taxis tend to run up higher mileages than private cars today already.    Not that much longer from what I've seen, and a large part of that is that the internal combustion engine benefits from an ""always on"" duty cycle. This is not a factor with electric vehicles, which I believe will be in wide use by the time self driving vehicles also command a significant share of the market.   The other big reason is fleet vehicles are usually impeccably maintained compared to privately owned vehicles. That's not directly an impact of self driving cars though, and while that factor isn't likely to go away it may be reduced when your car can drive itself to the shop while you're at work or sleeping. Again, electric vehicles require less maintenance in general, which may have an impact.   Also all we can do is guess what percentage of the market will be replaced by fleet service. Many of the factors have no impact at all if the self driving car is privately owned, and that will undoubtedly account for at least part of the market.   Finally we have to account for the very real possibility people may travel substantially more with self driving cars.   Bottom line, while there are lots of factors that could have an impact, it's very difficult to conclude there will be any significant reduction in the number of cars that will be manufactured and sold at this point."
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,TheAngryPlatypus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"All the factors you have cited seem to me to point to a big reduction in the overall market for cars. But you're right, nobody knows at this point in time."

SelfDrivingCars,333kov,TheAngryPlatypus,2,Mon Apr 20 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"The decline will come in waves with the first few waves actually being a boon to the car industry.   The first wave will be when people start replacing good cars with driverless cars before they would otherwise have replaced those cars. This will only grow as the cars become more widely recognized as a brilliant idea.  Then there will be a few more bursts while the cars dramatically improve, not only in their self driving abilities but as cars that are self driving start to change in their very nature and adapt to this new reality (I am thinking mobile livingrooms).  Another wave of buyers will be those presently denied driving, the blind, the old, the too young, the disabled, and those who's legal difficulties (drinking) have caused them to lose their licence.   Then there will be one last orgy sized wave when manual cars start to become recognized as the cause of pretty much all road suffering and are first shunned and then banned. (Think cigarettes on airplanes in the 70s).  But once manual cars are largely off the roads the whole game becomes instantly worse. For one cars instantly become far easier to build as they shed much of the safety gear that presently weighs down modern cars. This is not only hard to build but hard to get approved. Then there is the fact that old school designers will have trouble wrapping their heads around the overall design of the driverless car. For this look at the days of cellphones just before the iPhone; there were literally about 2 dozen fundamental designs with flips, slides, rotates, dual screens, etc But then once the iPhone came out pretty much every company went touch screen slab. The key takeaway was that nearly all the unstoppable giants were slain that day; Motorola, Nokia, Blackberry, etc. All pretty much now dead with the phone industry nobody Apple now king.  With the simpler vehicle it becomes fantastically easier for a tiny upstart to design a radically new vehicle. And when I say tiny upstart again I mean either a company that gets bought by a technology giant or a tiny department in a technology giant. Apple is rumoured to have a car in the works but it literally could be almost anyone who realizes that they have the correct solution. It won't come early in the game but it will come just as the old school auto makers are sitting pretty on all these new sales because they are coming up with exciting new designs every year that are driving sales hard. Then voop, all their sales will fly over to a single new company and they are all pretty much instantly dead. They might make their also-rans but they will probably look at the new design and say, ""Pfshaw that won't work, people don't want that."" and will be slow to realize that they must copy the design as fast as is humanly possible.   My last prediction is also predicated that this new design will be an electric car, in that many cars will be electric by this time but it also massively simplifies the design and assembly. This would allow this upstart to pound out millions of these vehicles shockingly fast.  Then there is the whole concept of even owning a vehicle. If taxis/rentals are driverless then why own a vehicle that you will call to your location if you can just call a fleet car? Right now with a taxi you are calling an expensive vehicle where you have to pay a driver, but not only for the driver's time while they drive you but potentially their time on a return journey and you actually have to factor in their waiting time into the price of the drive. With driverless cars you will be getting into a very cheap vehicle with no driver. With these fleet vehicles most people won't care which brand of machine they get into as long as it is clean and reliable. This will massively damage the ""My vehicle is better and thus makes me better than you"" marketing. I am not saying that nobody will own cars but it would again be like smoking in that the numbers will plummet and keep dropping for a very long time until it is narrowed down to those who just can't give up private ownership.  So in summary, the next decade or so will be called the golden age of car sales, but the next decade after that will have kids asking, ""What was a Ford again?"""
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,LessonStudio,2,Mon Apr 20 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"Although, incidentally, things like retrocomputing and vinyl records have become popular these days, so the ""What was a Ford again?"" question might not be that in the next decade (maybe?)"
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,axc86,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:24:58 2015 UTC,Popular in the media but not an economic reality.   The moment I am waiting for is when manually driven cars are in the process of being banned. Basically anyone defending their right to drive a manually driven car will be viewed as someone who is defending their right to fire their gun randomly in crowded public spaces.

SelfDrivingCars,333kov,axc86,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:06:38 2015 UTC,The force that I see bringing in self driving cars will be parents of dead children. It won't take many self driving cars on the road to make strong statistical argument that way fewer people would die with 100% self driving cars. Thus anyone with a loved one killed in a car accident will be a potential lobbying force to reckon with. Think MADD.   The car companies will probably somewhat fight it but the instant gratification will probably be too tempting. But insurance companies and the entire traffic law enforcement world will see it as the devil made real. Yet I suspect that they are going to do such a ham handed anti-SDC campaign that it will have the opposite effect. I see a day when they have a commercial where they have a highway patrolman trying to be portrayed as a hero-of-the-highway with a family instead of highwayman/predator who probably has anger management issues and beats his family like he really is.  But when it really starts going what could actually kill the manually driven car would be the tort legal system. That they will end up winning on the concept that manually driving a car is recklessly dangerous. Right now that would be madness because we don't have a real self driving option. But when they are common and mostly within everyone's price range that will change.

Labor Agility is incredibly important when you want a workforce to move from a ""sunset market"" to a ""sunrise market"", it's certainly happened before, but 20 years is a short time when it comes to these kinds of broad economic movements.

Because the hardest problems to solve, in realizing a multi-purpose robot that can do things in unstructured environments, are the really basic ones. Take for instance the peg and hole problem. We can readily program a robot to pick up a specific peg and place it in a specific hole, but to have a robot that can, like a 2 year old, pick up any peg and put it in any hole by feeling it's way through the situation is very difficult. But people are working on this, and progress is being made on solving this sort of heuristic perception/control problem. If you can do that one simple task the way a child would, then it's possible to build a library of simple behaviours that can be combined hierarchically to solve much more complex problems: but all that step 2 stuff much easier to do than figuring out how to put a peg in a hole the way a child would.

SelfDrivingCars,333kov,untaken-username,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:13:50 2015 UTC,"I thought we had finally wrapped our head around this concept.   The way you reduce the number of cars you need to manufacture is to either increase how many miles a vehicle will last for, or reduce the number of miles that people drive.   Self driving cars do little to increase the mileage lifetime of vehicles, and might actually encourage people to drive more. Yes, fleet service could significantly reduce the number of cars on the road at any given time, but you have to replace a car that travels 100,000 miles per year much more frequently than you do a vehicle that is driven 10,000 miles per year.   Now it may well have a huge impact on the auto industry, but self driving vehicles technology won't significantly reduce the number of vehicles that need to be manufactured."
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,TheAngryPlatypus,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:05:10 2015 UTC,Significantly reduced accident rates will greatly increase the average lifetime of cars.  I don't know any specific numbers... but I would think a common reason people buy new cars is because their current car gets totaled.  More self driving cars = less wrecks = less buying replacement vehicles.  So if nothing else that'd lower the overall purchase rate a bit.
SelfDrivingCars,333kov,Ritz87,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:57:51 2015 UTC,"Significantly reduced accident rates will greatly increase the average lifetime of cars.   Ah, I did forget about that, but it's not as big of a difference as you would think, as I've researched it before. Something like 1 in 4 vehicles is ultimately scrapped, but while that sounds substantial you have to remember that the vast majority of vehicles scrapped are near the end of their life anyway. It's hard to do enough damage to a $30,000 vehicle that it has to be scrapped. It's really easy to do enough damage to a $2,000 vehicle that it has to be scrapped.   Also a fairly high percentage of that figure is due to weather related issues (flood, hail, tornado, etc) or other damage which  likely to be prevented by self driving technology.   So will it be a factor? Yes. But I don't think it's fair to say it will greatly increase the average lifetime of all vehicles though. Let's say 15% of all vehicles are ultimately in an accident that causes the vehicle to be scrapped, and those vehicles have an average of 50,000 miles left in them, and self driving vehicles reduce that number by 90%. That's a 3% increase in overall vehicle mileage lifetime.   I'm somewhat pulling numbers out of my ass, but no matter what it's still going to be a relatively small (but significant) number.   Although the loss of profit from repair parts will definitely be a blow to manufacturers in its own right."

Another reason is that I want a car that fits me and that is always here when I need it. I don't want to wait 15 minutes for a taxi (even if it's without a human driver) just to go to the store that is 10 minutes away.   Third reason: car sharing already exists here. You just grab a car from one of many dedicated parking lots, drive it as much as you want, drop it off in any other dedicated parking spot (there are many around the city) and your credit card is charged automatically, for the distance and time that you used. It's not very popular because using your own car (especially if you drive a lot) is cheaper.  Why is it cheaper?

Autonomous cars changes that scenario because they will be strategically situated so they are less than 1-5 minutes away. Look at all the cars parked in your neighborhood. Imagine they are all able to drive themselves (without a passenger) Everyone of these cars would be able to take you where you want to go.   A taxi or lyft driver gambles by situating himself in a fare rich environment. Robocars do not need to.   This changes everything. No one will own their car, they will subscribe to one of several car sharing services.  Need to go somewhere, pick up your phone and hit the pick me up button and    a car will meet you where your at and take you where you want to go."

SelfDrivingCars,32twbr,MuffHuffer,10,Thu Apr 16 17:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just be aware that laws will likely require the self-driving car (SDC) to have a 30 second record from its sensors in case of any crash.  As an extension of this I consider it quite possible that where dangerous driving is recorded that could easily result in loss of life or limb that the SDC owner/operator may choose to inform enforcement officers - possibly close to real time of any such incidences.  Once word gets out that SDCs can report deliberately dangerous driving then that may, or may not, help to calm things. A bit like how dash-cams are becoming much more common place now."

SelfDrivingCars,32twbr,arewar,2,Thu Apr 16 18:52:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of humans would get road rage when this happens, and start being aggressive in return - a SDC would not. The fear of retaliation is a real damper on overly aggressive driving habits."
SelfDrivingCars,32twbr,StarManta,6,Fri Apr 17 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Given that we see plenty of that behavior already, there is no reason to think it won't get much worse.  SDCs are already being tweaked to drive a little more assertively as they've already had problems where other drivers (without knowing they are SD) perceive them as being driven 'timidly' and cut them off at 4-ways and merges.  I think once there's a critical mass, that problem will get worse for the reasons you indicate.  Dedicated, separated express lanes will help somewhat.  I could envision HOV lanes being barriered off and turned into SD-only.  That helps with a whole bunch of commuting and handoff problems and obviously prevents the scenarios you describe.  The main mitigation will come from the SD systems and services themselves.  The cars will be heavily instrumented and it is likely that one organization will provide the vehicles, insurance and support services.  If an SDC is in an accident, they will almost certainly be able to provide reams of evidence that the other driver was at fault.  This is a game changer in the sense that many aggressive drivers today get away with the accidents they cause by lying.  That gets a lot more difficult in the face of multiple high quality videos and extensive telemetry.  In problem areas they may coordinate with local law enforcement (not saying this is all good but...) to proactively request and support moving violations that don't result in an accident.  For example suppose the provider observes that one intersection is responsible for a high number of accidents.  They may share telemetry and video of local speeders and red light runners with the police and request that tickets be issued.  Or if the provider notices that a single driver is responsible for multiple claims, they may start to follow him selectively.  This will result in rapid behavior modification or (more likely) so many tickets so fast that his license will be suspended.  Additional to that, the provider may keep tabs on vehicles he might be driving to ensure that he doesn't just keep driving without a license (which happens more often than you might think) and to pursue charges if he does.  Finally, SDCs probably won't ""do everything possible to avoid an accident.""   They will do everything possible to avoid injuring or inconveniencing their riders and to avoid being liable for an accident but low speed accidents and sideswipes might not fall in either of those categories.  In that case, the SDC may just let it happen and automatically file a claim while finishing the trip.  tl;dr  I think people will learn pretty quickly not to poke the bear."
SelfDrivingCars,32twbr,bob4apples,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of very good points.  Thanks for the thoughtful answer.  Do you think the ACLU and similar organizations concerned with privacy will put up a fight around how the telemetry and video data can be used?  In the future, if this sort of data is detailed enough, it could be combined with biometric data to give law enforcement information on pedestrian whereabouts just because an SDC drove by."
SelfDrivingCars,32twbr,bob4apples,2,Thu Apr 16 21:04:01 2015 UTC,"Do you think the ACLU and similar organizations concerned with privacy will put up a fight around how the telemetry and video data can be used?   Of course.  All the uses I mentioned above are for the benefit the company that collects it.  Using it for an unrelated purpose (whether law enforcement, marketing or something else) will definitely be of concern.   In the future, if this sort of data is detailed enough, it could be combined with biometric data to give law enforcement information on pedestrian whereabouts just because an SDC drove by.   In theory yes but for a very long time it will be much easier to use fixed cameras optimized for facial recognition.  A biometric camera needs to have excellent resolution but can have a very low frame rate compared to a navcam or dashcam. They also work better if they aren't moving.  Finally, this avoids some of the arguments above since the cameras can be installed and maintained by law enforcement so there's no need to engage the third party."

For those who still want to live in the suburbs, I imagine long term those suburbs will also increase in density and become more walkable, and they'll be connected to cities via mass transit, which will become a more viable transportation option as robotaxis solve the last mile problem on both sides of the trip."

Don't see how you can come to that conclusion. With SDCs and automated taxis, transportation will become less painful and cheaper. Also with the increase inefficiencies due to automated driving traffic will become less of an issue. All of that means that people will be more inclined to spread out.   With cheap transportation available at the touch of a button, people will be able to easily go downtown from anywhere.

But furthermore, they base this on strictly a small segment of cities in the south (specifically Florida).     These southern Cities they list, are notoriously NON urban (meaning, downtown areas aren't as densely built out with residential areas as say, Boston, Portland, Minneapolis, Denver etc).     All the information I've found, says that overall, people are still moving toward cities       Now, obviously, I would agree that self driving cars would probably mitigate this trend. But at the same time one could argue that self driving cars would also increase the likely hood of people living in urban areas also! (As fewer people would need to OWN cars, they can just order one up a la Uber style SDC services).    So, I'm not saying it won't happen. But this article does not do a very good job of proving that (overall) people are moving out of cities. All data I can find says otherwise."
SelfDrivingCars,32ou06,RecordHigh,2,Wed Apr 15 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"One thing to keep in mind is that just because most inner cities have stopped or reversed their declining population tends of the last 75 years, it doesn't mean that their nearby suburbs are now in decline. Most cities in the US are predominantly suburban, by a fairly wide margin, actually, and a few thousand new people per year moving into the inner city doesn't change the overall trend towards the suburbs that much.   Beyond that, I think the reason for the conflicting arguments that you are seeing is that the city vs suburb dichotomy is become more and more irrelevant, at least in the US. This is because areas that were considered suburban 20 or more years ago are looking more and more urban as time goes by, even if they aren't quite considered urban today.   Ultimately,  I don't see self-driving cars changing population densities much. Being able to reclaim driving time for more productive pursuits should result in  some people being willing to accept longer commutes and longer trips to stores and entertainment, but how much time are people really willing to sit in the car, driverless or not, and at what cost? Ultimately most people will still want to live in relatively close proximity to places they go regularly--think today's suburbs. On the other end of the spectrum, better car services should make living in built up cities more convenient,  so that should presumably make urban areas more attractive than they are now. So I think SDCs are a wash in that sense."

The thing is though, just like you said, the distinction between downtown and suburb is changing. So, I think I agree that ultimately SDC won't affect the already changing landscape.

A millennial doesn't want to spend 45 minutes travelling to work, 45 minutes traveling back from work and again another 45 minutes to the city for leisure and 45 minutes back a day.   Larger denser international cities are 24 hour cities. Full automation will enable all cities to become 24 hour places and the others to be even more so. Habits will change.

SelfDrivingCars,32p33w,PaulGodsmark,7,Wed Apr 15 15:55:08 2015 UTC,"""And what about robo-cars? The dream of personal, on-demand service is that it will be there just for you whenever you want it and take you directly to your destination. These kinds of services will certainly be useful in lower-density areas and during off-peak times when demand is low. However, during rush hours in dense urban areas where road space is already a scarce commodity, this dream just doesn’t pencil out. Adding substantially more cars to our congested roads — whether automated or shared or otherwise — just isn’t possible.""   Interesting conclusion that flies in the face of a growing body of research that shows that with automated taxi ride-sharing that increasing average vehicle occupancy can fundamentally change the transit/congestion balance."
SelfDrivingCars,32p33w,SilverShrimp0,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:02:44 2015 UTC,"Also, during peak demand there is what... 30% of vehicles in use. If 10 personally owned vehicles are replaced by 1 shared fleet vehicle, then during these peak times there would be only 1 shared fleet vehicle in operation for every 3 personally owned vehicles. It remains to be seen what ratio replacement providers will deploy. If they can encourage ride sharing during peak demand then it is reasonable to expect the figure that zipcar have talked of, after all they are the business interest that would seek to operate such fleets. A replacement rate of 1 shared fleet vehicle for 15 personally owned vehicles."
SelfDrivingCars,32p33w,Diplomjodler,3,Wed Apr 15 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"In peak morning periods typically 17% to 20% of vehicles are on the roads. If we can use shared automated taxis that raise the average vehicle occupancy from the current 1.2, to about 1.8 then we can either carry 50% more people with the same number of vehicles, or we can have 33% fewer vehicles on the road.  In reality there could be induced demand of about 30% max. of the population wanting to use this improved service - but that still means fewer vehicles and a substantial reduction in congestion. Which means that we could see a considerable modal shift from transit to shared automated taxis.  Not forgetting that on-demand point-to-point services are much more convenient for many commuters than fixed-route, fixed schedule transit. Even with a small price premium people will put convenience ahead of cost - especially when the weather is miserable and they don't want to wait in the cold for their bus/train.  If shared automated taxis end up being lower cost than transit, then I suggest that the impacts on existing transit could be disruptive - even in some congested/high density corridors."

There are a considerable number of journeys that are sub 1 km even 1/2 km. It's anyone's best guess how much business deploying purpose built vehicles will eliminate journeys too. Study's need to be conducted sooner rather than later in relation to people's behavioral patterns in relation to current journeys that could be undertaken by a purpose built fully autonomous delivery vehicle and whether or not people when questioned would adopt this approach."

There is no way the vast majority of the population is going to have fully autonomous, self-driving cars within the next, say, 50 years. It is going to be a slow transition, with the wealthy and middle class benefiting significantly more and significantly earlier than those with lower incomes. There is a significant population boom occuring in Metro Vancouver, and as such ridership numbers for transit are going to continue to climb for quite some time. Significant ongoing investment in ""fixed-route transit"" is going to be required until well after this guy's career is over. I don't think he should have used the word never, but from his perspective it is too far into the future to begin affecting funding decisions for transit infrastructure projects."

If he had used phrases that were less emphatic then I wouldn't have an issue, as there is almost always room for doubt when we talk about the future in this way.  I can provide ample research evidence to suggest that that are numerous scenarios where it is clear that fully autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce the number of vehicles on the roads whilst conveying even more people that currently travel by road. This would lead to a reduction in congestion and a probably significant modal shift from transit to road travel.

On top of that, disruptive technologies almost always have a steeper adoption rate than other technologies of the same time period.

SelfDrivingCars,32pe96,lankg9fkh,7,Wed Apr 15 17:18:48 2015 UTC,"I would see more people owning their SDCs in rural environments (at least as a primary vehicle). The shared fleet will work best in high density environments where one wouldn't need to worry about finding parking for their vehicle or wouldn't have to wait long for a SDC fleet vehicle to show up at their location. Parking is not a problem in rural environments, and a shared vehicle would take longer to show up at a location due to the number of vehicles deployed. If I had to wait 30 minutes every time I wanted a shared vehicle, I would probably purchase my own.    I still think an SDC would be useful in rural environments, but some of the rural work (e.g. hauling things from/to a field location that has no road) may require manual input. I could still see a vehicle being self driving, but for these odd cases where you need to place the vehicle in a particular location, one might have a remote control/video game controller type device that would allow you to position the vehicle exactly where you need it (although it might still override you if it determines it would get damaged in a particular location)"
SelfDrivingCars,32pe96,monkey_fish,2,Wed Apr 15 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"Where I live - the more rural areas of South Lanarkshire, well, you absolutely need to drive, where am is sparsely populated at best, no streetlights, and weather is particularly bad at times, in winter.   This is an acknowledged challenge that companies like Google (etc) have been discussing and working on.    I can't quite see SDC's totally replacing manually-driven cars though, what about people who live out in the sticks, like myself?   When people discuss SDC takeover, they are talking quite long-term. In the short term, people will drive too. I'm sure plenty of people stayed with horses when cars came onto the market too for various reasons - expense, fear, experience, maintenance, etc.   it's just impractical and unenforcable to get every car to be an SDC in the future, things like public opinion, political pressures etc. may slow things down somewhat.   Again, quite long-term. It is absolutely possible to force every car on the road, but we're talking 50+ years (imo). It's a cultural shift just as much as an economic shift. These take time.   Also, car ownership makes loads of £££'s for the Government, whether it be personalizing cars, as many neds up here tend to do, revving them loudly, racing on the streets, or taxing us to the hilt. I can't see local governments embracing it that well    Again, short term vs long term and cultural shifts. Gov't will still make money off cars - insurance, taxes from SDC-providing companies, taxes off selling and production and maintenance of SDC. The revenue sources will change, not evaporate.    especially North Lanarkshire, AFAIK they're not really interested in trialling SDC's let alone supporting them in the area, if social media is anything to go by, same for South Lanarkshire. I can't see many neds wanting an SDC, though, TBH.   Cultural shift. My grandmother didn't get a computer until like 5 years ago.   Aren't a lot of posts online very pie-in-the-sky thinking, I mean the year 2000 came and went, and it was hardly The Jetsons as people thought it would be in the 60s and 70s! (well, I was born in 1978, you can probably work out how old I am!)   I do agree that the dates a lot of people discuss here are a little too optimistic. Between the politics and the technology, my own personal thinking is 50 years at minimum for full automation. (I hope and want it sooner, but even 50 seems optimistic to me.) I think we'll see partial automation sooner, such as cars driving themselves on the highway, because that's very predictable.    Sure, there's no denying SDCs are useful, but it probably won't be every situation.   If the technology advances to the desired point, they will be useful in all situations.   I can't see the average Joe living in the rural areas of the Scottish Borders needing an SDC   Scotland has great public transit to my knowledge. They don't need cars, much less SDC. You can't replace demand that doesn't exist. That aside, SDC doesn't replace just cars. It can replace buses and delivery services too, which will be useful for Joe.   Equally, SDCs set a bit of an odd precedent, what next for automation - footballers out of a job due to robots playing matches, an entire autonomous football team?   Sports are last on the list because if there was robotic perfection, the games wouldn't be interesting.  Next - cashiers and waiters at restaurants. But again that's a cultural shift. We already see order touch screens at a lot of restaurants - Sheets, Chili's, McDonalds just recently started a trial of them."

That's true, but if you're buying a new car and an SDC is like $1000 more, you'd probably get one. All cars didn't have seat belts before, all cars didn't have third brake lights before, all cars didn't have airbags before. But now they're all pretty ubiquitous safety features of cars. SDC technology will be similar.   If your smart phone breaks, well crap. If your car breaks, your life is potentially in danger.   SDCs can fail safe, meaning if they break they do the safest thing possible to ""limp"" to safety. Also, there are so many systems in automobiles that a part breaking won't necessarily disable the entire vehicle. For instance, my friend's Cadillac has a broken gas gauge, 4 worn out brakes, a tire with a slow leak, a minor oil leak, and a major transmission leak, and the car is still driveable and quite smooth.    Political resistance against smart phones was virtually nonexistent. Political resistance against SDC will be very high.   That's kind of true. Some places are more accepting of it than others. And I think it will take longer to adopt than cell phones, but I don't think it will take 50 years. Maybe 20 years at the most.    Cost alone is a serious barrier for the quick spread of cars.   How? People buy cars pretty frequently, about every 5-10 years max. Sure it's a major purchase, but it's also something that's not as disposable as a smart phone so people take the decision more seriously.    If the government provided significant assistance, then I would absolutely agree it would spread rapidly, but given the likelihood of political hurdles I find that unlikely.

I was using ""break"" very loosely. What I was more leaning towards was the average person's perception of these items. For example, if the battery on your phone overheats and kills your phone (ie. the technology fails), it sucks but it's probably not life threatening. In an SDC, your life is reliant on that technology and that by nature makes the average joe more wary of adopting the technology.  You could also probably compare it to vaccines. It took quite awhile for people to adopt them and take them regularly, but now they are pretty wide spread and the safety is proven. Yet there's still some idiots out there shouting death and destruction and government nanobots in your blood stream.   People buy cars pretty frequently, about every 5-10 years max.

It will take a good span of time for SDC to enter the used car market widely.   It will, but only about 10 years. I rarely see people driving 20 year old cars, and I don't personally know anyone with a car made in the 1990s or before. I have a 1988 Monte Carlo SS, but it's a collector car and I don't really drive it.   I agree... but at the same time, all those items are ubiquitous because they are legally required now.

In an SDC, your life is reliant on that technology and that by nature makes the average joe more wary of adopting the technology.   But again, there's not one technology you're relying on. If the LIDAR fails, there are still local cameras and GPS systems that wouldn't be affected. I don't see how your life is reliant on ""the technology"" as you call it, or what specific technology you're concerned about failing. And again, even if it does fail you haven't explained how that will endanger a person's life. A tire could blow, but that could happen now. It's more likely that a SDC will know that a tire is about to blow and disable itself before there's an accident.    Yet there's still some idiots out there shouting death and destruction and government nanobots in your blood stream.   That's true, and there are always technology detractors. But they are always in the minority. I think when they see people asleep in their cars during their commute it won't matter as much how that's possible, only that it's possible and available. And there's absolutely no way that SDCs will kill 40k plus people per year like humans do. That simple fact will overwhelm detractors.   Vaccine deniers have the benefit of living in a society that's largely vaccinated so they may not understand the benefits as much because they're spoiled by the effectiveness of vaccination. But SDCs are more tangible everyday items that you can see a direct impact immediately. Vaccines are invisible so people can see causation where there really is none.   10 years is about the minimum people keep their cars now. Source. And in my opinion that number will keep falling.   Ok, so if that number is falling then adoption will happen faster as time progresses.    But that aside, in the beginning we're discussing new cars, not just cars in general. Many, many people only buy or can only afford used cars.   That's true, and they'll have to wait. I still don't see a problem with mass adoption within 10 years. People keep cars for a long time because new cars don't offer much else besides maybe GPS (which is on everybody's phone now) and new styling (which a lot of people don't care about). But I think a car that drives itself is an upgrade worth paying for and trading in a car faster than normal for.    Source See the ""policy problems"" section.   First, this is a really old article and several other states have allowed SDC licensing since 2013. And most of the legal/liability questions in the article have been answered. I don't really see any of them as huge obstacles to the technology as car manufacturers have been thinking about this for over a decade already.    But on top of the potential problems with laws, some of it is a lack of faith/respect in the political system too.   Tech companies are pretty good at making their tech work within legal constraints. The political system is waiting on the tech companies to finalize the product so they can know what to regulate. And just like in other industries, the tech companies will end up writing the laws for themselves and paying the politicians to pass them.   But we'll see soon. Tesla is going to send a software to their Model S cars this year to allow it to drive itself on highways. We'll see how many malfunction and how many people die. My guess is the Model S will soon be known as the safest car on the planet because a computer can see more than a human (no blind spots) and react much faster and in a more standardized manner than a human."

You could be correct, and you're right I'm pretty optimistic about it. My main point is that I see very few 1990s cars driving around, so I expect very few 2000s cars driving around in the 2020s. I think there's no real motivation for people to buy a 2010s car as opposed to a 1990s one except for things like styling and reliability and ""newness"" for lack of a better term. If you compare a 1995 BMW 7-Series to a 2015 BMW 7-Series, they're both smooth luxury cars with leather seats and Bose audio. Besides the GPS and the newer body I can't think of much reason to buy the new one. I think SDC technology will be seen as a greater feature than all of the above, which will compel consumers to adopt it faster.   And I think the other major issue is safety. Once there's a critical mass of SDCs on the road, it will become absolutely clear how much safer they are than human driven vehicles. Lower insurance rates and fuel costs will also drive fast adoption for lower income individuals.   But we'll see. I think we both hope I'm right.

SelfDrivingCars,32pe96,sweetmoses,2,Fri Apr 17 04:42:21 2015 UTC,"Eventually AI will be better than humans driving on-road or off-road. I don't see any issue with having self-driving cars anywhere.   Rural areas would probably be the last place to have human drivers, but ultimately they could eventually be banned there on most roads as well. In the age of self-driving cars, every time a human causes an injury or death there could be intense pressure from the media and society to remove that risk from our lives.   Perhaps the transition to allowing only computer driven cars will go in stages. First some designated lanes on major arteries could be made computer only. Then, whole city centers might follow and then entire cities. During those periods, people who live in rural areas and still drive their own car might only be able to permitted to drive to the edge of the city. Temporary parking areas may be established to allow people to transfer to a robo-taxi to safely access the core of the city."
SelfDrivingCars,32pe96,Sidewinder77,2,Wed Apr 15 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"I think that individual ownership of cars will continue.  I know when I have an SDC i will want to smoke, drink, and maybe even masturbate in what I will start considering my second bedroom.  I wouldn't want to share that.  Dense urban environments will have shared fleets, but I still expect many people, especially in rural areas, to own their own pimped out SDC."
SelfDrivingCars,32pe96,Staback,2,Wed Apr 15 20:34:14 2015 UTC,"People on here keep saying self-driving cars will be good, car ownership won't be necessary, but is that really true?   First I want to make sure you're not conjoining self driving cars with the death of car ownership. Obviously it makes self driving fleets possible, but there's no reason that should preclude personal ownership of a self driving car for those that so desire. Personal ownership will undoubtedly be more prevalent in rural areas.   well, you absolutely need to drive, where am is sparsely populated at best, no streetlights, and weather is particularly bad at times, in winter.   There's no reason to believe a viable, commercial self driving car won't be able to handle these situations at least as well if not better than a human driver. Yes, there are current challenges with weather, but there is a lot of advances left to make before products are released and they've just started addressing these problems.    it's just impractical and unenforcable to get every car to be an SDC in the future, things like public opinion, political pressures etc.    It's not going to happen overnight. Public opinion and political pressure changes. Get back to me after a generation or two has grown up largely not even bothering to get a driver's license and see what public opinion is.    Also, car ownership makes loads of £££'s for the Government...Would governments really want to stop one of their major revenue sources?   Self driving cars can also save government plenty on infrastructure. At any rate it's not like the government can't just raise other vehicle fees to offset any lost income. You seem to be really stuck on the notion that everything will stay the same.    What do you think? Would an SDC be useful in rural areas?   Possibly not as useful, so adoption may take longer. But I suspect that, as things are more spread out in rural areas there may be some unique advantages, especially for those incapable of driving. In the city if you have bad eyesight and can't drive you can probably walk to the market. In the suburbs your kids soccer practice is probably a couple of miles down the road. In rural areas you can use a self driving car for this. It may also make delivery services more viable, which is even more handy when things aren't convenient.   Also who wouldn't rather read a book, play PS4, or surf Reddit on the hour drive into civilization?"

I see the cars for farms and other remote areas having self driving capabilities but also having the standard controls for a 4 wheel drive so that long trips into town are easier and it is still useful on the farm.  It is likely that at least to begin with a group of farmers would buy one to use between them much the same as already happens with the more expensive farming equipment that is needed only once or twice a year, or only needed for part of the year."

But even if they're not, that's one vehicle that doesn't even exist on the road yet.   Especially for ""gen 1"" AMVs, there's no way you'd lose your windows, because manual driving will still be necessary and most likely legally required for at LEAST a few years after their inception.  Even after AMVs become mainstream, the whole point of them is so that we can enjoy our drive more and be safer - environmental awareness fits into both of those, so I can not only enjoy the mountain view on my way to work, but also reflexively hit the brake when some kid jumps in the street.

I've been lucky enough to speak to some of the engineers behind it, and it's a fascinating combination of technology and psychology. It will be interesting to see how self-driving cars interact with each other and the existing infrastructure."
SelfDrivingCars,32kiqx,CarBuyerUK,2,Tue Apr 14 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that the Smart Motorways are perhaps a bad investment and they should invest in connected vehicles instead. [I live in the UK and have seen them taking years to build them].   Key number one is that due to electronics, separations between vehicles can and will go down, both nose to tail and side to side.  When one vehicle puts on its brakes all the others know about it in a few milliseconds and slow accordingly.  If you didn't have the electronics then after deadline X you have to stick to A roads.  The electronics could be retrofitted.    The next step is handling intersections, say where a medium sized road (A Road) crosses a motorway (freeway or autobahn).  Here the first car to offer a congestion solution can contribute it to the others.  It would work like the CSMA/CD protocol in Ethernet (google it).  A new congestion solution could be proposed say every 100 milliseconds.  There would be no centralised control, but rather a distributed approach.   I acknowledge that the transition to autonomous requires some thought.  I think autonomous vehicles will almost all be electric."
SelfDrivingCars,32kiqx,robertbowerman,4,Tue Apr 14 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, you could. This paper appears close to what you're describing, except instead of centrally controlling automated vehicles, they gave simulated agents manipulated route information.    Regarding the abstract model, the simulations show that it is useful to manipulate the route information given to agents, which allows the control system to divert them to the more convenient alternative from the point of view of both the overall system and the individual agents.   To implement this practically, I'd think you'd want real-time variable pricing for different routes, which would encourage a portion of cars to take the perceived slower route. And I imagine variable road pricing will be used with self-driving cars, as it provides so many advantages."
SelfDrivingCars,32kiqx,jimcc333,5,Tue Apr 14 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"Somewhat related, but stoplights and intersections should flow faster if (self-driving) vehicles entering can communicate with each other and organize.

SelfDrivingCars,328nfc,greg_barton,2,Sat Apr 11 22:59:49 2015 UTC,"I certainly could be wrong, but I believe that the primary features that most consumers want in their transportation are as follows:   Cheap Reliable (This goes hand-in-hand with the next point) Available on demand / ready when you need to use it (Note: this is the key reason people buy cars today) Efficient / fast Safe Low maintenance   I believe that a large, well-optimized fleet of autonomous vehicles can achieve greater success in all of those criteria than car ownership can. An eventual (decades out) well set-up system will be:   Far, far cheaper   No down payment on a vehicle, no monthly payments, no vehicle leasing costs. You only pay for what you use No fossil fuel costs, as vehicles will be all electric No need to pay hundreds of $$ per month on auto insurance  Cleaner and better for the environment Available whenever you need a vehicle Saving drivers time, by having to worry about finding parking Faster on both surface streets and freeways than human drivers   Intelligent autonomous vehicles can route around traffic delays Autonomous vehicles can maintain smaller safe distances between vehicles, while traveling faster.  Orders of magnitude safer than human drivers 0 maintenance for the consumer - without owning a car, you'll never take your car to the shop again   There are certainly some people out there who would value personal ownership of an expensive object that sits unused the vast majority of the time over the features I described above (mainly for luxury vehicle owners, or to show off their wealth), but I think that's really the minority of the population.  In my opinion, if as a society we can actually reliably achieve everything I listed above (which I think autonomous fleets of vehicles could do given enough time), then I think most consumers will be willing to give up the idea of owning an expensive vehicle, because they'd be getting everything they wanted out of their transportation system. I know I certainly would. I'm not saying that we're close to that point today - I think it's easily decades away, but I think that's the direction we're heading in.

SelfDrivingCars,328nfc,MutantFrk,8,Sat Apr 11 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"You are making a mistake that I see made here all the time: comparing car ownership today with the idealized version of a self-driving car (SDC) service of the future and assuming that car ownership won't benefit from some of the same efficiencies and technological advances. Also, that a new SDC service will be run by some benevolent non-profit organization with unlimited resources, immune from market forces and other business expenses.   In terms of car services being cheaper because there are no ownership costs (e.g., lease payments,  insurance,  maintenance, etc.), you will still have to pay for those things,  they will just be hidden in the fee you pay for a ride. I also don't know of any companies that employee no people, so you will also be paying for their benefits and salaries as well as overhead and profit for the company.  Sure, there may be some efficiencies of scale,  but the company that owns the cars will pass those costs on to the consumer. And you can already buy a car with no fossil fuel costs,  so I don't see what that has to do with SDC services (I've had an electric car and solar panels to charge it for the last 2 years).  Your other points about availability,  saving time, and safety would all be true or even better for an SDC that a person owns as opposed to one that they call from an SDC service. For example,  no matter how good a car service is, a car that a person owns will be more available.  And you could always tell it to go park itself or have it keep circling the block until you're ready to be picked up.

Sure, there may be some efficiencies of scale, but the company that owns the cars will pass the cost on to the consumer.   I think you're 100% correct - car ownership in the next few decades will definitely benefit from some of the same efficiencies. And the fleet companies will absolutely pass the cost onto the consumer, because that's the only sensical thing to do. But many of these base costs will go down over time with electric autonomous vehicles as well, and efficiencies of scale shouldn't be underestimated. E.g.   Insurance costs will drop with far fewer accidents. Insurance costs for human drivers will likely stay the same. Well designed electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts (see: Model S), and are easier to maintain, leading to fewer failures, and easier maintenance    you can already buy a car with no fossil fuel costs, so I don't see what that has to do with SDC services   True that they're available today! But again, as we see battery technology improve over the next few decades, I believe that hybrid, and eventually all electric vehicles will become more commonplace. What we really need is one good leap in battery technology to carry us forward.  Also, as autonomous technology becomes more commonplace over the next few decades, competition will drive ever-decreasing profit margins, leading to cheaper prices for the consumer.   I've had an electric car and solar panels to charge it for the last 2 years   Awesome! Do you have pictures of that setup anywhere / any photo story of getting it up and running? How much does your solar setup offset your charging cost?   Your other points about availability, saving time, safety would all be true or even better for an self driving car that a person owns as opposed to calling on a fleet vehicle for a ride for example, no matter how good a car service is, my own personal car will be more available.   I think this is potentially true, but then we're right back to one of the first ideas: If most other things were equal (except for probably maintenance / reliability), what's the appeal in paying a large up-front cost for something that you won't use the vast majority of the time, when you could just be paying for it during the time that you use it?  Edit: Errgh formatting."
SelfDrivingCars,328nfc,MutantFrk,4,Sun Apr 12 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"I don't have any pictures of my solar panels or car handy, but I have a 2012 Chevy Volt and 11 Kw of solar panels on my roof. The Volt can run on gas, but my daily round trip commute is within the electric range of the car, so I rarely use any gas. Also, I can charge at work, but I don't consistently do that (too much competition for the charging stations, and it isn't usually necessary to go round trip on electricity as I mentioned). At home, I have the car set to charge primarily during daylight hours, and then in the middle of the night if necessary to get a full charge by the morning.  During the day I sell my excess solar electricity to the power company and then buy it back at night, so to say that I charge the car directly from the solar panels 100% of the time is perhaps a stretch,  but I do generate more solar electricity than I use in a year for my car and home. The ROI on the car and solar panels together is complicated, but the solar panels should pay for themselves in about 8 years with all the tax incentives and the power saving.  With regards to the question of why pay the upfront costs for a car that you aren't using most of the time, I think this question involves a lot of variables that we don't have answers for. I actually did a very detailed calculation of what it cost me to drive to work and back with my current situation and some basic assumptions about how long I would own the car and what the lifetime costs would be, and while it came out to be more than I expected,  it was hard to imagine an SDC service beating that cost by very much if at all. And it doesn't just come down to cost.  Even if an SDC service could shave $100 off my monthly costs (and that's questionable),  would that really be worth it? The convenience of having my own car, clean and customized for my comfort,  and not having to worry about issues of supply and demand when I need a ride would easily be worth it.  I think it's important to note that I live in a fairly car-oriented area in that everyone I know has a car, most have their own garage, and they almost all drive themselves to work. So we have all baked the cost of car ownership into our lives already."
SelfDrivingCars,328nfc,RecordHigh,-1,Sun Apr 12 00:59:19 2015 UTC,"You have not looked into this in enough detail. Shared fleet prediction models have shown that this model can be more convenient than car ownership. While local government will make it less convenient to own a car. They highlighted very valid points. It is as much about the ability to pay per trip and based on a monthly subscription as it is total cost. Cash flow is a major issue for many car owners. We are talking tens of millions in the US.   Shared fleets are about efficiency. The most common shared fleet vehicle will be a 2 seat electric one. These vehicles based on current lifetime miles and deployment models will last only 2 years. So the person using a vehicle will be using a vehicle that is considerably newer than the one being used by private owners. If you are a private owner, you are more likely to stick with the current model of driving around in a contingency plan. Vehicles that use gas, so have longer range. Vehicles that have 5 seats. You will also be purchasing the vehicle at current costs. Where as a like for like the  same vehicle will cost a company buying 1000 at once considerably less. With vehicle ownership, the more miles you do the cheaper the per mile cost becomes. The impact of fixed costs.   Your average person does not want to have to deal with the issues that car ownership presents. If they don't have to, they will choose not to."
SelfDrivingCars,328nfc,RecordHigh,0,Mon Apr 13 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"I have actually looked into it quite a bit, and I've thought about it even more. Most of the studies I have seen postulate an ideal technological future, and tend to ignore the real world motivations of people.   I'm not sure how you define ""convenient"" but I can not imagine a scenario in the foreseeable future in which a car that someone else owns will be more convenient to you than one that you own. First,  the companies that will own these fleet cars will still be for profit and subject to the principles of supply and demand, and they will not have a car for you instantly every time you need one, either due to excessive demand, a lack of supply in sparsely populated areas, or a financial disincentive.  Also, to call a fleet car will require a fairly elaborate series of communication and dispatching systems to work perfectly, and those systems will certainly fail from time to time. And even when they are working perfectly, maybe your phone will be dead or without a signal. Good luck calling a car in that case.   And I don't understand your point about the age of the car. That fact won't mean much to the passengers of these services, particularly if the car is owned by someone else and outfitted with the sort of institutional, high durability, low comfort interior that is likely to be installed by a company that is trying to maximize profits. And don't even get me started on the inevitable nonsense that a company will subject its patrons to in order to make an extra buck off of their captive audience--data mining, services designed to nickel and dime customers to death, ads running on a video screen that you can not turn off, etc... A car that you own that is customized to your tastes in terms of quality, comfort, aesthetics, and entertainment options--not to mention one that is always available when you need it--will always be more convenient.  In terms of the economies of scale that you mention, there will certainly be some to be had, but owning a cheap car is not a terribly expensive proposition today, so those fleet rides will literally have to be pennies per mile to kill car ownership in 95% of the US. Also, don't forget that there are already car services and public transportation options available to most of the US population and I can tell you that taking a cab everywhere is literally an order of magnitude more expensive than driving your own car in most places. Will the car service of the future drive the costs down below that of car ownership? Maybe, but even if they do, many people will be willing to pay a premium for the convenience and social standing of owning their own car, just like some people today are willing to buy a Mercedes, while others are content with a Toyota Tercel.  And to that previous point, who says the average person does not want to deal with the issues of car ownership? The majority of adults in the US already own cars and a fair number of the ones that don't would own one if they could afford one. So, I don't think your assumption holds up."

Also fleet service will almost certainly exist most places as an option, so if your car is in the shop for a couple of days no big deal.

The trend of people moving to more densely populated areas will continue. In these areas shared fleets will be more optimum than anywhere else. The millennial's are already shunning learning to drive and car ownership. That is a trend that will continue. As a result in these densely populated areas, personal ownership will begin to be punished. In several forms. Banning personal ownership, congestion charges, increased parking charges and removal of and re-purposing of parking spaces.   The one thing very rarely discussed is how business will use autonomous vehicles. They too will exploit this great opportunity.

With the shared fleet model, we can easily transform our roads. Many through roads and side streets can simply by re-purposed. Cars can be programmed to stay on the high capacity corridors.   When it comes to projects like this they should be left alone completely. We should sit back and embrace vehicle automation. Watch as it transforms our way of life and then make informed decisions of plugging the wholes. Such large projects always come funded by government. Let's stop wasting people's money. Take less tax off them and stop shooting for ridiculous transportation infrastructure projects.   Is there a congestion problem? We know there isn't. The problem is what exists in this paradigm. Networks are like a boat with a few holes in. But instead of plugging the holes, the people on board are busy expanding the boat. So it sinks at a slower rate. But they are not addressing the holes. You go to any major city and there are literally just a few bottlenecks exaggerating the problems.    I say let's rid ourselves of the problem here too. Humans. Organisations like Google are creating highly detailed maps. They can run simulations on these maps. Millions of them everyday. As they actually are. Thus highlighting the optimum solution to infrastructure upgrades for our road networks. They have the means to simulate every little tweak. The impact of closing just one road."
SelfDrivingCars,325fv1,strike2867,2,Fri Apr 10 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"No large vehicle needs to be in operation during peak hours.    Businesses operate during the day, they do shipping and receiving during the day. Trucks with multiple deliveries on board (UPS/FedEx) as well as business to business transfers of raw and finished goods need to drop off when there is someone there to receive them so that the building/garage door/etc is unlocked and open and there is a place to put the goods.  To do otherwise would require automated keyfobs (and access) given to each delivery service, a mini receiving warehouse outside of every actual warehouse, or a dedicated delivery vehicle for each individual shipment sitting in a parking lot waiting for the business to open, then sitting there all day so they can drive back during the off peak night time hours again.  Not particularly likely that occurs anytime soon.  Unless by peak hours you simply mean during rush hour traffic, in which case that already occurs to a great extent that anyone who can avoids the peak times."

They will be very quiet, so basically hardly any noise pollution.    The average age of a car in U.S. is 11.4 years. In the next 4 years, outside of Tesla, not a single major car manufacturer is expecting the number or electric cars to make up more than a few percent of their sales. The other question is whether we could even build enough batteries to replace all the cars on the road today. Tesla's gigafactory could supply batteries for 500k cars per year, and won't even be ready for another 5 years. There are 253 million cars on U.S. roads alone. You also don't understand that not everybody wants to share cars. I'd say the majority don't, otherwise car sharing services would be a lot more popular."
SelfDrivingCars,325fv1,anothergaijin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:05:02 2015 UTC,"Major cities will become more aggressive. They will act like they already have done. Congestion charges already exist. Banning cars on certain days already exists. Soon a ban on anything other than electric will exist too. Along with personal ownership.   That is the average age. But for anyone who understands, the average age of cars will drop considerably. A shared fleet vehicle will last around 2 years and replace between 10 and 15 personally owned vehicles in major cities. So sticking with just Tesla they state that their new factory will produce 500,000 vehicles annually. With shared fleets that would serve 10 - 15 million people. That is the capability of just one factory by one supplier in North America by 2020. Without even mentioning all the battery packs they will supply to the market. They alone will expand beyond that level of production in 15 years time. At double, that is 20 - 30 million people. Just from one organisation. Don't be unwise. Don't think other major car manufacturers will shun electric. Many already have plans to compete with the next Tesla car like for like."
SelfDrivingCars,325fv1,bob4apples,2,Mon Apr 13 09:34:04 2015 UTC,"That is the capability of just one factory by one supplier in North America by 2020.   Okay so it's going to take over 7 years to build one factory to supply 10-15 million people for 2 years (I think that's a wild overestimate of how many it would actually be, maybe 2 million is what I'd go with, but I'll show you that your math is still wrong). There isn't anybody that I'm aware of that's building or planning another gigafactory today. But by your math, it would take 8-13 gigafactories to be producing enough battery packs if they're only lasting 2 years. That means in the next 6 years or so, probably less, they'd need to start construction on around 10.5 gigafactories. A highly unrealistic goal.   Banning cars on certain days already exists.   In Paris. Out of the major cities, how many have done it, and how many are planning to do it?   Congestion charges already exist   That's only in London, not a very common thing whatsoever.

SelfDrivingCars,325fv1,anothergaijin,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:31:26 2015 UTC,"500,000 by 2020 from this one factory is enough for between 10-15 million people. They will also be manufacturing battery packs for the market too. While they will increase the supply if the demand is there, which it will be. So this one location can easily be expected to be pumping out in excess of 1 million vehicles a year by 2030. At 1 million that is between 20-30 million people served. The 500,000 is supply not capacity. If they think they can sell 500,000 units a year by 2020 then expect supply to continue to increase. My comment was about major cities. The demand for major cities isn't 250 million cars. If it was, with the shared fleet model, the annual demand would be around 12.5m cars manufactured.   Just one company by 2020 will be manufacturing 4% of that level of demand.  By 2030 that could easily be in excess of 10%. The other manufacturers are already looking to compete. Especially considering how manufacturing costs of electric vehicles will reach parity with their internal combustion engine counterparts by around 2022.   If people have a viable alternative to 'gas' cars and personal ownership, cities will seek to effectively punish people for both owning a car and for it being 'gas'. It is inevitable."

On the other hand, Uber's current business model is private owners renting out their privately-owned vehicles along with a driving service.   It would be just as easy for Uber to have a Getaround style car-sharing model: instead of me driving the car, I just go into my office, tell the car to take jobs from Uber from 8:30am to 6pm, and then from 7pm until 7:30am. The vehicle is still mine, Uber still makes money, I still make money.   I think this is a much more realistic model of Uber's future. However, Uber will also own a fleet of cars to fill the gaps in service (for example, rush hour). Uber doesn't need to own and operate a fleet of vehicles in the self-driving world for their business model to work perfectly fine and remain profitable, owning a fleet just gives them more marketplace dominance."

Generally though, the cost I would pay per month is cheaper than I pay for auto insurance, and the total amount I drive is just a few times per week, maybe a total of 2 hours per week (I take public transit to work). As it is right now, my girlfriend predominately bikes, but also uses car2go 3x to 5x times a week depending upon the weather, her bill is usually less than $70 a month, because she drives for 10-15 minutes at a time.   Compared to my truck: $300 monthly payments, $70 insurance, $80 in fuel, $20 in oil, plus additional other maintenance (right now, my starter is shot, that's going to cost me $100-$300 fix). Even after I've paid off my truck, I'm still going to be paying more in fuel, maintenance, and insurance that I would be for Car2Go.

For the average person though it's nowhere close. 12,000 miles/yr is typical. Let's guess that's at 45mph average. That's about $7K/yr in car2go expenses and you have a big pile of inconveniences that car ownership doesn't have.  For anyone using it infrequently and in an area with lots of cars, I could see it making a ton of sense, but it's not fair to call it cheaper than car ownership.

SelfDrivingCars,31s0q5,fidelitypdx,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"The service is a godsend. Now they've got ones with bike racks too, so you can bike when the weather nice (or just bike downhill), then commute home for a just a few dollars more than a bus ticket.   They're another company, just like Uber, who will transition over to driverless cars in the near future. Except, if Car2Go's model is all about staying the owners of the fleet, so in this case Uber will probably crush them during this next 5-10 years as SDC Level 4 become taxis."
SelfDrivingCars,31p7iz,walky22talky,0,Tue Apr 7 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"It's my favorite thing to speculate about. Can Uber do it? They might be toast when sdcs come. Do you think Google will play ball with them? Relationships are strained. Apple certainly won't. Is it possible for a company like Uber to start up their own autonomous OS division and do it themselves? Possibly. But they still need cars. I think Uber gets exponential trends. They certaintly don't get manufacturing. What about the carmakers? Can they strike a deal? Maybe. 6 months ago I regarded Uber as being the overlords. Now I'm not so sure. I think Apple is the overlord. Unless Google can hatch a plan with Ford or GM. Then there's the Tesla factor; Musk has yet to show his hand. I think he's interested in autonomous taxis, but doesn't want to piss off his driving loving customer base just yet. At some point he's gonna bail from the car world to concentrate on Mars. Will he sell to apple when he's done with earth? What were those talks about?"
SelfDrivingCars,31p7iz,fricken,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"How is Apple the overlord? They seem to be banking on people wanting to own and drive cars.  Learning to drive a car and getting licensed is a pain, car ownership is going to be dead within a couple of generations.  Google will likely not want to work with the car manufactures or less likely only one of them, the rest will likely be lining up at Uber's door to sell SDCs."
SelfDrivingCars,31p7iz,mcilrain,0,Tue Apr 7 13:26:21 2015 UTC,Building an electric autonomous car will be as simple as building legos in a few years. Once the sdc systems have been optimized to a satisfactory level companies will start licensing. You can already get good in-wheel electric motors for around a $1000 ($4000 for the whole vehicle). It will be possible to build a reasonable car with off the shelf parts very soon.  SDC as a service is a huge market but what's more interesting to me is what comes after. This technology has the potential to totally transform our world and not just ferry us from A to B.

There is a tiny population of people who might have the ability to do this, and almost none of them are building vehicles with 'off the shelf' parts, they are rebuilding or modifying industrially manufactured vehicles.  There are extremely strict/rigid regulations about the components that can be combined to form a vehicle that can legally be operated on a road shared with other drivers."

If the fee does not become close to zero, someone will create an open source version and make it available at no cost. Imo, Uber's business model is indefensible.   Probably the only reason Google/Apple haven't been quick to upgrade their maps app is that Uber is a convenient fall guy as they fight all the messy legal battles to get ridesharing legalized throughout the world. Once that process begins to wind down, it won't be long until there is some big disruption coming to Uber.  Uber total value =  $40 billion. Apple's cash on hand = over $100 billion. When the race to establish self-driving taxi fleets in all cities begins, Google/Apple be able to afford a relatively huge fleet."
SelfDrivingCars,31p7iz,Sidewinder77,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:10:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe now it's easy for someone with big pockets to replace uber. But once UberPool - their ridesharing service runs on fully force - it's much harder - because it becomes a networks effects business(the more people requesting trips you've got, the more sharing of trips can happen, leading to cheaper trips).   And networks effects businesses are very hard to compete against, even for well resourced companies, as the Google+ case showed us.   Maybe that's the reason only now we hear about problems between Google and Uber - up until now, Google waited for Uber to do the dirty work, but now, when uberpool starting to become risky, they will attack."

SelfDrivingCars,31mwv6,DaffyDuck,15,Mon Apr 6 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"From a quick look at the patent, one example is cows in the roadway (Fig. 15).  This would work for an autonomous vehicle where the driver cannot take over control, either because they are unlicensed, unable, or not present. If the SDC drives too slow for too long, and it's not waiting at a traffic light, this will alert someone in a command center who will look at the car's cameras and take control to get around the obstacle.  Another example I can think of is a vehicle that is broken down in the center lane of a highway. An SDC would just start ""following"" the broken down car, and would have no way to know that it's not moving any time soon. With the technique described in this patent, the SDC waits awhile without moving, then asks for help from the command center."

The problem is that unlike a burger or sunbathing, where you can anticipate demand and have the burgers and fries cooking, and still be able to put the sandwich together however the customer wants (no lettuce, extra mayo, etc.), pizzas have to be made to order before cooking. Even with no cars ahead, you would be waiting close to 10 minutes from the time you ordered. One you start having cars in line, it gets longer.

I've said in the past though that I think Google isn't working on that problem since they may already have a solution like Delphi's on the back-burner and just choosing to focus on navigation at the moment. Perhaps they are collecting more data before moving forward on it.. who knows.   One surprise: The variation in lane markings across states and communities. Some had wide white stripes, others had narrow yellow ones. Some were new, some were faded, and some were marked with raised bumps. Delphi will have to further train its cameras to detect all kinds of lane markings, since that's one way autonomous cars keep themselves centered in a lane, Owens said.   I think the surprise must be for the writer of the article, I mean, really? Hell, there are some roads around me I can barely even make out lane markings....   close to 99 percent of the time...

However, one of the biggest hurdles to SDC adoption is the public's fear of getting into a car driven by a robot.  If a car manufacturer was willing to guarantee their product for say 5 years, then they could start an ad campaign about how SDC are so safe we will give you 5 years of no-fault insurance for free.  People pay thousands of dollars for insurance, highlighting that the cars are so safe that we won't require you to have no-fault insurance both reassures consumers about safety while also demonstrating how much money SDC cars will save you besides just comparing the retail price.    Once only SDC cars are on roads, I agree companies will focus on getting MSRP as low as possible.  However, while we are transitioning, guaranteeing the safety of SDC while backing it up with free insurance (which should be really cheap for manufacture as SDC should nearly end accidents) will go a long way to reassure the public of SDC safety."

I agree with these negative aspects, but the fact of the matter is that suburbs are hugely popular for a host of reasons - and the suburban population has voted with their feet and their money.  In suburbia fully autonomous vehicles could significantly impact on social isolation (some that are disabled, seniors, hit hard times would have more reliable and affordable access to road transportation) and the consequent boredom.  Where there is a choice then those that want walkable neighbourhoods will be able to choose walkable.  And those that want suburbia will be able to choose suburbia.

People can say what they want but the courts will decide and unless there is some sort of libertarian revolution it will stay that way for the foreseeable future.   Software updates will not be released with bugs. The testing cycle for autonomous vehicle software will be much longer than that of your average website. If buggy software is released you can expect the company that released it to go out of business pretty swiftly. Not only because they get sued but because they will lose all consumer trust. The stakes are too high.   Sure there are challenges but most of the really difficult ones are regulatory at this stage. Only time will solve those once we collect enough data points to make informed decisions.

SelfDrivingCars,315y2f,lawrencekraussquotes,3,Thu Apr 2 23:16:59 2015 UTC,"But what happens in the beginning when only 5% of cars are self driving.    The SDCs are being developed with this expectation. A change to SDC is going to be very slow and gradual (unless the government interferes).   What happens when the said car gets in to an accident with a driven car. Sure it's the drivers fault, but people are dumb and they will blame the new technology.    Blaming a SDC would really be no different than blaming another driver for an accident. Police investigations and so on would happen to determine the real cause.   If for some reason it is proven that the technology is at fault, then the same thing happens when normal cars are faulty. There have been many instances of this in the past - faulty breaks, faulty airbags, etc. The companies pay significant fines and do recalls.   But then the manufacturers will try to prove that their autonomous vehicle is perfect using the data recorder. Then the people will say that the car makers are spying on them and taking away their freedom.    This seems pretty extreme. What is a SDC going to be recording (assuming it comes to this)? Things like speed, vehicle maintenance, maybe something to the extreme of a dashcam.   Yes, some people will cry like babies. People cry about everything. But all of that information being available is a positive.   If they for some reason cross a line - like recording conversations in the car or something? - laws fix that. (If the competition doesn't. If I know car A records my conversations but car B does not, I'm probably buying car B.)   What happens when a software update is released and there is a bug?   This is unlikely, but of course not impossible. Because of the risk factors, regulations regarding SDC are going to be extremely strict.  Just like Airplanes. These are mostly automated these days. No one is all that concerned about auto-pilot bugging out.  But assuming it does happen, same thing I mentioned above. It's treated the same as a defective car.    Or worst what if he cars get hacked.   Well, first off that would be a felony. So it's a criminal investigation unrelated to SDC. The question becomes more along the lines are SDCs safe enough to handle something bad happening - airbags, etc.  You have to keep in mind all of these bad things discussing are being mentioned as failures of the technology. Let's keep in mind that there will be other types of failure too. What if a deer runs out in front of the car? A SDC isn't guaranteed to be able to stop in time. What if a tire blows out and it runs into a light pole?  All of these are normal factors.  The real meaning of all of these questions is ""who is responsible for problems when there is no driver"". And that is a fair concern, because if the driver is no longer in control then they feel they are not responsible. (Despite a blow-out of a tire or a deer isn't really the driver's fault either when they are in control...?)  Do the manufacturers of the cars absorb that responsibility? Partially, yes. They will be scrutinized to have even stronger safety features and quality assurance. But the others? That's probably going to shift to insurance companies.  But is this typical system going to remain in place? That's probably the biggest question! What if Google creates their own car insurance provider? Suddenly insurance becomes a part of a typical car buying process, just like a warranty. Maybe even just becomes a part of a warranty. I imagine a lot of car insurance companies are just going to go out of business (for more reasons than this).  Odds are manufacturers will just be the insurance purchasers instead of the drivers. Drivers will file 'insurance' claims to the manufacturers when things go wrong."

They could go from nothing to dominating the in car entertainment model off the back of this with ease. While Apple in car entertainment is stuck in expensive level 3 personally owned cars that look exactly as they do today. The poor man has the better experience and service than the middle class man. 'Premium' get's turned on it's head.   The growth market is actually inside the shared fleet fully autonomous vehicle. For this new emerging market of in car entertainment, there is one clear winner and it isn't Apple. So they have to be able to provide something that rivals Google, like for like.   Apple have a enormous reserve of cash. They will likely spend tens of billions of it in acquiring businesses to rival Google. The problem still is that Google are the leaders. There may not be much demand now for partnering up with Google. But as soon as fleet vehicles are available on streets, everyone will be throwing themselves at Google. At which point Google will be saying, yes you can license our tech, but we also want you to use Android and other Google products and services.  This is THE new revenue stream for Apple. Apple like people to own as many devices as possible. People really only want one or two and in the next few years technology will bridge the gap between devices. So that is a declining market for them. But there is hope, the emerging market. Billions of people coming online. Shame they have no real plans. Plans like Google.

Well considering Google's work in this area, seems like Apple might have even now, missed a great opportunity for dominance.   So why is this? Well Steve Wozniak will probably tell you.

SelfDrivingCars,314lgb,fricken,2,Fri Apr 3 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"I suspect that the longer a player waits to begin developing an autonomous OS, the less time and effort it will take to develop it.   Google's current development vector (which is top secret now) is completely different from the paradigm that was established for the Darpa challenges. They basically started again from scratch, using far more machine learning, and far less hand crafted AI.   I would love to know specifically what Google's doing, but cluefinding is possible by going through the research that has emerged from various universities and skunkworks, where we've seen solutions emerge to all the really hard problems of teaching a car to drive itself demoed at least as proof of concept. Vision in poor conditions. Gesture and facial reconition. Pathfinding in dynamic and complex environments- All of this is machine learning based now.   Of course, the other really fun fact is that Google is now testing 3 million miles per day in simulations. It took them what, 3 or 4 years to do their first 700,000 miles on real roads? Sufficient Simulations weren't possible when Google began. The massive datasets needed to train Deeplearning systems weren't available.  We're seeing these Kurzweillian exponential trends play out before our eyes. As computers improve, and as the methodologies for developing an autonomous OS become better understood the barriers for developing an OS from scratch have been falling- going from impossible a few years ago to probably not that hard a few years from now for a company with the means that Apple has. The longer they wait, the easier it gets.   There is no being ahead (at least not by much). No secret sauce."

Do you hit the child, or do you hit the other car?  The first problem I have with that analysis is why do people assume that a human would make a better choice in that situation? Second, the answer is simple. You hit the child. The child is at fault so there is no reason to endanger either yourself or the people in the other car that you would hit. The entire accident would be recorded. The child would be declared at fault and no lawsuit would be filed.  The issue here is that people don't like having to think about making difficult decisions. They want to pretend that such things won't happen, and when they do, they want to have the sudden immediacy of it absolve away the guilt. Coldly planning out which is the best of bad choices ahead of time is not something people want, or like to do. However our discomfort is a problem with us, not the technology."

Third, other than trying to brake, your car is under no obligation to swerve out of the way to avoid the collision. In fact if my layman's understanding of the law is correct, if you swerve to avoid an accident and hit someone else, you are the one at fault even if the person you were avoiding was was initially in the wrong."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,SplitReality,5,Wed Apr 1 20:25:54 2015 UTC,"While I agree with you with respect to legal obligation, an automated system can actually do more sophisticated calculations than that, based on (potentially) factors like the make and model of vehicles involved, velocity and angle of collision, etc., with the intent of maximizing human survival and health, rather than minimizing legal liability."

The reality is that this is already a settled matter. You are in the wrong if you swerve to avoid an accident and cause another. This isn't simply a matter of insurance as you state, but a matter of following what the law prescribes for you to do.   The only option that would impede SDC adoption would be to program the cars to swerve into oncoming traffic thus increasing the likelihood of injury to the passengers and the legal liability.

What if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second. Your self-driving car can brake all it wants, but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision. Now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road?  What would probably happen in that situation, is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other, and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians. That seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too. Should the car protect the driver at all costs? The driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car. Would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who aren't involved with the car?  The reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations, is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality. These conditions will have to be explicitly set in the ""rules"" (logic). This isn't an area where we can say ""we'll see what happens"". These kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and I think that's what people get hung up on. A programmer will have to sit down and make the decision ""let my driver get hurt"", ""let the other driver get hurt"", ""let the bystanders get hurt"".

I'm obviously simplifying a lot as it would have to be some more careful constraint based logic, but in my opinion you most likely won't have a car populated with a huge rule set for elaborate scenarios."

For example, Google's Project Tango has  2x on-board computer vision processors that do the heavy lifting and number crunching. That data is then exposed to the higher levels.

The main difference is low level software can run much faster than high level software.

What if I cross the road in what feels a safe distance to me, but the car feels otherwise?   You are going to have to be more specific. Braking distance at 30mph is 14 meters. The real question is how much can a car swerve at that speed while braking. Can a car swerve both left and right effectively in one movement. Because swerving only works if the object you are looking to avoid is stationary or moves in the opposite direction to the vehicle."

YOU are still thinking of an SDC (a true SDC) as being a solitary computer controlling a solitary car. like YOU driving YOUR car.  this is not how it would work.  First YOU can only see one very small thing in your FOV at a time. you have to move your vision plane around to see anything else.  SO when you see someone walk out in front of you 1-2 feet in front of you YOU can not do anything about it. you won't even have time to swerve or even release the gas pedal.  this is an IMPOSIBLE scenario for the SDC.  the SDC will SEE you 100 or more feet back. it will know you are their and it will be tracking you.  and get this. this is the important bit.  SO WILL EVERY OTHER SDC IN RANGE VISUALLY OF YOU.  so the car coming the other way WILL ALSO SEE YOU.  the two cars will coordinate with each other. share data they will BOTH SEE YOU.  it will weight your existence as a probability and what it think you COULD DO and constantly dozens of not hundreds of times a second RE SEE YOU RE MEASURE YOU and RE PREDICT what it thinks you will do and SO WILL THE OTHER CAR.  when you move the cars will already be ""acting"" before your foot gets 6 inches into the road BOTH Cars will automatically begin to ""act""  if they can brake they will brake. if they must ""swerve"" the car that was to hit you will swerve to miss you and coordinate with the other car to also swerve so it does not head on the other SDC.  this will all happen at CPU CYCLE SPEEDS. so insanely fast it will be like ""the flash"" or ""superman"" casually walking around at superspeed while the slow beings (you) move around like molasses. slow and easy to predict.  it really can be THAT GOOD.  you would have to get pretty damned creative to trick on.  SDC's will do what drives like me do but on a whole new level of ""insane""  EADD. Extremely aggressive defensive driving. part of this driving is being proactive about POSSIBLE dangers.  for example doing everything you can to avoid getting ""INTO"" a situation where you do not have 2 outs available at all times (2 directions you can ""go"" to avoid some trouble)  seeing a possible hey what if this guy does this or that situations and proactively ""changing"" your circumstances in advance even if he does nothing so that ""IF HE DOES"" your position to alter or avoid is improved.

I was driving home from egg harbor. almost 60 mile drive home from work. brother wanted me to drop him off so the expressway made more sense than 206 since I would have to backtrack once in PA to get to his place while if I took the express way he was ""on the way"" and would get home faster. hell as long as he is paying the toll fine by me.  We are chugging down the expressway I am doing 60 in the right lane (65mph PSL)  this road has HUGE arching onramps.  so I see a car ahead on the onramp. I slow down a little and then more when I check my six.  brother asks why I am slowing down. I take the opportunity to explain my EADD driving to him.  I say see that onramp car? he is going to be an intercept (we will arrive at merge at the same time) see the car passing me now? he would have intercepted as well if I did.  SLAM on the brakes swerve hard left behind the passing driver still max braking take the shoulder and prepare still max braking to dive into the grass median if I need to. Brother bounces off the door window and slams into his loose restraints and goes WTF.  I just point forward.  Now here is what happened. when the onramp car arrived at the straight away WHAM 3 deer standing in the lane. he aggressively swerves left into the right lane to avoid the deer BARELY missing the passing guy who just passed us.  PRECISELY where my little geo metro would have been had I not preemptively predicted NOT that this would happen but that ""IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN"" that spot is where I did not want to be. it would have been a geo sandwich between those two much larger heavier cars. it would not have been a good night. if we even would have survived it.  I would have had zero outs. I would not be able to go right as that would be into the merging car. I would not have been able to go left as that would be into the passing car. its a 49hp 3cylinder geo metro in 5th gear. ""go faster"" is non existant in any useful time frame. and braking would not have been sufficient in that timescale.  0 outs. the only way to secure outs was toe CHANGE the odds. slow down now so I am not BETWEEN the cars at the single most dangerous point. the merge point.  so I planned in advance by slowing to let them arrive ahead of me. by checking at all to even notice the guy on my six passing me!  to check ahead that the shoulder and median are clear in case I need to use them.  do it long enough and this all just happens instinctively in your subconscious. you just ""do it"" without thinking so much about it when you do it long enough.  AND SDC with its perfect memory scanning and raw SPEED and higher resolution sensors and no distractions can do this so much faster than ANY person can and do it FURTHER AND FURTHER away into the future AND coordinate with other cars.  ideally in an SDC environment my car would slow and so would the passing car so that we would all reach the merge point ""staggered"" slightly without us the passengers even realizing it.  even if they all drive perfectly what if something happens their sensors can not see. tire blows out causing a car to swerve. anything.  EADD programming would solve this and we would never even know.  BTW the passing car.? never flinched. either he had depleted uranium balls or he never even SAW anything and never knew how close he came to being whacked by that car swerving to miss the deer."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,nerys71,0,Wed Apr 1 19:33:39 2015 UTC,I know. I always argue that. I am not arguing people or cars should swerve. Just highlighting how pointless swerving is at 30mph. While at 70mph in multi lane traffic it is extremely dangerous. That is how pile ups are caused. Not by someone braking and staying in their lane.
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,DVio,-1,Wed Apr 1 19:49:06 2015 UTC,swerving is not pointless it works quite well if you know how to do it know how to keep control of your car know the limits of your car and yourself AND are paying enough attention (and this is the important bit and why swerving IS usually pointless) in advance to be able to react to something you need to react too.  if you are reacting at the last second. NO swerving will usually not help you. just brake as best you can.  it is interesting to note that when ABS brakes came out rear end collisions when down but head on and other collisions went up.  before you would slam on the brakes swerve but still go straight because you were sliding.  ABS retained wheel grip control so you were able to swerve and get whacked another way because you had no idea where you were swerving into.

None of the situations you described are unique to SDCs. There are already laws governing such actions. The only difference is that people are uncomfortable with the consequences of those laws being so clearly demonstrated by being coded into a car. If a car does what is legally expected then there is no issue.   I don't think the situations are as complicated as people make them out to be. These cars will have a much greater situation awareness than any human. If something unexpected enough happens that causes a crash then you can hardly blame the SDC. The car's core logic doesn't have to be any more complicated than swerve if a reasonable open area is available, otherwise break. So for instance if the car detected a cliff to one side, or pedestrians, or an oncoming vehicle in its potential escape path, it would just break.    There simply aren't a lot of good options if a car swerves into your path. A human wouldn't have the reaction time to do anything anyway. At least with a SDC you have a chance."

SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,Deadeye00,9,Wed Apr 1 19:41:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I did not know that. Still it should be a non-issue.  From the link you provided...   However, on appeal, the court ruled that the jury should be able to decide whether, based on the facts and circumstances of this case and the characteristics of this child, Ted could be held to have been negligent.    The child stepping out in front of the car should have automatically caused the car to brake faster than any human could. All of which would have been recorded. I'd say that that should be enough mitigating circumstances to avoid fault.  However, this brings up another important point. None of this is unique to SDCs. The legal system has already developed laws and rules for dealing with these cases. Presumably these laws and rules are considered the right thing to do in such circumstances and automated cars will be able to carry out that expected behavior better than any human could.    The only issue I can see is when the law makes a distinction between the correct action based on some criteria that a SDC can't determine. For instance if the law was to say that you should crash your car into another car if it was a child in the way, but hit the pedestrian if they were an adult then that would cause a problem if the car could not determine the age of the pedestrian. I'm no lawyer, but I have a hard time believing such an interpretation of the law would be correct. Regardless of the child's tort liability, there has to be a presumptive defense that a driver doesn't have to endanger their life by getting into a head-on crash in order to protect a child."

These are the typical stopping distances for humans. An autonomous vehicle doesn't have a human thinking distance. They also apply the breaks accordingly. Unlike a typical human. In many scenarios, the vehicle may have even slowed down by 5mph in anticipation due to the nature of the environment. Such as dense parking of cars by the side of the ride. Can the vehicle avoid hitting a child that runs out into the road. Well if that child runs out within 14 meters of the car, then almost certainly not. But what is really important is the speed in which the vehicle hits the child, the weight of the vehicle and the makeup of the impact zone.   The fact is, an autonomous vehicle is superior to a human. It can detect that person behind an object that a human can not see. If using an array of sensors. It can anticipate their path. So before a problem arises, the vehicle will have already adjusted it's speed and or positioning.   The problem is humans are thinking as humans when it comes to these scenarios. An autonomous vehicle is not a human driver."

SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,SplitReality,2,Wed Apr 1 19:08:40 2015 UTC,"Second, the answer is simple. You hit the child.   You apply the brakes as much as you can, you keep the car straight so the brakes are effective. You mitigate the damage as best you can.  In most situations like this, veering around the road isn't a great idea. It leads to a loss of traction and very possibly a loss of control. Just nail the brakes, let the computers (ABS etc.) stop the wheels from locking."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,phaeilo,3,Wed Apr 1 19:18:12 2015 UTC,"While I agree that that is a perfectly acceptable strategy, a couple of times in my life I've swerved to avoid hitting something when breaking alone wouldn't have worked. Although I  can't think of a situation where a SDC would be blamed for breaking rather than swerving.   The best criticism I can think of would be if a SDC failed to recognize a potentially dangerous situation in the first place and slow down. For example imagine you are driving along and you see some kids off to the right at the bottom of a snowy hill holding sleds. You might conclude that there is a chance that another kid might come sledding into the street at any time and slow down as a precaution. A SDC might not be able to pick up on those cues."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,ExtremelyQualified,1 point,Wed Apr 1 09:57:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe not at first. But those things could be ironed into the AI eventually. And maybe there's information that other vehicles round the corner can broadcast for your car to receive, like a kid sleding down a hill, that you will have no way of knowing. We may initially have better judgement with visual cues, but we won't have the network of sensors sharing information about the surrounding areas through wireless communication.  You made an interesting point though."

If out of 100 situations a self driving car is better than humans in 90% of them, will people still focus on that other 10% for reasons not to use them. After all it will be those 10% that will get all the news coverage. No one is going to know about the 90% of accidents that were prevented other than a general reduction in overall incidents."

SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,the_bacon,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, which is why I say the problem isn't with the SDCs making the decision, but with humans being explicitly forced to deal with the issues because we have to program the SDCs ahead of time. It's emotionally easier for us to pretend that such situations don't happen, and then write to whole thing off as an unfortunate accident when they do happen. It is the premeditation inherit in programming SDC's software that trips people up."

SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,MomentOfArt,4,Wed Apr 1 15:01:19 2015 UTC,"the answer is simple. You hit the child.   I disagree, to a certain extent. If it's at all possible to avoid the kid, I think that would be better. e.g. you could swerve onto a footpath if it's empty, or use a parked car or guardrail for ""braking assistance"".  But I would also accept your conclusion because that's probably what a human driver would do (panic, slam brakes).   Ideally, the two SDCs would see the kid approaching the road, and talk to each other about the best way to act prior to the event.   e.g. ""hey opposing car, a kid is about to jump in front of you! I know you can't see it yet, but trust me, you should brake hard and swerve 2m to the right. I'm braking and moving to my left to give you space""  edit: I live in a left-hand side of the road driving place."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,SplitReality,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:16:15 2015 UTC,"Other than the issue that /u/toomuchtodotoday brought up that potentially the law could dictate that you do different things based on the age of the person, I think the law states that if you swerve to avoid an accident, and end up causing another one then you are at fault. Therefore the car shouldn't swerve. Of course I would assume that if the car detects a safe way out of the accident, then it would take it.  As I pointed out in another comment, none of these issues are unique to SDCs and already have a body of laws and litigation dictating what the correct course of action should be. If a car is programmed to follow those standards then there shouldn't be ant problems.   The issue is that people have a problem specifically deciding that a specific innocent person should be injured over another ahead of the fact. They are much more comfortable with such decisions being made in the heat of the moment by a human being because you can more easily sweep it under the rug as just being an accident. That's harder to accept when the decision was made years ahead of time on a computer somewhere."

The cars will detect the child moving toward the street long before a human would and can run through all contingency plans and find the best one. In addition, the car will already be driving conservatively based on data (obscured sides of road) in a way that most humans wouldn't.   I suppose there are rare situations where something changes very suddenly and the laws of physics now dictate that something is going to get hit, but even then, the car can plan faster than a person could and minimize the damage."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,mofosyne,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure it is as clear cut as that. Human and SDCs have to make assumptions about how others will act in order to function. After all, on a road without a divider any oncoming car could swerve into your lane at any point. The only way to proceed is to assume that they won't.  Likewise a pedestrian on the side of the road could jump out into the road at any time too. Traffic isn't going to slow down because someone might jump into the street. However children are an exception to this rule. Most people will be more cautious around children. A possible issue with SDCs could be that they might not be able to classify moving objects into categories fine enough to distinguish an adult from a child.  Even if that is the case, the superior sensors of a car should be able to make up the difference. They'll be better at some things like not having blind spots, or being distracted. They'll be worse at others like not being able to recognize a situation developing that would cause a person to suddenly run into the road, like for example another person about to throw them a ball. Taken as a whole though, between the better sensors and reaction time, SDCs should be much safer."

If self-driving cars make fewer mistakes over all than human drivers, then we side with the better system. So what if they can't make moral decisions? Morality isn't part of driving. Not hitting things is. I don't need a car that weighs the life of a child as more important than the lives of everyone in two cars. I need a car that doesn't swerve me into oncoming traffic every time some human decides to throw themselves in front of it. Not throwing themselves in front of oncoming cars should be something everyone understands. Expecting cars to make moral calculations regarding the relative value of life based on years lived is insane."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,Ranlier,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:53:20 2015 UTC,"Years ago I took a shortcut through a residential neighborhood. I'd never driven down those streets before, but assumed they could lead me through to the next main road that I was seeking. Inherently I understood there was an additional risk of children playing and kind of mentally weighed the risk against my time saving benefit.  I was at or below the speed limit since I was having to wind my way about, and as I had said, I was not familiar with my path. Each turn was an arbitrary gamble.  Then I saw a tiny glint of white from under a parked car. I had zero clue what I saw, but my mind did a natural calculation of trajectory and predicted an eminent collision. I don't remember hitting my breaks, but I locked all four wheels. (before the days of ABS)  As I stood there at a standstill my heart sank into the pit of my stomach as a little blond haired girl continued her walk into the street. This toddler was barely over bumper height, and if not for the fact that her mom dressed her in white shoes that morning, she most certainly would have met her fate.  I've thought 10,000 times over what made me slam on my brakes that day. And my only answer is that I felt I had to with every fiber of my being. – For all those who are involved in the decision making abilities of these automated systems. I can only hope they will find the algorithm for gut-feelings."
SelfDrivingCars,310eq3,CallMeOatmeal,5,Wed Apr 1 14:05:34 2015 UTC,"Nice story.  Actually we know what gut feelings are. It's when our unconscious mind recognizes something unexpected is happening before our conscience mind can figure out what it is.   Our unconscious mind is constantly trying to predict what will happen in the future. When those predictions come true the mental pathways that produced them are strengthened and we learn.  When that prediction is substantially different from what is happening, alarm bells go off causing your conscious mind to focus on that area. Those alarm bells is what we call our gut feelings. It's your unconscious mind saying ""Hey something unexpected is going on. I can't tell you any more than that right now, but you'd better start looking out for danger""  In your case I'm pretty sure a SDC's sensors would have noticed the child and started braking before you ever could."

Or at the very least, strictly standardized roadside markings that would allow computers to triangulate position to within inches.  It's not that unlikely a prospect. Those road reflectors in between lanes cost a couple dollars a piece. Mass produced magnets (or more likely RFIDs) could easily match that price point. The real costs will be installing them. But eventually it will simply be part of how roads are constructed, and be a minimal additional expense.  edit: Here is a team that thinks laser scanning and stored maps will be enough to navigate through snow.

Why?  Humans aren't some special, magical, thing; we take inputs, interpret them and respond.  If we don't need the infrastructure, what leads you to believe cars will?  Your solutions might be easier, but I think they would be a waste for, by the time we deploy it widespread enough for it to be useful, there is a good chance that someone will figure out how to have a car navigate like we do."

Machines will navigate in a way that is fundamentally different and has fundamentally different challenges. Computer vision is an extremely difficult problem and the main reason driverless cars do so well at it is that their vision problem is so specific and roads are so standard. Lane detection is relatively easy for example. Snow is really a completely different problem and honestly a significantly more difficult one, which is why we haven't seen a solution yet.   My point is really just that your point of ""humans aren't magic, machines will replicate us"" is valid but we are so so far off from that and that is not at all what these pieces of software are attempting to do."
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,lawrencekraussquotes,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"Computer vision is an extremely difficult problem and the main reason driverless cars do so well at it is that their vision problem is so specific and roads are so standard.   I don't agree that roads are standard.  Some are lined, some are not, some are dirt, some are paved, etc.  And Audi has already done a race on a dirt road.  Clear, a ""standard"" road is far from a requirement.  Second, ""computer vision"" is not extremely difficult.  Have you ever used photoshop and seen how well it can find the edge of shapes in a picture?  I know, cars have to do it in real time, but it also does not need to do it so finely; a very rough understanding of where the edge of the road is is plenty good.  We have been making great strides in computer recognition, such as with OCR, facial recognition, biometric interpretation, etc. . .  Third, you say it needs general AI, but then turn around and say the problem of ""computer vision"" is ""so specific.""  Why would you need general AI for something so specific?   Snow is really a completely different problem and honestly a significantly more difficult one, which is why we haven't seen a solution yet.    While I agree, the fact that it is all white does make it more difficult, you act like this is a problem we have been addressing for a long time, yet we have only been doing so for about a decade, and can argue that it has only been a strong focus for half that time.  The technology is still in its infancy.  It would take at least a decade to deploy systems in every road (and we would probably never do so on dirt roads), and google believes that they will have all of their current issues (snow/ice/heavy rain/interpreting hand signals) by 2020, which is probably before completely autonomous SDC will even be legal in most places."
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,heltok,1 point,Tue Mar 31 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"Roads are way more standard than many much harder vision problems and that's why it is doable. Similar with your photoshop example, edge detection is really easy. Facial recognition is cool, as is ocr but again, specific problem. Almost all faves look almost the same with variations on feature distances and hand writing also has uniformity.   I meant general AI if you plan to have them act like humans in how they navigate.   Again, it's a very hard problem to do it with snow which is why we haven't seen a solution. It is not an impossible one. I expect it will be solved with sensors that see through the snow."
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,davidrools,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:00:21 2015 UTC,Road reflectors generally aren't used in places with lots of snow because the snowplows wreck them.

SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,RoadDoggFL,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:48:54 2015 UTC,Snow and bad weather is a very big problem. They can't get to commercialization without solving that. I doubt it is commercially viable to exclude a product from such a big market (most of first world countries are in a temperate climate). Plus what if someone wants to drive to Chicago or New York?
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,TwoMoreDays,6,Tue Mar 31 18:06:12 2015 UTC,If what you are saying was true then it would be reflected in what the automakers and Google are doing.  None seem to care about snow.  Maybe Volvo does but that is it.  The first systems will not work in snow.  Maybe the 2nd gen or 3rd gen will but not the first.
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,olibln,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:39:49 2015 UTC,"I know it doesn't snow in Mountain View but from what I understand ""snow"" is not just one problem. Snow can mean snow covered road (partially or fully) which makes detecting the lanes and path difficult, decreases traction and potentially decreases ability to visually recognize other objects. It can also mean ""snowfall"" which renders the LIDAR sensors useless. Now, every problem that snow makes is not ""snow-specific"". Dirt on the road or bad road marks (lane detection), wet or slimy conditions (low traction), low visibility or fog or night time (object detection) and rainfall (useless LIDAR) all create problems that need to be solved before commercialization. Do you suggest that Google will launch driverless technology that only runs on clean, dry and clear roads and only when the sun is shining. Coz not many people (or automakers) will buy that (and not many legislators either) Just because we don't hear it on the news doesn't mean no one cares. It means they haven't solved the problem. Either because it's way down on the list and not working on it yet or they just can't do it yet."
SelfDrivingCars,30wdk7,kerbuffel,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:48:57 2015 UTC,"I'll point to this bit from Brad Temploton    Nobody has worked really hard on driving in snow yet. There are lots of markets where snow is not an issue, of course, or where telling people they must take the wheel during snow is not a deal-breaker. Still, in the academic community there is promising research on techniques to handle snow, such as ground penetrating radar. In the event those techniques don’t pan out, one sure approach is to do some relatively inexpensive additions to the road in places with snow, such as low cost magnets punched into the road, or special poles at the side of the road — which are already used in many areas to let the snowplows figure out where the road is when it’s snow covered.  There are issues with very heavy rain and blizzards, but new generations of LIDAR are showing superior results there, and frankly rain that is so heavy it blinds the sensors of a car is probably not rain you should be driving in, though you could choose to take the wheel of a regular car in such situations.   As for commercialization, I was looking for another Templeton blog post but can't find it, so I'll have to wing it.  Tesla is introducing is software update this summer for freeway driving and made no mention of snow. Will it work in snow? probably not.    Google is planning to release their tech as a service in limited areas under limited conditions.  One of those conditions will be snow but they will probably not be releasing it in an area with regular snow.  There are lots and lots of places with limited snow that will provide significant revenue potential."

The officer went through a red light without his sirens on and was hit side on by the autonomous vehicle that had a green light. Would be interesting to break down the BMW system.

So in dark rooms we could be getting some dodgy deals with local government. If you own a car in a major city, you should be very concerned if you genuinely want to keep your car.   People often talk about how people will get ripped off by profiteering businesses such as Google or Uber. You should probably be more concerned with local and state government.

SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,Doofe_N7,20,Fri Mar 27 12:15:29 2015 UTC,"xpost from /r/videos. Their comment thread here.  There was a big study similar to this a few years ago, where they outfitted 100 cars with full sensors and cameras. They found a lot of crashes were due to inattention, and specifically to people paying attention to the wrong thing, i.e. checking their blind spot and missing that the car in front had slowed down. If I'm remembering correctly, they also found that falling asleep at the wheel was a bigger problem than previously thought.  These types of crashes are great arguments for lane departure warnings and forward collision avoidance/warnings."
SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,JoseJimeniz,4,Fri Mar 27 13:27:01 2015 UTC,"specifically to people paying attention to the wrong thing, i.e. checking their blind spot and missing that the car in front had slowed down.   I've noticed this frequently in the back seat when other people were driving. It's never resulted in an accident but it certainly has created some close calls. The issue is that many people only look about 100 meters down the road ahead of them and don't pay attention to what's maybe a half-mile or further ahead that could cause problems. And that's simply the product of lackluster driving instruction."
SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,Quality_Bullshit,2,Fri Mar 27 19:39:16 2015 UTC,"I discovered many years ago that is the result of the speed limits. That may sound glib but it actually was true.  I was driving a company car and I was nervous about exceeding the speed limit while way from home (in a foreign country). I would stare at the speedometer - glancing up occasionally to look at the road; I wanted to make sure I was not speeding.   Then, while driving the car, and staring at the speedometer, I noticed the car had a cruise control. While staring at the speedometer and glancing at the road I would also try and look at the speedometer to try and figure out how to use it. I managed to turn it on, and then set it, and the car held the speed.   I then realized I could stop staring at the speedometer instead was able to look up at the road.  I'll never forget the sensation of what happened next. All of a sudden I could see everything. I could see for miles ahead of me. I could see all the traffic far ahead of me. I could see the oncoming traffic. I could see traffic behind me in my rearview mirror. I could see everything.  It was then that I realized that everything would be so much safer if I did not have to worry about speed limits. That's when I realized that the speed limit itself is dangerous. If drivers were able to focus on driving rather than focusing on an arbitrary, artificially low, limit: the world would be a place."
SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,Quality_Bullshit,3,Sat Mar 28 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time! When I actually stop and think about it, having speed limits so you have to constantly stop and look down at the speedometer really does take your attention off the road."

SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,CWSwapigans,-6,Sat Mar 28 04:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yes. Until we get into the specifics and practicality of such systems. As I have said in my other comment (which on this sub in general people don't seem to understand) is you don't get a system to supplement a humans driving. What you end up getting is a system that fights with the driver for control. Drivers become lazy and de-skilled and over reliant on systems that are not full proof. These systems are designed to intervene at the last possible safe moment. So what we actually may find is people getting themselves into even more situations. Overall accidents and deaths would come down. But not significantly. Not anything like when the  vehicle is in full control. Because not only is a fully autonomous vehicle more prepared, it also doesn't get itself into these situations."
SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,smallfried,11,Fri Mar 27 13:50:54 2015 UTC,"I kind of anticipated your response, which is why I was careful to specify warning systems rather than control (the collision avoidance stuff today normally reacts as late as possible, so I don't think anyone actually relies on it when driving). The little research out there has shown that when you automate both latitudinal and longitudinal control, drivers seem to have trouble staying vigilant. The theory is that this will sometimes lead to crashes when the systems fail, but I haven't seen any evidence yet.  I was confused by your comment:    Drivers become lazy and de-skilled and over reliant on systems that are not full proof. These systems are designed to intervene at the last possible safe moment. So what we actually may find is people getting themselves into even more situations.   How would one become lazy and deskilled if the system only intercedes at the last moment? Are you saying I wouldn't get practice at crashing? I would have to rely on the system's collision avoidance to kick in, but if that only happens at the last possible moment, I can't imagine anyone truly relying on it."

Let's actually focus on humans as they are and not how they are supposed to be. Look at the video again. Almost all of them panics and swerves the vehicle. You think  that these human drivers would simply just sit back and not attempt to regain control? They would be throwing their limbs all over. Turning the wheel. Hitting numerous pedals.   Remember the post where  you were confused  about Google asking drivers to pay attention when testing the vehicle. They explicitly told people to pay full attention. They monitored them and no one did.   You say you have not seen any evidence. Right. But you are aware that multiple organisations have conducted various types of tests, and it does not look pretty.

SelfDrivingCars,30hfac,thedeadlybutter,5,Fri Mar 27 18:49:13 2015 UTC,"You're hitting a few different points here, but I'll try to respond to each.   Remember the video posted here testing three different vehicles at varying speeds. Collision avoidance systems. Some of them still ended up going into the back of objects.   I don't recall the video, but I'm assuming you're referring to the results of IIHS testing of ADAS systems. My memory is that some brake but still collide, although for some systems that was the objective, to lessen the collision. But point taken, systems sometimes fail.   Let's actual focus on humans as they are and not how they are supposed to be. Look at the video again. Almost all of them panics and swerves the vehicle. You think that these human drivers would simply just sit back and not attempt to regain control?   I think—and I'm sorry but your comments is kind of hard to follow—in your scenario the car is programmed to move back into the lane if it drifts out. A driver would rely on this to work and not pay attention to the car's position, and when the system fails, the driver panics and over-steers back into the lane. Because that person is now fighting with the AV over control of the steering wheel, the over-steer is worse than before, causing a crash. Also those lane departures become more common because they are relying on the system. Tell me if I'm misunderstanding.   I understand the issue with Google, and I wasn't confused. I was taking issue with the fact that they were quoted as saying they had ""mastered"" highway driving when they were clearly still in the testing phase.   But you are aware that multiple organisations have conducted various types of tests, and it does not look pretty.   I was a little vague in my comment about evidence. What I meant to say was that I understand there's evidence that shows driver inattentiveness (I linked to it elsewhere in the thread). Although inattentiveness suggests that there will be more crashes, I have not seen direct evidence of more crashes.  So here are the arguments I think you have been making in this thread:   Semi-autonomous systems reduce driver attention.  This may cause additional crashes. This may cancel out many (but not all) of the safety benefits from lane keeping. Because control of a semi-autonomous vehicle is shared, there may be some circumstances where this causes problems as the driver is fighting the computer over control. Safe fully-autonomous vehicles are preferable to semi-autonomous.   There's evidence supporting #1, I don't think anyone disagrees with you on that. Number 2 is likely, but there is not yet evidence to my knowledge. If you have some, please share! Number 3 is the same situation, but more arguable than two because we don't really know how many crashes these ADAS systems are preventing. Number 4 is certainly possible, but I'm thinking that's very limited to steering control, which I was careful to avoid mentioning in my original comment so I'm not going to touch it here. And I don't think anyone disagrees with number 5, but I feel that semi-autonomous vehicles can add value right now.  And just a general comment, when I'm responding to something you posted and posing polite clarifying questions while agreeing with you several key points, maybe respond with something like: ""Yeah sorry I wasn't very clear in my original comment. What I meant to say was X"" instead of seeming frustrated with having to deal with a lower life form (""Honestly, it is as if no one has even watched the video.""). It's just unnecessary."

GM has been studying human factors of semi-autonomous vehicles for awhile. They have found that when you automate steering (or Limited-Ability Autonomous Driving Systems ""LAADS"" as they call it), people start doing much riskier behavior. They read, they play with phones, they look away from the road for longer periods of time. Here's the conference paper [PDF]. Google has mentioned coming observing similar problems with their vehicles, but never published. So automating lateral control does introduce some danger, and /u/naturalredditor has a point.

Or it might cut the accident rate in these cars to a tiny fraction of what it was before them. We just don't know what the result is until it's researched.

SelfDrivingCars,309ews,Airazz,2,Thu Mar 26 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"you just don't want to be charging any cars at peak demand which is right around 5pm.  See the graph on page 4 of the Austin simulation.  The Ann Arbor simulation showed similar high peak at 5pm.  See page 39. So you can start re-charging cars at like 9 am after the morning peak until 4 pm.  Look at Page 12 of the austin simulation I linked for more on charging.   Most currently available BEVs for sale in the U.S. have all-electric ranges between 60 and 100  miles (e.g., the Chevrolet Spark, Ford Focus, Honda Fit, Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and Nissan Leaf).  For these, the U.S. EPA (2014) estimates typical charge times (to fully restore a depleted battery)  to vary between 4 and 7 hours on Level 2 (240 volt) charging devices. This could pose a serious  issue for all-electric BEVs in an SAV fleet, but not much of an issue for the Tesla Model S  (which enjoys a 208- to 265-mile range and a charge time of under 5 hours when using a Level 2  dual charger [EPA 2014]) or plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs), like the Chevrolet Volt, Honda  Accord Plug-in, Ford C-MAX Energi, Ford Fusion Energi, and Prius Plug-in Hybrid.  Furthermore, fast-charging Level 3 (480-volt) systems can charge large batteries in under an  hour, so SAVs that need more frequent daytime charging may need to rely on these devices. Of  course, some time is required to develop the automation technology and legal frameworks  needed to successfully deploy SAVs. In the meantime, battery charging times, BEV ranges and  costs will improve, along with deployment of fast-charging facilities and remote inductive  charging devices (allowing SAVs to self-charge wirelessly [MacKenzie 2013]).   Seems we'll need Level 3 (480-volt) charging"

For a fleet of just 15,000, that is 321.76 miles each vehicle everyday.  That is without calculating any fluctuations in demand.

SelfDrivingCars,309ews,strike2867,2,Wed Mar 25 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Many considerations. They estimate the cost (operation) to be as little as $0.15 per mile for a 2 seat fully autonomous electric vehicle. That is for a $6,500 vehicle with $2,500 worth of SDC tech. Google have stated that their tech will cost around that, so that is accurate. Reports about the trajectory of battery pack costs also align with the study too.  The average vehicle life currently is 250,000 miles. So even if the vehicle in the study linked was twice as much in total, it would still only add less than $0.04 to the per mile cost. Electric vehicles and also autonomous vehicles are supposed to last longer for various reasons. While someone operating a fleet will want a vehicle that can last as long as possible. So expect the mileage life to be extended.   As for:   Wouldn't it be cheaper to have your own, personal SDC, since you won't be paying extra money to generate a profit for someone?

They are comparing apples and oranges. As in the $0.15 per mile example naturalredditor linked below. They compare a theoretical $9,000 electric two seat mini vehicle with a $27,500 gas guzzling 5 seat sedan, neglect to factor in profit for the fleet vehicle, and conclude the former is less expensive. No kidding. I don't think it's a reasonable comparison though.  A misunderstanding of the concept of one shared vehicle replacing X number of privately owned vehicles. It's true that one fleet vehicle might be able to replace 10 or more privately owned vehicles on the road at any one time. This helps with space devoted to parking, it doesn't help much with reducing vehicle costs as a vehicle driven 100,000 miles per year obviously has to be replaced much more frequently than a vehicle driven 10,000 miles per year. At any rate vehicle depreciation doesn't account for the bulk of cost of operating a vehicle.    Obviously if you're in a situation where you're paying a lot of money for parking the math changes. It should also be noted that using fleet vehicles has its own advantages, so cost is not the only factor."

Obviously we don't know yet quite how powerful the autopilot will be, whether it will be able to switch lanes without human input, and when it will be fully legal to stop paying attention to the road, but it looks like my dream is edging closer to reality. Let's see what comes first, autonomous fleets or me sleeping during the highway drive.  Before you say it, I am aware of the fact that the first SDCs will start driving people around Dec of this year at 25mph on public roads, I posted in that thread."
SelfDrivingCars,309ews,strike2867,-1,Wed Mar 25 20:46:26 2015 UTC,"You might want to stop writing like a douchbag! ""Like a baby playing with spaceships"", what? Are you twelve? Grow up!   The first cars with limited autonomous capabilities are already on the road! An example is the Tesla Model S. The Tesla Autopilot software will be upgraded most likely in June and this update will give the Model S the ability to drive on freeways without driver input. Googles Astro Teller who's in charge of Googles autonomous car development said just a few days ago that their autonomous cars could have been used sold and used by normal people a couple of years ago! Tech is maturing at an astonishing speed!"

SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,bartturner,3,Wed Mar 25 09:20:07 2015 UTC,"What am I not getting about the importance of protecting pedestrians?  It seems that everyone is always crying how important it is to save pedestrians, but I haven't heard anything like ""rampaging drivers now targeting pedestrians, injuries up 9001%""  edit: to be clear, getting hit by a car is bad, but why is that an issue now?"
SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,m6hurricane,6,Wed Mar 25 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"It's not new and not just Google - Volvo have a system where a pedestrian-type impact fires the hood up on shallow airbags so the victim lands on a metal-and-airbag oreo instead of just the hard hood.  Basically we've sorted safety for the people inside; now it's about being a good citizen.  In Volvo's case, the whole ""zero fatalities"" program.  But you have to admit, a frustrated Googlecar-gone-Skynet rampage ramming people with a big squishy airbag would be adorable."
SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,andygates2323,5,Wed Mar 25 17:28:02 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the euro makes have something similar at least for cars sold in the EU. They passed a pedestrian safety law a few years back that prompted development of them.
SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,iroll20s,3,Wed Mar 25 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"Pedestrians are soft 'targets', colliding with pedestrians will hurt the pedestrians far more than the car. Car designers is designing the front of the car to minimize and soften the impact to reduce or eliminate damage to people in front if the case.  Maybe money and insurance payout is part of this, but safety is an obvious and huge part of car design, for both people inside and in front of them.   It seems you don't understand why pedestrians should be protected from cars hitting them? The obvious answer to why ""everybody is always crying how important it is to save pedestrians"" is because people are in fact not disposable! And we are not built for cars hitting us or crashing into us! We are soft and very easily damaged compared to cars, and cars should be designed to do as little damage as possible when hitting people! You should really reconsider the way you think of the people outside your car...."
SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,Steinrik,-1,Wed Mar 25 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"We need to redesign the pedestrian..  Start with shifting tickets from cars to pedestrians, jay-walking will cost you $50 (or $10 over 5 months). It's enough to sting you into using crosswalks when they are available but not so expensive that it will ruin someone's life. SDCs that see it can report it.  SDCs need to be aware of areas where no proper crosswalks are available and take measures to make a ""bubble"" around them. Since there are no proper crosswalks, people can cross anywhere. These areas don't usually have the same amount of pedestrian traffic so it shouldn't be a problem.  This thus far should cover everyone, a pedistrian can have nothing but a pair of shorts and navigate traffic safely. But the vast majority of us have personal electronics on us now, there's no reason we can't take this further.  With a smartphone, you may be able to cross a street without a crosswalk legally if you signal with your phone first. A smart phone running a GPS application may be able to do this for you automatically. Good reasons for this are things like getting on a bus that's about to leave, or if traffic is low enough that crossing the street won't cause an interruption.  let's assume that SDCs aren't going mainstream for another decade or so, that means theres plenty of time for this to be an inexpensive option at the optometrist or for sunglasses. Navigateing traffic with these on should be a fairly easy task. Follow the green line, wait for the holographic wall with the hand on it to disappear. The glass can also be monitoring to see if it can guess what your going to do, if it detects that you just lost balance and are falling into the lane, it can transmit an emergency stop request to them so your head isn't squashed under a tire. If your mood is low, it may cause cars driving by you to slow down and be ready (you know.. in case you try to throw yourself under one of them) assuming that your walking on the near side of the sidewalk. This also allows cars a heads-up that your walking on the side of the road in a non-sidewalked area.   With all this in place, i think it would be hard to do minor knee damage. A full on car hit would be unlikely enough to forgo adding an expensive delicate and often stolen part to the exterior of the car where it would be exposed to the elements."
SelfDrivingCars,308h3z,Nakotadinzeo,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"You've got a lot of ideas, some of them even quite good one. But everybody walks, and not everybody is 'competent' in dealing with the kind of systems you mention. And people is in fact just the same as we were thousands og years ago. People don't change, ask anybody that has tried to make people have...   Tickets is a bad idea. Tickets would mean that there would have to be police along most roads and crossings to make a difference. I think we agree the police has far more important stuff to do. It would be stupid to expect SDCs to report something like this, re surveillance state and human rights.   SDCs work by making a 'bubble' around the car with their sensor array, abs will of course far safer for pedestrians the SDC would detect and avoid them automatically. No need for signaling.   SDCs will enter the market in a couple of years and go mainstream in ten years or maybe even less. There is so many huge incentives to make this happen, for example very reduced number of accidents, greatly reduced numbers of killed and injured, insurance cost will drop, car cost will drop while tech and comfort increases, far more efficient use of roads and infrastructure, ability to work while commuting, and so on... SDCs will impact out lives in countless ways!"

We have a lot of poorly designed streets for both pedestrians and bicycles and real problems with people who are intoxicated both behind the wheel (which obviously wouldn't be an issue with a self driving car) and in the street. One of our roads, which I happen to live next to, had four pedestrian deaths in the first five weeks of this year.  Pedestrians and cyclists are very vulnerable, so a self driving car having extra safety features for those groups seems like a good thing to me."

Manually deploying outside airbags would literally throw anybody away from the car after hitting the car, instead of protecting them... An airbag is in fact a rather powerful little 'bomb in a bag'!

SelfDrivingCars,2zwims,StarManta,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:03:46 2015 UTC,I don't think they're live streaming but here's this:  http://delphi.com/delphi-drive  edit: and this https://twitter.com/delphiauto
SelfDrivingCars,2zwims,joshamania,5,Tue Mar 24 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"Hm, didn't they just show in the video that they had to manually take the wheel due to construction? Seems like the last 10% of autonomy is going to take 90% of the effort."
SelfDrivingCars,2zwims,neuromorphics,3,Sun Mar 22 19:42:28 2015 UTC,That is usually the case. I think the world is going to have to adapt around these cars as well. For instance construction sites would be required to install a small sensor that tells all cArs in the area to avoid that spot.
SelfDrivingCars,2zwims,fib16,3,Sun Mar 22 21:58:23 2015 UTC,Probably it'll just show up on their GPS as a work zone and they'll know to avoid it.
SelfDrivingCars,2zwims,sutniotibahmansiuqsu,2,Mon Mar 23 00:06:13 2015 UTC,How about bad weather?  I've heard that doesn't bode well for some of them.

Use WeatherSignal to help 1 day?  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.opensignal.weathersignal&hl=en   WeatherSignal uses native phone sensors to measure local atmospheric conditions, which are then displayed on our live-updating weather map.   Join the world's largest crowdsourced weather project.   You can report when it rains.  That's some hefty cooperation though."
SelfDrivingCars,2zx7mc,cybrbeast,3,Sun Mar 22 17:49:27 2015 UTC,Neat but I don't see any benefit in spending 1/4 of the video showing off the screens that show desktop backgrounds. What about the tech??
SelfDrivingCars,2zx7mc,asudan30,2,Mon Mar 23 05:51:37 2015 UTC,"True. The laser projectors are really cool, brought something like it up a month ago as a way that cars could travel faster than the current speed limit and still be safe by showing pedestrians when they can cross."
SelfDrivingCars,2zx7mc,TheAngryPlatypus,2,Mon Mar 23 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"These type of vehicles will come with built in features like this and the vehicle will be marketed as premium. When in fact due to the nature of the tech sector and devices, you will want non built in features. Ooh an LED strip. That will be $2,000 extra.   Also, can people stop downvoting submissions for the sake of it. I mean look at the current submissions. You would think that anything other than Elon Musk or Tesla is pointless."
