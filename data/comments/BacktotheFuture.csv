BacktotheFuture,3dkbrs,JohnLocke815,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:52:23 2015 UTC,... This is one of the strangest questions I have ever seen. DVD is 720x480 and 5.1 DTS sound. Bluray is 1920x1080 and 5.1 DTSHD Sound. Far far far better quality. A Duel-Layer DVD can only hold 8.5gb while a Duel-Layer Bluray can hold 50gb and as a result the quality can be better. A Bluray can even have up to 4 layers if needed!

If he was worried that having gasoline before it was invented would disrupt the space-time continuum, then why did he build a steam-powered ice-maker before it was invented?"
BacktotheFuture,3bwb5l,jonnichols,7,Thu Jul 2 18:51:18 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of people talk about this in their search to find a reason to hate the third movie.  Some people can't accept that all three movies are good.

BacktotheFuture,3bwb5l,fujbuj,3,Thu Jul 2 19:37:06 2015 UTC,Yep.  Definitely would be a time paradox as the Marty standing there in 1885 didn't bring more gas because the letter didn't tell him to but now the letter would be telling him to so the universe implodes or something.

BacktotheFuture,3bwb5l,fujbuj,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:43 2015 UTC,"The way I understand the time paradox theory, in simple terms, is if the event has already played itself out in your universe, changing the outcome of that event would create a paradox.  Having said that, in the first movie, Marty really probably should have instantly been erased from existence the very moment he altered his parents' future rather than the gradual effect they went for.  Another issue that always bothered me was in Back to the Future 2.  Old Biff went back to 1955 and altered the future by giving young Biff the Sports Almanac, yet he was able to return to the unaltered future in order to return the Delorean to Marty and Doc."

Lots of movie and TV cars. All of em can be hard to find.  Personally if you just want one and can find it for less than ten bucks just get it online.

Since The Walking Dead, Telltale's games have been more dramatic interactive fiction style adventure games, rather than more comedic, puzzle-based adventure games. The puzzle-solving type of adventure game really fits BTTF better.  Sadly, I'm pretty sure they won't continue it.

BacktotheFuture,394umc,farcough187,3,Tue Jun 9 07:15:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with much of what yellowsubtab says, BUT: the car is not heavy. it's 2700lbs (compared to many modern cars that are over 3000lbs.  Remember, the stainless steel panels are all non structural.  they're simply affixed to a fiberglass tub that sits on what is effectively a modified, epoxy coated, mild steel, Lotus Esprit, double Y frame).  its slow because its ""under-powered"" with only 130hp from the factory due to the nature of the 2.8L PRV motor and US emission laws from the late 70s and early 80s.   at slow speeds, it is a bit of a tractor to turn, but once at any speed above ~10mph, its actually quite nimble.  at highway speeds its quite light and responsive to drive.   due to the motor, 0-60 is ~10sec (8.7sec on the euro spec cars because of less emission restrictions).  If you end up driving one thats been modified, it will be faster.  getting to 88mph is doable, but it wont be like Marty escaping the Libyans :). also, the stock speedometer only goes to 85mph (again US laws from the 70s/80s... thanks Carter administration!) so you may have to do your best guess (or get a speedometer app on your phone).  you do recline a lot more in the seats and have your legs straighter than in most regular cars.  that's part of the sportier (aka: Lotus) design and because John DeLorean (who was a little over 6ft) wanted the car to be designed to fit him comfortably."
BacktotheFuture,394umc,dj_harbor_seal,2,Tue Jun 9 17:01:54 2015 UTC,Well I was saying that based on the one I drive. It's been turned in to the movie car so it's about 3500lb. But yeah usually  a stock delorean  isn't all that heavy.

Pretty much every piece  of metal that goes on that car is on top of that cover. The custom made cover is also solid 1/4"" aluminum. So even just the cover is heavy."
BacktotheFuture,394umc,yellowsubtab,2,Thu Jun 11 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine owns one, and let me take it out once with this warning: ""DO NOT SPEED! Everyone scopes this thing out on the road, so if you're flying down the freeway, you're not sneaking by the cops when you do it. Just cruise and you'll be fine.""  He also started filling his gas tank at night so he'd have less people stop and ask him about the car when he was in a hurry. lol Super fun cars to drive though."
BacktotheFuture,394umc,Mercuralis,3,Tue Jun 9 19:27:12 2015 UTC,"They are tough to drive but fun. No power steering means when your not moving have fun busting your ass trying to turn the wheel. That is one big heavy  ass car. You gotta use alot of strength to turn the wheel if your not moveing. If you have ever driven a car with no power steering than you know how difficult  it can be. Pretty much the faster you are moveing the easier  it is to turn the wheel.   The bucket seats make for a nice comfortable  ride but if your like me and not my crazy boyfriend who like to recline the seat as far back as possible ( which in the delorean  is pretty  dang far back ) You can pretty much move those seats any where to make your self comfortable. Being a two seater car there is so much room to strech your legs that if you push the seat all the way back, depending on how long your legs are you may not be available  to touch the pettles.   The car handles like a typical  car. They exelrate rather slow so don't worry petal to the metal won't send you suddenly  flying down the road. Since the delorean  is heavy it can take some effort to get it to stop. I know all brakes are different with the age of a brake but typically it takes a little more time and effort  to stop a delorean then a new fancy car.   Also remeber you are in a very low profile car. You are going to feel like your sitting on the ground. Large trucks will tower over you so try not to be intimidated by them.   I think that's all I can think of.  Have fun deloreans  are great cars to drive. One of a kinda."

I knew Part I by heart back in kindergarten, and had taken every electronic device apart in the house in my quest to build a flux capacitor. It was all I talked about day in and out.   We were kinda poor back then though, so I didn't see Part II until the last week that it was showing at a dollar movie theater. I didn't expect to see Part III until it came out on VHS. My mother picked me up from school and said that we were going to the grocery store. When we pulled up in front of the theater, I almost lost my mind. I don't think I blinked at any point during the movie.   I still remember being mortified when the train crashed through the DeLorean and not really getting over it despite Doc showing up soon after. For the next few weeks, I kept trying to ""think fourth dimensionally"" by running my Hot Wheels up and down the edge of the coffee table and imagining a track appearing once they passed through the invisible time portal.

Given, it's not perfect, but it makes me think that this issue here is that it's just a weird angle combined with the 'special effects' (it being transparent, the light coming from inside, etc) and the odd body shape of the car.  Or at least that's what I'm telling myself.  I trust Drew Struzan to have not goofed this one up."

We all obviously know now that it's a Delorean, but looking at the poster without that bias, you can see that you have no idea what sort of apparatus he is standing partially out of.

BacktotheFuture,35e579,darthevil99,10,Sat May 9 15:57:54 2015 UTC,It's possible that a person in the Rolls Royce was directly involved with the 2015 Cubs. Your reasoning is sound.

His windfall judgment from the accident allows him to invest in hover technology, self-drying clothing, holography, etc.  Marty's not hitting him in 1985 is why our 2015 is as lame as it is."

What if one of their star players was never born because Marty avoided the crash?  The current Cubs roster has dozens of players born in 1986 or later.  Said player wouldn't even have to have been the son of the Rolls Royce driver, it could have been anybody connected to the incident in some way: a doctor or nurse at the local hospital, an insurance agent, a lawyer if there had been a lawsuit, the police officer responding at the scene, the victim of an unrelated crime that the police officer couldn't respond to in time because he was busy at the site of the Rolls Royce crash, a former bandmate of Marty's who decides to settle down now that his music career is dead..."
