DrugStashes,3dpfts,hey420,3,Sat Jul 18 04:34:07 2015 UTC,Mouth watering...  How do you plan to use the oxymorophone?  You can snort the oxy but I think those opanas are tamper proof unless you do some crazy iso solution
DrugStashes,3dpfts,hey420,2,Sat Jul 18 07:18:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately these pandas are the ""abuse-proof"" Endos. About half the time I'll just eat them to stay well, but the other half the time I snort them. I don't do an iso extraction or use the crisping method (although I've tried it before). I just use a dremel or sometimes a ped-egg and go to town. Once it's all ground down to powder, I'll usually add just a tiny pinch of baking soda as it seems to helps reduce gelling a bit. The key is to snort as lightly as possible, and not to do huge rails at a time. You'll always get some gelling in your nostrils, but it definitely works.  To be honest, dope is my DOC, but I was offered a deal on these that I couldn't turn down. Plus, it's always nice to have variety; I hear it's the spice of life. Heh."

Crisping works decently well too. No matter what, though, snorting opana will always be superior to eating them, even for the ERs. 40% versus 10% is big enough where even if you only get half of an ER up your nose properly, it'll still be twice as strong."

It is my view that no government or group should be able to legislate what one puts into their bodies. If I was in your position, I  would be very torn by arresting people; knowing that I am ruining their lives and their families. It is not an attempt at getting people to live happily and healthy without drugs. The fact is all drugs aren't going anywhere until there comes a cure for both boredom and pain. Do you feel you are collectively winning the war on drugs? Because there is a plethora of evidence supporting the fact that it is an utter failure, costing billions, and waging war on people.. not so much a war on the drugs themselves. It seems to only feed the penal system and is largely weighed on keeping private prisons full of minorities or un-desirables. Are you content arresting people and throwing them in jails / prisons, or would you personally prefer a different approach? More along the lines of treating addiction as a public health issue, and utilizing harm reduction as much as possible.. For over 40 years, the negative cost of the drug war has been impossible to measure. Positive results? I'm not sure there are any. What are your thoughts?"

I haven't actually tried those tabs yet. I've had no desire to take 25-B NBOMe again in well over a year and a half; mainly because of my plethora of other psychedelics that I'd rather try (that also happen to be much safer to experiment with at higher dosages, IMO).  The last 25-B tabs I had were laid with 1.3mg each, and ironically, they were actually from Psychedelian's good friend/old-partner, J1m1th1ng (who died early from an RC-stimulant induced heart-attack over a year and half ago). Anyways, those tabs were some of the best tabs I've ever possessed/taken.  Honestly, the only tabs I've ever owned that I thought were stronger/more intense, in both 'head-fuck' and visuals, were my H-o-S's 275ug (she stated actually closer to 300ug) 'DMT Machine-elf' LSD blotters. In other words, those 1.3mg 25-B tabs from J1m1th1ng were INSANE. With weed, the OEV were easily a 9/10 every single time (and this is coming from a guy whose tried at least 15 different psychs).   If Psychedelian actually used to work with J1m1th1ng, and knowing how incredible J1m1th1ng's 1.3mg 25-B blotters were, then I'm sure Psychedelian's 1.1mg 25-B blotters are almost just as good, if not completely indeferentiable."
DrugStashes,3cnhpj,unalert,-1,Fri Jul 10 08:16:08 2015 UTC,"you should really use the term Hallucinogens, rather than Psychedelics. I'm pretty sure the NBOMe series isn't considered a psychedelic, rather just a euphoric hallucinogen."
DrugStashes,3cnhpj,unalert,2,Sat Jul 11 05:40:37 2015 UTC,"If we were talking about deliriants or dissociatives, then I'd agree with you, except we're not. We're talking about the phenethylamines, 2C-X derivatives, the 25-X NBOMes.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe. Literally, the first sentence ""25-I NBOMe... is a psychedelic drug"".  Actually, if anything, it's even more of a psychedelic than LSD, mushrooms, 2C-X, etc. 25-I NBOMe is the first 5-HT2A receptor full agonist (one of, if not ""the"", main psychedelic receptors). The other 25-X NBOMes are all really strong agonists (still much stronger than practically every other psychedelic's).   Uhm, I'm not trying to be a dick, but if you're going to GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to type a comment to correct something, at least fucking make sure that the amended information you're putting out there is actually correct.  It's analogous to someone correcting a correctly spelled word with an incorrectly spelled word.  Something like,  Me: ""That was euphoric."" You: euforik.*  Anyways, unless you have some somrt of scientific literature stating that the 25-X NBOMe's aren't actually considered psychedelics, then you really need to stop spreading misinformation. Just because they're relatively unsafe and new, and different from the more traditional psychedelics, doesn't mean that they're not what they're pharmacologically classified as..."
DrugStashes,3cnhpj,autowikibot,2,Sat Jul 11 07:07:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, you had the complete opposite experience with the NBOMe series than me and many other people I've known have. For me (and the many others) it didn't produce any actual psychedelic effects, as we don't consider simple visual effects (OEVs/CEVs) to be ""psychedelic"", rather than just an effect of a hallucinogenic drug. I suppose the phrase ""drugs affect everyone differently"" applies greatly to this kind of situation.  Back when I ran an incredibly popular drug blog, a lot of people would ask me ""I want to try psychedelics, but don't know which to start with. In your opinion/experience, which is the easiest to experience?"" the NBOMe series would never even so much as cross my mind as an option. Even for experienced psychedelics users looking for something more intense. I guess you are in the minority of people who seem to actually purchase the NBOMe series to experience it, rather than sell it as LSD. (which really is the truth, as that appears to be the only reason people order it nowadays -- mostly due to the amount of which I see it on the streets)  Also, its strange, because even though you claim that you weren't trying to be a dick, you kind of were. also, getting really defensive like that isn't exactly easy on the eyes either. Anyways, its cool that you can enjoy something as dangerous as the NBOMe series and not experience any negative side effects. A few of my friends (irl) wanted to do the same but ended up in the hospital after having several seizures, even on a dose as low as 1000mcg.

It was discovered in 2003 by chemist Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin, who published his findings in his PhD dissertation.  The compound was subsequently investigated by a team at Purdue University led by David Nichols.   The carbon-11 labelled version of 25I-NBOMe, [11C]Cimbi-5, was synthesized and validated as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) in Copenhagen.   Being the first 5-HT2A receptor full agonist PET radioligand, [11C]-CIMBI-5 shows promise as a more functional marker of these receptors, particularly in their high affinity states.

They mediate both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The serotonin receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter serotonin, which acts as their natural ligand.  The serotonin receptors modulate the release of many neurotransmitters, including glutamate, GABA, dopamine, epinephrine / norepinephrine, and acetylcholine, as well as many hormones, including oxytocin, prolactin, vasopressin, cortisol, corticotropin, and substance P, among others. The serotonin receptors influence various biological and neurological processes such as aggression, anxiety, appetite, cognition, learning, memory, mood, nausea, sleep, and thermoregulation. The serotonin receptors are the target of a variety of pharmaceutical drugs, including many antidepressants, antipsychotics, anorectics, antiemetics, gastroprokinetic agents, antimigraine agents, hallucinogens, and entactogens.   Serotonin receptors are found in almost all animals and are even known to regulate longevity and behavioral aging in the primitive nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.

DrugStashes,3aw6v0,I_almost_fell_for_it,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"Judging by the English/French on the label, I'm guessing Canada. Could be wrong."
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,meta_frequency,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:46:30 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad about the dosage. I've actually seen that dose before and understood that not everybody is the pharmaceutical fanatics that others on here might be. Or alchemists or connoisseurs of leisure or whatever you want to label yourself, fine with me. Just be polite and/or civil and diplomacy begets knowledge to reign supreme. Back to my point, I heard from an actual friend of mine that she was prescribed 0.25 alprazolam and I laughed but she never lies and doesn't do drugs at all really, so I have every reason to believe her. She said she knocks out like THAT! Lightweight style."
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,dispensation,2,Sat Jun 27 12:22:47 2015 UTC,Yeah they do 0.25mg alprazolam. If you want a real laugh in the UK the highest a doctor can prescribe is 0.5mg. They do not have higher doses than that at any legitimate pharmacy.  But even 0.25mg can be enough for someone without a tolerance who isn't abusing their medication. I took a few months break from benzos then took 5mg diazepam and it had me full on benzoed out for the entire day. I was off my face from 5mg diazepam. Couldn't believe it when just a few months ago I took 50mg just to chill.
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,SgtFaecesProcessor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, you can get alprazolam in the UK? I know the do diazepam. I thought they might do one or two other benzos but didn't realise they did alprazolam.   I've been taking several week long breaks from benzos and struggle to get decent effects without strong doses. 5mg diazepam would do nothing for me. Though, now I've read your last sentence that might make more sense. Maybe I need longer breaks and one dose can make quite a difference to tolerance. Care to elaborate on your break a tad?"
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,dispensation,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:56:56 2015 UTC,You can't get it from the NHS but a private doctor can prescribe it.  I stopped using all benzos for a few months as I said. A single week would do nothing especially if you used a benzo with a long half-life such as diazepam. But give it a month and your tolerance should shoot right down just like mine.
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,SgtFaecesProcessor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:12:33 2015 UTC,I see. Makes some sense.  Honestly I don't keep count any more but it's likely a month. Maybe 3 weeks. Probably more
DrugStashes,3aw6v0,dispensation,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:42:09 2015 UTC,Private doctors can pretty much prescribe you anything. You can't get Adderall from the NHS either but you can from private doctors. Those scripts are ridiculously expensive though.  If you've not used benzos in around three weeks you should see a noticeable drop in tolerance.

DrugStashes,3avruo,dispensation,-1,Tue Jun 23 23:20:21 2015 UTC,it metabolizes in the liver into multiple different kinds of benzo's and all those different benzo's have different half life in the body. many of them have extremely long half life (comparatively to other 'clean' benzo's) . it doesn't have any euphoric effects. it sucks imo
DrugStashes,3avruo,pitne,2,Wed Jun 24 06:31:45 2015 UTC,"Valium is lovely man. It's not a hard hitting benzo like Xanax so if that's what you're used to then yeah you'll be disappointed. But it's soft and relaxing, sometimes that's what you need especially from a benzo.  You can take too much Xanax and blackout wake up in jail the next day. You can take too much Valium and just melt into your sofa wake up the next day nice and chilled.  Different drugs for different people tho."

Both batches were made the same, except one was made with slightly less Calcium Hydroxide. The batch with less CH was a lot more effective smoked, and the one with more was more effective insufflated.  When smoked (4 - 6 hits of batch #1), it was very cerebral. Aside from feeling achy muscles and a pressure like body load, I had a lot of internal conversation and felt slightly disassociated, but it did also have an amazing effect on appreciation of music coinciding with thoughts. All and all a high ++.  When insufflated (1 .3g line of batch #2), it burned terribly (like eating a spoon of wasabi) for a good few minutes, which did last for a few days but was a lot less painful and more of an irritating feeling then anything. About 4 minutes after dosing I began feeling an intense body load and pressure building in my head that spread through my body, which when getting to my stomach, almost instantly made me begin vomiting intensely. About 3 minutes into vomiting sort of just gave into it and stopped resisting, because intense colorful patterns began forming in my vision into everything I was looking at which made me realize there was no point in fighting the journey I had embarked on. I still felt extremely nauseous and continued to vomit/dry heave for another 10 minutes or so (my perception of time had almost completely gone, although I still understood numbers). As I got sick I watched these intricate patterns form from many rainbow colored lines, constantly moving and changing, sometimes into objects I recognized (like a cat or some other being) and then into fractals that look like objects I couldn't identify, all while these lines formed geometric patterns all around me. Finally as the nausea full subsided (I'd say around 15 minutes after dose), I decided to go for a walk to find a place to urinate (I was outside near a beach with my lovely girlfriend) and as I walked it felt as if I was traveling through space and time but grounded to where I was. I felt all the energies around me, and even saw them flow past me as I walked. I ended but dancing and holding my arms out (like I was flying) while I walked, and looked around constantly feeling and seeing all these colors and wavy vibrations of colored light flowing past. I felt complete bliss, like I was pure in a sense, and that I was completely connected to the rest of the universe around me, although I still knew who and where I was the entire time. I began to come down around 45 minutes in and was back to baseline within 2 hours. There was also pupil dilation until baseline. All and all a very high +++ if not a stern ++++.

DrugStashes,37wjxw,RUSureItsPluggedIn,8,Sun May 31 00:10:33 2015 UTC,Since this is an obscure drug I know I'll get questions about it. Pregabalin is a downer but different from benzos since it's a synthetic version of GABA rather than a drug that makes your brain release more natural GABA. It numbs your whole body and feels euphoric physically and mentally. Not really that sedating. Completely fucks you up even at the prescribed the dose. This is completely uncontrolled and they hand it out here instead of benzos. It is way more abusable than benzos but I would rather have classic benzos that fuck me up less for actual medical use tbh. But if you just wanna get fucked up this is better than benzos. Same withdrawals though.

But with doctors passing out pills left and right, why not fill an extra Alprazolam prescription if it's thrown my way? $5 with insurance is too good of a deal to pass up on 90mg of alpraz, and I might need it someday...  Oh and these are just the 'fun' meds. I'm on plenty that drive me insane."

DrugStashes,37e9rq,throwawaysofardamn,10,Wed May 27 04:42:03 2015 UTC,How is it? I've read that it's not particularly recreational and can sometimes be pretty anxiety-inducing since it's just thc and no other cannabinoids to round it out.
DrugStashes,37e9rq,Flopdy,3,Wed May 27 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"It's recreational if you take like 30-40mg, which would make you feel WAY dabbed out. Never heard of it causing anxiety.  It's mostly used for old folks to get them to eat."

I doubt it since it's pretty common for pressed pills these days to have a 'speedy' element to them. It's what most people prefer, even though everyone says they want 'pure MDMA' I highly doubt they know what pure MDMA feels like.  The batteries for example are a bit speedy (in a good way though) while the UPS are clean MDMA pills and tend to mellow people out a bit more.  Funny thing is that people doubt there's only MDMA in the UPS cause they don't get that crazy energetic push that they're used to."

Though dosing at such a small amount when you generally receive it in powder can be a bit of a hassle. It's also an unscheduled substance."

DrugStashes,35ioeg,alexburrow,3,Mon May 11 01:22:01 2015 UTC,I've been prescribed anti-drepressents in the past that have given me the zombie feeling. I don't have any of that on tianeptine. I don't experience drowsiness or shakes either. You can get a small amount of it for next to nothing. So it isn't a big investment to just give a shot. It does build a bit of a tolerance though so I like to go five days on and two off.

DrugStashes,34cv5k,fig_art,4,Fri May 1 03:55:27 2015 UTC,"zoloft? like the antidepressant?  don't quote me on this but i think xanax doesn't interact with antidepressants. just don't take any other downers (especially alcohol or opiates) with it. weed and xanax is a treat, though. the xanax kills all the paranoia and anxiety that may come with being really high, just makes it so much nicer.  i'm coming down from a trip, i just took a mg of xanax and i'm just kinda waiting for it to kick in so i can pass out. xanax is really more of a tool, than anything to me.   i tried it recreationally twice, 2mg both times. it was kind of fun, yeah, but i just went to sleep after and remembered nothing but a vague feeling of having enjoyed it. it's just a waste, i don't see how people love this stuff so much. but yes, it is very nice coming down from a trip or when you're freaking out on weed or even if you're just having a panic attack. just try not to do it every time you smoke weed, cause you'll kinda have a hard time doing weed without xanax, at least in my expereince.  sorry for the ramblings, still tripping sort of."

DrugStashes,34cv5k,1di6,2,Fri May 1 06:05:52 2015 UTC,"Have you tried CBD strains instead of high THC ones? Klonazepam, Klonopin, and Xanax will cause psychosis on detox if you become addicted.   'Psychosis is a serious mental disorder characterized by thinking and emotions that are so impaired, that they indicate that the person experiencing them has lost contact with reality.  People who are psychotic have false thoughts (delusions) and/or see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations). These are referred to as “positive” symptoms; “negative” symptoms like loss of motivation and social withdrawal can also occur. '   My boyfriend was highly addicted to benzos for about 8 months, tried to ween off of them but it didn't work too well, so he went cold turkey and caused a whole slew of mental issues for about a year. He is finally getting back to normal."

DrugStashes,33qks8,roionsteroids,6,Fri Apr 24 21:14:26 2015 UTC,"Afaik, in Germany it sometimes (rarely) gets used as a sedative before and after surgeries. I've always only seen patients getting Midazolam (Dormicum) for this purpose, but apparently it happens."
DrugStashes,33qks8,pzk72,2,Fri Apr 24 20:18:03 2015 UTC,I've also only heard of Dormicum from illegitimate use. When I first started using RCs a good idk 9 years ago the group of people who sold in per dose quantities would provide Dormicum as a sort of exit pill from psychedelics.   I'm familiar with most over the counter benzo types but all these seem rare to mE. Someone just asked me yesterday if getting rohyphnol was possible. I was saying anytging was possible but didn't think it likely then bam this post.

DrugStashes,33qks8,Eggness,5,Sat Apr 25 04:55:28 2015 UTC,It's only ever really seen in a hospital setting these days because of all the scare about the date rape thing. However research proved that this was completely unfounded as only 0.33% of date rape suspects actually tested positive for it.  Shame because it's a very potent and useful hypnotic. It is still used on a short term basis (mainly for inpatients) for severe insomnia that won't respond to anything else.
DrugStashes,33qks8,RectumToucher,2,Mon May 11 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"Fluni was never really available in the U.S., as it was never approved by the FDA. Dunno what the rape stats are for other Benzos, but it probably makes one of the lowest contributions."

I guess I'll try and sell it, and if that doesn't work out I'll just keep it as a means to acquiring some sleep once my supply runs out and WD starts. Have done so before, if you don't combine it w/ anything else, the Rohypnol works real good simply as a sedative/hypnotic."
DrugStashes,33qks8,RectumToucher,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:39:43 2015 UTC,Don't sell it to anyone you don't know. It's a date rape drug.

DrugStashes,31nxcd,crazyknowscrazy,-7,Tue Apr 7 12:59:28 2015 UTC,Seriously! Weeds all about looks. It just feels way cooler. No /s haha I'm serious.
DrugStashes,31nxcd,Narit,7,Mon Apr 6 21:55:56 2015 UTC,It keeps better in mason jars and I'm pretty sure less of the trichomes stick to the glass than to the plastic.
DrugStashes,31nxcd,Esslemut,5,Mon Apr 6 23:43:05 2015 UTC,and you can scrap up the loose keef at the bottom too
DrugStashes,31nxcd,bagofm3th,2,Tue Apr 7 00:06:10 2015 UTC,And when you open the jar it smells way better than in plastic

DrugStashes,31dlw9,Myrocksrock,10,Sat Apr 4 01:45:23 2015 UTC,Hope you're not in Houston. That is the most common pressing for fake bars around here. Imprint with XANAX and 2 are mostly fake afiak.  Edit: Pfizer does make bars with these imprints but they are very uncommon and older so even if they are legit there is a very good chance that the potency has gone down.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,woodenpipe,9,Sat Apr 4 01:50:48 2015 UTC,"I'm in the NW. The bars dissolved in my mouth and they broke way to easily. I suspected something, but they seem to work the same as my other bars tho."
DrugStashes,31dlw9,woodenpipe,5,Sat Apr 4 02:41:15 2015 UTC,Right on dude I've had mixed luck with pressed bars sometimes they're nothing and sometimes they fuck me up hard
DrugStashes,31dlw9,Aminull,6,Sat Apr 4 02:43:17 2015 UTC,Made me black out and admit a bunch of shit I didn't do.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,username911,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:47:38 2015 UTC,Pressed etizolam.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,woodenpipe,3,Mon Apr 6 02:36:00 2015 UTC,Fake as in they're duds or something else?  I did 2 bars for my first time last weekend that had that imprint and they fucked me up good.  But was first time doing xanax so wasn't familiar with the high.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,woodenpipe,4,Sat Apr 4 01:53:36 2015 UTC,Fake as in someone made a pill that looks like a bar but has god knows what in it. Its perfectly reasonable that you did get some good ones but in my area this imprint is notorious for being fake bars pretty much every time.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,pop-a-cap,4,Sat Apr 4 02:00:49 2015 UTC,"Also pressed bars are often made with a cheaper benzo like etizolam, etc so it could've been fake but still got you fucked up"
DrugStashes,31dlw9,Moonbase1,6,Sat Apr 4 02:01:44 2015 UTC,Lol those Bars look massive. They have to be pressed.
DrugStashes,31dlw9,shooshoodoodoofoe,-1,Sat Apr 4 03:50:51 2015 UTC,They're actually slimmer and shorter than real Xans
DrugStashes,31dlw9,Aminull,2,Sat Apr 4 04:32:53 2015 UTC,^ keyword real
DrugStashes,31dlw9,Corndog_Enthusiast,2,Sat Apr 4 05:23:02 2015 UTC,2 a bar is cool with me. I've done enough Xanax to know what it's supposed to be like. These are real
DrugStashes,31dlw9,pagelock5,-5,Sat Apr 4 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"But you also said they broke up and dissolved in your mouth way too easily, so you're lying. They also wouldn't leave all that white dust on the inside of the bag. Probably pressed etizolam."
DrugStashes,31dlw9,Scobufffff,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:37:56 2015 UTC,They kinda look like mini charleston chews without the chocolate licked off.

DrugStashes,31a2ex,pike184,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:44:27 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be sketchy, you just have to really respect it.

DrugStashes,31a2ex,alienbaee,5,Fri Apr 10 02:26:11 2015 UTC,I was exaggerating. To emphasize my point of how it is usually almost always impossible to  determine purity by looking at a picture.
DrugStashes,31a2ex,yeaheroin,-4,Fri Apr 10 20:33:07 2015 UTC,Does glass look cloudy like these shards? I thought it was clean and proper see through. It can't be that hard to tell the difference between Meth and real glass.

DrugStashes,317xwk,drugsuser,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:23:00 2015 UTC,Jesus. H. Christ. I've never cared about pills because the form isn't nearly as important as the effects. I think the coolest stashes are just the huge ones with a wide variety and/or rare substances. I'd be very interested in seeing what 40-60 RCs looks like; I'm not even sure I can name that many off the top of my head.

DrugStashes,317xwk,Green-PEAs,3,Fri Apr 3 03:11:05 2015 UTC,Only way to find out is to wash the fuck out of it or do an A/B extraction. Appearance means nothing when it comes to blow.
DrugStashes,317xwk,pike184,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:13:12 2015 UTC,True. Usually rocky is a good sign but it's only a sign. I tend to stay away from straight powder but some of it is straight fire. No way to know by looking.

DrugStashes,30aaei,higherfydrant,2,Sat Apr 25 15:19:22 2015 UTC,"an incoming ban :) Also, 2-fma is the best fucking stimulant ever, I wish they would make some long term reasearch on side effects and metabolites, because it is the SHIT. 8 hours fully awake and focused but not drained out, judgement isn't as clouded as with amphetamine, the comedown is not so harsh/aka almost non-existent respectively back to baseline(never took more than 20mg tho) and no hallucinations or other paranoia inducing effects as with amphetamine."

DrugStashes,30aaei,Novelty-Bobble,4,Wed Apr 22 02:32:52 2015 UTC,What the difference between meth and speed in this collection?
DrugStashes,30aaei,Green-PEAs,12,Fri Apr 24 06:03:14 2015 UTC,I would imagine the meth is methamphetamine and the speed is just amphetamine.

DrugStashes,2zutxr,username911,2,Sun Mar 22 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"The estick seems to be a solid choice of battery, (although my eye was on the istick 50W), but the nautilus is kind of crummy when it comes to prebuilt atomizers. The tank is great, but the coils ain't. If you're sticking to prebuilts anyways, it's a good choice because of the new BVC's, but rebuilding will alway be better according to most people."

Vaped bud will have lost most of the active compounds when it was vaporized, but the remaining ones aren't ""activated"" in the plant material afterwards.

DrugStashes,2y8l0n,SgtFaecesProcessor,2,Thu Mar 12 07:21:36 2015 UTC,How do you find 5-MeO-MiPT and 2C-E? And what would you compare them to? I would ask about 4-AcO-DMT but the general consensus I've come across is it's like a cleaner version of shrooms which basically tells me everything I need to know really. Do you weigh these out or are any volumetrically dosed?   65 label per A4 page?
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,Flunkie_Drugs,3,Sat Mar 7 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"5-MeO-MiPT compares fairly to LSD. I've found it less manic and more forgiving, but with that also less impressive all together. None the less, it's a legit substance that is enjoyable to use. It has the 'mathematical problem-solving' nature of LSD, without getting invasive by turning into a lunatic carnival.  2C-E is one of my least favorite substances. It is one of the most powerful 2Cs, but I've found it very cold-natured and uncomfortable. There's a distracting bodyload and none of even the most impressive leaps in logic really feel important. However, many rave about its effects, and I can't say it's a disappointing substance; it's just not for me.  4-AcO-DMT is supposedly indeed a lot like mushrooms, but I actually never tried the latter! I prefer the 4-AcO-DMT vibe over any other. It feels personal; a celebration of my life and a soothing focus on appreciating the moment.  I weigh out most substances with a milligram scale. I have dissolved etizolam (and previously alprazolam) and AB-FUBINACA in Propylene Glycol at the moment, as their dosages are below 10mg.  The label sheets contain 80 labels each, heh."

DrugStashes,2y8l0n,neveroddoreven-,5,Sat Mar 7 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"It is (well, was) 5 grams of a gray sandy powder originating from South Africa. By weight, it costed about as much as ketamine used to cost (~$35/g), but a dose of methaqualone is over 4 times as high as a solid dose of ketamine.  It has a lot of volume for 5 grams. The full amount didn't fit in a 5mL vial, thus I had to dedicate one of the 30mL pill pots to it, which it fills about 1/3rd. In contrast, 5 grams of ketamine shards does fit in a 5mL vial!  Due the fairly large volume, you might find yourself needing two 00 capsules for a single (oral) dose.  As expected, it has a foul smell to it that reminds me of an elderly home, but it's not strong enough to really be bothered by it. I have not (yet?) tried vaporizing or smoking it*, which may result in a much more unnerving smell.   * I'm having trouble finding out whether methaqualone is supposed to be smoked or vaporized. Supposedly, it is ""sprinkled on weed"" in South Africa, but I'm not sure if it then burns with the weed or vaporizes like sandwiched DMT in the process."

If you search for 'amber vials' (amber is the brownish color) on eBay, there are quite a few listings. The bigger ones can be found searching for 'amber bottles'.  Most of these specific vials were acquired via Flaschenland, a German glassware warehouse, which also sells the blue ones I was using quite a while ago."
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,drugsuser,1 point,Sat Mar 7 17:29:25 2015 UTC,Best I could find on ebay. Look good to you? What size bottles do you use btw?  I could order from Flaschenland but the postage is too much for it to be worth it. €9.90.
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,HWHank,1 point,Sat Mar 7 21:49:16 2015 UTC,"Those bottles look neat! They're fairly big though; you can fit in 1g/mL on average. The smaller ones in my picture are 5mL. The two big ones are 100mL each and are primarily used for PG solutions. The methaqualone in the center is stored in a 30mL pill bottle, and is the only synthetic substance so far I couldn't fit 5g of in a 5mL vial."
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,ColbyTheGamer,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"I see. I'll consider the 5ml bottles for loose powder. I was thinking of getting some 5-MeO-MiPT though and volumetrically dosing which is where 10ml bottles could come in handy. 10mg/ml seems to be a common dose for that. Just trying to work out how to mix/dissolve it. In Borax's guide he recommends putting the water and substance in the bottle and heating it with a closed lid. I was trying to consider alternatives. Using hot water rather than cold water with Borax's guide should eliminate the need to heat it, I'd think. Putting the bottle in a saucepan full of water, like a bain marie. Also still debating how much I'll dissolve - obviously needs to be enough for the scales to be accurate but I'm considering a couple of concentrations and dosing powder, though the latter seems like a bad idea."
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,ColbyTheGamer,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:37:36 2015 UTC,"I think dissolving 5-MeO-MiPT is a good idea, although I am currently keeping it undissolved and have (with all risks involved) dosed it directly before. If you have the means to dissolve it, please do! It's both safer and easier.  10mg/mL is a fairly high concentration; I'd use nothing but a 1mL syringe/pipette for dosing that (which can only at most contain a single heavy dose). Perhaps 5mg/mL with a 2mL syringe/pipette is a little easier to work with.  If you have a milligram scale, I'd weigh off at least 100mg and work in 100mg increments from there until you either run out of substance or out of storage space for your final solution.  For making solutions, I usually keep the powder and solvent at room-temperature, and heat the bottle after mixing by drowning it in luke-warm to hot water. I think this is what you were implying, but I'm not sure how it's supposed to be different from what the manual you referred to suggests."

DrugStashes,2y8l0n,trancematik,4,Sat Mar 7 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"What is the methaqualone like, i have never been able to find it"
DrugStashes,2y8l0n,Oppositionaldefianc,10,Sat Mar 7 16:56:18 2015 UTC,"I have only taken methaqualone once so far; I administered ~525mg orally*. It's a euphoric sedative that could probably be described as something between most benzodiazepines and GHB in effects.  You end up with a mindset for which everything is very okay. Yet, as you're raving about this lack of worries, you're becoming increasingly hypnotized to the point you might just end up waking up in the morning realizing you just slept through $20 of a substance you might never be able to acquire again.  The one experience I've had was enjoyable, but it lacked stimuli. Without a social setting, you may not find it sufficiently engaging. I will have to experiment with different doses and settings to compose a proper opinion.  All together, I'd say it's only worth paying for as a novelty substance. Methaqualone is more than decent and certainly not overrated, but it has an unjustifiably poor cost-performance ratio.   * 525mg is a rather high dose for methaqualone. As sources are extremely scarce, it is impossible to establish a normal dose. If you ever manage to get your hands on it, please use care finding out the dose for your specific batch. Do not take more than 300mg if you are clueless about the quality of the batch; the famous hotel scene in The Wolf of Wall Street is not fun to end up in!"

DrugStashes,2y7euu,AtlasChristmas,2,Sun Mar 22 06:59:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a friend, let's call him Rob. Rob was an amazing student; always punctual, and had great grades. But everyday he was extremely tired, so he started taking Addy. As his tolerance built, he could afford it less and less. He then became addicted to it from taking it so often. Eventually, he ran out of money, couldn't keep up with bills, and had to drop out of college. He is now the outcast of his family and has attempted suicide a couple of times because he realizes how badly fucked up. Don't get me wrong, I love Addy. I take that shit all the time and it has definitely helped me improve in school, but you have to have self control."

DrugStashes,2y7euu,GotStomped,3,Mon Mar 23 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"Scramble refers to a more cut, powdery heroin, that's generally cut with stuff like benadryl to make it a better high for shooting. It's cheaper than raw generally.  Dealers in Baltimore have so much dope that you get a choice between raw or scramble for your dope."
DrugStashes,2y7euu,injectlsd,2,Mon Mar 23 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Cut Heroin.  Raw refers to 'pure' heroin and scramble refers to some dope which has been mixed up.  Some dealers on the east coast, like in Baltimore, will use regular ol' morphine as a cut in their scramble.  This is so their scramble is slightly better than others."

I currently use it to stay off IV opiates, and it's working fantastically for me. All I'm going to say is this: if you're not an opiate addict, use kratom responsibly and for the sake of those of us who need it to stay off hard drugs, don't advertise it to your non opiate user friends.  I know that seems excessive, but I'm super paranoid that Kratom will get scheduled any day now, and that would really ruin me. I really depend on the stuff. It's the only thing that's successfully kept me from shooting opiates.   Green strains for energy, red strains for sedation. I usually stay away from white ones; I've never been impressed.

DrugStashes,2wofbv,Illuzzi0nz,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, apparently this is definitely not NBOMe, since it's tasteless and not tinted pink l. Since it's tasteless It's either LSD, LSZ, AL-LAD, or 1P-LSD. I just thought it would be NBOMe since I had 25c with the exact same blotter art. It has to be either a lysergimide  or blank blotter. Ifit was tasteless and you tripped off it, Twas Definitley a lysergimide."
DrugStashes,2wofbv,JordanHF,10,Fri Feb 27 06:10:55 2015 UTC,I just thought it would be NBOMe since I had 25c with the exact same blotter art.   Blotter art has 0% indication of what is on it.
DrugStashes,2wofbv,Aminull,2,Fri Feb 27 09:50:12 2015 UTC,"You sound like you're trying to sound like you know what you're talking about.   Not all nbome sheets have running ink.   Just because it's tasteless doesn't mean it was a lysergimide and making that assumption could be dangerous. Taste is a horrible indicator, blotter art even more so."
DrugStashes,2wofbv,throwahooawayyfoe,2,Fri Mar 20 06:22:20 2015 UTC,"Name one tasteless psychedelic that is active in micrograms and not a lysergamide.  Also, what is the relevance of the ""running ink"" in NBOMe blotters..? NBOMEs taste the same whether they're liquid, blotters, powder, etc. The pink on the back is the NBOMe itself, not the ink.   I don't have to ""try"" to sound like I know what I'm talking about when I actually know exactly what I'm talking about."
DrugStashes,2wofbv,Aminull,1 point,Fri Mar 20 10:08:44 2015 UTC,"The pink on the back is the NBOMe itself, not the ink.   Not true. I've had sheets of verified NBOMe that had no bleedthrough and verified LSD that did have bleedthrough on the back. All it means is that the blotter page was well saturated with liquid when it was being laid and some of the ink on the front bled through to the back.  Sheets that have red colors on them tend to bleed more than sheets that don't have red. In fact, I've got some L right now on the 1960s Beatles blotter print from Key-Z that has bleedthrough on the back that corresponds with every place there is red ink on the front of the sheet. It almost looks like a negative image of what's on the front.  Except for 2C-C-NBOMe (which is generally a tan-ish color) and 25i-NBOMe (usually has a little bit of a yellow tinge to it), NBOMes tend to be a white crystalline powder in their raw form and at no time do they ever turn red or pink. The only psychedelic I can think of off the top of my head that's ever a pink color in its raw form is 4BDF (4-Bromo-DragonFLY), and that's believed to be caused by an impurity."
DrugStashes,2wofbv,throwahooawayyfoe,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"Funny that I've never seen that Beatles blotter with anything but nBOMEs. How's it taste?

DrugStashes,2w93g0,thermes12,3,Wed Feb 18 01:35:19 2015 UTC,well the halflife of bupe.(suboxine) is much longer than that of other fast acting opiates like oxy. So the withdrawl is much longer and more agonizing mentataly. With oxy withdrawls its hell for a few days and then is over.  So basicley the withdrawl is longer like about a week. Ive always pussied out and used again.
DrugStashes,2w93g0,sopedick,3,Wed Feb 18 03:52:50 2015 UTC,Can confirm. And it's not a week... try a month. Pretty much just as bad as methadone to quit.

Now I've never tried the parent compound but I can say that this is a very nice benzo, very hypnotic and quite recreational.  Diclazepam is a Valium (Diazepam) analogue. I haven't actually tried it yet but it supposedly has 10x the potency of the parent compound. It undergoes metabolism to Lorazepam, Delorazepam, and Lormetazepam which is quite different to Diazepam metabolism."

DrugStashes,2vg8tt,InfiniteThought,18,Tue Feb 10 19:56:32 2015 UTC,Looks like an old person's heart medication.
DrugStashes,2vg8tt,CrunkJesus,11,Tue Feb 10 22:49:27 2015 UTC,Looks like nitroglycerin. Nitro requires a low light condition because it will deteriorate the medicine so it requires a container like that or the typical brown glass jar some medicines require. Nitro is a very small pill and looks to be about the correct size given the finger for scale. If taken it will lower your blood pressure due to the vasodilation effects. Do not take it.
DrugStashes,2vg8tt,NotATechGuy,9,Tue Feb 10 23:29:26 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it's so small my phone was not able to get a picture of the N stamped on the front and the lightning like imprint on the back. The back kind of looks like this thing ~ but upright
DrugStashes,2vg8tt,krixo,28,Tue Feb 10 19:59:39 2015 UTC,"My uncle carries a nitroglycerin pill(hence the N) around his neck in a similar container. He has a bad heart, and nitroglycerin can help prevent heart failure, if administered rapidly."
DrugStashes,2vg8tt,crazymongrel,14,Tue Feb 10 21:16:36 2015 UTC,My father used to do the exact same thing. OP I would say it's nitroglycerin with pretty high confidence. My dad's little pills were also very brittle like what OP said.  Butttttt that container is pretty dope. You could put other stuff in it lol
DrugStashes,2vg8tt,NotATechGuy,3,Wed Feb 11 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"Nitro is mostly used for angina. It helps get rid of the pain because nitro is a vasodilator. Usually given during the onset of pain and/or a heart attack. Some take it daily, some take it PRN."

DrugStashes,2vg8tt,mdmainquiry,3,Tue Feb 10 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"It's definitely Nitroglycerin in a container like that, and what you see as a lightning imprint is likely a worn number ""4"", which is how they show the dosage on Nitroglycerin pills, it'll be 0.4mg.  Nitroglycerin tends to drop blood pressure, so people are encouraged to lie down after taking it for their heart condition, it'll probably give you a headache, make you dizzy and might make the next piss you take a little painful.   Mostly, it's taken by someone with angina sublingually (under the tongue) when they're experiencing severe chest/heart pain. It's fairly dangerous to people with no issues."

DrugStashes,2v7ud6,neveroddoreven-,7,Sun Feb 8 19:50:15 2015 UTC,Are you familiar with the concept of firecrackers? It's basically baby's first edible. Low effort low cost and low smell. You put peanut butter or some nutella(preferably mixed with some oil or butter(non weed oil or butter)) on graham crackers. On this you sprinkle some weed. Wrap em in tin foil and put them in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit or 170 celsius for ~20 minutes.   Well I've done this except I used used a bowl instead of a cracker to hold the nutella. It still tastes like shit imo but way better than having to eat a cracker with that shit. I threw some in a bowl with some ice earlier today and let it smelt. It was pretty good actually.

Research their effects on the brain and what not. I'm really not the the most educated in this category, and I stay away from most RCs. I know 2c-b is no longer classified as an RC because it's been around for so long and no adverse effects have been directly attributed to it. RCs are RCs because we don't know enough about them to know which are safe for human consumption, and which aren't.

DrugStashes,2svuwj,Ilovehugs119,10,Mon Jan 19 00:57:18 2015 UTC,How does the meth pipe work out for you for smoking DMT?
DrugStashes,2svuwj,Try_DMT,9,Mon Jan 19 02:17:00 2015 UTC,"besides making a [DMT] Machine, it is really one of the only ways to efficiently vaporize N,N-DMT -- unless of course you don't mind wasting a whole lot of it. also, its definitely not something I'd consider to be enjoyable and ""easy"" for people who don't have previous experience using a Bubble. It can be kind of tricky to master the technique of vaporizing crystalline substances out of a Bubble at first, but honestly its best to make a DMT machine out of a bong and a bubble and vape it that way. It makes the experience a lot more enjoyable and intense, which I assume is what a lot of people are looking for when it comes to N,N-DMT."
DrugStashes,2svuwj,unalert,3,Mon Jan 19 03:25:18 2015 UTC,How do you hit a bubble? Do you heat the glass from the bottom?
DrugStashes,2svuwj,unalert,12,Mon Jan 19 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"Load the N,N-DMT (or meth) into the Bubble via the small hole in the top, not the mouth piece or else some could get stuck/resinate hafway through the mouthpiece which can be irritating to try and get out. start by igniting Bic lighter flame (don't use a torch/crack lighter/anything other than a Bic) underneath the Bubble - but try and do this so there is a small amount of distance from the tip of the flame to the bottom of the bubble, where the N,N-DMT (or meth) is located. when you see the drugs inside the base of the Bubble begin to evaporate, you may choose to begin inhaling by holding the mouthpiece of the Bubble somewhat in between where your teeth are located inside your mouth - this way you tend to inhale all of the vapor. However, some people don't inhale the first hit, and instead use it as a chance to slowly twist the Bubble to the left and the right so the evaporated drugs (which have now become a liquid) is dripping all around the bottom of the Bubble's base.  Once the liquified, evaporated drugs have dripped all throughout the bottom of the Bubble you may rub the Bubble on your pant leg or touch it on a wet wash cloth -- this causes the crystalline drug inside the Bubble to immediately recrystallize all over the area it has smeared. This allows you to hit the Bubble more efficiently, also makes the hits taste a lot less shitty. Technically N,N-DMT will always taste shitty, though. It also allows for larger hits, but without a DMT Machine (which involves a bong of a decent size) your hits will never be considered ""monster"" hits. DO NOT under any circumstances hold the flame directly against the base of the bubble or allow it to get too close to the bubble no matter what you hear or who you see doing it, it really just torches the drugs and causes a massive waste of money and blackens the bottom of the bubble. which can be annoying to clean at times, also keep in mind the bubble can get too hot and shatter or crack. with a bubble you generally dont want to hit it too many times in rapid succession because of the above potential risks, so you want to make sure you get a few decent sized hits back to back also because n,n-dmt doesn't last very long and the goal is to absorb as much as you can before it starts to wear off at all or the experience wont technically be very enjoyable. IME unless you managed to acquire the pure, flaky white crystalline kind of n,n-dmt you will need to vape it out of a DMT machine in order to get the kind of intense experience I am talking about, which by the way still involves a bubble so these instructions are useful regardless of which way you are vaping it. another thing you should worry about is the bubble becoming too hot, I know I just said that but I forgot to mention that it also makes the hits very hot and it can burn the fuck out of your mouth and throat rather easily. that combined with the bad taste and the general instantaneous psychedelic effects produced by the n,n-dmt you are vaping can be quite uncomfortable. the hotness of the hits after a few times can also prevent you from being able to absorb enough to be ""good off"", which is why a DMT machine is almost necessary for most users. As a bong tends to cool down the hits a great deal, as well as hold most of the vapor within the piece itself allowing you to not lose as much with each hit and also take much larger hits. I know it sounds like I am trying to give you a sales pitch on a DMT machine but it really truly is a 10 times greater experience than just using a bubble. Some people are so foolish they even try to smoke it on a bowl of weed... massive waste of deemsters. :/ anyways I hope I helped, don't forget to hold the vapor in for 3-4 seconds after inhaling, some people say it doesnt matter how long you hold it in because its vapor and once its absorbed by your lungs all of the drugs you can possibly absorb due to bioavailability have been absorbed and what you exhale isnt, in fact, wasted drugs. but IME holding the hit in for ~3ish seconds has produced decent results. good luck!"
DrugStashes,2svuwj,unalert,4,Mon Jan 19 05:34:47 2015 UTC,You are spot on! Thank you for saving me the trouble of the essay you just wrote. Someone should link this in r/dmt dmt sidebar so the info is easily available to individuals that are new to freebasing.   Anyway. The thing I have found worked best for me and gave me the most intense putter body experience was using and iolite butane vaporizer. This was loaded with 80mg into the metal bowl then 4 breaths of the vaporized dmt held in my lungs till I was unable to see anything in my field of vision. I turned off the vape before blasting off.. This is my favorite experience to date after trying every kind of roa. Including iv.
DrugStashes,2svuwj,v00dude,2,Mon Jan 19 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"I was unaware you could IV n,n-dmt... it sounds insanely hard, too. :/ but yeah feel free to save the tutorial I wrote down somewhere!"

DrugStashes,2qyyur,SgtFaecesProcessor,2,Thu Jan 1 08:26:48 2015 UTC,honestly diazepam is one of my favorites for sure. I also love bromazepam and temazepam. Everyone's preferences are different though.
DrugStashes,2qyyur,ddm0079,3,Thu Jan 1 18:31:35 2015 UTC,I'm a lil bit of a noob. What feelings does diazepam give you and whats a good starting dosage?
DrugStashes,2qyyur,anewReality,1 point,Sun Jan 4 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"A good dose is 5-10mgs. Diazepam is great because it's not overwhelming but definitely sedating. For me, it has one of the best feelings but klonopin is definitely my fav. Good strength and feel. Alprazolam is intense, kind of nauseating and makes me feel anxious afterwards. In a nutshell, benzos are nothing to fuck with and certainly can cause much more anxiety than they help."
DrugStashes,2qyyur,SgtFaecesProcessor,1 point,Thu Jan 29 20:48:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, if I do try others I just don't want to overwhelm myself with choice. Not that they're easy to get anyway. I was looking at bromazepam, lorazepam and maybe midazolam from your collection in the picture."

DrugStashes,2qeala,woodenpipe,1 point,Thu Dec 25 23:14:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the trade names are a little different on some of them.  While I was at the pharmacia, I googled the names to be sure I knew what I was getting.  When I went back the 2nd time to pick up the xanax and klonopin, the pharmacist asked me if I was still having back pain and if the tramadol was working.  I said it was so-so, but I was fine with it.  She then pulled out a bottle of 100 oxycodone oxycontin 30 mg pills and asked if I was interested.  I almost shit myself that she just went and offered it up to me like that.  I passed on it tho (but now wish I would have just gotten a box of 14 or so to try it out...)   Edit:  major difference!"

Edit:  I think the Tramadol was a mistake.  It does nothing for me -- at least at 200 mg.  It just mellows me out, but I'm afraid to take too much more due to what I read on risk of seizures.  I have a pretty high tolerance to hydrocodone and enjoy that category of pharms, but I haven't ventured to oxys (althought I now wish I had picked some up).  Otherwise, I like stims too, but couldn't find anything but Ritalin RT (which I like so-so, but do like Vyvanse better).  Haven't tried Adderall, but couldn't find that or Vyvanse down in Mexico (at least at the farmacias I stopped at).    I'm about to flush the Tramadols down the toilet since they are a waste of my time unless someone has a good suggestion on how to take them and get ""something"" from it...

DrugStashes,2pbmt1,budjuana,3,Mon Dec 15 14:00:19 2014 UTC,i find it to have some extra deschloro-ness to it.  but seriously i would also like an answer.
DrugStashes,2pbmt1,ReamTeam513,0,Wed Dec 17 11:12:52 2014 UTC,"To me, it's a bit slower acting and less hypnotic.   While it doesn't make you as sleepy, it isn't as mood-lifting as etizolam. It's decent for sleep or just relaxing."
DrugStashes,2pbmt1,ReamTeam513,2,Sat Dec 20 07:55:40 2014 UTC,"I'm sure it's already out there, but would you mind telling me what the ethylphenidate is like? I'm currently prescribed dexmethylphenidate and am curious because it's one of the only stims I've enjoyed so far."
DrugStashes,2pbmt1,fuuuuckckckckck,2,Mon Dec 29 17:15:41 2014 UTC,"It's pretty enjoyable. Some people call it ""diet coke"" because it is smooth, non-jittery, and pretty euphoric.   Only downside is that the chemical itself is pretty caustic, meaning you won't want to snort it or put it under your tongue. (It'll hurt like hell, trust me, I was warned but I still tried)  So then your choices are pretty much taking it orally or plugging it.   Personally, I plug it because it has the highest bio-availability rectally. Dissolve .3 - .4 mg in 10 ml of water in an oral syringe, pop it up there, push the plunger. Then you wait three-five minutes and you'll be feeling pretty good :)  I know plugging isn't for everyone, but once you get over the stigma of putting it ""up there"" you'll never go back to consuming orally"

DrugStashes,2ozfn4,Dirty_D93,2,Sat Jan 3 16:10:23 2015 UTC,"Kind of difficult to explain, I've seen someone call DXM the ugly sister of MXE. I've never done DXM so I can't really compare.   At a decent dose MXE pretty much washes away all worries of anything and you just exist, like being wrapped up in a fuzzy blanket and floating through space.   Lay back, listen to music and let your mind wander.   If you enjoy DXM I imagine you will outright love MXE."

DrugStashes,2ozfn4,beastlymoo13,1 point,Thu Dec 11 18:34:59 2014 UTC,"Definitely be careful. It can be quite addicting.  When you first start, there are literally no side effects. Low does are fun to chill & watch a movie or play a video game (you feel like you're in them). Higher doses, you can get more fucked up than a night of drinking and wake up with no hangover. Often in the beginning I'd even feel more positive and motivated the next morning.  Id set limits in the beginning (once a week) but I eventually would find myself thinking ""Yeah, but why not just like a little bit tonight. Can't think of a reason not to."" Eventually that led to every night. I almost thought I was better because I'd cut down on smoking weed & drinking a lot. I just kinda swept my mxe use under the rug.   It really fucked me up for a while. I was less present in everyday life, became less motivated, ridiculously lazy, anxious. I was in school and I barely passed 2 semesters (adderall saved me finals week). I realized I should cut back, that I'd just hang onto it for certain occasions, ""no sense throwing it away."" Couldn't stay away though.  Eventually one night, after about a year of regular use, I decided it really needed to stop. I was really fucked up on it, but decided to throw all of it away. There was such a huge weight lifted off of my shoulders. My general mood and well-being improved. It's been a bit over a year since then and it's clear I'm in a very different place than I was before I quit. I do still enjoy ketamine on occasions, but I don't know anyone who sells it, so I only ever get it at festivals."
DrugStashes,2ozfn4,expanding_mind,1 point,Thu Dec 11 18:58:52 2014 UTC,Wow dude damn. Thanks for the input. Sounds like exactly what I'd do (use for a year and decide one day to quite)
DrugStashes,2ozfn4,Try_DMT,2,Thu Dec 11 20:18:41 2014 UTC,I've never even heard of most of this. Can anyone share some knowledge?
DrugStashes,2ozfn4,Try_DMT,4,Fri Dec 12 16:18:20 2014 UTC,5-MAPB is a Euphoric stimulant similar to MDMA. You can combine it with the 4-HO-MET and 2-FA (another stimulant) to replicate the MDMA experience nearly exactly (with less neurotoxicity to boot)  MXE is a dissociative similar to Ketamine.   4-HO-MET is a psychedelic similar to shrooms (theorized to metabolize the same way as psilocin) but with a more lighthearted silly headspace. It's just plain fun honestly.   Edit - cleared up some stuff
DrugStashes,2ozfn4,obsidianchao,2,Fri Dec 12 16:40:15 2014 UTC,"How do you like 5-MAPB, I've been meaning to look into the APB series. A MDMA-esque compound without the stim effects and post-roll blues sounds amazing."
DrugStashes,2ozfn4,mdmawesome1,2,Thu Dec 11 19:58:49 2014 UTC,"I've only done it once so far and it was a blast. 80mg of 5-MAPB + 10mg of 4-HO-MET is awesome and you're not super stimulated.   Listen to some awesome music and chat with a friend.  The comedown was clean and chill, had a nice afterglow a few days afterwards."

That said, MXE is about the exact same, but INTENSE.  You're guaranteed to hole as long as you take about .08.  It's more dangerous, it will last multiple hours, and you may be in a hole for a similar time frame (or in and out of the hole).  When I did it at the beach it started out just the usual numb knees, giggly, confused and blissful.  3 hours later still feeling it take line 2 and get ratchet.  everything is distorted and I am pretty much at the mental capacity of 2 seconds post Nitrous rip.  Climbing on stuff, mumbling words, ambient audiable distortions, the whole works.  2 hours later, line three.  I immediately panic and go lay back in the drivers seat of my car.  I close my eyes and become totally convinced that I have just melted into the actual fabric of the universe, I see a line of bright lights across pitch black darkness.  I thought I was there for a very long time.  About an hour and half after that we went walking around cause we heard dubstep like there was a show around but ended up walking back and forth on the beach cause we couldn't figure out where it was."

DrugStashes,2ojl9n,evomade,2,Mon Dec 8 13:10:59 2014 UTC,How're your experiences with 2c-ip?
DrugStashes,2ojl9n,evomade,3,Sun Dec 7 15:18:02 2014 UTC,"bluelight says:  So I tested out 10mg of this... As psykap said, there is nothing very interesting here except maybe the lack of body load. I will not attempt a +3 (probably 15-20mg) with this. Anyway, 2c-ip ~1mg: No effect ~5mg: +1 for ~8hrs  10mg: ++ for ~10hrs (all oral doses on an empty stomach) For comparison, +3 doses of some 2c's for me: 2c-i 15mg, 2c-e 10mg, 2c-t2 15mg, 2c-d 15-20mg  Onset - 3hrs Peak - t + 4hrs Plateau - 10hrs Comedown - 3+hrs Total Duration - 16+hrs  BP, HR at rest - 120/80, 85 At peak - 147/80, 99. Surprisingly minimal change. During comedown - 127/85, 83  Mild music enhancement, sexual enhancement during peak. Mild, pleasant body load during onset and at peak! Not sure if this was because of my low dose or if it is a property of this drug. Minimal visuals, nothing unique in their quality or content. Mood is stable; positive but not euphoric. Possible nausea issues - took 4mg Ondansetron 1hr in but it wore off before the comedown. Bloating and gastric distress like 2c-e despite the Zofran. No nootropic potential. Except for typical psychedelic though loops, I feel stupid on it like on most 2c's.  Basically this drug lasts way too long with nothing interesting during the peak (@10mg) and has minimal if any nootropic or therapeutic effects."

DrugStashes,2ohc5x,warpig921,1 point,Sat Dec 6 23:22:39 2014 UTC,tramadol is nice i dont know why u cant cum on it tho i can but i just find that tramadol on its own is quit ordinarie body high is nice after you take a 300ml dose but im used to stronger opiates so yeah
DrugStashes,2ohc5x,ndestinym,1 point,Fri Dec 12 10:40:46 2014 UTC,"Tramadol can be nice, it's very mild but it'll get you relaxed and if you don't have a high tolerance possibly even a nice buzz. Don't take too much at once though.. Exceeding 3-400 mg can lead to serotonin shock and you'll be in trouble."
DrugStashes,2ohc5x,ILoveRx,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"So tell me about Tramadol.  I just acquired 100 pills of 100 mg of Tramadol...and so far it hasn't done much for me other than a general mellow feeling.  I took 2 pills (200 mg total) on a couple of occasions with perhaps one alcoholic drink in my system.    I'm unfamiliar with that particular med, so I don't want to overdo it.    Recommendations on how to use Tramadol for rec use?"
DrugStashes,2ohc5x,aColdBowlofFuck,2,Wed Dec 31 05:38:03 2014 UTC,"There are quite a few people that don't get any noticeable recreational effect from it, myself included. It will drop your seizure threshold after about 300mg, so be careful. Honestly, I think I'll stick with kratom."
DrugStashes,2ohc5x,ILoveRx,1 point,Thu Jan 1 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"So these things basically don't have any rec value or does it depend on an individual's bio-chemistry?  I thought Tramadol was a opioid kinda like hydrocodone or oxycodone, but I'm now finding it's not actually a narcotic opioid but rather a synthetic.    I'm bummed out I bought a bunch of these not realizing what they were.  My purpose was to eat them for rec value, but they don't do anything for me really other than subdue basic pain and give me a slight mellow feeling.     Any thoughts on what to do with these things?  I have about 95 pills left..."
DrugStashes,2ohc5x,aColdBowlofFuck,2,Thu Jan 1 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"I've read in drug forums that you can increase saturation by taking half your dose and waiting a half hour or so before taking the other half. Take that with as many pinches of salt as you'd like.    The only value they ever had for me was to take away opiate withdrawls. The side effects and dangers weren't really worth it to me, so, like I said before, I think I'll stick with kratom.     Any thoughts on what to do with these things? I have about 95 pills left...     I dunno, some people do like them ..."

DrugStashes,2nqfxv,ReamTeam513,2,Sun Nov 30 00:04:01 2014 UTC,How are the Valium working for you?
DrugStashes,2nqfxv,ReamTeam513,3,Mon Dec 1 15:51:24 2014 UTC,"Not as well as I had hoped. The beginnning is a bit rough.  The Alprazolam equivalent to Diazepam is .5mg Alp to 10mg Diaz.   I currently take 3mg of Alprazolam a night to fall asleep. So...60mg of Diaz is equal to 3mg of Alp. So I am taking 6 of these fuckers each night...and it just mentally feels bad bc I am ingesting so many damn pills compared to my former 1.5 sticks.  One thing I have noticed...is I have been able to go 4 days in a row without taking any Benzos and supplementing with Phenibut...then on the 5th night I took an Ambien 12.5 CR and felt like a million bucks the next day.  I am very well aware of the risks that come with regular Phenibut dosing and the potentital it has to reak havok on my life. However, bc Phenibut (needs more research) is GABAb and Benzos are Gabaa...I am wondering if I can slowly just switch from Apl->Diaz->Phenibut->Ambien...then take it down from there.  I can't afford total rebound insomnia at this point in my career.  Note: The above is not researched medical knowledge, just basic research that I did on my own and is not recomended"
DrugStashes,2nqfxv,maalco,2,Tue Dec 2 19:13:20 2014 UTC,"It didn't work well for me. I was tapered off 2-4mg of Xanax daily with Valium and it was a truly terrible experience. I was given extremely low doses of Valium which didn't even put a dent in my accumulated tolerance from years of daily benzos.  You sound way more equipped with meds though so hopefully your taper will be successful! I've heard after two weeks it starts to get a little better, I just rode out two months of hell cold turkey.  Best of wishes to ya man, it's a loooong shitty process but you got it! Keep to your taper and if you slip up it's alright, this is a learning experience. Keep your head up!"

And to elaborate as to why I acquired so many at one time (I am not flipping them in case anyone was wondering):   I have managed to back myself into a corner with an Alprazolam chemical dependency over the past 18 months that I am fed up with...which has finally given me the motivation to call it quits.   As many of you may/or may not know, kicking Benzos is a nightmare that often makes kicking dope a breeze in comparison.  Not to mention, Benzo WD can be deadly if not administered properly.   I will be utilizing The [Ashton Manual]{http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm#11} as my guide.

I also have 5mg yellow tabs but I try to avoid snorting those often as they have twice as much filler/binder per mg.

DrugStashes,2lyzja,netnet1014,-9,Tue Nov 11 20:43:28 2014 UTC,"Also size is a big factor. If each tab is 0.5cmx0.5cm or around that then its highly likely that it's LSD, as the active level of LSD is much smaller than most RC chemicals like nbome. I think LSD becomes active around 50mg while other RCs are like 600mg+. Therefore most nbome and other RCs are closer to like 1.5cmx1.5cm I believe (don't quote me on this, I've never had a interest in any RC so the exact sizing might be a bit off.)  But just because the blotters are bigger doesn't rule it out either since you can put less on more. You just can't put more on less."
DrugStashes,2lyzja,DeathAndRebirth,4,Tue Nov 11 20:46:07 2014 UTC,"I had a 0.7x0.7cm blotter which I believe was NBOMe.

""I wouldn't have normally even mentioned it but saw he was already getting a test kit so figured it wouldn't hurt.""  I would have never told anyone to trust bloating sizing before dosing.

That shit is not to be trifled with.  Here's my trip-report on it: http://www.reddit.com/r/Nbome/comments/1wu2rx/25b_nbome_1300ug_25c_500ug_combo_trip_report/  I took less than 2.0mg, and had the worst/most intense trip of my life.

DrugStashes,2lugsv,TheChadicus,2,Tue Nov 11 01:51:45 2014 UTC,Can an active dose of 4aco fit on a blotter?
DrugStashes,2lugsv,patreezyy,2,Tue Nov 11 02:01:41 2014 UTC,"Assuming ""Active"" dose means full-blown 'trip'? Then, no; it most definitely can NOT. 25mg of 4-AcO-DMT was pretty mild, at least relative to decently strong blotters I've had before (such as 1.3mg of 25-B, 250ug of AL-LAD, 275ug of LSD, etc.). I would say 30mg+ would be around the same potency as like 1.0mg of 25-B.  30mg+ of 4-AcO-DMT will definitely NOT fit on a standard blotter. Hell, not even 5.0mg will (and that definitely isn't enough to cause a 'trip')."
DrugStashes,2lugsv,TheChadicus,-5,Thu Nov 13 11:04:15 2014 UTC,Depends on how much an active dose is to you.
DrugStashes,2lugsv,patreezyy,2,Tue Nov 11 02:28:57 2014 UTC,"15-20mg, MINIMUM. 1 blotter should always be enough to cause minor psychedelic effects/ a 'trip"". I'm sorry, but you can't even fit 1/3rd of a mild dose of 4-AcO-DMT onto a blotter. You would need to eat like 3+, to get any noteworthy effects from it, and by then, the likelihood of one of the 25-X NBOMes causing an overdose is very real.    Not to be a dick, but this is probably the most absurd blotter lay I've ever heard of. 2 extremely dangerous NBOMes and 1 RC tryptamine whose dosage is far too small to produce any noteworthy effects, in blotter form. There's a reason you don't see people selling 3-10 different RCs on one blotter... Because usually just 1 RC is somewhat f a gamble; it's fucking asinine to just take a smorgasbord of them at once..."

DrugStashes,2jvs70,bagofm3th,1 point,Mon Nov 24 17:52:12 2014 UTC,"Just to answer at least one of these ""those are methylone"" claims, and you being the latest.  Both methylone and MDMA can look very similar. Both can be pink, yellow, white, tan, etc, etc. It's almost definitely impossible to tell by a picture alone what it is. It could just be crystal sugar candy as they used in Breaking Bad to replicate Meth, for all we know.  So with that said I obviously admit that some of these could be Methylone or whatever else. Especially considering they are just images gathered on the net.  But I would still wager that most of the images are of MDMA, and of somewhat decent quality, considering the context they were gathered in. And regardless should it make your mouth dry up and your pupils dilate, because there are some seriously intoxicating amounts of class A drugs there."
DrugStashes,2jvs70,_herrmann_,2,Mon Nov 24 19:11:50 2014 UTC,"What's with the wide range of color / hue? Purity level? Dyed for effect? And what the hell do you do with this? Crush, cut, press into pills? Crush / snort? Or can you swallow these chunks.. Stumbled here on r/random. Interesting sub, totally clueless"
DrugStashes,2jvs70,_herrmann_,1 point,Tue Dec 2 00:19:06 2014 UTC,"Sorry late response. The variation in color is from impurities left over from the manufacturing process. There are different precursors you can use to make it, and some can leave behind a color/hue. Ideally should the crystals be clear and colorless, but that's apparently quite hard to achieve. Some color might also appear as a result of attempting to mask the product during transportation. (Smuggling in wine, or whatever.) The purity can still be very high, regardless of the colors.  Usually the crystals are crushed and ""bombed"" - i.e. packed in a gelatin capsule or just rolling paper, then taken orally. You can also snort it, for a bit faster onset, but somewhat shorter duration (and a sensational burning in the nostrils). Smoking, injecting, plugging (up the bum) and taking it sublingually is also possible. Pills can be made from this, but is usually done by the manufacturers, not the users.  If you're gonna go on an adventure, I'd recommend reading through something like RollSafe.org, to minimize any risk and making sure you'll have a good time."

DrugStashes,2jtyvt,Mortadelo__,7,Tue Oct 21 00:47:50 2014 UTC,"Oh, no problem at all!  I obviously haven't tried all of these yet, but.  6-APB is kind of like MDMA, but no real body high.  It's all mental, and very therapeutic.  The 5-APB was just a sample and I took all 130mg, but it wasn't quite enough.  The effects felt similar to 6-APB but a little more sedating.  My girlfriend took the Methylone.  She said her body is really buzzy and it's making her really talkative.  MXE is pretty well known, so you probably have an idea what that's like.  4-HO-MET I just took some, I can get back to you later on how that is.  The 3-MeO-PCP is actually for a friend, but I wish it wasn't, haha.  I really love it.  It makes your body really numb and you get dissociated, but your mind is racing with crazy ideas.  I really like writing on it.  I don't have any experience with the others yet."
DrugStashes,2jtyvt,viktorb,1 point,Tue Oct 21 01:08:30 2014 UTC,Yeah?  I heard they were similar.  I'd be interested to hear what you thought.
DrugStashes,2jtyvt,Mortadelo__,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:12:51 2014 UTC,Thanks for the info! I'll have I look into some of these.
DrugStashes,2jtyvt,rcrabb,1 point,Tue Oct 21 02:16:20 2014 UTC,"Okay, I have some experience with all of these now.  6-APB: 2g   Both myself and every person I know who has tried both prefer 6-APB to MDMA.  There's much less of a body high, and it's mostly mental.  It's slightly psychedelic, but not strongly.  It's good for conversation, working through problems with people, etc.  Pretty stimmy.  MXE: 2g  MXE is really popular, so you probably know about it.  It's similar to ketamine but lasts longer.  It's a great dissociative, and lately I've been finding it a lot of fun to dance on.  6-APDB: 1g   Feels like 6-APB but far more subtle and weak.  Doesn't last as long either.  I definitely wouldn't buy this again.  4-HO-MET: 250mg   this ended up being a really great psychedelic.  Tons of open eye visuals, synesthesia with music and just general euphoria.  It took me a really long time to come up on it though both times.  The one time took over three hours.  I ended up getting impatient and taking more and a lot of MXE and I really overshot my dose.  MXP: 500mg   I just took this one, so this will be the only one I will have to update later.  I dosed 150mg and waited an hour and a half.  I have very minor effects from it, but they started fading so I dose another 150mg or so.  I have a crazy high tolerance to DXM, and given how similar these are in effects I'm wondering if that's why?  But I also have heard there's just a cross tolerance between all dissociatives.  (For what it's worth, I pretty much have to take like 900mg minimum now of DXM.)  After redosing a half hour ago I'm starting to feel like I'm coming up more.  The effects are supposed to be very similar to DXM, which I love.  So I have high hopes for the rest of my night.  Methylone: 250mg   Very much like MDMA, but a little more mild.  The comedown was better than actual MDMA, but still way worse than 6-APB or something.  Like I said before, my girlfriend took it and she was just feeling really buzzy and talking about stuff with friends and working out issues.  5-APB: 130mg   Like a more sedating 6-APB.  6-APB definitely seems to win as far as x-APB/etc chemicals go.  I don't see much reason to bother with any others, but none of them are super like MDMA, more like MDA, so if you wanted that MDMA feel it'd probably be best to go with Methylone or something else.  Proscaline: 250mg   I thought this would be awesome, I was really excited to try it, but it was just very underwhelming.  I took about 50mg and there were very few visuals, it mostly just put me in a psychedelic headspace.  I was in a pleasant mood, but it just wasn't really worth it to me.  And from what I've read doses beyond 60mg just end up increasing physical side effects, so I didn't bother doing any more.  3-MeO-PCP: 100mg  3-MeO-PCP might be my favorite dissociative if it lasted longer.  I'm something of a poet, and I love writing on this stuff.  Body goes completely numb, you feel really dissociated, but your mind is racing with crazy ideas.  It's a great drug for art creation, imo.  Or to just chill out with with some friends.  i definitely recommend trying it.  That's all of them.  I have another package coming in the mail that has a few more things which I can post about once I receive them, I think the postal service lost them though so I may have to have them reshipped.  That package includes   2C-E 250mg 2C-P 40mg 4-FA 1g 5-MeO-DMT 250mg AB-FUBINACA 500mg  I only have experience with 5-MeO-DMT but it was a really life changing drug for me.  I felt fulfilled in a way I never have before after taking it for like a month."

Very recreational for me as long as I have a gap of at least 1 day inbetween. Tolerance builds quick but also goes quick.i  Personally I haven't tried Gabapentin but I've heard it's pretty similar.

Pregabalin is a lot like Neurontin (Gabapentin) and it's classed as an anticonvulsant. Officially used for certain types of pain and partial seizures."

DrugStashes,2isjl0,Incocknito_,3,Thu Oct 9 20:57:01 2014 UTC,Do you like the kava tincture?
DrugStashes,2isjl0,Incocknito_,3,Thu Oct 9 21:19:39 2014 UTC,I only really use it to add a kick to my whole root preparations. It will work by itself but you would have to use half or even a full bottle of it. The gaia capsules are good too if u fortify it with a kava tincture. I like alcohol extracted tinctures better and this was wasn't alcohol extracted. Bottom line is you gotta use the whole root for the full experience. The two best capsules though are gaia caps and herb pharms kava. I like herb pharms capsules bc they have powdered extract in them and u can open them and poor it into a drink. The gaia caps u can't open but they are still strong.
DrugStashes,2isjl0,Incocknito_,2,Thu Oct 9 21:48:55 2014 UTC,"I actually made my own tincture, I was wondering how they would compare. Have you tried taking it sublingually? In my opinion it works 5x better than drinking it"
DrugStashes,2isjl0,Incocknito_,2,Thu Oct 9 22:07:41 2014 UTC,"That's really cool, I've never tried it sublingually I will have to try that. It sounds really interesting. Did you just make a grain alcohol tincture? I always wondered what the best way is for extracting the kavalactones since they are mostly soluble in fat. Are they soluble in ethanol as well? Bc you wanna extract all the kavalactones and not just 1 or 2 bc they work together synergistically. But I believe you if you say that it works well."
DrugStashes,2isjl0,Ajpimpcycle,2,Thu Oct 9 22:26:20 2014 UTC,"I mostly use micronized kava powder bc there is no straining involved. The roots are pulverized into such a fine micronized powder that they will dissolve in water and milk/cream and then you drink it and swallow the particles of the root too, which maximizes how much kava gets into you as opposed to straining kava disposing of the root powder. Micronized is my favorite for this reason. I just put I'm a bottle with water and milk and shake it and drink. It saves me from the mess of making it the traditional way without loosing potency."
DrugStashes,2isjl0,glitch92,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:30:39 2014 UTC,"Let me know what you think of that method! I researched it a bit and found that for dry, ground herbs 80 proof alcohol works the best. Although there wasn't any scientific data to back it up or anything"
DrugStashes,2isjl0,glitch92,2,Thu Oct 9 22:33:12 2014 UTC,"Ok will do. Most kava tinctures are extracted using alcohol, which is fine but I think that adding some sort of fat to that as well like half and half would work better bc kavalactones are fat soluble not water soluble and are somewhat soluble in alcohol. I think you could make an even better extract using alcohol and a fatty substance like lecithin. Just my theory tho. Anyways,mi hope u enjoyed my stash thanks for commenting! Cheers!"
DrugStashes,2isjl0,JulesWinnfeild123,1 point,Thu Oct 9 22:46:44 2014 UTC,"Also, while alcohol does work best for many dried herbs, it's best to read about the pharmacology of the alkaloids ur trying to extract. Kava is unique in that it is fat soluble so that's why I was think and alcohol/fat extraction might work better. Thanks for all ur input bro."

DrugStashes,2f8p2p,flicknipplehard,11,Tue Sep 2 07:45:10 2014 UTC,"Couldn't figure out how to show everything, but my current inventory of scripted drugs has around:   3.5grams diazepam          (700x5mg pills) 1 gram of lorazepam        (400x2.5mg pills) 800mg alprazolam         (400x2mg bars) 84 grams pregabalin         (560x150mg caps) 4 grams dexamphetamine  (800x5mg pills) 4 grams tramadol             (100x50mg caps) 2 grams methylphenidate  (200x10mg pills)  75.6mg fentanyl             (18x4.2mg (25ug/hr patches)) 75mg buprenorphine        (15x5mg (5ug/hr patches))   I have 3 separate stashes for my illegal/OTC/nootropics+other; though my scripted stash is biggest.   My OTC stuff is mostly things like: dextromethorphan, dihydrocodeine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, doxylamine, cetirizine, rabeprazole, metoclopramide, antacids, caffeine..etc.. (most of this stuff I just use to potentiate various thing, eg: antihistamines are mainly for opiate potentiation, the antacids/other PH-effecting agents are for amphetamine potentiation)..  Other stuff: zolpidem, melatonin, 5-htp, tyrosine, magnesium, tryptophan, piracetam, choline, phenibut, aniracetam, kava, naproxen, celecoxib, poppers (amyl nitrite) and around 150 nangs (nitrous oxide).  Was gonna list my illegal stash but I'm bored of typing now (it's mostly MDxx/LSD/DMT/shrooms and various RC's)."

DrugStashes,2f8p2p,Man_Get_Lost,7,Wed Sep 3 11:41:48 2014 UTC,"The reason I like prescription drugs so much is mostly because where I live(Australia) the (illegal)drugs are hugely overpriced; whereas I can get my 90% of my scripts for $6/each on the PBS.  I'll changed my prescriptions around every now and then but for the most part I'll pick up the following every 20 days or so: 500mg diazpam, 500mg dextroamphetamines, 1gram tramadol, 8.4grams pregabalin, 12mg fentanyl and 52.5mg lorazepam; all of which are $6 ea except the lorazepam (recently had to switch my alpraz to loraz due to the former being changed to a higher schedule, so I'm considering changing this to a different benzo at some point)."

DrugStashes,2f8p2p,obsidianchao,5,Tue Sep 2 17:55:46 2014 UTC,Really?? Didn't think a GP could prescribe dex/xanax..
DrugStashes,2f8p2p,phenobobbiedoll,1 point,Tue Sep 2 22:09:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah I was going to elaborate but.. then I didn't.  So I've been to 2 psychiatrists before, for a total of 5 appointments; I didn't see the point in continuing to go after I'd gotten the script/s I wanted (+it's expensive).  I went to my first when I was just finishing high-school; though I'd previously gotten benzo scripts from a GP (I'm unsure if you can still get xanax from a GP since the schedule has increased since then).   As far as I recall the only new medication I got at that time was for gabapentin. A few years later (fairly recently) I got interested in ritalin and dexies to see how they'd help as study-aids etc. So I booked a local psych appointment, got ritalin the first appointment, concerta the 2nd and then swapped to dexies on the last one. Since then I've only been to free GPs."
DrugStashes,2f8p2p,PurpleLotus,1 point,Wed Sep 3 11:38:44 2014 UTC,"Ah okay, yeah, that makes sense. In my experience, GP's have been able to prescribe weaker benzos.. such as diazepam, but I don't think GP's are able to prescribe anything such as ritalin, or dexamp. Nice stash though, either way, haha."

DrugStashes,2f5d0h,myjem,1 point,Tue Sep 2 01:54:14 2014 UTC,"yea, they definitely are. i guess it's just the novelty of using a lil ripped piece of paper, since i've been doing it for almost a decade.   i've seen grinders with shovels before, but never really had an interest. my buddy had an extra and tossed me his a couple weeks ago...been using it ever since lol"

DrugStashes,2exsbv,roionsteroids,3,Fri Aug 29 18:30:53 2014 UTC,It is not a xanax analogue. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine. Etizolam is a thienodiazepine.

I do like my strong beers/ales. I rarely drink weaker than 7%. Mostly 7.5 to 8.5% beer with occasionally strongers. I miss the Netherlands/Belgium. Netherlands gets a bunch of strong Belgian beers. Dirt cheap [in the supermarkets] and delicious. Cool country.

DrugStashes,2ebvwi,eurodmnbuyer,1 point,Mon Aug 25 01:44:01 2014 UTC,"Tell me about it. I enjoy the entire line made by the rochefort brewery. 6 and 8s are both lovely. I'll have the 10 on occasion, its nice but not necessary, I guess. And pretty much all the best beers are quite expensive where I live compared to how much I've seen them for in the Netherlands and Belgium. I found chimay blue for a great price once but its not really my cup of tea and I haven't seen it since or I would have bought a couple of dozen and stocked up. If I ever see rocheforts at a reasonable price I'll probably clear the shop's entire stock.  Think I might have tried one or two porters but not many."

DrugStashes,2e4hvo,PurpleLotus,2,Thu Aug 21 08:27:40 2014 UTC,"Dat tolerance.... I've been off of them for almost a full week now but I would take 10mg before work to ""take the edge off"" and reduce anxiety, 20-40mg to ""get high"".   I may have gone through 400-450mg in a matter of 3 or 4 days last time I got high with etiz.... so if it was in liquid form I'd have had to have been taking sips of liquid, which is kind of nasty, or another factor might be that counting out 20+ drops onto your tongue or food/drink would require you to actually keep track of your dose as you dose and that would be less simple than drip drip drip"
DrugStashes,2e4hvo,bukowskifan,1 point,Thu Aug 21 10:55:02 2014 UTC,Well daymn son. What do you do now to handle the anxiety?
DrugStashes,2e4hvo,PurpleLotus,2,Thu Aug 21 11:12:16 2014 UTC,"Not much I can do, in drug court so just caffeine and nicotine, neither of which really help. I didn't really taper but definitely took the majority of the etiz the first two days so that kind of helped point it in the right direction.   The first night off I took a fuckton of valerian root. Now to get high (if I have the money) I get a little dope, if I feel like I'm starting to freak out but don't have a lot of money to spend I'll get a 40oz. If I have absolutely no money I make a tea out of the valerian capsules.   Thankfully my work has beer/margaritas/sangrias in the walk-in cooler so I can have a few drinks to help with the anxiety but that's about it. Thankfully the half-life of etizolam is pretty short so the WDs are short also"

DrugStashes,2dd1rb,Ajpimpcycle,2,Tue Aug 12 19:22:31 2014 UTC,"Others cook the fentanyl out and make an IV solution out of them, but that's too dangerous for me since fenta can put you asleep forever really easily.. so I just cut tiny pieces (around 1x2mm) out and put them under the tongue, similar to LSD. That way, it gets released at an acceptable speed, the dosage is much more controllable and you can take it out whenever it's getting 'too much'.  In case you were asking how they work for non-abusers - you put them on your skin, and they constantly release the specified dosage (eg. 100 mcg/hr) over a course of three days, similar to nicotine patches.  Sorry for your dreadful condition - here in Germany, more and more patients in constant pain get prescribed fentanyl patches, as they are really reliable and guarantee an even release of the drug, and IR pills of Morphine/Oxycodon for pain spikes.   Sadly, I do fear that if you have tried other strong opiates and not had an adequate analgetic reaction, fentanyl won't necessarily do the trick either - but try hitting up your physician about it! Good Luck!"

DrugStashes,2ck9f6,coffins,3,Mon Aug 4 05:17:01 2014 UTC,"Lol, why would you recreationally do Seroquel? I've been on it for 6 years now for mental health reasons and the withdrawal from it nearly killed me. I'm still currently on 75 mgs (the most I was ever on was 600). Those are 2 25 mg tablets anyway, it's not really even enough to knock you out. What's the point of taking it, it just makes you drowsy.  Also, please be careful with Ativan. Benzos in general are extremely addictive and the withdrawal from them is worse than Seroquel.  Good luck."

DrugStashes,2cfpdz,fommerjackson,9,Sat Aug 2 18:43:33 2014 UTC,NBOME and LSD are never used interchangeably; only by highly ignorant people who think anything on blotter is acid. They have a few similar effects but aren't even in the same family. Methylone is Molly.   Opiates and opioids affect the body in nearly the same exact way. It's common for people to use the terms for each other.

DrugStashes,2aysf2,Dirty_D93,4,Thu Jul 17 17:11:06 2014 UTC,I feel like it should be a rule in the sidebar to add a description. I know many pills and substances are easily identifiable by many but it would really help the community out to see everything properly identified and labeled.   I only say this because I assume many people get a lot of their information about drugs on Reddit and similar outlets. These people would benefit from learning correct nomenclature and the rest of us would just be glad to confirm the substances without straining our eyes.

Prescribed Oxy IR, and just recently got my fent script taken away.   *The odd thing about the red jackets (chubbys) is the beads are often different sizes inside the same capsule. I only mention this because sometimes people will ""soak"" the beads and resale them. But with reds, it's just how they are. If you run into 12's that are different sizes I'd be leery, unless they were just broken down from a red into smaller capsules. (just a heads up for people new to the game)"

DrugStashes,2a2yuv,StaRkill3rZ,5,Tue Jul 8 01:18:46 2014 UTC,you mind sharing your TEK?  Nice stash!
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,StaRkill3rZ,7,Mon Jul 7 22:14:53 2014 UTC,"Sure!  I used a multi-spore syringe of P. Cubensis B+ to make 2.5 pints of LC.  I used local raw honey as the source of nutrients.  I then inoculated 8 quart jars of WBS with 25 ml of LC each.  I found a really good variety of bird feed called ""pigeon feed"" at my local feed store, it's made up of about 50% millet and the rest is corn and other good stuff.  Those jars took about 8 days to colonize.  I then used Damiend's 50/50 tek.  I used 4 quarts of spawn per brick of coco coir.  After the coir was pasteurized and cooled I mixed it with vermiculite and the spawn in 60 quart tubs that I had already prepared for fruiting but I covered the holes with duct tape.  I then put the tubs in black garbage bags since light can induce pinning with P. cubensis.  After a little less than 2 weeks I took the tubs out of the bags, took the duct tape off the holes and stuffed them with polyfil, then just let them do their thing.  Hoped that helped, i'd be more than glad to answer any specific questions you might have."
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,StaRkill3rZ,2,Tue Jul 8 01:26:53 2014 UTC,"thank you so much for your thorough response.  it has been several years since i have grown cubes, and was interested to see how much has changed.  i have been playing around with the idea of trying another run.  nothing more satisfying than growing your own brain candy."
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,StaRkill3rZ,2,Tue Jul 8 14:43:23 2014 UTC,No problem.  One thing I wasn't very thorough about is my sterilization processes but those are easy enough to find online.
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,DMThrowaway1,2,Tue Jul 8 16:43:50 2014 UTC,"too funny.  that is the one question i had from the beginning.  i always made a ""sterile chamber"" to inoculate in.  i would use a plastic bin with a lid and holes cut in the sides for my hands.  i would then attach rubber gloves to the holes to stick my hands through.  i would try and sterilize a small room (usually bathroom) and then do the deed in there.    is that still about the same process?"
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,DMThrowaway1,3,Tue Jul 8 17:07:05 2014 UTC,"Kind of.  I pressure cook my LC for 30 minutes at 15psi. The spawn gets soaked for 24 hours then simmered for 20 minutes then is rinsed and strained so there is no excess water.  The spawn is then put into jars and is PC'd for an hour at 15psi.  I pasteurize the coco coir and vermiculite in a bucket with boiling water.  All my injections are done in a room that has been still for over an hour and has been disinfected.  I don't use a glove box.  All my jars have silicone injection points I made.  Every time I start a new jar my syringe gets flame sterilized, and the needle is whipped down with Iso. alcohol between each injection.  Every time i'm transferring anything I wipe down everything with iso. alcohol.  Also, all my breathing holes in my spawn jars and tubs are filled with polyfil."
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,Cheebachewinski,2,Tue Jul 8 17:58:43 2014 UTC,"that sounds (more or less) like what i used to do.  the only part i did not do was the silicone injection points.  sounds like your process seems more sterile, so i might just have to borrow it.  thanks again for all the info!"
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,Ziu,2,Tue Jul 8 18:23:17 2014 UTC,1-2 months depending on what method/tek you use and if you run into any complications.
DrugStashes,2a2yuv,Ziu,2,Wed Aug 6 23:42:28 2014 UTC,Your first flush can be done as soon as one month.  Using a bulk tek you can get 2 good flushes and sometimes more after.

DrugStashes,29w9ah,littledecaf,2,Sun Jul 6 06:08:11 2014 UTC,"The 84% claims are based around either a poor understanding of the science or are a deliberate attempt to pass off inferior product as high quality.  You should read this discussion, but basically if anyone claims their MDMA is 84% pure then they have performed no analysis at all and should not be trusted.  With almost all, the name is an abbreviation for [Drug](salt). In the case of MDMA, it is MDMA.HCl, amphetamine is usually amphetamine.H2SO4 and LSD is LSD.tartrate.  Because these forms are ubiquitous, nobody bothers to mention the second bit because it's irrelevant. All doses you see for MDMA are referring to the HCl salt, which means that MDMA which is sold as ""the purest you can get, 84%"", is treated as 100% pure.  The reason sellers do this is because they usually don't have very pure MDMA, and they want people to make the mistake you have made and take more to account for crappy product. It is dishonest, confusing and misleading and if you have a choice you should avoid this vendor.  I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But then I realised that it made no difference, qualitatively. Placebo or not, I actually prefer the taste and effect of sandy coloured spice.  The yellow you see is because of absolutely minute trace amounts of plant tannins. Like maybe one percent. If you take into account that the basic aqueous layer starts off pitch black, this is pretty pure.  There's a lot of speculation floating around about NMT and N-Oxides, but it boils down to trace vegetable tannins. I never pull oil and maybe 10mg of wax on my final pulls.  30mg of what you see above = breakthrough for me.  I'd re-x if it came out piss yellow, orange or brown, but that's never happened to me. I'm not prepared to lose product for the sake of aesthetics and my tek yields 1.5% from MHRB of 100% effective DMT.  Light yellow DMT is all good peeps."

You know, when teks read something like ""To 1 liter of H20, add 100g NaHO. Dry 50ml of (CH3)2CO with anhydrous MgSO4""  And you have 5 STB teks on the Nexus. That's as many steps as there are in an STB extraction."

DrugStashes,26ygs5,UnderclassWEED,5,Sat May 31 15:05:56 2014 UTC,"I know. :P Just pointing out they're truffles, not shrooms. Shrooms aren't legal here, truffles are."

DrugStashes,26ygs5,Desecurls,1 point,Sat May 31 18:13:57 2014 UTC,We used a scale. But in the end it could also be because it was pretty damn dark in the room. Meaning the darkness got filled up with bright colors. I don't really know. Still good stuff though. Very strong shrooms.
DrugStashes,26ygs5,glitch92,5,Sat May 31 18:23:14 2014 UTC,.. where is this? I need this
DrugStashes,26ygs5,UffiziFirenze,2,Sat May 31 18:25:32 2014 UTC,Amsterdam probably.
DrugStashes,26ygs5,MyCoxAFloppin93,4,Sun Jun 1 02:38:59 2014 UTC,"150 km from Amsterdam but same country, Yeah."

DrugStashes,26ygs5,zagbag,2,Sun Jun 1 10:24:57 2014 UTC,"Ay, I took the largest dose of these that the head shop dude was selling, then took a wander to the Vondelpark in Amsterdam. Whilst the sun was setting, creating a soft orange glow on the lakes and in the trees, and a street musician played in the background, I decided that I was wandering through an Arabian pleasure garden.  Later, Me and my mate (on some slightly weaker shrooms) agreed that ""The definition of the honeymoon period is when your raison d'etre funnels down to spending more time with your significant other""  I took them at 4 in the afternoon, and at 2 in the morning, after a coffee, a fat J and a grilled cheese sandwhich, the walls still moved in the dark."
DrugStashes,26ygs5,GrindinAbortion,9,Sat Jun 7 12:32:28 2014 UTC,Nitrous on a shrooms is like a freaking DMT trip.
DrugStashes,26u6zt,SgtFaecesProcessor,4,Fri May 30 01:29:29 2014 UTC,I like your stash box.
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Rukoblue,5,Fri May 30 02:21:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks. Seemed appropriate - relatively sturdy, cheap, compact for my needs, quite nice on the eyes and hopefully easy to pass off in front of prying eyes. The only thing I don't put in it is the TEVA diazepam because the blisterpack is too beautiful for me to discard straight away.  Hopefully it'll become a little fuller in a few weeks. Hoping to be able to get some 2C-B, shrooms and some more benzos to try.  If anyone wants some closer pictures please feel free to ask, I didn't want to swamp people with photos too quickly."
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Rukoblue,1 point,Fri May 30 02:31:22 2014 UTC,I wouldn't mind closer pictures.  How much can you store in that thing?
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Rukoblue,3,Fri May 30 03:08:20 2014 UTC,"Of everything? Or anything in particular? The modafinil is certainly boring.  Enough is about as much as I can say. I don't smoke weed or snort powder so I keep largely only pills and paper/blotter in there currently and the only way that may change in the near future is shrooms probably. I just poured some vitamins in there which are a little bigger than the diazepam so probably 300 pills of that kinda size, which is much more than I thought. Not sure about ecstasy press size, as they're considerably bigger(150~200, if I had to guess). I am beginning to think it needs some padding in there though, the bag helps a bit but no one likes broken pills. The tin took a bit of hunting down tbh, not as widely available as I thought where I live but I found it after 3 or 4 shops, I think."
DrugStashes,26u6zt,KrakizBad,1 point,Fri May 30 03:26:48 2014 UTC,"The box itself with the drugs in it. I'm starting to build a collection, and I'm looking at my options when it comes to a nice, portable stash box. I was thinking my Halo 2 collector's edition, but then I wouldn't have anywhere to store my Halo 2 discs.  Out of curiosity, what's your reasoning behind not smoking weed?"
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Rukoblue,3,Fri May 30 03:34:40 2014 UTC,"Shit, I had a response written up. I'll try to include everything I did before I lost it. I tried it once and just as it was hitting me someone brought up something negative and ruined it for me. I'm going to Amsterdam soon though and a friend has offered to smoke some with me so I might do that in a week. Apart from that it seems like there is a much wider variety of ways to consume weed and therefore finding a starting point and preference is harder. Weed, hash, oils, wax, kief. Strains. Joint, pipe, bong, vaping. Edibles. And I only know the terms, I don't know much else than that. Plus, unless I'm mistaken it seems like a more expensive habit than LSD, MDMA and diazepam. I'm also hopeless at rolling.  I'll send you a PM with the pictures but if anyone else wants to see them they can just reply to this message."
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Tentex24,2,Fri May 30 04:03:40 2014 UTC,"You're way over thinking the pot thing. In Amsterdam just get some buds and use a bong or glass pipe. Hash is a sort of generic term that can refer to pressed kief (the crystals that fall of buds buds) or oil (chemically, usually butane, extracted THC). Hash is a lot more potent than buds and more difficult to smoke. As a non smoker hash oil would probably get you higher than you'd like to be."
DrugStashes,26u6zt,Tentex24,1 point,Fri May 30 13:19:15 2014 UTC,"My first few trips on weed were total bad trips (with the exception of my second time, when I hardly felt anything). I can't guarantee that it would work for you, but I just kept smoking until I had complete control over the trip. I feel as though it has helped me when I moved on to other substances, because I've been near bad trips many times, but I've always been able to fight them off.  Give weed a few more shots if you can. It's a nice drug for bringing you at a ++."
DrugStashes,26u6zt,BGoldringer,3,Fri May 30 15:43:15 2014 UTC,Dumb question but what are the wifi's and bit coins? Some sort of ecstasy?
DrugStashes,26u6zt,thewhiterabbit-,3,Fri May 30 04:26:56 2014 UTC,Yep. Made by a dutch ecstasy presser. The bitcoins are a predecessor of the wifis. 200-220mg MDMA in each pill so they're very strong. I start off with half to two thirds of a pill and redose a couple of hours later with part of the rest of the pill or the rest of the pill.

I think more was given away than taken. no fun alone and all that.   That was 2002 or so. OP's and DB in their heyday.  The most impressive result i had from anything on that paper was the siam bupe tabs. They were so tiny at .2mg,  and they were exquisite. Compared to the huge mg dosing in sub/naloxone combos, why such a small dose ? Whatever the reasons and mechanisms, 3 of those siam subs sublingually and you got some of the euphoria, but the social prowess was unparalleled."

DrugStashes,262lcu,friskydingo920,5,Tue May 20 22:58:24 2014 UTC,everything looks fresh cept that BHO. Id wanna toss that back into the ovenvac for a good while longer

DrugStashes,262lcu,PotionNumber25,2,Wed May 21 00:09:33 2014 UTC,I believe it was a pound in a pretty big ceramic dish

DrugStashes,262lcu,lanster100,1 point,Wed May 21 00:44:26 2014 UTC,"It was from the silk road, back before it got shut down and rebooted. It was easily the best roll I've ever had. Lasted for about 6-8 hours so I doubt it was methylone. It was little tan rocks, not really shards."
DrugStashes,262lcu,lanster100,2,Wed May 21 00:48:02 2014 UTC,My mdma seems to last 4 hours max
DrugStashes,262lcu,TOUCHYGOOSE,2,Wed May 21 04:39:25 2014 UTC,I'd say the main effects lasted about 4 hours. But I still felt really good and sitting around talking with friends was still very fluid for much longer
DrugStashes,262lcu,Narit,0,Wed May 21 04:41:52 2014 UTC,seriously?  how do people find rolling a simple joint so hard? why murder the entire weed by rolling it like that...

DrugStashes,25t67b,LumberJackFuckFest,11,Sat May 17 20:13:40 2014 UTC,"I found it always so, so hard to put that into words.. In my country, people say, roughly translated, that it wraps you in cotton. Your body goes numb, and euphoria takes over your soul, a feeling of all-encompassing happiness and satisfaction, making you talkative and taking away things that might gnaw at you, all the while leaving your head very clear (compared to e.g. cannabis).  Of course, I can only talk of my dosage and form of consumption - although I don't imagine it being too different (albeit stronger) when taken i.v. or boiled out.  If you're interested for an answer beyond my humble attempt at english language, you might want to read the collected 'field reports' over at Erowid, some of them are really worth the read!"
DrugStashes,25t67b,Ajpimpcycle,4,Sat May 17 21:01:00 2014 UTC,May want to look into -kratom- for that warm cotton feeling
DrugStashes,25t67b,SoberDreams,5,Sun May 18 01:27:51 2014 UTC,"I got a pack of 2g Kratom or so once when I was running out of 'real' stuff after many friends telling me it smoothened the withdrawal and was comparable to lower-potency opiates.. sadly, for me it did not work at all, so I had to stick to good old weed.  But if one has no possibilities to acquire opiates it should be given a try, I've heard many good things about Kratom!"

I figured if I was going to do that I might as well just upgrade which is what I did.  As for why I haven't thrown it away...no idea.  I'm not a hoarder, but I can't bring myself to throw certain things away.  Mainly techy things that are/were expensive.  I have an old dead iPhone that I have no charger for, for example."

DrugStashes,25kac2,Dumbface2,2,Thu May 15 02:56:03 2014 UTC,"I take cyclobenzaprine that looks like little houses, but I haven't tried more than two. Helps for pain/sleep, but what's the high like?"
DrugStashes,25kac2,glitch92,2,Thu May 15 15:37:20 2014 UTC,"Not op but I've used flexeril quite a bit. More than two and when it comes on you feel a real nice sensation of relaxation and comfort, and then an overpowering one, and then you fall asleep. We used to take four or five or more sometimes and see how long we could fight sleep and sometimes we fought it for a while but with more than two or three I've never been able to stay awake for too long. Which sucks honestly because I think it'd be a pretty nice high if only you weren't forced into sleep."
DrugStashes,25kac2,kirkkommander,4,Thu May 15 16:34:21 2014 UTC,I love the one upturned cigarette in the pack.   Nice stash.

Then you dont get cancer. my homies and i have been doing that for decades and ...no cancer  haha maybe its a cali thing..."
DrugStashes,25kac2,obsidianchao,4,Tue Jul 1 17:14:42 2014 UTC,Depends on person.  When I started meth 2g was enough for around a month. Now I can polish a g in a day.

I deleted my old account (think I've gone through 5-6 reddit accounts in the past year, bad habit of mine) but wow.  I don't think I could physically handle that much.  I do a lot to keep my tolerance down though."

DrugStashes,25hwkj,nightsticks,4,Wed May 14 11:56:58 2014 UTC,That and that fact that gum is as illegal as drugs by rave rules.

DrugStashes,25hwkj,TheLegion11,2,Mon May 19 20:01:33 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's a Canadian thing? Or even more localized than that. The 2 biggest reasons promoters typically don't allow gum are that they themselves want to profit off the sale of gum, or they just don't allow gum due to the cleanup."
DrugStashes,25fiai,friskydingo920,3,Tue May 13 06:51:06 2014 UTC,Do you prefer Etilaam or Etizest?

DrugStashes,25fiai,Foolish_ness,2,Tue May 13 07:37:22 2014 UTC,"Opinion on etizolam? Got someones home pressed (it's an RC in UK) and they were weaker than I was expecting; I've seen 1mg ~= 10mg diazepam as a rough guide. Not sure if it's my overestimation of etizolam or under dosed pills, but wouldn't call anywhere near that."
DrugStashes,25fiai,Foolish_ness,1 point,Sat May 17 20:43:04 2014 UTC,"I've had Diazepam, Alprazolam, and now Etizolam. I'd say Etizolam was equipotent to Alprazolam. I don't really wanna touch the stuff anymore. I usually make some sort of mistake I regret when I'm sober and my memories are way to hazy. I just think it makes me give too few fucks"
DrugStashes,25fiai,SilntNfrno,2,Sat May 17 20:46:01 2014 UTC,"Really? I'll be classing my experience with them as void then. Alprazolam is what I've just put in my mouth (it tastes, bad). So I'll be sure to remember for my next comparison, thanks!"
DrugStashes,25fiai,smoked-up,1 point,Sat May 17 20:52:57 2014 UTC,I've heard hearsay that the Ezitest pills are slightly more potent. But I don't see hoe 1mg of Etizolam could be more potent that 1mg of etizolam
