MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,-cutestofborg-,11,Tue Jul 21 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you so very much! My eyes have watered like crazy for years and it didn't matter if it said ""waterproof"" I would always end up losing the effect or smearing as the day wore on. Well the biggest help I found from avoid fall out and smearing was using MUFE Aqua line (I use the eyeshadow stick instead of the actual liner as I get more oz of material and they look and function the exact same) and their setting powder with spray work miracles together. I tested them by steaming my bathroom up and sitting in their for about 30 minutes in my full garb. I filled up my bathtub, and had the shower running at full hot. I basically created a steam room to test out the make movement. Yes, I bet it looked ridiculous, but worth it because I always want to present well when photographed :D   But nothing can really prepare you for a good ole fashioned Michigan heatwave :)"
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,everyone_loves_PINK,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:36 2015 UTC,I'm in Wisconsin. Saturday was absolutely disgusting. You look great and must really love what you do because there is no way I could have been out in that heat/humidity!!
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,eatgeeksleeprepeat,18,Tue Jul 21 18:37:14 2015 UTC,Awesome! You don't look shiny or sweaty at all :) Do you think the MUFE setting powder and spray made a big difference?
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,treesmoons,4,Tue Jul 21 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"The power made a HUGE difference around the face. The spray is light and works well, but no spray I've found can save you from that sweat you get on your face and that persistent sheen.   I used Urban Decay Setting spray for a couple of years with the MUFE power and didn't get these results, but when they worked in combinations, it was a hit!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,drdickweasel,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:07 2015 UTC,Wow! Great job on everything! You looked fab :) Those lashes with your mask = A+
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,xicana63,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I found that the application glue that came with Eylure couldn't hold up against the humidity, but the Kardashians glue (slight luminescence) worked wonders and I could sleep in my lashes with that glue! But didn't hurt to come off, great balance!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,VioletApple,4,Tue Jul 21 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"excellent staying power and all around look! have you experimented with other setting powders/sprays out there in those conditions? the MUFE looks to do a great job, but i'm always on the hunt for setting products!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2opx,VioletApple,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so very much :) I've used many many different combinations. I found what seems to work well for my skin tone and sweating. What works for me may not always be reliable with someone who may be more oily (I run a combination of dry to normal with a dash or hot flashes here and there).  I've always used MUFE powder, but I've tried the following sprays. I didn't use MUFE spray until recently because I tend to stagger my purchases and brand loyalty. Not intentionally, but I only change one or two things at a time to determine what works. At the time I was using the Urban Decay solo prior to adding the MUFE Powder.    Urban Decay Setting Spray with MUFE Power it caked on me or made me look dusty.  NYX Dewy Finish created a strange oily feeling on my skin, and created creases under my eyes. I may have been using too much.  Face-off from E.L.F. worked ok until I ran out of it and had to replenish, but could not find it again (and didn't want to drive another 40 minutes to the nearest supply) so I then grabbed MUFE at this point and the rest is history :)"

And I love that you used a sheer base and let your freckles shine through!  No CC from me, these are all really gorgeous and your technique is fabulous!"
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,sass_pea,2,Mon Jul 20 23:01:46 2015 UTC,I was really feeling that last look. I understand why 18 yr old me really liked it :) You can definitely recreate the 2nd look with the naked 3. You may have to throw in a warm toned matte brown but you should have everything else covered. I don't have that palette but I would imagine it to be easy to recreate

MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,wake--up,2,Mon Jul 20 23:56:13 2015 UTC,I like them. They are pigmented and I remember them lasting a while on the waterline. I got the Mint Julep and Turquoise ones because they are more unique colors
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,wake--up,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"ive been really interested in the mint julep because of how unique it is, i feel mint is a really uncommon color to find! im glad to hear its a good one, thanks for the info. it seems like oftentimes, pastel colors are hit and miss with pigmentation and texture."
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,sarahmcmast3r,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:44 2015 UTC,What brushes do you use for your eyeshadow? You are my eyemakeup idol haha
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,chefofathens,3,Tue Jul 21 00:13:09 2015 UTC,"I have generally been sticking to my Japanese brushes because they really make the job easy and are made really well. So, Hakuhodo, Chikuhodo, Koyudo, and Mizuho. I throw in some Mac brushes here and there as well :)"
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,Ralat,3,Tue Jul 21 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"Somehow I knew you would say this. I'm not quite ready to make the investment (I finally just got a MAC 217 which I can tell has improved my looks quite a bit) but I would love to know your favorites, because I suspect the day will be here soon!"
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,Lemimeee,10,Tue Jul 21 00:42:22 2015 UTC,"Pro tip, get good eye brushes from the J series from Hakuhodo. They are cheaper and better than MAC. (i.e. J5522 is $20 and MAC 224 is $32? and they are similar brushes). My favorites: Hakuhodo J5523 (Cheaper and better MAC 217 dupe) Hakuhodo J5522 Hakuhodo J146 or J5529 (5529 provides a bit more control because its shorter. 146 will be a bit better at blending because of the longer bristles.) Chikuhodo Z-10 Koyudo BP032 (really great lower lash line blender) Koyudo C011 (better MAC 219 dupe) Mizuho MB-133 (AMAZING for winged liner) MAC 239    I'm just gonna keep it to eye brushes for now :)"
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,Lemimeee,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:22 2015 UTC,"good to know that they are better value, definitely makes me more interested! you're awesome! where do you buy them from?"
MakeupAddiction,3dzszk,Lemimeee,4,Tue Jul 21 01:15:38 2015 UTC,Koyudo and Mizuho can be bought from CDJapan. Chikuhodo can be bought from CDJapan and Beautylish. Hakuhodo has their own website and you can just google that.

MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,Pickles8787,45,Tue Jul 21 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"More ""strobing"" (highlighting) less contouring would be my guess"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,Cristookie,34,Tue Jul 21 15:39:41 2015 UTC,TIL strobing is just another word for highlighting. Right?! Still don't understand why it changed from 'strobing' to 'highlighting'.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,tangygoodness,13,Tue Jul 21 16:22:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously. It's like how over night we went from ""on point"" to ""on fleek.""   What happened?  What is fleek?  What was wrong with point? At least on point made sense."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,dangerstar19,8,Tue Jul 21 18:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't get it either...I am guessing that highlighting implies contouring in conjunction (maybe bringing to mind the severe contouring seen on IG and youtube) whereas strobing implies that you're only highlighting? Idk.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,hellopandaaaa,14,Tue Jul 21 16:41:04 2015 UTC,"That and it is another 'gimmick' for brands. I would expect a lot of stobing palettes and kits to come out soon, kinda like when contour got big so every company released contour kits and palettes and contour specific products like sticks and creams etc."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,not_acatlady,9,Tue Jul 21 17:04:01 2015 UTC,I've also seen that highlighting can be matte with contour (like the highlight in a lot of contour palettes) whereas strobing is using a shimmery highlighter only.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,pistachio-pie,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:15 2015 UTC,I feel like strobing is super intense highlighting. Like the kind that you see in fashion ads.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,alligator124,4,Tue Jul 21 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with a product Mac has had for a while called strobe cream, it's not a new trend they're just using it as another ""trend"" to make money on just like contouring. It's been around forever but now it's more mass marketed. Strobing is more of that dewy finish and highlighting the high points of the face"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,ScrantonStrangler666,2,Tue Jul 21 18:07:21 2015 UTC,Great insight. Thanks! I kinda feel compelled to check that cream out now.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,tangygoodness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:59 2015 UTC,"Except mac didn't start the trend ""strobing,"" makeup users and it's customers did. So no, it's not a ploy by mac to make more money, they just happen to have made a product that people named a technique after"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,wake--up,3,Tue Jul 21 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"What about ""baking""? Is it the same thing as strobing? So many terms!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,Sweetlikecandy24,18,Tue Jul 21 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"Baking is when you set your cream concealer, etc. with a thick layer of translucent powder and let it set or ""bake"" for like 10 minutes or so and then dust it off. It's a technique that is big in the drag community. I think that unless you're wearing heavy performance/pancake-type makeup (like drag queens frequently do) it seems unnecessary for regular, everyday makeup."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,kalliope84,11,Tue Jul 21 17:27:27 2015 UTC,"I know this one! I feel like the kid in class that finally gets a question right haha. I saw it the other day in a youtube video. Baking is where you apply liquid product (usually under eye concealer), set it with a shamefully large amount of powder, like way too much, do the rest of your makeup, then brush away the excess powder. It's supposed to keep your makeup from creasing"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,alligator124,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"I think baking is less a look thing and more of a technique. It has helped me tremendously with some visible pores next to my nose on my cheeks. As for strobing, I don't think it is even feasible in the winter...unless you are going for a frost queen look!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,basicwitch,27,Tue Jul 21 17:49:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just the accounts & brands I follow, but I think blue or blueish-purple lips may become a fall trend."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,eraser_dust,10,Tue Jul 21 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"For the amount of money I spend on these colors to wear in the comfort of my apartment or nights out, they had better be!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,the_good_lord1,16,Tue Jul 21 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"I'm noticing a lot of brands putting out colored mascaras, I think that's going to be a thing of some sort. I also see more and more berries and red colors coming out in most brands lipstick and eye shadow/liner lines, not that berries and vampy colors haven't always been a fall/winter trend but more brands seem to be offering colors for it.  Also almost every brand has come out with some sort of eyebrow product."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,dinosaursandunicorns,4,Tue Jul 21 16:28:32 2015 UTC,I used to have a burgundy mascara with a white base on one end and the color on the other (can't recall the brand) that I loved! I hope this happens!
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,Run_bish_ruuun,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:58 2015 UTC,Oh that sounds great! I love burgundy mascara :D I had one from covergirl that I really liked! Clinique just came out with a black honey mascara that looks like a dark red/burgundy.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,dinosaursandunicorns,3,Tue Jul 21 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"I heard about that one, but supposedly it doesn't really show up that well on the lashes :-/ I think that white primer made a big difference in being able to actually see the color."

Thick eyebrows are gorgeous when they're natural, but there is something that I dislike about mostly drawn on powerbrows. It just seems too perfect, almost venturing into uncanny valley to me.  I have no qualms with filling in or shaping brows, but it can easily go too far too me. The fake fade also makes me cringe."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,dappitydap,15,Tue Jul 21 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"I am completely with you. I hate the fake, incredibly perfect eyebrows."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,MelissaGinnJr,5,Tue Jul 21 17:42:35 2015 UTC,Ugh that fade... I hate it!  It looks like a monobrow that slowly goes invisible in the center.
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,SantaFeFoundation,12,Tue Jul 21 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel like the 90's makeup revival is on it's way out, I mean I still love it but it's definitely not as big anymore. I was studying the runway looks from A/W to make graphics for my university application portfolio and it seems that everything is going to be looking fresh, but not too neutral, its obvious you are wearing makeup but not too much. Gloss is coming back after all the matte liquid lipsticks of the summer, and so are metallic shadows and purple and fuschia lips also seem to be big."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,not_acatlady,13,Tue Jul 21 17:36:50 2015 UTC,"Packaging/product innovations are going to play a bigger role in the beauty product narrative, I think. We've already seen trends building around cushion foundations, cream-to-powder textures.   These innovations not only mean that products are improved, but also mean that they apply differently - therefore get associated with a certain 'look'. For example, the cushion blushes will become a bigger deal if the dewy look increases in populatrity."
MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,FreeRangeGirl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:56:43 2015 UTC,"And unfortunately, with the innovations in packaging come price increases i.e. Nars Audacious Lipsticks last year."

MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,nicehotpink,32,Tue Jul 21 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree, actually. With the ridiculous influx of liquid-to-matte lipsticks from nearly every brand, people are going to get burnt out. I know I am already. I want some shimmer and gloss, something new.

MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,nicehotpink,2,Tue Jul 21 17:44:55 2015 UTC,I feel like Too Faced and KVD sort of made that happen last year with their metallic Melted lipsticks and KVDs foiled ones. It seemed to me not to be as big of a deal as mattes in the end. I also bought into the Stila mag metals eyeshadow and wear it so infrequently I wish I hadn't.

MakeupAddiction,3e2yc9,Seracurran,0,Tue Jul 21 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"At Sephora, the ""Trending at Sephora"" animation looks include: feathery brows, electric eyes, berry lips, and glowing skin. Of these, I see feathery brows and berry lips sticking around for fall in a big way. Could be because I hate giant ridiculous brows, but I see power brows as ""fetch"" - stop trying to make it happen. I think strong brows are beautiful, but not the insanely sculpted, obviously penciled-on kind. Feathery brows are a little softer and more human looking. Berry lips are gorgeous. Bite's new lip collection is selling really well, and the new Audacious colors are deep, dark berry shades. I'm looking forward to rocking sheer darkish berry shades this fall!"

MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,hollythehuman,22,Tue Jul 21 13:00:26 2015 UTC,"Your brows look great except, IMO the centimeter closest to the center of your face. You can see the sharp line of where you traced out the front lower line and it looks like product rather than hair. For the front bit, try doing short upward strokes instead of such a line if you want a more natural look. I would even use a darker color if you are going to draw in hairs at that point, since your natural hairs are deep brown while the line under it is a warmer taupey brown."
MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,markrichtsspraytan,9,Mon Jul 20 23:07:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It's honestly very hard to find a matching dipbrow shade..although I have yet to try ebony (most girls at sephora steer my away from it). For the longest time I used dark brown but it was WAY too warm and just looked like brown paint beneath my dark hairs. Oddly enough, medium brown looks less warm and even darker on me.. but like you said it's still a bit too warm."

MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,lolag0ddess,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:12:14 2015 UTC,No I haven't! Just anastasia because of all the hype haha. Do you have any suggestions?
MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,bal-enciaga,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:59 2015 UTC,I actually switched to using the Sephora brow pencil recently instead of my dipbrow in medium brown. I use the darkest shade. I think it's called charcoal black. I loved dipbrow but I got so tired of how long it took to do my brows and medium brown was always too light and warm for my liking. The pencil makes my brow routine so much faster and my brows look better than before.
MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,markrichtsspraytan,4,Tue Jul 21 00:33:11 2015 UTC,Not the previous poster but I use NYX tame and frame in  black and i think it has a nice ashyness to it. Here is a comparison of it with dipbrow in ebony starting at 8:00.
MakeupAddiction,3e02jl,RockyColtTum,4,Mon Jul 20 23:57:35 2015 UTC,NYX tame and frame worked wonders for me when I had dark hair! I honestly liked it a lot more than dipbrow.

I also think there's a difference going on regarding people starting to wear makeup younger, or at least being overall more skilled at it. When I was younger, you learned from your friends, someone's older sister, etc. There are so many resources available now for people to learn and increase their skills."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,-cutestofborg-,9,Tue Jul 21 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"You're so spot on, especially with the second to last sentence. My cousin was 14 when she started filling in her brows to perfection and wearing foundation like a pro. And she learned from youtube. I'd say by 2020 there will be a good portion of women and teenagers as young as 13 who will be skilled at near flawless foundation application, blending eyeshadow, and creating unique looks for their face shape or personal style"
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,chinaamaris,10,Tue Jul 21 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with this. When I was in middle/high school, I just basically taught myself. My mom didn't wear much makeup but she taught me what she knew. I shudder when I think about the poorly applied eyeliner.... yikes."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,mariespunk,4,Tue Jul 21 16:18:57 2015 UTC,My mom taught me what worked for her a few times. She told me To have my face slightly wet before applying foundation but all that did was make my brown skin look incredibly ashy.
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,chinaamaris,5,Tue Jul 21 16:23:27 2015 UTC,"Omg, I swear I tried that before too and I just looked straight up dirty."

MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,LowlyKnave,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:01 2015 UTC,Vaseline! I wonder how she got that to work for her.
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,chinaamaris,2,Tue Jul 21 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure there's a Lisa Eldridge video where she uses a vaseline base to create a 40s/Marilyn look, if you were curious. Looked great on camera with the soft professional studio lighting, but I can't imagine what it must be like as an everyday look."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,spacev1king,6,Tue Jul 21 18:02:48 2015 UTC,"I have students that are barely 14 that have better brow skills and makeup skills than I had back when I was their age. It's phenomenal to me that they get it so freakin fast and I'm over here like... ""How do I brow?"""
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,Xaipete,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"They get it so fast because the pressure to look as good as ""instagram girls"" and appease social media is increasing with every month."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,chinaamaris,3,Tue Jul 21 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing in my school is brows. Even boys are really aware of the effort it takes to do your brows, moreso than my generation was. ""Mrs. ___ has strong brow game.""  It's funny because makeup runs two ways in my district. One, having nice brows is almost a necessity to them. I remember having to have super thin brows in HS, so to each generation his own. But also, wearing too much makeup is actually criticized. Most girls usually max out at eyeliner and mascara. I've probably seen 2 girls with foundation, contour, lipstick and eyeshadow in an entire year. Maybe some red lipstick from time to time, but nowhere near instagram level. I'm sure the pressure is there, but there's still this weird dichotomy of ""natural"" girls vs. ""makeup"" girls. Most girls are right in the middle."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,Xaipete,3,Tue Jul 21 18:39:36 2015 UTC,I also have to agree here. I learned everything I currently know about makeup (at age 22) from watching YouTube videos around age 14/15.
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,corilee93,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:34 2015 UTC,"Is it sad that this kind of bums me out?  Partially because I feel like having terrible makeup is a right of passage of sorts, but mostly because there's already so much pressure on little girls.  Now I feel like there's expectations of them needing to not only wear makeup, but be really good at it as early as 12-14.  My 11 year old sister is already wanting to buy concealer/foundation--her skin is blemish free.  She doesn't even have dark circles.  She's still very much a child.  But that's what all the other girls in school do."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,cicadaselectric,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"I started caring about makeup around 2006/07 and I had no idea there were online tutorials for it. I just taught myself. I never thought to do a search for how to apply gel eyeliner, for example. I feel like nowadays, it's common knowledge to girls as young as elementary school that they can find anything about makeup online."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,laladoodle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially on your first point. I often watch the beauty bloggers applying copious amounts of makeup that I (personally) would never wear on a day-to-day basis but that might photograph more intensely for their Twitter or Instagram pages."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,youareafool,11,Tue Jul 21 18:41:03 2015 UTC,"I think people are more daring with trying out weird colours and you see companies like NYX and Colourpop creating colourful lipsticks that's affordable for most people.  I don't know if it was just because I was a make up noob in 2005, but I felt like back then, if you want a bright green lipstick, you'd probably be going to a costume shop or buying some sketchy looking novelty brand."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,eraser_dust,4,Tue Jul 21 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"Nicer weirdly colored lipsticks are definitely easier to come by now than they have been ever before - but the style during the 2000s was pretty plain compared to previous decades. Smokey eyes, subtle blush and relatively nude lips were the thing. Weird colored lipsticks were actually decently easy to come by in the latter part of the mid-90s (there was kind of a rave/club kid inspired trend thing going on which I guess is kind of having a resurgence now from what I can tell... but I'm in my late 20s so I'm also not paying THAT much attention anymore)... but they all sucked.   Things are definitely more of a free for all now."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,bewareofunicorn,10,Tue Jul 21 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"A lot of things have changed pretty significantly.    I feel like around 2005 was just about round the time when drugstore lines began putting out products that were more consistently worth your while. Sephora and whatnot weren't as huge as they are now, but makeup review sites like Specktra and makeupalley seemed to be actually putting pressure on companies to improve their products. It was becoming so much easier to tell when something was/was not good.  There's been kind of a brand explosion - especially around the mid-range. Sephora in particular has really given room for a lot of brands to flourish and build themselves up - especially with their online store.  Indie brands are everywhere. Better marketplaces for selling your goods, easier ways to promote smaller brands and more have really opened up this market.  Products themselves have changed a lot all around - we're beginning to see longer lasting lip glosses that are not ultra sticky, we're seeing mattes that aren't drying, thin foundations that offer excellent coverage, primers - primers have gotten HUGE in the past decade when they were hardly a thing on most anyone's radar years ago, liquid lipsticks have blown up, eyeshadow formulas are ridiculously elegant nowadays compared to 2005... Just so many things have changed in terms of products that I think it would be really difficult to sum them all up."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,bewareofunicorn,6,Tue Jul 21 16:52:40 2015 UTC,Seconding the product change. Remember in the early 2000s a crying girl would almost always be pictured with smeary black eyes or black tears because of running mascasa? The formulas must have been really terrible back then. Ive cried plenty of times while wearing mascara and never has it ran black down my face.
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,chinaamaris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but last week I discovered that waterproof mascara will run down your face if you work out hard enough ;-)"
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,musicmuse1122,7,Tue Jul 21 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about the shift in the quality of products around the mid '00s. I had been makeup-aware for almost a decade then and I remember feeling like despite wild claims every single drugstore product was a crap shoot in terms of quality. Internet reviews changed everything. And now if a crummy product is released, the whole beauty-web will know inside of a week.   I also remember that around 2000, many drugstores started allowing returns/exchanges of used products. So maybe that had some effect."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,LowlyKnave,2,Tue Jul 21 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"Ohh, you're right, 2000-2010 was when a lot of places began allowing returns of used products. I think it was pretty huge when some of the department stores began to as well."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,bewareofunicorn,14,Tue Jul 21 17:18:35 2015 UTC,"Based on my observations, it seems that makeup artistry and high end makeup is much more of a thing. The average American women bought mostly drugstore, maybe some Mary Kay. While there were makeup counters in department stores, I don't think most women, especially teenagers, gave them much thought. MAC and particularly Sephora have really opened that up. The average woman is now trying advanced makeup techniques like contouring and color correcting. The internet, particularly youtube, has brought techniques from niche groups (runway, professional makeup artists, drag) to the masses. This has resulted in an expansion of high end lines and forced drugstore lines to compete."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,illegalpipedreams,5,Tue Jul 21 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that the public has become much more accepting of darker colors. Chanel Vamp, a deep oxblood, came out in 1995 and it was exotic and edgy. Today there are a million colors just like it. The average woman wears it and it's not seen as goth or trashy."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,illegalpipedreams,0,Tue Jul 21 17:20:53 2015 UTC,"maybe some Mary Kay   We're talking ten years ago, not 25. I was a freshman in college with a very limited budget in 2005, but I still had a UD pallatte, some Mac eyeshadows, and I remember buying my first department store makeup when I was like a freshman in high school (so early 2000s). It was Smashbox.    The average woman is now trying advanced makeup techniques like contouring and color correcting.    I think technique is big difference from ten years ago. As an odd cultural source of inspo (outside of youtube) I credit (or blame?) a lot of this on Le Kardashians."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,muaconcealerhelp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:57 2015 UTC,Same. I still have a few UD shadows and a palette from middle school and I'm 23 now.
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,infamous_jamie,5,Tue Jul 21 18:38:16 2015 UTC,"One thing I remember from even more than 10 years ago is how frosty lipsticks were. I remember my grandmother wearing lipstick in the early nineties and I've since inherited a lot of them since she died, and they are frosty as all hell.   The next thing is packaging. Some of the packaging was downright ugly, and you didn't always know what color something was because there wasn't a sticker or clear lipstick top. Sally Hansen used to sell lipsticks (2004 or so?), and I do remember them having a little color button on them. But I feel like, even with cheaper brands like WnW or NYC, the packaging has improved a lot over what it used to be."
MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,Xaipete,5,Tue Jul 21 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"Makeup ""collections"" are definitely a new thing.  I love watching makeup collection videos, collecting as many eyeshadow palettes as I can, and trying out a million new looks. But my mother and my grandmother had one of what they need, and that's it. One foundation that matched their skin, one blush, maybe two or three lipsticks. They were just adding a touch of color, not creating a flawless contoured finish.  The amount of money we spend on makeup now would have been unheard of in the past. Granted, in the old days ladies would have to go to the pharmacy and have a foundation powder created specifically for them by the pharmacist at a hefty price. But they just had the one foundation powder. In my drawer, I have at least 2 foundations, 3 BB creams, a few powders, concealers...."

MakeupAddiction,3e2xn1,Lewyso,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"Gosh. I've been wearing make up for 11 years now. That's crazy.   Drugstore stuff had barely any pigmentation. Many shadow's gave you a wash of color. Pastel blues, pinks and purples were the shadow of choice back then. Eye liners were not creamy and wonderful. Some drugstore eye shadow's were decent. Maybelline had a single in Amethyst and Revlon had a pink and purple quad. Red eye shadow was impossible to find. Although I had a crappy red eye liner from Hot Topic.   I remember searching how to apply liquid liner on the internet and eventually finding youtube. Game changer. Then my mom bought me my first high end eye shadow palette in 2007 or 08? the Ammo Palette from Urban Decay. Gosh. I used to be so adventurous with color. I wore everything in that little palette."

I also pluck the ends off so I can make them higher.  Here's the only pic I have pre-brow."

MakeupAddiction,3dzx45,kittiemomo,4,Tue Jul 21 15:29:30 2015 UTC,You look great. I have to say your younger self was right about the lipstick. Your lips are really pigmented and you looked good without lipstick. The current shade suits you as well though.

MakeupAddiction,3dzx45,Delilahhaze,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:51:54 2015 UTC,I was always using pretty mid-high end makeup with the exception of eyeshadow. Definitely think the eyeshadow makes a difference in terms of quality and ease of use. Tools made a huge difference too! Especially MAC 217. It's definitely worth the hype. Also really just practice and listening to advice here. Like before I didn't even consider wearing liquid foundation and I like it so much better than powder. Before I didn't know what a transition shade was lol that's made a big difference too. Above all else practice practice practice. When I'm back at a computer I'll show some in between photos.

I'm a vegetarian and it's extremely difficult to figure out whether or not you're putting dead animals on your face. So many things can come from either animal, vegetable or synthetic sources (glycerin, for example, which is in EVERYTHING). Unless I strictly shop vegan brands (which is near impossible unless I order everything online), I'm left with a horrible feeling of uncertainty and being a hypocrite.   It's relatively simple to find out what brands do or don't test on animals by comparison, but it seems a lot of veggies are in the dark about ingredient sources.   So thanks for this, it will be very useful."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,lightning0027,11,Tue Jul 21 16:44:32 2015 UTC,"I think The Balm palettes in general are pretty underrated. Especially the Meet Matte and Nude Tude' palettes. People do talk about them, but if someone asks for neutral palette recommendations Urban Decay, Too Faced, and Lorac are recommended instead. Which is a shame! Because they have a slightly lower price and are amazing quality. Both the matte and shimmer shades are really pigmented and easy to blend out."

MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,bandanaanna,4,Tue Jul 21 18:02:45 2015 UTC,"The palette seems very pigmented to me, even the lighter colors. As long as I use it over a primer, the color stays all day.   My only gripe is that the formula is pretty soft, so there's a lot of fallout in the pan. Haven't noticed any fallout on my face though."

MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,Womenwhokill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Compared to higher end shadows (UD, Lorac Pro), they're not that nice IMO.  But I owned this palette prior to owning anything nicer and I loved it.  They're a bit harder to work with, but I could certainly do dark, smoky looks.  And the variety meant I had eyebrow shades no matter how I dyed my hair.  I used the fuck out of this palette and think it's a good beginner one to learn on.  Also, there's a lot of variety between shades.  Like one of the lightest colors I used daily as an inner corner/brow highlight, and one of them I couldn't get to show up to save my life."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,cicadaselectric,3,Tue Jul 21 18:53:18 2015 UTC,I love this palette for matte eyes . It has a really good rating on makeup alley  and Jackie aina and Kathleenlights like it to (two trusted gurus here I think ) Similar and better shade selection then the kat Von d shade + light palette . The shadows are definetly on the drier side but I use eyeshadow primer for all my eyeshadow a anyways
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,Cristookie,5,Tue Jul 21 18:09:42 2015 UTC,"I like my Tarte BeMATTEnificent. I bought it, honestly, for the pretty case but it's such a good palette. I have dark hair and eyes and the pinks/purples are great, plus it has a nice plum blush in it too."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,sakana-no-ko,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:23 2015 UTC,"That is a really nice palette. It is the only time I've ever bought a product purely because of the packaging; my grandfather was a geologist, and the packaging reminded me of his collection of thundereggs. I was happy to discover that the product itself was really nice, too, but I think I would have kept it for sentimental reasons even if it hadn't been any good."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,ospiteohell,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:47 2015 UTC,"Since then I've bought a few more Tarte things (I took advantage of that Tarte sale that was posted here awhile back; the 5 colormatched things for $80 or whatever, and I bought some brow mousse) and any men that come over see my makeup always think it's funny that I use a brand called Tarte. I thought they'd laugh hardest at my Naked palette, but nope, they think Tarte is funnier."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,sakana-no-ko,3,Tue Jul 21 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"I hardly ever see posts about the Coastal Scents 252 palette. It's freaking 252 eyeshadows for $25! Sure, some of them are duds, but most of them are really pigmented and good quality. It was my first ~real palette~ [not a quad/trio or from e.l.f.] and I still use it a lot. The sheer amount of shades is fantastic."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,zeugma_kerfuffle,5,Tue Jul 21 17:40:19 2015 UTC,The glitter bombs in that palette were always the creamiest to me. The matte shadows were usually bunk. The 252 palette was popular on here about a year and a half ago. Now it's sort of fallen out of favor.
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,Xaipete,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"The Lorac Pro To Go, obviously the Pro itself is a common favorite but I've never seen anyone here mention the To Go version. I love it and use it every day that I wear makeup for over a year now. I can make so many different looks with it. But the best part is that is if I am going anywhere long enough to want makeup, I throw in that beauty, mascara, an eyebrow pencil, and a tinted moisturizer and I'm set."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,mercedes314,3,Tue Jul 21 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"The Sleek Au Naturel palette! I use mine all the time, it has great pigmentation and it's so versatile."
MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,laser_wombat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"YES, came here to say the same thing! It is a brilliant everyday palette but is also great because it has glittery shades which can amp up your look. I use two matte shades on my brows and the rest all work really well on the eyes. I have completely hit pan on the white shade. I also like it because of the purpley shade, which I didn't think I would use that much but it's more on the browny purple shade and works really well in the outer corner. I just think it is so varied for such an inexpensive palette, it has cool browns, olivey browns, there are orangey shades and it can work with different skin tones and eye colour."

MakeupAddiction,3e37p2,darthmimi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I just got one of the customizable Buxom palettes.  I love it.  The shades are pigmented and easily blendable (I prefer it to palettes from the Lorac Pro line and UD Naked line).  The options are beautiful.  I love customizing, and I think it's a great deal.  It's also fairly compact, which is nice for travel or the gym.  Plus you can pick colors that you'll actually use.  While I'm sure some of the shades will get used more than others, I'm not stuck with anything I won't ever really use.  Plus the shadows are full size, not itty bitty, so I don't think I'll hit pan as fast.  I literally cannot recommend it enough."
MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,Oifr,9,Tue Jul 21 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what it is as to how often I repurchase it and/or if I will even repurchase it. Generally everything I repurchase is a staple/basic item - not things like blush or lipstick.   Things I've repurchased:    My favorite foundation a few times (Koh Gen Do Maifanshi Moisture Foundation), it lasts me around 6-7 months per tube with near daily use and I'm on my third tube.  My favorite mascara around every 6 months - though sometimes I'll skip 6 months to test something else out... but at the moment I'm mostly set on only buying Chanel le Volume in the future.  I generally repurchase primer every 6-9 months. I recently switched to a different formula, but my previous one I bought twice. Fresh Advanced Therapy Lip Treatment - I've bought this about three times, a tube generally lasts me around a year. I'm about to repurchase a colored lip product for the first time. My tube of the Dior Fluid Stick in Wonderland has reached the point where it's practically empty, I've blown through it in a year which is pretty unusual given just how many lip products I own... so clearly it's definitely worth repurchasing since I love it so much.     Everything else I agree... you tend to get bored of it with time - but when you find things you really love and really work for you, it's easy to buy them again instead of going after something else just because it's different."
MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,bewareofunicorn,6,Tue Jul 21 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"a) every 4-6 months.  b) pretty much only concealer, eyeliner and brow pencil.  c) those are the products that get the most use and also happen to be sold in the smallest increments. my concealer and brow pencils come from NYX, which I never really restock on unless the 40% off sale is on, and my eyeliner can really be bought whenever since its the $2.99 one from Essence, but I honestly can't be bothered to drive to ULTA just to spend that.   The products I never find myself repurchasing are lipstick and eyeshadow, but those don't get a whole lot of use from me anyway. Its hard for me to finish an entire palette or an entire tube of lipstick, but I can't really be left in the lurch for things that are staple to my routine."

MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,krokodilchik,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"There are 3 products that I've found to repurchase more than others over the past few years.   Covergirl mascara: I repurchase this roughly once every 2 months. I love it, use it every day, and nothing gets me more excited than new mascara! Revlon colorstay foundation for oily skin. I need a new one roughly once every 4 months. I've used higher end foundations and haven't noticed a difference between the two where I would spend $30 extra on a foundation. NYX baked blushes and maybelline fit me blushes, I alter between the two based in shimmer vs. Matte finishes and this seems to be my third most repurchased products."
MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,bonbon__,3,Tue Jul 21 14:54:26 2015 UTC,"I don't repurchase things very often because I don't wear makeup every day. however, there are a few things I have repurchased   1- MUFE full cover concealer. I repurchased this because my other concealer was over a year old and since I sometimes use it on my lips I was getting a little disgusted.   2- cover girl perfect point plus eyeliner. this is one of my favorite eyeliners since it's cheap, the formula is nice, and it's a mechanical liner, which is my favorite type.   3- maybelline one by one volum' express. or, I would have repurchased this if I was able to find it anywhere. it's my favorite black drugstore mascara formula and I'm about to run out of it. I cry."
MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,lightning0027,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"I buy new mascara and eyeliner every six months because that's generally when they expire. Anything going near my eyes I take seriously because eye infections are horrible. Usually around 6 months is when my mascara dries up or starts feeling gunky. Toss it out.  Foundation I replace about every 6-9 months when I run out. And I usually run out, either emptying the pump, tube, or hitting pan on a powder. I'll typically buy the same brand, because it's hard to find just the right shade/formula and when you do nail down your holy grail foundation, you don't want to start the exhaustive search/experimentation process all over again.   Eye shadows are a bit different. I'll replace single shadows that I use frequently as base colors (like Mac Blanc Type) about every 9 months because I simply use them up quickly. I'll keep big palettes around a little longer. I'll probably hit pan on a few shades and try to use up the others, then eventually toss it after 1-2 years. I don't always buy the same palette, I'll shop around for something new and interesting.  Lipsticks and glosses I basically keep until I use them up. Lipsticks last me 2-3 years, glosses I burn through much quicker. I go through a tube of Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey about once a year. And I go through Sugar Lip Treatment in exactly 9 months according to my Sephora purchase history. My tubes of Mac Russian Red and Viva Glam III have lasted me a long time."

MakeupAddiction,3e2qew,arieanimal,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:15 2015 UTC,"I've re-bought foundation and concealer, but that's pretty much it. I don't like having to experiment to find shades to match my skin so when I find foundation and concealer that work, I stick with them. Everything else? I like a lot of things but it's a whole big wide world of makeup and there are always new things to try.  Plus, I always kind of thought that constant renewal can help to keep you out of a rut. I knew a woman who wore the same lipstick for decades, until it was discontinued. She was so disappointed but honestly, the frosty pink thing had moved on, and I secretly thought she should too. This was years ago, but it stuck with me that I never wanted to be that habitual that my makeup didn't evolve with the years."

Coincidentally, before I get to finish the first one, I will most likely find something better, so that the duplicates sit alone and forgotten on the bottom of a drawer. Ugh!   Other than that, I repurchase mascara every couple of months, since it expires, and a powder once a year when I finish it. I also have a shitton of $1 Elf primers which I love, burn through, and did not find anything better to replace with (I know everyone here is raving about WnW but it's not available where I live unfortunately. I have tried I Heart Stage from Essence and Benefit Stay Don't Stray but honestly, Elf works a lot better for me), so I repurchase several every time I make an Elf order (couple of times a year)."

I have enough variety when it comes to colours(eyeshadow, blush, lip products) to last me a while so I haven't repurchased those type of products. However, I am picky about base products so this is where I repurchase a lot.    Some examples are      YSL TTE foundation. I think I am on my 4th bottle now. I have some others in my rotation but this is the one I always come back to.  byTerry Touche Veloutee. This blows YSL Touche Éclat out the window. More coverage but with the same illuminating properties. I'm on my 3rd tube after discovering it in a French Sephora about two years ago.  Anastasia Brow Wiz.

I regularly repurchase primer (Benefit Porefessional), foundation (NARS Sheer Glow), concealer (NARS Creamy Concealer), mascara (CG CC), setting spray (UD All Nighter) and chapstick. There are a few products I have repurchased, but probably won't need to for a while, such as a few lipsticks, NARS Tonkin and MAC Ruby Woo, and a cream eyeshadow from Benefit. I repurchase because these items are a staple in my routine, and/or I've lost it, such as my Ruby Woo. Added bonus, random things I will be repurchasing soon - MAC Lady Danger (running out), liquid eyeliner (either Stila, Tarte or Lorac) and eyeshadow primer (might try the NARS instead of TF or UD)."

I've repurchased Hourglass Illusion foundation and NARS creamy concealer a few times, because they work vastly better for me than anything else I've tried. I can't think of any...let's call them ""decorative"" products that I've repurchased, since I have such an unnecessarily extensive makeup stash and I rotate through things.   I guess I've also repurchased the josie maran 47 spf moisturizer and seche vite topcoat, if those count as makeup items. I'm also almost out of Clinique Naturally Glossy mascara and I will probably repurchase that once I use up my stash of samples."

For me, that would be: Yu-Be Skin Cream (cured my dry skin), Too Faced Eyeshadow Primer (keeps my shadow and winged eyeliner on for 12+ hours, just as intense as it was when I first applied it), and beautyblender. There are other products that I like a lot, but I have to be absolutely convinced that no other similiar product can do better or I'll try something different."

MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,Pharmapill,3,Tue Jul 21 02:27:30 2015 UTC,this is the only liner I've ever loved. Any recommendations on something with a similar applicator but longer lasting product?
MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,Pharmapill,4,Tue Jul 21 07:06:07 2015 UTC,"Ah! See, this is half of the reason I thought of this. I can't always afford good eyeliners (I do splurge for UD's 24/7 Glide On Eye Pencils in Perversion for my outer corner waterline - but that will last me for a few months), so I have to go with drugstore brands for my liquid eyeliners. I have oily eyelids regardless of whatever hoodoo/voodoo magical sacrifices I make, snakedances I dance, it just doesn't matter! I always end up with that stupid black half-moon about 30 minutes after I apply eye liner to my lids with either liquid or pencils.   However, gel liners, for some reason, are so much longer lasting on me, and don't give me that black half moon nearly as bad as other liners...but I can't, for the life of me, use a brush. That's when I figured this out."

MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,dazy5,3,Tue Jul 21 07:45:37 2015 UTC,"Not who you were aiming the question at, but I don't think it picks up enough product either. I have used it for gel liner, but I had to keep going back to get more. With an actual brush, I guess the product slips in between the brush hairs and lasts longer, whereas the silicone brush cannot do this and so the product wipes off quickly."

MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,TangyExplosives,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"I have it but only use it for very fine detail, like the inner corner of my eye or to get a fine point on wings. It doesn't pick up enough product to do the whole eye. I use an angled brush for most of my eyeliner."
MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,SenoraRamos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. It doesn't fray out like normal brushes do, and it doesn't dry out like felt tip eyeliner markers do. It's not going to pick up enough product on your first swipe to completely finish it, but it's super precise to get that prefect outline and then you can grab more product. Here's how mine turned out. That's just an everyday look, but it definitely works well for dramatic, nighttime eye looks as well! I highly recommend, especially if you've always had trouble making a clean wing.      Edit: I have hooded eyes, so this brush is also great at keeping your lines thin so they're actually visible under the hood."

MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,originalaliswan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:52 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try that if I can find a brush tapered enough. Believe me, I've tried. My problem is that I've lost about 40% of the eyesight in my right eye, so my right eyelid usually turns pretty good, but when it comes time to do the left eyelid, all bets are off haha. I've found that I have pretty good control with the felt tip because I know where the tip is going, unlike with a brush and perhaps a stray brush hair here and there."
MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,MakeupNoob03,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"That's a great suggestion!! I quite like the brush that comes with the Maybelline gel liner because I feel like it's pretty pointed/easy to use in that regard, but I bet a felt tip liner would work out amazing."

MakeupAddiction,3e08vq,Ayyeashliee_,3,Tue Jul 21 11:26:40 2015 UTC,"91% alcohol (or the highest % you can find). Just keep dip-and-wiping until it comes clean. Plus, I'm the only one using it, so I'm not that worried about it. It's just like cleaning brushes; wipe it off as soon as you're finished, and give it a good cleaning regularly until the felt starts to fray, I'd say."

Corvus Cosmetics Mademoiselle: base shadow Corvus Cosmetics Cherie: transition color My Pretty Zombie Epistaxis: crease color My Pretty Zombie Fresh Scab: darken the crease Corvus Cosmetics Atargatis: main lid color Corvus Cosmetics Thessalonike: add dimension to the lid Wet n' Wild Fergie primer NYX eye shadow base in black L'Oreal Voluminous Carbon Black Blinc Amplified mascara NYX Micro Brow Pencil in Black ABH Brow Powder Duo in Granite Dreamworld Hermetica foundation in Arianrhod II Cloud Bite Agave lip mask in Champagne   My flower of choice was the rose, and I wanted to bring in the graveyard theme by using silver/grey to represent headstones and statues. Atargatis was especially perfect for this because it has green sparkles to contrast with the red and incorporate grass into the look. Thessalonike is a nice dirt gray, and Mademoiselle and Cherie are both from Corvus' ""The Roses"" collection. Since Dru is a vampire, I thought it fitting that the reds are both inspired by blood (Epistaxis means nosebleed).    Do you like daisies? I plant them, but they always die.

My concealer (Estee Lauder Doublewear in the little blue compact) works fine to cover it though.   Which concealer are you using and how are you applying it?  I like to use a small brush to kinda stipple concealer on and then let it sit for a couple of minutes before blending and setting it with a bit of powder.

MakeupAddiction,3dz437,RevengeOfSalmacis,5,Mon Jul 20 21:31:52 2015 UTC,"Orange is indeed usually best for color correcting beard shadow. (That's something I do not miss about the days before I had my face lasered fifteen times.) Plot twist: because hair removal is usually patchy at first, it isn't unusual to have to color correct in patches and strips, avoiding areas where the beard is already gone forever. This involves annoying amounts of precision and means one absolutely has to minimize things sliding around or things will start to look really odd. (Beard shadow color correction for trans women is very different than drag makeup beard shadow color correction, both because the beard shadow isn't as likely to be a clear shape thanks to hair removal, and because thick stage makeup isn't an option. This does mean a very careful touch is needed. Honestly, I'd still be looking for ways to do it better if I had any beard shadow left to conceal.)"

MakeupAddiction,3dz437,FeralDrood,4,Mon Jul 20 21:35:36 2015 UTC,Do you have any tips for controlling/hiding facial hair?
MakeupAddiction,3dz437,trace_mo,9,Mon Jul 20 21:20:39 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, texture is one of the hardest problems to correct.   Ensure that you're getting the closest shave possible, which might mean switching from a disposable razor or electric shaver to a safety razor. It's much more cost effective to use a fresh razor blade each time and ensuring the super close shave. Pertilude on YouTube had a video on 5 o'clock Shadow correcting. If you don't have actual growth and just the dark shadow as it barely grows in, you'll have to color correct as he mentions.    If you do regrow very quickly and gets length with a few hours, I would stick to makeup that is easy to blend and touch up. Getting a little eyebrow shaver to go quickly over the area and then reapply might be the best way if you regrow your facial hair like Harry Potter when Aunt Petunia gave him haircuts. There's really no fool-proof way to combat the texture.  If your hair is very thin, you might get away with treating it like peach fuzx and blend downwards to mat it down."
MakeupAddiction,3dz437,FeralDrood,4,Mon Jul 20 21:34:29 2015 UTC,"As a woman that deals with facial hair e.g., sideburns, jaw, pretty much the standard beard area, this is what I do.  I tend to go between a sharp razor (like one for eyebrows), an actual battery-run mustache trimmer,  and facial hair removing cream.  Ulta sells all of these.    My face can be sensitive or dont have the time to spend on it.  so I tend to use the facial cream once a month or so.  For me it last roughly like 9-10days.  The mustache trimmer is like a size of a marker or pencil.  It gets the job done, but doesnt get a close cut like the eyebrow razor.  I only recently started using it.  I use it around my eye brows and on part of my sideburns.  And use it around my mouth where is it hard to get perfect with the batter powered mustache trimmer.    If you are dealing with a five o'clock shadow,  you might want to look into laser hair removal.  Depending where you live,  it can be affordable.  For me,  laser hair removal is exactly what I want.  But I cant budget it (unemployed).    You could also try waxing your face.  If you do I would either suggestion going to a salon or having a friend help.  I found it very difficult trying to pull of a strip with either speed.   I hope that helps!"
MakeupAddiction,3dz437,trace_mo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"This is my issue too, I'm a woman that has to deal with shaving every single day.

And it makes me feel good to know that another woman feels my pain haha"
MakeupAddiction,3dz437,FeralDrood,2,Tue Jul 21 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe moisturizing with oils would help?  I like to toss on some coconut, jojoba, hempseed, and argan everyone add then (not all at once).  I also use a nighttime moisturizer from aveeno .  But I do think the the natural oils have helped with my facial hair issues, and lessens my skins reaction to all the creams and razors  The ladies at /r/naturalskincare might have more to say about it.   I am surprised to hear the lazer hair removal didnt work.  I am out in Fl,  and am constantly hearing how great IdealImage is on the radio(Male and female radio DJs that get free services).

I had probably seven or eight sessions of laser removal and the short-term results were great, but here I am about 6 years later and it hasn't lasted at all. It might even be heavier or worse now, or maybe I'm just noticing it more now. I just didn't have the money to continue putting myself through the physical and financial torture, especially if it's not going to be permanent :/  I also hear about ideal image here in Rhode Island with the ratio djs too, now I wonder if there's any truth to the advertisement at all."

MakeupAddiction,3e2g2v,Beauty_sandwich,2,Tue Jul 21 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second the idea of going with stains - they stay in place, you can generally put a bit of a balm on them after they set to counteract the dryness. At a little bit of a pricier point there are the YSL Glossy Stains and personally I'm really fond of Vincent Longo's Lip Stains (really about the only stand out product in that line) since they're not overly drying as they set and they can pack a lot of color, plus the formula isn't overly runny so it's easier to work with than some other stains."

One night (while scrolling MUA) I decided I needed Maybelline Divine Wine and I would wear the shit out of it.  All it took was loving a color and forcing myself to wear lipstick regularly for a week or two.  Now, I wear super-dark and black lipstick just because I can."
MakeupAddiction,3e2g2v,PinkPonySwag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"Sugar lip treatments by Fresh are my absolute favorite for days when I want to wear lipstick... I know it's not really what you asked for, but they glide on smoothly and are highly pigmented but are forgiving enough that I usually apply them without a mirror. They hydrate your lips SO well and when they wear off, they don't flake or smudge, they just kind of fade away.   I usually wear Passion (linked), but the other shades are nice too! Rose is softer option if you don't want something so pigmented."
MakeupAddiction,3e2g2v,tsuruyo,0,Tue Jul 21 18:59:54 2015 UTC,What if you challenger yourself to wear lipstick every day for a week and don't allow yourself to look in the mirror more than once? I think you'd get used to wearing it pretty quickly. I'd also suggest looking for more lightweight hydrated formulas. They are expensive but I found that NARS Audacious feels the absolute best on my lips and looks good hours later even after eating. Maybe try ordering a lipstick or two from Makeup Exchange to test formulas?
MakeupAddiction,3e2qsl,noodledoodledoo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:23 2015 UTC,"I bought this recently and haven't had any issues, but I use a patting motion as someone suggested already here. I tend to do that with eyeshadows in general, as I find it gives me better results across all brands."
MakeupAddiction,3e2qsl,-cutestofborg-,2,Tue Jul 21 15:16:22 2015 UTC,"Very strange. I've had my expensive pink for a while so it's possible they've changed their formula, but it's probably one of my favourite Mac eyeshadows, I used to use it everyday (along with antiqued).  I would generally apply mine with the Mac 239 eye shader brush, or with my fingers. What kind of brush are you using? Try a flat shader brush and pat on the colour and maybe that will help?"
MakeupAddiction,3e2qsl,themelissa,3,Tue Jul 21 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Not just you, it's a dry dusty formula. Try wetting your brush before you apply (not soaking, and pick up from a corner of the pan). This would bring out more of the gold duochrome though.    Alternatively, those cheap sponge applicators? Use slowly to pack it on.    EDIT: some other suggestions: a tacky base helps a lot, I've heard a lot of good things about the wet n'wild fergie primer, and also a patting motion onto your eyelid instead of swiping as you mentioned, helps the shadow adhere better.    Apologies if these are some things you've tried already :-)"

I don't think it has a built in smudger, but it's still worth checking out. If you're not opposed to different methods of application, I have the l'oreal gel liner in a pot that I apply with a brush, and I find that to be super pigmented too (and significantly cheaper than the MJ liner)."

MakeupAddiction,3e0uzq,youngandstarving,12,Tue Jul 21 05:37:13 2015 UTC,PayPal might still be able to help you. They give you something like 180 days (don't quote me exactly on the number but it's seriously really long) to open a case.

MakeupAddiction,3e0uzq,llamallamalizard,4,Tue Jul 21 02:27:01 2015 UTC,"Whoops, fixed now. Thanks!"
MakeupAddiction,3e0uzq,PsychedelicCucumber,6,Tue Jul 21 02:37:53 2015 UTC,"I bought a 2 pack for 14$ on ebay. I didn't leave feed back because I didn't use it yet. When I opened one up to use it, there was a little in the cap already that appeared that someone tried to wipe out. I didn't think too much then, maybe they tried it didn't like it, type thing. Then I was  fiddling around with the tube with the cap on while talking to my husband, and then I went to take the cap off to use it and the tube tip pops off and falls in the sink. What the fuck?? So then I feel the tube and it feels really flatish. I squeezed what was there to the top,  and there was only half a fucking tube! Same with the other one I had. I was livid. I double checked at Ulta that save evening before they closed, and their tubes were definitely a lot fuller by far.   Then I realized I was duped. I was furious. I also realized it had been a month and I wasn't going to probably get my $14 back. But I guess I didn't care I had one combined tube, it was legit TooFace, I had another one in my car and compared them. So to be honest, I just left really horrible feedback. It was negative of course, no stars given besides the auto for free shipping.  I called her a scammer. Not checking her products before selling, half full. I filled that little 140 character box with as much blunt, exact, anger I could. A few days later she sent me a message saying that she sells them all the time,  I must have gotten a 'bad one', bitch I had TWO! And that she does check her products,  then why was there concealer in the cap?? She went on to say that me being honest is damaging to her and my one bad review ruined her. The review didnt, she did by not selling her products with integrity.  I also wasn't the first negative review she had. So it wasn't like I broke her 100% cherry.   I buy mixed lots all the time, sometimes just for a product or two, then resell them later that month with other stuff I had collected.  I recheck everything before I sell it because it is my responsibility.  I take the fall if this is not the way I advertise it.   Lesson learned, double check everything IMMEDIATELY after buying, even if you may not use it for a bit.   Edit, replied wrong place,  whoops!"
MakeupAddiction,3e0uzq,5edgy,9,Tue Jul 21 11:39:46 2015 UTC,"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."
MakeupAddiction,3e1njz,myfirstnamewas,21,Tue Jul 21 07:09:56 2015 UTC,"If certain makeup is leaving your skin feeling burnt I would quit using it altogether.  Your skin should definitely not feel like that, it sounds like you are having an allergic reaction.  Which will get worse each time.    Regarding the shimmer problem.  Shimmer will always hi light pores and imperfections.  Even if I put concealer over a blemish and then a shimmery product it still shows up.  So I just try to avoid problematic areas tbh."

MakeupAddiction,3e1njz,tkjoy,7,Tue Jul 21 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, shimmer just accentuates uneven texture :( I broke out badly on my cheeks a few months ago and I basically stopped using highlighter for that time because it would just make every bump stand out.   If it's scarring and pores that are your main issues, you could try a pore filling primer beforehand. It might help!"
MakeupAddiction,3e1njz,tkjoy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:58:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I wasn't sure if there were any techniques people used.

MakeupAddiction,3e1njz,whyalwaysboris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:00:37 2015 UTC,"There are definitely methods to make it less noticeable but in general, if you want to draw attention away from uneven texture, matte is your best bet"
MakeupAddiction,3e1njz,flawlessqueen,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:10 2015 UTC,"I avoid any shimmery products because my skin is not exactly perfect. Shimmer just accentuates any issues I have. Also, Bare Minerals causes my skin to feel dry and burned. It also causes me to break out. If you're using something that makes your skin feel that way you should definitely stop.   By the way, I have incredibly sensitive skin and I have had good luck with Laura Mercier liquid and powder foundation. It's pricey, but has been worth it."

I think it is very versatile!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,15,Mon Jul 20 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"This isn't make-up related, but still in the beauty realm - what do you do for your hair? Is that it's natural texture or do you style it with products/tools? Looks similar to mine after I work on it a bit, but I'm trying to cut down on the time it takes."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,30,Mon Jul 20 04:02:22 2015 UTC,"I wish i could say i have some super styling secret, but that's just my natural texture! Although, a couple things that help my waves look nice is that i co-wash (washing with silicone-free conditioner only, no shampoo), and i don't use heat on my hair. I just let it air dry. If I want my hair to be really wavy and voluminous, at night i'll spritz my hair with water so it's a little damp (or 90% air-dried if i took a shower), then french braid it and sleep on it. Then i take it out in the morning and voila! Beautiful, natural-looking waves all day. just make sure to braid it as far down as you can to avoid an awkward straight part at the bottom haha"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lallybroch876,14,Mon Jul 20 04:06:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's amazing to me, haha. I wish I could fully air-dry, but my hair just stays eternally damp without heat. Do you have problems with getting too oily using only conditioner?"
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Inkwell1988,54,Mon Jul 20 04:35:32 2015 UTC,"I have stupidly thick hair, so i also have the eternally damp problem, but unless i'm going somewhere that requires me to actually look nice, i take all my fucks and throw them out the window. Also I take showers at night so my hair is dry in the morning haha.   And no, not at all. The opposite actually. When you co-wash, you don't strip your hair's natural oils like shampoo does, so your scalp doesn't freak and over-produce oil. It HAS to be silicone free though (no dimethicone or other -cone ingredients), because silicone isn't water soluable, so it has to be washed out with shampoo. Then it's just a vicious circle. With silicone free conditioner (i like Suave naturals or Tresemme's new silicone free conditioner), you just saturate you hair with it, massage it like you would shampoo, and rinse it out with water and you're good to go! Much healthier for your hair and will extend the time it takes for your hair to look greasy. Check out /r/FancyFollicles, they have a ton of great info about it!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,Inkwell1988,7,Mon Jul 20 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"Co-wash for life!   Even works with straight hair that began to have oil overproduction issues. I used to be so oily that I thought I had to wash it every day (sometimes twice a day), but now I'm good for 3/4 and the I do a dry shampoo day and start over. As a working mom of two, this saves my time."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,1_800_COCAINE,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"Does co-washing work to remove product, too? I have a pixie cut and usually wear a pomade or something that I feel a need to wash out before bed."

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,wake_and_vape,5,Mon Jul 20 06:05:42 2015 UTC,Would you mind sharing which conditioner you use and your general process? I looked on r/fancyfollicles but there's no general thread
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,missgonzo,37,Mon Jul 20 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"Sure! I started out with Suave Naturals, but right now i'm using Tresemme's Perfectly (un)Done conditioner. I wet my hair, the squeeze out the excess water. Then i completely saturate my hair with conditioner (and i mean completely. you're going to use A LOT of conditioner. That's why Suave is good because it's cheap). I run a wide-tooth comb through my hair to distribute the product evenly (you don't have to do this, i just like to because my hair is so thick), then i massage the conditioner in for a few minutes. I like to sing a song as loud as i can, or pretend i'm being interviewed on the Tonight Show during this time. Then, rise the conditioner out completely. If you rinse it all out, your hair should not be weighed down or oily looking. Let dry and there you have it! I was so surprised how soft my hair was the first time i did this, and that it was actually clean! And after doing it for a couple months, my hair can go up to week before it looks greasy and needs washing (I do not recommend testing out how long you can go if you have to be around people. It's the summer, i'm in a cave of laundry and netflix. But my hair looks fabulous)."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,missgonzo,9,Mon Jul 20 06:23:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for taking the time to type this out and fully explain it! I have straight, fine hair but a lot of it and co washing seems to work best for ladies with curly and thick hair. Would this work? Also, how do you know when the conditioner is washed out?

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,lahema,7,Tue Jul 21 06:51:09 2015 UTC,So u see you've used the dip brow and the brow wiz. How do you use them both? :/
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,yoyohydration,27,Mon Jul 20 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"I use the Taupe dipbrow to fill my brows and block out the shape, then I use the brow wiz in a darker color to clean up the tails, define the edges, and darken any sparse areas not taken care of by the dipbrow. Using a lighter color pomade and a darker pencil allows me to get a consistent, even brow without having to use a dark color all over and end up looking like Groucho Marx, which is easy because my brows are very blonde haha. I hope that makes sense!"

The only CC I would give would to maybe blend out the inner corners of your eyeshadow a teeny bit. On the left eye in particular it seems a little harsh around where it lays by tearduct and like it doesn't really blend to your skin. If that was intentional though just ignore me!  Also, is that your natural hair color? Because it's gorgeous and I am so jealous. I've been trying to achieve a shade like that for almost a year as I attempt to go back to my natural color."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,whoopiepiez,4,Mon Jul 20 05:17:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know if i see what you're talking about. The little lines extending in the inner corner from my lashline? Because that was intentional haha. But thank you!  And no, but it's VERY close. i have about 6 inches of roots right now so you can see my natural color on top in the pictures. I dyed my hair dark brown a year ago and the color you see on the bottom is the result of three separate salon visits to get back to my natural color. I loved my brown hair but being a blonde, my roots shone like a beacon of laziness in the sun. The struggle."

I know that struggle, you look like your balding if you don't recolor the roots within a week or so of them showing. D: It was such a hassle when I had darker hair. We look to have about the same natural color then, it's a really hard color to match with dye."

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,whatxever,6,Mon Jul 20 10:12:14 2015 UTC,"Forgive me if this sounds weird....  But your last picture, while hilarious, totally made me feel awesome. A lot of times you see these posts by girls who do AMAZING makeup, everything is so on point and their post is so put together and infromative and it's down right daunting. Everything is perfection. Color selection, blending, lighting, hair, you name it. Like how can I ever achieve this look put together by this wizard?!?!?!   Your first couple photos totally had me feeling that way and then the last photo made me laugh and realize - Holy shit, this is a real person! Maybe I can do it! Haha."
MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,steadyasthepenisdrum,2,Mon Jul 20 17:20:38 2015 UTC,Thank makes me so happy! Makeup is totally a skill anyone can learn with practice. And it's hilarious to wash off! I'm so glad you liked my post. :)

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,jen283,3,Mon Jul 20 07:21:18 2015 UTC,"I love your contour! This is something I've been trying to practice and get good at. I recently went to ulta and got some cream bronzer... I was taught how to out the creme down and powder on top and it looks amazing. I however, can't get the hang of the creme down and I can't get my powder Contour to look like yours.  It's awesome!!!"

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,snowbaby0413,3,Mon Jul 20 13:23:16 2015 UTC,The eyes are killer. You're serving a little Angelina in the second picture too! When using a graphic liner I try to do the side that is harder first then it helps that the side of the face that is generally easier to do is easier to make even. Cuts the back and forth trying to even it out for me.

MakeupAddiction,3dwfmx,feminazi4ever,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:11 2015 UTC,You have such big beautiful eyes!
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,slutwithoutthe-u,10,Mon Jul 20 19:10:02 2015 UTC,Hello fellow UK person!  MUA Undress Your Skin highligher is my jam!  The slight tint you have to your lips is really pretty particularly as it blends in well with such a subdued look.  One thing I would say is... I think your eyebrows could be much darker. Atm you're almost blonde whereas I think you should be closer to Chocolate or Dark Brown. I used that picture 'cause DIP DIP was the first product to come to mind.  I can imagine you thinking that the change would be rather stark compared to your natural brow but I'm guessing you've dyed your hair and I think your eyebrows would match up better with a darker product (not necessarily more heavily applied considering this understated look).
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,Blacknarcissa,4,Mon Jul 20 20:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yes I love it!  This is quite a light brow for me, I do go a bit darker for stronger looks but am always wary of going to dark! So maybe I will get a darker product, thanks. Also Ive really wanted to try dipbrow but never been sure on what shade and if I can justify the cost on a student budget!"
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,Blacknarcissa,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:46 2015 UTC,I have Dark Brown. It's great! I bought it online for like 15quid. More than I would usually spend but it lasts foreverrrrr!
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,Blacknarcissa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:23 2015 UTC,Thats cheaper than I thought maybe I will give it a go!
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,cowbundles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"Same, I thought it'd be more expensive. I think I got it from here"
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,ihateureddit,5,Tue Jul 21 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are gorgeous without makeup!  Edit: And with, of course! Very smooth and even application. <3"
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,SnarkleSparkle,4,Mon Jul 20 19:50:51 2015 UTC,I love it! It's so soft and pretty and your foundation application is great. The only CC I have is I think a touch of contour along the top sides of your forehead will help balance out your features even more. Otherwise I really like it :) brows look great
MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,djmashupredsthe3rd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:45:09 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I was going to suggest the same thing with contour as my only CC, so I'll just +1 this."

MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,merely93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:37:46 2015 UTC,"No this is the compact powder, the original one, not sure if it has a name but its kind of pink as I know they've now brought out a gold toned one. I really like it, its subtle but quite shimmery so it depends if you like that in a highlight."

MakeupAddiction,3dz9z7,nothingisred,2,Mon Jul 20 19:49:54 2015 UTC,I genuinely appreciate how subtle it all is. kudos! that always seemed to be an even greater task than to glam it up
MakeupAddiction,3e396x,petitekarma,8,Tue Jul 21 16:54:41 2015 UTC,Is he willing to leave something on overnight? Pure Lanolin has done wonders for me. It's basically nipple cream and you can get it from the baby section.

MakeupAddiction,3e396x,dinosaursandunicorns,4,Tue Jul 21 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Try changing your toothpaste to something with no SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) in it, it has done WONDERS for my lips. Sensodyne makes a lot without SLS just check the ingredients on the back, also if he uses mouthwash make sure that has no SLS in it too. Its a really common ingredient in most skin, hair, and tooth care products so it won't always be easy to find something without it but its a fairly common irritant for a lot of people.  He probably won't like the Agave lip mask as an overnight treatment because its really really thick but damn it does work. Like the other user suggested lanolin is the way to go (which the lip mask has that as an ingredient)."

MakeupAddiction,3e396x,hotteawhoney,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:23 2015 UTC,How about the texture of oil? Its slippery and no where near as sticky as lip balm. When my lips are feeling super dry I dab on some jojoba oil at night and they're much better in the morning.
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,tresliso,19,Mon Jul 20 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"I wish they had this tiny size as a permanent item. As well as foundations, I wish they had half size bottles.

MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,bryannanoel_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:13 2015 UTC,I know right! So glad I grabbed it in time!
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,foundinwonderland,9,Tue Jul 21 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"Bahhhhh it's so cute.  I have absolutely no need to buy anything from Sephora right now, but ugh I am such a sucker for tiny cute things.  And that little sample will probably still last you forever."
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,milklizard01,8,Mon Jul 20 23:30:44 2015 UTC,that little sample will probably still last you forever   Yep! TBH I didn't really need to place an order either. But between the new KVD lipsticks and this code...I succumbed.

MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,voyageofthemuntjac,2,Tue Jul 21 03:25:43 2015 UTC,I did the exact same thing--got KVD in Double Dare and the pressed in Opal!
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,NY1227,5,Tue Jul 21 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"I just got my sample but in pressed today. Can we talk about not only the tiny adorable mirror, but how amazing it would be if these were permanent things? Because like 50% of my justification for ordering something was for this sample. I've been eyeing the full size, but I don't highlight enough to justify the $40 or however much the full size costs. Plus it's so pigmented I doubt I'll ever hit the pan on the sample."
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,sraydenk,3,Tue Jul 21 02:53:48 2015 UTC,Exactly! I actually have a couple of the pressed ones in full size and they're enormous -- I don't think I could possibly use them up before they expire!
MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,dreamstorming,2,Tue Jul 21 02:59:33 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh I can't even imagine having more than one of the samples, let alone multiple full sizes! I would never use all of them, I'd finally be making a dent and high lighting would go out of style haha."

MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,yrcutebabe,2,Mon Jul 20 23:42:24 2015 UTC,It's still there. I just placed an order and was able to use the promo.

MakeupAddiction,3e07hd,bchmgal,3,Mon Jul 20 23:16:52 2015 UTC,I want to make a purchase on Sephora just to get this sample since it's been so hyped and I've been looking for a good highlighter. The samples only show the liquid one though... :(

MakeupAddiction,3dzzfs,salmoxis,3,Mon Jul 20 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"I think your curls are gorgeous and you have amazing lashes!   As for CC, your brows seem too thin for your face. Growing them out is a personal choice, but it would make a huge difference. Also, because most of your makeup is fairly minimal, I think you could get away with a darker lip color. That lip crayon is washing your face out."

MakeupAddiction,3e3lce,kapocsszem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:21 2015 UTC,"The best shade match I've found so far for my fair, neutral skin is L'Oreal True Match in N1."
MakeupAddiction,3e3lce,hosssauce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I really loved the Cover FX custom cover drops in N10! I mix them with white sunscreen or my MAC Face and Body in White and it really lightens the drops and creates a super fair foundation! You can also mix them with primers/ oils/ other foundations to change the tone/consistency. It's pricey, but waaaay worth it considering each time you use them, you don't need more than 2-4 drops!"
MakeupAddiction,3e3jlc,diegoldenenjude,2,Tue Jul 21 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"Apparently dip brow is better for those with sparse brows, and is not needed for those with naturally fuller brows. Powder is what I use for the tails, brush out with spoolie. Eyebrow pens could always work to draw in individual hairs. Using a lighter shade might help too."
MakeupAddiction,3e3jlc,AyKayKay,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:26 2015 UTC,A step more natural than Dipbrow is Aqua Brow from MUFE. It's thinner and easier to apply lightly IMO.

I usually use Ardell Wispies, but lately whatever glue I bought last (I forgot, I think it's some Revlon one) has been leaving this nasty residue on my lashes after I take the falsies off and it won't come off unless I sit there and physically pick at my lashes :(, so I've been avoiding that like the plague until I pick up a new one.   I also got this new mascara from NYX that I tried out with this look and it almost ruined it. I'm returning it SO FAST. It was clumpy and like soaking and GOT ON MY EYE (even tho I covered it). It was terrible, so never again. I don't doubt that my lashes were looking a bit rough, haha.   But thank you so much for your suggestion!"

MakeupAddiction,3dyajk,femputer1,-21,Tue Jul 21 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"I, personally, just took it as a rude thing to say to someone, especially after I didn't reply in a nasty way.

It should be about the makeup, not something brief said in the comments between two people."

Other people in this thread have given CC and I've had absolutely no issue with that. It's just the way things were said and then, per usual reddit fashion, things got blown way out of proportion.

MakeupAddiction,3dzwoq,elfies_,5,Mon Jul 20 21:54:44 2015 UTC,Skin looks lovely! My cc would be maybe to focus a little on the brows. They look a little sparse in the photos and the obvious difference between your hair colour and natural brow colour is a little odd as well. Have you considered or tried using a tuned brow gel?
MakeupAddiction,3dzwoq,beckelle,4,Tue Jul 21 03:48:18 2015 UTC,"I have felt this struggle because I am also Asian with hair dyed a similar color. Might I suggest the ABH Brow Wiz in a warmer brown? That really helped me! (Although I'm currently using a Brow Wiz dupe, Maybelline's Define-a-Brow.)"

MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,PhyrraNyx,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:58 2015 UTC,Pretty! Does anyone know how Iggy compares to Dragon from Vice3? I'm already looking for a dupe of that beautiful color because I've found a half dozen applications for it.
MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,fairydustandunicorns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry off topic, but how do you like  vice3? I want to  get it,  but  I've  heard  it's  fallout crazy."
MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,AmandaJoye,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but although some of the colors are pigmented and buttery, about half (mainly the sparkling neutrals) are chalky and have major fallout.  I like the bright colors in the pallette, but if I want to add a neutral to my look with a vice 3 color I just get out my naked pallette.  Hopefully that makes sense, I can't remember the colors off the top of my head and I'm not home right now to check."

MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,lacielaplante,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:31 2015 UTC,Danzig is disappointing to me.
MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,5upern0v4,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"Really? That's the one that convinced me to buy it. When I was at Sephora inside JCP, the MUA swatched it over her black tattoo and it covered it without primer. I always wear eyeshadow with primer because I have oily hooded lids. In the bare skin swatch, you can still see some of the blue sparkles, but on the black eyeliner it comes to life :)"
MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,Springshope,3,Mon Jul 20 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"I swatched it on my hand twice and it was definitely the least pigmented of all the line. I was super excited to buy it but I decided to pass in the end due to how poorly it was swatching with a finger. Clearly needed a sticky base to preform. Could be a shade that benefits more from a brush but I was comparing it to a MUFE purple I want, and the MUFE shadow wins."
MakeupAddiction,3dz46o,jortscore,2,Mon Jul 20 20:15:11 2015 UTC,Now I'm wondering if there's a consistency issue. For me the green Iggy was less pigmented than Danzig.

MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,woooooosha,4,Tue Jul 21 13:01:31 2015 UTC,"You might be using too much primer. As for blending, put down a skin tone shadow all over your lid, and blending will be way easier"
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,CorvusCorset,2,Tue Jul 21 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I only use a teeny tiny amount! The issue only gets worse if I over-apply. I use a base color as well, usually something like UD's Foxy. What tends to happen is that I apply and the color just STAYS where it's placed, and won't budge at all, almost like the primer is sucking the color into my skin instead of letting it rest on top. It's so frustrating!!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,marathon_girl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:23 2015 UTC,might be silly... but are you using the right brushes? a nice fluffy blending brush? I used to think that when blending you really had to push on the brush.. like apply a good amount of pressure against your lid.  and my lid would flap all around like a wrinkly old lady lid lol... i've just recently grasped the concept of light air strokes to blend.
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,marathon_girl,2,Tue Jul 21 14:17:48 2015 UTC,"I have a good set of brushes, and pressure doesn't seem to matter - if I tap off excess and go very lightly, it's almost like the primer is acting like a magnet and just sucks the color right off the brush! Once it's there, it won't move until I take it off with a wipe / remover. Particularly the WnW one, omg. And it's sooo hard to get off of my skin later. Most primer formulas I've found tend to be like this, and it makes my eyelids feel like the soul was ripped from them by a dementor, lol"
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,gwmakeup,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"that's very odd.  i'm out of suggestions :( i have super oily lids to begin with, so WnW is a godsend. it makes my lids ""normal"" but is indeed a bitch to get off - i have to use a good amount of baby oil for it not to be painful.    but it sounds like your lids are normal to begin with.  i hope someone can suggest an alternative for you!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,kardashianishobbit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:46:20 2015 UTC,"I agree Mac Paint Pots maybe the way to go. However, I really like the Benefit Stay Don't Stray Eyeshadow and Concealor primer. It gives smooth finish but doesn't leave the eyelids feeling dry or oily. It also comes in different skin shades light/medium/dark so will help even out any skin tone issues around the eyes too. It makes eyeshadows and concealor last all day, I use it on all my brides and I swear by it."
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,carnageincminor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:10 2015 UTC,Something that helps me is to use a base shadow color all over my lid after primer. Be careful of over blending the rest of your colors or else it can look muddy
MakeupAddiction,3e2f8i,AshKinsSmashKins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"If the primers are too drying for you, would an eyeshadow base work? Like Mac Paint Pots, Maybelline Color Tattoos, and other longwearing cream eyeshadows. For people with oily eyelids, eyeshadow base alone can still result in creasing and smearing, but if your eyelids are dry, maybe it's enough?"
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,lolafiretruck,9,Tue Jul 21 12:35:13 2015 UTC,Have you been to /r/beautyboxes?  They'll have lots of info and advice!
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,sea-weed,5,Tue Jul 21 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"I think if you want to build your make up collection or just try out products that you may not have thought to try yourself, it might be worth it. However, I unsubscribed after about 6 months after realizing that everything I don't use in my collection came from my Ipsy box. At the end of the 6 months, I really wishes I had instead saved $60 to get something I really loved."
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,captainmaomao,2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:50 2015 UTC,I have never subscribed to a beauty box service and this is the exact reason why. I saw everyone talking about not being happy and I decided I could just take what I would pay for the subscription and get something that I know I want.
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,Nighthuntress2015,5,Tue Jul 21 13:05:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I seem to be in the minority here, but I quite like my Ipsy subscription. It depends on your taste though. It's almost exclusively drugstore quality products with Mid-range price tags, so I almost never actually repurchase anything they send me. However, there will usually be one mid end item that makes the entire $10 bag worth it in my opinion. This month I got a tarte bronzer (which I'd previously been intrigued by but reluctant to drop $30 on) and last month I got smashbox primer (felt the same as with the tarte bronzer!)    I would say as a general rule of thumb that ipsy is best if you are used to drugstore level makeup or if you are a beginner. I wouldn't classify myself as a beginner, but my collection is 90% drugstore because I don't have a large budget for makeup.   One other important thing to note is that ipsy is pretty terrible at adhering to your beauty quiz. You could blatantly say that you don't want any of x but they will probably still send it to you at some point. This includes things like skin tone. If you have a particularly unique or uncommon skintone/undertone, ipsy might not be worth it because they pretty much exclusively have things for medium light -> olive skin tones and that's about it. Also might not be worth it if you are quite picky about what kind of products you like, because you probably won't get what you specify for.   All that said, I typically use up 4 out of the 5 items that I receive each month and the value is phenomenal if you do actually use the products. This month, the retail value of my bag was ~$70, and I only paid $10 for it. However, if 3/5 of the items get left sitting in a vanity somewhere, you are much better off saving up for things you really like.   Sorry for the length of this. Hope that helped!"
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,TheBexB,5,Tue Jul 21 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"Not worth it to me. The products are often repeats of pretty low-quality brands, you get a lot of the same stuff recycled over and over again, and even the good stuff, I find, tends to just kind of hoard up in a drawer somewhere. I'd recommend something like BoxyCharm over Ipsy, where you get full sized products every month."
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,stumblepretty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:29 2015 UTC,So I have one and I'm really on the fence about keeping it. I've gotten a couple OK things but I've gotten at least 1 horrible thing in every bag. I much prefer my Birchbox subscription.
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,HandTurkeyz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"I subscribed to Ipsy and got my first bag in March. At that time, I knew almost nothing about makeup. Since that time, I've learned a lot and have tried a lot of different products. Usually, there's at least one thing that I really love from each bag. To me, it's worth it because I like the anticipation of having something delivered and I like that it gives me a variety of products to try out. Plus, I now have sample sizes of a lot of products that I can use when I travel (like Smashbox primer that I got last month). Both my roommate and I are both subscribers, so we swap items around sometimes."
MakeupAddiction,3e2cm7,Java_The_Cup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:41 2015 UTC,"I just got my first ipsy bag in the mail! Personally, I think it's worth it because I get to try brands and products that I would never purchase on my own. I love that you get a free makeup bag out of it, and you can always regift the things you get that you don't see yourself using."

MakeupAddiction,3e304t,milklizard01,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:47 2015 UTC,I put my most used ones together and then sort by brand within them... sometimes I switch placements around with season since I prefer certain formulas and/or colors at different times of year.
MakeupAddiction,3e304t,bewareofunicorn,3,Tue Jul 21 16:12:30 2015 UTC,"I have 2 lipstick organizers. One has lipsticks that I don't use very often, and the other has the ones I'm a lot more likely to use. I have them organized by brand, then by colour. Nudes on the left, then gradually moving up towards the darkest on the right."
MakeupAddiction,3e304t,erifuka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:41 2015 UTC,"I sort by color within a certain formula or finish (e.g., matte plums, matte reds, sheer pinks, etc.)."
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,BookerDeWittsCarbine,20,Tue Jul 21 01:05:38 2015 UTC,It seems possible that some kind of beauty or makeup company or organization sold your information. This happens a lot.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,marashade,7,Tue Jul 21 01:46:55 2015 UTC,This is possible. Watch you bank account because they will sometimes give you a free subscription to something then charge you for an automatic renewal.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,dangerstar19,9,Tue Jul 21 04:36:11 2015 UTC,That is so shady.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,abbeyrogue,7,Tue Jul 21 05:30:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, happened to a woman on here. She bought some elf stuff then started getting a magazine subscription. Didn't think anything of it until the renewed the subscription. She called to ask what was up and they said the initial subscription was sent by ELF."
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,dangerstar19,13,Tue Jul 21 05:35:41 2015 UTC,"For future reference, when you check out from elf, there's something on the right hand side in your cart about a magazine. You're supposed to click the box if you DON'T want a subscription. Otherwise, they sign you up. :/"
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,karlayst,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:21 2015 UTC,"Oh crap, I've never seen that before."
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,dangerstar19,4,Tue Jul 21 12:01:02 2015 UTC,Sounds super convenient and nice of random companies!   Not.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,abbeyrogue,3,Tue Jul 21 06:50:02 2015 UTC,This is good to know...I ordered from elf last month and just got a magazine in the mail that I never ordered. I'll have to keep an eye on that.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,youngandstarving,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:39:06 2015 UTC,They did that to me. I couldn't figure out why I was getting Essence magazine until I read this subreddit and remembered I had recently ordered from ELF.
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,ellipsis333,5,Tue Jul 21 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"I've gotten random packages from companies before for no apparent reason. Always related to things i've ordered in the past but not from companies I have experience with. I get UD sachets a couple times a year even though i've never ordered from them (assuming this is ultas doing?)  Pretty much any time you sign up for anything they could potentially sell that information, which is why i'm hesitant about signing up for any ""Free rewards card!"" which requires an address. That's probably what happened to you. Or if you subscribe to any beauty boxes maybe it's coming from one of their partners as a birthday gift? That seems like something they would do."
MakeupAddiction,3e0l7p,anamperstand,3,Tue Jul 21 03:20:07 2015 UTC,"There were some people on Makeupalley.com that got this same package. Maybe it's from ULTA?   I recently got a random box of Sephora X polishes, I am assuming from Sephora. Sometimes companies just want to send a treat (and get you hooked on their product, of course!)."

MakeupAddiction,3e1z34,iwannarooyou,3,Tue Jul 21 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"Have you been checking whether your foundations and primers are compatible?  Looking at the ingredients to see whether they're water, oil, or silicone based is always a good idea.   Tools can also make a big difference.  I've found that applying and blending foundation with a damp Beautyblender or Real Techniques sponge gives a smoother finish.   Lastly I suggest checking out /r/skincareaddiction if you haven't already been over there.  There's lots of great info and advice for getting skin in great condition."
MakeupAddiction,3e1z34,sea-weed,2,Tue Jul 21 09:52:34 2015 UTC,I agree with this. Using a damp Beauty Blender will also not agitate flaky patches because you're tapping the makeup over them rather than rubbing it across them. I have really dry skin too and after I switched to using a BB my makeup looked 10x better.
MakeupAddiction,3dznmf,psylentt,14,Mon Jul 20 20:47:57 2015 UTC,"This look is really nice, lots of contrast! I know you already mentioned you didn't have time to fix the lashes but maybe just combing through with a metal lash comb? I think that, with a thin liner, would make this perfect!"

MakeupAddiction,3dznmf,PERNICIOUSPIE,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:46 2015 UTC,"I love this look! The outer portion of your eye reminds me of a galaxy and I'm really loving the color combination.  To address the eyelashes, I've found that with the super clumpy formulas (looking at you, Benefit!) I have less luck with the eyelash comb and more luck with a stiff eyebrow spoolie. I don't let the mascara completely dry, but I definitely wait until it's not wet enough to stick to the spoolie. I put the spoolie at the base and then wiggle it up through my lashes a few times, until I've got them separated enough for my tastes. I've also found that going through with a spoolie will keep my mascara from tracking under my eye later on."
MakeupAddiction,3dznmf,moxiecontin714,3,Tue Jul 21 05:47:10 2015 UTC,I like to use a little bit of Clump Crusher as an eyelash primer! Some people say they do a coat after applying their other mascara too.

However, from your pictures, you look best when you show off your lashes--they look great! Try emphasizing a couple of your features at a time to start out with. For example, a mostly simple face but with lots of mascara and a bright lip, or a dramatic eye and defined brows with a subtle lip color, or bold eyeliner with not much eyeshadow but with defined brows or bold lips.  I don't really follow suggestions about what colors match/emphasize my coloring with my clothing, plus green eyes are my favorite, so I think yours would look good with almost any color really! On the lids, shimmery champagne, gold, bronze, or copper are neutral in the sense that they'll usually go with anything else you're doing with your makeup/clothing. Btw you can cheat slightly fuller lips with a lip pencil.  I'm not sure this is what you're looking for, but I find that perfecting my skin and brows always makes me look more polished. I suggest looking into brow shaping, a brow product, and a highlighter. Brows do a lot to frame your eyes and face. I notice you have some natural flush to your complexion so you can get away with not wearing blush of you don't feel like it, but a highlight is nice for bringing additional luminosity to your skin."
MakeupAddiction,3e18f3,OuO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:34 2015 UTC,"Whoa, thanks for this comment! You lost me in a few places, as I'm not really sure how to highlight features. I don't really know products, or really how to do much of anything with makeup. do you know of any good tutorials?"
MakeupAddiction,3e18f3,OuO,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:41 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to what I said about highlighters? Generally speaking, they're a type of product that is lighter in tone than your skin, and it reflects light off the high points of your face, particularly the tops of your cheekbones but you can also use on your browbone, nose bridge, cupid's bow, and chin. Most are shimmery but some matte. I think some of the lighter Maybelline mosaic-looking blushes are used as highlighters, L'Oreal has some new ones, and Physician's Formula have some too.  For tutorials, Lisa Eldridge's YouTube channel is awesome for really diverse tutorials, from makeup basics to dramatic looks. She's a professional makeup artist so some of the products she uses are hard to find/expensive, but you can always use an alternative. Hope this helps!"

I don't really touch my eyebrows, I pluck them a bit but not a ton. I'm really not sure where to start with new products,especially because I don't even know how to use a lot of them.   I'll definateoy check out her channel, thank you!"

MakeupAddiction,3e1u7q,covert_cakes,5,Tue Jul 21 08:40:54 2015 UTC,"Looks like a neutral to warm olive tone to me.   A few recommendations:   Blush:  Tarte Exposed, Laura Mercier Tender Mauve, Elf Mellow Mauve, MAC Cubic, Benefit Dallas  Lipsticks:  MAC Brick-o-la, MAC Faux, MAC Kinda Sexy, Bite Glace, Bite Musk Bronzer:  Too Faced Milk Chocolate Soleil, Benefit Hoola    I also think MAC Teddy eyeliner would be wonderful with your eye colour!"
MakeupAddiction,3e1u7q,sea-weed,3,Tue Jul 21 11:40:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestions!! Those mostly look like the shades I am drawn to. Especially the Benefit Dallas for the blushes.  I've noticed that there are certain colors that I hate on myself, and I'm wondering if that is because (assuming your warm olive diagnosis is correct) my skin tone clashes with cool tones? Or..with tones that don't go with olive skin in general (whatever those are).   Since I feel like I'd like the Benefit Dallas, is there a shade of Benefit blush of the same make that I should definitely stay away from? I ask because I want to be sure my natural inclinations are not just delusions.. and that the lady that sold me my current blush was out of her mind. It's a cool shimmery pink.  edit: sorry, you said neutral to warm olive. I overlooked that."
MakeupAddiction,3e1u7q,sea-weed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think muted mauves, roses, and berries would suit you, both for blush and lipsticks.  That's not to say you wouldn't be able to pull off a really cool toned pink but it'd be more of a statement look if that makes sense?   Low contrast shades will be really flattering on you in general but I can also see you in dark vampy lip colours and warm brights.   If you're not keen on the cooler pink blushes I'd avoid Benefit Hervana."
MakeupAddiction,3e1u7q,eightcharm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:47 2015 UTC,"Ok thank you! I think you're right about the vampy tones as well.  And yeah I definitely just don't like the look of cool pinks on me. I think coral colors might be considered flattering on my skin tone (..?) as well, but I hate those more than the cool pink haha. Personal preference and what we're used to seeing in the mirror, I guess.  Maybe you hit on something with suggesting ""muted"" tones though. The idea of like bright bubblegum shades or bright corals on me is clownish in my mind."

MakeupAddiction,3dz0y9,spookybun,7,Mon Jul 20 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to make yr face look rounder and wider, you can essentially reverse contour - use a lighter shade in the hollows of yr cheeks! I wouldn't go shimmery, though, and I wouldn't necessarily use a darker color in the normal highlight points - just use a slightly lighter foundation or concealer shade in the areas you don't want to recede as much."

The brush-like tip is very fine, making it appropriate, slightly hooded, asian eyes. A little more pressure will yield a thicker line if you need it. I've had it for 7 months now and shows no signs of drying out; granted, I don't use it everyday. It also has great longevity in the Philippine heat and humidity. This product can only be found in the Asian region, I believe. However, there may be an analogous product from Maybelline or other brands from the same owner."

That plus the setting spray you already use helps. And during the day I blot with the beautyblender blotteratti sponge thing. I posted a link but I guess they thought I owned the company or something and deleted it as self promotion. Anyway, the DW foundation, powder and blotter sponge have helped tremendously."
MakeupAddiction,3e0qhd,freakngeek13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:46 2015 UTC,"I would try to use items that describe themselves as long wearing if that is the issue you are having, especially foundation and primer.

MakeupAddiction,3e0n9k,suishu,7,Tue Jul 21 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"Cost wise, I know they aren't the most cost efficient option out there, but I LOVE the new ones from Buxom. The quality of the shadows is just incredible. It's $40 for the palette and six single shadows, so if you don't count the cost of the palette, it's like $6.67 per pan. They have gorgeous neutrals but there are also some really beautiful fun colors in the line as well."
MakeupAddiction,3e0n9k,bryannanoel_,6,Tue Jul 21 01:50:55 2015 UTC,You can try the Inglot Freedom palettes!
MakeupAddiction,3e0n9k,chief_kweef,5,Tue Jul 21 01:24:21 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Inglot freedom palette. I think you get more bang for your buck with these because they're good quality and have more product than most single shadows available (something like 2.3g!). You can also combine them and have an eye and cheek palette, eye and face, etc."

MakeupAddiction,3e0n9k,odalisques,2,Tue Jul 21 05:17:02 2015 UTC,"Urban Decay's build your own palette system can be pricey, but it's not too hard to build up a collection. Between Ulta coupons and points, online sales, and keeping a careful eye out on /r/makeupexchange, I've never had to pay full price for an eyeshadow single, and the range of colors that they have out is really great. Plus, it's not difficult to find an empty interchangeable palette on MUE or ebay for less than the price in-store ($10).  I'm also in love with Makeup Forever's singles. Again, pricey, and less easy to come by discounts for them than UD, but the formula is absolutely top notch, and their selection of colors and finishes is incredible. My favorite thing about their range is that an empty one, two, or three pan case is only $1! Really helps to offset the cost of the shadows themselves. You could also put them in a z-palette if you're looking to build a larger palette.  Last suggestion is to look into indie eyeshadow brands, and DIY a palette. You can get very generous loose powder eyeshadow samples for really cheap from most indie brands, and then buy an empty palette off amazon or ebay. There are a bunch of tutorials on youtube on how to press loose powders, and it's really simple and can be a fun weekend craft. Plus most indie brands have great ranges of colors, and are really cost effective. /r/indiemakeupandmore is a great resource if you want to learn more about indie brands!"

It looks to me like once I depot the eyeshadow it should just magnetize to the bottom of the palette, but all my eyeshadows are round and I feel like the space between them is going to annoy me to no end. I see that they sell empty square metal pans but repressing powder sounds like a huge hassle."

MakeupAddiction,3dyhcx,darlingdeer9,4,Mon Jul 20 17:01:55 2015 UTC,I am currently going through a very similar experience. I placed my order on June 26th. I waited to email them after their 3-5 estimated business days. I ended up emailing them on July 12th and they just repeated the stuff about their TAT and gave me $5 glambucks. I checked the shipping information again and it's still just a label created.  I won't be buying from them again. As much as they seemed to be hyped up on youtube their customer service is terrible. I also sold some stuff to them and it took weeks for them to create a shipping label. They didn't even know which brands they were accepting when it got to the point of actually buying my makeup.
MakeupAddiction,3dyhcx,yrcutebabe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the warning! I've purchased from them (only when they run good % off deals as I find their normal prices aren't really that good a deal) but never sold there. I'm working on a destash pile now though and was trying to figure out where to sell it all... will definitely steer clear of them!
MakeupAddiction,3dyhcx,beglitteredgeek,2,Mon Jul 20 18:19:54 2015 UTC,I have requested a shipping label from them 3 times AND spoken to customer service and still don't have it.
MakeupAddiction,3dyhcx,InimitableMissS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:51 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. I kind of thought I was missing out by not selling there but reading this and hearing other negative reviews (people sending hundreds of dollars of makeup only to get like $50 back if even) confirms I'm not missing anything. I sell on MUE with no issues and feel better knowing it's going to people in our community of MUAs who appreciate the makeup (I know I know I'm very protective of my stuff haha). There was only one person recently who tried selling a MAC G.V. LE lipstick for double the price-nobody was having that but at least they weren't fake as far as I know. They're in stock on Macs website anyways.  [Edit] Haven't heard of this Mercari app. Will be avoiding like the plague!!! Thank youuu

The tracking said that they hadn't even picked it up. When I emailed them they we just unhelpful and basically just said that they hadn't received anything. Didn't make any effort to go to the post office and check at all! Finally after about 9 weeks of waiting they finally sent me an offer for a measly 80 bucks. I sent them way for than 80 bucks worth of makeup. Really disappointed with glambot after I had heard all the hype and great reviews from some people. I plan on ordering from them, to see how that works out. But I will not be selling to them again."

Buy at your own risk, of course, I genreally trust /r/makeupexchange more because it's usually people in our little online community here, but I've gotten some good stuff from people using the app, just make sure you ask fro pictures or verify that something is not a fake, and you have to approve the item once you receive it, and if there is something wrong you can request a refund and give the seller a bad review."
MakeupAddiction,3dyhcx,mystery_bitch,4,Mon Jul 20 20:29:22 2015 UTC,"NOOOOOOO. I used to love Mercari when it first started but now it's the worst! I had Mercari cancel a DELIVERED item I sent because the buyer didn't pay attention to the description when purchasing so she filed a claim. I told her I would refund her once she sent my stuff back but she never sent it and Mercari still cancelled it. So now she's got my stuff and the money back.  Customer service is horrible I bought an item that a seller never shipped and had to wait THREE MONTHS for them to give my money back. I contacted Mercari twice about it and they never sent me a reply. The third time I messaged them, I wasn't nice at all and they finally replied.  My last purchases on there were bnib all 3 Naked palettes and a chocolate bar palette (all from one seller), and a bnib Lorac Mega Pro (from a different seller). Both sellers guaranteed authenticity of these and when I received them EVERY SINGLE ONE was fake. Mercari had permanently deleted my account because I had a bank inquiry on my card (which was a mistake and I later cancelled) so instead of giving me a chance to explain the situation, they deleted all of my items, released my funds to both sellers of the fake palettes, then kicked me off and I can no longer log in at all. They store your phones info so you can't make a new account.   Nothing but scammers and horrid customer service!!!"

MakeupAddiction,3e09wp,etiquetteyouidiot,3,Tue Jul 21 02:36:25 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Estee Lauder Doublewear? It's definitely long lasting, and I find it does decently well on my dry skin. I wouldn't necessarily say it is hydrating or anything like that, but I find that as long as my skin is hydrated and well moisturized it wears well and doesn't dry my skin further. I've also had luck mixing it with a drop of jojoba oil or serum (I use Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair) to give it a slightly sheer, more glow-y finish. It might be worth getting a sample to try out and see if it works for you. (Just remember to apply in sections because it dries fast and can get streaky when applied incorrectly.)"
MakeupAddiction,3e09wp,cephalopodie,2,Tue Jul 21 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"Second this. Double wear applied with a beauty blender is the best foundation for me ever and I've tried nearly everything.

MakeupAddiction,3e0y79,eatgeeksleeprepeat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:25:27 2015 UTC,Definitely! Pink undertones can often appear to make a foundation darker as opposed to a yellow undertone with the same colour depth. :)

I never thought to do something like that when my hair was purple, because I prefer more natural. I love the pop of color that it gives your face and how you keep everything else pretty minimal.  My only real CC is that, if it were me, I would go heavier on the blush, or maybe just use a bit of a darker shade. I also sport super pale skin and my HG blush is Desert Rose by MAC. Don't have to use much product at all with this shade, either. Even when I think I want to broaden my horizons and try something new, I always come crawling back to this shade.  Hope your day is great!  Edit: Just dawned on me that a side by side swatch comparison for the blush you used and the one I'm suggesting might be helpful. Doh!"

First of get a nice eyeliner and learn how to tightline, just add some mascara and this will be enough for a natural look. You do have a lovely eye color and some brown eyeshadow would really help them pop.  There are tons of great tutorials in the sidebar, but I know that the thing that helped me up my game the most has been looking at all the looks users post on here. Reading the comments especially helps you learn how to think about makeup."

I shaped my brows, they never look right to me.  My skin is oily, the photoready primer seems to help the shine. Also I always wear glasses (fun times!)  Other than that, I'm kinda at a loss."
MakeupAddiction,3dz7bk,mandarin_duckling,4,Mon Jul 20 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"Fellow newbie and glasses wearer here! I think you're off to a good start! When you wear glasses, tightline and mascara can go a loong way. Add cream shadow all over lid as an experiment, like maybelline color tattoo. I can not do eyeliner, but I learned how to tightline and it's easier.  I really like too faced 3 way lash lining tool for that, it makes it really easy!   Concealer can be tough if you're like me, I find it really hard to blend concealer without it looking cakey or patchy. So my solution is to choose a medium coverage foundation so that it covers most of my skin problems. Also as you have pretty well defined lips already, lip liner may not be necessary."

If you're willing to drop some cash, Urban Decay has awesome palettes. You could always go into a Sephora or Ulta and ask what they'd think would be the best palette for you.   Currently, I'm using Urban Decay's perversion mascara. Before, I was using a Covergirl mascara that wasn't bad and significantly cheaper. I have Stila liner I really like."
MakeupAddiction,3dz7bk,lolacalifornia,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:26 2015 UTC,"Piggybacking the brown shadow suggestion, I recommend maybelline color tattoos, specifically bad to the bronze. It stays put and it's dark enough to be noticeable but light enough that it's not hard to blend it and I do it with my finger. Put that all over the lid and blend up just over your browbone so you can still see it eyes open, and out the side a little bit. It can also be used as primer for another color or powders later down the line. I use that one on its own most of the time for work, it's really flattering for blue eyes (as is purple but that might be a little much at this point )."

I had to read what it means to tightline your eyes lol, but I actually do something similar. I wiggle my mascara brush at the base of my lashes, and it creates definition like you would get from using eye liner or a pencil. For mascara I would seriously suggest you try out Urban Decay Perversion. That can be a bit pricey for some, so if it is my second recommendation is Palladio Maxx Length Mascara (sold at Sally beauty). It actually helped my lashes grow longer.   I would do something light like a primer and powder foundation for your skin because you actually have really nice skin. I find the pimer & powder combo is enough to cover my minor flaws.   Lastly, if you're not happy with your brows, try going to a professional to get their opinion/help. I used to have similar brows, but found my eyes looked much better when I created more of an arch.   Good Luck! there really is so much to learn. <3"

MakeupAddiction,3e0wpm,aquasponge,9,Tue Jul 21 02:39:55 2015 UTC,I think your brows look great! Can you elaborate on what you're asking for help with?
MakeupAddiction,3e0wpm,mags_bennett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just feel like the arch is really weak but I don't know how to make it stronger and more emphasized. Also, are the beginnings too squared?"
MakeupAddiction,3e0wpm,mags_bennett,5,Tue Jul 21 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say without a full face pic, but I think the arch you've been able to create is very flattering! I think that a more severe arch might not suit you as well.  As for the squared inner corner - I think the bottom row is a little square, but not so much so that it looks obviously drawn on, so it's up to you whether it's your aesthetic or not! The middle row and the top right photos look A+ to me."
