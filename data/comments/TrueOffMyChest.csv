TrueOffMyChest,3e2jcq,graywolf0026,4,Tue Jul 21 19:53:23 2015 UTC,"That's a bunch of bullshit on their end.  They have your phone numbers, email addresses, and actual address.  Instead they let snail mail deliver that important information??  I know once my payment was late, it was my bad, I totally forgot the date and sent it out late.  They called me the next morning to ask where it was, so I could avoid late fees.  Then called me back after lunch to say they received the payment.  Sounds like the leasing office dropped the ball, too."
TrueOffMyChest,3e2jcq,Ethanol_Based_Life,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight. No notice was posted on your door, you received no certified letter, no one tried to contact you? As a former property manager who's had to evict people, I can tell you right now, this thing stinks.  First of all, even if they FILE an eviction against you in court, they still have to show that they attempted to serve you notice according to state/county/local laws. In most cases, a certified letter is the primary method of proving this (since posting the notice and direct service can often be disputed).  Second, even then if they had successfully filed and shown cause, it's not automatic that you are evicted. Most courts will have the parties go into mediation to try and resolve any potential issues due to the eviction. In the case of non-payment, this step is generally avoided since... The reason is simple. So in that case it goes to court. This process (in California at least, where I managed), that can be anywhere from 2-3 weeks from the notice of service. The court has to have time to certify that you have been served notice to appear.  Once in court, burden of proof falls to the landlord. And say you had been found in default of payment of rent. Well, they still have to post notice OF your eviction on the place of residence, stating the final date that you will be locked out. This is usually handled by the local sheriff's office or other law enforcement. This can be anywhere from 2-3 weeks out, again. At which point you are removed from the property, it posted sealed, no trespassing, and you are thereby evicted. Also to keep in mind, once the court rules against you and states your eviction, that goes on your record.  Most states, California as an example, requires the land lord MUST hold onto your property for a term of no less than 45 days, at which they can sell it for auction or simply trash it. During that time, if you are able to pay the price of your past rent plus any storage fee's incurred by the landlord (And all must be verified on their end via receipt), then your property is released, and off you go.  So realistically, what are we looking at? Overall, it takes about 30-45 days to LEGALLY evict someone from a rental property. In some states (California, example again) they allow for shorter notices, in this case a 3 day notice to make payment or quit the lease. Then the eviction process starts. It does not mean, that if served by notice to evict the property, you are required to leave at that time, nor does it go on your record. Only after it proceeds through the court does it appear on your record and you must be out at the specified time.  What you should do, google the local website for the Code Enforcement office or Housing Department in your area, and look up ""Your Rights and Responsibilities as a tenant"".  I would always, always, ALWAYS recommend this to new incoming tenants (ESPECIALLY FIRST TIME RENTERS), so that way they were fully aware, and had reference, to not only their rights, but listing out, word for word, what the landlord legally can and cannot do."

TrueOffMyChest,3e2jcq,slappymcnutface,2,Wed Jul 22 07:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you live at some big corporate-owned complex.   The laws that apply to landlord/tenant situations vary by state, but they all apply to your landlord as well.   Half of your rent was 20 days overdue - by accident. They have no grounds to file eviction proceedings on the 21st, especially if you still have a valid lease, and aren't a month-to-month tenant.   Plus, you always pay your rent on time. You missed half of it once. They don't want you to move, unless you're renting the apartment below market value or you're a nuisance.    They tell me that the management company was going to file eviction papers today at noon.   They can tell you that, but nobody was going to file eviction papers. Laws vary by state, like I said, but in no state would a landlord have grounds to file a possession claim on the 21st of the month based solely on half the rent not being paid.   That was an empty threat.   Don't be so hard on yourself. Everyone has paid their rent late at some point or another. You're human. It happens.   Don't stress. No worries. :-)"
TrueOffMyChest,3e2jcq,baldylox,2,Wed Jul 22 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I'm talking about but every story of eviction I've ever heard has never happened over 7 days after payment was due. It usually takes months for the landlord to get pissed enough to actually evict you. They are people too. And they don't have to kick you out immediately unless they want to.   You're stressing over this a bit much. You would have been fine. ""starting the eviction process"" doesn't mean you're gone that afternoon haha nooo that takes a long time. You were fine.    Here's a good example of an evicted family. Frankly, they deserve it. You don't.

If you really want to have sex that badly, try hookup websites/apps.  There will ALWAYS be someone out there looking for a good time.  If you don't want a one night stand or fuck buddy have you tried actually taking the time to get to know someone before trying to have sex with them?  Don't bring up sex with a girl for at least a month or two.  Take the time to fall in love and/or find someone worthwhile and things will fall into place.  Just because you take care of yourself and have hobbies doesn't mean you're God's gift to women.  Thinking about/talking about/worshipping sex all of the time is very off putting and as a female, I would not be comfortable around you.  Also, have you considered talking to a therapist?

I think putting of those things for months when dating someone will make them think I wasn’t interested in them that way better to make your intentions known (in a respectful and not crazy way of course). I don’t think women mind sex early on in a relationship my best friend for example think that if you are waiting longer than the second date to have sex then something is a little off.  Fortunately I’m not interested in getting with you I literally know nothing about you but I understand what you are trying to get across.

Instead of focusing on scoring, try focusing on helping your 'date' relax into a mentally stimulating conversation that allows them to see you as a person of intrigue and with dimension.

I don't recognize myself. I'm a hard working person with a great work ethic. I started working as soon as I turned 14 and worked every summer and after school since then. There was a point where I actually had 3 different jobs at the same time while in going to high school. And now I do nothing all day. While I was in school, my mentality was that these jobs would be temporary. So I worked hard, made money, and was happy. But now that I'm done with school and the jobs I'm applying to are going to be full time and long term, it matters so much more what type of job I'm going to be doing and who I'll be working with.

I'm not sure about your situation but in my case I graduated from college last May, and after three months of job hunting. I left everything and everyone I knew for a small town in Louisiana, and it sucks. I have a very limited social life here (I'm active in two clubs outside of work, but I only have about five people I can actually call my friends here, and guess what, they're all outsiders too). Leaing all my friends in both my hometown and my college town, I became well acquainted with loneliness, put a shitty job on top of that and it can get really taxing on the mind.  On the bright side though I got to explore those hobbies and activities I would have never have delved into if it wasn't for the constant boredom and distaste to my job.   My biggest lesson I've learned: make your location or situation work for you. For example, since my social life isn't as active as it used to be I don't go out to bars or parties every weekend night like I used to, so that has allowed me to focus a lot on studying for this test. Without roommates my weeknights are a drag, so I got really into exercising because it helped pass the time, etc.  Find something to keep you sane and busy and gives you a sense of fulfillment. Trust me I really really fucking hate those eight hours a day I spend a work, but when I get home I put on my running gear, hit the pavement for about three to five miles, and when I come back things don't feel as shitty anymore because I accomplished something.  Alright I've rambled on a bit too much with my wall of text, but you have no idea how much relief it gave me to see somebody else who is currently hating their job as much as I do. All I work with are people who have been working at my company for like 20 years, they don't get how I feel. Feel free to share anything you want too, I feel like after having you read all of that I owe it to you to read your wall of text. lol"

TrueOffMyChest,3djkew,sosdsd,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Do something stupid, carefully.  Jim Butcher has stated that he was once a part of a community centered around The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and ""if you can build a community around that, you can build a community around anything.""  I was invited into the local ""rocky"" scene twice: once by a girl I pitied, and once by a woman I worshiped.  The first time, I refused to consort with such dorky fags (I've never had a problem with homosexuals, in theory, but the Rocky scene was populated by obnoxious flaming faggots and my 16yr-old self knew that wasn't ""cool"".  And I still thought I could be cool.  Then I had my life, being and soul turned inside-out by a love interest.  I hadn't even known that was possible.  My sexual orientation didn't change, but my perspective did.  It took an Internet friend to put it into words I could understand: ""Skin Hunger""  It's the urge to be touched, to be a part of a human thing and accepted.  Accepted, despite the bad choices you may have made in the past, despite the warnings your mom dispensed or the advice of your friends that you ignored or just didn't understand.  It's to be touched, and wanted by another human being, even if it doesn't involve physical touches.  To feel any sort of passion, to be motivated by anything other than practical needs and by pain.  I can tell by your words that you've been burned; you've been badly, badly burned.  You've learned to motor on; probably there were a few people in your life who helped you find an anchor when you'd been set adrift on the tides of life.  ""Be strong"", they said.  ""Look what's happening; be smart!""  But they couldn't fix you.  There's only so much advice they could give you before they could only sit back and hope.  At the end of the day, you can't pin your life on your friends.  You have to give your life over to people who make you feel something.  That's really, really, REALLY fucking hard, especially when your life lessons came late.  I can only say that most people were set on their life path earlier, and weren't adult enough to really consider the implications.  Stupid is as stupid does, and the world is full of stupid people.  Donald Trump is super-rich, sports a comb-over, and is laughed at by many, but so is everyone else.  Hugh Hefner is surrounded by big-tiddied fake blondes even though he's like 80 yrs old.  Both are considered huge successes in life.  Is that what you want?  The truth is, the world is full of all sorts of people, most of them desperate in one way or another.  What they really want is someone they can count on, someone who knows who they are and what they want.  Many people won't like your opinion.  Oh, but some will.  I don't know how to take that plunge.  Maybe I'm too old.  But you are obsessed with committing yourself to something that makes sense.  Love doesn't, and the last time you tried it it burned you.  That's not how it works.  You just have to tuck in and commit yourself to someone who seems pleasant enough, and hope.  That's life.  It's a bitch.  And then you die.  Isn't that just the kicker?  I'm not alone because I'm fat or an asshole, though I am both. I'm alone because I refuse to make myself vulnerable  to human beings ever again.  I just want a cat, now; the stupidity of cats is well known, accepted by society, and generally understood.  I'm not trying to elicit sympathy.  Consider this: human beings made a network of fiber-optic cables spanning all the world, all speaking the same computer language, so we can all communicate.  What do we do with this great invention?  Well, many spread hate.  But here in the ""Western"" world mostly we post pictures of babies, cats, puppies, and porn.  That is who we are.  You're no exception.  Would you want to be?"

I don't think so. 99 out of every 100 Christian people I ever met have been a part of a sexual relationship which goes against the Bible at some point in their life. And while others might briefly acknowledge it's bad, and certain ""baptisty"" sects really demonize it, it is NEVER put on the same level as homosexuality.  Not just sex either, there are dozens of sinful acts, all which are talked about in the Bible more than homosexuality, which the church stays quiet on, or might mention once in a long sermon, only to get the guns out for gay marriage.

TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,CarrotIronfounderson,2,Wed Jul 15 01:19:48 2015 UTC,"You're a little wrapped up in the religion. Pretty much every sect of Christianity is screwed up.

The origin of the cross actually comes from Babylon as a symbol of Tammuz, son of Semiramis (the queen of Babylon who diefied herself and her son). It's pagan. The temple of God is the human body. The church of God are the people who follow. There's no need for (and is actually sinful to have) an Earthly symbol.  The reason 'homosexuality' is so demonized is because it's pretty much active sin. Homosexuality itself isn't called out as sin (though Jesus states that holding lust in your heart, even if not acted upon, is a sin. Matthew 5:28) but homosexual acts themselves are the sin. Someone who engages in premarital sex is sinning just as much as someone having gay sex. However, any sin is forgiven through repentance.

TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,VectrosFuzion,0,Wed Jul 15 04:55:37 2015 UTC,Because it's the only right thing to do.
TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,ClassyJacket,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:46 2015 UTC,There is no objective  'right' or 'wrong'.  Get off your high horse and realize the world doesn't work that way.
TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,VectrosFuzion,0,Wed Jul 15 16:46:57 2015 UTC,"hey I think that is cool. I hope to see more Christians like you out there :)   The problem with people is that they tend to see one crazy guy aka terrorist bomber, than all of a sudden all middle eastern people are the enemy!!!   Unfortunately it is the same with Christians. The world sees the loud guy and then suddenly all Christians are assholes.   Every time one more of you stands up, you're helping. Usually it is the people who disagree who have the loudest voices but somewhere in the silence, masses slowly start changing their minds :)"

I know you said YOUR church doesn't do those things, but how would you feel if I insisted that MY sect of the KKK isn't racist?  Sorry but people's logic is correct here."
TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,ClassyJacket,0,Wed Jul 15 03:17:42 2015 UTC,"Atheism isn't ""Where you turn"", that's like saying being LGBT is a choice. Atheism is just the lack of faith in a god, and for most Atheists it's not even remotely a defining factor in their life.  And it's awesome you found a good church that does all that stuff, really it is. But it's very far from the norm. I come from a progressive area, in a progressive state, and have had unfettered, behind the scenes access to dozens of churches of different denominations (was a pastor's kid, and dad moved around a lot) and while I've known an amazing amount of really good people throughout the years, there has always been an overall taint on the congregation about certain hot topic issues. Gay marriage especially.  I once saw a dog which could run around on its hind legs all day, they exist. But if that owner said ""quit saying dogs don't walk on hind legs most of the time, because MINE DOES."" Then, they'd probably be called out on what they're saying. Your situation is not common. But I'm glad you've found it."
TrueOffMyChest,3dagrp,CarrotIronfounderson,0,Wed Jul 15 16:50:23 2015 UTC,"Gay and Christian?  Why not?  Pretty much every sect of Christianity is screwed up. The image of the cross is itself a sin since it's a form of idol worship. The origin of the cross actually comes from Babylon as a symbol of Tammuz, son of Semiramis (the queen of Babylon who diefied herself and her son). It's pagan. The temple of God is the human body. The church of God are the people who follow. There's no need for (and is actually sinful to have) an Earthly symbol.  The reason 'homosexuality' is so demonized is because it's pretty much active sin. Homosexuality itself isn't called out as sin (though Jesus states that holding lust in your heart, even if not acted upon, is a sin. Matthew 5:28) but homosexual acts themselves are the sin. However, any sin is forgiven through repentance. That means acknowledging it was wrong and living a holy life from there on out.  Stating that one is a homosexual basically calls out that they are unrepentant. Many people take pride in it. That's like a double whammy. It's not giving in to temptation, it's actively embracing it. 'Homosexual' is a willfully accepted identity that would likely last a person's whole life.  An unrepentant sinner does not inherit the kingdom of God.   These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. (Matthew 15:8)   If you believe in that stuff."

TrueOffMyChest,3d8why,momzill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:44:32 2015 UTC,"What is the sexist anti-man crap?   Also have you considered that being rude to her probably won't change her perceptions. If she is intelligent she is capable of discussion. The question is, are you?"
TrueOffMyChest,3d8why,ppotaco,2,Wed Jul 15 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"Well I have news for you, men CAN be victims of sexism, rape and discrimination.   She keeps posting articles about how men can't be victims of rape, sexism and discrimination. She also defends the people who genuinely think that #killallmen is a legitimate movement.  I don't get where you think I was ever rude to her, thanks for assuming though. I never told her that this stuff is offensive because I saw other people do it and they were just told off."
TrueOffMyChest,3d8why,ppotaco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:27:54 2015 UTC,Your welcome. I find assumptions make conversations quicker. However this can have the opposite affect when only one person takes the effort to assume meaning so I will expand for you.   Hoping you never have to work with her implies to me that in the future you intend to ignore her which I equate with rude behavior. You can correct me if I'm wrong if you had no intention of ignoring her.  I have never heard of that hashtag and was genuinely curious what the sexist anti-man crap is. I find it odd to believe but I suppose anything is possible.
TrueOffMyChest,3d8why,ppotaco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:33:31 2015 UTC,"Hoping to not work with her and ignoring her if I do work with her again on a project is not the same thing. Separating my professional and personal life is something I have no problem doing.  But hey, you know, assuming things about people is where stuff like racism and sexism come from so yeah keep on going dude. /s"
TrueOffMyChest,3d8why,ppotaco,2,Wed Jul 15 03:38:43 2015 UTC,"Everyone makes assumptions in conversation. That is how words work. They are merely symbols that we read and interpret. These interpretations are our assumptions.   If I interpret something you did not mean to imply, then correct me as I said early. Now you have. We have successfully communicated. Huzzah    As a side note, I find men who don't like feminists and what not (now this is an observation) tend to be really sensitive when they feel their character is being threatened and surprisingly revert to a more commonly feminine way of communicating with passive aggressive language. Such as you thanking me etc   I find it interesting. Thank you for providing me with more words to ponder. You have been useful."
