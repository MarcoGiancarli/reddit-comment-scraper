Aborted foetuses were used in UK hospitals as part of their waste to energy heating systems. They were treated as clinical waste and therefore were not afforded the respect that they should have been afforded. This information was only revealed after some FOI requests and, when it reached the papers, it was almost immediately banned by the government.   As far as I know, it was more an unthinking thing than a deliberate policy. They were classed as clinical waste and therefore treated as such.   http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/thousands-of-unborn-foetuses-incinerated-to-heat-uk-hospitals-9212863.html"
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,Arctic_Fax,18,Tue Jul 21 11:35:10 2015 UTC,Well what else are they? If we're going to start burying them and giving them funerals we probably should stop aborting them in the first place!  If we're going to accept abortion as a thing that happens then the aborted foetus is clinical waste and should be treated as such.
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,ggow,7,Tue Jul 21 16:35:34 2015 UTC,"Well, they're foetuses. Not babies, but there's still an emotional aspect of it for a lot of women. Sometimes the abortion isn't by 'choice' but maybe a necessity or whatever. The mother should be given the option on what they'd like to do, in case they need to grieve and come to terms with it. It's much more complicated than you'd like to portray it."
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,Arctic_Fax,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"Well I'm a little bit opposed to abortion to be honest (I think it should be discouraged a lot more than it currently is).   In medical cases/terminations they do offer burials etc., but this is for the parent's own wellbeing and that's fine, but if the mother doesn't want to see the foetus or have any part in its disposal then I don't see why we should feel obligated to dispose of them like babies. To do that is to acknowledge that a foetus is a sentient life form, and that makes abortion without medical justification, murder.   While its fine for individuals to believe this (and therefore request a burial of a foetus) if the NHS believes this then it makes the entire process of abortion morally despicable."
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,WontReply,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:01:06 2015 UTC,"Although not relevant to the original post, I would argue about the point   I don't see why we should feel obligated to dispose of them like babies. To do that is to acknowledge that a foetus is a sentient life form, and that makes abortion without medical justification, murder.   I would say they aren't sentient as they are usually aborted long before they can survive on their own, therefore incapable of being sentient or aware.   However you can still have an emotional connection to something that isn't sentient, such as a teddy bear or a memory of your mother or a dead body such that you treat that object with respect, while recognising that it is essentially just an object (i.e. not sentient)  Therefore showing respect to aborted foetuses does not suggest someone's view about the sentience of foetuses."
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,Arctic_Fax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that, but if you abort a foetus and don't take any interest in the way it is disposed of, don't request a burial etc. then I don't see why the NHS should be obliged to do anything except throw it in the incinerator with the rest of the clinical waste. If you do have an emotional attachment to the foetus and request a burial or a blessing by a vicar or whatever then the NHS should provide that, and they do, funerals, as always are for the living, not the dead.    The other argument is that aborted foetuses have some innate right to a proper funeral, but if this is the case then I would say it is a logical imperative that they also have a right to life, but at the moment the UK has nearly 200,000 non-medical abortions a year, so rather than campaigning for funerals for foetuses we should probably start by looking at whether aborting a foetus is right in the first place!  i.e. if throwing a foetus in the incinerator is morally wrong, they surely an abortion is orders of magnitude worse!"
ShitAmericansSay,3e1u3d,WontReply,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:08 2015 UTC,"Sure thats fine, I wasn't arguing that point about the whats done with aborted foetuses. Just disagreeing the conclusion that individuals or the NHS showing respect to aborted foetuses means that they have to accept that they murdered something.   If someone thinks that    aborted foetuses have some innate right to a proper funeral   then you probably are against abortion.   But no one is actually making that argument that aborted foetuses have an innate right to a funeral.   People are only making the argument that you shouldn't incinerate aborted foetuses with other waste as often aborted foetuses have more emotional attachment and history to them than a needle for example. Further, just like many would not incinerate somebody's dead father, a dead body (just like a foetus) isn't sentient either but most people still wouldn't incinerate either to generate heat.   I equate a foetus to a dead body as at the stage that foetuses are aborted they usually aren't capable of surviving on their own and thus aren't capable of sentience so are kind of useless much like a dead body but still can obviously have a lot of emotional connection attached to it again much like a dead body can.  It still doesn't change my point - that if you give an aborted foetus a funeral it doesn't equate to you believing it was sentient and a human being with all its human rights, merely you had an emotional attachment to that object as you could to many objects and you want to give it some respect.   Although I can totally see why disposing of aborted foetuses separate to other waste to heat hospital would be advisable however. If you take the view as many people do that abortion is wrong, then to be treated in a hospital where the heat your taking advantage of is generated by abortion, many patients would be morally uncomfortable with that. Thats not suggesting funerals should be held for aborted foetuses (although thats an option) just a different disposal method could be used.   Its important to note in the report about the burning of foetuses, it said mother's who had lost their babies were often not consulted about what they want done with the remains. Hopefully things are better now."

Hopefully things are better now.   I could be wrong, but I think they only ask you what you want if its a medical abortion or a termination.   I would think if if voluntarily abort a pregnancy and then give it a funeral, you would probably be better off seeing a psychiatrist, because that shit will fuck you up.  But yes, I think we generally agree with each other, and aside from anything its a PR disaster to start heating your hospital using aborted babies!"

There is also a group of non-Americans who don't lose every day, they are known as Low Level Europeans. This group was saved by America.   Armed with this info, I have decided that while it was nice to ask about my feeling about historical events, it was poorly asked, but the rest of the statement was a reference to Anti-Gambling laws prevalent in the USA. He correctly deduced my ability to gamble on horses easily via online websites or in betting shops located near my house and that I also do live close to sea level (That's the reference to being Low Level, and maybe some oblique reference to the fact that horses can run faster closer to see level) he correctly surmises that I do lose frequently. If only I would learn to stop my gambling habit I would be 'saved' by the freedom loving Americans.

As for Lilith, by some accounts she was Adam's first wife.  I think the story is from the Alphabet of Ben Sira, which is canonically questionable. The concept comes from Genesis 1:27 suggesting that a woman had already been made, in God's image as Adam had been.  She didn't want to be on the bottom during sex, so she left and God made Eve from Adam's rib in Genesis 2:22. Folklore then suggests that Lilith hooked up with Asmodeus.

ShitAmericansSay,3dx83d,Zwemvest,16,Mon Jul 20 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"Additionally every state has a work center that can send you out for jobs and many have temp centers that will get you a job and paid in the same 24 hours.   That's not really a longtime unemployment solution.  The rest of your points are valid, if they are true (I was not aware of them). A library card might be expensive to come by, and that's the only counterargument I have."

ShitAmericansSay,3dx83d,The_Lunatic,2,Mon Jul 20 11:46:41 2015 UTC,"No, the temp work jobs are not long term, though they can turn into long term solutions.  My husband worked for one for 9 months and it kept the bills paid.  Usually if they find you can do the job well, you are pretty much guaranteed work at the temp agency.  The only downsides, no worker protections at all.  That means no sick days, no hazard pay, no training for dangerous jobs, no unemployment insurance even if you were a temp worker at one place for 2 years, and you have no guarantee of a job tomorrow.  Which means they can fire you because you got hurt on the job.  You could be disabled for years and never ever have a way to survive again and the company would owe you nothing.  Actually this very thing happened to my husband for five years.  It took 3 surgeries, out of pocket, to get him where he could function enough to find employment.    He is currently full-time employed at a factory making flooring, with worker protections and insurance for everything you can think of.    Library cards are free.  Children can receive them if they sign their name and their guardian signs a release.  Anyone can ask for a library card, even non-residents or even people from other countries.

The more vocal left wing posters have given up or only shitpost.   An interesting trend I've noticed on reddit is that younger redditors seem more inclined towards conservative or rightwing viewpoints than older redditors. Not sure what to make of that as it's stereotypically supposed to be the other way around.
ShitAmericansSay,3dx83d,FUCK_YOU_HEISENBERG,7,Mon Jul 20 12:35:36 2015 UTC,"Well it's to do with the ambiguous nature of the terms ""left"" and ""right"". When you say right wing, you're thinking in economic terms, whereas older people may (through generational shifts in social values) find themselves in a socially right wing position, due simply to holding views that were current when they were younger. So when an older person complains that the youth are very left wing, they possibly are thinking in a purely social sense (gay marriage, for example), while you interpret it as meaning ""young people are all socialists"" (which is clearly absurd, especially on reddit).  In any case, an online community (reddit?) that constantly whinges that it's ""very left wing"" is, paradoxically, not left wing at all. It's just full of people who are so used to being on the ""correct"" side of public opinion that they get angry at the few patches of dissent they encounter and blow them way out of proportion."

If you're not left-wing by 30, you don't have a heart.    At least, that proverb was verified in my case: as a teen, I admired the beauty, simplicity and impartiality of a theoretically pure capitalist system. During the next decade, I realised that, in practice, pure capitalism was ugly, messy and anything but impartial.

Even in America, WWE/pro wrestling has a reputation for having a fanbase of losers and hillbillies and gullible idiots who think it's real. Naturally, people like that are going to love the WWE, but it has its fair share of fans in the US and around the world who can watch it 'one step removed' (ie knowing it's fake) and be entertained.  The main guys will always be handsome white Americans and Canadians (or, in the case of The Rock, a handsome white/black American/Canadian/Samoan) and there will always be cartoon foreign stereotypes for them to overcome, but nowadays there's more and more guys like Finn Balor (Irish), Sami Zayn (Syrian/Canadian), Kevin Owens (French Canadian) Adrian Neville (a geordie) and Cesaro (Swiss) who are beloved (or despised, depending on their role) by the fans despite their foreign passports, and whose nationalities aren't played upon.

And Americans have no appreciation for how shitty they are at British or Irish accents. Brits can often pull of American accents much better than Americans can pull of a British or Irish accent.    The US is probably the most diverse country on Earth with regard to accents   This person has clearly never visited the U.K or Ireland. Or they must have gone into deafness mode if they have.    and English with an English accent sounds redundant   That doesn't make any sense.    I've read a theory that the dialect is similar to that of Elizabethan England. The idea there is that settlers came over and that area remained fairly isolated due to the hills and valleys and such, and so folks didn't have as much contact with the outside world and/or settlers from disparate countries as in like the Carolinas or Pennsylvania or New York. So the accent only morphed a little in the last couple hundred years.   There's that myth again. People from West Virginia don't sound like people from Elizabethan England.    What the heck is the difference between ""England"" and ""Britain"" anyway? And Scotland and Ireland. Are they separate countries, or provinces, or what?   This person could easily find that out on Google but fuck putting a little bit of effort in.    Most Americans only consider England ""British"".   It probably has something to do with the fact that the US and Britain have a bit of history...    I can't take much more of this.    Cause most Americans don't know the difference between England and Britain, and you can't blame them because it's dammed complicated.   No, it's not.    Texan is an English accent, Scottish is an English accent, Australian is an English accent, they are all English accents. British is a specific accent.    The fucking stupidity of this person. An England accent is an accent from England. You don't base an accent on the language a person speaks. I won't start speaking with a French accent if I speak French.    The UK actually has an accent not the U.S. We use to sound the same until Rich people in southern England started speaking differently and it eventually we now speak the same.

The guy's identity is masked, the cops won't come fast enough to get him, they certainly aren't going to waste resources on sitting by your house in case he comes back (or ramping up cruisers in the area).   The only logical thing to do is shoot the person to protect yourself and your family. It is THAT person's fault for getting shot, because they harassed you, your family, and your home by indicating that they want to do harm to you.   I have no idea why anyone would disagree with that.

What else are you supposed to do? Challenge him to a baton duel? Go grab your asp and get ready for a good old fashioned front-lawn fight? How do you know he doesn't have other people around?  You can call the police, but they won't get there on time and they won't be able to identify the person and, even if they choose to launch an investigation (probably not) it will take days or months to find any results. In which case, guess what? Dude can come back and finish what he started. Police are never any help.   So... again... you shoot him. There is no other option that makes sense in this situation.

When dangerous people attack you and your family, you shoot them.   What I'm saying isn't disturbing, it's common sense and it's a mentality shared by MOST people in America's heartland and south.   If you do something like this to someone you SHOULD expect to be shot, which is why you don't do it. If you still know the possibility that the person you're harassing has a gun and you do it anyway, you should not for some reason be surprised when a gun is pulled on you.

Pretty clear cut case. Not sure how this is hard to understand. You fuck with somebody that way - you die. You get shot. Plain and simple.   The lesson? Don't do it. I guess when you live in a nation of pussies, everyone is your best friend and presents no harm to you.

There was no mention of the robber having a weapon, so there was no major threat to life. He was killed (and according to popular American opinion deservedly so) for attempted theft of property.

Again, this is what makes the USA the strongest, most capable, most independent, and most free nation on the fucking planet.   It boggles my mind why anyone would be sent to jail ""for five years"" for simply defending themselves against a mugger. If you mug someone - you are risking being shot and ending your life. Plain and simple and you have every right as someone who is under threat in that way to make such a decision. You have no idea what a mugger is willing to do - slit your throat, shoot you themselves, get their buddies to beat you with an inch of your life.

Your friend just killing a man for trying to mug him is just wrong. He has no right to be judge, jury and executioner.   THATS why he would be send to prison in Germany.

You have no fucking clue if they have a gun, you have no fucking clue if they're going to slit your throat, you have no fucking clue if they're going to beat you to within an inch of your life.   In the REAL world, you cannot wait around for the police to come and them to get arrested...etc. Chances are they will get away and you could end up dead.   Therefore, under COMMON SENSE (aka US Law) if someone is displaying behavior in which you realistically perceive a threat (aka I'm mugging you and you have no idea what I may or may not do next) you have every right under US Law and various Stand Your Ground laws to shoot that person.   This is the correct thing to do. Fuck Germany - I can't perceive of a more dangerous place to live in. ""Oh - hey person robbing me, I'm not only in danger of you while you take my belongings, I'm also in danger of going to jail FOR FIVE FUCKING YEARS if I take any common-sense precautions to defend myself against you.""  Your country is fucked in the collective head. You think your government and your legal system is going to protect you? My god you're an idiot. The law and the legal system never protect you - you can ONLY protect yourself.

If you're living in a society where that is likely to happen to you, your country is shit. Now, I can sort of understand why you'd feel the need to arm yourself if that is your reality, but it isn't ours. When we are victims of crime, we call the police, the police handles the situation, the criminals are apprehended, they are put in jail and they are given a sentence in a court appropriate to their crimes. We have built our societies to function properly and thus have no need to take the law into our own hands. You might call that a nanny state, but I'll take it any day over living in your perfect country, where apparently violent home invasions seem to be a regular thing, the police can't help anyone and you have to be armed and ready to kill people who want to hurt you every day.

Not all people who go to war are a hero.  Not all military personnel are heroes.  It is such a disservice to actual heroes of war (or even other professions) when every person to put on a damn uniform gets called a hero.

He had crashed two planes prior to his Vietnam deployment. As a pilot, that would've grounded you and not gotten you a frontline combat job, which McCain got, thanks to his dad. McCain should never have flown over Vietnam in the first place, he was a failed pilot.    And the first thing this ""war hero"" did when he returned home, was to cheat on his disabled wife with a hot rich blond who could finance McCains political ambitions and he has milked his time in Vietnam to the fullest.

In the pub, at the bar, sits a an, alone. He's the kind of guy that seems part of the furniture, people flit past without taking much notice, his hand firmly clasped around the last half of his fifth pint. A young American man walks in with his girlfriend in tow, excitedly talking about the latest tourist attraction they visited, and how awesome it was. The young American glances around, and sees this Irish man taking another sip. ""Yes. This is him."" He thinks to himself. After an hour or so of chatting away to his girlfriend and telling the barman that they just flew over from the state's, (first time abroad, yes that's right, and really enjoying it too! It's a fine little country!) They get up, prepare to face the biting cold wind of the Irish summer. The young American walks over, pats the lone Irish man on the back and puts a snickers on the bar. With a wide grin, the American says ""Here pal, that's for you. That's a candy bar, all the way from the USA. It's called a snickers."" The Irish man stares blankly back, as the American couple turn to leave. Just as the door closes, the Irish man turns to the barman, disbelief of his face as he picks up the bar.

ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,big_swinging_dicks,7,Sun Jul 19 01:16:30 2015 UTC,"Classic jealous Europeans. [Jealous of our] Freedom, our culture, the fact that you're right now spouting bullshit at American on AMERICAN website using AMERICAN Internet. You hate us cuz you ain't us, that's why this place is filled with thousands of jealous Europeans. But hey, I won't get butthurt about some person from country that never landed on the moon complain about USA.  Snapshots:   This post Link   I am a bot. (Info | Contact)"
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,yankbot,18,Sat Jul 18 11:52:54 2015 UTC,Meh was an honest mistake
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,__Saga__,11,Sat Jul 18 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"Most definitely was, though it developed into SAS material once he started talking about American pizza diversity."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,arowberry,6,Sat Jul 18 17:42:19 2015 UTC,"Poor guy, he's not even being offensive, just stereotypically ignorant."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,Ponkers,3,Sat Jul 18 20:17:10 2015 UTC,"/r/ireland is providing me with some belly-laughs today.   After reading all the comments I have come to the conclusion that you are a colossal gobshite, and the stereotypical American."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,Chive,4,Sat Jul 18 22:28:46 2015 UTC,"You joke, but vegemite goes pretty well with croissants."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,ThereIsBearCum,3,Sat Jul 18 15:08:09 2015 UTC,I might ask around in /r/AskUK and see if anyone knows a good home-made Irish Stew recipe.
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,DisgruntledBrit,5,Sat Jul 18 15:25:33 2015 UTC,tbh that wouldn't be so bad because of Northern Ireland
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,Cheese-n-Opinion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"Good point, well made."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,DisgruntledBrit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:36:12 2015 UTC,"Liverpool would probably be pretty up on it, too."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,TheScarletPimpernel,2,Sat Jul 18 18:25:09 2015 UTC,So... you're NOT Mexican?
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,shun-16,9,Sat Jul 18 15:44:35 2015 UTC,Thank you for your service!

ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,KingofCoconuts,19,Sat Jul 18 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"But yet so many Americans love to tell us how Murica is big, and each state is a different country"
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,Barry_Scotts_Cat,11,Sun Jul 19 07:55:40 2015 UTC,"We are taught England is England, Ireland is Ireland, Scotland is Scotland, and it's all the UK or British Isles. We aren't taught the different provinces.   I wish that were true. From what I gather England and Britain are interchangeable and Scotland is something else entirely. Wales is forgotten, as per tradition."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,DisgruntledBrit,5,Sat Jul 18 16:15:27 2015 UTC,Exactly. I saw some thread the other day where someone was asking if Americans could identify different accents from the UK and one guy said he could identify two - the British accent and the Scottish accent. Fuck's sake...
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,GaryJM,6,Sat Jul 18 16:30:13 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, that's the source of the humour. Ignorance of geography is a pretty well known American stereotype."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,ThereIsBearCum,4,Sat Jul 18 16:31:37 2015 UTC,Its a bloody Cornish Pastry!!!!
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,RTE2FM,2,Sat Jul 18 16:42:26 2015 UTC,Oh the ignorance..
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,RyaaanC,5,Sat Jul 18 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it too much, we get stuff like this all the time and it's hard to tell if something is ignorance or a simple mistake."
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,Beefymcfurhat,7,Sat Jul 18 16:11:02 2015 UTC,"And all you actually had to do, was to Google 'recipe cornish pasties' and you would've gotten tons of them.     Have you never heard of Google in USA?"
ShitAmericansSay,3dq9cg,W00ster,4,Sat Jul 18 16:48:02 2015 UTC,"So, what you mean is you wanted a recipe someone hadn't put on the internet?"
