I did a lot of research earlier this year into tattoo parlours that were around in the early 90's in Atlanta. Unfortunately, there was only a few. I sent enquiries to each one of these, and heard nothing back.  Along with that, I posted to /r/tattoos for any assistance and heard nothing there either.  I agree with you that in this instance, Imgur may not be terribly helpful. I think the key in this case is making contact with LE and ME and seeing if they would support us making contact with local businesses to have fliers put up.  Unfortunately though.. Contact with people related to this case is very difficult. There are really only one or two people who reply to my contact, the rest.. Nothing. It is incredibly distressing, and we are very lucky that the ones who do reply are very helpful.  I think we need another great brainstorming session, because it just feels like one road block after another with this case :("

We just don't have enough stranger addictions of kids in this country for us to have no idea who this could be, otherwise. We all know about Daniel Morcombe or William Tyrell or Bung Siraboon - if a 2-5 year old girl had been reported missing any time over the past few years as anything other than a non custodial parent type abduction I feel like we'd know about it.

gratefuldoe,3dft53,TVConefive,3,Thu Jul 16 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"Great question, Nal!  It really depends here. I wouldn't say that there is one group more than another that goes missing.   It is very difficult with Aboriginals here. The reason that is, is that many live in desolate communities in the middle of nowhere, where most of the time, they don't have means of contact with anybody. If somebody goes 'missing' from one of these communities, it can never be assumed that they have gone missing, or just travelled elsewhere.  So I wouldn't say there is one group that goes missing more than another! I think it really ranges.  How about in France?!"
gratefuldoe,3dbyqb,TVConefive,3,Wed Jul 15 02:10:01 2015 UTC,"My thoughts have changed a little on this since the last time it came up.   I favored missing persons as the best area because it could be set up in a way to assure every reported missing person would be looked at. Also we could avoid multiple people going over the same lists which would free them up to work in other areas where help was needed.   My reasoning for this is most members enjoy this part and love the challenge and it is covered fairly well. I still have no doubt we would benefit greatly by creating a systematic approach by a group.   Because this is setup in general as one month per case time and timing are critical.   Time because anything not done by the end of the month may never get done. An example would be Social Media. If we want to flood an area with information on this case and only half of it gets done we don't know how effective it could have been. Did we miss getting this information to the right person or people because we didn't have the time and resources to cover everything we should have? Social media is our best chance of solving a case. If anyone read the ""Missing, Missing"" post you know that many people do not get reported as missing, we are not going to find them in a missing persons site. Look at Jason, he was not on any list. Getting the picture and information to the right area is what will solve it.   Timing because not having all the information in one topic can cause us to go down the wrong road in another. An example of this would be Annandale Jane's vitals. Her height was listed as 5', but we found out later that two newspapers listed her as 5' 5"". A 5"" height difference would be ruled out in missing persons searches. We still don't know what information is correct since we never saw the police and ME reports. I admit this isn't the best example but my point is in some cases it's beneficial to have complete and correct information from one topic before we get into another."

If he feels it could have been deliberate we should try to find evidence of similar acts around that time and see if the police ever solved these crimes. Of course we will again run into a problem with accessing information like that. The newspaper is a possibility but it may not have been newsworthy enough to print. If we could find a reporter who would be interested in this story they may be able to dig up things that we can't. If we decide to go that route we should try to fill in and connect as many pieces of the puzzle as possible first. I know that's what we do anyhow but maybe looking at it from the position of a reporter would help us get a little further and would make it more interesting to them.

From the skeptic angle it was probably my brain doing some kind of subconscious cold reading but honestly I feel like maybe it was actually like, a message.

I think I made a better work a month ago with the maps and whatnot ; I don't know if you checked on them yet. We also debated a lot along with a bunch of other users and came with some theories and ideas. I discovered that a 3 minutes path existed in the early nineties from a nearby house directly leading to the patch of forest where the JCD was found, so I speculated that he could come from there and that he wasn't in this particular patch by pure chance. Also I was able to notice the average distance between the exact place where he was found (I don't know if it's on the document yet ?) the ""Shady hill"" trailer park, and the Carver-Roehl park, which where places of interests in the case. I would like to have your opinion on this, because while slim, I think this could be valuable information anyway.   u/dragthewaters91 I wonder if you came with something new after all this time ?"

gratefuldoe,3ct3qp,TVConefive,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah not meet in person but he is on the GD Skype group regularly. As for the other stuff it's really conjecture that likely wont be verified one way or the other unless some massive breakthrough in the case occurs, so I dont think he has much of an opinion on it. Same with stuff like JCD being mentally ill, what drugs he was on, if he was River Guy, etc. The main focus for him is just trying to follow what we know instead of speculate on what we cant know."
gratefuldoe,3ct3qp,TVConefive,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:29:14 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I thought it could be interesting to know more about this trail, who used it, if the place which was connected to the trail was used by local youngster etc.   Apparently the region hosted a lot of metal workers ? Someone said JCD's pendant was probably the work of such a worker (I know it was traced to a local crafter, but couldn't the crafter be from this said background ?). Also, I noticed on google earth that quite a lot of poprieties in the area accumulate a lot of abandonned cars, I suppose they use them for the scrap metal ? One of those was the one which connected to JCD's forest patch via the 90's path."
gratefuldoe,3ct3qp,dragthewaters91,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:39:53 2015 UTC,"Ok I asked him if he has any more info on the trail.  The crafter was just a local metalhead and as far as I know didnt have any formal training. Those pendants dont look too hard to make and they even had some replicas made.  The abandoned cars could be old broken down cars that are being worked on. I feel like a lot of rural properties have those. In any case the people in that area including the people who owned the property on which he was found, were interviewed extensively in 1995 and some were re-interviewed in 2014. As well as the crafter and all the friends that he recalled giving pendants too, and Jack plans to re-interview those people."
gratefuldoe,3ct3qp,dragthewaters91,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"Excellent ! Thanks for everything.   I assume the forest patch where he was found was owned by the people who also owned the property which was connected to it, by the south ?"

Do you think it could be feasible/a good idea to make several photographs of the area where he was found and the surrounding, notably the places which are of interests (Carver-Roelh park, ""shady hills"", the creek itself), or to obtain photographs from around the time he was found (early/mid nineties) ?   Of course, the idea isn't to trespass in the actual private proprieties  (at least that you have their approval !), but rather to have a general idea of the place, what path the JCD could have taken, what specific interesting place the JCD could have been or sought for. I think anything new could be worth it and having a better general idea of the surrounding for the non locals here such as myself would be in any case helpful.  Also, does it snow a lot in winter ? It is generally assumed that the JCD lived by spring/summer, but apparently comparisons with body farms experiments point out the idea that he died by winter. If it is very cold in the area at this time of year, then the possibility that he died from exposure would be high."

gratefuldoe,3ct3qp,TVConefive,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I am quite skeptical over the idea that he  went missing as a child. It's theoretically possible, but seems quite off.

But granted, apparently cases of family abduction where the chidren continues somehow a normal life in another state with another name exist, though."

They also made some good points as to how they would know if she died in the woods nearby. Same with why an abduction was unlikely.  The only thing that occurred to me would be she fell into a very deep hole or crevice. But I don't know if the geology of the area could make that a possibility.

This is intended to make sure the trucker is following the rules of staying on and off the road as he/she should and not driving for 18 hours straight or taking a route that is not pre-approved. But if a trucker is a suspect, I could see the courts subpoena-ing those GPS records and using it to corroborate their stories. I wonder if existing serial killers who are truckers are somehow deterred by this and whether/how their activities change as a result."

Maybe but I think for the most part a serial killer believes he is smarter then the police and will never get to the point of being a suspect.   It's an interesting subject and I continue to look into it. I may eventually come across information on that.   I was curious just how many truckers were identified as serial killers and I found this information from the Texas Observer:   In her book, Ginger Strand identifies about 25 former truckers currently serving time in U.S. prisons for multiple murders. She quotes Eric Hickey, dean of the California School of Forensic Studies at Alliant International University, describing truck-driving serial killers as “opportunistic.” Part oft the problem may be truck stops themselves, which Hickey describes as “absolutely fascinating places for criminal activity.”   And this from the ID Discovery Channel. It looks like they're having a program about it on August 13th.    With 25 former long-haul truckers serving time in America's prison system for serial murder, Investigation Discovery's all-new documentary special, ID INVESTIGATES: KILLER TRUCKERS takes a hard look at predators in the fast lane, illuminating a dark corner of America's mobile society, in which the open road can both hide and drive deadly intentions.   25!!!!   These women are dumped in another state, most have no ID and may not have ever been reported as an MP in the first place. We could search every reported MP in the US and she is not even there. That's why the Social Media part of this is so important. And hopefully if we get the information to the right place someone will recognize the Doe."

gratefuldoe,3buznu,Petrol_in_my_eyes,6,Thu Jul 2 11:02:46 2015 UTC,"As a local Atlien, I'm guessing no, for a couple of reasons. (I grew up in Atlanta and was living there when this happened.)  Yes, there are definitely gangs in Atlanta, and in Metro Atlanta - but they're almost completely racially exclusive, and they don't travel into other gang's territory without a good reason. The area FCJD was found in is a 'black area' and you have to travel for a long time to reach a 'white' or 'hispanic' area. Black people are in black gangs (Crips, Bloods, Doom) Hispanics are in Hispanic gangs (Latin Kings, some others who's names I can't recall).  And white gangs tend to be on the Neo-Nazi front.   FCJC was either white or hispanic. The area he was found in is vastly majority black. There isn't any reason for a non-black person to be in that area (except to go to the amphitheater or maybe the base). Hispanics, at the time, (and probably still now) lived in areas around Chamblee-Doraville, and Buford hwy area miles away. And white gangs would be in the rural or at least 'lower end suburban' areas.  A white person or Hispanic person, if he was in a gang, wouldn't be in another gang's area without a good reason.    Also, he has tattoos, but no gang tattoos. If he was in a gang, it seems logical that he would have at least one gang symbol. His dragon seems like the typical 'metal head who likes dragons' type tat.   Also, the deliberate dumping a body on the side of 75/85 in the evening (he was found before midnight) seems like it would have drawn a lot of attention.  75/85 is a major 6 lane highway (more lanes in places), if someone wanted to dump a body discreetly or without being caught, 75/85 isn't the place to do it.  I'm just going on what I know about the area and about gangs in Atlanta in the 90's.  He could have been in some kind of gang, but based on where he was, his race and his appearance, I don't think so. The sketch they did of him when he was first found showed him with long-ish hair.  From what I remember, I think gangbangers have shaved heads most of the time.   Dumping a body on the side of the highway would be likely to attract a lot of attention, 75/85 is really busy."

I had just graduated high school when this happened and he seems like someone I could have known peripherally. I've thought a lot about this guy. My dad moved to Atlanta from rural GA in his early 20's and was a bit of a gypsy/hippie for a while, working here and there and going to concerts and stuff, taking silly risks with his life, that he now has stories to tell about because he survived. He reminds me of this guy in a way.   This guy really reminds me of a lot of people I've known over the years."

gratefuldoe,3buznu,Idontlovethem,3,Thu Jul 2 12:34:04 2015 UTC,"The only things close to where he was found that are well known are Lakewood Amphitheater and Fort McPherson.  Homeless people in Atlanta tend to congregate around Little 5 Points or the main 5 Points Marta Station, and parts of downtown, not down in the Lakewood area. This guy was miles away from anything that a homeless person would want or need. This is a really economically deprived, but residential area.   In Atlanta, homeless/panhandlers go where there are people who have money walking around, and that is not this area.  (Virginia Highlands, the west end of Ponce.)   If you're homeless in Atlanta, you're not gonna be in this area, especially if you're white.   ETA: full disclosure, I believe he was on his way to the concert at Lakewood that night.  I think he thought he could get there by taking Atlanta's crappy train service (MARTA) and tried to walk from the station (which is called Lakewood/Fort McPherson) to the concert, because the bus service is almost non existent. (Atlanta public transport isn't great now and it was total crap 20 years ago, I know from experience.)  Here's a map of where I think he walked from the train station (on the left/west side) toward the amphitheater.  http://imgur.com/M6nk5Ub  He wouldn't have been able to see (or reach) the bridge to the north, and he chanced it crossing 75/85 on foot, and didn't make it."

He mentioned that around the Airport there was a group of people that would ask a person for a light/the time/etc and when they were looking for the lighter/their watch etc they would hit them in the head with something and steal their shit.  I guess it happened to him once, and he said that he had to bear mace the guy to keep from getting 'whacked' with a crow bar.  Any thoughts on this?"
gratefuldoe,3buznu,Idontlovethem,3,Thu Jul 2 12:51:44 2015 UTC,"Interesting, very interesting. But he was found right on the side of the highway, that leads me to believe he was hit by a car trying to cross.  But that's really interesting about the airport dead zone. And yeah, asking for a light is a common ruse for muggers, to be honest.   Did your stepdad have any stories about seeing people try to cross the highway? I remember seeing it once or twice in Atlanta, someone taking a massive chance trying to run across a patch of highway.

I don't think he was from the city of Atlanta, or from the inner suburbs. If he's from the Metro Area, he's from outlying counties, but honestly I think he's from a more rural area.

gratefuldoe,3buznu,Idontlovethem,3,Thu Jul 2 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"*edited for clarity  he had no idea it was there.  He didn't have an overhead map like we are looking at. He came from the marta station and had no idea there was an overpass, or even how to get there.  edit: if you're referring to crossing over on 166, he wouldn't have been able to walk that way on foot. No chance. It's a concrete roadway with no shoulder. He would have been honked at and probably been hit if he tried to walk across 166. Imagine trying to walk down a waterslide while people are coming down the waterslide, that's what 166 is like right there.  (there is a bridge at the north of the picture that someone asked about before, that's the one I was referring to above.)  Atlanta is not designed for pedestrians."

They would have had to *put his bloody body in the car, drive down 75/85, then pull over on the hard shoulder, drag his body out, and dump it.  Even if they 'kicked' a body out, the surrounding drivers would have seen it.  Someone dumping a body on the side of that highway would have been seen by seen by hundreds of cars.   It's possible, but that kind of body dump is not a gang MO that I'm aware of, and I would be surprised if someone didn't report seeing something like that to the police.  75/85 is a major, fast moving highway. Heavy traffic.   I could see it happening on a side road or a quiet road, but on 75/85, there would have been a bunch of witnesses.  *eta, but it's a theory that's worth investigating if someone wants to cover that angle. I'm just not aware of gangs in Atlanta operating that way."
gratefuldoe,3buznu,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jul 2 14:36:30 2015 UTC,"Did anyone see FCJD alive before he was hit? Didnt this happen at like 12 or 1 AM?

( thats a rhetorical question for now)"
gratefuldoe,3buznu,Idontlovethem,2,Thu Jul 2 15:32:31 2015 UTC,"Good question, I always believed they found him before midnight, because of the date. He was found 'late at night' rather than 'in the early hours of...' on the night of the concert.  I think he was hit early in the evening on his way to the show.  Also, it was a four act show, and it easily could have gone later than midnight, I think, but I don't know if it did or not.   He was found on the southbound side of the highway (closest to the station) which makes me think he never made it to the show.  Other reason I don't think he was coming back from the show is because if he had made it, he could have pretty easily met a new 'friend' or at least someone who could have given him a ride somewhere. ""Hey man, ace show, my name's John, any chance of a ride to the Marta station?""  ""Sure man, hey boss tattoo, where ya from?"" That kind of thing.   I just think if he made it to the show he could have easily found a way to get back safely, or he could have even just hung out with some people he met.   One thing I would really like to know is how the authorities were alerted to his presence. Did someone call 911 that evening ""I've seen a person on the side of the road,"" or was it the police passing by, or was it someone (a taxi driver?) who called the police and said ""I think I've just hit someone"".  I've never heard the taxi connection, but I've never read that article.    I did read somewhere that once the hospital admitted him, the police 'bowed out' and left it to the hospital to 'take over.' He was in Grady, which is where all the indigents and uninsured people go, it's also probably the closest hospital. Since the state was paying his medical bills, the hospital (which is really poorly run, my brother works on a project at Grady and he can attest to that), wouldn't have had any pressing 'need' or the resources to find his family.  Poor guy just slipped through the net.  And he didn't make the news in a big way that summer, either.  I just picture his family being like 'he moved up to Atlanta and we just never heard from him again...'    Do you have a link to the Donald Izzett article?    edit - just googled Donald Izzett. Holy mackrel."
gratefuldoe,3buznu,dragthewaters91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:02:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I always thought it was really late, like just before midnight. Without an incident report we have no way of knowing though.  Yes Im not sure if he was planning to go to the show at all. The likelihood all depends on what time this happened. Also if he was homeless, no ID, nobody to recognize him etc then how could he afford to go to the show? I'd imagine it would be at least $20, maybe more.  Considering they only have PM photos of him, I dont think they publicized his case at all when he was alive.  Yeah Donald Izzett is such a mystery too...I wonder what happened to him."

These are missing persons from NamUs, NAMPN, DoeNetwork and Charley Project that are similar to our Doe, and we are considering submitting or have already submitted and are waiting to hear back on.   If you would like to add someone to either of these lists, Please let myself know and I will add them - as well as forward it on to /u/zombiegrey and /u/pastor__of__muppets so they can update FCJD's document.

gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,5,Tue Jun 30 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"Whoah.   I'm like this right now o.O   I think you're absolutely right.   ETA: I think your idea about the train station is spot on.  You mentioned the closest train station to where she was found was in fact 'the end of the line' that comes up from the south? I absolutely think she could have been down south at some point, and then when she was ready to finally 'go', she rode the train as long as she could, got off and then decided to 'end things' where she had arrived.  Also, the fact that the van she left in wasn't found until August means she could have had a vehicle (to live in, and drive around in?) for several months after she went missing.    This timeline seems absolutely spot on, and your discovery about the train station is really compelling. Also, what you've noted about her personality is completely in line with what I believe, also.  Working at a group home, she would have had a lot of experience with death. The fact that she laid down on a plastic sheet before she killed herself really stood out to me. Only someone with experience or interest in dead bodies would think to do that, to make it easier for whoever found her to move her body.  10/10 for this theory. Wow."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Tue Jun 30 12:33:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for everything ! But I mostly come with the theory. If it wasn't for u/grimsb I probably would have never noticed her, since I'm not used to search in missing people databases, and I used a lot of what others users found or knew.   I don't understand well your idea about the van. I don't think she would have travelled the country in there to abandon it three or four months later just the next city from where she was last seen. Remember it wasn't found in the middle of nowhere but in Bay City, ""just"" 60 miles or so from here, and I suppose that Port Austin residents often travel in bigger surouding cities for business or purchases. Dona was heading to Bad Axe for shopping (I assume items for the group home). Bad Axe is straight south from Port Austin, 17.18 miles by car. If she went to Bad Axe but next headed for Bay City, she would have traveled 53.63 miles. (I use this website !) So I assume she directly abandoned her car and went for the bus station or another mean of transportation other than her own car. Perhaps she did tried to avoid her car to be found so she wouldn't be traced.  I wonder why it took so much time for the van to be found. But apparently losing a car in the middle of a city isn't that difficult. Some friends of mine told me how they had lost their own car in an airport garage after returning home from holidays, had to buy one again and found it one year later by pure chance, returning to the same airport. Knowing where and in what context the van was found could be crucial. I don't think this research can continue successfully if we don't come up with more information about Dona and the whole context."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Tue Jun 30 13:12:22 2015 UTC,"That's what I love about this sub, teamwork! u/grimsb is an absolute genius/star for making the connection :) Talk about eagle eyed! I find the MP files really difficult to sift through, and grimsb did an amazing job spotting Dona. When I saw her picture I was like 'omg, that's Annandale JD....'   To be honest, my idea about the van is simply that she stayed in the area and lived out of the van for possibly a few months. It would explain how an unemployed, not incredibly outdoorsy-seeming 49-year-old woman could survive having intentionally gone missing.    But, your theory of abandoning the van and taking off immediately makes sense, too.   I just wonder what kind of condition they found the van in, and whether or not she had lived out of it for a while before eventually leaving the area. Just a thought, though. When they found the van, did they take an inventory of what was found inside?  If we could get ahold of the police reports for when they found the van (and her MP report) that would be amazing.  Also, the report mentions that she 'loaded up some boxes' into the van.  I have a theory about that.... the nice Nordstrom clothes she was wearing? I think those may have belonged to a resident at the care home. Loading boxes into a car and then 'going shopping' seems like 'taking some stuff and leaving with it' to me.  I just think she probably may have taken some clothes or things that were left behind by family when one of the residents died.  Also, at this point, I think someone should really consider contacting the Port Austin Law Enforcement who are handling Dona Lee Thompson's case, and the Annandale LE's who found Jane Doe's body.  When do you think would be a good idea for someone to let them know about Annandale Jane Doe, and that we think we've found Dona Lee Thompson?  Also, just because I'm curious, I would like to know if it's possible to see the original, complete Missing Person's report for Dona Lee Thomson.  Who reported her missing, who did they interview, what did they say, that kind of thing.   The police have access to a lot more information and resources than we do, and with the information we have already, it looks like there is a very good reason for the two police departments to be in touch with each other.   Is it possible that the group home has a copy of DLT's fingerprints? Perhaps she had to do a criminal background check and her fingerprints are on file with Port Austin LE?  Annandale Jane Doe's fingerprints are on file, IIRC.....  OMG, I just had another thought! You know how everyone was really puzzled about the ""Louza"" apricot juice that Annandale JD had in her bag?  I wonder if the train company sells that brand of juice in the snack bar on their trains?  Or, perhaps it was sold at a hotel that she stayed at in the days before her death?  I worked at a Hilton for a while, and we always had really unique brands of snacks and drinks that were supplied by the corporate office, strange, kind of obscure brands that you may only find at the hotel.... I wonder if she got that apricot juice either on the train or at a hotel?"
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Tue Jun 30 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"mmmh... I don't know. The problem with this theory is that she could have been easily recognized, and if she was imediatly reported as missing (which I suppose is the case due to her job), she would have been actively sought for by authorities. It seems to me (correct me if I'm wrong, especially if you're a local. Locals would be highly prized here) that in this whole part of Michigan ""everyone know each other"", at least because people from the tinier towns regularly go to the bigger cities. I don't see why she would have lived on her own on a van near her job place ""for the lulz"" apart if she had a mental illness, which wasn't reported to be the case and doesn't fit with the whole idea of who she (and the AJD as well) was. She would need to go outside to shop for groceries and such and would had been spotted.  My idea would be much more that she had a ""breakup"" decided to escape her cumbersome everyday life, justly as far as where she lived and worked originally (and I suspect, since family wasn't mentionned at all, that her work was her life and that she spent most of her time as the group home manager) ; and that at some point of this vagrancy decided to end her life for some reason. I don't think she would have carried the Northstorm outfit for eight consecutive months, waiting for the ""good moment"" to kill herself. Remember that the clothes were in pristine condition when found (at least not as worn as the other items), unlike the knapsack and the jacket. It would have been too cumbersome to carry around for eight months in a knapsack. I think she genuinely bought them near the cemetery just before committing suicide, as well as for the Looza juice and the brandy.   (also, the fact she used a brandy make me think that she was already well used to this kind of alcohol. Perhaps she was herself a heavy drinker ? Since no autopsy was performed, I assume her liver wasn't checked ? Could their be other signs of heavy drinking or alcoholism other than the liver state she could have carried ?).   I think your connexion with the looza juice and what they sell on trains or hotels is excellent ! I definitely would want someone to dig that up further. I didn't thought about where she would have slept as a vagrant. She didn't seemed to be in bad health by what I know, so I suppose she wouldn't have slept outside and would have showered regularly, and had some amount of cash with her or the possibility to retire money from an ATM. Especially if we consider the fact it was winter. So I definitely think that she would have spent time in hotels and whatnot. But my guess was that she was used to sleep and literally live in amtrak trains.   I don't think that she would have sneaked clothes from her own home group, - it sounds like downright stealing ! But who knows who Dona was at this point… But my idea was simply that the boxes where here to load the merchandise she would had bought in Bad Axe for the group home. The idea I have is that the whole thing was just a pretext so she could flee unnoticed or unbothered for quite a time until she could manage to completely vanish from her surrounding.   For the rest ; it's up to the proper authorities to release us info or not. I suppose somebody more competent than me on the group could take care of that !"
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Tue Jun 30 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, now that I think about it, it would have been ridiculous for her to go AWOL from her job with her job's van and then just hang around town.   You're right that she probably left abruptly. I see it a lot more clearly now. She deffo would have had a lot of trouble staying hidden in a small town like that, especially when she left under such dramatic circumstances.  She probably did leave down really quickly, and the van, maybe she left the keys in it when she walked away and someone helped themselves to it, and dumped it when they didn't want it anymore.   And your theory about spending most of her time on trains? That's very compelling, and seems actually quite plausible.  Unusual, but, hey Annandale Jane Doe was a pretty unusual person, I think we can all agree on that one.  I wasn't aware that her nordstrom clothes were new, but now that you mention it, it does make sense that they would be. It's not uncommon at all for people who commit suicide after having considered it for a while, to 'dress up' for the occasion. As sad as that seems, I can completely see AJD doing that. And yeah, the newly bought clothes makes sense.  The more I think about this, the more I think you're right, that there was a 'break' of some kind at her work or something and she just kind of 'gave up' and walked away.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if she had had a hard-ish life, with not much 'real' family (you're right the care home could have been the only life or family she really had). And, I absolutely think she could very well have been a drinker.  We know that she was 49 years old. In the picture on the Namus site she looks quite a bit old for 49. I imagine drinking could have contributed to her looking as old as she did.  Also, the bracelet that she was wearing, the ""No Code, DNR, No Penicillin"" is exactly the kind of thing a person with ties to a retirement home would have. It's the kind of thing a resident would wear, and the kind of thing she probably had access to.   I feel a bit icky saying this, but I wonder if something had happened at the retirement home that compelled her to 'run away.'  The very odd thing is, she clearly lived a non-vagrant life for the nearly 9 months that she was missing.  That leads me to believe she had some money to support herself with, or to use as a cushion.  I would be really interested to know why she left her job so abruptly, effectively stole the car that belonged to the group home, did something with her life for the next 9 months, and THEN committed suicide.    Unless, and this is something that many on the sub have posited - she may have been terminally ill.  She may very well have been terminally ill because her suicide is consistent with the practices outlined in the pro-euthanasia/assisted suicide book ""Final Exit.""  I wonder if she knew, or believed, she was terminally ill and just didn't want to tell anyone at the group home because she didn't want sympathy.  She may have 'given up' fighting the illness.  This also may be why she looked quite a bit older than her 49 years. Also, because she had been surrounded by death and dying for so long that she didn't want to spend her last years (as she believed) around old and dying people.  Perhaps that's what it was, she didn't want anyone to know she was terminally ill, and she took her savings and 'rode the rails' for the last 9 months of her life, until she decided to 'hasten' her death the way the authors of the book Final Exit describe.  Sheesh, she must have been around the dead and dying for a long time, so the thought of suicide must not have been a big stretch for her.  If this really is her, this makes a lot of sense.  She 'ran away' because she knew or believed that the people around her would try and talk her out of suicide, but she was facing an illness that she felt she couldn't fight.  Man, oh man. Sooo many pieces coming together now.   And what you've said about the trains makes a LOT of sense. It explains how she got out of Port Austin without the van, it explains how she ended up where she was, and it also provides a good idea of where she was and how she lived for the 9 months she was gone."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Tue Jun 30 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"I think you're rising a lot of good points. I speculated since the beginning about the terminal illness ; that's was my first feeling. Her surrounding being a factor is an excellent idea as well. Perhaps she didn't wanted her surrounding to feel bad about her suicide and that's why she tried to remain unidentified. Perhaps she knew she had some terminal illness and decided to leave in secrecy until she felt the first symptoms kicked in and that's when she decided to die. Perhaps she didn't wanted autopsy to be performed on her because she didn't wanted her relatives to know about her illness and thus her whereabouts if she was to be identified despite her efforts.   Also, I think the idea that the DNR bracelet was taken from a boarder is a good idea to considerate, but more generally I think it would be worth verifying if this kind of DNR code was legal in Michigan at the time.  http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(chfcqza3blrhel55zqlhr0ml))/documents/mcl/pdf/mcl-Act-193-of-1996.pdf apparently, it isn't legally efficient because it doesn't say ""ORDER"" after ""DNR"". But since this change was passed in february of 1996, perhaps she possessed a bracelet which didn't met the proper legislation from before it was reformed.  EDIT : I have a more consistent theory now. The idea I have is that she learned she had some kind of terminal illness. Knowing her high responsibilities over the group home, she doesn't want the people she works with or care for to slowly see her going away and being unable to carry her daily duties she perceives as extremely important. I bet the group home was like a family to her and that the boarders considered her as family as well, perhaps in a motherly way. I think it is an important reminder that group homes are a close knit environnement encompassing people from differents horizons with sometime no past or family which are provided with such a background they miss. Sure, sharply abandonning them would seem cruel, but perhaps it would sound better to her by leaving the ambiguity of an involuntary disappearance than slowly fading away and seeing the other suffer in consequence, knowing she doesn't had for long.  So she decide to make a diversion, fake a disappearance and roam across the country until she feels the moment came to end her life in a grandiose way.  She wouldn't have necessarily lived in a miserable way though, or used the amtrak network all the time. Since she worked for a group home, she probably has a good understanding of how all these caregiving and shelter-like institution work and could have lived in several similar places during this eight month span. Also, who knows if she didn't already had an experience of drifting and nomadism ? Perhaps she had no ties with her family and originally was a runaway who fled New Jersey to live in Michigan. I bet she received actual drifters in her group home, since young drug addicts in recovery or homeless people in need are also regulars in group homes.  I feel this is the kind of thing which would never appear had voluntary suicide been legal at this time and place. I remember watching as a kid a decade ago a report on assisted suicide, where they featured a french woman which reminded me a lot of the AJD ; same age, same wit and cynicism. She has terminal cancer. So since she can't ""die in dignity"" in France, she travels by train to Switzerland with her daughter, while being filmed by the camera crew. All the trip long. She is severe and determined ; I remember being stunned before such a fatalistic, but dignified, mature attitude before death. So they welcome her to some clinic, give her some med/injection in a special room and close the door until it's finished one hour after. I hope I could find this report again."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,4,Tue Jun 30 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"With regard to the bracelet, the way these are used in the US does vary from state to state, you're right about that. I think the primary purpose of these bracelets is to make the patient's wishes known to anyone who may treat her, rather than to be a binding legal 'document'.  So you're deffo right about that.  A DNR order actually exists within a hospital setting and I'm not sure how or if it's related to these bracelets, to be honest.  These kinds of bracelets (and sometimes necklaces) are available to purchase, sometimes in catalogs. And they are often used to simply convey information to medical care providers, rather than as anything that falls under a legislative or legal umbrella.  But, yeah, a lot of people (including myself) have come to the conclusion that she didn't want anyone to know that she was sick (if she really was) and she didn't want anyone to know she was suicidal.  However, there is still a lot of debate, even on this sub, about whether or not she simply wanted to ""not cause trouble"" for those who knew her, or whether she really, really wanted to guarantee she wouldn't be identified.    This is a big question.  A lot of us have thought long and hard about it, in terms of 'what would AJD want?' kind of a thing.  I'm now totally convinced that we've found our woman. If I could convey anything it would be that I wish we could honor her memory and her life in a respectful and, dare I say, affectionate way.  So many of us, myself included have spent hours and hours thinking about this woman and her death....and her life. Who was she, what was her life like, who cared about her, who did she care about, why was she alone, why Jeff Foxworthy and Monty Python and Mel Brooks, what did her house look like, why did this happen, so many questions.  I just kind of wish, I wish she could know in some kind of way that a lot of people who never even knew her actually do care about her, for lack of a better word.   Its so sad that she died the way she did, and I guess I just don't want to do anything that she wouldn't 'have wanted.'  But at the same time, no one should die alone and cold in a cemetery, unidentified.  Even if she was alone then, she's not alone now. Not by a long shot.   I guess, now that I'm seeing the other pieces of the puzzle, as it were, I feel even sadder about what happened to her. Her life and her death. her suicide.  She's a real person, even more real now. I don't know.   I'm kinda cut up about this, after seeing her picture.  I'm rambling, I don't know."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,grimsb,3,Tue Jun 30 21:38:49 2015 UTC,"I understand. This is quite an ethical conundrum and who knows what she really wished. That's part of the whole mystery too.  My idea is that she didn't wanted to be identified at the moment, due to the context. But after 20 years, I feel whoever knew and cared for her would feel the need of a closure."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,BonnieMacFarlane2,2,Tue Jun 30 22:03:16 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  Also, I feel like this case probably impacted the people who found her, and the people in the area around the cemetery. Part of me thinks that anyone who remembers her case would like to know who she was.  If and unidentified person was found deceased by suicide in the cemetery down the street from my old house, man, that would stay with me, and I would want to know who it was. :/ But maybe I'm just projecting too much. I don't know."

gratefuldoe,3blu08,legends444,2,Tue Jun 30 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"I just read your edit - I think you've got a pretty reasonable theory here.   And what you've said about assisted suicide? I watched a doc on assisted suicide a few weeks ago, having nothing do to with AJD or anything and I immediately thought ""hang on, this reminds me a lot of AJD....""  I do wonder if it's possible to find out more about the group home (Lakeview, I think?) and whether it was for older people or for another 'group' of people.  I was under the impression it was a retirement/convalescent home, but I could be wrong about that.  Your theory does seem really compelling, though."

gratefuldoe,3blu08,TVConefive,2,Wed Jul 1 11:55:21 2015 UTC,"From an operational standpoint, a home for the elderly (a nursing home) is very different from a home for the mentally challenged, and very different from a home for people with drug issues.   These are totally different facilities, at least in the United States, I can't say anything about how things are run in other countries, though.   A group home which cares for older people wouldn't be able to provide care for the people in the other above circumstances, unless they were elderly as well.   My grandfather and both step grandparents lived in group homes for the elderly before their death, and my maternal grandmother is in a group home for the elderly right now.   Also my dad was a mental health nurse/case worker for the state of GA, and worked in group homes for people with mental health issues. They are totally different kinds of environment, for legal, operational and ethical reasons.  I'm having difficulty finding information on ""Jacobs Lakeview Manor"" (where it was reported that she worked.)    I've found a ""Lakeview Manor Home"" in Tawas City, Michigan but I don't know if that's the same as Jacobs Lakeview. It's not that far from Port Austin actually.    Lakeview Manor Home is a a home for the elderly, but I don't know if it was a home for the elderly in 1996? If I had to guess I'd say it was, but I can't be sure.   http://www.cienahealthcare.com/michigan-facilities/lakeview-manor-healthcare-center/ I think this is where she worked, but I can't be totally sure."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,Idontlovethem,3,Wed Jul 1 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"I saw that too. I was wondering if maybe there had been a mix-up on the NAMUS profile; maybe Dona lived in Port Austin but worked in Tawas City.  Tawas City is right across Saginaw Bay from Port Austin. It's close ""as the crow flies"", but the drive around the bay would take over two and a half hours. Unless there's some kind of ferry service, it would be too long of a commute.  So I have to think that back in 1996, there must have been a separate Jacobs Lakeview Manor that was actually in Port Austin."

Although there's definitely a connection between the juice bottle and the juice instructions in the book, I wonder if we're chasing a dead end with the whole juice bottle thing.   EDIT: I wonder if she bought the juice somewhere and held onto it for a while, unopened, while she traveled to find the right place for her to do her act. It's like everything somehow fits into a master plan and has to be as perfect as possible. Obtain valium.

gratefuldoe,3blu08,legends444,4,Tue Jun 30 19:09:35 2015 UTC,"You guys did an excellent job doing your research on this one.  At this point I think your justified in contacting the Case Manager for Dona Thompson. Or the Port Austin Police Department.    Contact The Case Manager:  If you require more information about the missing person, contact the law enforcement department, or case manager, that is handling the case of this person. They will be able to provide you with their understanding of the case, and whether or not they could possibly be the unidentified person. In some cases, the law enforcement department may even submit the missing person for exclusion for you.    Lay out your reasoning, short and sweet. Be sure to explain the height discrepancy issue or they may rule it out just based on that.  I know your not in the U.S. so it presents some difficultly. You had others working with you on this and maybe one of them would like to do this. It can seem intimidating but this is the Case Manager's job. A professional approach and showing an understanding of the facts should convince them to pursue this. If no one want's to I will, but if this is something you would like to do this is a good one to start with.    Heads up to /u/greymetal  and /u/Pastor__of__Muppets"

I can't really make heads nor tales of those sites in terms of focused searches. Did you search by state or 'age' or date of disappearance? And how did you narrow down the search?  I'm just amazed that someone actually found her. Amazed."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,TVConefive,6,Tue Jun 30 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"It was really just a fluke. I had a very strong feeling that AJD would have been missing for less than a year before her death, so I did a Google search for 1996 missing persons. That led me here:  http://www.nampn.org/mp1996Jan-Mar.html (literally the first search result)  Nobody on that page looked promising, so I went on to:  http://www.nampn.org/mp1996Apr-Jun.html  Dona's listed about 1/3 of the way down the page. Her photo seemed almost eerily familiar.  I actually waited a day or so before I posted her profile here, mostly because of the age and height discrepancies. I was second-guessing myself a whole lot. I thought maybe my mind was playing tricks on me, exaggerating the resemblance. But eventually I just couldn't get Dona's profile out of my head, so I figured I'd go ahead and share the link, if only to get some other opinions.   Anyhow... At this point I've spent so much time trying to find more info on Dona that I really want to know what happened to her-- even if she doesn't end up being a match for AJD."

gratefuldoe,3blu08,TVConefive,3,Wed Jul 1 12:47:50 2015 UTC,"I think you should start with something like ""Dona Thompson closely resembles an unidentified deceased woman found in Annandale Va. in 1996. Go into the vitals: Dona was 49, Deceased was reported as 50 to 70. Dona was 5' 4"" to 5'7"", Deceased reported as 5' however 2 different news reports say 5-foot-5. Dona was 160 pounds, Deceased was 157 pounds. Dona's hair was Brown and short, Deceased hair was Auburn and short (possibly dyed). Dona's eye color was Green, no information for eye color of Deceased. Dona wore prescription eyeglasses, Deceased wore prescription eyeglasses.   Deceased had an 8"" abdominal scar. No information like that for Dona however Deceased died 8 months after Dona disappeared.   I'll add more later and wait to see what Naliju comes up with. You really want to see if the case manager agrees that the information and circumstances are close enough to warrant further action."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,ajack652,2,Wed Jul 1 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"I think you abstracted the vitals ! Then, the others factors would be :  *The closeness of the dates  *The seemingly voluntary aspect of Dona's disappearance (by what we know), because she actually went with her van elsewhere than where she indicated she would go and next abandonned (or ditched ?) it.  *The fact her car was found on a city with an amtrak station while the AJD was also in a city near several amtrak stations (knowing amtrak stations aren't everywhere in the US), and the probable fact that the AJD used the amtrak to come to the cemetary, and more geenrally as a mean of transportation. Problem is this part is that it is full of conjectures and ambiguous parts, such as the ""easiness"" to go from Bay City to Annandale using the Amtrak network.   *The possibility that several elements from the AJD, such as the DNR bracelet, the knowledge of the funeral procedures, the obtention of valium, or even the knowledge of the concept of Jane Doe for unidentified decedents, match with the fact she would have worked in a healthcare background, such as a group home. (I don't know if we should mention some of our speculations about the possibility she went into such institutions to live a nomadic life for eight months)  *I don't know if we should mention our speculations about Dona's and AJD's psychology though, especially without falling in cinematographic clichés. But the overall ideas is that both seemed to be strong minded women with an inflexible determination in what they were doing (Dona for her extensive work and age context, the AJD for her suicide, her note and its context).  I probably forgot a bunch of them, so add everything you deem important here !"
gratefuldoe,3blu08,grimsb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:26:06 2015 UTC,"*The closeness of the dates   Yes   *The seemingly voluntary aspect of Dona's disappearance    Yes  I think we should leave the rest out initially. If she would ask for more ""evidence"" or appears to be sincerely interested in what else we have I would add that. That's my opinion but I really think you, /r/grimsb and who ever else worked on this should decide.   I would also include asking her if Dona had a terminal illness and does she know if Dona had a scar on her abdomen.   The whole idea is to get her to seriously look at this. So whatever you think that would take."
gratefuldoe,3blu08,zombiegrey,2,Thu Jul 2 11:34:04 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. The possibility the AJD worked in a healtcare setting seems a pretty strong argument to me.

gratefuldoe,3bkkc2,TVConefive,2,Tue Jun 30 07:31:14 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is really good!   I have a big theory about FCJD, because I grew up in Atlanta, was in town when this happened, and FCJD was probably only about 5-7 years older than me. (if he was early 20's)  I am pretty much convinced he was in the area for the concert that was on at Lakewood that night, he took the local (crappy) public transportation to get to the gig, and because the train station is on the wrong side of the highway and he was on foot, he tried to cross 75/85 on foot, and was struck by a vehicle before he ever reached the concert.  (He was found on the southbound/western side of the highway, and the train station is to the west of the highway.)  Here's a quick and dirty map I made of the route FCJD (who I really want to call Lakewood/Kyuss John Doe, but that's just me) took from the MARTA station to try and walk to Lakewood.  http://imgur.com/M6nk5Ub  Now, a bit about the social/socioeconomics of Atlanta in 1995: The area he was found in is very 'racially segregated' and a white person or non-black person wouldn't be likely to be in that area for any other reason than to go to Lakewood.    I went to 3 or 4 shows there in the early 90's and. As 'un-pc' as it sounds, the racial makeup of the metro Atlanta area, especially back then, is such that a white person wouldn't be in that area unless he had a compelling reason to be there, like the Kyuss/Reverend Horton Heat/Babes in Toyland/White Zombie show that was on that night.  (I also have some theories about where he was from based on his tattoo, and I think his tattoo is the key that will reveal his identity, but that's for another time....)"
gratefuldoe,3bkkc2,Idontlovethem,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:13:53 2015 UTC,"I know it's been discussed before but what do you think the reasoning is that he didn't use the pedestrian bridge?

Un-PC or not it's reality and needs to be put out there.  I can't wait to hear your theories on the tattoos!"
gratefuldoe,3bkkc2,dragthewaters91,3,Tue Jun 30 22:40:25 2015 UTC,"I think he didn't know it was there, and if he did, it's not easy to access. Atlanta is not designed for pedestrians by any means.   166 actually goes over the road that runs perpendicular to the ped bridge. And, he didn't have an overhead map, like we're looking at now, so he wouldn't have been able to map out how to safely cross 75/85. He would have been walking 'as the crow flies' kind of, and going on 'how do I get there' directions. If he had asked someone at the station they would have pointed to 166 and said, 'get the bus there, if one shows up', they wouldn't have given him directions to a ped bridge. Trust me it's not that kind of neighborhood. Not at all.   The Marta station is actually called ""Lakewood Fort McPherson"" station.   He probably thought it was easy to get from Lakewood Station to Lakewood Amphitheater. It's actually not, there are busses but they're ridiculously unreliable.   When you look at the route from the Marta Station to lakewood, there is no indication, to a person in the area,  that a pedestrian bridge even exists.   In order to access the pedestrian bridge, you would have to 1. Know the bridge exists, and 2. Know the area well enough to know how to get to the bridge.    He would have walked the easiest, simplest 'How do I get to Lakewood from here' route. The ped bridge is only accessible by going through what looks like an industrial area or a shopping area, and in order to get there he would have to get down to the road that runs under 166.   I've spent hours as a car-less teenager (and adult) in Atlanta trying to figure out how to get from one place to another. Atlanta is the least pedestrian friendly city I've lived in in the states.  Long story short, he didn't know how to access the ped bridge, might not have even known it was there, especially if it if it was dark when he was walking."

It happens a lot, and I'd say at least one person in each family has done it.  That being said, I sincerely hope they did an in depth check of the van. All information helps."
gratefuldoe,3be4y7,HorriblyCrazy,3,Mon Jun 29 09:55:09 2015 UTC,"I think ruling out mechanical failure would be part of a normal accident investigation. As someone who is constantly tired, I also dont think it would be unusual to fall asleep at the wheel at 1:30 PM. Just think of how often people fall asleep in class, in meetings, or on the bus. He had been driving for hours, which can be very monotonous and boring, and we dont know how much sleep he got the night before. If he was freaking out and hallucinating you would imagine GD would have tried to grab the wheel, but GD's fingerprints were not on the wheel.  Personally I think the ""faded tattoo"" is faded Sharpie.  Nice username BTW."
gratefuldoe,3be4y7,dragthewaters91,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:35:13 2015 UTC,"Sharpie is an excellent possibility, given where he was coming from! I hadn't even thought about that.  It's also a valid point that GD may have tried to intervene if Eric was freaking out or hallucinating, unless he was sleeping? There are so many what if's. This case is just really nagging at me, and I'm trying to look at every possibility.  Thanks for the username compliment too. ;)"

I have such a hard time seeing a deadhead bear even though that's really what I wanted to see. I'll take a look at it again, because that would make so much sense. I personally have one of those ""scratcher"" tattoos that I wish would fade. ;)  Eta iirc Eric was a good kid. But that doesn't rule out drugs, and help came fairly soon after?"

I can spend some time today working on our guide to make it a bit easy and shorter for people to breeze through.  As for the what are people doing etc, we do have a section on that in each of the Google Docs. Perhaps for each case, I could also set up a thread when I set up the initial post about it and link to it in the initial post. In that thread people can comment on what they are doing, and what they might need help with.  That should become much easier too once we have the time to get group work organized too."

When someone dies in an accident, old age or disease, its final. When someone goes missing it is different. Although it only took a few weeks to locate my dad, we couldn't help but wonder if he took off, was hurt somewhere or dead. So many people come to help, but they have there own lives to back to. And when your told he may never be located is really difficult. I kind of understand in a way why some people are not reported missing.

And I will never forget all the amazing people that spent hundreds of hours trying to bring GD home. From the Virginia ME's office, to the people at Doe Network and NamUS, to the media outlets that covered his case (especially David Lohr from the Huffington Post!) to of course all the devoted volunteers and internet sleuths and even anyone who shared the posts on Reddit or Facebook...and OF COURSE most of all, all of you amazing people on this sub and /u/zombiegrey. You guys are an inspiration and truly show the power of human kindness and perseverance. I wish someday to have my shit together enough to do what you guys do on a consistent basis.  Without you guys GD would have been a forgotten file and box of ashes in the medical examiner's office. Now, although he was robbed of the chance for a future, your perseverance has possibly allowed him to regain his past, and for his family to have closure.  Not to get all hippie but I hope that somewhere in the universe, Jason/GD and Eric know that they are remembered by so many people, and the legacy that they left behind.

I will be thinking about Grateful Doe, Jason Callahan and Michael Eric Hager today, as well as their families.

gratefuldoe,3b2nwu,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jun 25 17:25:37 2015 UTC,"Aww, I thought you were for some reason! Although, there is way more to metal than just Slayer. Unlike JCD (but possibly like FCJD who may have been at a Kyuss show!) Im more of a sludge/stoner/groove metal person myself.  We are opposites in that case...I love metal but fail at dressing like a metalhead and end up looking like a crazy hippie wearing four different mismatched prints at once.  So now Im curious...what made you so interested in JCD specifically then, if not the metal thing?"
gratefuldoe,3b2nwu,dragthewaters91,3,Thu Jun 25 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"Dunno, JCD reconstruction reminds me of a friend of mine, also he was so young ! I get the vibe that he was a loner - in sense that when you're a teenage metalhead in the rural midwest at a time where metal was highly controversial, you Probably stick to your habits and pals. I really sympathise with the guy. Sure, Who knows who he really was outside these mere bones. But I feel he just was a kid in his raging teens who met bad luck and has family and friends wondering where he is."

gratefuldoe,3b0dnw,Naliju,2,Wed Jun 24 23:23:16 2015 UTC,I have a small list of UIDs I really want to see solved one day and 1117umoh is on it. Those kids must be missing him something terrible and want to know what happened to their father. So sad to think about it.  I see 745umwi was carrying a butter knife in his possession when he was found. That's a little odd.
gratefuldoe,3b0dnw,heart-shaped-fawkes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:51:09 2015 UTC,"I wondered if he was indeed the father, since he seemed to be so young...  EDIT : odd, didn't read this detail. You can't really defend yourself with a butter knife, can you ? Perhaps he used it for some unknown task. Or perhaps he found it somewhere and picked it out of curiosity. If you knew the weird crap I find in the wilderness or the street and I pick up sometimes... EDIT 2 : perhaps as part of an unlocking set ? He was speculated to be a burglar. Or did I played too much skyrim lately..."
gratefuldoe,3b0dnw,heart-shaped-fawkes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:21:20 2015 UTC,I assumed the children were probably young and the mother or another family member wrote the note. If he were 20 he could easily have toddlers and just be a teen father.  I was almost wondering if he could have been using it to pick/pry something but there are so many other things you could use for that purpose that would be better. If it were a protection thing I'd certainly think he'd carry something a little pointier. Pretty bizarre.

Thanks for sharing /u/callievic  As well as being Canada Day, July 1st could've been the day that she was killed. So whoever buried her buried the paper as a clue of some sort to show when she died maybe? DoeNetwork stated that the woman could have been dead up to a year before she was found...could that tie in with July 1st the previous year?  You mentioned that you didn't think that it as suicide because of the victims hair but people have all sorts of thoughts going through their heads before killing themselves, some not rational.   Whoever found her may have panicked (Maybe she was found in a hotel room and the owner panicked) and thought that it was best to bury her in this way or else the person who found this woman was broke and couldn't give her a proper burial. Just thinking out aloud.  Edited to add: It may have been the victims child who shot her because he/she snapped and buried her this way out of guilt and remorse? Or it may have been a jealous lover?  I remember reading somewhere that usually if a victim has their face covered, then it means the murderer knew or was very close to the victim and covered her face because of guilt and also to depersonalize the victim.  I noticed on the Unresolved Mysteries subreddit that most of the theories I wrote here, were already discussed..I guess I am late coming to the party lol."

gratefuldoe,3ars87,bootscallahan,2,Tue Jun 23 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"I had a very infuriating experience this weekend. My wife (age 29) had a stroke on April 20. She has been away from work recovering ever since. One co-worker has been an absolute angel this whole time. She set up a GoFundMe page for medical bills, brought food over, etc. Friday she asked if she and her fiancée (also a co-worker) could bring dinner and have a social night (my wife's first in two months). I'd never met the fiancée but heard he used to have a bad drug problem. So I made sure to move all my wife's medications to the bedroom just in case. They came over and we had a great time. It turns out that he was in the same Army unit as me an we had lots of mutual friends from the service. Then my wife's friend said she wanted to use her e-cigarette. We told her it was okay, but her fiancée insisted she not ""disrespect"" our house and instead vape on the patio. We gave up and followed her to the patio. He volunteered to stay in the house to clean up the food and do the dishes. He took about 20 minutes.     Sunday we noticed 10 Lortab pills were missing from her brand new prescription . . . that was on her nightstand in our closed bedroom. We covered every possible explanation and realized he convinced us to go outside while he volunteered to do the dishes inside. That son of a bitch stole pain medication from my wife, who has had a continuous headache since April 17 due to severe brain clots. Then he shook my hand and said it was great meeting me. I'm livid but my wife doesn't want to lose her best friend at work. We can't prove it and she (eventually) will have to work closely with both of them either way. It's just so frustrating. I purposely moved the pills to the bedroom so as not to tempt a recovering addict. Then I met him and felt bad because he seemed completely normal. Then he went into our closed bedroom and searched through the dozen bottles before finding the jackpot. What a bastard."
gratefuldoe,3ars87,Idontlovethem,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:42:34 2015 UTC,"ugh. That sounds absolutely awful. I don't know what to say other than that I'm infuriated on your behalf. What an utter, utter betrayal of trust. You let this guy into your house, giving him the benefit of the doubt and he does something like this, especially when you and your wife are going through such a difficult time?  Infuriating.  I've been betrayed by addicts and recovering addicts before, too. As much as you want to be 'kind and helpful', after you've had things stolen from you time and time and time again, it becomes too much to bear. It's awful when something like this happens, it makes it so difficult to 'trust' people."
gratefuldoe,3ars87,ArtsyOwl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:59:36 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry that happened.   My mom had something similar happen years ago. She's a psychologist and generally keeps the necessary distance, but she became very close with a woman who was a recovering addict. She attended the birth of her daughter, as a friend, we had dinner at her house, she brought her family to our house for dinner occasionally, we were all close. Until one day my mom realized that she was missing some medication. She was heart broken. To be honest, we all were. But we forgave her. Addiction can be so strong... The addict isn't necessarily being disgenuine, when they interact with you. The act of stealing is a sad, sometimes spur of the moment gesture.   Sorry, my son is piling cars in my lap so I lost my train of thought, but what I'm saying is that he probably didn't want to do it. He's an addict. I'm not saying to forgive him, just trying to provide some reassurance that when he said it was nice to meet you and enjoyed your company, it was probably genuine.   I personally would confront him. Leaving that to fester could be bad. And you might stop him from spiraling. But, I don't know all the facts etc."

I hate it when I hear people taking advantage of others' kindness and I hope that karma will give him a kick up the backside soon enough.  You are right...what a bastard! As BashfulBee said It maybe a good idea to confront him, because it is not good to let that anger linger inside you.  I hope your wife is recovering well?"

She's going to have to work with the both of them when she goes back to work. She's had enough stress these last two months. She is recovering well though. Two months ago, she was still in ICU. Now her vision is almost 100% (she had to have surgery to relieve pressure on her optic nerve) and her headache isn't as bad as it was. She's expected to make a full recovery. She had brain clots (sinus venous thrombosis) as a side effect of hormonal birth control and that caused the stroke. The good news is that strokes caused by that don't typically result in paralysis on one side of the body. It's just a freak thing, but it'll soon be in the past."

The way a DNA chromatogram works they should have been able to assess sequence quality right after sequencing.

Do they have any plans to do that.    The law is going to vary by state but most likely it will require a court  order. In this case, I imagine they would need a strong suspicion of his identity before even considering it.

Something tells me that most of the exclusions that have happened recently, through our submissions, may have been based on circumstances alone, and not DNA exclusion. However, it begs the question, how were all of the exclusions before we started looking at this case excluded? Does it then make their exclusions null?

gratefuldoe,39uxoi,cinnyc,5,Mon Jun 15 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"yep, we both agree about this.  The round amount of the money seems really deliberate, like someone really thought  it out and gave it to her for a reason.  I wondered if it was given to her before she left wherever she came from, like someone said 'good luck in your new life in Albuquerque' but I agree, it very well could have come from the person she went to Albuquerque to see.  Once you suggested the 'take this money and please go away' theory, my mind really changed, and I think you're right.   If it was a father that she had tracked down, maybe he wanted to keep her existence a secret or something, and that would explain why he washed his hands of her and there are no missing persons reports.   The 'dad who wanted nothing to do with her' theory sounds like a good one.  In fact, it seems really, really plausible. And sad."
gratefuldoe,39uxoi,hollyinnm,5,Tue Jun 16 13:45:47 2015 UTC,I think the money was drug related. There was a scale found at the scene and she had heroine or morphine in her system. I forget which.

She fell into the drug business and one day she realized that what she was into was just too much. She sat and drank a few beers, thought about it.... Decided there was only one way out.   Another user has found someone who looks to be a very good match for George Martinez. They found a mug shot. Between that, the drug scale, the opiates in her system... It seems pretty clear that she was at least marginally involved."

Was he found on I-75 near 166 (near Lakewood Amphitheater) or was he found on I-75 near Moore's Mill Road?   If he was found near Moore's Mill Road, then that changes a lot.

gratefuldoe,39uxhm,Idontlovethem,3,Mon Jun 15 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I grew up in Atlanta and went to 3 or 4 shows in the early nineties at Lakewood.  The only time a white person or non-black person is in that area, is to go to a concert.  Atlanta is really racially segregated in places, and this is definitely an area where a white guy wouldn't just be walking down the road. And the only reason to be crossing the highway, is if you don't really know what you're doing and you're desperate to get somewhere.   I'm now pretty much convinced he was either going to or coming from the Kyuss/RHH/White Zombie/Babes in Toyland concert.  Those bands are pretty niche, and Atlanta and Athens are probably the only places they would play in the Georgia/Tennessee area.  If someone was a fan who didn't live in Atlanta, he'd have to go to Atlanta or Athens to see them, and it would probably be a big deal.    I've been staring at a map of the area and I think he may have taken the MARTA (Atlanta Public Transport/trains) train to the Lakewood Station, gotten off there, and then tried to walk to the Amphitheater.  He obviously didn't have a car, and Marta is the only way to get around Metro Atlanta without a car, and the trains are way more reliable and easy to use than the busses. I rode Marta for years growing up.)  The Marta station is on the other side of 75/85, and I can totally imagine him trying to get there on foot. (There are busses to the amphitheater but, like I mentioned, they're spotty, and it's only a mile or so away.)  Looking at 166, which crosses 75/85, there's a big mess of on ramps and off ramps, so I can see pretty clearly where he could have gotten off the train, walked down to 166, tried to walk along 166, then taken an 'off ramp' on foot that put him right on the wrong side of 75/85.    I can see where he could have easily tried to cross over 75/85 - Lakewood is literally just on the other side of the freeway.  I had forgotten there was a Marta station near Lakewood, and when I remembered that, I was like 'yep, walking from Marta to Lakewood.'    The Lakewood area is almost entirely African American, and really low income. It was in 1995 and is probably still today.    I'm convinced the only reason he was in the area was for the concert, and he crossed the freeway to get to the venue, because he had taken our (crappy) public train service to get to the show.  I'm working on a rudimentary map of my 'hypothesis' of where he came from and where he was going to and how he ended up being hit.   **EDIT: It's not the easiest map to read, but this shows the area where FCJD was found, and the route from the Marta Train station to the Lakewood Amphitheater that he could have taken on foot.  (From experience, I can say that sometimes if you need to get somewhere in the Metro area, you just have to hoof it.)  Map with hypothetical route - http://imgur.com/M6nk5Ub"

HE WILL HAVE MUSIC WHEREVER HE GOES. DON""T FUCK WITH THE DRAGONS""  I always wondered if the text wasn't indeed the last rambling of a suicidal man, but bearer of some significant undertext. ""The dragons"" could refer to the expression ""chasing the dragons"" for drugs addicts, but I also wondered if it wasn't the name of a gang he could have fled from."

gratefuldoe,39ot9o,Naliju,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"Well, he was wearing gloves when he died and probably had blood on his toes. Music wherever he goes could indicate either sounds in his head or just general liking to music. Dragons I think could indicate either drugs or other medication.   The note 'could have been wanted out of Canada' is an interesting twist. This basically means he would have been an immigrant (to Canada).   I vote for this one as well, though if this guy has anything to do with drugs/mafia the case might be cold for good."

gratefuldoe,39ot9o,Naliju,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, East Asians hardly ever circumcise, and he's complexion/appearance is not of South Asian (Indian/Sri Lankan, Cambodian).

gratefuldoe,39ot9o,ArtsyOwl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my feeling too, but who knows. Perhaps this case must be publicized to the specific S/E Asian communities in the US and Canada. I'm sure somebody would recognize him, especially for the birthmarks and scars. But perhaps it's gang related and far more problematic than expected. I kind of feel bad such an apparent young person can't get a name on him, even if he was (probably ?) into crime activity (but then why the police can't identify him ? Should Canadians mughsot be looked for ? etc.)"
gratefuldoe,39ot9o,Naliju,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"The note reminds me of the old nursery rhyme ""Ride A Cock Horse to Banbury Cross""...I assume this rhyme is known in the US, is it?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_a_cock_horse_to_Banbury_Cross"

Ride a cock-horse to Banbury Cross, To see a fine lady upon a white horse; Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, And she shall have music wherever she goes  u/ArtsyOwl this is a great discovery, thanks !!  Edit 2 : odd that such a twenty years or so vagrant from south eastern asian origin could not only know such an ancient english rhyme, but indeed probably knowing it full and using it as his last epitaph. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but for me this guy was definitely cultivated and well versed on the whole poetry/(music ?) thing. In all cases, he definitely was an oddball.   Apparently, the poem was used in a seventies famous Nicholson's film called ""Five Easy Piece"" (I never watched it personally) perhaps this is how he learned the rhyme ? The film though was released in 1970, and since our doe was twenty something or so in 1994, he would have been born or just be a kid when the film was released. I think it definitely is a clue to consider."
gratefuldoe,39ot9o,ArtsyOwl,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:41:57 2015 UTC,"Hi. Glad to be of some help to you!  I have no idea either, as to how a South Eastern Asian could know this poem, unless his father or mother studied in England, maybe they studied historical literature or else he did himself..although I doubt it. Most of these Rhymes have great historical meanings attached to them.  I am not sure whether it helps the case to know this but, when I was younger all of these ancient nursery rhymes were published in several books for kids which were very popular, although that happened in England mostly (and Ireland too). If he lived in England at one point or was very well read, he may have come across a nursery rhyme book. I came across plenty of those books as a kid, with that Banbury Cross poem in it (I was 14 in 1994-so it maybe possible?)  Its like this John Doe changed the rhyme to a more Asian meaning-and that is why he included Dragons instead?? Just a crazy thought here.   I never heard of that movie Five Easy Pieces?  But sure it is possible he got the rhyme from this film instead."
gratefuldoe,39ot9o,Naliju,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Another thing to consider is that The Dragons are maybe a gang? The line: Blood on his toes makes me think of kung fu-although that is more of Chinese thing. Hmm..I am probably going way off track, but I am just thinking out aloud as usual lol."
gratefuldoe,39ot9o,bootscallahan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"Neither until I made these research (I'm quite a movie goer myself, but not especially into this kind of film). I don't think the dragons has a more ""sacred"" meaning, since it appears quite abruptly at the end with the world ""fuck"", contrasting with the rest. First I thought it had something to do with hard drugs (""don't fuck with drugs or you will end like me"" since there is a famous expression regarding some drugs : ""chasing the dragon""), but next I wondered if it wasn't more simply ""fucking with the wrong people"" --> ""don't fuck with this gang called ""the dragons"".   Indonesian culture at my knowledge is under the influence of many other cultures, mainly a mix between arab/muslim culture and hindu/buddhist culture from earlier influence, and some east asian and chinese influence as well. I don't know how far dragons fit in the Indonesian/malay culture though, especially among people of muslims descent. I thought it could be either the metaphora of a gang or the real name of, say, an east asian gang called ""the dragons"" he could have fled from after a conundrum or a debt.   The odd thing is that there is not much of a big Indonesian/Malay emigration in the US nor in Canada. I don't think he was himself an immigrant, not only because he seemed to spoke well english but because he seemed to be familiar with not even US culture but what seemed to be classical english culture. I think he only was on Indo/Malay descent. I also considered he could be an English or Australian citizen of east asian descent who immigrated to the US as well. He could have been a student as well. The possibilities are nearly endless.  Perhaps I'm wrong but apart from the fact he was circumcised, nothing seems to indicate he was a lot into religion (if he was, I don't think he wouldn't have commited suicide, or let such a note), he could have been an american or canadian citizen of muslim descent but which didn't identified himself as religious. I think that asking somebody familiar with indonesian/malay culture or I/M communities in the US/Canada could be important (as well as asking a metalhead about JCD led to many important clues about who he could have been).   EDIT : doing some researchs on Indo or Malay emigration in the US led to some interesting results : http://ask.metafilter.com/251247/Why-are-there-so-few-Indonesian-immigrants-in-America  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_American  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Canadian  http://www.aiisf.org/stories-by-author/767-from-malaysia-to-the-united-states  I think the possibility that he was an international student abroad is to be considered."

When someone passes away, they may have a set of wishes. When they die, it's no longer their choice if those wishes will be granted.  For example, I worked on a decedent who wanted to be buried naked. It was a very serious request of theirs. They even put it in their prearrangements for their funeral.  Their wishes were ultimately ignored by their family, who did not think it was proper.  Was that right? A lot of us believed it was not. But their family had final say. Ultimately, they paid for the funeral and the person who paid had the final say.  My point being, Jane Doe may have had wishes. She may not have wanted to be identified. But she took her own life and in doing that and dying, she gave up control of her case.   She tried to control it by leaving money. But that money would not have been enough to cover the fees for cremation, paperwork, death certificates and cold storage. There would be an outstanding balance on her case exceeding that of what she left. That outstanding balance would have fallen to her family, had she not been a Jane Doe.   Her family would have been the people who decided her disposition. If she died with a set of wishes, fulfilling them would be up to her family.  If we look at it through that lens, it would ultimately be up to her family (or if she were a public fiduciary case, someone else) whether or not she is identified - not her."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,happenstanced,5,Thu Jun 11 15:47:29 2015 UTC,"I think that's the important thing to remember--she is no longer with us. But people looking for her may still be. And honestly, I feel that the living take priority over the wishes of the dead. Someone knew her, someone loved her, but depression may have clouded her judgment too far to see that. She may have very well thought she was alone, but no one truly is. We cannot know for sure her state of mind or motives, but we can find the living who are able to express those things, including the desire for answers.  We can do this respectfully in order to find and provide an answer to the ones she left behind, rather than simply solving a mystery to solve a mystery."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,talienfey,6,Fri Jun 12 15:01:11 2015 UTC,I was going to say something similar but you stated it perfectly. I totally agree.  I feel that it is totally noble to want to respect what one believes are the wishes of the deceased but she is dead now. She no longer experiences pain or anger or sadness or fear or doubt. There is a very good possibility that she left behind people who are experiencing those emotions due to her disappearance.   We have the ability to possibly assuage some of those emotions that they are having and I think that is just as noble.

She obviously planned her suicide meticulously and did not want to be identified, but I feel like there's so much in her situation that I can't just write off. It's the details like the mini Christmas tree and the comedy cassettes that drew me into this case initially. Though she wished to remain anonymous, the way she constructed her death made her an object of interest, mystery, and speculation. It's sad to think that she is likely getting more attention anonymously in death than she did at the end of her life.  I feel that if there's a single soul anywhere who she might be connected to, they deserve to know what happened. Maybe there isn't anyone out there and maybe that's part of the reason she chose to end her life. Anyway, I can't say whether it's right or wrong to dig any deeper into this case.

gratefuldoe,39fbcx,chainsaw_abortion,3,Fri Jun 12 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"While I find this case fascinating, I have to agree with /u/plastic_venus. My first thought was ""why are we investigating someone who clearly did not want to be known?"", especially when we could be focusing on a case where the victim did not try to remain anonymous. As a nursing student, I highly value autonomy and to me it is clear that AJD put in place great measures to remain unidentified. However, I can also see where /u/bashfullbee is coming from in regards to providing closure to family/loved ones (assuming she had family). It really is an ethical dilemma, and I am not sure there is a correct answer as there are so many varying opinions.

gratefuldoe,39fbcx,thedeejus,5,Thu Jun 11 13:18:35 2015 UTC,Interesting - I'm also in the medical field. I wonder if that concept of body autonomy we have so firmly and repeatedly emphasised plays a part here.

What it comes back to though, is the same question I have raised in this post already:  Who is to say, that all our other does, where there has been no question of ethics, did not also want to remain unidentified?  What would they have said, if they had written a note?"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,TVConefive,5,Thu Jun 11 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying and  you're right - there is wriggle room with the others as to whether they may or may not have wanted to be ID'd. Given that wriggle room I think it's reasonable to pursue it for the sake of the family. But in this particular case there is no question about what this Doe wanted. There's no grey area - we are unequivocally choosing to go against her wishes. My dilemma is whether, given the potential positives of ID'ing her, it's worth it.   Edit: running with the medical theme here, then - if I attend a patient in cardiac arrest and the family says she has terminal cancer and is in awful pain but has no DNR and they really want me to save her I will, even though there's a good bet the patient would rather I didn't. If the same patient had the same family who wanted me to save her but there was a DNR there I wouldn't do it. I know it's a shaky analogy because of the legalities, but I think the foundation comparison is sound - when you're not sure what the patient (or the deceased here) wants you try your best to help them or their family. When the patient had made it clear what they want you do that every time, even if there's a weeping family member begging you to do otherwise. It's also possible I should stop Redditing past midnight ;)"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,TVConefive,3,Thu Jun 11 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow phone typist! It really is hard to write a cohesive post on mobile isn't it? If it's any consolation you pulled it off!  Anyway, how about this thought: If she wasn't leaving anyone behind who might know (and possibly love her) then why worry about being identified? Someone knew her. Maybe she didn't want them to have to be burdened with her body. But maybe they would have wanted that chance."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,suzyclueless,5,Thu Jun 11 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, don't worry, I'm right there with you. I feel the exact same way."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,TVConefive,4,Thu Jun 11 10:21:43 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, Doctor - The same brush could be used to paint any unidentified person case in which they took their own life.  Take ABQ Jane Doe for example; Committed suicde in a area that she was not known in, with all of her belongings, excluding anything that would identity her, with no note.  We can never be certain with any case that we explore that the person did, or did not, want to be unidentified - And that is the risk that we take.   We took on the case of Annandale Jane Doe after discussion with members, and based on the fact that it has been the #1 case requested on this sub since it's inception.  I don't believe that anybody here has questionable motives, and that is why I love you all so much, so we certainly need to look at the reasons why this case has been suggested, and why it is being explored, from various viewpoints to gain a greater understanding."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,suzyclueless,2,Thu Jun 11 13:00:08 2015 UTC,"It's not that I doubt the motives of the people who do this sort of thing. If anything, lurking in this sub I've bee impressed at how respectful and nice folks are. I just feel that the mission of the group in this case is overshadowing the explicit wishes of the individual they're investigating."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,Idontlovethem,2,Thu Jun 11 10:33:02 2015 UTC,"Wow weird I just read about this Jane Doe and had actually thought the same thing, searched the sub, found this thread and couldn't believe how recent it was!    I agree with bits and pieces of what everyone has had to say. I wonder why she didn't want to be identified though? Because the way she set up her death she made it ""mysterious"" meaning people would obviously try and investigate. If she really wanted to just slip off the radar and be forgotten she should have just done it in her home. A suicide in a house probably raises no suspicion as opposed to all the work she put into it.    Also lastly - dumb question - why wouldn't they be able to figure out who she is by realising a house is now empty and no one is paying the bills etc? Unless she lived in a share house or was homeless I don't know. But yeah something I have always wondered is if the bills stopped being paid or a landlord came out to see why their tenant had stopped paying the rent wouldn't you be able to put 2 and 2 together and realise ""Oh Mary is missing and a body turned up!""    someone who knows police workings/crime stuff better than me please reply!"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,Idontlovethem,2,Fri Jun 12 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"Because the way she set up her death she made it ""mysterious"" meaning people would obviously try and investigate.    People keep saying this, but like I outlined above, this just isn't (in general) how suicidal people operate. I don't think she did it that way to be mysterious - I think the scene she set had an emotional significance to her which she wanted to identify with as she died.   If she really wanted to just slip off the radar and be forgotten she should have just done it in her home. A suicide in a house probably raises no suspicion as opposed to all the work she put into it.    Dead bodies smell. People almost inevitably catch on and authorities are called (I've found many a dead body for this exact reason). I think the reasons for not doing it at home are twofold: that would make her identifiable, and for the emotional reasons I mentioned above.   Unless she lived in a share house or was homeless I don't know   I'd say that's the most likely scenario. Or she may have just been renting a place that the landlord assumed she abandoned and just re-let out after a while. It's also possible that she came from a whole other state entirely so ay landlord wouldn't have even been aware of the found body in conjunction with the missing tenant."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,Idontlovethem,2,Fri Jun 12 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"may I ask what it is you do that puts you into a position to find ""many"" dead bodies?"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,dragthewaters91,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:21:30 2015 UTC,"Paramedicine and emergency medical retrieval. We're generally sent to do welfare checks on folks or go along with the police when they're doing one. So when the old lady down the street hasn't been seen form a while or the landlord hasn't had rent for a while or there's a weird smell coming from the apartment downstairs we often end up there, if only for a brief moment. Prior to that I worked in mental health and did some welfare checks in that capacity too, although the dead ones in those situations were usually pretty freshly dead."
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,zombiegrey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:45:03 2015 UTC,"oh interesting. So I have an off topic question my husband and I have been throwing around.   The two girls who lived above us moved out last week but just realized one of their cars is still here. We haven't heard a sound upstairs, and he joked ""what if she's dead"" yesterday. She'd be um, stinking by now, right? Or should I call someone?"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,dragthewaters91,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:45:29 2015 UTC,"Levels of stinkiness has a few factors - time, temperature, house/apartment insulation - but after a week it's a safe bet you'd be smelling something. I'd just knock and see if anyone answers and if not mention it the landlord. If it's not a landlord situation it's perfectly reasonable to call the non-emergency police line and let them know of your concerns"
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,dragthewaters91,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:05:12 2015 UTC,I think I'll go knock this afternoon. The car hasn't moved but maybe they plan to come back for it later. Thanks for entertaining my silly question.
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,TVConefive,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:20:28 2015 UTC,It's not a weird question. It's one of those moments where natural human concern knocks up against the weird western social norms of 'minding our own business'. More concern is only a good thing.
gratefuldoe,39fbcx,zombiegrey,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:03:20 2015 UTC,"My husband and I both suck at minding our own business. I'm pretty sure no one else has noticed their car. But we live in one of those gated complexes where people look down their nose at each other if they look at all. But not us, we know what everyone is doing. Because we spend all day bitching about them. We really need to live out in the forest somewhere miles away from people so only the deer have to hear our version of ""get off my lawn!"".  So anyway, I just went up there and there was no answer so I emailed the manager. Hopefully this won't end up being in the news."

gratefuldoe,38wj39,Idontlovethem,2,Sun Jun 7 12:50:15 2015 UTC,"Great work on this Google Document, very well done.  I noticed in one of the 'theories' someone supposed AJD may have been pregnant.  I read through the medical examiner's report, and it was very thorough and made no mention of a pregnancy (the report did mention internal organs and genitalia.)  This case has really stayed with me.  AJD looks like someone I could have known, her face is really familiar to me.  I know that the ME supposed that AJD was 30 years old, but to my eye and based on my the photograph, if it was recent, I think she was younger than 25.    I can often place people's ages relative to my own at the time a picture was taken, and for some reason, I think she was 23-26, but not older than that.    This is just speculation on my part, of course. I remember going to high school with a couple of girls who looked a lot older than they really were, and this girl reminds me a lot of them.  Also, if I was to suppose a theory on who she is, (I thought about her a lot, actually,) I have an idea that she may have been in the foster care system.  for some reason, I think that may explain why she wasn't reported as missing.    I wonder if pining her age down to less than 25, that may help.   If she was in high school in the late 80's that may help with yearbook searches."
gratefuldoe,38wj39,cinnyc,3,Wed Jun 10 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"This strikes me as very possible. If she had been through the foster care system, she may not have a network of caring family to report her missing or steer her away form self destructive behaviour (possible heroin traces in blood).  Maybe she thought she'd found her father, and was turned away, making her feel helpless and discouraged. I wouldn't take much to push someone with depression and drug abuse habits to feel like they had nowhere to turn. I think there was more than one person there, but he left (the beer bottles). She didn't plan for this all to go this way (tool of convenience used, strap from suitcase), but after an emotional heartbreak, and unbalanced mental state possibly related to drug abuse (withdrawal, lack of supply, helplessness) she sat ruminating on what she had gone through in life, the crappy hand she was dealt and a lack of support that she valued. Maybe she did have foster family, but she'd had a rough time growing through her teens and adulthood so her disappearance was not surprising enough to report it.  It's sad to me, because I've known people who could have met those circumstances but didn't..."
gratefuldoe,38wj39,Idontlovethem,2,Thu Jun 11 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"What you've proposed seems like a reasonable scenario, and scarily close to what I was thinking.  What struck me, and was most chilling, was how effervescent and full of life she looked in the photograph.   I feel like she was hopeful and optimistic when that picture was taken, and she felt really close with the guy in the picture.  The overall vibe I get from the picture is friends.  I don't know, I just feel like they liked each other, but there may not have been anything romantic going on.   What I remember of the kids I went to school with who were in the foster system, (or living with relatives because their parents were in jail or gone for some reason) is that they really reached out for connection. And when they found someone they connected with, it was really important, like they'd found family or something. That's the vibe I get from this picture.  I've thought so much about AJD, honestly.    Your observations about the beer bottles, and then the 'reaction to a heartbreak,' and what may have happened is almost exactly what I was thinking.  Some people supposed she may very well have been a prostitute, but the ME report made no mention of recent sexual activity, and to be honest, i think she wasn't 'turning tricks' in that hotel room.  Why do I think that? Her suitcase. She had a suitcase.  A suitcase.  Something about that suitcase made me think she really was just staying there for a night, or was on her way to stay with someone else, not using the hotel room for 'business.'    And the beer bottles really makes me think she had a visitor or two that just didn't stay long, didn't want to stay long?  Yeah, it could have been a john, and that in itself could have triggered the - suicidality. Her suicide could have been a result of the trauma of her 'first time' as a prostitute, but I don't think there is much to back that up.   I'm not sure I'm convinced she was 'tricking.' The 500 dollars was in 100 dollar bills.  This leads me to think someone lovingly or at least deliberately gave her that money. The only time you get 100 bills is if you go to the bank and withdraw it. That's what I picture someone did for this money.  The money was clean (based on the pictures I saw), and in 100's, not the kind of small bills or at least 20s that you would expect a dealer or john to have. And I'd be surprised if it was stolen and she had stolen exactly 500 dollars in crisp 100s -  no more, no less.    I strongly feel that someone gave her that money, I don't think it was wages from a job or money she had saved, because the amount is too round. I get the impression someone wanted to 'help her out', or, more sadly, just send her on her way.  I feel really strongly that she was in the foster system, or at the very least had lived with a family member she wasn't strongly bonded with, and didn't have a real support system. And, perhaps the person she had most recently been living with had died, and that's why she was not reported missing.    I've known a lot of people like that in my life, and it's not an uncommon situation for young people to find themselves in. Also, I myself have been in a situation where if I had died suddenly, no one would have reported me missing for several weeks. My employers have any 'contact' numbers for anyone, and my 'family' ties were almost non existent.  It's chilling to think, but for some people, it's easy to fall through the cracks if you suddenly die.   something about her suicide seems really sudden to me.  The photobooth picture must have been recent because she had it with her, and it wasn't ragged or dirtied.  I feel like she had a big shock, a heartbreak like you said, and she was alone in that hotel room and...... well, you know.    This was the time before cell phones, so she may not have been able to call or reach her friend in the picture.  If he really was the guy who checked her in, then he was close with her up until the end. (But I think it's likely that the clerk misidentified him, often people who aren't of an ethnic group can confuse two people from the same ethnic group - I'm a minority, so I can attest to this, and I've also misidentified people not in my ethnic group on occasion, too. :/ )  I also think she wasn't 'officially homeless'.  The picture of the suitcase shows just a few sets of clothing.  It doesn't appear that she packed 'all her worldly posessions' into that suitcase.  I genuinely think she was traveling, she was on her way to visit someone, a family member or father, as you suggested.  I think she was on her way to visit someone and they let her down and for whatever reason, she couldn't 'go back' to where she came from and the heartbreak was too much for her.  shit, just knowing, if this had been in the time of cellphones, she could have called her friend.  And yeah, I wondered why he didn't 'come looking for her' but I wouldn't be surprised if her friend was undocumented, and not had very solid ties to the area himself. And if he believed she was 'moving away' or going to stay with a family member, he wouldn't have noticed her being missing.  Even if her death was reported on the news, was it a big news story? Back in the early 90's things didn't 'go viral' like they do now. Perhaps her friend didn't even expect to hear from her for a while.  I've known quite a few people who you would think had normal lives and normal families like every one else, but they were living out of their car, or staying with an elderly relative because all their other family had died or moved a way and left them behind.    This one seems so utterly tragic, because she seemed so full of life and optimism in that picture.  And the fact that no one reported a young, attractive, bubbly young woman missing is really heartbreaking.    Bit of a ramble, I know, but my final thought is that she was actually from the area, or from the adjacent states, she was in high school in the late 80's, and her picture is in a yearbook somewhere."
gratefuldoe,38wj39,cinnyc,2,Thu Jun 11 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Hush money is what I bet from the $500. And as for the beer, there are four bottles open; two just being finished, and two just started. That is two people having a beer. They're talking it all over, she wants this person (possibly whom she thinks is her father) to accept her into his life. He has another life already, does not have room for her. He tries to buy her off with the $500. She's not happy with it, and he leaves her devastated...two freshly cracked beers in the table she thought she was gonna sit and drink with this person. She smokes, and in her desperate heartbreak and hopelessness makes the decision that she just can't take it anymore."

Also, I have to be honest, one of the things I'm most convinced of (and this is just my opinion) is that she is was younger than 25 in 1991.  It's a very strong feeling I get, and I think placing her age as older than that would mean searching in the wrong places.   If, hypothetically, there was a page for her, I personally would want to 'target' her as being 22-25 in 1991, in order to get to the right group of people.  But I know that other people think she was as old as 35....I wonder if this would cause controversy or confusion?  What are your thoughts on this?"
gratefuldoe,38wj39,cinnyc,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know the etiquette for creating a fb page for her.  I do, however, agree that she could have been younger than estimated. Just by her belongings, clothing, and images of her. I think she could have been in her early twenties."

gratefuldoe,38iecg,Naliju,3,Thu Jun 4 12:36:34 2015 UTC,"JCD is definitely Caucasian. Not only did his skull analysis indicate a high probability (ie. beyond a reasonable doubt) of Caucasian ancestry, but his clothes and accessories point to being part of ""redneck metalhead"" culture too."

gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,2,Thu Jun 4 13:19:40 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the DNA results have come back with ""of Asian descent"", though?"
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,3,Thu Jun 4 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"That's the issue indeed.  Apparently this can be tough when it comes to native descent. A lot of people are white/native mixed at different degrees. You can physically look white as white it can be and have enough indian blood to be considered as one. This is why I wouldn't completely exclude people classified as natives, especially from Canada.  Anyway these are last resorts, I am personally 1000% sure that JCD remains unreported for some reason as the Grateful Doe was."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,2,Thu Jun 4 14:51:36 2015 UTC,"Something else that has bothered me....did JCD have facial hair or no? The 1st sketch of him (where he looks like a kid) had a slight beard (also the river guy sketch), but the most recent one doesn't have any...  Funny enough, though, the sketch with a beard has him looking young and frail, whereas the newest one without has him looking broad and sort of tough and handsome...  I know the sketches should be taken lightly, but that's been bothering me"
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,2,Thu Jun 4 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"Excellent question, I raised this issue just two days ago with u/dragthewaters91.  Basically, the FBI beardless one is the most accurate drawing. The thug like guy with the black beard ISN'T JCD (i.e from the recovered skeleton). It's the River Guy sketch according to eyewitness(es ?).   The third ""frail"" one is the first JCD sketch made before the FBI one. It is apparently inaccurate and authorities discouraged the group admins to use them on their document. This is a real issue since it also seems to indicate JCD was light blond, what he wasn't.   It seems to me that JCD was definitely beardless while RG was reported as bearded. I think u/dragthewaters91 will investigate this further though.  EDIT : Gr4mm4r"
gratefuldoe,38iecg,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jun 4 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"K.. That nullifies my next comment then. :)   """
gratefuldoe,38iecg,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jun 4 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"well, I'm not sure if facial hair conserves well from decomposition. By what I know hair does remains on the skull because the scalp dries off whereas the rest of the facial skin tends to rot away more easily. But I'm no forensic, I only speak from what I saw on the internet and such.   Then it seems to me that metalheads, especially at this age, don't usually sport beard and are usually cleanly shaved. I wouldn't expect JCD to sport facial hair."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,TVConefive,2,Thu Jun 4 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"My reply was going to be a stereotyping....  I haven't noticed many Asians or natives with facial hair..especially pre-20s.  If JCD did have a beard, that would lead me to believe he's likely white or mostly white.  Forgive the stereotyping there."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,3,Thu Jun 4 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"Well, genetically speaking, it's absolutely true. Caucasians produce far more facial hair and asians/natives/pacific islanders/inuits tend to have few of it. It can vary from individual to individual though (Edit : some asian ethnias do sport epic beards though, such as the Ainu). I think it's worth considering."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,2,Thu Jun 4 16:30:44 2015 UTC,"He's almost definitely white, according to authorities."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,IVIushroom,2,Thu Jun 4 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"That's why I think it's pulling the straw :/ I don't think that DNA testing can fail, do they ? Like if you're half or third asian, the test does detect that. But I suppose it could miss the famous ""1/5 cherokee"" stuff, that's why I'm theorizing on some native background. Isn't there a festival in Clinton devoted to native culture, the Miracle the white buffalo thing ? Somebody (sorry if I don't remember who, I think it was u/Iviushroom ?) brang that as a possibility for JCD's venue outside of his obvious metal tastes.   EDIt : crazy thought : is there any Indian reservation nearby ? Apparently missing persons are more common there than in the outside..."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,TVConefive,2,Thu Jun 4 22:58:22 2015 UTC,"JCD wasn't definitely beardless. The beard could have been lost (lol, that's kind of a ridiculous way of putting it but you know what I mean) during the decomposition process."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jun 4 22:36:56 2015 UTC,You're right. So we're kind of guessing here. I'm mostly betting on his age and his metalhead tastes.
gratefuldoe,38iecg,yoursmartfriend,2,Thu Jun 4 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about forensics to say if he could be immediately ruled out because he is Asian. I could not find much information on him, he may be mixed race. But JDC's build was on the smaller side and this could be why. Plus the straight hair is a match.   I don't know if they did a genetic test. Until someone knowledgeable says different I think he should be considered."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,dragthewaters91,2,Thu Jun 4 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I don't see a shy, straightforward local nerdy young adult in the verge of adopting a profession suddenly breaking bad, cutting ties with everybody without his belongings and turning into a raging hardcore metalhead fan while hitchhiking across the redneck midwest for the sake of it. Well granted, I've watched ""into the wild"" and ""the last king of scotland"" but...  I wonder if such cases were reported though."
gratefuldoe,38iecg,Doctor_StrangeLuv,3,Thu Jun 4 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"I see a kid from a broken home possibly finding an outlet in this type of scene.  A kid that lived in an awful situation and didn't come home most nights. A kid whose single parent was too busy with their own BS to have time to look after their child and may have found it a relief that he 'found his own way' and finally took off and stopped bothering the parent.  If he ever is ID'd, I would guess one would find freshman and sophomore pictures of him in the yearbook, but he would be absent from it his junior and senior year.  I'm from Beloit and have seen this personally be the case among some people I knew, and JCD ended up 15 minutes from where I sit right now. I'd bet he grew up in Beloit, Janesville, or Milton.  I obviously have a really sad image in my head of JCD, but it's what I feel is close to accurate"
gratefuldoe,38iecg,yoursmartfriend,2,Thu Jun 4 16:34:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info ! I think you're right on this. What really bothers me is, if he came from these three cities, why no friend, girlfriend, parent, relative, anything spoke out in 20 years about somebody like him missing in the vicinity.   I wonder why he was never reported though. The ""best"" option would be that his parents didn't knew where to report him due to his nomadic habits, exactly like Jason Callahan. In the worst cases, his parents kicked him out because of his tastes they assimilated to ""satanic"" habits or something. It seems to me this was quite a concern in the 90's ?   A middle ground would be that he was at odds with his olds, moved on and they never reported him because they assumed he just went to make his own life somewhere else.   I'm perhaps completely wrong but I'm not under the impression that he was a drifter, a runaway or that he was in all cases poor. I feel he was at least a middle class kid that had food on his table each morning. I could be wrong of course, you have a far better assessment of the local society than me !"
gratefuldoe,38iecg,Doctor_StrangeLuv,2,Thu Jun 4 16:45:45 2015 UTC,"I think your middle ground is pretty spot on....   I say he's probably from a broken home because of the fact he may not have been reported missing and the caregiver felt he took off with friends and that was it.. Likely never saw the story in 95 and the case went cold.   Friends of his, however few or plenty, perhaps also never heard of the body found and if they did perhaps saw the sketch and ""knew"" that wasn't the same guy, so didn't bother reporting it...

Maybe she just couldn't ""do it"" again. I'm thinking the baby section as a final resting place had more to do with seclusion. I don't know how much a cremation in Virginia was in the 90's but $50.00. She either didn't have the means to pay more or she knew the cost in advance. I do know that when I worked in a funeral home in Virginia it was $50.00 to have the ME come to sign off on a cremation. I also would imagine if she had a husband in the mausoleum she probably payed in advance to be placed with him. Again, thanks for the pictures, it helps with perspective."
gratefuldoe,38ewgk,happenstanced,3,Thu Jun 4 00:09:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the seclusion. This Babyland is tucked away behind the mausoleum, which is a perfect place for someone who didn't want to be interrupted or found right away.   As for the cancer? The scar is almost identical to some cancer surgery scars I have seen, so I think it's a very plausible theory.   Regarding the $50. Either she was without means to pay (she couldn't make a prearrangements) or she thought it was enough. For the ME to sign? Absolutely. But to cover cremation? No way.   It's possible with her age that, at one point, $50 was enough to cover it..."

I truly enjoy visiting cemeteries... looking at the art, enjoying the history... but I do agree w/ you that it did seem a little gloomy, and oddly enough, bleak.  While quiet and peaceful, it also seems rather stark.  Like I said, love cemeteries, but I wouldn't have enjoyed being there either!  BTW, I am starting to get the feeling that our Doe didn't know anyone in Babyland.  I think she chose the spot because it was quiet, out of the way, and sort of protected.  No one would stop her if they found her before she was gone because no one would notice her.  I don't know... I'm rambling."

I have always found it so heartbreaking when somebody needs to be identified by their jewelry.  Where I live, murders do not happen often, and when they do, they are usually perpetrated by family members, so it is very rare that somebody dies and is unidentified.   However, there was a murder a few years ago where the woman could only be identified by her jewelry. I kept thinking how heartbreaking it would be for one of her loved ones recognised her jewelry from the Facebook posts that were floating around. Which, of course, is how she was identified.  It's just so tragic."

gratefuldoe,3876xk,Naliju,2,Tue Jun 2 09:58:49 2015 UTC,"Ok u/zombiegrey and u/dragthewaters91, so new material here. Lurking on google map showed some interesting results :  *Ignoring all the slopes and cliffs, the ""general"" distance between JCD and the water is like 50m  *Google earth also shows another place allegedly called Carver-Roehl park on the south east, but I think it could be a mistake from the software, since the place looks like a simple crossroad  *I've for now found no place I could identify for sure as a trailer park, however there are many open fields with barns or similar structures I assume are full of rusted abandoned cars they use for the scrap material (?) or something of the sort. (I wonder if I'm not mistaking abandonned trucks for trailers ?)  *The most interesting thing I've found and which could be a really significant information, is that unlike today, in 1992 there was, 200m south from JCD, a small (40m long, 70m wide) open field (?) followed by a 700m long thin trail in the field with the southernmost farmhouse (the one of the patch owner ?). The 92 satellite view also well show a clear separation between JCD's forest patch and the surrounding riparian woods. Both the trail and the clearing were abandoned and replaced by vegetation prior to 2005. Instead another trail separating the two southern fields is used. But I suppose it's mainly used by motorized vehicles. Here's a picture of the whole thing in 92 : http://imgur.com/LDtR5pB  This I think could be crucial because it means that JCD or other people could have easily joined the forest patch using this trail in no time. I would be indeed surprised if this wasn't the case. I think it is important to know if this trail still existed by the time JCD died but also where « Shady hill » or another place where young gathered are.  EDIT : spelling"
gratefuldoe,3876xk,dragthewaters91,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"This is all great info :)  Carver-Roehl Park is north of Turtle Creek.  Where did you find the info about the field and trail?  As I mentioned, there is a trailer park right now (Parkview Heights I think it's called?) about 2 miles SW of where JCD was found. I am not sure if it's the same trailer park with a different name.  So let's compile a list of questions for me to ask Jack: 1) Where was the Shady Hill trailer park? 2) Was the hair test used to test for anything else besides coke and opiates? Such as amphetamines, benzos or PCP? 3) What are your thoughts on JCD being dumped at that location after an OD/alcohol poisoning, or after being beaten in a brawl? Would it be feasible given the terrain?"
gratefuldoe,3876xk,dragthewaters91,2,Wed Jun 3 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry I missed that info !  Google earth as always. I linked a picture on Imgur I made where you can see the trail joining the ""longfarm"" and the forest patch where I marked JCD.   That's it ! But since there is no mark on the skeleton or skull, I think it's less feasible that he was beaten but rather that he became unconscious or came into a coma after an accident, such as colliding with a tree while falling.   I think knowing if the trail was here at the time, if the longfarm was used by the local young and the nature of the slope by the creek are important (could an intoxicated RG have clung the slope to the forest patch where he died ?)."
gratefuldoe,3876xk,IVIushroom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"There's a ""Parkview Heights"" marked near but it is in the middle of a field, itself near what I think is a farm and there's no trailer visible. It's quite far from JCD's, farer than the CR park, about 5km.   EDIT : I'm working on another hypothesis which would be that JCD was a nomad/drifter who went from city to city to follow metal concerts and similar (as we mostly all think), was in a stopover in Janesville or Clinton and went in this specific place because he was addicted to a very specific drug you can't find anywhere, and he was running out of it. He is then told by locals this particular place could sell him what he sought, and then he got into some trouble with the dealers. I just don't see, 1) why he was there if he wasn't a local young, 2) if he was here following friends or a girlfriend, why he wasn't reported by these possible relatives.   If I was a metalhead rolling from city to city I wouldn't go in the ""redneck"" back country for the lulz, far from any city, hotel, nightclub and such ; if it wasn't for a ""good reason"" such as running out of a rare drug I was addicted to."
gratefuldoe,3876xk,IVIushroom,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm...I didn't check to see if there was actually a trailer park there, I just blindly trusted the map. Clearly I am not a detail person.  It's far but not that far. It would be like, a 40 minute walk. In any case we have to confirm where that trailer park was. All that area around the creek looks like farmland that's part of peoples' property, so I'm not sure where there would be room for a trailer park."

For example he could have had an aneurysm that burst after being was hit in the head. Or a heart defect that killed him while fighting. In any case I am not sure we will ever find the cause of death, so that's probably a dead end in terms of speculation.  What do you mean by clung to the slope? You mean crawled up the slope from the creek, then died there? That seems to be the prevalent theory so I am pretty sure it's plausible. As for likely, well that's anyone's guess.

For instance, in JCD's area there's only images from 92, and then several ones after the mid 2000.   Exactly. The eyewitness said he tried to climb it and failed. I wonder then if it's that feasible. We can't know for sure, but I think the possibility that he came from the south must be taken in account, especially if it was easy to access this spot back then from there.

The worst of it is that ""Shady hill"" isn't a nickname as I thought, but apparently the real name of the thing.  You can check it out on google earth. I've checked it before and strongly thought this was the place, since it's apparently a pauper neighborhood, but these are mostly shacks rather than trailers. It's on the north west of JCD's forest patch. If JCD is river guy, then it makes total sense if he came from there and my hypothesis doesn't work well.   Edit : http://imgur.com/Z1myrh1 Distance between JCD and the creek bank.

He wasn't really strolling through the woods, like on some kind of spirit quest or whatever...the area he was found in isn't THAT remote. It is rural, but there were houses relatively close by. The place where he died was someone's property. In addition, at the head of the creek is a park that was known as the ""party spot"" back then.

It's not easy to make someone hang themselves, and it would likely cause some marks of struggle on the body.   The only way I see this could be a homicide is that she was poisoned, but she only tested positive for morphine. Unless someone gave her the drug without her knowing and she then hung herself, I don't believe this is a homicide. Of course I won't rule out the possibility entirely."

It's a slim chance that there's a record of who checked it out but if one was kept, it might not be a bad idea to check into who checked it out in the 90s.  I remember school libraries using digital check out methods in Fairfax schools in the 90s instead of check out cards but am not sure if the public libraries did the same thing."
gratefuldoe,3844bq,zombiegrey,4,Tue Jun 2 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"It looks like Fairfax currently has 5 copies in circulation, but likely none that have been in the system for 20 years. Libraries routinely discard old, poor condition, or low circulation material to make room for newer volumes.   Most modern library systems also don't keep a record of everyone who has checked an item out due to confidentiality issues as well as data storage limits. Usually we can tell who was the most recent borrower, but not much further back than that. Even if I were able to find a copy that fit the bill I wouldn't be able to ask for prior borrower information without a police warrant. Librarians are sticklers for patron confidentiality.  That being said, it's an excellent suggestion! I'll see if I can get my hands on a couple of the existing copies to see if they still have the old check out cards in the back. Patrons will also sometimes write notes in library books so it's worth a look!"

I had a thought looking over her information, though, that I don't think anyone else has brought up.   She had clothes from Nordstrom's, a backpack from REI and a jacket from Eddie Bauer. What do all three of these chains have in common? They're all based in Seattle.  Secondly--and, to be fair, this one's quite tenuous--one of her tapes was a Monty Python tape. The PBS station in Seattle used to show a lot of British comedy (at least in the '80s and '90s when I was growing up in a Canadian town that got their signal--I attribute a lot of my own love for British comedy to Seattle PBS!).   It might all be coincidence, but it might be worth taking a look at the PNW? (That said, if that's the case, I have no idea how/why she ended up in VA.)"
gratefuldoe,382kz7,Pris257,3,Tue Jun 2 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"The backpack was offered by REI in 1986 and most likely not past 1990.  REI only had 46 stores in the US back then, the majority of them on the west coast."

She was wearing a hooded jacket, a sweater and two pullover shirts. 17th and 18th of December were both around 40-50F (7-12C). Here are the weather records from the day. Do you think this was a lot of clothing for such a mild weather, or is this common for the locals? Could she have been from somewhere warmer?  That link was for December 17th, 1996 (I estimated this is when she went to buy clothes, brandy and look for the final resting place). Here are the records for the 18th.  It just seems like she was wearing a lot of stuff, as if she didn't know how to dress up for a weather like that (she was from down south or somewhere warmer in general), or as if she didn't know how to dress up in general (like some mental illnesses/alcoholism etc. sometimes makes people dress up weirdly).

gratefuldoe,382kz7,Naliju,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:48:04 2015 UTC,"I just found this case a few minutes ago so these are just my 1st thoughts. Doe network has her estimated age 50-70 so she may not have had any living family left- could have been an only child and parents passed on. However since she had a "" no code-dnr-no penicillin"" chain she must have been allergic to penicillin hence been to a dr at some point and with the no code-dnr makes me think possibly had a terminal disease in the early stages maybe which goes back to having seen a dr.  I also think that the place is odd especially if its a place a person wouldn't necessarily know about unless you are from or spent time in the area. I think possibly one of the children buried is hers-possibly and my bet is not a recent death. Im thinking she was terminally ill and wanted to be with her child. Perhaps the child suffocated in an accident but I don't really think the way she did it is was symbolic so I would be checking the parents of any of the children buried there but I don't know how large the cemetery is. We know she had ""upscale"" items possibly from somewhere like saks so she was probably financially comfortable but with nobody missing her or coming forward makes me think possibly the money was from a deceased husband/relative. The tapes could help because in 96 how popular was Foxworthy? I don't know but I don't remember hearing any of his stuff at the time ( of course I was a busy single parent also) Monty python I had heard of at the time but what area was Foxworthy popular in at the time? south, southwest, north, northeast? I am in the Midwest myself and with the internet still fairly new at the time she had to be in an area where these things were popular to have heard them and to buy the tapes. anyway just my 1st thoughts on it"
gratefuldoe,382kz7,Pris257,0,Wed Jul 1 14:07:56 2015 UTC,"I am probably going way out on another tangent here..but how common is it for people to leave the Amish community? Also, which states are the Amish mostly concentrated in?  Is it possible (not necessarily AJD) that some of these unidentified people could have left the Amish community (Or even the Polygamy Mormon sect) years ago, and that is why noone is looking for them.  Maybe, they have been shunned by their loved ones. That also could be a reason that there is no missing persons report for these people.  If AJD did leave a community like the Amish or the Polygamy Mormons , then she probably had noone to bury her or miss her etc. Maybe she then found out that she was ill and so she decided to have her own little funeral and surround herself with the things that made her happy. She could have had a childlike presence about her, because she was sheltered for so long or she worked with Children and that job made her happy too. That could be a reason she laid down near the Babyland section.

Alcohol ""helps"" because it keeps the liver busy, allowing the pills to be processed last, thus maximizing their efficiency.   An example of the pill potency:  Alone, the pills equate to 2+2=4.  With alcohol, it works out to be somewhere around 2+2=6.   The body metabolizes the liquor first, then the drugs, allowing them to remain in the body longer.   The toxicity level of medication varies by person and by tolerance (and by how much alcohol is imbibed).

For example, does he recommend that the yogurt is cold or that the alcohol should be of a certain kind? I was thinking if he recommended washing the pills down with cold mixers, it would mean she definitely bought the juice near the cemetery or else the jucie wouldn't be cold when she drank it."
gratefuldoe,37wm0s,Pris257,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:21:49 2015 UTC,"No, just what I wrote. Here's some more info on that part:  An hour before have an extremely light meal.  At the same time take a travel sickness pill.  When an hour has elapsed, take about 10 of your chosen tablets with a large drink of spirits or wine.   Have additional powdered tablets already mixed into a pudding and swallow that as fast as possible.  Throughout, keep plenty of alcoholic drink or soda at your side to wash this down.  In both cases in which I assisted death, the person fell asleep within a couple of minutes and remained inactive."

A lot has been said about the stores her clothes were from but maybe she wanted to go out with ""dignity."" Maybe she picked the clothes up at a thrift or consignment store.

I found this from LE   Regarding the $50 bills she left for us; we didn't use them to cremate her body, but kept them in our property room. The bills are crisp and the serial numbers are sequential, so she probably went to a bank just prior to her death.

gratefuldoe,379vwm,zombiegrey,3,Tue May 26 03:25:07 2015 UTC,"I have no idea.  Standard medical alert bracelets were typically silver with a fairly heavy chain.  The engraved part usually had a red caduceus on the left and a description of potential issues on the right (""Penicillin allergy"", ""Peanut allergy,"" ""Bee Allergy"", ""Diabetic"", etc)  You could get them from your doctor, a pharmacy, and medical supply places.  You could also write away for them with ads in the backs of some magazines.  If you are allergic to certain drugs or substances, those things can save your life."

gratefuldoe,379vwm,zombiegrey,1 point,Tue May 26 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"Check my comment below, it seems like the vendor, country etc. all have an impact on what kind of bracelet you can get. We should take a look into the DNR policy in the 90s and how did one get a bracelet back then."

In Canada it seems like you can buy them from that website, and you can choose your style.   In both countries, provincial/state laws are to be honoured when it comes to DNR/no CODE orders.  They cremated the bracelet with her, which is a shame. I'm thinking it would have been possible, maybe still is, to identify her by the bracelet."

NOVA is a suburban sprawl, so most people travel by car, or maybe take the metro in DC. I lived in VA for the first 21 years of my life, and only rode the Amtrak once, for a special trip to New York. What I mean to say is that if she took the Amtrak, she likely wasn't from anywhere near VA or DC, because if she were, she would've just driven or driven/walked to the cemetery.

They brought bloodhounds in that day. The dogs followed her scent into the middle of the road and stopped. Rumors, tips and hints flooded in, sightings of a small girl with a man heading south.

gratefuldoe,375bgh,Pris257,3,Mon May 25 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"After my mom got divorced and sold the house, she moved into an apartment.  Coincidentally enough, she knew the guy that lived below her.  Not good friends but they knew a lot of the same people. She hadn't seen him in awhile and one day, the sheriff came and emptied the apartment.  She called the office and asked what happened.  They just said he stopped paying rent and got evicted.  My mom was a little worried so she started asking mutual friends.   She found out that he moved.  Didn't want any of the stuff he had.  Took a few clothes and just said fuck it.     It just struck me as odd in the sense that if he didn't have any family and just disappeared, my mom could have been the only one asking.  The apartment complex didn't care.  The sheriff's office just dumped his stuff and left.   I can see how it would be easy to get lost if you didn't have any family looking.  Or even if you did have a few friends/family that you talked to every so often.      I like the idea of her ending it on her terms.  But why the mystery?    Maybe an insurance policy that wouldn't have paid out for suicide.  So nobody is looking  One of the things I hate about some of the other forums is the amount of speculation and 'if that was me...' type of shit.  And the over-analysis.   Some things get repeated so often that it almost becomes fact.  You don't know what they were thinking.  You'll never know.   Your feeling might be just that, a feeling.  That's why I like it here.

Distinguishing Characteristics: White female. Black hair; hazel eyes. Marks, Scars: Discoloration on her left ankle. Clothing: Black windbreaker jacket, white shoes. Dentals: Not Available.   Circumstances of Disappearance Bernier was last seen in San Diego, California on August 19, 1996.     Possible match? 1. There is a pretty close resemblence between Susan and Jane Doe - especially if you think of Susan with a little more weight on her. 2. Susan was only 90lbs in August of 1996 - Jane Doe was 156 pounds in December 1996 This, and the hair color, are the biggest descrepancies   This is my theory. Jane Doe did not want to be identified. Disappear 6 months before, put on weight, change your hair color, go to an unknown location on the other side of the country, dress differently (no info if this is true).  Its possible that someone with either saved money, or selling of jewellery might have been able to travel in comfort for 6 months......

They had/have several locations in the area, the nearest to her chosen death site being at Tysons Corner in Falls Church.   This caught my attention, as I was looking into metro stations around the area. There's one in West Falls Church, around 3.8 miles walking distance. I'm thinking the woman used the Washington Metro Area Transit metro to get there, and went shopping at the Nordstrom.   There are several upscale places in Tysons Corner, such as Macy's and Bloomingdale's - I have not confirmed if these operated in 1996.   There seems to be a CVS pharmacy in the same shopping centre - cannot confirm yet if it operated in 1996.   What's more, there's an Eddie Bauer store in Tysons Corner. I emailed them to ask whether this location was open in 1996. EDIT// I got an answer that they have no records on which Eddie Bauer stores were open and where in 1996. Weird in my opinion."

gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,4,Wed Jun 3 00:17:26 2015 UTC,"Alright. Mind is rambling so I'm gonna put some thoughts down.  She was around 50-70 years old, which means that she was probably not a fresh mom, if she was mourning a child. Her child would have probably be born around 60s-80s. If she was around 60-70 y/o, her child could have been born around 50s-70s.   Clothing. I think this woman had no one left. She did not buy this kind of clothing normally, but since she had no heirs to inherit her, she decided to spend her last money on nice clothing that she always dreamed of. Or she just wanted to look nice for her Xmas party. I know it's a long shot, but the Nordstrom stores that sell the brand she was wearing might have customer records. She bought a lot of stuff at once - we're talking hundreds of dollars. There could be a lead there. Long shot but might be worth it.  Brandy is not cheap, it should be around $50 a bottle. Could find out what kind of brandy she was having, did she have the bottle with her? Is the bottle still stored as evidence? If it's a rare kind of brandy, it could be possible to track the liquor down.   Looza juice. Was this popular in the US? Was it sold in basically every corner store? Seems like Tropicana bought the brand in 1995. Looza is a Belgian manufacturer. If the juice was not sold widely in the US, it could be a lead.  The pink Minnie Mouse fanny pack leads me to thinking she had a baby girl once. She lost this daughter somehow. I know we are considering death, but how about adoption? What if she gave her child away and regretted it? What if the kid was abducted? What if she killed her baby on her own and never told anyone? This could explain why she was not near any particular grave. She either knew the body was somewhere else, or did not have a body at all.  Another thought on the graveyard is that she was not actually mourning a child but a husband. Maybe his husband died in war? Or went missing? I have no evidence to base this thought on, so it's just a thought.  Nationality. I don't know why but I have a feeling she might have been from Europe. When I first saw her photo I was thinking Russian/Eastern European, possibly illegal, but considering the money I don't think she would have been able to support herself with odd jobs. Did people in the US ask for work permits in the 90s?   Based on the Looza juice, I was considering maybe she's Belgian? But the tapes she was listening to - were they common in the US? I've always considered Monty Python a more European thing but I might be wrong. And Jeff Foxworthy is very US.   The DNR bracelet is something you have to register for, if I'm not completely mistaken. Does anyone know more about this? We could go to r/AskDoctors and find out if they know better.  Lastly, and sorry for the long post, the ring. Gold with jade stones. Did it have anything inside it, indicating where it could be from? Who made it? Any initials?"
gratefuldoe,371ksz,TVConefive,4,Tue May 26 02:44:49 2015 UTC,Has anyone considered contacting Looza USA asking for a better photo of the juice bottle that was sold in the 1990's and asking how wide spread/where it was sold back then?
gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,2,Wed May 27 03:22:06 2015 UTC,I can do that after I'll get an answer from Looza Belgium.
gratefuldoe,371ksz,TVConefive,3,Wed May 27 13:46:03 2015 UTC,"Did people in the US ask for work permits in the 90s?   I think there was a lot of ""under the table"" type of work going on then when it involved foreign workers. She could have been a maid or Nannie. It is a wealthy area close to D.C. Maybe she was fired or the child she was a Nannie to died.     I've always considered Monty Python a more European thing   Oh no! What's more American than a naked guy playing an organ!   The DNR bracelet is something you have to register for, if I'm not completely mistaken.   My understanding is anyone can purchase one. The question is did she have this due to a terminal illness or because she was planning to kill herself and it was in case she was found before she was clinically dead?"
gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,3,Tue May 26 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification again. Could the DNR bracelets be bought anywhere? Do you have to go to a certain shop, a pharmacy etc. for it?   For the terminal illness I guess we would need the autopsy information. But was that ever carried out, since she asked not to have one? What I do know is that she was cremated, according to this thread.  'Asked NCMA... here sis their response: We don’t have any photos on file of her clothing or a post mortem photo. I can try to check with law enforcement and see if they have anything. I do know she was cremated and back when we registered her the detective still had her ashes in his office because he didn’t think it was right to put her in the property room. It might take me a little bit as we are re-locating once again and I have limited access right now from home on stuff. I’ll let you know what I find out though.'"

gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,4,Tue May 26 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I'm just thinking she could be from Belgium/Luxembourg/The Netherlands because of the juice (detectives said they'd never seen the Looza juice anywhere, others say it's fairly common now but not sure on 1996) and the random possible connection to Liège. Apparently these glasses were trifocal, which basically means they are prescription glasses or she found them in a thrift store.  Ah also I'm thinking she probably had no connections to the area, date or anything. She probably read a book called 'Final Exit - the Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying' by Derek Humphry. The book describes how to easily and gracefully commit suicide, it's basically identical with her way of leaving this world. I can do a longer post about the book if you'd like."

gratefuldoe,371ksz,TVConefive,3,Tue May 26 23:58:13 2015 UTC,Awesome! Would you happen to know if eyeglasses come with serial numbers? Any trends with prescriptions nowadays versus in the 90s?
gratefuldoe,371ksz,TooOldForThat,5,Wed May 27 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, glasses themselves don't come with serial numbers on them. The only things on them are the codes for the glasses brand and the measurements for the nose piece. The prescription itself on this Jane Doe looks very weak, like she would primarily wear them for driving at night and reading only, not throughout the day. (I'm basing this off of the appearance that there is not much, if any, prescription in the top part of the lens which is used for distance. Completely theorizing this, of course, off of one photograph.) The bottom has a pretty significant prescription, my guess is +2.50, +2.75, or +3.00. This would put her at above 55 years old.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help much. Executive bifocals were only popular in the 1980s/1990s, and any leads relating to ""CSL"" have turned up empty after asking a few opticians within the last 5-10 minutes. However, in theory, she could've even bought these over-the-counter, like regular reading glasses; not common, but possible, especially if there is no ('plano') prescription in the top part of the lens.

gratefuldoe,371ksz,TVConefive,1 point,Tue May 26 23:31:14 2015 UTC,"Trifocal lenses:       Trifocals, patented in 1827 by John Isaac Hawkins, are eyeglasses with lenses that have three regions which correct for distance, intermediate (arm's length), and near vision.  Trifocals are mostly used by people with advanced presbyopia who have been prescribed 2 diopters or more of reading addition. The intermediate addition is normally half the reading addition. So, for someone with a distance prescription of −4 diopters and a reading addition of +3, the reading portion of their trifocals would have a net power of −1, and the intermediate segment would be −2.5 diopters.  Trifocal lenses are made in similar styles to bifocals, but with an additional segment for intermediate vision above the reading section. A common style is the 7×28 flat-top or D-shaped segment, 28 mm wide, with a 7 mm high intermediate segment. Larger intermediate segments are available, and are particularly useful for people who spend a lot of time using computers.

gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,3,Tue May 26 03:48:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, thinking stuff again. The Looza bottle appears to be North American, because it has the capacity in fluid oz instead of milliliters, which is used in Europe. If we had a better picture of the bottle, we could find out whether the label is in English or in another language. If it's in English, it's probably bought randomly in a corner store to go with the brandy. Brandy was probably mixed into the Looza bottle with the juice.  I tried enhancing the Looza photo, and I can make it a bit clearer but the text is still not visible enough, at least to my eye. Do we have any better photos of the bottle? Negatives left from the scene? Negs would rock my world.  Even more thoughts: where was the bottle made? Are they all bottled in Belgium? Would it be possible to trace the bottle to the manufacturer, and check where they shipped stuff from that exact manufacturer?  Before falling asleep last night I was thinking why didn't she want autopsy? Did she know she could be identified if autopsy was done, or did she want to spare the trouble from others? Is this in the book, Final Exit? She was cremated, and nothing was brought up about that, so I guess they didn't come across any artificial limbs, screws or plates that would have serial numbers in them. I'm leaning more and more towards terminal illness, hence the DNR, no CODE and no autopsy stuff.   Another thought - why both DNR and no CODE? It's basically the same thing, the other one is just an older expression, right? Does someone know more about this?"

In the US, according to this site, a DNR is a legal order written either in the hospital or on a legal form to respect the wishes of a patient to not undergo CPR or advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) if their heart were to stop or they were to stop breathing.  IF the DNR bracelet was valid, she must have had to sign up for it somewhere. According to this site there are only two vendors from which you can buy DNR/no CODE bracelets that are valid in Virginia. One of the vendors is in VA, the other one is in FL. If the bracelet was valid and she was, indeed, from VA, she must have bought it in either one of these vendors, assuming that these same vendors operated in 1996. I'm thinking of contacting the VA department of public health or something like that, or one of the vendors, to ask whether they would know what the policy in the 90s was.   Any ideas are welcome."

gratefuldoe,371ksz,-Urbex-,3,Wed May 27 21:40:42 2015 UTC,Have added to 'General Research' so that we are able to keep up to date with information :)
gratefuldoe,371ksz,cryptenigma,4,Wed May 27 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"(Sorry in advance for the post length, but I had several concerns over this particular case which takes time to explain properly)  What really intrigued me about this case since the beginning is not only that the Jane Doe did intended to become a Jane Doe ; but that she actually knew the concept of does for unidentified decedents and that she was familiar and confident enough with the concept as to take several precautions to avoid any form of identification after death - precautions which proved themselves successful even until today.  Perhaps I'm a completely wrong, but it seems to me that the whole unidentified decedent issue is mostly unknown by the general public and that people familiar with the whole ""Jane/John Doe"" thing are scarce, especially in the pre-internet era.  Until recently I had no idea that unidentified bodies were so common. I had never heard of it before from other people. The idea never crossed my mind that modern remains, especially from recently deceased people, could still (no pun intended) remain unidentified for son long and that it was a real issue nowadays. Perhaps it is a better acknowledged problem in the US than in Europe, and perhaps this is why I never knew about all that before a few months ago. But it still seems to me that it tends to be a largely ignored concern.   So I can't but think that our doe was familiar with the whole unidentified decedent thing as we are. Perhaps she did her whole research on the matter, had a relative she thought could be a doe ? Perhaps it was part of her job ? Could she had been a cop or a sleuth, or having been married to one who did researches on does ? Could she had worked in the whole funeral activity and had been involved with a doe as part of her job ? (it seems to me she could have been familliar with the whole funeral thing as well)  Other crazy idea : are other does buried in the cemetery or a proximal one, especially baby/infant does ? I recall that several cases of baby and infant does exist, especially several cases of latino and afro americans infant does which were killed and dumped by their parents or caretakers. Several cases of deceased newborns does are known as well.  The idea I have is that she was from another state, in all cases far from the place where she was discovered so she couldn't be identified by a local, or somebody who was alone. Lone living elderly people are a real concern in France, but I don't know if this is as common in the USA. She gets me the impression that she was an old lone woman which gradually lost her family and relatives or all ties with them for several reasons and, finally, decided to perform this symbolical suicide. But it doesn't looks something a ""weak minded"" old person living all alone would do ; more the work of an intelligent person who gradually lost ties and held a certain form of cynicism over life. A concern I have is if she lived alone on her own or in a retiring home. In all cases it seems to me she well planned how to remain unidentified and picked another state where she wouldn't be reported as missing, or remained in her state but knew she wouldn't be reported as missing because she had no friend or relative/friend or relatives who wished so.   Another concern I have is : how many time did she lingered in the cemetery ? Did she immediately came, picked a place and committed suicide or could she had stayed on place for several hours before deciding to do so ? I know the brandy (as the Looza juice) was probably used only as a way to take the valium, but the first thing that popped in my mind when I've read the description was that she made her little ""final party"" with the little christmas tree, the wine, the juice, the tape and the fine clothes before committing suicide quickly. I know they were no direct witnessed but I wonder if there are or were means to estimate that indirectly, such as footprints. I think these apparently petty details could be important to determine her intents or her whole psychology.   Finally, if she didn't wanted autopsy, it seems to me that it has to do with her wish to remain unidentified. Perhaps she had some kind of rare terminal illness (for example a rare kind of cancer) which would have made it easier to identify her ? Could we search for all the matching people which have disappeared before her death which were known to bear some kind of particularly rare illness or condition ? Another possibility is that she had an odd kind of operation in the past (--> the C scar ?), or some internal oddity (for instance the lack of an organ she donned, an organ placed on the opposite side…) which would had made her easier to identify."
gratefuldoe,371ksz,Donotclosetheblinds,5,Sun May 31 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"Good thinking! I've been contemplating the same thing: she seemed like she wanted to go a happy&painless way rather than suffering for a long time. But why remain a Doe if she had no one left? Didn't want old friends to know she had committed a suicide?  Also good points about the possible connection to Does in her work / earlier life, I didn't even think about that. To me it was clear as a day that everyone would know about Does! But as you said, especially in a pre-internet era it was probably not so common information. I don't remember where but someone speculated maybe she worked on a graveyard, maybe she worked in a funeral home, or as a pathologist, a cop, detective, psychologist...   I also agree on this person not being weak-minded. Committing suicide, especially planning it this well, takes a lot of balls. This woman was meticulous and carefully hid her identity. I think she was a very strong person but didn't want to suffer anymore."

I saw where /u/-Urbex- contacted Nordstorms Customer Services and they required a name to search for purchases.   Edit: I re-read over the Google Doc and noticed that Doe knew how much cremation and the ME would cost. Since Dona Thompson worked in a healthcare setting with older people, I'm almost certain that she would be familiar with the procedures after someone dies.

gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,4,Thu Jun 25 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"definitely worth looking ! Though I feel the age is a bit of a stretch.   EDIT : what about the name/surname ? She was also known as : Dona Bezk and Dona Toombs. (a maiden name ? Plus a nickname ? Ex husband name perhaps ?) this could have helped her to cover her tracks if she disappeared willingly.)  I was unable to find what ""Bezk"" means - apparently it's not a word in any language, perhaps a litteral mistranslation of some central/eastern European word ? Mispronounced or mistyped ""Beth/beck"" ? But ""Toombs"" definitely sounds like ""Tombs"" !  Could be the fact she died in a cemetary a clue she had left about her identity ?  EDIT 2 : I am now fairly convinced it could be her. Height and weight correspond. The context seems to works ; left on a pretext, abandonned her car somewhere and took the train until where she was found ; AJD was found only three months after her disappearence. I will only be convinced otherwise if you show me a missing person case even more similar to her.  EDIT 3 : the path from Bay City MI to Annandale, VI is pretty straightforward. I wonder if we could draw an hypothetical journey using what we already know about what bus/tramway she took before coming to the cemetary. I made a Google Map screenshot : http://imgur.com/kgwdqky  The Amtrak map : http://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/948/674/System0211_101web,0.pdf  It appears that the nearest Amtrak station is Lorton, which is a terminal for the Auto train who runs from Florida. So perhaps she ""ended"" here by letting herself travel from a southern destination. This seems to go against the theory that Dona is our Doe, but remember if she is, then she was three months (EDIT : eight) outside before going there, so perhaps she travelled accross the country using trains and whatnot. Otherwise, it would be nice to look over missing persons in Florida."
gratefuldoe,371ksz,kid775,3,Thu Jun 25 14:16:59 2015 UTC,"All good points!  Also, the more I think about it, the more I think that 49 could be a plausible age for Jane Doe. She likely had some health issues (scar on abdomen) and she was a bit overweight, which could have made her appear to be older than she really was.  (Case in point, based on Dona's photograph, I might have assumed that she was over 49.)  Plus, it seems to me that Monty Python and Jeff Foxworthy would appeal to/resonate with the Baby Boomer demographic much more than the older Silent Generation demographic."

From dental work you can sometimes tell from which area of the world a person is from, i.e. Scandinavia has a certain method of dental work, whereas Germany uses other methods etc.   What I'm thinking is that if we took a closer look into the dental work, charts etc. we might be able to find out whether she's from the States of somewhere else. The photos/charts could be shown to a dental expert or something. At least I think we could find out whether she was from a middle class family, lower middle class or something else."

Here is the text:  VICTORIA Police has used DNA to solve a missing person case from almost 44 years ago.  Cold case detectives have been able to prove that Tamara Milograd had two children after disappearing as a teenager during a trip to the Royal Melbourne Show in 1971.  One of those children, Corinna Russell, was just eight months old when her mother, who told all the people in her new life her name was Pauline Russell, died in a car crash in 1976.  It wasn’t until earlier this month that Tamara’s mother Luba, 90, and brothers Eugene, Nick and Alex finally learned the truth of what happened to Tamara.  They have thought for almost 44 years that Tamara had run away from home as a 15-year-old and was alive and living under a false name somewhere.  The determination of Corinna Russell, 39, to discover the background of the mother she lost as a baby recently resulted in her and the Milograd family finding out Tamara Milograd and Pauline Russell are the same person.  Schoolgirl Tamara Milograd was one of the 7000 or so people who are reported missing in Victoria every year.  Sadly, she wasn’t one of the 85 per cent of missing people who either return home or are found within the first 24 hours.  It was 1971 and Tamara was just a few months short of her 16th birthday.  She had become a rebellious teenager and was mixing with the wrong crowd.  Her older brother Eugene, 18 at the time, noticed Tamara had become withdrawn and wanted to go out meeting boys rather than spend time with him and their parents and her two younger brothers, Nick, 12 and Alex, 9.  He said it became obvious Tamara was not keen on following the path her Eastern European family had set out for her.  Tamara walked out of the Milograd family home in Mason St, Newport, on September 18, 1971, telling her mother she was going to the Royal Melbourne Show with a girlfriend.  She never came back and her family never saw or heard from her again. Corinna Russell as a baby being held by the woman she knew as Pauline Russell.  Corinna Russell as a baby being held by the woman she knew as Pauline Russell.  After initially fearing foul play, the Milograds eventually came to accept Tamara had chosen to run away.  What seemed like reliable confirmed sightings of her in the following months helped convince them Tamara had voluntarily embarked on a new life.  But they never gave up hope of finding her or getting news on how she was, spending years searching each time a new lead came in.  Tamara’s late father Alexander’s dying words to his wife Luba in 1989 were a heartfelt plea to “please find Tamara, please”.  There was a burst of publicity in the Tamara case in 2010 when Australian Federal Police chose her as one of the three faces of National Missing Persons week.  The AFP invited Tamara’s brother Eugene to speak at the media launch of National Missing Persons Week in Melbourne that year.  He made an emotion plea for anybody who knew anything about Tamara to come forward — or for Tamara herself to make contact in some way to let the family know she was alive and well.  “No matter how far or long apart there is always a bond between family members that cannot ever be diminished,” Eugene Milograd said at the 2010 press conference.  “Of course we would dearly love to know what she has done with her life and if she had any children.”  What Eugene Milograd didn’t know at the time he made that statement on television and in print was that Tamara had indeed had children and that one of them, Corinna Russell, was within five years of solving the mystery of what became of Tamara Milograd.  Corinna had a tragic start to life.  She was only eight months old when her mother, Pauline Russell, died in a car crash at Lake Bolac in Victoria on June 24, 1976, as she was travelling from her home in Penshurst in south western Victoria to Melbourne.  Pauline Russell was a back seat passenger in a car which wasn’t fitted with rear seat belts. Tamara Milograd in a school photograph.  Tamara Milograd in a school photograph.  Her partner, Corinna’s father Leonard Wells, was a front seat passenger in the car being driven by his best mate, Euro Russo.  A coroner found Pauline Russell died through misadventure after Mr Russo failed to obey signs to give way as he made a right hand turn from Warrnambool-Ararat Rd onto the Glenelg Highway at 9.30pm.  Evidence was given at the inquest that Mr Wells yelled “we aren’t going to make it” as the car went through a give way sign and into the path of a semi-trailer.  Pauline Russell and Mr Russo both died in the accident. Mr Wells was injured, including having an ear ripped off, but survived.  The fatal crash left Corinna and her two-year-old brother Lee without a mother.  “Because my father was a young single parent, I believe welfare was pursuing him to remove me and Lee from his care,” Corinna told the Herald Sun.  “Instead of that happening, my father offloaded myself and my brother with his mother, my grandmother.  “He came and picked us up a few weeks after the accident and he ended up keeping my brother and he returned me back to my grandmother.  “I think it was too much for him to look after both of us so my brother was raised by him and I was raised by my grandmother.”"
gratefuldoe,36ydvo,bootscallahan,2,Sat May 23 05:23:30 2015 UTC,"Corinna said it wasn’t until she was about five that she was told her mother had died in a car accident.  As she got older, she started picking her father’s brains for information about her mother.  “I was told she had met my father in Castlemaine in 1972. They sort of hit it off from there,” Corinna said.  “I think she was working in the woollen mills in Castlemaine.

So they never got married.  “I think I was about 17 when I started realising I could search for the whereabouts of my mother’s family because we didn’t know anything about her and I was curious.  “Obviously I didn’t know then she was under a different identity so all the searching I did was under the surname Russell.  “I started following up what little information she had given my father, which was basically just that her father was called Alexander and that he had worked in the transport, meat or trucking industries.  “I used to spend hours in the public records office going through electoral rolls and other documents.  “I paid a private investigator 13 years ago to follow up some leads, but they turned out to be bogus.  “All my searches under my mother’s name of Pauline Russell and her father’s name of Alexander Russell all came to dead ends. Nothing made sense.”  The breakthrough didn’t come until March this year.  It would have been Corinna’s mother’s birthday on March 6 and each year that date motivated Corinna to try searching again for details of her mother and her past.  This time she decided to try a different tack by looking at the website of the National Missing Persons Coordination centre, which is operated by the AFP.  She did so in the slim hope somebody who didn’t know Pauline Russell was dead had filed a missing person report at some stage in the past. The entry in the missing persons register.  The entry in the missing persons register.  Corinna was browsing through the missing person reports when she stumbled on the historic and unsolved case of Tamara Milograd.  She was immediately struck by how much the photograph on the website of Tamara looked like photographs she had seen of her mother Pauline.  “The photograph of Tamara just popped up on my screen and I just saw something familiar in it,” Corinna said.  “I didn’t know for sure it was my mother, but the more I looked at the photograph the more I decided it did strongly resemble my mother.  “But there were doubts in my mind as I was too young when my mother died to remember what she looked like and I had only ever seen four photographs of my mother and they weren’t the best quality. They weren’t very clear.”  The website said Tamara Milograd went missing in 1971 at the age of 15.  That threw Corinna a bit as from what she knew of her mother she would have been 18 in 1971.  “It was only once I started reading the AFP website about Tamara’s Russian heritage, her date of birth, which was the same as my mother but just a different year of birth, and the time frame of Tamara going missing in 1971, which fitted roughly around the 1975 year when I was born, that things started to fit,” Corinna said.  She persisted and googled the name Tamara Milograd and found media reports from 2010 from when Tamara was the face of National Missing Persons Week.  “Eugene Milograd was quoted in one of the articles mentioning that his father had passed away in 1989 without knowing what had happened to his daughter,” Corinna said.  “So I did a cemetery search on Milograd and found out Tamara’s father’s name was Alexander.  “That was another trigger for me to think this missing woman Tamara might be my mother Pauline because my mother had told my father her father’s name was Alexander.  “Another indication I could be on the right track was that my mother’s middle name was Tammy, which could be a shortened version of Tamara.” Family members reunited (L-R) Uncles Nick, Eugene and Alex Milograd, with Corinna Russell  Family members reunited (L-R) Uncles Nick, Eugene and Alex Milograd, with Corinna Russell and Grandmother Luba. Picture Norm Oorloff  Armed with more than just a few coincidences, Corinna then decided to email her father with a copy of the photograph of Tamara from the missing persons website.  “I asked him to have a look at it and asked him if he thought this person could be his former partner, my mother Pauline,” Corinna said.  “He got one of his friends who knew Pauline to also look at the photograph and they both said they thought it was a photograph of Pauline.  “I showed it to my grandmother, who also knew Pauline, and she also said she believed it was my mother.  “And an aunty, my father’s sister, saw it and said she was 110 per cent certain it was a photograph of Pauline.”  It was at this point that Corinna walked into her local police station and told the officer at the counter: “I think this photograph of a missing person is my mother and she’s deceased and I wonder if the family of the missing person is still looking for her.”  Corinna was put in touch with the Victoria Police cold case and missing persons squad.  The squad’s acting detective sergeant Peter Tasiopoulos and detective senior constable Kane Taylor took DNA from Corinna and Tamara’s brother, Nick Milograd.  They sent the samples off to be tested and compared at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine, which looks after the force’s missing person DNA database.  Within days the fast-tracked DNA results showed Corinna’s suspicions were right — Tamara Milograd and Pauline Tammy Russell were one and the same person.  So Corinna found out she had three uncles and a grandmother she wasn’t aware off in the shape of Luba Milograd and her sons Eugene, Nick and Alex and the Milograds discovered the grim news their loved one was dead.  Meeting them for the first time earlier this month in the Newport home her mother Tamara had run away from almost 44 years earlier was an emotional moment for Corinna.  “I brought my niece with me, my brother’s daughter, as well as my daughter Shandelle, who is 13, and my partner Trevor and an in-law,” Corinna said. DNA testing and a persistent daughter cracked the case.  DNA testing and a persistent daughter cracked the case.  “We just walked through the front door and met all the Milograds.  “I was very nervous, but excited at the same time.  “I felt really comfortable with them all. We’ve all got a lot in common, a lot of genetics. We’re family.”  Tamara’s brother Eugene Milograd said that first meeting with Corinna and her family produced mixed reactions.  “As a family we have always presumed Tamara was alive because there were no reports to the contrary from police or anyone else,” he told the Herald Sun.  “As far as we knew she just ran away and because there had been sightings that were reported we didn’t believe anything bad had happened to her.  “So it came as a shock when the DNA tests proved it was Tamara who died in the car accident in 1976.  “It was a conclusion as to what happened to her, but not one that we wanted.  “It was sort of bitter sweet in a way in that learning Tamara was dead saddened us but that sadness was balanced with the good news that we had found relatives we didn’t know existed.  “It was like coming to the end of one journey but the start of a new journey, having found Corinna and her family.”  Eugene Milograd said Tamara was a troubled young girl when she ran away as a 15-year-old in 1971.  “She was living a double life, one in the family, however, also skipping school and associating with unknown friends,” he said.  “She climbed out of her bedroom window and ran away on an earlier occasion, but she came back that time. Corinna has a special relationship with her long-lost grandmother Luba. Picture Norm Oorl  Corinna has a special relationship with her long-lost grandmother Luba. Picture Norm Oorloff  “Tamara became very withdrawn shortly before she ran away in 1971. She didn’t gel with the family so much.  “We were all distraught when she didn’t come home from her trip to the Royal Melbourne Show.  “We reported her missing to police and the police gave me a letter to get me into the show and I went out there and asked around about her and searched for her.  “There were sightings of her after that.  “A school friend said he saw her dancing at the Tarmac Hotel in Laverton."
gratefuldoe,36ydvo,velocitygirl17,2,Sat May 23 05:23:45 2015 UTC,"“Other reports said she was working in a milk bar in St Kilda and that she was living in Springvale.  “Information came in to us and police in dribs and drabs for months after she went missing.  “We went to all the places where there had been supposed sightings, including going to Springvale Town Hall to a dance there to see if we could see Tamara.  “We went around with a photograph of Tamara in St Kilda, along Fitzroy St, to see if someone remembered her.  “My parents went to Sydney looking for her after some sort of sighting up there.  “This went on for years. We never gave up hope of finding her.  “The hunt culminated in 2010 with the big push during National Missing Persons week.  “Tamara’s case and photograph featured on all the TV news programs and in the newspapers.  “We really had our hopes up at that time that either she would contact us or police to let us know she was safe or somebody with news of her would come forward, but it came to nothing.  “Then Corinna turned up five years later and through her diligence and DNA we now know the truth of what happened to Tamara.”  Luba Milograd still gets tears in her eyes when she talks about the day her daughter Tamara went to the show and didn’t come back.  “She told me she was going to the show with two girlfriends,” Luba, 90, recently told the Herald Sun.  “I was concerned so said I would go with them but she said ‘Oh Mum, it wouldn’t be interesting for you, I am going with the girls’ and then she went.  “Come darkness she hadn’t come back. I was very worried.  “During the night I thought I heard a ring on the door. I got up and opened the door, hoping to see Tamara. Nobody there, it was my imagination.  “I couldn’t sleep all night. Come daylight, still no return.

I miss her.”  Acting Det-Sgt Tasiopoulos said it was incredibly moving to accompany Corinna Russell and her family as she met the Milograds for the first time shortly after he told both families about the DNA result.  “You couldn’t help but be excited for them,” he said.  “There was emotion you could see on the Milograds, especially the grandmother, Luba.  “I could also sense instantaneous closure for Corinna because, after years of searching, she had finally achieved this great result.  “She had found her mother’s family.”"

gratefuldoe,36ksv4,lbr218,3,Wed May 20 02:53:37 2015 UTC,"I was on reddit during the Boston marathon bombing aftermath, and I was on the catch the boston marathon bomber sub. I didn't comment, just watched. I found it fascinating.   There was an amazing amount of information coming in. It was raw, you had to take it for what it was. But there we're people that just ran with it, I had no idea if they knew what they we're talking about or not. The funny thing is mainstream media was using some of the information for they're own stories.   This was all new to me. I realized the potential in crowd sourcing (I don't think I was aware what it was called at that time) but I also was concerned about talking like that on a public forum, especially one that big.   What they did and said, to a certain extent, is what L.E. does in private. You need to come up with all possibilites so it's out there for the people your working with to keep in mind. Some of the stuff is highly unlikely but stranger things have happened.  Some things are going to make people thing your cold, uncaring and disrespectful of victims, suspects and their families when in reality it's the opposite. But you need to be brutally honest when talking about possibilities if you hope to solve the case.   I view that as a lesson learned. I don't say that lightly, it was horrible for the Trapathi family and that can't be changed. No amount of apologies are going to make it better. But to condemn the process overall isn't right. It has great potential and would be irrersponsible to say it has failed and should never be used again.  Law Enforcement whether they like it or not does not have the resources to solve every case. As much as some of them would like to they just can't.   Crowd sourcing for now is the best thing to provide those needed resources. There are two big reasons most of L.E. doesn't want to involve groups like ours. One is they feel the general public should not be involved in what they do and that other is things like the marathon bomber subreddit.   I believe they are starting to understand that not all groups are the same and see the advantage of groups like ours. The detective in Albuquerque has been very helpful and it seems he is appreciative of what we are doing. Let's face it, a case that is solved is one off their books and that benefits them also.    The key is to earn the respect of the L.E. community, make a good name for ourselves. Be professional, respectful and trustworthy. It will happen, it just takes time."

I would say 4 inches or more is probably enough to eliminate someone (no one would mix up a 5'3"" woman for a 5'7"" one) but 2 is probably within reason.  As well, this is morbid but might not a hanging victim possibly gain a bit of height in their neck post-mortem?

gratefuldoe,35twvg,dragthewaters91,1 point,Wed May 13 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"It is quite possible that he was drunk rather than on drugs ( he could have been totally sober). I lean toward the idea of LSD simply because it had made a comeback in the 1990s and was super easy and cheap to get. As a teenager in the 1990s I had a much easier time finding acid than alcohol. But, it's all just speculation."
gratefuldoe,35twvg,Maude_13,1 point,Wed May 13 18:08:56 2015 UTC,"It's possible. And it would explain the whole ""fugitive"" thing. Interestingly enough, I don't think we ever discussed LSD/other hallucinogens as a possible cause of River Guy's behavior.  I guess the weirdest thing in this whole JCD thing is, who were the last people he was with, and why didn't they come forward? Drugs are usually a social thing. If you're drinking or tripping on acid it's usually with other people around, not to mention you have to get them from somewhere."
gratefuldoe,35twvg,dragthewaters91,1 point,Wed May 13 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"That's what gets me too. Given that he is believed to have been a teen/young adult, and probably wasn't from the area, that leads me to believe that he knew someone who lived there. He was either staying with friends/family or he was transient and was just passing through. Perhaps he had met someone at a show and was just crashing with them for a few days.  If he was partying with local people and ended up somehow getting separated from them and then ended up dead, this might be why no one has come forward. If they were involved with drug use/illegal behavior of some kind maybe whoever he was with doesn't want to incriminate themselves. Or maybe they knew him casually and they thought he had just left.

gratefuldoe,35ck8i,missxfebruary,2,Sat May 9 00:23:19 2015 UTC,"From the article:  ""(CNN)A lone holdout led to a mistrial Friday in the New York case against the man charged with the 1979 killing of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy whose disappearance sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children.  The jury sent State Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley a note -- the third since April 29 -- saying it was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the guilt or innocence of bodega worker Pedro Hernandez.  On two previous occasions, including Tuesday and Friday, the judge ordered the jury to keep deliberating.  A court hearing has been set for June 10 to set a date for a new trail.  One member of the jury of seven men and five women -- who identified himself only as Adam, juror No. 11 -- told reporters he held out against conviction.  ""Ultimately, I couldn't find enough evidence that wasn't circumstantial to convict,"" he said. ""I couldn't get there.""  The juror described the deliberations as respectful but sometimes heated.  A man identified as juror No. 3 urged prosecutors to retry the case. Juror No. 1, Alian Pahhan, shouted to reporters as she left a news conference.  ""Nothing's impossible,"" she said. ""They'll get him next time ... Pedro Hernandez, you know what you did.""  'Haunted by demons""  Stanley Patz, father of the victim, said he remains sure of Hernandez's guilt.  ""I'm so convinced that Pedro Hernandez kidnapped and killed my son,"" he told reporters. ""He's a guilty man who's been conscience-stricken due to his deeds and haunted by demons ever since that day.""  Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said he was disappointed there was a hung jury but was prepared to defend his client in the event of another trial.  ""Pedro's reaction is a very simple one: 'Does that mean I don't have to come back on Monday?'"" Fishbein said. ""Pedro is not a keen and cunning individual. Pedro is not a planner. Pedro is not someone who would spend 35 years avoiding criminal prosecution. Pedro is not the person that should be on trial in this case.""  In a statement, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said there is ""clear and corroborated evidence of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.""  ""The challenges in this case were exacerbated by the passage of time, but they should not, and did not, deter us,"" he said.  Vance also thanked Patz's family for the ""courage and determination they have shown over the past 36 years.""  ""The legacy they have built in the four decades since this tragedy occurred, both in raising awareness about the plight of missing children and through the creation of laws to protect them, has made our city, and our society, safer for children.""  'This man did it'  Hernandez confessed to police three years ago, but his lawyers said he made up his account of the crime.  ""We have now seen the confession,"" Stanley Patz said. ""My family has seen the confession many times. So it's no longer as shocking but it's still just chilling. This man did it. He said it. How many times does a man have to confess before someone believes him?""  Etan's parents have waited more than 35 years for justice, but some have questioned whether that is even possible in Hernandez's case. His lawyer has said he is mentally challenged, severely mentally ill and unable to tell whether he committed the crime.  Hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured Etan into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in Lower Manhattan. He said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag.  Severe mental illness?  Neither the child nor his remains have been recovered.  Hernandez has been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, one of a group of conditions informally thought of as ""eccentric"" personality disorders. He has an ""IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,"" his attorney Harvey Fishbein has said.  Police interrogated Hernandez for 7½ hours before he confessed.  ""I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan. But that doesn't mean he actually did, and that's the whole point of this case,"" Fishbein has said.  In November, a New York judge ruled that Hernandez's confession and his waiving of his Miranda rights were legal, making the confession admissible in court.  Hernandez is charged with two counts of second-degree murder for allegedly intending to cause the boy's death and for a killing that occurred during a kidnapping.  Another suspect?  Another man's name has also hung over the Etan Patz case for years: Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Etan's parents, Stan and Julia Patz, sued Ramos in 2001. The boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit.  A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million, money the Patz family has not received.  Though Ramos was at the center of investigations for years, he has never been charged. He served a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012.  He was immediately rearrested upon leaving jail in 2012 on charges of failing to register as a sex offender, The Associated Press reported.  Since their young son's disappearance, the Patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the United States.  In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused on the search for him and other missing children.  ""It awakened America,"" said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. ""It was the beginning of a missing children's movement.""  The number of children who are kidnapped and killed has remained steady -- it has always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases has skyrocketed, experts said.  The news industry was expanding to cable television, and sweet images of children appeared along with distraught parents begging for their safe return. The fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police.  In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.  President Ronald Reagan opened the center in a White House ceremony in 1984. It soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls."""
gratefuldoe,35cnoc,happenstanced,4,Sat May 9 00:56:52 2015 UTC,"If there are enough people, it might be nice to organize groups to look for/compare missing persons cases - but to do so in specific regions. As in, the north eastern US, south eastern US, Midwest, etc. A group would look specifically in certain states, on all MP websites/databases.  It would also be nice to have a master list of candidates/potential matches & the similarities to the specific Doe cases they're potentially connected to. Sort of a pro/con list per possible match for each Doe. It would take a lot of effort so maybe a few people could work on making and updating it?"
gratefuldoe,35cnoc,dragthewaters91,2,Sat May 9 07:24:26 2015 UTC,"Hey well, people have kind of been doing this already, but it would be great to have a group on each case for social media, a group for missing persons, a group for local outreach if applicable (ie. if people from the area are on this group), yearbook searches if applicable. Just to make sure there isn't any redundant work being done. The missing persons cases could be divided up by year, for example.  And maybe we could do more outreach by contacting homeless shelters in the area or something (I'm thinking for FCJD specifically but it could work for other future cases too)? Asking them to put up posters in the shelter in case anyone recognizes them? Stuff like that? Publicizing on the internet is one thing, but I think Grateful Doe was a one-in-a-million lucky break (honestly if you think about it, it kind of was, his friends didn't even know he was missing).  For example Jack and volunteers are planning to do a lot of local outreach for JCD in the future, like publicizing the case at local metal shows, contacting metalhead-looking people from the yearbook searches who are confirmed alive and asking if they recognize him, etc. Of course it helps being from the area, and having a PI license."

How do I know I'm not just reinventing the wheel here? (or I guess, reinventing the steel, given my username)  I do think more local outreach would be great though, if possible. ""Baby Hope"" was identified just by cops going around the neighborhood and asking around again, even though they had asked around when she was found initially. People were more willing to talk after 20 years."

gratefuldoe,35cnoc,hollyinnm,2,Sat May 9 02:37:13 2015 UTC,"Just a few suggestions and comments I'd like to make on this topic.  Participation should always be optional, and working individually should never be discouraged. The flexibility and independence is necessary for the health,well being and success of this sub.  I think work groups can ease the burden and make us more efficient and effective by creating more experienced active participants and providing us with a more structured approach.  Working with a group will allow anyone that doesn't feel comfortable enough to do it on their own the ability to become involved by providing support and guidance.  It will ensure a particular issue was investigated completely. You can have a person for each aspect so everything about that issue is known and documented. That should also prevent others from covering the same ground.   Adding to that it will provide us with a systematic approach to advancing our investigation. It will be a lot easier to see what been completed and where we need to go.   It will give you a chance to step away if you need to knowing that someone will pick up where you left off. Your work will not go undone because you needed to focus on real life problems. And I know, I've been there and tried do both, I learned the hard way that I shouldn't have.   This sub, the people that are part of it and the way we interact is very unique. The ethics, compassion and dedication shown is inspiring and humbling.  I am very grateful to have the opportunity to be part of this. You could not recreate this no matter how hard you try, all the right ingredients came together perfectly at the right time. I not only want to see this sub continue I also want it become very successful. We have what it takes for that to happen but we need to utilize it properly."

gratefuldoe,357lzn,Doctor_StrangeLuv,2,Thu May 7 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That does provide some insight, though I had read and forgot about it I think.  Do people typically use their real names when checking in with a prostitute? And for that matter... The point they make is pretty valid- she would have been known locally, certainly.   I've always had this image in my head about the day they took that photo booth picture. Her expression is sort of... ""Oh wow I look so different with this red hair wooooow!"" And his face says ""I told you it was a good idea, and yeah you look pretty damn hot.""  So say they were traveling together for some reason. Probably romantically or at least sexually involved. What reason would they have to travel? Dying her hair says ""running"" to me. Away from what though,  parents? School? The law?"
gratefuldoe,357lzn,hollyinnm,2,Thu May 7 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"I love the theory for some reason. It gives her life. Anyways, It's very possible though she just dyed her hair because she thought it looked better. Maybe shed always dyed her hair a reddish color."
gratefuldoe,35578p,happenstanced,5,Thu May 7 05:09:11 2015 UTC,"Very solid match definitely worth pursuing. A couple things that jump out at me:   the 60-lb weight difference  - though one can certainly lose weight. plus it was mentioned that AJD's pants were too big for her, which would support a weight loss theory this woman's very distinctive chin. I feel like there is no trace of that chin in any of the AJD images but weird stuff happens to your face when you die, and when you lose weight.  The AJD detective said she had no distinguishing marks or scars; this woman has moles and a scar.    But there are no major excluding details I can see that make me think it definitely couldn't be her and a lot that line up.  Great find.

I see she had a crystal pendant and a marble held by talons, which, some Wiccans may use pendants like that for protection or love, etc. - but IMO this girl was your typical 90s teenager who probably bought them when they were a popular fad (I know I had stuff like that in the mid 90s, but not for being a witch, moreso because I found them at Spencers, they were popular, and I wanted to ""look cool"" lol)"

The fact this guy couldn't be identified despite him dying between minutes of being found is a real oddity to me, especially his weird little poem he carried on and this mysterious final line ""don't fuck with the dragons"" - which for some reason strongly remained in my mind like a catchphrase. I imediatly thought it could be the final rambling of an intoxicated man (It recalled me of the famous expression ""chasing the dragon"" - so this could be the metaphor of hard drugs consumption) but I wonder if this hasn't a darker origin ; like fleeing from a gang nicknamed ""the dragons"" after some conflict which resulted in his final decision to take his own life.

I believe she has not been reported missing either because the police didn't accept the report (this happens way too often) or because the family/friends didn't notice she had gone missing (this has happened when the Doe and their relatives have lost contact years ago), or because the family/friends don't trust the police enough to report her missing (basically any country where police is not trusted in).

gratefuldoe,34vv0w,callmeice,2,Tue May 5 11:36:33 2015 UTC,Would selling about $1000 of personal items (assets) count as income during taxes?
gratefuldoe,34vv0w,TVConefive,1 point,Tue May 5 04:59:33 2015 UTC,"You mean you didn't file your income tax yet? :)  I found this Forbes article that explains it in plain English. I'm sure you will get different answers since the tax laws are confusing but I think this is what applies to you.   Sales of personal items – meaning those things you own for personal use – are generally taxable as capital gains. Personal items include not only the big stuff, like your car and your sofa, but also the little stuff like your old clothing, your dinnerware and your well worn copies of Frampton Comes Alive and Saturday Night Fever.  If you sell those things and you make money, you would report those items as a capital gain. Capital gain is the difference between the selling price and the basis (usually, the purchase price). If you do hit the yard sale jackpot and make money on the sale of your personal items or items held for investment (like a coin collection or collector’s item), you would report the gain on your federal form 1040 at Schedule D.  That said, you don’t have to be a retail genius to figure that in almost every case, the selling price of your personal items – no matter how precious your rainbow-striped shirt from the 1980s was to you – is likely significantly less than what you paid for it. Realistically, selling your treasures won’t likely result in an actual taxable gain, even if you have cash in hand at the end of the day."
gratefuldoe,34vv0w,callmeice,2,Tue May 5 06:00:13 2015 UTC,"I filed! I was just curious as I had been selling a few things, not even near to a thousand's worth however.  The only way I'm interpreting this due to the last paragraph is that it only matters if you profit from the purchase price compared to your sold price. Am I right?  Also I think this whole idea is BS unless it is a straight up profit like flipping a house. If I found all my state quarters in my change and sold the complete collectors' book, I always owned that amount of money, the object always had that value. I mean, how would it work if I had a lot of assets in gold; gold fluctuates in price greatly sometimes. If the price rose sharply, should that not be considered a gain in personal assets? I'd technically have received more money. Or is that something where investments come in? But what if I had only been collecting gold dollars from yonder period of time as a hobby? I hate taxes."
gratefuldoe,34vv0w,callmeice,2,Fri May 8 04:22:38 2015 UTC,"That's the way I understand it.  I think with the quarters your selling them at face value so you broke even, no profit or loss. If you found the quarters and sold them for anything, even a penny, you made a profit.  I believe with gold assets your profit or loss is at the time you sell so fluctuation while you own it doesn't matter.  With any of this it comes down to profit. I wouldn't worry about the IRS hunting you down for little stuff like this, it's too much trouble for them and too hard to prove a profit was made. If it became a business then it's a different story."

gratefuldoe,34vv0w,-Urbex-,3,Tue May 5 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"I think a key to Grateful Doe is that Jason Callahan hung out with people in Illinois who were young enough to be a part of the generation that accepted the internet as a normal part of everyday life. So then it was just a matter of hitting the right social media platform to reach them.   The older the case is, the older the people are that might recognize the Doe. So let's say a Doe roughly 25 years old goes appears in 1990. By 2015, his friends would be around 50. His parents would be even older.  From my own personal experience, this is a generation that is not on the internet as frequently.  Sure, they may have a Facebook page but they are probably not browsing reddit or Imgur.

As for the guy in the photo with her, I am just not getting an Irish vibe from him.   There are lots of girls who disappeared around the 90s. Ireland has a rather high rate for missing people, for a small country.  I suppose, if I was to think off the top of my head, the closest resemblance she has to a missing Irish person would be Deirdre Jacob or else Ciara Breen. Except they disappeared after ABJ was found.  There is a better website for missing people here:  http://www.missingpersons.ie   The sad thing is, we don't have a decent system here, like NamUs, so there are a lot of missing people who are just not looked into properly, or else their details are not freely available. :-(  It's not cheap to travel to America from here, so she would have to have quite a bit of money to travel to the US.

Also she facially doesn't look like AJD to me. Deborah Poe --- She looks like she could work, though a little short, but the circumstances don't fit either. It really sounds like she was taken or kidnapped. Amanda Fravel --- her NamUs profile looks great, but if you go to her Doe network file they say she was short, and it really sounds like she met foul play not long after her disappearance.  Lora Mclntire --- she had had a 6 year old kid so that doesn't fit AJD. Mellisa Burgess --- no info on dissaperance but she looks like she could be a good match.   These are just my opinions, so take them with a grain of salt. Not to mention any lead or person is worth looking into"

I'm not a social media person though. I am working on the subreddit thing with a few others.   The post don't get many comments but it only takes one person to see it. Someone may also decide to link it to a more local site from the city subreddit.   I'm trying to make it easy so you can just copy and paste but reddit is destroying my efforts.

gratefuldoe,33seuf,dragthewaters91,18,Sat Apr 25 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"Dear Callahan family,  I am sure you know by now that many of us on this subreddit and many places elsewhere on the internet have been following the case of Grateful Doe for a long time, trying to identify him and publicize his case. There is even one person on this subreddit who has been trying to identify him since 1996. From the time I first read about Grateful Doe in October 2013, I wanted to do everything possible to help bring him home and give him his identity back. I checked every day for updates, looked for potential matches among missing persons, and even assisted in getting his case profiled in the Huffington Post in 2014.  Obviously none of us know for sure at this point, although we may have our beliefs, whether Grateful Doe and Jason are one and the same. But nevertheless, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we have all been touched by Jason's story and the description of him and his life that we have learned from the people who knew him. His friends described him as a carefree, happy-go-lucky person who was not afraid to live life to the fullest, who engaged his roommates in philosophical debates and believed he could communicate with trees. Many of us on this subreddit commented on how genuinely happy he looked in all his photos. Many of us have felt like we have gotten to know him to some extent through what has been shared about his life. Of course we all wish we could have gotten to know him in life.  If Jason does turn out to be Grateful Doe, it is a consolation to know he lived the life he wanted to live before he passed away. However, it is obviously immeasurably heartbreaking that such a happy person with so much ahead of him, who had so much to offer the world and so much to enjoy in life, had his life tragically cut short under circumstances out of his control. But I speak for all of us when I say that his memory will live on not only in the hearts of those who knew him, but also in the hearts of everyone who has worked to bring him home over the last 20 years.  In any case, no matter the results, I hope that you and your family find the answers you need about what happened to Jason. And know that you have the support of everyone here."

gratefuldoe,33seuf,Donotclosetheblinds,5,Sat Apr 25 07:57:22 2015 UTC,"Drag said everything I would have liked to say,  except much clearer and more eloquently.   Many of us have commented here and elsewhere that Jason has such a  sweet,  kind face and we would have loved to know him personally. No matter the outcome, I hope it brings Jason's family a little bit of comfort knowing that hundreds, if not thousands, of people all over the world have thought so warmly of him."
gratefuldoe,33seuf,TVConefive,5,Sat Apr 25 09:06:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think I could possibly say it better.   My heart has always gone out to grateful doe, and further, to Jason. He and I were about the same age that year, and we had similar friends. We lived a similar lifestyle. So much so, that I was slated to go to that last show. I even wonder, at times, if we met. Because he seems so familiar. But that's a sentiment a lot of people share... he's like an archetype. He feels friendly and familiar. We all have so much love for him."
gratefuldoe,33seuf,-Urbex-,2,Sat Apr 25 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"I believe the above comment says it all.    I would also hope that they remember that the internet is full of jerks.  Full of people who always know exactly how they would have handled the situation differently, full of people who are judgmental.    I would hope that the family that has come forward who may have looked for years but didn't know about Grateful Doe and never had a way to connect the two can look past that small group who judge.  Please know that there are a far bigger majority that don't care what the circumstances were and only care that Grateful Doe gets a family and that family gets closure.    My prayers are with the family!"
gratefuldoe,33seuf,TVConefive,2,Sat Apr 25 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"To Jason's family, friends and loved ones,  I've been looking at this post for almost two days wanting to say something, but can't find the right words. And I know I'm not the only one, I've been here since the beginning and I know how everyone here truly feels about Grateful Doe and Jason. The most important things are always the hardest things to say.  Although we don't yet know if Jason is Grateful Doe, I believe everyone who has seen the pictures and knows his story understands the probability and are preparing themselves for the results. So if it turns out the way we think, there are some things I would like to say.  Many of us have known about Grateful Doe for years. Being a Grateful Dead fan myself I felt a connection and a desire to do something, but there was also something else, at the time and I didn't know what it was.Then one day I saw another post about Jason Doe. I always read them but this one was different, the person posting it had a real passion ""I am grasping at straws. I am looking for anything that makes Jason make sense to me. I turn to you for the help I need.....I don't know why Jason has stuck with me for so long. I don't know why I feel heavy in my chest when I think about him. I don't know what I am hoping to achieve from posting here..but I felt that it needed to be done.""  I knew what the something else I was feeling was, it's also the first time I realized there was something unique about him.  It wasn't just me. This group formed because most of us had the same strong desire to help. We clicked, and quickly started working together to help this young man find peace. We gave all we could even though many of had never done anything like this before.  Then the first pictures of Jason appeared and just stunned everyone. There was an immediate change in the air while we tried to understand what we were seeing.    Our focus immediately shifted and everyone felt a strong connection to Jason. We wanted to know all we could and the desire to find out who he really was and get him home again grew stronger. Our hearts ached for him and for his family who didn't know yet. Everyone worked even harder, then one day we finally had what we believe is the answer. The mixed emotions for him and his family are just too hard to describe, in the end I think most of us just felt drained.   It's been 20 years yet Jason continues too make this world a better place. It is directly because of him that this group exists. Because of that more people will be identified. He had such an impact on us that we decided to keep the grateful doe name as we move on in an attempt to help unknown souls and their loved ones. It's not because he was our first case. We had a discussion about this after we decided to continue what he brought us together to do. We were a little surprised when we realized that the name grateful doe describes exactly who we are and what we hope to accomplish. It was almost as if this was predetermined and we were brought together for a reason.  And because of him we are a family of like minded people. We work well together and are always looking for more to join us. We have made new friends, lifelong friends and even best friends. We will never forget him and are eternally grateful too him for making all of our lives a little better, and little more meaningful.   We're always here for you. You can always stop by and talk, and if you decide to join us it would even be better. I hope were wrong and Jason shows up tomorrow, but if this is him I hope you'll find some comfort in knowing how much good he has done and the positive impact he continues to have on people that never had a chance to know him."

gratefuldoe,33shsk,-Urbex-,1 point,Sat Apr 25 04:45:57 2015 UTC,A DNA comparison has been made and FCJD is NOT missing person Jason O'Donaghey.  Another exclusion.
gratefuldoe,33nmen,blackinkonly,2,Fri Apr 24 00:06:41 2015 UTC,Interesting article. So...they knew it was the husband and yet he moved to FL?
gratefuldoe,33nmen,0hfuck,2,Fri Apr 24 06:21:21 2015 UTC,When did he confess? That's kind of bizarre.   Either way I'm glad her family knows what happened to her and can bring her home.
gratefuldoe,33nmen,dragthewaters91,1 point,Fri Apr 24 13:22:03 2015 UTC,It sounds like it was a deathbed-type confession?
gratefuldoe,33nmen,nevershagagreek,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"According to this, you are correct - it was more or less a deathbed confession.  That article also states he claimed to have buried in her Mississippi.  So either he forgot in his old age or he was lying about at least part of it."
gratefuldoe,33nokf,fuzzyfezzy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:26:19 2015 UTC,While looking I found a woman named Nicola Payne who went missing in the UK. There are quite a few pictures if you Google her... she looks a lot like our doe. Or am I crazy? http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/nicola-payne-accused-due-back-8541786
gratefuldoe,33nokf,kid775,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"Not at all, we are keeping open minded about where she could have come from right now :)  Do you want to link to a profile? I can have a look when I get home!"
gratefuldoe,33nokf,fuzzyfezzy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'm having difficulty finding a profile. Just lots of articles. But, I just read the medical report and she had a baby- and jane has not so I guess she's out."
gratefuldoe,33nokf,kid775,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:10:11 2015 UTC,it's really not hard to cover up an unwanted baby.
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,-Urbex-,3,Thu Apr 23 17:06:26 2015 UTC,What a fascinating idea.  The fact that the t was signed like a cross has always struck me as odd. It could totally be a signature or affectation.
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,Doctor_StrangeLuv,2,Thu Apr 23 22:25:21 2015 UTC,"seems a little out there (that the scale was signed by a band member), but the idea that they may have been following AC/DC seems possible. Either way, any possible ideas are worth looking into, imo. I'll look into it too."
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,Doctor_StrangeLuv,2,Thu Apr 23 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"There is speculation she may have been foreign, and the tour started in New Zealand."
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,myfakename68,2,Thu Apr 23 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, it might be an ""out there theory"" but when we/LE do not have anything to really go on... what is the harm of tossing out another idea?  I mean, if the good detectives here on Grateful Doe look into it and not bug LE until we have some solid ""facts,"" I see  nothing wrong w/ any thoughts/theories/ideas!"
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,Doctor_StrangeLuv,2,Thu Apr 23 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, neither do I. As I said, I think even the craziest theories are worth looking into."
gratefuldoe,33m3hc,dfcope,2,Thu Apr 23 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know about ""following"" the band but if there was a show in  Albuquerque  it would draw people from nearby cities/states. As a for instance ( because I grew up in the Midwest) if there was a big show in Omaha NE you'd draw people from  South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and may be as far away is North Dakota. Additionally, the scale...they don't call it sex, drugs and rock & roll for nothing. Especially in the 70's, 80's and 90's. Can anyone think of another use for a scale in a hotel room in the early 90's?"

gratefuldoe,33ipj0,kid775,3,Sun Apr 26 19:45:29 2015 UTC,That first one looks like WOW so close. But... Wouldn't he have aged more?
gratefuldoe,33ipj0,VanessaClarkLove,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"In seven years? Maybe not. My own dad doesn't look like hes changed much in the past twenty years. Also he does appear to be older and have gained a little weight. But I agree, the first one... is really similar if not him."
gratefuldoe,33ipj0,dfcope,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"Hm you have a point, and it really really looks like him."
gratefuldoe,33ipj0,TVConefive,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:25:36 2015 UTC,"yea, not to mention he was booked in New Mexico, and from what we know, it wouldn't be a surprise if he'd been arrested. Unfortunately even if it is him, which I personally have a strong feeling it is, it's sort of a dead end anyways."
gratefuldoe,33ipj0,zombiegrey,2,Wed Apr 22 23:28:29 2015 UTC,Why is it a dead end? Couldn't he be questioned?
gratefuldoe,33ipj0,TVConefive,2,Wed Apr 22 23:38:21 2015 UTC,"He could, but there is very little information given on him besides his name and date incarcerated. But I think its worth passing along to the investigator. But mostly I meant there is nothing we can individually do with this at this point."
