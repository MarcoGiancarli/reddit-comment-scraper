First thing you can do to get better, is practice tech skill. You need to have the technical prowess before you can start developing good habits with characters I.e punishing rolls and spot dodges.   Just keep playing, I've been playing smash since I was 4, im 16 now, just went to my first tourney and placed 6th in singles, 3rd in doubles. My tech skill is great but I have no strategies yet.   Just take it slow and play for fun, you will get better by fighting more and more. If you come across someone like that in FG, save the replays and analyze what you did wrong. Keep fighting him, win rate on for glory doesn't prove anything"

And oh man, you're in that golden age for gaming. That's impressive, 3rd in a first tourney! I don't think there's any competitive smash in Belgium.  I'm 26 now and I can feel my reactions fading :( Used to be really good at shooters, but now..! Cherish these next 10 years dude. ;)  But thanks for the advice.

That is clearly a kid glutting in the fact he's marginally better than you enough to win every time. If you want to ""GET GUD,"" you'll have to ignore this sort of thing.  16% win rate is pretty dismal depending on how long you've been playing. If the controls aren't second nature to you, beat up on CPU's until they are. Post video of your matches and ask everyone to tell you what you did wrong. And never leave an online lobby because someone is beating you. Rematch them until you pick up on something they do."

I personally find someone else to play against after I lose twice in a row, that way I can find someone who is on the same skill level.  If you have some spare time, take a look at Jtails, and AceStarthe3rd's videos to help give you ideas of how to improve.  Jtails's tutorial videos are very helpful.

You could be the next notable Mewtwo main if you put enough time into him and really learn the character.

Pikachu doesn't really have any bangers or smashes. The skullbash looks like a banger but it kind of is the worst pika attack.
sm4sh,3dwyrn,TowelstheTricker,3,Tue Jul 21 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"I'm a Zelda main. After the last patch, and after watching players like Nairo kick ass with her, I genuinely believe she is solidly mid-tier. She's built for wicked mind games, has a variety of kill options, and she is an anathema to zoning characters. I've always said that Zelda is a character who rewards skilled gameplay, and once you master her aerials and teleportation, you really are a force to be reckoned with. Plus, those Phantom Knights are fucking bomb. Of course, she obviously has flaws, but she's come a long way since Melee and Brawl.   Mostly, I wish that using Din's Fire mid-air wouldn't put her in free-fall. I also miss her old Brawl-style u-smash--it was vicious. A better jab would be wonderful, but I think I'm just getting greedy now. It really is a shitty jab, though. Like, it does nothing. At all."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,PrinceOfCups13,3,Mon Jul 20 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"Zelda is also my main. I love her jab for quicker spacing than idle+B without the dead movement after, but that's all it's really useful for.  I agree Din's Fire mid-air is terrifying and null mostly because of the sideways movement. If there was no free-fall her edge guarding & off-map game would be way OP, however."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,damagedfuckup,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:40 2015 UTC,We should trade Zelda tips. Have any you wanna share?
sm4sh,3dwyrn,PrinceOfCups13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:39 2015 UTC,Nothing you probably didn't already know. Always start matches aggressively- I love her fwrd+A approach and fall back on Nayru's Love if/when they counter. People don't typically expect a competent Zelda player so it takes them a minute to adjust. And the moment they do is when I start zoning the crap out of them.  Another thing people aren't familiar with is how seriously devastating the sweet spots in her aerial kicks are. The biggest advantage to using Zelda is the fact that not many people use Zelda.
sm4sh,3dwyrn,damagedfuckup,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, spoken like a competent Zelda main. The element of surprise is a huge help. I also like to start off aggressively. And yeah, once you learn how to sweet spot her aerials (including her up and down), you can really fuck shit up. I've been exploring her Phantom Knights lately, trying to find new and unexpected ways to use them."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,PrinceOfCups13,2,Tue Jul 21 18:19:22 2015 UTC,"As far as WFT and Robin are concerned, I can't say I would know how they should be buffed since I never played them.  But, 1 character comes to my mind when I think about buffs.  That Character is Little Mac, I feel like he needs a small buff in his recovery with Up-B.  Whenever he recovers and there is a small gap between his fist and the ledge he doesn't grab it.   I would love to see a buff in his ledge grab range when recovering with his Up b.  I tear up a little inside when I recover and miss the ledge by a 1 cm :("
sm4sh,3dwyrn,GooberGaming,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"Little Mac is a bit OP on the ground, so I can see why he'd knowingly be the only character without a full recovery. The price you pay, I suppose."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,damagedfuckup,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, his recovery should be his biggest flaw, but having that extra bit of grab range would be a huge QOL change.  Also, I feel that his weak recovery really deters players playing him on a competitive level :(."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,GooberGaming,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"For Wii Fit Trainer, I suggest more kill moves, as now she really only has one reliable one, (Being F-Smash) as well as making her down air better for spiking. Robin, I think needs Nosferatu to take less time to recharge and more times it can be used, and slightly increase Robin's speed.  Also, combo throws for both of them."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,noahk777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:11:38 2015 UTC,Palutena. She has aerials that auto cancel yet laggy startups on all her tilts. Give her a decent combo besides downthrow to nair or fair. Overall her punish game just needs to feel more rewarding. Counter is weird and laggy as well. I don't expect her to be as fast as fox or whatever but since her ground attacks are slow and laggy I'd just like more damage or knockback for landing them properly.
sm4sh,3dwyrn,siriusleenoctis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:21:49 2015 UTC,"Robin needs to be buffed substantially, she's such a cool character but she cannot compete at all against the higher tier characters. Making her faster would be really nice."
sm4sh,3dwyrn,MrTriHorse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:49 2015 UTC,Marth and Lucina NEED to either have less end lag on Fair to be able to link to tilts or be able to do something close to a ken combo IMO.
sm4sh,3dwyrn,No_NameSSB,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"I would be ecstatic if Mewtwo was buffed. I've been a huge fan of his since I first unlocked him in melee. From what I've seen in project m, he is a monster. But I'd like to see his tail based aerials a bit faster and have correct hitboxes. Less startup on neutral air and make the back half of his tail not a hurtbox, and maybe have his disable do more shield damage similar to pound but not quite as much. His weight can stay the same to balance him out but basically he needs more canon in the glass canon."

sm4sh,3dwyrn,ambi94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be a combo throw into side smash. I think if down throw had less knock back so that dthrow->nair worked before 50 damage and dthrow->fair worked after, that would help a lot."

I'm not sure what the cause was for this just when I started I instinctively pushed left than right to try it. You have an advantage with being left handed due to the thumb being naturally stronger and more coordinated - make the most of it
sm4sh,3dk6mv,Questen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"I'm left handed and I have more trouble going to left than right. I think it's dependent on where someone rests their thumb on the stick in neutral, as it's easier to flick one way than the other."

I'm a Bowser and Samus main and my win rate out of 7000 1v1 matches online is a bit over 73%, which is eh, but I also play the rest of the matches not made up by my main two with random other characters i'm not as good with, which can also just help with ideas for different ways to go about the ones who I consider my main. So yeah dude, just improve your method, and make sure that improvement includes adaptation and avoiding patterns!

sm4sh,3d01pl,Suicuneator,2,Sun Jul 12 09:48:29 2015 UTC,"I generally think it's bad, which is why I prefer Smash to other fighting games where there's a much larger emphasis on combos. It makes it less interactive with the other player.  That being said, with DI and %, most combos lose their potential. But also, D-throw F-Air F-Air isn't that much of a combo. Most characters have at least one move they can do out of a grab."
sm4sh,3d01pl,NeedsMoreReeds,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:49:02 2015 UTC,"Nah, I love my combos. And when people combo me, i mean its ok. The only ones that i find annoying are Roy's down throw to up-b which is 21 percent guaranteed, ness down throw to forward air which is getting easier to avoid with D.I., and marios downthrow to uptilt uptilt uptilt uptilt upb which is easily broken by mashing jump. However I do love marios up tilt combo when I'm performing it on others.  Toon Link's uptilt combo is a well designed one, because as you knock them further and further away with these hits, you can finish off with an up+b which is just demoralizing as all hell. Theres definitely some obvious movesets taht the game designers made to facilitate comboing. He also has some of the best projectile and throw combos.  I see what you mean by making it routine OP. Some players will play to get their combo opportunity and you will see how robotic it is. However some players will capitalize on the combo opportunity when it happens to comes to them.  ZSS, one of my favorites to play as recently, she has three moves that will incapacitate enemies and a very good precise kill move. If an opponent jumps at me, lands in front and catches my paralyzer shot, that opens up an opportunity for a very sexual conversion to down smash, prolonging the paralysis. Then Down B, if you're quick will pitfall them or if they pop out will spike them back down to the ground. An Up+B on a pitfalled enemy at 99ish percent has a high chance of killing half the roster of characters. You also suffer no knockback reduction since the final hit is in the air.   Almost as good as shield drop fart with wario, which isnt so much a combo but still the best move in the game."
sm4sh,3d01pl,Ransom-ii,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"I feels as if combos are good, if not important, for all fighting games. Without them the game becomes a series of pokes. Smash is a little different from other fighters though. In smash, you can escape your opponents combo with DI. Some combos don't even work in Smash unless the %age and match up is right. In Street Fighter or other traditional fighters you can't escape. Some fighters with do have abilities to break out of combos. They are normally hard to do or limited.   I know being caught in a combo is frustrating, I play Blazblue. Without them though the game lacks something you work your opponent into. The combo should be something you are looking for. We talk about punishes a lot in fighters. The punishing player is being rewarded though. He is using a combo to reliably build the damage on you. You made a mistake. If your opponent can't reliably do something off of said mistake, what was the point of wiating(or forcing you) to make it? As I said above, you both just sit there poking one another until one manages to get a kill move in at the required %age."
sm4sh,3d01pl,Lucarios_Butt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls has a system to prevent Infinite combos while still incentivizing them on most characters, which I think is pretty good.  Basically after you've taken a set amount of damage without being able to react , usually about 10 seconds or so of uninterrupted combo before it kicks in. Basically it just lets the player (regardless of character) that's getting beat on to press any button and it will instantly knock the enemy to the other side of the screen, ending the combo.   When the anti-infinite is triggered, hit sounds change and there's a special visual effect as well, so when it happens its pretty obvious.   While I like that system, I like Smash's system where  long combos are fairly few and far between, but devastating when pulled off."
sm4sh,3d01pl,Cubelord,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:30:39 2015 UTC,Most fighters have anti infinite things built into them. Mostly in the form of moves linking into less and less options until there are none.
sm4sh,3d01pl,Lucarios_Butt,2,Sun Jul 12 23:38:35 2015 UTC,"That's another good system, but the only real disadvantage of a system like that is you get certain go-to combos on every character.   In my opinion, the attacks all chain together a lot easier , with only a few attacks on each character that isn't somehow combo-able. This makes the hard anti-infinite system pretty smart in a game like that.   For me the most fun in fighting games are systems where its more improvised combos and on-the-fly strategy, which is why I like Zard in Smash. Nothing combos easily so it becomes rushing around and smacking people around in the air, which is really fun."
sm4sh,3d01pl,Cubelord,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"the only real disadvantage of a system like that is you get certain go-to combos on every character.   This is true. There are optimal combos for all SF characters.  And yeah, I love me some smash Zard too. PM Zard can suck it though."
sm4sh,3d01pl,Lucarios_Butt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:51:54 2015 UTC,"Improvised combos and on the fly strategy are why I love smash so much, I have a cousin who is a god at other fighting games but cannot wrap his head around smash... and I keep begging him to try, he got Sm4sh without me knowing, played ""less than 20 matches online"" then went and traded it back in. Almost broke my heart to hear that, I told him I do pretty good online he replied with ""good thing we never played then"" I'd have loved to help him get better at smash. But I think he was frustrated that he wasn't really good right away as smash is deceptively simple on the surface. I'm only good because I've been playing almost religiously since 64."

AFAIK, you can't utilt out of dash, but you can get an up smash with the timing right. I find its about the same as a pivot smash, so it's mostly just practice. Alternatively, you could try a jump cancelled up smash, which I feel is a bit easier to pull off."

sm4sh,3bxx1r,MobinMan,11,Fri Jul 3 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"Run and shield, great offensive/defensive options. Be patient and respect arials. Getting more than 2 hits out of a grab/hit is very uncommon, so don't go too ham.  Falcon is really good. In the edge, up tilt spikes. Dthrow to upair combos from 0 to 60. Grounded upair to knee true combo. Dair at 60% true combo to knee. Dash attack and dash grab can heavily punish a tech read because there it has so much range. And jab. The gentleman is so good and confirms at basically all percents. (You can hold A, and if it connects it will auto the gentleman.)  As for DI, just DI in the way that you're hit. Don't trust anything. There have been some rumors about how to DI, but after testing and research of a bunch of people. The replaced DI for what people now call vectoring.  Hope it helps some! Fell free to ask any questions.   Edit: forgot to explain DI"
sm4sh,3bxx1r,unchartedcubes,5,Fri Jul 3 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"Um, what? Since when was DI was replaced? From what I understand, SDI is barely in this game. DI still exists in the same way as Melee, and vectoring is in the horizontal direction as well. Can you please provide a source for that?"

sm4sh,3bxx1r,unchartedcubes,3,Fri Jul 3 05:53:28 2015 UTC,"I watched that video before, and the results are what I said in my post. DI still exists as in Melee, vectoring just masks it in the horizontal direction. DI was never replaced, and SDI is actually weaker now than it used to be to the point of it being negligible."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,Dapplegonger,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:00:15 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm just not understanding what you're saying. My apologies.
sm4sh,3bxx1r,unchartedcubes,2,Fri Jul 3 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with melee as well, could you explicitly say the mechanics changes? Like now from what I've seen I think you can jump after airdodging? Can you also use attacks out of airdodges?  And since ledge-hogging isn't a thing, how the heck do you edgeguard?  And finally for now, when you say DI in the way that you're hit, I've interpreted that in two ways  *1 You DI IN the direction you're hit. As in if you're forward smashed to the right of the screen, you DI right as well? Cause that sounds like crazy talk.  or  *2 You DI INTO the way you're hit, as in DI left when you're smashed right.  Thanks for the response, very much appreciated.  I'll probably have more questions as well."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,Emyks,4,Fri Jul 3 03:58:38 2015 UTC,"There's 2 kinds of DI in Sm4sh AFAIK.  If you are hit vertically (up or down), the best way to DI is melee-style, perpendicular (left or right) to influence the direction.  When hit horizontally (left or right), there is a mechanic called 'vectoring' which allows you to input a direction, and that direction is added to the existing knockback.  What this means is if I am hit to the right of the stage, and I input up, I'll still get knocked back pretty far, but slightly upwards.  Conversely, if I DI directly left, towards the stage, it reduces the knockback, keeping me safe.  If you're hit up/down, go left/right.  If you're hit left/right, DI to the stage, with some minor up/down adjustments."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,mayonnnnaise,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this explanation, as I have been playing since release day of 64, but stopped playing for a long time after brawl and forgot how to DI. and I hadn't figured it out again on sm4sh yet."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,SuperSpicyBasil,2,Fri Jul 3 10:46:12 2015 UTC,With edge game one of the most welcome editions is you can just walk of edge.  For example Mario can intercept an enemy below ground level with a f-air and still have room to recover.
sm4sh,3bxx1r,unchartedcubes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, air dodging no longer puts you into a free falling mode. As long as you don't air dodge lag into the ground, you can do anything after air dodging. Also, you can no long air dodge in a specific direction. You can change your falling momentum left or right during the air dodge, but it's not super noticeable. This leads to aid dodging being MUCH more affective in this game opposed to melee, so use it, but don't get to predictable because people can really punish a read air dodge. (i.e As a falcon main myself, if I read an air dodge near the edge, I can kill someone at 60-70% off the side which is a really early kill in Sm4sh.  If you are smashed right, hold left. If you're smashed up, hold down. Ect. The only time you DI away is to stop being comboed, obviously. Don't DI in if you're getting Sheik faired. There are more complicated DI to stop some true combos on people like Diddy and Sheik, but I'm not sure how in-depth you want to go in your research. Probably don't need to at this point in time. For now, just DI out when you know you won't die from a hit.  This is a great video that explains the misconception about Sm4sh DI, along with how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnqgfP7vrTs  You can ledge trump by ""Stealing"" the ledge and you can act appropriately. You only get invincibility from the first time you grab the edge, so if you trump and they attempt to go back to the ledge you can get an easy stage spike.   Edit: /u/SuperSpicyBasil, also made a good point. Some recoveries have a little hit box on certain frames that put them above the ledge that can be hit with some moves, but that's only some."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,unchartedcubes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:52:18 2015 UTC,"Also, I can help you with anything on Yoshi, Captain Falcon, Diddy Kong, and Ryu. (Ryu obviously less than the others. He's new and really complicated)"
sm4sh,3bxx1r,DoctorProfPatrick,3,Fri Jul 3 05:56:40 2015 UTC,"This ended up being longer than I wanted.  tl;dr, falcon is a good choice to learn the game even though his ground game will feel clunky.  SHFFLing is bad, blockstun is gone, hitstun is much lower, and buffering is a thing and you should take advantage of it to be frame perfect on almost everything.  Just something to add, treat everyone like they have melee Luigi's nair.  If you go in too hard, people will just hit you away because of the low hitstun.  So just like with melee Luigi you want to bait the ""nair"", beat the ""nair"", or space in such a way that ""nair"" can't connect.  You also have to bait and/or beat out airdodge since it's so non-committal now (you don't go into free fall).   This makes the game less about combos and more about stage control and positioning.  When you go for an attack, make sure that it's not a huge commitment otherwise the opponent could easily turn the tide on you.  As far as characters, no one is going to feel great to you.  Not because of wave dashing, dash dancing, l-cancelling, or even your inability to combo.  The things I think about when switching games are SHFFLing, blockstun, and buffering.  I'll use falcon as an example since I'll likely recommend him to you.   SHFFL: it's completely gone.  You now have to autocancel your aerials (SHAC?), but not every aerial can be auto canceled and almost none can be FF into auto cancel.  Falcon has a strict window to autocancel nair and upair, but bair will easily autocancel out of short hop, and IIRC you can bair another falcon and still autocancel it.  Blockstun: Also basically removed in this game.  There is almost no safe shield pressure in the game (Falcon's upair is safe in something like a 2 frame window supposedly).  If someone hits your shield and doesn't cross you up, you can almost certainly shield grab or Upsmash OoS (sidenote: upsmash OoS works the same way as melee).  It still takes 7 frames to drop shield tho, so don't expect tilts OoS to work too well.  Buffering:  This is big!!  Buffering isn't often talking about, but abusing the buffer is necessary to play at a high-top level.  It's hard to tell with smash4, but brawl had a 10 frame buffer which allows you to ""buffer"" a move, so that it comes out on the first available frame.  For example: let's say I'm a Luigi and I want to do Luigi's patented d-throw double fair.  During the down-throw, I input jump while Luigi is standing up from slamming his ass down during the down throw, then I input fair as he's standing around idly at the end of down throw, then I input the second fair when he's pulled his hand back from the first fair.  In melee, Luigi would've done absolutely nothing until I realized that I mess up, but in Smash 4 I just did a frame perfect d-throw double fair.  I know it sounds stupid, but there's no reason not to take advantage of it.  Buffering the first fair isn't always a good idea, but this is just an example."
sm4sh,3bxx1r,DoctorProfPatrick,2,Fri Jul 3 07:05:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was seriously amazing. As far as buffering goes, should I be trying to do it with everything? If I play purely on reaction or what I think would be frame-perfect in melee will I just be playing slow and not getting the follow-ups I need?"
sm4sh,3bxx1r,the_real_waldo_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:03:16 2015 UTC,"You'll probably do fine even if you totally ignore the concept, but if you actually plan on getting good you should try to work it in.  Either way you'll feel slow and annoyed by the lack of follow ups :p  At first, try buffering out of roll or spotdodge.  As Falcon, spotdodge into jab is a solid tool that most people can't punish on reaction.  You should also buffer almost all of your SHAC, especially nair (as Falcon).  Other than that, you won't really notice an extra frame or two, so it's not worth the headache until you start to do it more subconsciously."

sm4sh,3bt0hv,CanoeShoes,8,Thu Jul 2 01:37:05 2015 UTC,As someone who plays Roy I'd say wait for either side b (be ready for that multi hit down variation) or the short hop nair. Shield through those and punish however you can. Roy is a character that you have to play aggressively with to be effective (that could just be my play style) so just be patient and wait for a wiff or one of his many laggy moves. For me if you can shut down my approach with nair or fair then it ruins my day. Anyway hope that helps!

sm4sh,3bt0hv,CanoeShoes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:36:30 2015 UTC,It helps to use a character with more aerial range. Then just space him properly. if he's only hitting you with sour spots you are going to be around for a while.

sm4sh,3bpm47,MrTriHorse,4,Wed Jul 1 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"I can't kill him off stage because he recovers with him really well and makes it almost impossible to kill him.   Once you launch him off of the stage, because of his shitty aerials it is much easier to combo off-stage, and you can just wall him out so he can't get back to the stage no matter what. Get him horizontally away from the stage, that is when he is the most helpless. This obviously works best with characters with more than two jumps, Jigglypuff being the best for this situation imo."

sm4sh,3bpm47,vinspants,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:16:10 2015 UTC,Yo! All those characters have projectiles.  Force an approach with them OR shoot them out while your bro is offstage for a quick and safe kill.

sm4sh,3bpm47,maulice,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:56:01 2015 UTC,"I saw in a comment reply that you main pikachu. (I also main pika)  If you have any mains or secondaries with a projectile there is no reason to approach. You have a move that can do damage from a distance and you said yourself that you can't approach this guy.....why are you even trying?  Use tjolt from a distance until he comes to you.    Also, from how you worded your post, it sounds like you have your brother conditioned to wait for you to approach.  It sounds to me like you will approach no matter what if he waits long enough.  So again I have to ask.....why aren't you using tjolt to pressure him until he approaches?  I promise you he won't be patient enough for you to tjolt him to kill percents.  Without a projectile of his own the burden of approach is always on him."
sm4sh,3bpm47,MrBoobieBuyer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"I guess Thunder Jolting him repeatedly to get him to approach is smart, I usually am accustomed to approaching him when he uses Little Mac because he is pretty darn patient and could wait there for quite a while. At some point I end up getting impatient and then go at him which results in me not being able to find any openings when he uses his jab and other really good shield poking moves."

sm4sh,3b9dx9,discforhire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:38:19 2015 UTC,The best way for you to improve is to play with the best and go out to as many tournaments as possible. Almost every player in the top 30 in the state attends the E2C monthlies.
sm4sh,3b9dx9,discforhire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:08:04 2015 UTC,Does the tournament start with pools? And how much is it to get in?
sm4sh,3b0gq0,Mafumofu,8,Wed Jun 24 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"The current state if competive play, like if one character starts doing well and becomes prominent in the meta"
sm4sh,3b0gq0,gnarwallman,2,Wed Jun 24 23:53:59 2015 UTC,That helps. Thank you!
sm4sh,3b0gq0,Amazing_Kong,4,Thu Jun 25 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"In addition to this, often people will refer to a single character's meta.  This refers to how that character is used in competitive play."
sm4sh,3b0gq0,TheGreatTrogs,4,Thu Jun 25 00:30:46 2015 UTC,"The term ""meta"" refers to a level of abstraction encompassing something.  The term ""meta-data"" refers to data describing a piece of data, such as the data size, location, and format.  In the same way, ""meta-game"" refers to ""game"" surrounding a game.  Where the game of SSB is figuring out how to fight against characters with your own character, the meta-game would be deciding which character is best at fighting against another character."
sm4sh,3b0gq0,Mitchiro,9,Thu Jun 25 13:55:08 2015 UTC,"Not only pertaining to this game, but the ""meta"" refers to a level of play beyond the casual, usually when it comes to competitive play.  In Smash for instance, when you play in a party setting, it's usually free for all, items on, chaos everywhere. The competitive scene usually plays one on one with no items, so in order to beat your opponent, you need to deeply understand all mechanics of the game, any advanced techniques that are discovered, your character inside and out, as well as your opponent's characters the same.  To use Pokemon as another example, a casual battle would probably include you using your favorite and most leveled Pokemon, maybe thinking about type to cover some weaknesses. The meta involves selectively catching and breeding Pokemon with certain abilities/Natures in order to maximize the stats they excel in, and building a team with defined roles in order to cover weaknesses most efficiently. Again, the big thing is knowing the ins and outs of the game mechanics and using them to their full potential."
sm4sh,3b0gq0,Mitchiro,2,Thu Jun 25 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"It seems difficult to get that in depth level of understanding for each character in this game, there being so many of them. I main Charizard and Falco and know the ins and outs very well, but with other characters I'm a little lost. Would the best way to learn the specifics be to play other characters a lot?"
sm4sh,3b0gq0,bluedanes,5,Thu Jun 25 07:55:07 2015 UTC,"Play with them, and be sure to play against them as well. I think one thing that makes it easier is to fully understand the mechanics in the game, and know which moves you need to watch out for on each character. Once you have that deep level of understanding, the game becomes all about trying to figure out what you're opponent is going to (or bait them into doing certain things) and counter accordingly without leaving yourself open for the same."
sm4sh,3b0gq0,SuperSpicyBasil,3,Thu Jun 25 12:13:36 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in getting better on a competitive level, try and find out if there is a local smash scene by you. Attending offline tournaments is really great for improving yourself, especially because you will most likely be able to play against people better than you, and help gain matchup experience."
sm4sh,3axq2f,Guardianangel93,4,Wed Jun 24 10:01:41 2015 UTC,I personally think you use way too many smash attacks and aerials.  You're really easy to read.  You should be using utilt and dtilt to combo more.
sm4sh,3axq2f,Phnglui,5,Wed Jun 24 13:00:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, Ryu's tilts all around are fantastic.    Work on finding tilts that combo into smash attacks.  For example Utilt combos into itself about 3 times and then into Shoryuken.  I know there are others that people have found and probably some that people haven't figured out yet.    Lastly, imo, the thing that makes you easy to read is that you always went for the aggressive option.  I think you did a good job mixing up your attacks but when you are always coming in with an attack it doesn't really matter if you mix up the attacks themselves.  You will always get beaten by shield grab in those scenarios. If you added some empty hops and tomahawks to your gameplay I think that would really step your Ryu up a notch or two."
sm4sh,3axq2f,firebert6,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, but approaching with Ryu on the ground isn´t always easy. His dash attack isn´t really safe and his grab range is almost non existant in a dash. Will try some new things tho :)"
sm4sh,3axq2f,Phnglui,4,Wed Jun 24 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"Why approach all the time?  Unless you're playing against a ranged spammer, your hadouken means that you can force them to approach.  Go in slow and use hadouken until you're in range, and then you can come in with your tilts or jabs (don't forget that there's a difference between a tap and hold on all of your moves).  Coming in with a nair isn't a bad idea but you need to switch it up with other moves sometimes, since you get predictable fast.    Over reliance on smash attacks is bad because once your opponent realizes you use them often, they can just run up and shield your smash attacks, then punish you every time.  Your bread and butter combos are going to be utilt -> utilt -> shoryuken and dtilt -> dtilt -> hadouken.  Your utilt and dtilt both cancel into other moves."
sm4sh,3axq2f,Phnglui,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:23:01 2015 UTC,"Thats just my playstyle, to approach all the time. I don´t want to sit and wait for my opponent to come to me. Looking at pro fights, thats what they are doing too. They both go at each other all the time.  Okay, so less Smash attacks and more mixups ^"
sm4sh,3asx6w,menkoy,15,Tue Jun 23 06:35:08 2015 UTC,The timing on Shulk's counter gets stricter the more it's used.

sm4sh,3asx6w,ambi94,10,Tue Jun 23 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, the normal gets stricter, too. Power Vision makes it even more strict the more you use it in exchange for power."

sm4sh,3asx6w,ambi94,3,Tue Jun 23 20:03:43 2015 UTC,Could it have something to do with the explosion that occurs just after the initial impact?
sm4sh,3asx6w,Cubelord,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:56:22 2015 UTC,I think it does because unless you time it perfectly on Ike's or Marth's counter they get slammed too.
