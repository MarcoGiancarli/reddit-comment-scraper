valve,3dtk5e,ReiBob,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:43:48 2015 UTC,"Iirc, they never actually did quit the idea, they just worded it a certain way.  EDIT: guess not. I think I was thinking of this quote atm of my post from valve's statement:    We think this made us miss the mark pretty badly, even though we believe there's a useful feature somewhere here.    which to note they say ""even though we believe there IS a useful feature somewhere here"", not that there WAS. This sentence was phrased in present tense as far as paid mods go. Also remember reading a remark on a reddit comment somewhere with something similar.   Thank you though /u/DrakenZA for the correction."

Bethesda should be commissioning the most talented modders to make mods for their games, not making the community pay the modders.

valve,3dtk5e,DrakenZA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"Bethesda has never released 'good' free DLC ever. Good 'free' DLC is very rare these days, unless its getting funded some other way.  The content creators are going to make the content regardless of Bethesda paying them or not, hence Bethesda will just not do it.  The Paid mod system is great, not sure why so many people hated it. I can understand why it was a huge disaster trying to bring it out on a game out for years already, but the idea is fine.  And most of the mod creators liked it, else they wouldn't of put a price on their mods, it was optional you do know that right ?  You had a few creators here and there complaining but that was mostly due to the fact that they were using pieces of other peoples mods and they would have huge problems selling their mod, it wasnt because they didnt want money."
valve,3dtk5e,Firepower01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"I've played plenty of games with good free DLC. One of my favorite game series of all time had nothing but free DLC (Wargame series), Payday 2 which is a VERY popular game also has plenty good free DLC, same with Killing Floor. I really could go on and on. However you're making the mistake of equating amateur mods to professionally supported DLC. Mods are amateur content, they are not supported by the developers.  You never even addressed my main point. Bethesda is essentially scheming to find a way to get content added to their game that they don't have to pay for and can still make a profit off it. I'm fine with adding an option on the Steam workshop to allow people to donate to modders but that's it."

valve,3drtv4,ceco777,9,Sat Jul 18 21:10:19 2015 UTC,my understanding is that the refund system isn't meant to be for games that you don't like but is intended to protect you if games don't run hence the 2 hour limit. Unfortunately I don't think you have any way of rectifying this. If you are running on a tight budget I would suggest limiting yourself to games with demos?
valve,3drtv4,blacktags,3,Sat Jul 18 21:53:33 2015 UTC,That 2 hours is not demo. It is game developers decission if they make demos or not. Valve just makes sure if you cant run game or something like that so you didnt buy it for nothing
valve,3drtv4,nunnukkamies,3,Sat Jul 18 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly you can try it anyway, they have a box for your comments to just explain why it is you dont want the game. IIRC they say somewheres on the refund policy or the last announcement on the policy changes that the 2 hours isn't a make or break thing. However I can't vouch for this personally since all of my refunds have been played for less than 2 hours."
valve,3drtv4,Smooth_Trumpeteer,3,Sun Jul 19 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"Is there anyway to get refunded/ bypass this restriction?   Best you can do is write a support ticket. But, no, probably not. The 2 hour mark is for ""Does this game actually run on my PC?"" not ""I don't know if I'll like this game or not."" If you want a demo of a game, talk to the publisher/developer. Refunds are not demos."
valve,3drtv4,mishugashu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:50:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, no way to bypass this. 2 hours of gameplay is actually OK as more would lead to an abuse of refunding system."

valve,3d733q,muhammadbimo1,5,Tue Jul 14 01:03:53 2015 UTC,I think it's for VR support
valve,3d733q,Sky_Hawk105,2,Tue Jul 14 01:38:52 2015 UTC,It's a Steam VR update. You can go to your tools in your Steam library and download Steam VR separately so Steam VR updates show as Steam VR updates and not updates for other games.
valve,3d733q,CommodoreBluth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:02:34 2015 UTC,"According to Steamdb, the update focused upon the Virtual Reality as stated by /u/Sky_Hawk105. All of the packages focased around VR and making it work for different OS.  You can find the update log here"

valve,3cyvsd,Fan7a_Orange,6,Sun Jul 12 01:23:20 2015 UTC,0.3 hrs on record last played on 21 May   No other games played. It's obvious a throwaway account and probably will never be active again. I don't know what you guys expect to happen with a ban.
valve,3cyvsd,not_from_this_world,4,Sun Jul 12 12:43:52 2015 UTC,Probably because he didn't play enough for the cheat to be detected.
valve,3cyvsd,lithiumbb,5,Sun Jul 12 12:56:51 2015 UTC,"It's hardly revolutionary, nor is it particularly effective. Anti-cheats are very hard to maintain, as cheat developers generally have the upper hand. Valve has to keep updating VAC with cheat signatures which can only happen if they get their hands on the cheat, which is not easy for most private cheats. Then they have to reverse engineer it in order to be able to detect it with VAC. And then once it's been detected, the cheat provider can usually easily update it to be undetected once again."
valve,3cyvsd,lithiumbb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, a friend of mine has his own private custom bots for both wow and d3. several banwaves passed, not a scratch on his account."
valve,3cyvsd,ciny,5,Sun Jul 12 15:57:36 2015 UTC,"It likely can do that as well, but most cheats don't rely on modifying the game files as that's a particularly easy way to get caught."

valve,3cyp80,Roulbs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"He was cheating.  Vac bans aren't like Overwatch bans. vacs are pretty much 100% cheating while ow bans are ""probably"" cheating. (theres been a shitton of people that have been overwatch banned and had that reversed while vac bans are hardly ever removed)  Valve also doesn't send you emails telling you you were banned. - he lied about that  Valve also doesnt send you emails tellying yo you were banned because someone else played on your acct.  You can get vac banned from having someone else play on your account tho if that person cheats and logged into your account and the cheat is detected your account will get banned. So that could have been what happened, but seeing how he lied about receiving an email, hes probably lying about not cheating too."

valve,3cm6ol,Xtorting,2,Thu Jul 9 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"The difference, in my opinion, is that you have some actual links and ""evidence"" to support your Google theories, but finding legitimate HL3 evidence is like catching smoke with a net."
valve,3cm6ol,iwasazombie,3,Thu Jul 9 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"There may not be evidence, but it's logical. There's no way that HL3 hasn't been in development, at least passively, this whole time. It's Valve's flagship franchise.  The trouble is that Valve knows they have to make a game that will live up to the reputation and experience of the previous two Half Life games. Not just make a game - but purposefully engineer a legendary experience. They're taking their time, not revealing anything so that they no cynicism can build (AKA, Starwars Battlefront, curse of the whiny self-entitled neckbeards). I think that's been their strategy for years. I believe that's why Valve has been investing so much in the hardware side of things - specifically VR.   They're going for a totally immersive Half-Life (or Orange Box II), and I bet we're going to see some hints after VR picks up. I don't think that valve will market HL3 as a launch Vive launch title because A; it's probably not ready, and B; they don't want people to think that it's exclusive to VR, or that VR is a gimmick developed just for HL3. But I think we're legitimately closer to HL3 announcement than we've ever been.  In addition, rather than focusing on more impressive graphics, Source 2 seems to have a huge emphasis on optimization, so a massive range of people on Windows,  Mac, and Linux will be able to experience their blockbuster games - and... everyone will be able to use their VR.  And even if it's not HL3, I'm 100% certain that Valve has been developing at least one story-driven title since Portal 2 that will be announced relatively soon. Perhaps L4D 3 or Portal 3 or a new IP. It's not like they have everyone working on Dota 2, TF2, Steam, Vive, and Source 2. Like, what have their artists been doing this whole time? Making hats? No, they've essentially handed that over to the community at this point.  Very soon, Valve is gonna come back in a huge way wreck the competition."
valve,3cm6ol,JackHemming,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Man, I hope you're right. The most likely next release (besides full Dota 2 Reborn on Source 2) is probably L4D3."

valve,3cm6ol,Magroo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:47 2015 UTC,"Absence of news does not necessarily mean absence of caring. Absence of news does not necessarily mean absence of passion.   I get it, you know? Valve is a big company. They make a ridiculous amount of money for an independent game development studio. Their customer service is abysmal. There's been no big game news for years. If they intend on making a Half-Life 3, WHY HAVEN'T THEY SAID SOMETHING?  What are you passionate about? That's kind of a rhetorical question, but really think about it. If you could do what you're passionate about for the rest of your life, and be paid well for it, would you do it?  Valve hires people who are really fucking passionate about making great games. Half-Life 2 is one of the most praised games of all time. Half-Life 3 is arguably the most HYPED game of all time - and it hasn't even been announced yet.   The folks at Valve are passionate about living up to their reputation. Valve is going to take it's time making Half-Life 3. Read their ""Work at Valve"" page. Read their employee handbook. Passion is splattered all over it.  ""The thing is they don't have to come back they are winning at making money""  George R.R. Martin doesn't HAVE to finish ASOIAF, because he's winning at making money.  George Lucas didn't have to make the Star Wars Prequels (Regardless of whether or not they're shit!!!!!!) because he was winning at making money.  Re-Logic doesn't have to keep updating Terraria with insane amounts of new content, because they're winning at making money.  I don't have to finish this argument, because I'm winning at writing arguments.  Nobody is forced to do anything if they're winning.  But they still do, over, and over, and over again.  If people are passionate, they will keep DOING WHAT THEY ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT. And if they are smart, they will use the money they make off of their maintainable projects (I:E, Hats, Star Wars Royalties) to fund their passion projects.  If they're lazy, then yes, they will just cash in forever. But VALVE ISN'T LAZY.    Here's the deal, it's all in the eye of the beholder. People either choose to assume that Valve is not making Half-Life 3 because there's little evidence to the contrary... or they can choose to assume that Valve is making Half-Life 3 because there's LITTLE EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.

valve,3cm6ol,Magroo,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"Like some of my theories though, simply connecting the dots is easier than you might imagine. Something like a Steam machine bundled with HL3 for free would be amazing exposure for both products.   Remember the Google barge off of the SF coast, or the floating showroom sailboat? My guess is that it was going to be used to sell Project ARA modules, Google Glasses, Nexus devices, and Project Fi contracts. Basically a floating storefront for everything Google. But then the mean, old, outdated government had to step in and call it a fire hazard.   Not that hard to speculate on future services once you find the pattern in their products, no matter who the company is."

How kicking works The kicking function on CSGO is supposed to be used to kick disruptive people (obviously not the case for this scenario) So by design, anyone who is kicked, cannot re-join that server for 30 minutes    How the missions work Your mission is to get a certain objective on the map de_season So whenever you matchmake for your mission it looks for a server running Season    Your situation It is most likely the case that no servers (apart from the one you have been kicked from) are running season in the gametype you need. You will have to wait untill either - A server changes map to Season - The current server you are kicked from stops hosting season (and therefore the matchmaking system makes you a new Season server if none are available) - Your Kicking cooldown expires for that server, and you can rejoin if the map is still season.    Its pretty unfortunate that you were kicked when completing a mission. but you would have to dedicate the fuck you to the players, not the matchmaking algorithims for joining games. You wouldnt want someone who is hacking to be able to keep joining your games.

Valve seem to have no interest addressing the community's concerns in any effective way and simple mechanisms to stop player abuse are not implemented for reasons that seem to boil down to.. they just couldn't be fucked. This is my leasure time, my hobby, the thing that I turn towards to unwind and lately this game winds me up more than real life, how fucked up is that? In recent months I have had to mute more people than ever because of mic abuse, general shit talking, constant derogatory attacks by multiple users, rarely on me but like fuck I want to hear that shit. There are so many underage children on this game I'm thinking about making a formal complaint of some kind to a watchdog or some such shit. Exposing children to gambling mechanisms at the very least should set alarm bells off with some people. Valve doesn't seem to give a single fuck about 9yos exposed to this environment. Beyond that I don't want to be exposed to them either.  The community has clearly gone to shit and Valve and steam are clearly incapable of managing the situation or perhaps rather they don't want to spend the money to develop safeguards to prevent the kind of abuse that is commonplace.  It's not acceptable that the community continually has to make demands for things that are common sense to any one with half a brain.  Valve had great public perception as a game developer at one point but rather than build upon that they rode it out and did the bare minimum for years and it's about time people start calling them on it.

valve,3c3do5,phipb,2,Sat Jul 4 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"But they did. They did develop it. Team Ico is a part of Sony's game development studios..    Team Ico (stylized as Team ICO) is a Japanese video game development team led by game designer Fumito Ueda. It is part of SCE Japan Studio's Product Development Department #1.   It is owned and operated by Sony. Their offices are in Sony's main office building in Tokyo. So yes, Sony is developing the Last Guardian."
valve,3c3do5,AuthorAlden,0,Sun Jul 5 00:33:34 2015 UTC,Are Valve a major games publisher? You seem to have missed the point. Sony doesn't have direct involvement in developing tlg I'm pretty sure.
valve,3c3do5,phipb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:45:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't missed any point. The OP image is silly fanboy nonsense, and I don't agree with it any more than you do. So you don't need to move the goalposts with your comment about Valve being a publisher. My only argument was that you're mistaken about The Last Guardian. It is developed by Sony. It's a first party game.   Sony doesn't have direct involvement in developing tlg I'm pretty sure.   I really don't understand your insistence with this. How do you figure they don't have direct involvement when Sony is literally developing the game? The people making the game are Sony employees. It's being developed in the main Sony office building. In what way is this not Sony having direct involvement?  Are you just confused because of the ""Team ICO"" brand? As I've said, it's a division of SCE Japan Studio. It's just a name. In fact, at no time in its history was Team ICO ever an independent studio. So it's not even like it was an acquisition, like Naughty Dog or Media Molecule were. It was founded by Sony as an internal team. The same is true of other Sony teams like Polyphony Digital or Santa Monica Studio."
valve,3c3do5,AuthorAlden,0,Sun Jul 5 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Not insisting on anything. That's why I said ""I'm pretty sure"" you know.  What I mean is that Valve as a company in general I'm pretty sure but not 100% sure has way more involvement in the development and stuff. I don't really know all that much about Sony and team ico but I at least thought that team ico as in the development team is a bit more independent."
valve,3c3do5,phipb,12,Sun Jul 5 21:05:55 2015 UTC,"Man, it's almost as if valve wants to wait for their massive releases until after they make their first engine in fifteen fucking years so their long awaited game isn't outdated the moment it's released!

They also express that a static linear single-player experience is no longer a modern idea as it used to be--but rather that the freemium profit model and games that continually generate playability are the forward-thinking ideas. Open world seems to me to be the most fluid application of these ideas to the Half Life universe, as it would allow the game to expand in a way that is consistent with Half Life's seamless environments."

valve,3bgs9q,stefanocorona12,3,Mon Jun 29 03:25:49 2015 UTC,Black Mesa devs asked to get it on Steam first. That is completly different than putting something on greenlight one day.
valve,3bgs9q,qu3L,6,Mon Jun 29 09:58:31 2015 UTC,"Nope. Black Mesa is by Crowbar Collective. Its too bad they don't want to share some assets, its probably a legal thing."

valve,3bcuoi,FinsternIRL,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"very true. The Vive also requires a lot of gpu power, you probably won't be able to use it if  you don't have a recent high end graphics card."
valve,3bcuoi,sharkwouter,3,Sun Jun 28 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"Hardware specs say 1080p at 60fps[1], which is less than throughput needed for 90 fps at slightly higher than 1080p res that Vive runs at, so basically to echo FinsternIRL, it'd be a nauseating and juttery, even if it magically wasn't high latency.

valve,3aqtuz,DaGuyWithDaShadow,3,Mon Jun 22 19:45:11 2015 UTC,I traded a steam community summer sale card that I got after buying the game. It's related to the minigame that's up on the store page.
valve,3aqtuz,flashmozzg,7,Mon Jun 22 19:49:59 2015 UTC,Title is badly worded. Makes you think you traded card for a game.
valve,3amgzs,speckz,2,Sun Jun 21 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"Great article, however my only concern is how accurate the 32,000 copies sold on average is. With Valve basically opening up steam and allowing all sorts of garbage onto the store I believe some of this may have skewed the statistics."
valve,3amgzs,thanksm8s,4,Sun Jun 21 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I think that's the point.  Back in the days, it was so hard to get on Steam, the few games that did got a lot of attention, and getting on Steam was almost synonymous with being successful.  I guess it's hard to guess if it was more ""got on Steam because game was popular"" or ""Was popular because it got on Steam"", but nonetheless, a game on Steam was known to make a lot of money.  This isn't true anymore though, now that the games have opened and that there's a flood of new games, sales don't come for free anymore, and that's what the 32000 figure is showing here. You actually have to work for it, even if you managed to get on Steam."

valve,3amgzs,Ph0X,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:52:09 2015 UTC,I was more referring to the having to work for it part. Bad Rats just was bad. It sells because they didn't work for it.

valve,3ahj4x,Miles360x,9,Sat Jun 20 06:22:02 2015 UTC,"Very random videos with no use, disabling of the comments, poor editing, random clips of useless stuff like his GF eating something at the end of one of his videos, posting videos constantly about his stream asking for funding (then at time removing the videos)  It doesn't seem well organized anymore and it's becoming just his vlog where he talks about Valve related content and his own crap. In the beginning it was straight valve content scripted, orginized, and simple editing that was enough. Now it's just this mess  EDIT: Oh you're Tyler aren't you? My bad but my opinion still stands. Don't take offense it's just how I've felt, been watching your videos for a long time now"

Like, it went down?  The Stream for funding was a one time thing and is now over, and I do post Stream announcement videos, which get taken down right after the stream ends.  The Ironic thing is, the old videos were not scripted where as the ones I put out now are. So I don't know what to tell you there.  Could you explain how the videos have become disorganized?"
valve,3ahj4x,Waffliez,2,Sat Jun 20 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"It's just how I feel as I've edited the original message I didn't know you were Tyler. Don't take offense, I am on my phone and don't have the time to document every single change that I've notice. Scripted was a poor word, can't think of the proper word atm.

valve,3a9i9l,iwasazombie,9,Thu Jun 18 17:14:13 2015 UTC,"One of the main reasons I prefer VNN to ValveTime is because the narrator from VT seems to want to send me to sleep rather than educate me on current goings-on.

valve,3a9i9l,Elephant454,5,Thu Jun 18 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"eh what? http://www.dota2.com/reborn/part3  says source 2 right there. dota 2 reborn uses the source 2 engine, not source 1. you dont need tools to have the engine released. that being said its not like dota2 is making much use of the source 2 renderer, and im not even sure how much of the source 2 renderer is in source 2. the engine is more than just visuals, its everything that makes the game, and chances are we wont see a lot of the new renderer until a more substantial update or a brand new game using source 2 comes out."
valve,3a9i9l,Japface,3,Thu Jun 18 22:24:06 2015 UTC,He's saying that source 2 is not released until you can make a game independent of dota 2.
valve,3a9i9l,holben,2,Thu Jun 18 23:41:50 2015 UTC,I guess. I mean I'd say the engine has been release under dota2 for consumption. You just can't make anything yet on it but it's certainly been release in that form.

valve,3a5ohg,Zombrah,10,Wed Jun 17 13:22:39 2015 UTC,Well here's the problem: having your hopes up for Valve to come out when the list of devs did not have Valve listed.
valve,3a5ohg,AlvorWarBear,3,Wed Jun 17 14:21:34 2015 UTC,I was surprised people expected valve to be there. When is the last time they did anything at e3 anyway? I don't remember.

valve,3a5ohg,bluebird2912,7,Wed Jun 17 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I really wish people would get over Valve. It seems pretty obvious the direction they seem to be going in and that making games has dropped down the list of priorities. They have a very loose structure that has bred innovation for a long time and I imagine the last decade or so has seen the scope and budget for new projects increase massively. It's not shocking to see them move away from making games and towards more ambitious products (like VR, like SteamOS, like Steam Machines etc).    Although I'm sure we'll see more games from Valve in the future there's no point sitting around getting angry or writing letters (honestly I can't believe you think Valve needs reminding of the enormous amount of fans  they currently have. They're more than aware of the immense scrutiny and pressure everything they do is under). Just let them be and eventually they'll announce something. Until then move on, it's the only way to win."

If he was exaggerating and Valve did say ""no"", then it might be even more confusing.  They've got Steam Controllers, Steam Link, Steam Machines, Steam OS, Steam VR (Vive specifically), they could make more people aware they now offer refunds, they could plug Source 2 and how it's completely free as long as your game is on Steam, they could plug Lighthouse being free and what it's capable of and what partners they have, they could share data for developers about why Steam is a platform worth investing in... nope, none of that."

valve,3a4edm,baptisto,13,Wed Jun 17 10:09:00 2015 UTC,yea. dota 2 and csgo arent real games.   only 4 hour long singleplayer games with yearly sequels count as REAL GAMES.

valve,3a4edm,sajdx1,33,Thu Jun 18 08:01:27 2015 UTC,"I think valve has this idea that the best way to stay out of controversy and potential hate is to make as few public statements as possible. Fly under the radar. Then, when the time is right, announce to the world what you've been doing all this time. I can respect that approach.  Here's the problem, though. There's a difference between flying under the radar and not being on the map at all. Valve is extremely detached from the gaming community to an annoying extent.  I think valve needs to focus on embracing the gaming community, even if they're not going to say much."

This is the official first look at source 2. And the fact that there is custom games means that you won't have to like dota 2 to have fun with dota 2. It means you can hop onto dota 2 and play some sort of Starcraft style game instead. Community made custom games is what made dota, it's what made team fortress and it is what made counterstrike.  Source 2 is a huge deal and sometime in the next 7 days they are gonna show it off with the help from the dota update."

valve,3a4edm,Stikanator,15,Wed Jun 17 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter because they make boatloads of money every day, but their silence has damaged their brand in my eyes. I understand if they aren't making HL3 (it's really a problematic game to produce), but their total silence on various things for the past few years makes them seem like they just don't give a shit. Although they repaired this slightly with their new refund policy, that has been their growing image with the paid mods fiasco and general lack of quality control on steam.  I'm just comparing the experience of this e3 against other companies who clearly care about their fans - I mean Bethesda made it rain this E3, as did Sony and other companies. Right now, Valve seems to be that like that era when Maxis morphed into EA."
valve,3a4edm,lifeincolor,10,Wed Jun 17 04:18:23 2015 UTC,"Valve is structured in a way that makes it seem like they don't give a shit.  Over the years, I've learned that you cannot expect anything from Valve. Not like other game devs or publishers.They don't exactly conform to industry standards, and that makes them incredibly difficult to follow.  Valve is a unique beast, and I have different expectations for them. It's natural for Valve to be tight-lipped - things are chopped and changed so much internally that I won't be surprised if there have already been several iterations of HL2 : E3/ HL3 already axed.  Valve doesn't drop bombs anually, or even consistently at all. They are more of a slow burn. So take a seat, and enjoy Valve Time™."

valve,3a4edm,sabasNL,3,Wed Jun 17 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"Since their inception, Valve's methods haven't really changed much I think, and their brand has only grown since then.   I'm not saying Valve's method is absolutely flawless, they do cock it up with their implementation sometimes (Steam early days, recently with paid mods, customer support), but they usually deliver, even if done at a glacial pace.  If they have to leave their fans in the dark about their projects, I'm fine with that, personally.   However, more transparency in some areas (Steam especially) does not hurt, but sadly I don't see Valve ever changing that."
valve,3a4edm,egilskal,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"I really hope Valve doesn't turn into Maxis, but I'm afraid I am seeing similarities.     Both somewhat indie, cool companies to work at, producing hit after hit. Then Maxis's previous laid-back development model backfired when the team became chaotic after SimCity 4, in addition to greedy pressure from EA (who by now had become the studio heads directly), leading to the abominations of Spore and SimCity Societies. Although I'm speculating here, it is probable that Will Wright left the studio because it had become an empty shell of what it was first.    The Sims 2 and 3 aren't bad games, even though they have a lot of greedy DLC options, but the rest were really sub-par.     Especially sad when you think of Spore as Wright's dream project, it was supposed to be the ultimate simulator. Great ideas were scrapped due to a troubled development, gameplay was dumbed down and made childish due to pressure from EA, promised DLC and expansions never came because the funding was cut. More than 2 decades Wright dreamed about Spore, but the great game he showed in 2005 was not the game released to the public at all.     Now, Valve is still not in that situation, but I really hope Half-Life 3 doesn't become like Spore."
valve,3a4edm,sabasNL,-7,Wed Jun 17 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"So true, Valve needs to do something really quick because this isn't going the right way. Soon other gaming platforms will emerge and Valve will lose market share.   This week must have been a disaster for them, they saw other controllers, you know that thing where Valve has been working on for yeaaaars. They see other game engines like Unreal Engine 4 that has been growing and growing. And so they are working with Microsoft right now. Valve and Microsoft.. that's like Penny and Sheldon having a relationship. It's true. They saw the implementation of new VR that is a far better concept then what they build 'secretly'.

Valve doesn't have to micromanage what third-party manufacturers are doing.  P.S. Saying ""their platform will wither on the vine"" is silly. Their ""platform"" is Steam.

valve,3a0at0,P373R1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:56:18 2015 UTC,"I kind of think it would be cool if Omni Party became a spin off game.  Imagine how silly it would be for valve to publish a Mario Party clone, maybe even include other valve characters."
valve,39zi9u,N64CUBE,9,Tue Jun 16 01:25:53 2015 UTC,"I had this conversation with a friend.  I personally thought that E3 would have been the best time to announce HL3, as they recently announced Source2 for Dota2 My friend then mentioned that Valve wasnt on the E3 list and they couldnt possibly be at E3 this year, I retaliated with the fact that if valve was releasing HL3, they could surely arrange something so it private untill the last minute. to be honest, this conversation was super optimistic for me to be having compared to my normal outlooks on releases.  but today, I just re-evaluated the above, and valve are probably not familiar with 100% of source2's capability's OR they haven't fine tuned them all yet. building what is the most awaited game of the century, they want to at least know what their engine is capable of - by developing a few games on the engine first.    Lots of my friends talk about HL1 and 2 as being revolutionary for their time. Which is true, if you go back and play them now, the impact however is lost, as the revolutionary elements of these games have been incorporated into many other games.    HL3 needs to bring something huge and new to the table if Valve want to avoid letting the player base - looking for the next revolution game - be disappointed, which to be honest the chance of minor/major disappointment grows proportionally with the hype.  I feel like a rock solid virtual reality kit bundled with HL3 is one of the few things left under valves belt that can make HL3 the success it deserves."
valve,39zi9u,P373R1,3,Tue Jun 16 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"I, agree, it needs to be big. But oh, please. Not VR."
valve,39zi9u,morganshen,4,Tue Jun 16 01:55:24 2015 UTC,I think you should keep an open mind about VR. Its not like 3D movies where you need to keep your eyes focused where the camera is focused at all times or you get a headache.
valve,39zi9u,jibjibman,2,Tue Jun 16 05:10:28 2015 UTC,"You mean yes VR? Im sorry you must not have tried it, but VR is fucking amazing."
valve,39zi9u,P373R1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, VR dosnt appeal to me in the slightest at all either, but with a release this big, you need something to show off. after all valve is also a hardware developer now."
valve,39zi9u,P373R1,2,Tue Jun 16 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe an options, one that if someone was to opt out of using VR, it would not hinder the experience it the slightest."
valve,39zi9u,tolesto,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:10:10 2015 UTC,Well it would be a pretty poor design to make a game that didnt have the option to not use VR.    it would be 100% optional if you used the VR headset to play the game or not.

valve,39zi9u,jibjibman,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:20:56 2015 UTC,they will be as affordable as a Monitor in a few years I bet.
valve,39zi9u,HennoLV,0,Tue Jun 16 14:47:08 2015 UTC,"They might be, but they'll still require pretty serious GPU to run. I hope HL3 will be out before VR is affordable and hence won't require it"

valve,39zi9u,seruko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, it does, but not at that fast rate. You can get decent monitor for 100€ right now, but I'm sure you won't be able to get VR+powerful enough gpu to run it (2x90fps) for 100€ in a few years (as you originaly stated)."
valve,39zi9u,Aegers86,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:38:45 2015 UTC,"The pattern exists, but as we know from history, Valve are always known to change their minds. They aren't going to release a game that isn't ready just because they used HL2 as a benchmark for the Source engine.   They are clearly now using Dota 2 as their Source 2 benchmark. If you have had fiddled with the new Hammer app for Source 2, it's brilliantly designed for anyone to pick up and create a custom map. You can edit models right inside Hammer as you're editing the terrain. As long as there are dedicated artists to create fbx models then there will be a steady stream of assets for users to add into their games. It also uses lua as its main scripting language so Valve hopes users will get a basic understanding of it (which Valve have already extensive documentation for) and easily create not only Dota 2 custom maps, but eventually entire games from the ground up in Source 2.  Source was focused on the physics engine.   Source 2 is focused on user generated content.  This means that HL3 is completely out of the picture, because today's gamer doesn't want mute protagonists and cutscene driven storylines. They want corridors, brown and bloom action packed first person shooter with a the main character a Chris Pratt-esque face who was in the Navy SEALS for 10 years. Fuck the theoretical physicists, they'll be deep in the dweeby sidekick trope somewhere near the end of the game when they need a deus ex machina because the writers got lost after 3 years of writers block."

You just can't join a game, you get an error. It's been that way since it came out. It has nothing to do with free games.   Third, Valve is probably the gaming company that cares more about costumers (proof: latest CS:GO update was based on many things the community said they want), so its kinda stupid to say they don't give a shit about the community   They care about adding the features the community wants, they don't seem to care if their servers are up or their games work.

All Australian DOTA players, and SEA. I'm not sure why you think that's such a small deal. What a shitty opinion to think not being able to play properly for over a week is no big deal.  The fact is that Valve makes enough money off us to make a department that takes care of this shit for them so they don't have to compromise working on games and updates to communicate.

valve,38pora,sightofsolomon,22,Fri Jun 5 20:01:31 2015 UTC,There is already controller support for CS:Go and the steam controller is made to be able to use pre exisiting layouts. It won't help at all in CS but you can do it.
valve,38pora,Better_MixMaster,9,Fri Jun 5 21:33:40 2015 UTC,"If by ""they made it"" you're referring to controller button layout, you can always change the button bindings either yourself or downloading popular user-made ones."
valve,38pora,SparkyMcSparks_,6,Fri Jun 5 20:05:16 2015 UTC,Its not really meant for competitive multiplayer FPS's but can be used for casual FPS experiences. If you play CSGO casually it might be fun to use.
valve,38pora,strongbadfreak,2,Fri Jun 5 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting to see if anyone masters the Steam Controller to the point they can compete with the best M&K FPS players.  Since the sensitivity of the pads are configurable it's much more versatile than a normal controller with analogue sticks, so it's entirely feasible; it's just a matter of practice and persistence."
valve,38pora,cunningmunki,3,Sat Jun 6 05:57:27 2015 UTC,"maybe not at the highest levels, but good players in lower tiers might adapt to it well. we'll see. I'm itching to see what snapping to a new aiming point feels like on that trackpad, and how different settings will affect it. Especially exciting for me is the possibility of not needing to use the abxy buttons, and keep thumbs on trackpads the whole time, with the extra buttons on shoulder/back. if one is set up like a shift key, it might work."
valve,38pora,KillKennyG,-2,Sat Jun 6 07:32:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is physically possible. Track pads in no way have the same precision as a good optical/laser mouse. People are not just using aim, they are using low sense, very precise accurate movements, that are mapped to your brain as muscle memory."
valve,38pora,strongbadfreak,2,Sat Jun 6 07:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but these arent just normal trackpads remember, they're much more sensitive and can be set to have inertia too."
valve,38pora,cunningmunki,0,Sat Jun 6 08:03:00 2015 UTC,"Precisely my point. It doesn't matter if they are different track pads, they are still track pads."
valve,38pora,strongbadfreak,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:21:00 2015 UTC,That makes no sense. That's like saying all mice are the same.
valve,38pora,cunningmunki,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:34:04 2015 UTC,No it is the difference between tools and their functions. You are comparing apples to oranges. You wouldn't use a hammer to screw. What do you think is better for precision and accuracy? Your thumb or wrist/arm? If you have to move between a large amount of pixels do you think it would be good to use a higher sensitivity vs a lower one? Large surface vs small surface?
valve,38pora,strongbadfreak,2,Sat Jun 6 19:36:29 2015 UTC,"Its just a steeper learning curve, the technology itself doesn't have to be the limiting factor. Better technology can open up more possibilities, and the Steam Controller track pads are like none that have come before. It's at least possible that players could become so adept as to be able to compete with M&K players. I've known people who use trackballs play just as good as standard mouse players, and the Steam Controller is supposedly able to mimic trackballs perfectly."

valve,38pora,zachiswak,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:29:46 2015 UTC,"Existing controllers already do a decent job at platformers and such games, Steam controllers main goal is to fix games that aren't so fun with controllers, and the main one is FPS games. Now, given that CSGO is Valve's own game, you can bet that they've tested the shit out of it on that game.  Furthermore, anyone will be able to make ""bindings"" and layouts for any game and post them on Steam, and then you'll be able to either make your own, or if lazy, use someone else's premade layout. But I'm sure Valve will have their own layout for their own games for use.  In past videos they've shown their layout for Portal 2, and since that's another FPS game, I'm sure it'll be similar to their CSGO layout."
valve,38pora,Ph0X,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:25:04 2015 UTC,"I Dunno if they have said the ""main one"" that is hard to play with a controller is FPS.  The idea is to make games that traditionally require a mouse to work.  If you see a genre (like FPS) that is very common on consoles, then the steam controller is not trying to ""fix"" anything about that genre.  Now all that said, this don't mean the steam controllers can't be someone's preferred FPS controller, or that it won't be good at it."

Also, there's no reason they would make HL3 just because of this.

valve,38pf4i,kkjdroid,5,Sat Jun 6 03:38:14 2015 UTC,"The cost of living is different, for one. That's why regional pricing exists to begin with.  In general items in Brazil cost less than their American counterparts but they get substantially less money on average, too. Brazil, relative to America, gets much less spending money after bills, food and taxes than the US does.  Similar issues happen in NZ where we get paid more but everything costs more as well, yet publishers decide to charge us more despite the fact we get the same spending money as the US does after bills and shit. The cost of living is relative, yet the publishers don't give two shits."

valve,38pf4i,friendlyoffensive,-1,Sun Jun 7 00:50:24 2015 UTC,"I live in Russia. I was pushed to buy Dying light instead of GTA5 before because GTA5 is 3 times more expensive. Now Bethesda decided to charge more too. Elder Scrolls Online costs 72 bucks for example (4099 rubles). Considering that average wage is 400 bucks (average like one guy have 20 apples and 9 guys have nothing - average is 2 apples), minimum is 80 and unemployed benefits is 10 it seems like a motherfucking luxury to buy Bethesda's new games. And we can't even trade em. I can buy 10 copies of Fallout New Vegas (20 on current sale) instead of one pre-order of Fallout 4. I kinda can purchase, but I surely will not support this. Maybe Bethesda decided to sell games as luxury items (like Apple sells their iPhones here) or something. Also for me a lot of big publishers upped the prices 3 times last year. Only pushed guys like me into piracy (and I have something like thousand games on steam). Indie scene seems to make profit out of this though as a lot of indie games actually lowered prices."

valve,38jd1y,CaesarRoyale,5,Thu Jun 4 20:52:45 2015 UTC,I used one at PAX East. It doesn't feel like you would expect a TouchPad would.

valve,38jgo7,eCir_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"I'd hope there would be some sort of system that actually checked ranks, play time, ability etc. and if there was a correlation, the smurfs would be punished."
valve,38jgo7,eCir_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:24:50 2015 UTC,"for almost everyone ive ever played with that smurfs, myself included, there have only ever been 2 reasons: 1) play with your buddy who is lower ranks and 2) it is the first game of the day or youre tired and just want to play the game casually with some friends, not super competitively. both of these a so easily fixable its just laughable. literally every other game has a casual mode (same rules as a competitive mode, but no ranks only hidden elo to keep it closeish)   but.. valve doesnt feel the need to do anything about it for the past few years, so i will continue to drop 50 bombs on lower ranks and make everyone feel like shit. and frankly i dont give a shit because this is a fundamental need in the game that valve has continually ignored, like all the other isues with the game - there is no reason i shouldnt be allowed to play the game the way it was designed to be played with my friend (5v5 and not this 10v10 horse shit they call casual) even though hes a lower rank.   please dont start the ""oh casual is a good alternative"" bullshit argument. it only works when there is hope on the horizon for an update that doesnt include more skins.   the second valve gets their shit together ill stop smurfing, but until then im going to play with my friends and have fun because thats why i play this game."
valve,38jgo7,supersecretsecret,2,Fri Jun 5 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"So because Valve won't make your game better, you proceed to ruin the game for everybody else? You, Sir, are what we call a massive cunt. An inconsiderate cunt.    Smurfing IS AN ISSUE IN THE GAME, yet you still do it because somehow you think it's going to fix the issue?    so i will continue to drop 50 bombs on lower ranks and make everyone feel like shit     You're clearly that kid who goes around kicking cats because your life is so insignificant and unfulfilled that you need to make everybody else's life as miserable as your own.    Get YOUR shit together, cunt. Want to play casually, PLAY CASUAL. Don't come into competitive and play against Silvers just because you can't be fucking bothered..."
valve,38jgo7,seanz0r,0,Sun Jun 7 19:45:29 2015 UTC,"i actually had a good chuckle while reading this, thanks.   and thanks for the assumptions about my personal life, but they are actually pretty far off. i would never kick a cat, even though im allergic.  oh and who said anything about silvers? lol ive tried to get placed in silver before - its incredibly difficult actually. anyway, i hate to be that guy, but if youre looking for valve to fix something, youre going to be here awhile. were actually in the same boat really - we both want something fixed and it just isnt going to happen (based off of the evidence given thus far) the difference is, im having fun with my solution. that is actually the only reason i play games.. isnt that the reason most people play games - to have fun?   so.. am i cheating? no. am i breaking any rules by playing at a lower rank than i am capable of achieving? i am not actually sure.. i didnt read the fine print if were being honest, but my feeling is no, i dont think i am. its like saying is it rude to not hold the door for someone? maybe. am i breaking some law by not holding the door for someone else? i doubt it. should i hold the door? probably. am i morally obligated to hold said door just because someone else thinks i should? i tend to think not.   feel free to keep yapping about something you feel is a problem - one you cant even really prove apart from personal confession (which even then cant really be proved.. i could be lying), but just keep in mind it is a personal opinion, just like anything i write.. its just an opinion. clearly this concept is lost on you however, since the second someone disagrees or appears to be doing something that isnt quite to your liking, even though it isnt necessarily wrong.. you turn to personal attacks on their character.. fuck the argument. this guy doesnt think like me so he must be a shit bag right? hmm not necessarily. sometimes he might be, but you shouldnt always jump to that conclusion. again.. just my opinion though"
valve,38jgo7,seanz0r,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:15:37 2015 UTC,"It's obviously not a problem to you because you're the one committing said offence. You have to put yourself in other people's shoes. Using your analogy, how would you feel if someone right before you opened the door and then didn't hold it? Or if you held the door open for someone and they didn't say thanks? You'd think they were being rude (off-topic: this actually happened to me - stood for a good few seconds waiting for them to reach the door, held it open, and she glanced at me and said nothing).  Anyway, seeing as you think the football analogy wasn't good enough, I'll give you another one.    Steroids and other drugs in sports. Doping in cycling. Blood transfusions in cycling. There's so many different analogies I could give you. Better yet, I can give you the DEFINITION of 'Cheating':   Cheating is the getting of a reward for ability by dishonest means or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation.   I like this second part:   It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation.   It IS cheating, regardless of what you seem to think it is. Players have the unfair advantage of being much, much better over the newer, worse players. It IS a problem."
valve,38jgo7,seanz0r,0,Wed Jun 10 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"you keep using words like ""offense"" and ""cheating"" but i cant seem to recall ever breaking any rules. the problem with your analogies is that they are based off of acts that are explicitly illegal or breaking of set rules. i am not doing anything illegal or breaking any set rules therefore i cant accept your analogies as valid points in this discussion because they imply actions of wrongdoing that are not only baseless, but not a part of the discussion.   regardless of how rude it might be, or how culturally unacceptable, or how annoyed you might get that someone isnt holding the door for you - or even saying thank you or not, you can NOT arrest someone for NOT holding the door for you because it is NOT illegal.   therefore regardless of how slighted you feel, or how annoyed you might be at it, you cant call smurfing cheating or breaking the rules because it simply is not. you cant ask for a conviction for something that isnt a crime.   change the rules! make everyone hold the door and if they dont, then arrest them and sentence them to life in jail! ... this would be fine if it actually passed. i doubt it will ever pass, but if it did, then i would hold the door for people. you can call for a change in the rules, but you cant call for conviction on something that isnt a crime.   again, i really feel like were more in the same boat than you think. neither one of us is asking valve to fix something that is being done that is explicitly illegal (cheating or scamming/stealing skins). what we are asking for to be changed are just minor inconveniences that would make our lives and presumably a great number of other players better: i want a casual mode with the same rules and no rank restrictions, and you want no more smurfs. to be perfectly honest i think we are asking for the same thing, or rather the end result would be the same, but its valve so i highly doubt anything will actually happen - except more skins that is."

CHEATING.    Doesn't matter if it's against the rules or not. It ruins the game for everybody else, and IMO that IS against the rules."
valve,38jgo7,PsychoYam,0,Fri Jun 12 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"so, let me get this straight.. just because you dont like something, but it isnt against rules.. its considered ""cheating"" to you?   and let me also get this straight.. even if it isnt against the rules, youre going to keep treating it as such? just because you dont like it?   i tried that argument when i was like 9. it never worked then and its not going to work now. get the fuck over it you inbred autistic fuck. you cant even think straight and youre calling me stupid? and it actually does matter if its against the rules because if it isnt, im not doing anything wrong and youre the fuckstick who cant see that. and if you still dont like that, then you dont like the rules of the fucking game, and what im doing is just a byproduct of the system you support. but i cant expect some half wit who cant even formulate a coherent argument to understand this. then again, you are just being a little bitch and crying about smurfs as an ""epidemic"" so i guess i should have know from that too.   come back when you learn to logic. maybe then you can actually contribute something. good talk though. this is the longest discussion ive ever had with someone who has a mental disorder."

You tell me to 'learn to logic', yet you have failed to actually defeat my point. All you've done is dismiss it.  I've already stated my case (by the definition of cheating, smurfing is exactly that), and I'm STILL waiting for Captain Autismo (you, if you hadn't gotten the hint - I know you need help understanding things sometimes) over here to give me a valid argument as to why smurfing isn't cheating and why it's not an issue.    What amuses me even further is that you talk about forming coherent arguments, yet you've failed to do so every time I present my argument to you. What are you waiting for, clever-clogs?

I imagine it'll have something to do with how much you do it too, but I'm just wondering.  I could see this being more for people who have actual problems with the game.  Like glitches or bugs, or perhaps their computer is unable to run it at a reasonable framerate.  Not for people that just want to try games and see how they are.  If so, everyone would be buying every game on Steam, trying it, then refunding it.  That could get rather messy."

I used to be pretty hopeful of finding out what was going to happen to the mute protagonist and all his allies.  The last 10 years - well, what happened? Minerva Metastasis showed what someone could do with the same assets and a better, darker story in his spare time. Countless other games came and went raising the bar faster than ever before. Wolfenstein New Order put the icing on the cake by waltzing up to the genre, stealing Gordons lunch money and kicking him in the nuts.   HL3 it will never succeed like HL2 i/ii because we have tasted sweeter fruit and to keep with the story they will inevitably be aiming for a gamestyle that is stale and pasee. Deviation will be slated as 'Not True HL' and keeping with the spirit will be slammed as Yet Another Corridor Shooter.  So yep - waiting for HL3 - been there, done that, gave back the tee shirt."

And there will never be a better game than ""Wolfenstein New Order""? I'm not sure how you figure HL3 is any different than anything else in production right now.  EVERY game needs to be better than anything in the past.  What makes you think Valve wouldn't hire the best team in the world to make HL3?  And why wouldn't they succeed with unlimited time and resources (something only Blizzard and Valve can afford)?    Not even sure what ""waiting for Half Life 3"" means.  You've given up waiting?

It has now been so long that to please the followers from 10 years ago and please new gamers who are not wedded to the history is nigh impossible. Top it off with the mentioned/rumoured info that Valve devs (who all have a free arm in choosing their projects) have shied from HL3 due to that most basic of precepts ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"". Who wants to be the one that screwed the pooch? They are aware that after such a long time the two fan bases, that can't be fulfilled at the same time, drift ever apart.  I hope there is a HL3. I hope there is one that lives up to your wishes. I sincerely do, but I'm not waiting for it at all for myself.  We (a general 'we' - those who wait for HL3) are our own worst enemies."

valve,382zpi,myclykaon,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"First, I hate the nostalgia argument. It's absurd to think that older games are worse than the modern game. For example Starcraft: Brood War has fantastic gameplay, and story. Those two things don't age. People still read Shakespeare, J.R.R Tolkien, and Lewis Carrol's writings. Their words may not be the same as today, but the message is still the same. Obviously the graphics are bad compared to the modern day's, but that will happen with every game. In 20 years graphics will be so far advanced that the current graphics will be looked back on as terrible.  Second, no one is ""waiting"" for HL3. It's either going to release, or it's not. The decision is Valve's and Valve's alone.  Third, no one is ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"". Obviously the hype for this game as grown to astronomical proportions. However, even if the developers don't live up to the hype, then life will just continue. We will still use Steam, continue playing Dota/CS:GO, and Valve will continue making money. If they do live up to they hype, then it will be the game of the century. If Half-Life 3 releases then no one would complain it's ""yet another corridor shooter"". This isn't an over milked zombie franchise. This is an under-milked series that has game of the decade awards. I have no idea how they would deviate from the original gameplay, but if they do (and it's a good game) then it will continue to get praise. HL1 and HL2 both had differences in their gameplay. HL2 was more on-rails then HL1, but that didn't stop it from getting a higher rating than the original.  I kind of went on a tangent, but I just hate it when people say nostalgia keeps things alive. I started playing Diablo 2 in 2007, I continue to play it today because Diablo 3 is terrible (IMO). I also play the original Diablo now and again. Not because of nostalgia, but for the gameplay and atmosphere."

I salute you - not only have you missed the point, you did it so well you have actually wasted your time typing and my time reading. If you think, even for a nanosecond, that is my point, there is not just no point continuing this, there is less than no point continuing this.

valve,382zpi,taylorules,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"I write forum/Reddit posts in Notepad++ and I think I got my tabs mixed up. That first part meant to go on a Diablo 3 forum...  First, nostalgia does not keep series alive. The reason the series was popular is because the gameplay was that way. No one plays a sequel and loves it purely because the previous was amazing. Supreme Commander is a great example. The first and it's expansion have fantastic ratings. However the sequel removed several gameplay mechanics that fans loved about the original. There are people who prefer Supreme Commander 2 over the original, but the vast majority of players stick to the original. That does not mean people hate new games because they are different than the original. I think Starcraft 2 has many worse gameplay mechanics than Brood War, but I continue to play it because I enjoy the overall experience.  TL;DR, nostalgia does not keep any series alive, and it does not kill sequels either. The game is either good, or bad."

valve,37jqmj,Stikanator,1 point,Thu May 28 08:05:58 2015 UTC,I have had problems with valve games before. I reset windows using windows 8.1. Choose the one that keeps all your files tho. Otherwise all ur games will disappear. Then simply go through the process and your pc will be significantly faster as well (if it's an oldish one). It does delete programs though. So you will need to reinstall steam and all ur drivers. But that takes little time. You won't have to redownload games.  Seriously try this. It fixed a lot of crashes and general problems I was having with games

A service like OnLive will be the real console (and PC) killer when American infrastructure is ready for it. If the Steam Link is ever extended to communicate with giant GPU clusters hundreds of miles away, then, sure. But for as long as the product stays at household scope, which is how it's being marketed, then I don't see it being any more than a leisurely purchase."

valve,3732a7,guusert,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"Warning: most things in this comment may sound really obvious.  The Steam Link doesn't get a video signal from the computer. It is fundamentally different than a HDMI/VGA/whatever cable. It picks up more information (to get sound). And it sends information to the PC (so we get Big Picture and to control Steam/game). It is connected to the same network as that of the computer(s). It automatically detects PC's on which Steam is running. So you switch your TV signal to the HDMI port to which the Steam Link is connected. It will immediately show you the Steam Big Picture mode, made to control Steam with a controller. Now you're good to go. The sound of the games is picked up by the Steam Link. The controller (Steam controller, 360 controller, xbox one, logitech) you are using is directly linked with the Steam Link. It's like a stream media box, but for games.   Normally you would have to configure your controller in Windows, connect your HDMI cable from your PC to your TV, select your TV as monitor in Windows, select your TV for sound output and put Steam in Big Picture mode. That is a shit ton of work just to play a game! And you also have to have a HDMI laying on the ground from your PC to your TV.   This is something I've been waiting for for years and it's fucking awesome to see it coming out soon! The price is beyond amazing! This is a console killer. The thing why console players won't adapt to it though, is that you still have to build a game PC and have to have both the Steam link and the PC on the same wired network. Another thing is split screen... I do not think game developers are going to implement split screen in PC games. And a big reason to play on a TV is to play with friends on a couch.  My questions are:   Will the game be playing in the background and sending the video and audio without you visually noticing it on your computer? I doubt this will happen, but at the same time I don't see why it wouldn't. Will it be possible to play a game on your computer at the same time? (unlike family sharing) Of course this is not gonna work for low end PCs and games that demand much. How do the other controllers work with the Steam Link? Do I connect my 360 wireless receiver (dongle) to the Steam Link via USB? Can I use multiple controllers with one dongle? Does it need drivers? What is the video bitrate? A normal LAN network can transfer at least 100 Mbit/s I believe. My internet download speed alone is 93 Mbit/s. Please do not say they are using a ridiculously low bitrate. I'm searching for 1080p gaming bitrate comparisons now."

If you want to change the name you will have to perform a title transfer. The process is different in every state, but you always need a title transfer application and the Volvo's VIN, a number that is unique to the car used for identification purposes. It can be located on a metal plate either inside the Volvo's hood or inside the driver's side door. Some states may also require other things like the odometer reading or a bill of sale. If you want to find the requirements for your specific state you can go to http://www.dmv.org/title-transfers.php"

valve,36v5x4,Talon88,7,Fri May 22 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"It's frustrating not because of the bug itself, but because Valve goes through this sense of theater that implies they're going to start caring about what their customers say, but never do. If this were just some obscure bug report on the Steam Forums somewhere, I'd agree. But this is a bug that:   Impacts Linux the most (but not by any means exclusively), after Valve has said over and over how ""important"" Linux gaming is to them. And it isn't a minor bug either; it's a bug that totally destroys teamwork and cooperation cross-platform, which the company is supposed to be all about. Is reported on their Github, which is supposed to be the #1 place to get bugs fixed. The README states ""Please use this repository to report bugs and feature requests for Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and the Source 1 Engine."" However, time and time again Valve has proven that this Github is theater and nothing more. Bugs get fixed once they cause PR problems for Valve (i.e. a highly upvoted post on a game's subreddit), not when they are reported in a calm and reasonable manner. This promotes more whining and more public shaming, and less calm, collected, and detailed bug reports.   It's not just the bug, it's the fact that folks have done everything right in reporting it and it's gone unfixed for over a year - not because the community has done anything wrong, but because there's not been a PR shitstorm about it yet. The fact that the bug is reported correctly and impacts the platform that Valve continually makes grand gestures toward, but (as evidenced by this and other things) clearly doesn't give an actual shit about.  This isn't about just the bug. It's about the hypocrisy the bug represents too."

I mean most people don't even rely on steam voice they use ventrillo to compete competitively.. If the owner of the server set voice chat from 0 to 1 it works... Can you explain why its a bug or how its a bug if the server owner has to and can change this option... And not every server is owned by valve so people can be hosting dedicated servers for the servers you play on

I can assume that I'm the only linux player (or maybe there are few others but it is not matter actually) and the owners of the servers doesn't want to change working configuration for single player. I can understand them, because if configuration works well for thousand users then is it probably something wrong with that one, not with configs.    Can you explain why its a bug   So, it is the bug because I can not use voice in-game"
valve,36v5x4,awkisopen,2,Fri May 22 13:03:25 2015 UTC,"The only fix to this is to change the default in a patch but then again, server owner should change it because its not hard to change a setting it shouldn't affect everyone.

I think that its just responsibility of server host and not so much a bug on valve part I mean its frustrating but keep in mind valve and devs are just starting to like roll out support for Linux like actively. Not too many people play on Linux I. Suppose. And maybe there is server admin or server mod that can change that?"
valve,36v5x4,BaguetteFaguette,5,Fri May 22 17:01:25 2015 UTC,It's not that simple. sv_use_steam_voice 1 disables some parts of server culture like HLDJ and other music/sound streaming software. Servers default to sv_use_steam_voice 1; setting it to 0 is a deliberate choice on the server owners' part and likely has some reasoning behind it.

And I strongly believe that this bug should be fixed. But is not for two years. And the worst is the fact that Valve doesn't even give any comments about the issue.   You may say that even with this I should not write this post in the manner I did it. And you'll be right. And I'm sorry about this. But believe me, the problem does exist.

valve,36nv2g,ZERO_ice,1 point,Wed May 20 19:16:58 2015 UTC,"As it was said by Valve numerous times, the cut is dictated by the publisher and not them so the cut would have been much different depending on the game.  As for your third-party content concern, that's an issue with workshop titles in general.  The publishers themselves are expected to monitor their title's workshop content and make sure copyright is respected. If they don't then DCMA's can be filed and afaik it lands solely on the publishers lap at the end of the day.  Also paid mods were required to be approved by the workshop maintainers before going on sale, so it should be expected of the maintainers to do their due diligence and make sure no one's ripping of other people's content to begin with (but they aren't necessarily obligated to, as was stated by Valve, and this is where some a lot of people's issues came from).  Obviously though even if they were obligated to screen things, nothing's perfect so there'd be slip ups anyway.. and that's why Valve probably should have thought of some way to deal with stolen content from the get go that was fair to consumers (though I think the plan was to issue refunds in the case that a mod was pulled -- since they ended up doing this anyway).  Anywho, you're probably wasting your breath. No one seems to want to discuss paid mods, they just want to instantly shoot the idea down because they feel entitled to getting things for free. Which sucks, because ultimately this idea wasn't that bad, and Valve's implementation wasn't far off from being pretty decent."

If your account got hijacked with credit in your steam wallet and someone bought loads of junk off the market they would not be able to sell it on immediately. That week should be long enough to contact Steam support and change your passwords. Although I do believe there should be an option to toggle this on and off however with the same message you got from turning email verification off.  I dont believe that it is ruining the community as only a small minority of people use the market and it has not stopped me or many other players from using it. personally I think the market has only been gaining strength recently with the addition of limited items, strange cosmetics and killstreak parts; the only reason I can imagine anyone using the mann co store above the market is if they want a specific cosmetic  or from new key releases."
valve,36a19e,King-of-Mars,14,Sun May 17 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"The main reason always been to stop price volatility and speculations (buy cheap, fast retrade with %), not hack protection. And it works. I dont think they will remove this."
valve,36a19e,desimaldevil,-1,Sun May 17 18:15:51 2015 UTC,"So the purpose is to stop sudden changes in the value on the market having a large effect on trading prices quickly? Surely given the markets clarity and more direct link to supply/demand in terms of an items pricing, which I think is what causes the volatility, may create unwanted volatility in trading prices. But in my opinion this volatility is needed as with the lack of a such a direct link to supply/demand prices tend to stagnate and stay high when there is clearly an overabundance. Especially when lower priced items have such a dependence on sites such as backpack.tf"
valve,36a19e,not_from_this_world,6,Sun May 17 18:41:08 2015 UTC,"Supply/demand is subject to speculation. If I buy enough items to make their price rise, other people may hype the prospect of a good sell and sell them at high rates too. Then all the suddenly I sell all of my stock at high prices, while the hype is kicking in. It work wonders in small economy systems, like valve's or some MMO's out there. Happens in real world too. Naji Nahas broke the (then) small Brazil's stock market in the 80's doing exactly that. Google translated article"
valve,36a19e,P373R1,0,Mon May 18 06:27:14 2015 UTC,"But you can sell items on the market immediately after purchasing them from the market just not trade them. Also if someone did purchase up lots of an item to sell at a higher price how would delaying them from selling it trading change anything other that when they sold it. Even if this did happen and the delay did stop this and you couldn't sell on the market immediately anyway, the ban as it is is still way more inconvenient than a few items becoming more expensive because someone has cornered the market."
valve,36a19e,P373R1,3,Mon May 18 22:52:57 2015 UTC,"Someone has mentioned that this is to combat quick reselling (buying an item super cheap, and then listing back up for profit) but I dont think valve cares about that on the scale of normal trading.    Valve only care about locking their system down for when bugs and currency conversion issues occur. eg. when the price bug happened early may, and people from India were able to buy things from the market, really cheap in their currency. Valve wants to stop them instantly re-listing them at a higher price (so other people with the currency bug cant rebuy them) as this devalues the economy, and people can buy keys for super cheap on the market with the profit they make.    Key unboxings can not be reverted. which is a direct loss to valves profit. as they are getting like 20c USD for keys that are normally $2.50 USD.    Additionally, The 7 day market restriction also has a different effect on new items. new items are generally subject to price fluctuations early in their lifetime. and buying to resell is no longer an option.  Please note that after the currency conversion issue, valve implemented the 7 day cool down on reselling items in CSGO. And they removed it roughly 6 days after. meaning that it is not a required feature for CSGO, but still in place for Dota2 and TF2 (probably other games too)"
valve,36a19e,Broseph_McTatertots,1 point,Mon May 18 00:02:36 2015 UTC,"If that bug were to occur again then the delay would not stop this bug being taken advantage of because you can still sell skins on the market place after you've bought them just not trade them. i would also like to add that valve benefits from the delay for selling items after the opening of chests/crates (including from me) in dota/tf2 because the true (very low) value of the item's you unbox is hidden, due to there being far less people who can sell the items on the market, making the chests seem way more valuable than they are."
valve,36a19e,gravy_ferry,1 point,Mon May 18 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"maybe im re-itterating myself but:   Yes, I made a post saying ""Wow, valve have implemented, and then removed the market restriction from newly bought CSGO skins"" http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/35k6tl/psa_globaloffensive_items_are_now_instantly/.compact which some people commented on. it means they are probably either: - happy to take a hit on CSGO skins if the currency bug happens again - or they are super confident that currency bugs will not happen again in the future (and they are reverting the marketplace back to how it was because currency bugs are no longer a threat.)    Yes, I tried to work the Dota2 and TF2 chest marketability into my response. but I feel that the initial 30 days untradability is more of a big deal than that, rather than the 7 day market restriction that applies once the 30 days are up.    The 7 market/trade restriction however is amazing for new item sets once they hit the market, because people are not snatching them up to resell for 2c profit. because in 7 days time, the price will have fluctuated. this results in new chests and crate items being really cheap upon hitting the marketplace. as so many people are getting rid of their doubles, and mostly only people who plan on using the cosmetics are the ones buying them. (buyers market)    And, also, as you mentioned, the 30 day period where these new items are unmarketable and untradeable is amazing for valve retaining value on the new things they release. 90% of the population have to unbox chests to get their hands on the new items, potentially meaning more sales, as full price is the only way to get new items . it stops the devaluation of new chest valve release."

valve,362cvz,MetroidAndZeldaFan,8,Fri May 15 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"I want it primarily because there is a cyclical nature to support; for devs to target linux for release, there needs to be a linux distro that is as accessible to the user as windows is, and for users who wish use an alternative to windows, they need a library of games and support for them.  I want a steam OS to succeed not because I'm uninformed of other distros, but because I believe such large-scale support will help ""normalize"" linux development.  I can kludge together a much better environment for my needs than SteamOS, but it's not really worthwhile to me when the majority of my existing steam library is dependent on windows."

valve,362cvz,ProfessorStupidCool,4,Fri May 15 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"DirectX floats as an intermediary layer between the game and the hardware, which is good.  The reason it's so diverse is because of how large its API library has become.  However, it has also become very bloated and creates problems with cross console/PC development.  It eats up a lot of resources, while other graphic APIs are more elegant.  It employs a ""kitchen sink"" philosophy which means floating it in the RAM can take up more overhead than other similar APIs.  I'm open to DX12; microsoft has claimed that they're addressing these and other issues.  There's another problem though, aside from how quickly a game can run - directX is microsoft only; it's closed off, it locks games in to one market, which lowers diversity.  I have moral and ethical issues with the design philosophy behind closed source single-os libraries, as well, but I won't get into that as it's off topic."
valve,362cvz,ciny,5,Fri May 15 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"while other graphic APIs are more elegant.   Which one? Vulcan is still in diapers and opengl is anything but elegant and easy to work with. the reason devs use directx so much is that the api is consistent, backwards compatible to a certain extent and with great documentation."
valve,362cvz,MetroidAndZeldaFan,1 point,Fri May 15 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"elegant in terms of overhead.  The only reason directX has all these things is because it holds a monopoly.  Other alternatives would have more support if microsoft hadn't cornered the PC game market.  DirectX has all of the problems it does because it has no reason to get better; it's the only option.  Monolithic single-option markets are terrible, capitalism doesn't work without competition, and directX has been slowly deteriorating."

If you're running bots, not only does it have to handle your input, handle your graphics, handle the physics simulation for all players, but it also has to run the AI to perform the decision making for the bots.   If you have a second computer, you could attempt to distribute some of the load by running the game on the server and connecting to it from your preferred computer; then the server cpu would handle the physics simulation and the AI, and you client CPU would handle only your session and input."

valve,349h9l,TheNitromunkey,0,Wed Apr 29 11:28:43 2015 UTC,"The current system is fine and i will be happy if it stay like that (I always used mod of the Elder Scroll series). But if mods are one day monetized (and they will be), we need to find an healthy way to do it."
valve,3436lm,Iamfullyshibe,17,Mon Apr 27 23:07:05 2015 UTC,It's as if a million voices cried out at once and were ... heeded?
valve,3436lm,NelsonJamdela,13,Mon Apr 27 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"i consider valve the good guy, valve really was trying to do the right thing and to be honest about it, how ever just as valve say'd trying to do this to an established modding community is going to piss people who feel entitled to those mods for free since they always have been getting them. but i really hope they get this to work correctly just on a game that doesn't have an established modding community."
valve,3436lm,tolesto,22,Tue Apr 28 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"I hope Valve finds a way to roll this out in a manner that doesn't piss off the community.  As a modder who has spent over $30,000 of his life savings building a mod, I would have loved to have had a means to recoup that.  I almost certainly would have used the comfort gained from having a degree of financial freedom to double down and make the mod even better for users.  By the way, 25% is a heck of a lot better of a deal than our team was offered.  We had to politely ask Id for written permission to distribute our mod FOR FREE on PC Gamer magazine CDs."
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,12,Mon Apr 27 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"30,000 dollars on what? Holy fuck I too am a mod creator and cannot fathom what would cost that much."
valve,3436lm,CataChaos1320,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:37:54 2015 UTC,1.5 years of dedicated work.  Three other teammates in the same boat.
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,11,Mon Apr 27 23:39:48 2015 UTC,If you quit your day job to mod without income then you made the wrong choice.
valve,3436lm,LastImmortalMan,6,Mon Apr 27 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, after we shipped our mod, we turned it into a full company.  We built content for nearly ten years for publishers. That was a lot of hard work.  I think it would have been better if we could have simply just focused on making mods.  Incorporating a company, signing a lease, hiring 50+ employees... and then having to ship milestones to publishers.  All of that, just because we wanted to play the games we modded.  I think Valve's plan would have been a lot less convoluted than what we had to do. And we would have been a lot more connected to the customers."
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,4,Mon Apr 27 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that there just aren't enough people who are like you and your team. There are so many people who will spend the 20 minutes it takes to make a beggar, an apple, what have you, and try and milk the easy work for as much money as possible.  That's when you get a mod for an apple for $30. That's just wrong. To the gamers in the community and to you and other creators.   Sure, it would have been nice for you to be paid for your work, but was there a real plan to make your job making those mods in the beginning? Unfortunately, the system put in place allowed there to be steaming piles of shit for money, for real money. There are a lot of people who put work into modding the games they like to play, and when they started I am going to bet very few of them had intent to make money off their mod. While I want there to be a system of support, the system that was put in place was the wrong system for this age of software. People will be lazy if they can, and people will be greedy as often as possible. This led to the train wreck we saw. Which is really unfortunate, because there are a number of people who are like you. Invested in something with the potential to make money off it. The problem with this system was that there was no ""investment meter"". If the kid who programmed the apple mod had any investment in his program, he would have done more than that, because it would benefit the community and himself. Instead, he just makes it for him, so that he can make money for him.   Maybe if there were less shitty people in the world."
valve,3436lm,averyminya,2,Tue Apr 28 00:14:56 2015 UTC,"I can assure you that there have always been free mods that aren't worth your time as gamer, too.  As someone who has played Doom wads continuously since 1994, I can tell you I've downloaded a ton of bad free maps. Greed isn't the only reason bad mods are made.    We had 50,000 live players on the first day because we had a pretty well known name in the Quake community, and because we sent out review copies to magazines and websites.  They reviewed us like a game, or maybe an expansion pack.  I'm positive that the community and press would have organized around great mods worthy of your time and dime if the system had a chance to grow.  But for a confluence of reasons, it didn't, with Skyrim and Steam Workshop.   Sure, it would have been nice for you to be paid for your work, but was there a real plan to make your job making those mods in the beginning?    Yes, by hook or by crook.  We were going to work on great multiplayer games and then play the shit out of them."
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,2,Tue Apr 28 00:40:25 2015 UTC,"I think the real problem was the split, and the curation system. Or rather, the lacking of one.  Personally, I think modders who put time and effort into their mods deserve at the very LEAST, a donation button on their page.  If you compensate people for their work, they're going to keep doing it.  The problem is very clearly the split and the lack of a curation system.  People putting small/worthless mods up for exorbitant prices is not a problem.  It's a non-issue."
valve,3436lm,studiosupport,2,Tue Apr 28 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"The split?  I assume you mean 25% to the modders.  Go start a company -- give it a shareholder's loan of $100,000 so you can get started hiring, building an Internet presence and buying office equipment.  Get a group of experienced founders together, sign an office lease and install desks and computers.  Now you're in a position to do work.  Next, pound the pavement.  Meet key people at, say, Bethesda, Blizzard, Epic or Id.  Meet their publishers, often the parties funding the work.  Get them all to agree to work with you at some price.   Tell them you'd like to make an expansion pack for their game.  Ask them if you can have 25% of gross revenue, no veto rights to all reasonable content, and you can release it without presenting them a schedule based on what you think fans want in a given moment.    Good luck getting even 1% of gross revenue."
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,2,Tue Apr 28 15:59:36 2015 UTC,"Except, most modders don't need to do that.  Most modders are doing it on their own free time and expecting nothing.  25% may be okay in your mind, but in my mind the modder should be getting the lion's share since they're the one doing the work.  You can use your personal experience to bolster your presence in this conversation but it does nothing to support your argument when you're in the vast minority."
valve,3436lm,studiosupport,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"I think the peoples refusal to accept this argument of comparison to the present alternatives is actually a brilliant and refreshing moment of large-scale awareness and foresight. Those things mobs are supposed to be incapable of. This paid mod program isn't about right now, and not about what's otherwise permitted - it's about the future (the mods yet to be developed, or not developed, sold or not sold), and about what's POSSIBLE. That's the key word here. Beth could just let people sell their mods, full stop. Just remove the barriers they've themselves already actively put in place. That's possible. It wouldn't even necessarily be the best outcome for gamers/creators (workshop really is a great service that does better than the chaos of free internet for content distribution/matching), but it's possible. Valve could likewise drop their fee. It's not even a question of either company earning their profit to stay in business, they definitely don't need this additional income, at all... yet, right now. In the future, after a paid modding system like they tried is fully formed and the norm, there would probably be no going back (just like DLC itself that has become the norm - it was a shitty anti-consumer practice that was pure greed, and recognized as such, at the time of inception - but now is just intractable, and seemingly inescapable).  In short Valves shitty paid mod system as presented was clearly really a way to kill modding and turn would-be mod creators into cut-rate, totally independent (not receiving any up-front investment) DLC makers. It's really hard to sincerely believe it was conceived as anything else. In fact it's impossible. Valve showed their true colors here, and -surprise!- they're really just another megacorp.  This incident was potentially our Horse Armor for the next advancement in DLC. Could still be, if we're not careful. I really feel like maybe now more than ever, after this withdrawal, is the real time to strike with something like a blackout, as was proposed. To make it clear to Valve (and Bethsoft), that we are indeed exercising foresight and awareness, and that we are not going to let this incident be mere 'inoculation' for an inevitable return."
valve,3436lm,eugd,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:29:16 2015 UTC,"This incident was potentially our Horse Armor for the next advancement in DLC. Could still be, if we're not careful.    The community has already accepted hats (cosmetics).  I don't see how that is different than horse armour.  Should only the original developers be invested in giving you options as to how you enjoy your game?   Those things mobs are supposed to be incapable of.   Historically, anthropomorphizing mobs and attributing intelligence to them is a predecessor to extremely dangerous actions.    If there is any wisdom in the crowd, it's individual outliers, buoyed by the temporal sway of a mob.  Don't mistake your own strength for having a lion in your corner that happens to be looking at someone else like they're food."
valve,3436lm,frogtoss,2,Tue Apr 28 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"You knew that you wouldn't make money, yet you still made the mods.

valve,3436lm,fockface,3,Tue Apr 28 03:25:41 2015 UTC,"I said it would be ""nice"" to recoup.  However, you are saying you only want mods when there is a synergistic benefit for the creator.  I can only conclude you are greatly underestimating how far people will go to build entertainment that benefits you if you help guarantee they can continue to pay their mortgages and fill the fridge for the foreseeable future.  You have no idea how many emails we received asking us to do various mods for people's favourite games.  In some cases, we would have loved to, too.

I think it should be implemented somehow, just clearly not the way it was since so many disagreed with it.   I think a nice place to start would be a donate function- as a level editor, I see very little incentive to output content and haven't for a long time. Adding a way to profit that's non-mandatory for users would be cool but I don't think essentially turning any game into a micro-transaction market is ever a good idea. Especially with only 25% user revenue...  I'm mostly glad they decided to heed the community's voices, but I still do see potential in that sort of system. Just my thoughts."

It just needs to be done right.  Valve should start with Half-Life series mods. I'm pretty sure if the Black Mesa devs had the incentive of getting paid all these years (and someday, of course, they will) we would have seen it completed a long, long time ago."
valve,3436lm,cunningmunki,-4,Tue Apr 28 09:39:16 2015 UTC,"What i dont understand is how all of a sudden modders need cash for it when they created mods for over a decade for free and only passion driving them to create wonderfull mods.  You can add a paypall option and see people donate out of free will instead of locking massive amount of people out from mods.  Who on earth is going to pay for 200 mods for Skyrim ?  Where would this end it the long run ?  Gamers already getting milked to death, games are to expensive as is.  Day one DLC's   Subscriptions or Season pass.  And now we would have paying for mods ?  It will rise the cost of a simple game to a few hundred euro and this is not gaming....this is milking out the gamers.  There are alot of people out there struggling to upgrade their pc or buy games. This will just push these players into piracy to enjoy gaming as they can no longer afford to keep up with the cost that comes with it.  Modders add a paypall option and none of this is a problem"
valve,33yeu9,wikid24,27,Sun Apr 26 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"Valve has one of the most bullshit tactics for dodging any complaints with their whole steam support ticket system.

valve,33yeu9,A1Gore,5,Mon Apr 27 00:34:51 2015 UTC,"I've had wishes for the Steam client for years, not sure what they're doing at Valve but not innovating with the client or customer support in any case :P  As an example, I wanted to gift games to my friends, I decided to experiment and bought a four pack. Realized I could not gift individual games, but only the entire pack. Gifted my brother, he got one license and three in his inventory which he gifted back to me.   After this I contacted customer support to either see if what I had done was in any way an exploit or if there was a better way of doing it. They responded that what I had done is the only way to do it, with no hint that it would ever change.   Again, I assume they're making tons of cash, but as the employees get to work on what they want, not what customers want, stuff like this might never get solved.  I still like Valve and/or Steam, but this latest mod-debacle sure makes one think again. They keep saying they're doing what they think customers want, or at least that's the impression I got from interviews, not so sure about that though."

valve,33x0ze,aazell,5,Mon Apr 27 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"That's the problem people don't understand it. A good example is the app market you have on your phone. It's a nightmare of free apps full with ads and apps you need to buy but overpriced. We as modding community are not against donating the mod creator. But it is and never should be a job. You already gain experience you can use for future jobs. As soon as you add a price tag you also need to have support, quality control and a price reflecting the overall value of the mod. Right now we have no support on mods that promise me that it will work with all the other mods I have. There is no way to get your money back or to test a mod longer than 24 hours nor is there a quality control if the mod will damage my savegame or not. There is also no one who can tell me if a mod is worth 5€ or not. I need to buy it before I can even test that out.  I have no problem to pay for all mods a price if all the points above are given. But they aren't. On top of that we have the unbelievable split of 25/75 (which is a rip off) and the censoring of comments, ratings and the weak PR talk of GabeN. And additional my personal problems with the Workshop, of automatic updates and removing of mods without telling me. I also see no reason to pay for the 150 mods I use about 600€. Now count the mods I totally installed on skyrim and I am above 2000€. You really think I should pay that much? Now add the fact that in future other publisher will add their mods only to steam workshop and sue people publishing on other platforms because they don't generate revenue for them. This WILL happen. They can say a thousand times it won't. I guarantee it."
valve,33x0ze,PM_ME_YOUR_A_CUP5,-2,Mon Apr 27 16:28:10 2015 UTC,"Most workshops on steam are 85% full of crap. Not worth having. The community are very good at identifying quality mods vs crap.  A 24 hour evaluation period is more than enough to establish whether a mod is crap or not IMO.   Compatibility is another issue and I agree that for Skyrim it is a worry. For other games less so as modding tends to work differently for different games. Skyrim wasn't a great choice for a launch game given the history of modding and how much its brought to the game in general. They would have been better implementing this for a brand new release.  Whether a modder should get paid or not is really a matter of personal opinion. My personal opinion is that if people are willing to pay for something then good luck to the person selling it. The market will determine if its worth something or not.  The 25/75 split certainly gives me pause for thought but if I'm building a mod which previously I would have only been able to offer for free and can now make a little money then I've certainly lost nothing. Hard to grumble about that.  Regardless of the above, as a modder for mainly source games, I can't help but feel that the player community have failed to recognise the value that the modding community bring to the table. Expecting all content that others build for free all the time seems rather unfair given people put many many hours of work into their creations.  Valve and Steam provide thousands of hours of free gaming for an audience of millions. Without Valve, PC gaming would be a very sad place to be indeed... Can you imagine if we all had to use Origin instead? It would be horrible.   So before bashing Valve for allowing mod makers to at least offer their mods for a small fee, think about all that you get for absolutely nothing and thank god you're not a console gamer..."

valve,33x0ze,tolesto,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"Then the fault lies with the game you are developing the mod on (the publishers), and you should have known the implications before you started making a mod for the game of some asshole developers. You can't make a mod and then throw that responsibility and the problems that follow it into the lap of the users (in this case, by justifying a system where only 1/4 of the money spent on your mods actually go to you).  You know what, fuck charging. Mods shouldn't cost anything! Project Realiy was free, and I'm pretty fucking sure you didn't do anything comparable to that. I still donated $100 of my money to the team at PR, and would do it again anytime for any developer that actually deserve the money.  I'm so sick and tired of the people calling users for unserious for ranting about stuff; no! We are ranting because these neoliberal financial institution-cocksuckers keep try injecting their laissez faire, shock therapy capitalism into Gaming, expecting us not to react. Fuck it! The most pathetic thing about this is how they basically only throw a bone to the developers by giving them 1/4 of the share, and these people completely change their view on the matter just because they get a small, slave-like share. Well saying ""expecting us not to react"" is actually wrong, the overwhelming majority of the gaming community are weak-willed assholes who whine about a company and buy the game afterwards; just like how they will buy Battlefront 3 (knowing full well how bad of a product they will get).  Edit: Checked your initial claim, and found out it's total bullshit. Donation can be asked for, for several different reasons. You can put up a donation on your site without specifically referring to the mod itself without getting any legal repercussions for it. Even if you did, it's donation and not purchase."
valve,33x0ze,generalako,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"about the edit thing, the reason you can do that is because then its not considered you are getting donated for your work, but if you do it like that you get pretty much no income for your work because people don't know about it because you cant advertise it in any way.  secondly: on nexus one of the most downloaded mod's got pretty much no donation's for their work.  edit: and please don't be so quick on calling the things i say bullshit, i am only trying to tell the truth."

If a modder wants to release like they use to, they can. If they want to earn some money for the work they have done, they can do that also now.  Valve give people to power to do what they want, so dont hate on them. Hate on your favorite modder who now wants to make a money because they can."
valve,33x0ze,DrakenZA,4,Sun Apr 26 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"It really wouldn't be a problem except Valve is actively taking down negative criticism and banning people left and right and most importantly, they are taking down any and all donation links to mods just so people will use their system and so they can get their cut."

This will be the Sequel to the first one.    Inside we will see games such as Half-Life: The final Chapter, Portal: Across Worlds, Team Fortress: The Quest for More Hats, Left4Dead: Apocalypse and a new physics based game  At least this is what I want to believe."

valve,33xvcy,WhenisHL3,2,Sat May 2 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"I think at this point people need to resign themselves to the fact that Valve isn't going to continue the Half Life series.      They're not so much a company that develops games any more.    They're building out a game distribution system where they're going to curate and sell other companies games.  Gabe's hinted around at it but seems reluctant to come right out and say it, though.     I'm kind of hoping they license it to someone that'll do a decent job.  Either  Avalanche Studios or maybe Naughty Dog."

They have promised us time and time again that it would be released, and now its almost been 8 years since HL: E2 with no concrete evidence that HL 3 is being considered, nevermind developed.  And don't bring up the arguement 'It takes time, be patient, Valve doesn't owe you anything', you're right, but if Valve outright cancelled the game saying some BS like 'The pressure was too high' or something like that, the community backlash would be severe. I mean, come on they've had 8 years to annouce anything.  With the new Source engine on its way, I wouldn't be surprised that HL 3 would be released on it in the next year or so.  But the annoying part about the whole thing, is how personally Gabe has taken criticism towards the whole HL 3 hiatus, whereas he could have released it before now and he wouldn't have to deal with the fans asking him about it every day."

valve,33xvcy,Apocalypseboyz,2,Sun Apr 26 21:37:32 2015 UTC,"No, it's a triquel to Half-Life. It's a sequel to Half-Life 2.  triquel isn't a word anyway, but rather an internet slang. Urban Dictionary is not exactly a very serious dictionary, and contains only descriptions of internet slangs and such. So if you for example search ""NSFW"" on there, you get up results explaining what it is.  Try searching ""triquel"" on http://dictionary.reference.com/, you won't find anything.  If you search ""sequel"", however, you get:   a literary work, movie, etc., that is complete in itself but continues the narrative of a preceding work an event or circumstance following something; subsequent course of affairs.   Word of origin is the Latin word sequela, which means ""that which follows*.  So no, downvote is not wrong; cause he is wrong. Half-Life 3 is a sequel of the Half-Life story. It is a sequel to Half-Life 2 (or rather, Half-Life 2: Episode Two)."
valve,33xvcy,recloos,2,Mon Apr 27 21:00:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, thanks for info, I never know there is no such word in english language, because as I said before, in my native language there is триквел(triquel) and its exist in all dictionaries I found.

valve,33tfkr,DennisvdG,3,Fri May 1 12:18:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's neither. When Gabe was told about valve sensoring reviews on steam, he told us he was unaware of the censorship, and that he would look into it.  afterwards, the person who told him had their ban removed, and so did a few others. I assumed he probably stopped a lot of censorship  at this point and the review was put back."

valve,33tfkr,spatulaboy,3,Sun Apr 26 10:05:51 2015 UTC,"The main problem is that this is, essentially, doing nothing in hopes of achieving something. Not buying a product is, largely, invisible. If you wish to effect change, even a return to the status quo, you must take some kind of action. Boycotts have a long tradition in the consumer-business relations world, and the most successful ones were NOT those that were quiet."
valve,33tfkr,Bogromor,2,Sun Apr 26 10:22:03 2015 UTC,I would argue that those boycotts and protests at least didn't make the environment toxic for everyone else.   People picketing in front of a company building is not spamming a mod creator's page with hate.  Plus there are plenty of people who are pro choice in letting mod creators decide to charge for mods or not. The people against this in what appears to be a large majority are going to continue raiding to get their way over everyone else.
valve,33tfkr,spatulaboy,7,Sat Apr 25 23:59:06 2015 UTC,"The reason ""don't buy it"" is not an acceptable answer is twofold:     Many people WILL buy it, because there a lot of stupid people. If many people buy it, it will show Valve that the stratagem is successful, and they will be encouraged to continue, or even expand the program."
valve,33tfkr,ProfessorStupidCool,7,Sun Apr 26 08:53:06 2015 UTC,"So many people are willing to buy mods or will buy mods but the people who are against this are still going to force what they want on everyone else via raiding, spam, etc until the company caves.  Nice."

valve,33tfkr,ProfessorStupidCool,4,Sun Apr 26 01:01:38 2015 UTC,What I mean is it's sad that people are going to be belligerent until they get their way even when according to you many people will buy the mods.
valve,33tfkr,spatulaboy,-2,Sun Apr 26 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"I posit that the people buying the mods are being ripped off; taken advantage of.  Did you know that the mod authors get 25% in steam wallet?  You can't even cash that out. this is an error that I shouldn't have been perpetuating, apologies to anyone I've misled.  The cut is 25%, but it can be cashed out as real money.  The steam wallet thing applies to refunds, which I think is at least a little unfair, but not nearly as bad as I thought initially.  I do think this whole thing is scandalous still."
valve,33tfkr,ProfessorStupidCool,3,Sun Apr 26 01:32:11 2015 UTC,You sure about that Steam Wallet part?
valve,33tfkr,McGuirk808,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"Only as sure as I am about any of the stuff that hasn't been officially confirmed; it's word of mouth.  If I'm wrong that's fine, but I saw this complaint coming from someone who claimed to be attempting to make their mod salable, for what it's worth."
valve,33tfkr,ProfessorStupidCool,3,Sun Apr 26 01:56:39 2015 UTC,Refunds are sent to your steam wallet but sales are sent via Electronic Funds Transfer into the bank account of their choosing.   http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoppaymentinfofaq#Banking_Information  From what I understand the wallet thing is a rumor without a source that people are disseminating credulously.
valve,33tfkr,spatulaboy,3,Sun Apr 26 02:54:19 2015 UTC,Thank you for clarifying this.  I'm going to edit my post to reflect this.

valve,33tfkr,neoanguiano,6,Sun Apr 26 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"People don't like to pay for nice things that take a lot of work and effort to make, and they sure as hell don't like the people who spent years developing the tools required to make these things getting a cut of the pay.  They also sure as hell can't stand a company making money off of a product that it is selling.  In other words, look at it like this.  Valve is not taking a portion of the money, but instead, is buying each copy of the mod and selling it back to the community through their service at a higher price.  Gabe has already confirmed that there will be no exclusivity to the mods so it you want to buy them directly from the mod creators so they get the full profit, you are welcome to do so."
valve,33tfkr,Rodot,0,Sat Apr 25 14:35:23 2015 UTC,"People don't like to pay for nice things that take a lot of work and effort to make   I don't think it's so much this as it is, suddenly content that has previously always been free is now going to cost money.   If mods for games had started out being paid for content, there wouldn't be any of this kneejerk reactionary nonsense going on.  It's the old saw about the frog in the boiling pot of water, this is a sharp change that is causing a strong reaction.   What troubles me is no one is looking at the positive aspect of this. Valve allowing modders to now charge money for their work, means the quality of some of the work will increase. If people can make a living off of this or at least be compensated for their work and time, they might be more inclined to put in hours and effort on it that they would have otherwise spent doing other things had it just been a hobby that they distributed for free.   It may even spur people who are capable of modding to start doing so, that wouldn't have otherwise explored the idea, in hopes of eventually being able to make money off of their content."
valve,33tfkr,pipechap,0,Sun Apr 26 07:35:21 2015 UTC,"And ? That is still not Valves fault. If a modder who has been creating content for years now for free, feels like he wants that content to now be paid for, that has nothing to do with Valve. Valve just made the choice possible, people are complaining at Valve because they want free mods, not because they want the mod makers to get rewarded."

valve,33tfkr,pipechap,0,Sun Apr 26 04:54:39 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with it is that like the rest of the Steam store there will be 0 quality control. Putting a price tag on it doesn't mean that the quality would get better, more often that not it's the exact opposite effect and since mods have a tendency of conflicting with each other, a user could pay for say 10 mods and end up not being to play with them at the same time. I'm not against people making money of their hard work, but if they are making only a quarter of the money a user is paying it seems to me that the modders are being ripped off."
valve,33tfkr,00wolfer00,2,Sun Apr 26 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true. But even the owner of nexus agrees that quality control in this field is to difficult. The mods already get reviewed by valve and Bethesda before being available for purchase. There isn't much more they can do."
valve,33tfkr,Rodot,1 point,Sun Apr 26 07:42:37 2015 UTC,The modders only get a 25% cut and they get their money only if the mod sells 100eur   And people have their opionion on this it is mainly negative.

This is changing and with it comes all the filth that is making this capitalist world spin.  Aint no stopping this cancer trough the community. Who choose to make mods for free ? when you can earn dollars for it.  You be a thief of your own wallet. And so the exodus have started and soon the world of PC Gaming we endorsed for so long will never be the same.  I pulled away from Steam and went to GoG. Will never pay for a mod and i bet Piracy will increase in a high magnitude.  And who can blame them ? wich guy can buy a game for 60 euro and spend another 200 euro for mods and DLC ? For 1 game you get milked dry for contend that was free of charge you now get nikkel and dimed to death.  I wont ever support a modder on steam, but i have done donation trough paypall for mods to support their work if my wallet could miss it.  Now the money gets sucked in by studio's and Valve and the modders are clapping their hands for the leftovers Valve gives them.  Its sickening to see this happening before my eyes.

valve,33tfkr,ExecutiveChimp,22,Wed Apr 29 12:07:40 2015 UTC,"I think if it weren't executed so poorly it wouldn't have been as big a deal.   Railworks has been doing something like this for years (Community addons), it's just that there was moderation on what got approved for upload and what didn't. (so you couldn't steal someone's horse vagina mod, claim it as yours, and then sell it on the workshop for a hundred dollars) EDIT: Addons have to be approved before they can be sold for money, my mistake  There's also the issue that most people who play Skyrim also probably don't want to pay for mods, seeing as the game itself pretty much survives & sells copies exclusively because of the massive free modding community. Railworks' model worked out for them because if you like trains you really only have the one or two games to go to (especially if there's one specific model of train you like), but if you like RPGs then there's a whole lot of other games to fill that niche, many with large modding communities as well.  What I'm worried about, and I think most people are worried about, is if other games pick up this model. Cities:Skylines, ArmA 3, Garry's Mod would really turn into a mess if people started charging for gamemodes and addons. ACE is a fairly popular mod in ArmA and if it was locked behind a paywall I think it would be the end for a lot of communities in that game.  People are also worried that, given the option to conveniently charge users for mods, modders will get greedy and start trying to charge for mods that have been used by the community for years. People are worried that charging for mods to games will become the ""new normal"" so to speak.   tl;dr ""this is the beginning of the end PC GAMING IS DEAD AND IT'S ALL GABENS FAULT ARARARARAR""  I'm not too worried, it almost seems like there has been more backlash to this than there has ever been for any bill Congress has passed (in my lifetime anyway), so even given the option I don't think many developers are going to allow charging for workshop addons. We will see, though."

You say this, but the majority of the Day One outrage was not ""mod creators only get 25%?!"", it was ""CHARGING MONEY FOR MODS IS A MORAL EVIL, AND ANYONE WHO DOESN'T OPPOSE THE MONETISATION OF MODS IS A CANCER* ON GAMING"".  * Literally, somebody said this."
valve,33tfkr,tobascodagama,5,Sun Apr 26 03:28:48 2015 UTC,"Well, at least it seems like members of the fine communities of /r/gaming and the like are reacting calmly and certainly not reacting in an angered, knee-jerk manner, lol  In any case, outright charging for mods probably isn't right for major games like Skyrim. Donations have and probably will continue to work better than this system will. If Valve made the pay-what-you-want feature have an option of paying zero dollars, so it worked more as a donation option and less of a paywall, I think would hope the community wouldn't have reacted the way they did.  I'm curious to see if modders will find any sort of long term benefit to this instead of asking for donations. How many people actually will pay for premium mods vs. how many would rather donate to mods they like?"

valve,33tfkr,Pielikey,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"What's even funnier about this outcry over paid mods is NOBODY had a problem with people creating and submitting content for TF2 and having Valve/the community choose which gets put into the game, then the creators are paid a percentage of the profits.   It makes absolutely no sense that they would be more disgruntled with the content creators having more access and more freedom to post content rather than having to be chosen by the hand of Valve AND the community to showcase/sell their work."
valve,33tfkr,pipechap,2,Sun Apr 26 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"I remember there being some outcry about the TF2 store, a screenshot of an ingame fez costing more than an actual, real fez comes to mind.   Again, though, I don't think many are upset that Valve are enabling greed or something, I think they're more upset about what this could become. TF2 hats never made walled gardens, you could still join any server and stay in any TF2 community regardless if you spent hundreds on cosmetics or nothing at all.  If Trouble in Terror Town and all the other custom gamemodes become paid addons for Garry's Mod, then it could turn it into a microtransaction hell, which would be a shame because it would really make it tough to justify purchasing Garry's Mod (The stock sandbox can only be so entertaining for so long) and would probably drive a lot of people away from the game.   I agree that mod developers should be allowed to ask for compensation for their hard work, (They could theoretically do it all along) but making it so modders can either put value on their mods (is the minimum $.25?), or they cannot, seems like a bit of a negative way of going about it. Modders have been able to ask for donations forever, so making that more convenient for modders rather than making it more convenient to charge for it seems like it would have been a healthier idea than trying to capitalize the modding scene."

valve,33ux2n,DrakenZA,-2,Sun Apr 26 15:07:32 2015 UTC,Adding a payment system increases low effort high payoff content. In something like a close knit community of trust and genuine desire to perform it only exaggerates existing issues with human nature. Modding is something you do out of love for a game. If what you are doing is so intense that you need a revenue stream to compensate for your time then you are making a game not a mod and you should source funding appropriately. /u/haberdasherhero

And no one can speak for the MODders.  They are not a cohesive entity.  I can say however that I have never seen a community that exists without money changing hands survive the introduction of monetary payment (other than completely optional donations).  It will evolve into something very different and the old community dies as the new one evolves.    My problem personally is that I have been part of it for 20 years, I love it, all us jackass gamers, MODders, skinners, mappers, bastards, and whiners doing something we love just to sate our collective desire for fun and novelty are my people and I hate to see even a piece of something I hold so dear fade away..."

Im sure tons of mod makers work out of fun and passion, but that doesnt change the fact they would love money for their time and work.  You are not forced to make your mod a pay mod, hence all Valve is doing is giving the mod makers a CHOICE. If they pick they want to make money from their work, then clearly the are not agaisnt this system.  No real mod maker who has made decent content would be against this, the only people who hate this whole idea are the people who enjoyed getting free content, which isn't insane or anything, free content is the best.

All I am doing is making the observation that once you throw mandatory payments into a community you kill that fucking community.

If user is knowingly purchasing a broken product, that's pretty much beyond any help and I don't really want to touch that brand of stupidity."

What the video is arguing for is that extra bonus incentives don't work very well for creative work, not that you shouldn't pay people at all. Also it says that extra pay does work for  mechanic work, something you have to do quite a lot of when you want to move a product from rough proof of concept to polished product for the end user."

On face value that does seem unfair.  These are excerpts from  http://nerdist.com/nerdist-podcast-gabe-newell-valve-the-games/  starting about 11:30.  Paraphrasing a bit.

Yes, they are the host of the engine, most of the assets and the workshop platform but come on... Also, content creators get their money only above a certain threshhold.

If a free mod breaks they can have weeks to fix and wouldn't care. If I paid for something I expect it to work.   Modding is an ecosystem as well. Using other peoples animations, textures, models to make your mod better. BUT when you start making money..? You can't as it's breaking copyright. So instead of a helpful, friendly community, it's now a business practice, with lawsuits, DMCA take downs, and people just doing it for the money, instead of loving what they do.  Piggybacking off of someone elses work also shouldn't be a career. Donations, sure. But providing a service and having to pay while just editing the game? Nah. It will also be the death of modding as well. If this becomes the norm, things will be taken down off of free outlets, put up on workshop  and become paid. No more free ENB mods or texture packs.

valve,33qlh3,mad-lab,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"Because people have long believed that mods should be free. They always have been. The upside is that it can provide artists and programmers with a bit more income for their hard work. On the other hand, it will essentially restrict access to content, and nobody likes paywalls. Valve also takes a pretty big cut of the profit. I'm not sure where I stand on this issue yet."
valve,33qlh3,Confliction,2,Sat Apr 25 17:33:41 2015 UTC,I think the restriction of 400$ will probably help a lot. That can stop the poorly monetized mods from taking off. Vote with your wallet.
valve,33qlh3,delorean225,2,Sat Apr 25 00:30:41 2015 UTC,"Valve also takes a pretty big cut of the profit.   That's pure speculation. All we know is that the modder gets 25%. How much Valve gets at the end is unknown.   They split the remaining 75% with the IP holders (e.g. Bethesda) and other partners. If the IP holders are getting 50% (and the DayZ creator believes a figure like that is likely), and if Valve is giving service providers 5% (which was confirmed by the creator of Nexus ), then Valve may actually be taking less than the modders themselves.

There will still be people who will make mods for free because it's their hobby, there will be shills trying to sell shitty ""mods"" or other peoples work (which is a problem) and there will be new modders who will come because they will see a possibility of profit.   that being said, I don't think valve did very good about this because,if nothing else, workshop is crap, it's not a proper mod manager, it just installs the mod but doesn't keep track of what files it added/modified etc... also there should be some review process before a paid mod is added..."
valve,33qlh3,The_Potato_God99,2,Fri Apr 24 22:59:35 2015 UTC,"Unfair to the content creators, as they get mere 25% of the price. Not only that, but Valve will pay you only when you have amassed 100$ (which is 400$ in sales). That may not be an issue for bigger, popular mods, but it would be for all niche mods that only a few people use. Those are reasons why I believe it's unfair.  Now if you watched at least one of the videos you know about many of the other issues and you listed some yourself - workshop is crap. This locks you to use Workshop, since you still can't sell it anywhere else. The refund policy is very poor - suddeenly you become a paying customer and (at least under EU law) you are entitled to a working product for two years after you buy it. Valve just says ""go complain to the mod author, there is no refund after the initial 24 hours"". That's illegal and really shitty considering they (and the publisher) are who takes most money - one would think that they could at least offer some CS or something for that money.  It also damages the modding community that has brought tons of money into Valve's and bethesda's pockets. The community that made awesome stuff for free will now possibly have more issues with copyright as they will be watched much more. There will be people who toss garbage at Workshop for some easy money. There are already people stealing free mods from Nexus and putting them on Workshop.  So yeah. The idea that ""people should get money for their work"" is nice. But I doubt that's even what Valve had in mind when they made this, oh no. Their idea was that ""oh let's make us some money for no work, the infrastructure is in place already"". And the implementation reflects that."

Valve gains nothing but people's money from it (an unfair percentage to boot), the goal is to make money. Money that isn't put back into their titles. (See bug list for CSGO, Dota2, TF2) It's a clear money grab and this man is constructing his ""PR"" comments to make it sound otherwise. Thankfully not everyone is falling for it.  Look through Newell's comment history- You'll see something I'm sure you've never seen before: A bunch of comments downvoted to the -100's. It's wild stuff man.

I'm not forgetting man, I understand the idea of bandwidth costs and advertising costs etc, But why is valve choosing to face these costs if it's not even necessary?  I can tell you why I think they are, because they know that their Steam platform acts as a huge monopoly on the gaming market, and the numbers don't lie in terms of sales on steam vs origin, or vs GOG or vs Amazon DD or any other platform. They certainly have their grip and are making heavy amounts of money through it- This will be the case for the mod-market due to how steam's history has unfolded.  My biggest problem that I've mentioned here and there is that the money isn't being used for anything (Although now I can see that it's being used to make more money through different means)- Valve releases in the past 5ish years are all buggy, CSGO is practically a beta game- TF2 has terrible FPS due to it being bogged down by all the cosmetics and the list goes on. Counter strike servers are all running at half capacity @ 64tick with terrible hit registration- and the hitbox issues haven't been fixed since release. I would go into it, but it's all conveniently listed on /r/globaloffensive, just search bug-list and see for yourself if you wish.

valve,33usj2,DrakenZA,1 point,Sun Apr 26 14:46:55 2015 UTC,"Valve doesnt make the big %, the game dev does.   I never said otherwise but any percentage is too big to go to valve. They didn't do anything but provide an infrastructure to give themselves money. It's unnecessary and the ""mod-market"" has been working fine without it for years. It's an obvious attempt at monopolizing the market. The question you have to ask yourself is ""Do I like having monopolies in my hobbies"" and if you answer yes, than that's something you can live with and don't have to disagree with people who don't want monopolies, especially in such an offensive way. I've mentioned already- If the money was going to good use, then a lot more people would be behind this.   You telling me you really think modders didnt want to make some money from their work ?   Again, I didn't say that- Why are you choosing to fix my posts to suit your (unnecessary) arguments? Of course anyone may want to make money from something they made, but in this instance, they aren't making 75% of that money and they don't see any of it unless it sells over $100. By having your own website or ModDB page or whatever with a paypal donation link, not everyone might donate, but at least when they do you are getting what you deserve and a portion of it isn't being taken away from you for no reason by whoever.    Valve is serving up gbs and gbs of content via mods, its amazing how people today have complete lack of knowledge of how bandwidth and its costs work.   You're looking at it (And everything else really) with such a narrow point of view. Valve chose to do this and to pay for the bandwidth and are making everything costly for themselves, they can just NOT do this, save their money on their internet costs and let everyone go about their REGULAR mod distribution ways which have been working for decades. But they know that the internet costs are going to be covered by people purchasing things on steam from games, to mods, to stupid cases and keys- so due to the money they've already taken from people and not used for anything else- they have a huge reserve of somewhat disposable income to put towards things that might fail, but if it succeeds, it's just more and more money.  Drop the attitude if you're going to try and have a discussion with people, because I don't have to waste my time explaining things to somebody who is only looking for a flame-war."
valve,33usj2,TopazRoom,0,Sun Apr 26 18:47:12 2015 UTC,"Like i said, the mod creators are picking to sell their mods, they accept the idea that the people who created the base game get most of the money, they made the base game in the end.  You should be upset at mod makers, not Valve. Yes Valve 'enabled' them, but they made the choice.  Take your own advice my friend."
valve,33usj2,DrakenZA,-2,Sun Apr 26 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"if its such a bad deal then you still shouldn't blame valve, but the gaming company's who accept and use this option.  and everything outside of that like with dota 2 and csgo is not a reason to blame valve for the fact that they presented the option to the developer's."
valve,33usj2,TopazRoom,3,Sat Apr 25 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"By the gaming company's you mean guys who develop the mods and put them on steam?  If so, think of it like this- Who is going to go searching for mods through google and other means now if it's easier to just go to steam's mod workshop section and get what they want there? The casual gamer isn't going to go out of their way to do anything, By providing the ease of access, valve is essentially undercutting (for a lack of a better word) people who don't want to give up 75% of their profits. They are trying to start up a monopoly which is never good for the consumer.  The fact that I mentioned other games very closely relates to this though, I mentioned the money they spent isn't going towards bettering things for their customers.  It's that feeling of being used.  Hopefully this can give some perspective on how I and many other feel."
valve,33usj2,TopazRoom,2,Sat Apr 25 22:45:09 2015 UTC,no i mean the developer of the actually game. because the people who made the game for people to mod on have the option to use this or not to.

Seems like nobody wants to take the blame.  I tend to believe that this was Valve's idea to begin with, I'm familiar with how they do business within their releases (Updates being lackluster in terms of game fixes, but having no shortage of 'Pay-to-Use' profit generators, It's thin, but it's not like it doesn't make sense)  Even still. Valve is still letting it happen. Check out that thread that I linked above and you'll see what people's concerns are and Newell's replies. It's also a good guide as to ""Why?"" in general."

valve,33pb6y,brentwallac,39,Fri Apr 24 12:01:47 2015 UTC,"I used to work on mods (Deathmatch Classic: Source, Operation Lambda, Operation Black Mesa, Guard Duty) and at first I thought it's a fantastic idea, the team getting paid for the work, or at least getting enough money to cover for website hosting.    But honestly, this should stay as a ""pay as you want with NO MINIMUM"" thing, in other words, donations. And people are more likely to donate if you say it's ""pay what you want"" rather than having a large button that says ""DOWNLOAD HERE"" with a small ""donate"" button somewhere on the side.  During my time working in these mod teams, it was clear we all worked on the mods out of passion for the projects, but most importantly, to build our personal portfolios. We were all perfectly aware that we weren't going to earn money from making any of it and I think that's the way it should stay, donations welcome. One very important thing for modders is to get their work seen by as many people as possible. Putting your passion project portfolios behind a paywall is a dumb idea.  So in conclusion, to mod-creators, mods are a way to gain valuable experience and build portfolios, not to earn money. That is how it should stay."
valve,33pb6y,Henry132,5,Fri Apr 24 13:00:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Look how Ubuntu does their donation system. Valve, take a leaf out of Ubuntu's book.

Because the latter isn't pay what you want, that's just ""pay X or more"".  Granted, there will always be some practical minimum due to technical reasons and transaction fees, but for example donating from Steam wallet should be fine from 0.01$ upwards, not hundred times that or even more."

That was 3 years ago.  I think this mod would've likely had faster release schedule if there was some method to monetize all the effort that goes into such large mod. As it stands now, the half of the game we got was because of volunteer effort spanning almost full decade. Very unlikely that such projects are attempted again"
valve,33pb6y,KapteeniJ,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:39:21 2015 UTC,"Except just about a week ago they showed off their multiplayer part of the game on a livestream.  And they wouldn't have been able to monetize it until they released it, meaning they wouldn't have magically had more time on the side from their day jobs to work on the mod. Even if they could monetize it before release, they still wouldn't have made nearly enough money to quit their day jobs to work on the mod. So no, monetization definitely would not have sped up Black Mesa development."
valve,33pb6y,Henry132,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:05:36 2015 UTC,I think he is talking about an early access mod that you buy into ... because that is such a great idea with full blown games.

valve,33pb6y,IntergalacticTowel,9,Fri Apr 24 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"I've only made a handful of small QoL mods -- definitely not the sorts of things worth monetizing -- but I think this is a very bold move in the right direction. They definitely need to allow pay-what-you-want/donations in addition to their current system, but this can only be good for games even if it doesn't seem like it at first.  We're going to see more people move into modding if it becomes a profitable source of revenue (and once Valve lets us withdraw money from our wallets, obviously). We're going to see companies more willing to develop good modding tools (the 75% cut doesn't all go to Valve -- I'd be willing to bet up to 40% is going to the publisher).  The concerns that ""minor"" resolution fixing mods and etc., won't be free anymore are pretty ridiculous -- even if someone tries to sell a mod like that, I'm sure someone else will develop and release a free version. But more importantly, the sorts of games that need mods to fix their resolution limits aren't going to have workshop support.  The biggest one though is really the additional appeal from a publisher's point of view. Presently, developing a suite of modding tools for your game is risky. You're basically banking on the fact that a few devoted fans will create enough additional value for your game to justify devoting the team members to develop and support the modding tools, and that the additional value those fans create will directly move more copies. This happens. Look at Crusader Kings 2 and the Game of Thrones mod. I know several people who weren't interested in CK2 but bought it because of that mod. However, this is pretty rare. For the most part, modding tools are one of those features that makes your existing customers feel good about their purchase. It doesn't drive sales directly. The majority of your players will never interact with the modding scene.  If mods can offer developers/publishers an additional revenue stream, then suddenly, developing good modding tools and making your game easily moddable will pay immense dividends. This could be the first step toward a system like Dota 2's workshop, except applicable to many more games.  I think the backlash is ridiculous, honestly. People need to calm down and see where Valve is steering the ship first before jumping overboard just because of change."
valve,33pb6y,Malarious,8,Fri Apr 24 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"If it encourages the development of more polished, premium-quality content, then yeah, I'd love a system like what CS:GO or Dota has in my singleplayer games. To use an example, I've bought every cosmetic content pack for Crusader Kings 2 because I think they add a lot of flavor to the game. It's content that the devs worked on after the game was released so I don't see any issue with paying for it.  Valve's move is never going to kill off modding in general. If people don't buy paid mods, then modders won't charge for them. In the absolute worst case scenario I don't see any way the situation could become worse than what we have now. There are issues with Valve's implementation, there are hurdles that must be overcome, but I don't believe the fundamental idea is harmful to the modding community.  Regarding broken mods and such, there are games that are sold in stores with game-breaking bugs. I don't see how this is any different. As consumers, we should investigate the product before we buy it and see what others have to say about it. If the bug is noted and the modder pushes a fix a couple of days later (which he'll now have a financial incentive to do so) then I'm actually happier than if he'd released the mod for free but never fixed it.  It's absolutely not a monopoly. It's a competing service. There are already modding sites out there for The Sims that you need to pay for. This isn't even new territory -- it's just the first time a large company has really tried to push something like it on consumers.  Modders who truly make mods as a hobby won't charge. They aren't obligated to. There is nothing in the new terms that prevents people from uploading free mods. Again, all this is going to do is provide incentive for modders to work harder and make better things. It might even elevate modding from a hobby to a viable job path. Right now, modding is akin to an unpaid internship, just slightly more rewarding. What's wrong with letting modders charge for their work, if they so choose?"

A game has a AAA company behind it and a support phone number that you can call.  Mods have 1 guy maybe 2 - 3 and you post on the forums and pray to god that they fix it for you.   It's absolutely not a monopoly. It's a competing service.   Tell me 1 other place that you can SELL mods on? None only Steam. They absolutely have a monopoly on this.

If they had a monopoly, they'd be the ones making the mods for games, and be the only benefactor for one, for two it will not remain that way for very long at all.  Monopoly: the exclusive possession or control of the supply or trade in a commodity or service.  What they supply is the PLATFORM to host the mods with the OPTION to charge a price. Lets look at it in the terms of an actual real life situation.  Lets say Walmart(Steam) was the only available store where you could sell... I don't know, pens(Mods). And the pens were selling, well suddenly Target(EA/Origin), Office Depot(Uplay), and other stores(Maybe Nexus?) want to be able to get in on that. So they clear out some area, put some money into it, and construct(Develop) a section(Platform) to sell pens at, and open the gates for the supplier of pens(Modders) to place their product and sell, with the option to charge how much they want, so long as they give 30%(Valve's rate for their market) to the owner of the platform. It's no longer a 'monopoly', (but I'm obviously leaving out the big boys who created the original pens, something that doesn't really apply to the idea of it being a monopoly)"

valve,33pb6y,ReiBob,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"I've been modding games since BG2.  Most of my stuff has always been small ""fix this stupid thing"" but I have worked on bigger stuff.  My thoughts are that paid mods done right would be excellent.  Something like 95% of good mods have to give up half way.     The 25% payoff is just way too weak.  Obviously Steam/Bethesda get a portion but anything less than 40% to the modder is outright robbery.  Just letting anyone charge for a mod is madness.  They need some curation and a system for modders to catch the obvious content thievery.   What really irks me is a lot of the complaining is just a bunch of entitled douchebags expecting this stuff to remain free.  It's just insulting to people who put in all the work."

valve,33pb6y,prolim123,-1,Sat Apr 25 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i think paying for mods are too far. Donations are otherwise, acceptable and completely fine imo."
valve,33pb6y,dorn3,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:16:05 2015 UTC,You already paid for a mod.  Skyrim is essentially a mod of the Oblivion engine.  Oblivion was a mod of Morrowind.  Any expansion you've ever bought was a mod.  Etc etc etc.  You're complaint is devoid of any logic and is the product of your own selfishness.
valve,33pb6y,LC0728,0,Sun Apr 26 13:39:21 2015 UTC,"Donations are otherwise, acceptable and completely fine imo.   The issue with that is that it's basically optional, and not everybody is willing to 'donate'. Something about the word throws them off.  A better way to do it would be a 'pay what you want' option, with a maximum set price for modders. Say cap it at 2 dollars, then the modder gets to decide 'do I want to charge, or do I want to make it free from the get go'. From there, you can decide if you want to pay right away, or donate afterwards."

Steam doesn't even have a real steam support .. they are full of $$ and can't hire a few people to just help people ?  I would rather make my mods free than to give valve 75% for my work ."
valve,33pb6y,Wasabicannon,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"Just wondering if Valve was to do this 75% thing for L4D2 and CSGo mods would you be ok with this?  I fully understand the issue with Skyrim mods however with L4D2 and CSGo valve made/published these titles and created the modding tools that you use for them. I may be missing something, not sure if you modders use tools outside of the ones provided by the devs."
valve,33pb6y,stiflercosmin,-1,Sat Apr 25 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"I would not be ok at all w that ,because the tools they have are so outdated and so broken that I had to find solutions online and when I contacted steam support they said that they can't help me w anything ..  I worked 8 months on a Left 4 Dead 2 map that has 37.000 downloads , I consumed my own resources like electricity and time and never got back any cent ...   I just felt good that 40.000 people are enjoying something I made . Yes I would like to get some $$ from that , but I would feel used if I took only 25% and steam 75% for not even helping me solve problems that they made .

The issue is that the shittiness of the company has no bearing on profits in the video game industry, so there is no incentive for them to be the 'good guys' anymore. They will make fuck tons off of this and the modding community will be ruined for good."
valve,33u1hk,samw3d,1 point,Sat Apr 25 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"I've yet to hear a compelling argument for why this will ruin anything.    I jailbreak my iPhone, which gives me access to Cydia, which gives me access to tons of tweaks, both paid and free.  Some of the best tweaks are free.  Some of the best tweaks are paid.  The idea that some are free and some are paid has not ruined the jailbreaking community.  Those who mod for a passion still release their stuff for free, and while I won't accuse those who charge a (usually small) fee for their mods as being passionless, it's fine by me if they think their mod is worth a couple of bucks."
valve,33u1hk,ThrowingChicken,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"Commercialization of an otherwise completely non-commercial creative sector/practice will have a LOT of effects. I'm not sure if your argument is that nothing will happen, or something - in the case of something, whether or not the mod community will be 'ruined' is hard to define and a little subjective. But changes will absolutely happen.  My biggest fear is that the ratio of quality mod content to total shit will be completely reversed. The stench of money will bring in content creators/opportunists that have no spiritual interest in what they're doing. The amazing thing about the mod community was that every single piece of content was fueled by a love/knowledge of the existing content and the desire to express oneself creatively without thinking about material benefit. The saturation of fucknuggetry on the App Store, for example. That is definitely what we could be seeing with this change.  There are the obvious (and already obvserved) issues of content stealing, failure of technical support and failure of quality assurance in things that are not officially supported products.   Ultimately, the spirit of modding is to have fucking fun in being creative and expressive on top of existing content. The commercialization of this, particularly with the structure that is currently at play with Skyrim, betrays and infects that and makes it a FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. That is just wrong to me and, yes, it ruins the whole space."
valve,33u1hk,samw3d,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"While I appreciate the passion, I find your view of the modding community to be a bit idealistic, and perhaps a bit rose-tinted.  As a creator myself, I would never argue against ""spiritual interest"" in a project, but I recognize that spiritual interest is not always enough to deliver a good product.  It doesn't matter the IP/fandom/medium, there is plenty of bad fan art out there (I've probably made some of it), and it certainly, always, despite spiritual interest, outweighs the good.  But you don't really notice it because the cream always rises.  Admittedly I am not specifically familiar with the Skyrim modding community, but as someone who could not get enough Half-Life/HL2, and Portal back in their heyday; I know just how many terrible, worthless mods are out there.  For every GMod, CS, CM, and Prelude, there are hundreds of unplayable, incomprehensible, worthless mods.  These terrible mods are already here, and adding a dollar sign to them isn't going to make them anymore popular.     The amazing thing about the mod community was that every single piece of content was fueled by a love/knowledge of the existing content and the desire to express oneself creatively without thinking about material benefit.   Based on what some modders are saying, even those who are against paid mods, I'm not sure this is entirely true.  While they did not expect the end product to directly result in a windfall, many of them have stated they were using it for self promotion.  In that case they are getting something of value beyond self-satisfaction, where eventually they hoped their work would indirectly result in a measurable gain, including monetary.   I think offering a monetary incentive not only has potential to attract talent, it potentially offers incentive to keep those who are both spiritually interested and talented on track.  Yes, it will attract untalented con artist too, but as I said, the cream will rise, paid or not.  Additionally, I think a lot of this hate is from people scared of what the modding community will do to itself.  If the modding community is about all the things you and others say it is about, then you shouldn't be so concerned about Valve giving them options."
valve,33u1hk,ThrowingChicken,-1,Sun Apr 26 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"""ruin the modding community"" by that you mean actually having to download your mods and put it in a folder instead of pressing a button. Just like the old days."

As it stands at the moment, barely anyone is prepared to pay for mods. The sales aren't going to be high at all. Even games companies disagree with the system(I seem to recall hearing that C:S put something in their EULA about not being able to charge for mods without their permission)."

EDIT: To the people who think I'm overreacting, check this out.   Q. What happens if a mod I bought breaks?  A. Sometimes one mod may modify the same files as another mod, or a particular combination of mods may cause unexpected outcomes. If you find that mod has broken or is behaving unexpectedly, it is best to post politely on the Workshop item's page and let the mod author know the details of what you are seeing.   Notice that nowhere does it say that the author of the mod I paid for is obliged to fix it. What happens if an official patch with a lot of bug fixes comes to a game and makes it playable (not an hypothetical situation, happened with Total War Rome II, one of my favorite games; it was unplayable for a lot of time and it would have continued to be so if it wasn't for mods) but it breaks the mod, and the modder decides not to update the mod? Do I have to choose between playing a broken game or not being able to play for content I paid for? No thanks. Torrents, here I come.  Also, notice that they are also telling me ""fuck you"", just more ""politely""."

This introduces a few problems off the top of my head:   The first being not really related to skyrim specifically as the game is pretty old now, if an update breaks a mod and the developer decides not to update it then it will be the consumer being shafted.  Secondly, If two mods conflict with each other then what?

Buyer beware doesn't mean don't buy. It means buy if you want, but knowing there will be risks. That's why /u/brekus's point still applies. He correctly pointed out that risks that were identified exists in other similar transactions.    All I'm say is that I don't see how ""Buyers beware"" being our only protection against unforeseen risks in products is acceptable, if you can get 1 year guarantee, 30 days free return as a way to lessen the risks with many physical products I don't see why we can't get it in the digital world.   Because the items that have those protections aren't really comparable. When you buy a toaster, there isn't a billion different compatibility issues that can occur. Nor can you ""finish"" all the content of a toaster like you can finish the story in a mod.   If you look at comparable items, you'll see they don't have those protections. Take for example, physical video games. In general, you cannot get a full-refund on a video-game that has been opened.

valve,33mstr,mad-lab,-1,Sat Apr 25 05:19:30 2015 UTC,Cannot believe you've been downvoted for this! It seems obvious that paid for mods should encourage independent modders to continue their wonderful work. No-one is forcing the community to purchase mods after all.
valve,33mstr,Stepepper,7,Fri Apr 24 01:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, this will indeed encourage modders to work. In fact, it will bring even more modders! What a great time to live in! Actually, wait, no. Shit modders will come. We'll have SHIT just like in the Google Play Store and the iOS Play Store, but even MORE than that. Because we don't even have to pay to put your mod online. Instead of 'sword packs' that look pretty cool we'll now have individual swords, cosmetic items, horse armour, new characters that all look SHIT and you have to pay like 99 cent for it. That is what will happen. The modders may earn some bucks, but less people will play what they have made. They're more likely to earn more money with a donate button. Which would be wonderful if steam has that! Something like itch.io would be brilliant, a pay what you want mechanic that has a 'suggested price' for like 5 dollars. But also a ""don't pay!"" button. This allows people to play the mods for free, but the chance of them getting money is a lot higher since they don't have to put a paypal link in the description, that people will just skim over and probably don't look back unto if the mod is actually worth paying money for. If it's actually good, they can go right back the the mod, press the 'donate' button that may be on the page and select a payment method, and pay an amount you want to of at least $1. This would be the best mechanic of letting modders earn money. Valve is just ruining this.  If it ain't broken, don't fix it."

Not only will their creations be rated poorly (and thus be difficult to find and unattractive), but they will not get any money until they reach a threshold of 400 dollars. The shittier the mod you create, the less likely it is you will meet that threshold, let alone exceed it so much that it becomes worth it.  This will also attract more serious and talented modders who will create mods that are highly rated, and will make existing modders more likely to update their older work.

A lack of a 'paid' option can be limiting to creators who want to create very large-scale, ambitious mods -- it is just too much time and effort to put in to a free work.

It seems to me that Valve is taking a rather fair share (esp considering they handle the entire backend of the project), but is forced to shaft the modders due to things out of it's control.  edit: Lets not forget that nobody is forced to use this service.

But I still need something to relax to and I find gaming is that thing I try to save money and I generally do but the problem for most people with this current situation is valve trying to monetize a free service now I'm not saying modders shouldn't be supported but they are and hell even when I've saved up a bit of cash I donate money so people like them can make some money from their effort. We're pissed that valve is potentially going to take our favorite mods and mod developers to steam where they'll only sell their mods no longer offering free content which has always been one of the biggest perks of PC gaming and its community. If the developers want money it would be better to just ask for donations to help continue mod updates instead of monetizing one of the best parts of PC gaming.

As in, made by Valve and not by the community. Some of them were, such as Chesko's Arissa, but some of them just don't make sense.  I saw one in particular that gave you Freeman's crowbar after completing a short quest in-game. The bottom of the page said the crowbar was licensed from Valve...but I'm having a hard time buying that. Why would Valve license independent usage of just one of their assets?   Who would I contact to license the use of just the Heavy's sandvich from TF2? And for a fifty-cent mod?? Seems like way too much trouble for way too little gain...unless you're Valve and you already own the license and you're just capitalizing on it by spreading your IP to 3rd-party titles.  So one the one hand, I guess it's kinda cool if Valve is making mods, but on the other it kind of seems like a cheap cash-grab and not an investment in the community."

Say I create something that has many different assets and release all of them for use under a licence. If you then end up using only one of those assets, you would still have to say ""X asset was licensed from /u/mad-lab"" or something to that effect. That doesn't mean you literally contacted me and we negotiated for a licence of  that single asset...  If I download an open-source software and use of its scripts in my software, I have to say script A was taken from XYZ package distributed under XX license, even though I didn't have to contact the creators for anything, let alone negotiate a license for that specific thing."
valve,33mstr,Uber_naut,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, I didn't think about that. I made an assumption that a very small number of assets were licensed based on the (extremely) small size of the mod."

valve,33mstr,Uber_naut,-1,Fri Apr 24 16:34:08 2015 UTC,"This...  This is horrifyingly bad.  As someone who cant play skyrim without having it modded to shit, this just breaks everything.  Lets say i have to pay 1 dollar for each mod, i usually want to play with 100-200 mods. THATS SOMETHING BETWEEN 100 AND 200 DOLLARS, AND THATS NOT EVEN INCLUDING THE MODS THAT WILL GO FOR MORE THEN 1 DOLLAR.  And what if a mod conflicts? Yes there is the refund option but that wont do anything because game breaking glitches usually happend late game after you have spent atleast 48 hours on the game. Then you just have to kindly ask the modder if you can get your money back or if he can make a comptability patch.  This system just shafts everyone. Modders get 25% of the total income, the rest goes into Valves pocket, and the modders only start getting income from the mod when is has accumulated 400 dollars of sales. The hardcore fans will have to pan insane ammounts of money to get the absolute experience. And the people with low tier computers will have to buy optimisation mods to make skyrim run at a good fps. the only ones that dong get shafted by this system is those who just play vanilla."
valve,33mstr,Vash63,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"Basically everything you just said is nonsense.   Many of the things were free before will remain free. VALVE is just providing a tool for people to sell their creations so should they please. $1 a mod is extremely reasonable. Installing 200 mods on a single game is ludicrous. If a mod conflicts with another mod then you can remove one and keep the other. If you think it's unreasonable you can get a refund or voice your concern on community workshop. This is given that it undergoes prior quality control. The system ""shafts"" nobody, it only provides a slight inconvenience to the people who downloaded mods for free and gave nothing back to the people who created the content."
valve,33mstr,diemockingbirddie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"1: I dont think its gonna turn out that way. First modders are gonna upload the old version or a brand new version to the workshop and then delete the file from the nexus and other sites that have that file so the only way to get it would be to buy it. This may or may not happen, we will just have to wait and see.  2: Yes but it depends on what mod. If its one dollar for an incredebly small mod (Lets say a new sword mod) then no, no money. But if it is a huge mod, then hell yes 5-10 dollar price tag is a good thing.  3: In your opinion, yes. But i love my game modded to shit, so i can sink the maximum time into the game before i have to start a new save with a new build and do it all over again.  4: Removing one and keeping the other destroys the purpose of modding, modding is about adding things in to make it more interesting and fun, having to pick and chose is not a good thing. And as i said im my post ""Yes there is the refund option but that wont do anything because game breaking glitches usually happend late game after you have spent atleast 48 hours on the game."" You can only refund within 24 hours and if you want to still get your money back then you have to ask the modder to give your money back.  5: This does shaft the consumers who DON'T have bucket loads of money on them at all times, and i suspect that group is a majority."

If they want to put more work into their mod under the condition of making money for their work, how is that a bad thing? Then either don't use the sword mod or make your own if you don't think their effort is worth their price tag. Not a hard concept. Cool, and if the authors of those mods you love so much want payment for their work that's their prerogative. If they aren't providing a worthy value find someone who is. Fair enough, but this is a Skyrim problem, not a Valve one. They don't have a system in place to prevent or deal with such conflicts well. Again, you have no right to get other people's work for free. NONE. Zero. If the person who spent the time to make the content wants money for it, that is THEIR right. You can respond by simply not purchasing it."

Mods work like this already. The only difference is that now you have the option to pay for them. The mods (like the workshop items) undergo a screening process, it's not a completely open-market. If anything this will provide far more quality control.    That this is a step in the direction of ubiquitously hated freemium style gaming bull shit?    That's not what freemium means. Freemium style gameplay is not inherently bad, it's just typically associated with the likes of companies like Zynga that design their business model around exploiting impulse buys.

It's because your bills are probably paid by your parents while mod developers sacrifice hours of their free time (aka the time they don't get paid for) to make new content for you (so you can have fun in your free time which is probably all of your time) without getting anything in return besides a pat on the back."

This is not necessarily a bad thing.

I'm unsure about the simulations community, but at least in the case of Skyrim, mods have been made that stand on par/outclass paid content. Specifically, Falskaar is arguably on par with an official DLC.

Would you allow anyone to start their business without paying you anything for the electricity/water/space/profit? If so, you'd go bankrupt the next month. The difference between Valve, and (for example) EA is this: Valve invests the money back into their platform and they're pushing the gaming industry forward. They made Steam from nothing (show me a single comparable platform), they made VR headset better than any other solution (Oculus is heavily funded by Facebook), they're trying to made the gaming possible elsewhere than on Windows platform by porting games, fixing the whole Linux platform, graphics drivers etc. What does EA do?

If they weren't involved I fully believe valve would keep their 25% or so, and give the rest to the modder.   Point 3: I'm willing to bet that the game devs such as Bethesda are preventing Valve from implementing a straight 1:1 donation option, since they see it as people profiting from their own creation. So the option is either what Valve currently implemented, or no system at all. Why aren't we blaming Bethesda for their part in this-- they are the ones who profit the most off of it!"

Edit: More specific from the steam FAQ:   Is there a limit on the number of transactions I can participate in in the Community Market?  Currently there is no limit on the number of transactions you can participate in. However, the United States Internal Revenue Service, under Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, if you are a U.S. citizen or resident, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, but you will not be able to list any items for sale in the Community Market once you meet the 200 sales threshold, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, while we are required to collect this information from you, we are not required to share this information with the IRS under Section 6050W unless you exceed $20,000 in gross sales in the Community Market within a single calendar year. For purposes of calculating the number of sales you have made in a calendar year, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account."

And the ""Advisors"" are mentioned in his backstory  too, some quantum physics for good measure and the multiverse. here are some quotes...  ""Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. ""  "" It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.""  ""Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us"""
valve,335pfc,SmearierWharf,14,Sun Apr 19 20:13:45 2015 UTC,Source 2 is really going to open 2 doors I think. 1. A cleaner platform for Valve to build and expand on current games with (making it easier for them to code on features - breaking the previous engines limitations) 2. Hopefully performance on lower end PC's
valve,335pfc,P373R1,6,Mon Apr 20 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"Source games run well on low end hardware. I really hope Valve continues that with Source 2. Unity, Frostbite, Unreal--those are all cool engines, but they simply don't compare to the optimization of Source."
valve,335pfc,MetroidAndZeldaFan,2,Mon Apr 20 05:49:27 2015 UTC,UE3 has fucking excellent optimization... I could run high settings with AA for UE3 games on my old gtx260
valve,335pfc,Akdag,5,Mon Apr 20 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"UE4, not so much. And they want to run VR on it. It is ~3x the needed shaded pixels per second compared to 1080p@60Hz (for HTC Vive, that is), so pretty much divide the perf of the UE4 demos by 3. I could probably hit this with Source engine games with ease, but UE4? Damn"
valve,335pfc,volca02,5,Mon Apr 20 18:41:57 2015 UTC,"optimization of Source.   Source is from 2003. It's not that greatly optimized, just old enough for everyone to be able to run it smoothly."

valve,335pfc,DDSloan96,1 point,Mon Apr 20 19:16:49 2015 UTC,And it was based on the even older Id engine. You think they're going to make Source 2 from scratch?

valve,335pfc,generalako,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah i am currently using this CPU  with Intel HD. I am amazed at how well source games run. Half Life 2 on High settings runs at a steady 60FPS majority of the time, and Portal 2 runs at a steady 60FPS on lower settings, but when i play Bioshock it is barely playable and I only get around 25FPS on minimum settings. Huge difference and just goes to show how much of a difference optimization can make."

valve,335pfc,tnethacker,7,Mon Apr 20 14:46:12 2015 UTC,"I think it is safe to assume HL3 is waiting for a revolution. The expectations are so high they need a shift in HW to be able to deliver. I don't mean performance, I mean VR, pretty much.  And I also really hope I am right."
valve,335pfc,volca02,2,Mon Apr 20 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'd say you are dead on right. VR is definitely going to be one part of the whole game, so they must be waiting for some of the toys to be developed for it."

If you and I had waited a year before getting laptops, we wouldn't have had as much trouble because the newer Intel chips come with more powerful graphics.  When stuff runs well, hooray for us, but expecting Valve to make everything run smoothly on our weak hardware is just a little unfair.  I think it's amazing that many Source games run as well as they do."
valve,335pfc,jonnywoh,5,Mon Apr 20 00:02:26 2015 UTC,We're spec buddies!  c:
valve,335pfc,StarHorder,5,Mon Apr 20 00:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think one issue with that logic is that people who can't or won't spend much on hardware probably won't spend much on games either.  Not that it wouldn't be nice, but it's probably not worth it to them.  If you're interested in getting a more powerful gaming machine on a budget, post on /r/buildapcforme with your budget and how you intend to use said gaming machine."

valve,335pfc,Ireallyhatethissite,9,Mon Apr 20 18:41:22 2015 UTC,Do you have time to talk about our lord and savior Linus Torvalds?  Source games run much better on Linux than on Windows.  Give it a try.
valve,335pfc,Rodot,6,Mon Apr 20 01:02:46 2015 UTC,Linux is the shit yo. It's just that more than half of my games are windows only. But when the last few parts for my desktop come in my laptop is going right back on linux.
valve,335pfc,Ireallyhatethissite,3,Mon Apr 20 01:27:25 2015 UTC,I just wish I could get these freaking drivers to work correctly.

valve,33442n,Sykarax,17,Sun Apr 19 09:57:44 2015 UTC,"Wait, the only thing they're basing this off of is a very blurry and skewed photo of the game package where there is no way to say who the character really is? This is the most speculative speculation you can get."
valve,33442n,Henry132,2,Sun Apr 19 15:19:25 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a classic lego minifig, one of the first, that is a guy in orange overalls? that seems a lot more likely than Chell. Especially with this game being a console multiplat, and as far as we know not coming to PC (if you didn't know, Valve has this thing about PC gaming...). Portal is also a far darker and more mature themed series than anything else they're talking about, or which is likely to appear (the superhero stuff of course varies wildly and at its darkest outdoes anything, not counting that). She's also not really a good character, literally an empty shell the Player slips into. Unlike Gordon Freeman even, canonically a mute."
valve,33442n,eugd,-46,Wed Apr 22 13:57:17 2015 UTC,"No offense, but who the fuck cares about legos? Other than 5 year old kids, that is."
valve,33442n,generalako,18,Sun Apr 19 12:08:34 2015 UTC,"If Valve is licencing out characters to another game studio, especially one as iconic as Chell, I couldn't care less whether that studio is Lego or a handful of god-damn sea monkeys, its HUGE news.  That said, I don't think it sits right with me, the other ""3rd party"" characters he lists are all licences that Lego has definitely already acquired (Doctor Who, Simpsons, etc). The Lego portal ""idea"" (that's all it is, a fan idea) has not been officially picked up by Lego. As far as anyone knows, Valve isn't licencing characters to anyone."

valve,31m490,Frorath,4,Mon Apr 6 10:20:30 2015 UTC,"OK boom. I originally laughed at your question, Marketing Communication at valve is like an oxymoron.    Im not going to explain it, but I watched this documentry like 1 and a half years ago, and I could never remeber where I heard it from, Valve don't have a marketing team, because valve cant trust the marketing team to say the right stuff.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=AGj1rtwKR9I#t=501  starting at 8:22, ive been looking for this Interview for fucking ages. glad I found it  Edit2: 19:20 also mentions they get staff involved in other random events  EDIT: to actually answer your question: The best part of valves communication is reading a patchnote that directly correlates to something youve seen the community discuss.   Worst part of valve communication is when you dont know when youre gunna get your next fix or update on the game you love, and it tends to compund complaints in the community, as everyone feels the same."
valve,31m490,P373R1,2,Mon Apr 6 11:36:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the answer! I haven't seen this interview yet and it is a great source for some quotes about how Valve feels towards the marketing and stuff. Thanks a lot!  Even though I understand their carefulness about making a marketing department and hiring new people, I find it to be a decision that is actually more hurting, than helping the company and the customers. The games and it's communities have already overgrown the +-300 team at Valve. If I could, I would recommend them to give it a shot and just try to hire new people, including marketing folk."
valve,31m490,eugd,3,Mon Apr 6 12:09:51 2015 UTC,"TFComics is the perfect case study of Valve. 'Bi-monthly' which after two weeks fans just had to assume meant every two months. turned out to be four months, at which time valve joked about the bi-monthly confusion. I forget the delay on the third issue, but at that time they joked about moving to annual releases. Now it's six months later...  In general Valve has no marketing communication. Or just plain no communication. They don't have a press team, and don't seem to have much in the way of any coordination. The paradox is that they manage to keep secrets fairly well. We'll never know."
valve,31m490,P373R1,2,Tue Apr 7 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"2 months down the track, is your thesis complete yet? I would be interested in reading it / the section about valve.   Otherwise how is your progress going?"

I would share it, but it is only in Slovak language, so it would not tell you much I guess . I just landed a pretty nice marketing job tho, in our local videogame developer company (mainly casual Facebook games) and this thesis might have helped with my CV, so it was worth the time, thats for sure. Thanks a lot for your interest and help with this thread! Have a good one."

valve,31m490,P373R1,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:29:36 2015 UTC,"Good point. I don't recall any either. They use this type of classic marketing only quite occasionally I would say. Their main ideology is that if they make good content (and invest in it instead of classic ad based marketing), the community will take care of the rest. And they do have a point. But maybe, with 1 billion+ annual revenue they have, they might consider doing both."
valve,31m490,misfitskater6,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:36:25 2015 UTC,"Their products that are outsourced (NEXON and Perfect World) they do heaps of advertisement for Dota around the times of the International for Dota2. NEXON (Korea) and Perfect World (China) are 3rd party distribtors of Dota2, because those regions do not allow US bodies to sell products in their countries (Please look into that one, as im not 100% sure) because of this factor, PW and Nexon are free to market however they like. Unlike SEA (dotA1 pretty much everywhere), I think Korea and China are heavily isolated from other MOBAs, or they have their own. so marketing is important there, BUT it is unknown if the marketing is overseen by valve or not.    But again, unlike the video I linked above, I dont have hard facts you can reference for this one. All I know is that in China around Ti4 there were billboards and busstops posted to reddit quoting ""Look what I saw on my trip"""

valve,30hup5,amauk,-1,Fri Mar 27 20:16:34 2015 UTC,I would personally not prefer this. Portal is a different type of game and is filled with sarcasm and humor. Half-Life is a more serious IP that has heart and charm.
valve,30hup5,generalako,19,Tue Mar 31 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you could successfully combine the two sets of game mechanics. The two don't match in my opinion, and if you try to join them you'd end up with something very disjointed.  Half-life is a very free-form game where you can pretty much go anywhere in a level. You're constrained by how far you can jump and how far you can fall without dying. The game also has projectile weapons, ladders, vehicles and mobile enemies.  In contrast, and because of the possibilities that portals create, the Portal games are actually quite constrained in where you can go, what you can do and what things are happening in a level. In the first game there's little restriction on where you can place portals, and as such the levels are basically self-contained boxes where you can do loads of insane things but it's all confined to a controlled environment. The second Portal game opens up the levels, but cracks down on portal placement. In each case, your journey through a level is very linear and controlled. You can't even jump over the railings on walkways in the portal games.  Combine the two? Gordon would either be constantly dying from falling from heights, or have the ability to fling himself from level start to level end. Place portal on floor and watch wave after wave of zombies / combine fall through it. Rockets / tripmine lasers through portals? What about driving through a portal.  I just don't think you can put a portal gun into Gordon's inventory and have the gameplay work properly."
valve,30hup5,AnthropomorphicPenis,8,Fri Mar 27 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"In contrast, and because of the possibilities that portals create, the Portal games are actually quite constrained in where you can go, what you can do and what things are happening in a level.   The guns themselves are constrained. The portal guns work on certain specialized surfaces for a reason."
valve,30hup5,TheOverNormalGamer,3,Fri Mar 27 17:04:29 2015 UTC,"Controlling each character alternatively? Just like they did with Kafei in Sakon's hideout in The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask.   If you haven't played it: Kafei had to solve a puzzle to unlock the next area, then Link had to kill the monsters to secure it, then Kafei had another puzzle to solve, then Link had more monsters to kill, etc. You controlled each character alternatively: as soon as Kafei solved the puzzle you controlled Link, as soon as Link killed the monsters you controlled Kafei. Well what if that's how Half-Portal is? With Chell as Kafei and Gordon as Link obviously.   Or, another theory: Same universe, but an all new character. Chell and Freeman only make small cameos. What if  the new protagonist was the G-Man? That would be exciting. Or GLaDOS ? Or both, as a team, kinda like JC Denton and the mysterious computer in Deus Ex?  So many possibilities."
valve,30hup5,Henry132,3,Fri Mar 27 15:58:46 2015 UTC,I admit that it is hard to imagine a combination. Maybe the Portal Gun is restricted to special areas or levels. Let's say that Gordon has to make a trip to the Aperture Science Complex. They could create a 4h part of the game with the Portal Gun for that.
valve,30hup5,scorch883,2,Fri Mar 27 16:00:15 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that if they went to aperture science, they wouldn't have the portal gun, or maybe find an ""experimental"" version or something like that that would only work for some of the game. If there is a crossover, it probably won't be all or most of the game anyway."
valve,30hup5,ProfessorStupidCool,3,Sun Mar 29 02:03:36 2015 UTC,"Not only would the combination of Portal and Half-Life not work, but Portal has its entire own fanbase that doesn't want anything to do with running around shooting zombies, a large part of the Portal fanbase even being little children. So it would even be a disservice to the fans, besides just being near impossible to logically implement."
valve,30hup5,fortredr,0,Fri Mar 27 17:45:57 2015 UTC,If they only want money yes. If they want Half life to be continued in an interesting manner then crossover. Maybe a crossover hl3 and something that takes place while you sleep before portal 2

No room in my house would be large enough to allow me to walk about and explore a level at a size we expect using Valve's Lighthouse. What would the solution be? An ugly clunky omni-treadmill thing? Just using WASD to move? I tried playing HL2 on Oculus Rift DK2. It was not enjoyable at all. Moving with WASD while actually just sitting in VR was a pain to me. It ruined my emersion, limited my spacial awareness (compared to snappy mouse control), and caused severe nausea in under 15 minutes of play. I don't think VR will work with large scale, free moving, FPS games anytime soon."
valve,30hup5,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Mar 27 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"Most current VR for the Rift is a sit down WASD experience, and it would be trivial for Valve to do this.  I have hands on experience playing HL2 and Portal 1+2 in VR mode.  It absolutely works, it is absolutely ready."
valve,30hup5,KahFean,2,Fri Mar 27 21:46:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you at this moment. VR is not ready for a game like this, but i'm sure that HL3 will use some new technology. I wouldn't be surprised if they are just waiting for VR to be ready for a game like this. Lighthouse might not be the right technology, but maybe they have already something in progress to break its barriers."
valve,30hup5,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Mar 27 16:06:56 2015 UTC,"Besides your VR hopes, I agree with the possibility of a Half-Life and Portal merger. I see no reason why Gordon can't find himself in the more contained Aperture Science labs and doing some thinking with portals or whatever ""F-stop"" is. Maybe he could kill Glados or have a love triangle with Chell and Alyx. ;)"
valve,30hup5,atomic1fire,2,Fri Mar 27 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"The more I try to imagine the right technology the more I doubt. I can't think of a feasible way to simulate the sensation and track the input of traversing across an incline, decline, positive or negative g-forces. I don't want the geography of the next HL to be unrealistically designed to accommodate VR. I don't want to walk around Kansas as Gordon Freeman with fun things missing like tasteful platform jumping. I also imagine events like the push back of an explosion, a charging enemy, or anything that would force our perspective to be moved involuntarily would cause disorientation and nausea if we can't feel it happening to our physical bodies as well. VR could limit the narrative and emersion of a Half-Life game for me. I think VR games are uniquely designed experiences that don't translate well to a FPS game like Half-Life. Any VR Half-Life may have to make design choices that make the end product nothing like a Half-Life game we expect or even want."
valve,30hup5,generalako,3,Fri Mar 27 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that valve might make VR that you don't have to stand up for?  I think a lot of people have been misled by their demos; just because their technology allows people to get up and move around doesn't mean every game will have to employ this.  They tested their early VR protocols in first person shooters, and you probably saw my other response to you about the rift.  It would be incredibly easy to have the player choose between standing and sitting play in the options; there is nothing forcing valve or any other developer to include the full range of presence feedback, and even when a game has the option, it's simple to choose what should be controlled by player motion (in a sit-down FPS this would be limited to upper body motion) and what should be controlled by classic input (in a sit-down FPS that would be WASD, sprint, crouching, and jumping)."
valve,30hup5,ProfessorStupidCool,2,Fri Mar 27 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"My personal experience and impression has lead me to be fixated on the idea that playing a traditional sit down FPS game is a fleeting novelty at best. Depending on the quality of the VR system, I'd go further and call it more of a pain than a pleasure. I hope I'm wrong, but what I gleaned from the things being said at egx rezzed is that the traditional FPS games, while bound to sitting down, are not being considered a top focus of VR application. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvXzXzydtzw"

There's open worlds and extra content everywhere. Everybody expects DLC and side missions and blah blah blah. Valve only works on something if it's interesting, so while a skyrim scale half life game would be awesome, I don't see them feasibly putting that much effort into a game they only intend to release for a single player. Even Half life Multiplayer would be constrained to single maps and game modes, with content dependent on fan contribution.  Edit: But to that point it might be cool if they did a multiplayer combine vs rebel game, but added solo gordon/alyx coop/single player missions to fill in the blanks for story reasons, with the multiplayer being more like team fortress."
valve,30hup5,thatsnotanargument,3,Tue Apr 7 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know If I should cry or laugh, when reading this title and the replies it has gotten. How the hell is this even a theory, and have any of you guys played the games at all? It's an integral part of the games, not to mention an integral port of the story of Half-Life. Anyone who has played both games can see the obvious references made to Black Mesa (which is referenced by name by Cave Johnson, in logos, texts, etc.). Have you forgotten the ending of Portal 1? ""hat the sign on the building outside, after you have killed GLADOS- and the camera is laying face-down on a roadside, shows? Black Mesa is the main competitor to Aperture Science in the development of portal technology. These are not two universes; they are the one and same. Having Black Mesa and the Half-Life story in the back of your mind is in many cases important to understand certain situations/conversations in the story of both Portal-games.   Furthermore, you can see Gordon Freeman's HEV suit and Combine units in Portal 2 at some point, and even the gravity gun can be seen on a table at one point. These elements are so apparent that it has even been openly admitted by Portal's writer, Erik Wolpaw.   We tried to keep as light a touch about it as we did in Portal 1. Fans of Half-Life will notice some things, but if you haven't played Half-Life they'll just kind of pass right by you. You're not going to see Gordon tromping through the facility.   Will we see the portal gun in Half-Life 3? Maybe. If Black Mesa, the company Freeman was working at, were developing this technology (Cave Johnson hints at Black Mesa stealing the technology from them), why would it be surprising if he came by it? Even Aperture Science itself is after all a substantial company in that universe, and Valve would not expand their importance into the Half-Life story in such a degree for nothing. I can imagine the portal gun, or/and Aperture Science itself having an important role in Freeman's journey.  A more relevant theory is the supposed influence/relevance the portal gun has had in the Half-Life universe. There are several references to the greek God Prometheus, who gave the powerful element of fire to mankind in hopes that it would use it for good purposes -- but it ended badly, and he was subsequently punished for it; maybe the Portal gun played an integral part in starting the apocalypse in the first Half-Life game (we were shown potency of the gun when we managed to send a portal all the way to the moon in Portal 2). Maybe the gun/technology is something that Freeman needs to destroy?"

valve,30hup5,Kill_Welly,3,Sun Mar 29 03:52:32 2015 UTC,Because Valve does have creative integrity and seems to value that over all else.   There's a reason why we aren't seeing yearly CS or Team Fortress incremental updates.

valve,30ea5b,Krobolt,2,Fri Mar 27 03:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think the added commentary is pretty interesting.  For starters I didn't know about the part with the manhack introduction, where if you go back to the area where the manhacks first attack, you'll find a rebel dead with one manhack. I always felt that if I killed the manhacks fast enough the guy would be able to escape. he got murdered anyway. Bummer.  Also I didn't realize that throwing the tv out of the window was a intentional design thing. I just thought it was fun throwing tvs at tanks.  Actually I throw everything I can throw out of the window because it makes me feel like a rebel.  FIGHT THE COMBINARCHY"

valve,30ea5b,T00FEW,6,Fri Mar 27 00:58:22 2015 UTC,The intention of this mod was to make areas more consistent in terms of visuals (there are a lot of parts in HL2 where it feels like they rushed development of areas) and to fix bugs.  Fakefactory keeps almost none of Valve's original visual design and takes a lot of creative license.
valve,30ea5b,Krobolt,4,Fri Mar 27 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"There are some parts of the original map that are hidden by crappy fog, they pulled the fog back and had to model some other parts of the landscape where it was missing, like near that bridge, the cliff is all new. I really like the volumetric light and fog they added, I wish I could add those to my install of CM2013, which already replaces a lot of the geometry."
valve,30ea5b,isoceans,2,Fri Mar 27 01:01:51 2015 UTC,It fixes a shitton of bugs and fleshes out the areas that Valve didn't have the time to during development. Seems worth it to me.

Based on what he said, it's been an ongoing project for quite a while, but they have no definitive release schedule because they believe it would hamper their work.

valve,30b52x,MrTra1tor,0,Thu Mar 26 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're not working on it, rather I think they're not just gonna release some single player game just becuase.  Valve is rather invested in multiplayer now, so a half life 3 without some kind of multiplayer component probably won't happen.  Portal 2 had a coop mode, left4dead showed they could have a story mode but still have multiple playable characters.  My guess is if Half Life 3 is released, it would be released in a form closer to left 4 dead and portal 2 where there's a lot of cooperative or multiplayer involved. Valve really isn't a single player company anymore. I think the single player stuff will still be there, but they'll probably expand the multiplayer side of the story.  Most of the multiplayer stuff for half life 2 and half life just seemed like your standard death match fare. Something like wolfenstein enemy territory where the combine and rebels are actively trying to fill objectives would be cool."
valve,30b52x,msphere2,7,Thu Mar 26 08:40:52 2015 UTC,I really wouldn't want that. I want a genuine single player HL3. Multiplayer could of course be there in some form but I want a single player just like HL2.
valve,30b52x,RobotAnna,0,Thu Mar 26 12:19:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. They want their games to be played for years after release and make a ton of money with user-generated content.
valve,30b52x,ShadowReaperGR,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:54:49 2015 UTC,The problem is I cant see that ever happening with the Half Life franchise... it was destined to be single player only and to be honest I'd be perfectly happy with Half Life 3 being the conclusion to the Half Life saga and wrapping up everything in a nice little package.

valve,2ztzew,ArchReaper,20,Sun Mar 22 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"Obviously the person in the video did very little research into the legitimacy of the Better Business Bureau. They are an organization that bullies companies that do not pay them. Valve does not care about such silly claims because they realize that the service they provide (Steam) is not dependent on what a fraudulent company has to say about them. Steam will continue to grow and thrive. This is not to say that Valve is great at communicating to consumers, but they do listen and try to improve. The also are more focused on innovation than doing normal upkeep. Valve has always been known for pushing PC gaming and will continue to do that at the cost of some negligence on the support side of Steam."

That's not to say that Valve doesn't have customer support issues. I'm not trying to say that at all... just citing the BBB is a really poor substitute for actual evidence, since they place the burden of proof on the company, not the person filing the complaint. An ""F"" doesn't really mean anything other than ""Hey, fuckface! Why are you ignoring me? I'm the Better Business Bureau and I'm like SUPER important! Hey, come back here!""  Well, pretty much."

valve,2ztzew,hobophobe,4,Sun Mar 22 00:43:54 2015 UTC,"Customer service sucks for most technology companies, mainly because it's a service used by a small minority of users (those having a problem), and their industries are ones where competition isn't a major threat (due to things like lock-in). The former means it's not a core competency. The latter means they won't win more customers by having better customer service.  It's easier for them to ignore you than to fix the problems, and the cost of improvement is basically hiring a bunch of people, training them, and having that cut into the revenue when the overall business (for most users) doesn't really improve that much versus ignoring the problem.  The open question is how to make these companies have a vested interest in customer service. Can it make them money if they get it right? Can it cost them money if they get it wrong? Can it be a lot cheaper to get right? And so on."

The reason you signed up for them is probably because you love their fucking games right, notably the Half-Life series. So I don't see why they wouldn't want to create a HL3.  Maybe they're scared that they can't deliver on the massive expectations from the community."
valve,2zmz9t,BoringAeneas,29,Thu Apr 2 08:41:32 2015 UTC,"Years and years of listening to the man speak public ally have convinced me to believe that it's not that he doesn't care for the half life franchise, on the contrary, it's that it was a stepping stone to building a great company. Valve is his magnum opus, it is the company he takes pride in and it is the sum of their combined efforts, how dynamic and creative they are. It's the opposite of what he experienced while working at Microsoft. If he only focused about the tech behind a single game, maybe we would have a different Valve, maybe it'd be a company similar to Blizzard that focuses solely on its platform and few games. Or we could end up with something like Dukenukem Forever as a company's efforts to release something perfect but never actually realized. All I'm saying is that while I want a continuation to that specific franchise, it might be time to move on, to lower expectations, and to be grateful to experience the half life games that we got. They were magnificent. Coincidentally, Gabe talked about Terry Pratchett just days before his passing and he mentions him knowing that there is a possibility of never getting another great book from his favorite author. It was eerie to hear him talk about it."
valve,2zmz9t,OverGold,4,Fri Mar 20 02:02:29 2015 UTC,Yeah that Terry Pratchett part was pretty eerie
valve,2zmz9t,shrekinator,3,Fri Mar 20 10:57:44 2015 UTC,I think it would be wrong to assume they're not working on it. I have a feeling they're just holding off completely concentrating on it until they get all their techy innovation sorted out.
valve,2zmz9t,BoringAeneas,7,Fri Mar 20 16:48:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're probably right, there's been rumors for years that a small team is setting up the story work and pre-production stuff. But Gabe has talked about it not being in the company's interest unless there are enough people that would like to. My understanding of Valve's structure is that people have mobile desks and can set up shop to work with anyone on anything. If a group of people gets big enough they have to justify their work. I wonder if it's the same for a Half Life 3. I wonder if source 2 and Var are converging technologies to make it finally happen. But I do know that Gabe himself just rather focus on other stuff. He's said so in that interview."

He wrote Discworld because he loved it, not to advance himself or to use his story as a tool to reinvent the book.  I can respect GabeN if he doesn't want to make more games, it is his company to do with what he wants. All I want to say is, where is the self-actualization?  He is focusing way too much on the medium and not the media. I am starting to worry about Valve and its lack of focus, and the future of my steam library.  Basically, Valve is so far up its own ass at this point that it is turned inside out."
valve,2zmz9t,T00FEW,41,Mon Mar 23 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Valve just recently unveiled the Source 2 engine and a VR headset it's creating with HTC to bring to market. Putting those two together sounds like a fantastic way to create a new experience for Half-Life fans.   My personal theory is that Valve really does care about its most beloved series, and has been developing the Steam network, Steam Machine, controller, and VR headset to pave the way for the surprise release of the most fantastic game in history.  I really hope that I'm right."
valve,2zmz9t,Hing-LordofGurrins,28,Fri Mar 20 00:47:58 2015 UTC,"Of course they are making it.  Why would they just give up without finishing it?  They've been working on it since the end of Episode 2- they're just taking their time because it has to be (as you said) the most fantastic game in history.    The question shouldn't even be asked.  Any answer fucks up his plan to not talk about it until they are ready.  He can't say no, he can't say yes, he can't say maybe.  Even avoiding the question pretty much confirms they are working on it, so that's not an option either.  It's a checkmate that he shouldn't be put in.  The answer is of course they are working on Half-Life 3."

I don't get why people act like Half-Life 3 is never coming out, especially when Valve is notorious for long waits."
valve,2zmz9t,gorgeseasz,3,Fri Mar 20 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"The difference is those games were confirmed in-development. The last news I remember that even came close to a confirmation was right after episode 2, Gabe said the wait for episode 3 would be longer than the previous two games. It is clear at this point that episode 3 isn't happening. If they ditched episode 3 and never started HL3 I would be pretty sad but there is no way for us to know if that happened or not. It's frustrating."
valve,2zmz9t,T00FEW,2,Sat Mar 21 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, Valve went dark about TF2 pretty soon after its announcement. It was assumed to be in development hell and labeled vapourware. It's situation was very similar to Half Life 3s today. It wasn't until E3 2006, about 7-8 years after the announcement, that the final version was showcased to the public."
valve,2zmz9t,Captaindoge4,5,Sat Mar 21 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"This man's post is an invaluable example of Valve's work ethic.  Team Fortress 2 happened during a period where the scale tipped for Valve- they were suddenly wealthy enough with talent and revenue that they were no longer required to produce a product just to sustain themselves.   I was a big Team Fortress fan back in the day, and I remember reading about Team Fortress 2 in gaming magazines complete with screenshots in 1999.  My friends and I were expecting to play the game together within a few months to a year.  It didn't release until 2007. The game was almost finished when Valve started ""talking about it"", but it wasn't good enough.  They learned a lesson from that- a very important lesson that is you don't fuck with your fans.  No news is good news.  I guarantee you they've thrown all of Half Life 3 in the garbage at least twice since they've started.  They are working on it."

It would really not surprise me in the least to find out that there were multiple times when they were on the verge of announcing Half Life 3 when a last minute decision from Gaben stopped that. There was a point when Gaben mentioned that there would be 3 big surprises (pretty sure it was 2014) in the year and I dont really consider anything they announced as being a ""big surprise"".  I wouldn't be surprised at all either to find out that there has probably been several working builds of Half Life 3 but there just wasn't something right or magical about it and Valve didnt want it to be released because it could be ""better"".   When we finally do see Half Life 3, its gonna be the next coming of Christ. Its going to be glorious.   The problem is when will Gaben and Valve decide that its good enough to release?"

It was clear what the guy was asking, but he had to beat around the bush to ask, ""is Valve working on any games right now besides Dota 2?"" And Gabe's response was even more careful. Why don't they just come out and say, ""it's not dead, but we're focusing on other things right now?"""
valve,2zmz9t,iwasazombie,3,Thu Mar 19 23:05:04 2015 UTC,Because if he says anything about Half-Life the internet will go apeshit about a project that Gabe knows they will probably end up scrapping anyway.

valve,2zmz9t,flobop,3,Fri Mar 20 03:28:59 2015 UTC,People getting excited about things that may not come and people getting disappointed about things that don't make it to the final version of products is exactly why Valve avoids talking about their games until they're ready. A lot of things they showed off about HL2 didn't make it to the final game and fans were widely disappointed.
valve,2zmz9t,Goofybud16,3,Fri Mar 20 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"I'm curious as to what knowledge they have learned. Most of their focus (from what I can tell) has been supporting their multiplayer releases, and building up their steam economy. And more recently the steam machines and VR stuff. And they have already said that they wouldn't hold off on a game release to wait for VR."
valve,2zmz9t,AniGamor,7,Fri Mar 20 03:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know that they are holding off for VR, but that they are holding off for things in Source 2. They want Source 2 to be perfect and bugless (or as close as possible) if they are going to put HL3 on it. They don't want a BF4 or Halo:MCC or AC:U. I think Vulkan may also be a delay as they want to have that in Source 2 and working properly.  I think that HL3 is going to exist, but not yet. They want everything to be ready, and if they are releasing it, they want it to be perfect. If they can release a beautiful game with great audio, visuals, physics, and it runs at a great speed, with few bugs, then they will have something they can release.  And leave a cliffhanger on.  And wait another 10 years to release the next one."
valve,2zmz9t,Cunt_flayer,4,Fri Mar 20 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"What is coming out that will be specifically tailored towards VR as a project costing tens of millions of dollars?  VR will be an afterthought in Star Citizen and most other games.     Valve has a chance to do something great here.  You have Valve, who wants to surpass or outlive any hype.  You have HTC who is all but dead, who only has one shot to recover from their spectacular failure in the mobile market (we're talking 3% market share and a 90% loss of value im the company).   Samsung is pussy footing around trying to link mobile and VR.  Oculus hasn't recovered from its acquisition or figured out what to do with its money.  HTC is creating a stand alone product that even the most cautious reviewers have stated is amazing at this early stage.     HTC can be catapulted to compete with Samsung again.  Valve can create an experience unseen before.  Is success guaranteed? No.  However, it is nice to see them taking a huge risk.     You know that after the meh towards the steambox controller, all valve has cared about is the control method for steambox and their future games.   They have a better shot at getting it right, because facebook has nothing.  They haven't had the multi year headstart with lessons already learned from failure."

Like they don't really have any motivation to continue with the series. It's hard to tell with Gabe, I don't think I've ever seen a straight forward response about anything half-life related since at least 2007.   If nothing else, it's clear that HL3 is not anywhere near the top of their to-do list."
valve,2zmz9t,Goofybud16,5,Fri Mar 20 01:27:51 2015 UTC,"While I can understand how one could get that kind of impression. I don't really think it means much. If HL3 was in development, there would be no way he could answer that question. They're not gonna fall into the same delay-trap they did with HL2."
valve,2zmz9t,hypocrite99,7,Fri Mar 20 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"They have a lot on their plate right now.  They are working on Vulkan, finishing up Source 2, working with HTC to get the best product they can for the Vive, finishing touches on the Steam controller, and working with OEMs for Steamboxes.  Vulkan and Source 2 probably come before HL3 because HL3 depends on Source 2, and they want good performance in Source 2 with Vulkan. The HTC Vive is probably also important, but less so, because they (if it ever arrives) want it to work well with VR most likely. They have to have a game that plays well on a normal screen AND in VR. Steam Controllers and Steamboxes are not directly important to HL3, but are still something they are working on and thus still require people to work on them."
valve,2zmz9t,ciny,4,Fri Mar 20 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"True, but it also works the other way. All this fancy tech needs software to go with it to actually go anywhere."

valve,2zmz9t,Goofybud16,2,Fri Mar 20 13:00:17 2015 UTC,Half Life 3 is beloved by fans. But! There's no way Valve can internally justify the cost in terms of developer time to work on HL3.
valve,2zmz9t,seruko,6,Thu Mar 19 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"They don't have to justify it.  People work on what they want to. Flat company. Gabe says ""K guys I am working on HL3 come join if you want"", people come join, they make HL3.  As long as it is possible your product will make enough money to break even, and isn't totally stupid, go ahead and make it. HL3 would probably make millions of sales within a week, if not less time. Lets say they charge $60 for it through Steam. If it were to sell 1 million copies in a week, that is $60,000,000. That is a lot of money, I think that could cover a lot of dev time. If they are able to do something like TF2, CS:GO, or DOTA 2 where they are able to use some form of item shop for something (HL3: Deathmatch maybe?) then that means even more profit.  If Valve can make millions a year off of a seven year old game (TF2), they can make HL3, a game everyone wants, at a minimum break even."
valve,2zmz9t,Pandemie1337,3,Fri Mar 20 00:11:10 2015 UTC,"Valves internal incentive structure does not align with spending 6 years in making a game anymore.  Nor does it align with GabeN whipping the resources together to get HL3 produced, even if he wanted it to be produced. Between the democratic decision making process, the employee bonus/profit sharing structure, and the things people at Valve are excited about it would be shocking if HL3 was going to come out in the next couple of years.    And because of the way Valve works, internally, and on projects, if projects aren't likely to come out soon then they're not likely to come out at all."
valve,2zmz9t,Captaindoge4,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought! I thought that HL3 being a necessary success, management at Valve (Gabe) would just decide to make HL3 and it would be done. But as Gabe explained the devs need to decide it for themselves. Which sucks, because I expect HL3 to be a GIANT project, and it thus becomes more improbable, that enough devs get together for that. Especially when there are so many other exciting project, like Source 2, Vulkan and VR.   Still, even though I mourn the dwindling hope of ever playing HL3, I truly believe, that whatever Valve does with their time, I will love it. Simply because they never failed at it before."
valve,2zmz9t,Thatonefreeman,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"HL3 will be more, may even break the record for first week sales. It has benefits, lots of benefits but valve works on what they passion for, not what you want. They also love to troll their fans a hell lot. Don't assume HL3 isn't being made. It probably is, just slowly. See all the tech they've been making, it may a just be for next gen games."
valve,2zmz9t,seruko,-1,Sat Mar 21 15:57:57 2015 UTC,More than 12 million people bought Half Life 2. At $49.99 that's over 500 million dollars in revenue. Seems perfectly justified in my mind.
valve,2zmz9t,Thatonefreeman,4,Tue Mar 24 15:03:08 2015 UTC,"12 million people did not buy HL2 at release. The 12 million number comes from an estimate by Forbes of total HL2 sales from 2004-2011. At least half of those sales were retail, based on numbers that Valve has published (which only includes retail numbers). Of which Valve made substantially less profit on. The rest of those numbers come from steam, which you may be aware frequently has sales."
valve,2zmz9t,seruko,-2,Fri Mar 20 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, 12 million and more by this point. Your point is what exactly?   Collectively Valve would still make a lot of money. Their distribution network has grown immensely since Half-Life 2 came out. Very doubtful a sale would happen off the bat, and even if it were to, Valve wouldn't undercut themselves on a sale. They're still a business at the end of the day.   My point is simple: they have the financial motivation. Now are the developers spiritually motivated? That's another story. Many people are expecting a lot from HL3."
valve,2zmz9t,Thatonefreeman,2,Fri Mar 20 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"12 million is a made up number. It didn't come from valve. Your claim of 500 Million you made up whole cloth out of your own imagination. The only hard numbers come from Retail and as you apparently are totally ignorant nobody makes a lot of money off of retail. In fact the most profitable part of the retail market is in used games.     Many people are expecting a lot from HL3.     Which is not an argument in favor of producing it. Especially when Valve's focus is on F2P/Micro Transactions, Next Generation Hardware Modalities (seriously listen to the interview where GabeN hems about investing in hardware based VR because TMS is on the horizon it's in this sub on the front page), and the Steam Platform.    Read the Valve Handbook, look at their bonus structure. Valve is incentivising the opposite of working on HL3."
valve,2zmz9t,lefixx,2,Fri Mar 20 23:36:47 2015 UTC,You make a compelling argument. I do think gaming's future lays in the hands of VR manufacturers and deeper interactive experiences.  I have read the handbook by the way. 'Tis a good read.

Plus this is restriction is market only (and steam's primarily purpose is to buy games -- people seem to forget this).  Not to mention this has been around for such a long time I'm actually surprised you didn't know about it. In fact, in the last 3 years I've had to deal with it twice. Both times I was expecting it, but it wasn't an issue. I waited to make the purchase I needed to make and carried on my way.  Now that doesn't change the fact it sucks, I guess, but it's only a week. Ultimately it doesn't really matter, in that time the item you want could be cheaper (or just as likely the same price). So I don't think you're missing out on too much, especially if you're planning to go through third-parties anyway.  All that said, the main reason this isn't going to happen is because it's there to prevent bots from scamming the market and means valve doesn't have to go to more extreme measures (like remove items you paid for, because a bot scammed valve). To this end it has largely succeeded."

Even if he were, my stance is the same, it's to prevent market bots and scammers. You should probably be sure of what you want to buy before you do, and if you're only doing it to make a quick buck via trade.. well.. you're gaming the system.

It has been an issue for me since 4 weeks or so and still is now. I don't get how much until I hit ""recent increase in use"", valve could provide some clarity on that and how is it that unverified funds can be used to purchase games.  Yes, steam primarily purpose is to buy games but don't forget that majority of the money valve has comes from things other than selling games. This is roughly how much content creators only earn. Also for example, in-game purchasable like the compendium is what funds and provides major tournaments for DotA2 which in turn helps the community to grow. So you think valve should worry about selling games and fuck all?   A week for you may not be anything but a week for many can be the greatest deal. After all, time is money.  Sorry but I do not see how making an item untradable for 7 days can help combat scam -- fraud at most. Here are two ways how valve can do better:    Funds have to be verified after X amount Funds that had been verified can be used to purchase items w/ NO RESTRICTIONS from the market and in-game"

valve,2z2sy9,trakmiro,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, let's think about this. The witch and the tank are going to team up right off of the pedestals, that is if the tank can even fit through the tube that raises them up, and if they do, some serious shit is going to happen when the cannon goes off. The tank is immediately going to charge whatever pissed him off the most when they made eye contact. The witch is going to pms all over the closest thing regardless, and one can only hope it's Peabody or Atlas, because they'd take the least damage. Gordon and Alyx are going to likely sprint for the middle to get a gravity gun or a crowbar, so Gordon can effectively fuck shit up. Gaben is going to fuse with episode 3 and hide until the end of the game, so we won't worry about him. Everyone else is probably dead in the first 20 minutes because of the tank and witch, because nothing can stop them hand to hand, it's in everyone's best interest to just get the fuck out of there, and sneak back to the pedestals to scavenge weapons. In the end, the tank is going to most likely come out on top. He's an unstoppable killing machine in this environment, without heavy guns, he's practically unstoppable. However, if someone set up a trap that could incapacitate him, and manage to light him on fire, the whole game could change."

Sure it isn't great, but when they announce something they do it, it isnt like we bash Nintendo for not announcing new games every day.      Also, most companies delay games, valve sets a date and hits it, that's why the announce so late.     Obviously we're excluding HL3, but if that's your only reason for giving an F it is stupid"

All this just because you're not willing to take a few seconds to check if a game uses Uplay before purchasing it?  Of course, I'm sure everyone agrees that it'd be much better if Uplay wasn't required, but hey, this is what we have, and removing these games entirely is not the solution."

It's like the early access debate.  People complaining that valve should get rid of early access titles.  If you don't like them, don't buy them.

Game developers being friends with other game developers I would understand, but two digital distribution platforms would specifically be trying to get as many customers as possible, and exclusivity is a great way of doing that. Steam and Ubisoft both know it'd be a bad move, business wise, to take Ubi's games off of Steam. That way they both lose sales, but Ubi lose harder. Steam could care less, it's still got hundreds of other titles to make money from, but Ubi only have their own games, and a lot of people won't buy their games if they're not on Steam."

Doing 3024x1680@90 (pre-warp resolution) while using the latest and greatest graphics is simply not going to happen, you get a much more pleasant VR experience by using less fancy graphics and throwing the spare cycles at doing better anti-aliasing and making sure the framerate stays stead at all times."

The entire PDF is about getting amazing performance, not about how to emulate real life.  After skim-reading the pdf, v-sync has to be on, and lots of things have to be done (anti-aliasing, etc) for the VR effect to work and not be nauseating. A lot of the classic faux-3D cheats don't work as well in VR (like normal mapping, and cube mapping).  Now that they have the technical groundwork almost done, they can work with artists to make much more photorealistic maps.  The new Source engine is capable of much more, I can almost guarantee it."

I'm kind of a Portal fangirl, so that did greatly influence my reaction, but probably one of my favorite things about the demo (besides Atlas and GLaDOS, obviously) was the fucking tiles on the floor.  They look so incredibly.... linoleum-like. That small detail really stuck with me.

valve,2y8oe0,Akdag,7,Sun Mar 8 01:40:33 2015 UTC,"Limiting you framerate probably won't solve the problem. Frame tearing is caused by sudden and very large frame drops. You may want to try lowering your settings to prevent this kind of thing from happening. Source games are generally very efficient and not prone to drops, what is your framerate?"
valve,2y8oe0,ROFLicious,4,Sat Mar 7 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"You're thinking of frame stutter. That's when the framerate drops below the monitor's refresh rate so the same frame gets displayed twice. Frame tearing is a side effect of having a higher framerate than your refresh rate. It happens because only half of the frame has time to be rendered to screen before a new frame is ready, so you see half of one frame and half of another. The solution to frame tearing is vsync, which limits the framerate to match the refresh rate. Sometimes it introduces input delay, though."

valve,2ybzc3,akn244,7,Sun Mar 8 12:41:16 2015 UTC,"Catalin, when an email seems weird or not real, it's probably some kind of scam. One way to tell is the email address. Everything before the @ symbol is the email's name. They can choose any name to go there. Everything after the @ symbol is the website it's coming from. So, in this case, we ignore everything before the @ and see that it's coming from taxidentity.com. I haven't visited it, but everyone else and I immediately recognize that an email from Valve would come from valvesoftware.com or steampowered.com.  Also, watch out for clever misspellings. For example, the lowercase letters ""r"" and ""n"" next to each other kind of look like ""m."" So, if the website is something like steamcornmunity.com, it's also not real. That says ""steam corn munity.""  Even still, there's other things that can be red flags. Pretty much anything that says you ""may be eligible"" or that you can ""claim"" something is not real. Same goes for anything saying you need to scan your computer, wire transfer money, or enter your credit card. If it's weird and from someone you haven't met, ignore it. If you're still not sure, you might copy and paste the email's text in a Google search and see if other people got the same thing and what they had to say."

valve,2y4f2j,TheGreatJonatron,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:13:15 2015 UTC,"If Valve sells this, what is left to modders then?"
valve,2y4f2j,lostintimelostinspac,0,Fri Mar 6 21:34:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure modders are going to be custom-fabricating Steam Controllers and VR headsets.
valve,2y47rb,TheGreatJonatron,6,Fri Mar 6 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"Can't find the link but I know one guy made a demo where he used impossible room geometry to make it appear feel the player was continuously moving and not confined to a box. When the player approached the end of the real life space, they were guided into hallways that were really just turning them around to orient them correctly again.   Obviously this cannot be applied to standard games, but would be an interesting way to handle the space problem with games built from the ground up this way.  Other than that, I really can't see any solution besides the virtuix omni/cyberith virtualizer for real life movement. I think it's safe to say we're all hoping to see valve push these lighthouses to their full potential."
valve,2y47rb,metilco,2,Fri Mar 6 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"That's a neat way to solve it, that would definitely be fine for very VR oriented games. Makes me wonder if there are any other kinds of mind games devs could use to make the player think they're traveling."
valve,2y47rb,metilco,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"I was just reminded of another way devs could fool us into thinking we're moving. It's pretty simple, but the effectiveness scales up with the space you have, and is definitely along the lines of that thinking.  The idea would be to have a huge square room, and the walls would circumscribe a circle which becomes the players forward path. In reality the person is continuously walking around a huge circle, but the software would make it so it appears that they are walking along a straight path.   This still has some of the same problems when the player reaches the actual limit of the room, but I can already imagine non-immersion breaking ways to address this. For example, you could make a simple demo where you are walking along a straight sidewalk with grass to both sides of you. If a player reaches the end of real life space, the grass could shoot up and grow as a way to show a blocked path.   Obviously you would be able to feel that you're turning left/right, and that would have an impact on presence. But as VR develops and we find more and more ways to trick our brain, I think a combination of ideas like this and better hardware will prove ""good enough"" for achieving presence for most people."
valve,2y47rb,hypocrite99,7,Mon Mar 9 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"They'll have to fall back on moving around using the controller or a keyboard. Otherwise it would be like going back to the pre-Super Mario Bros. era, where games would only take up a single screen.  Otherwise, since no normal person can have several rooms dedicated to VR gaming, it could mean some sort of return of the arcades. Just like in 90's VR movies, where they would have large warehouses with suited up people running around."
valve,2y47rb,delorean225,1 point,Fri Mar 6 15:04:10 2015 UTC,I would love to see VR arcades! It would keep me from spending all my money and sanity on stuff like this too.
valve,2y47rb,14EyedOhmu,2,Fri Mar 6 20:28:44 2015 UTC,"I think that the Lighthouses will be more for the artistic projects while most games will use omni-directional treadmills or hand controllers with sticks on them. What I'm hoping we see some day are force-feedback suits or gloves, but I think that would be rather difficult to accomplish for a number of reasons, including safety."
valve,2y47rb,14EyedOhmu,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I could see that. I think they're just trying to make the vive platform as versatile as possible. I wonder if they'll only release all of it as a bundle or sell things separately so people playing more traditional games wouldn't have to pay for motion controllers? Now that I think of it, it would be neat if games had a temporary view mode similar to how 3rd person games often have a first person look around mode but instead be from vr with controller movement to vr with real movement so you can look around your environment with more freedom. It could be useful for puzzle elements and things like that."
valve,2y2vuy,Vexarex,3,Thu Mar 5 23:42:07 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but at this point, I've gotta stop getting my hopes up. Chances are they'll just be focusing more on what they've already shown at GDC."
valve,2y2vuy,iwasazombie,3,Fri Mar 6 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"But it'll either be interesting or not, the important thing is that it seems that they're really trying to push things forward for everybody."
valve,2y2vuy,jumpinjesus,2,Fri Mar 6 03:22:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but it's worth noting that Chet Faliszek is the one giving the presentation. He's not a VR expert or a particularly technical person, he's a writer who has worked on storylines for Half Life 2, Portal, and L4D. That's why a lot of people think he might be there to demo a new game for Source 2."
valve,2y2vuy,Walking_Pneumonia,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right, but to me it's more likely that he wrote the Portal VR demo that was shown at GDC and will be showing more of that."

valve,2y2vuy,Walking_Pneumonia,1 point,Wed Mar 11 00:28:52 2015 UTC,"Doubting it. Those 'demos' that were shown at GDC were mostly for examples on optimization and rendering, which wasn't streamed. Since this will be streamed, and easily accessible to public (compared to smartphone pictures of a projector), I'm betting they'll be demoing a little bit more exciting stuff there."
valve,2y2vuy,pryvisee,3,Fri Mar 6 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but it sounds like more VR discussion: ""Chet Faliszek talks about what Valve has learned from working internally and with outside developers using SteamVR as we all look towards creating content for 2015 and beyond."""
valve,2y2vuy,popltree2,6,Fri Mar 6 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"I know everyone is extremely skeptical of Valve after all the years, but with the HUGE push forward (SteamVr, SteamBoxes, SteamControllers, SteamLink and Source 2), mark my words, we will see something at EGX that will absolutely surpass any expectations we had in mind. Valve does not want the Steam Boxes, SteamVr and Steam controllers and SteamLink to flop.   Valve laid out all the pieces, they will show us a BRAND NEW game with the BRAND NEW SOURCE 2 ENGINE that will hype the shit out of everyone.   They did it with the Half-Life 2 e3 demo, they will do it again. 2015 is the year of Valve, watch."

It would make even more sense to show off a brand new game on Source 2 at e3 to start the hype closer to late 2015 when all the hardware comes out. But who knows, they could show off a Source 2 engine demo at EGX, but they have to show something off, otherwise all this VR steambox stuff would go bad and it has to be absolutely incredible."

There would be more of a sneaky campaign going on to build up the hype a little if so.  Maybe we'll see some suspicious activity closer to E3 if we are really fucking lucky. But if they announce something I'm sure it will be something unexpected - I doubt half life related. That would just come so out of nowhere... It could actually just flop in their face and seem really weird. No building up hype at all to the most overhyped game of all time? That's just a sick joke. A slap in the face to the fans. Fuck that.  I think HL3 marketing will begin some day with some sneaky clues everyone will skeptically dismiss. But then the clues keep adding up and up and up until suddenly everyone realizes there is something happening.  Then valve will announce they are attending a specific expo and then they will finally drop HL3. This will likely be in a while still as they want to test out the new steam VR platform a little, feel like people are comfortable with it and have gathered feedback, and then finally valve will announce HL3 and truly capitalize on what makes this system incredible.  Whatever they announce soon, if it's game related, it will be a brand new game or one of their other installments."

valve,2y1sb4,modgone,7,Thu Mar 5 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"Sucks for me as the shipping costs from the Valve store to my country are outrageous and for some reason there's a tendency to having customs problems (unlike purchases on ebay, amazon, or any other site.).

valve,2y1sb4,rawros,3,Thu Mar 5 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"Well I'm pretty sure they'll distribute it from Europe, and almost certainly sell it at other stores like Amazon, GamesStop, eBay, fnac(maybe), etc."

valve,2y1mgz,devindudeman,12,Thu Mar 5 18:07:10 2015 UTC,I think it's the 'I don't want to build one' plus the smaller form factor.  I'd love to see some sweet micro atx cases come out with horizontally facing graphics card arrangements.  Then I could finally retire my old tower to the basement :)
valve,2y1mgz,gsparx,3,Thu Mar 5 19:10:19 2015 UTC,Wasn't the point of large form factors to have enough airflow to cool down components?
valve,2y1mgz,That_Nameless_Guy,3,Thu Mar 5 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"That's part of it, but also its easier to pack more power into a larger case.  Most of the steam boxes are custom designed which means they can build them a lot smaller.  They don't have to be easy for the average joe to open up and change.  You can get small form factor cases for your own build but they're probably not going to be quite as small because they're built for a variety of hardware"
valve,2y1mgz,gsparx,12,Fri Mar 6 02:03:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  The whole 'at the same price as consoles' doesn't quite seem to be holding up.  Ps4 is 400 XBone is 360, and the cheapest steam machine in that list starts at 460.  I really don't think we'll see the proliferation of steam machines unless they can compete in price to current gen consoles.  Maybe as they gain momentum they'll be able to start manufacturing them in larger quantities and reduce price.  Until then I don't see this catching on.  Maybe in a few more years.  Edit: 460, not 480. Didn't see the iBuyPower one"
valve,2y1mgz,gsparx,5,Fri Mar 6 04:01:05 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. I would have a hard time justifying the cost right now. Who knows though, the community could potentially bring a lot to the table. When these are more prevalent we could see a lot of added value. Think XBMC. These things are completely open to be upgraded, hacked, re-purposed. Emulators come to mind.   They're also not going to be stuck in 2015. It will be years before the PS5 comes out. With a Steam Machine, I can add some extra horsepower ever couple of years when it starts feeling sluggish. And there are potentially a lot of savings to be had over consoles through the steam store."

valve,2y1mgz,Noisetalgia_,3,Thu Mar 5 18:54:58 2015 UTC,I doubt Valve will ever do a SteamOS only exclusive... and if they do that you could still install it for free on your PC so...
valve,2y1mgz,gsparx,2,Thu Mar 5 18:57:13 2015 UTC,And if you don't have a PC capable of running it?
valve,2y1mgz,cereal7802,2,Thu Mar 5 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"Of running Source 2? Then it's time to upgrade lol. The machines arent meant to replace your PC anyway, they are meant to allow you to play in your living room more comfy (aka replace consoles)."
valve,2y1mgz,foolofatook29,3,Thu Mar 5 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with your observation of the intended use case, but I don't see the point at these prices.  Now the Steam Link, that's much more intriguing IMHO since I already have a beast at my desk."
valve,2y1mgz,illBoopYaHead,3,Thu Mar 5 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"With a Steam Machine, I can add some extra horsepower ever couple of years when it starts feeling sluggish   you say that, but from what i have seen, many of these steam boxes use laptop style video cards, meaning unless those start being sold at your favorite PC component store, you are boned just as badly by your steambox as you are your console. The same can be said for the cpu since most of them are intel based. Seeing as intel seems to like to make a new socket every 20 minutes, chances are pretty good that your steam box will be very limited in upgrade opportunities. This all ignores obviously any issues of cooling since these steam boxes are all very compact. if upgrades are to be a thing, you have to hope the tolerances for heat allow you to do as such."
valve,2y1mgz,tupacsnoducket,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"Since you threw out a hypothetical scenario with getting a steam machine, why wouldn't you just buy/build a computer to hook up to your tv?

valve,2y11uq,dangertable,13,Thu Mar 5 15:31:46 2015 UTC,"It's really interesting that just seeing a whale in VR made him anxious, even scared. Games are going to need to be toned down a huge amount to work in VR. Also what he says about games accepting the limitations of the platform is absolutely bang-on. Anyone who says VR is still a gimmick couldn't be more wrong."
valve,2y11uq,Aloysius722,10,Thu Mar 5 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"But, I think he was saying they have to be toned down at first, but can be ramped up over time.   Just think about the first time an audience saw a ""moving picture"" film. It was an old black and white film projection of a train, and the audience flipped out and ran for the exits afraid that the train would hit them... Since then, like this article says, we've become so desensitized to blood and gore and shocking stuff on our tv and in video games, that seeing a person's head get blown off doesn't even have an effect.  Enter VR. For a time, whales and fish will scare us or make us anxious, but given time, sharks and zombies and whatever other nightmares we can think of will become common place in VR, and we'll be okay with it."
valve,2y11uq,iwasazombie,7,Thu Mar 5 17:39:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I totally agree. The interesting thing after that is how much being desensitised to things in VR will desensitise people in real life. Obviously lots of people try to say normal 2D games do, but I'm pretty sure the consensus is that they don't. Will real ""presence"" change that?  Another thing I thought was interesting is how other people have mentioned not wanting to take off the Vive. I guess people have had the thought for years that properly good VR might end up with people practically living in VR. Worse, people actually addicted in bigger numbers than those currently addicted to 2D games.  I've been thinking for a while that perhaps it's good that VR and especially Steam's system of content creation and distribution is going to be very important in the future. I mean, especially with the automation revolution vaguely around the corner it seems like an obvious potential route for people who are unemployed through no fault of their own to go down.  ...Sorry I digressed..."
valve,2y11uq,Aloysius722,3,Thu Mar 5 18:33:26 2015 UTC,It's fun to witness this as it makes history. I'm really looking forward to where VR takes us in the years and decades to come.
valve,2y11uq,iwasazombie,5,Thu Mar 5 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"I’ve thought about that whale demo every day since Thursday. The demo itself was great, but more than that I’m thinking about my reaction. Had I seen that same scene on a TV screen, I would have had absolutely no anxiety whatsoever, in fact I probably would have hoped a shark would have come out of the abyss to make the demo less boring. But because I experienced it in a world where my movements changed what I saw, it felt like something so much more than that. It was an unrealistic experience that felt very very real.   I predict that in a few years the idea of people evoking this sort of reaction to a VR environment will seem rather quaint.  ...much like we now view the reactions of early cinema pioneers who supposedly jumped out the way in the belief that the train projected onto the screen in front of them would somehow burst forth from the screen and run them down."

valve,2y3ko1,Broken1ce,4,Fri Mar 6 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"I would say no. I think the goal is to make PC gaming more accessible and convenient, but PC is so much more than just gaming. The PC experience as a whole will never fit in the living room in my opinion. How about both? Valve obviously wants to push SteamOS, but it being free an all, it isn't really enough as far as business is concerned. Of course hardware manufacturers will want to turn a profit out of this. I don't really know what to think about long term goals honestly. I think Valve is just looking for a way to reinforce its stranglehold on PC gaming and take it out of Microsoft's. Many people will still want to buy pre-built machines with everything pre-installed and pre-configured. I mean, just look at how many consoles have been sold. Steam Machines target people who would rather opt for ease of use rather than build their own system from scratch, but, unlike current console manufacturers, Valve won't limit the software and hardware to their own platform. It's Linux, what more is there to say? I would expect at least greater conformity and standardization across SteamOS (Microsoft has a history of abandonning established standards in favor of their own, for better or for worst). Valve championing Vulkan seems to point in the direction that they indeed want their platform to operate under strong standards. Better performance is also to be expected since SteamOS is optimized for gaming, unlike Windows' jack-of-all-tradeness. Except for third party support (obviously), I would really like for someone to tell me what is great about gaming in Windows because I simply can't see it for myself. I expect a lot is going to go smoother in SteamOS insofar as gaming is concerned. Better performance, less crap to worry about and potentially have to fix, etc. Once again, I think ease of use is what Valve is aiming for, and Windows certainly isn't the easiest thing ever.      Developing for a console means you have to deal with publication but you have access to a platform that has great conformity since you target specific hardware. This means that fine tuning is a very straightforward process, but that you are limited by the console manufacturer and the hardware/software of the machine itself. On the PC side, it's the polar inverse. You are not limited by artificial restrictions such as walled gardens and you have no limit over specific hardware specs but at the same time have to keep in mind that there are a lot of hardware (and software) variations that each need their own fine tuning, which requires exponentially more work and testing. I think Valve is trying to unite the best of both worlds with the Steam Machines. Like I said in 6, Steam Machines are PCs, and like all PCs they will have varied hardware. The fragmentation of the platform means more work getting everything to run smoothly across the board. I personally don't think there are any pros to gaming on console. People will mention ease of use, price, exclusivity (of games), portability and other factors as to why consoles are better than PC, but while most of these were true some 20 years ago they certainly don't hold much ground nowadays. Steam Machines do not really address the problems the PC platform has, it only offers a streamlining of the experience, which is what I think sells consoles more than anything (that and disingenuous marketing). Now for the pros of PCs as a gamer: freedom, customization, performance, exclusivity of thousands of titles, cheaper software, cheaper hardware, etc. Oh and mods. Which is something Valve seems to embrace with SteamOS. They even made their game engine Source 2 completely free to content creators. Valves wants to make Steam Machines as easy to use than consoles and make them cheaper for equivalent performance. If they only get these two things right, these systems will already match and/or surpass current consoles. But since the Steam Machine is a PC, it doesn't stop there. Every advantage you have with a traditional PC you will still have with the Steam Machine. You could upgrade your machine whenever you and your wallet would feel like it because you wouldn't be restricted by the walled garden of your system. You could install (or make) mods on your favorite games  because the software is free of that sort of restriction. Hell, SteamOS is open sourced software, you could even mod your machine's OS itself to have it better suited to your wants. Trying to do something similar with a console will leave you with an unusable brick and a voided warranty. Ease of use, once again. You'd have to install and configure everything yourself if you want to build your own machine. Some people understandably don't want to deal with that. It's often cheaper to buy everything separately and build yourself. Plus you have more freedom over the parts you want and don't get malware pre-installed on your computer (looking at you Lenovo)."
valve,2y3ko1,incelinside,2,Fri Mar 6 04:46:02 2015 UTC,So why is everyone on /r/games pretty much against the Steam Machine? I feel most of your responses are positive rather than negative. It seems everyone is bashing the Steam Machine due to pricing? Is the pricing bad? It seems long term it is more beneficial for developers and gamers.  Also for your response to question 1. Why do you feel PC as a whole won't fit in the living room?
valve,2y3ko1,incelinside,2,Fri Mar 6 05:10:15 2015 UTC,"Some of the machines are effectively overpriced. But this is a lesson the manufacturers will have to learn one way or the other. If they want to compete with consoles, they have to price their system competitively. The problem does not lie with Valve's approach, at least not as I see it. Maybe I'm a bit too enthusiastic about Steam Machines but I want them to succeed, as well as SteamOS.  To clarify what I said in question 1, let me give you some examples. Do you see yourself writing an essay in a word processor in your living room? How about programming? Doing lengthy research on that TV 10 feet away from you? That's what I meant when I say PC as a whole won't fit in the living room. At the end of the day, PCs were designed to be office tools and they'll never truly reach their full potential outside of the office."
valve,2y3ko1,Thebutttman,3,Fri Mar 6 06:05:04 2015 UTC,"Don't forget, these companies existed before steam machines. So there is a market for pre-built gaming PCs. If there wasn't these companies wouldn't exist. Steam machines are just another offering and now will have common branding recognition."
valve,2y3ko1,thealphamike,2,Fri Mar 6 13:38:10 2015 UTC,"1. Is the goal simply to put the PC into the living room?  The goal is to get PC gaming in the living room more than personal computing. The living room is a more socially acceptable and physically conducive environment for games. Thus opening up the possibilities for adoption by the more casual and social demographics. This means more people use Steam as the primary source for buying games.  2. Is the goal behind the Steam Machine to sell hardware or to push SteamOS? Are the goals different for long term vs short term? What are the long term goals?  The goal is to get as many people to use Steam for their gaming library as possible, like Apple trying to get people to use iTunes as their music library. Valve makes money from game sales on Steam. So short term would be to get PC gamers to use their more casual and social living room spaces. Long term would be to get developers to create more casual and social gaming experiences. Like many of the most successful social Wii games, for example.  3. If it is to push hardware, why would they allow the SteamOS to be free to the pub and allow their new input devices to work with any PC?  Both of these make it easier to use Steam as your primary gaming library and store.  4. What are the pros and cons for having SteamOS vs Windows as a developer?  As a developer, you need several applications to create assets and code. The difference between SteamOS and Windows is like the difference between the Xbox Dashboard and Windows. Windows is designed for productivity and multitasking. SteamOS is like the home screens of the Playstation or Xbox; designed for buying and playing games as well as the community and friend structures.  5. What are the pros and cons for having SteamOS vs Windows as a gamer?  If that computer’s only purpose is gaming, SteamOS will make it simple to browse and play games. If you want to also do Photoshop, make a Powerpoint, and Skype people, you’ll need another operating system. The idea is that most people aren’t wanting to do that kind of stuff from their couch.  6. What are the pros and cons for developing for a PC vs Console?  Consoles traditionally have the benefit of exact specifications. As a developer, you don’t have to worry about supporting every graphics card, processor, whatever, and making it run well on all of them. You can optimize the experience for just the one thing.  Cons for console developing could include distribution agreements for the different companies. For example, Microsoft had a history of taking a large cut, inflating prices, and charging developers a lot for updates. You’re also subject to the success of the console sales themselves. If you developed your game for Wii U and the console didn’t sell so well, your game wouldn’t either. That’s why you’ll see them porting their games to other things.  7. What are the pros and cons for developing a Steam Machine vs Console?  You introduce the same problem again of everything not being the same between steam machines. But, you’re not bound to the success or demise of “steam machines” as a product, because you actually made a PC game. Steam has obviously been much more open and friendly to gaming customers and developers in general so there’s less corporate runaround.  8. What are the pros and cons for a PC vs Console as a gamer?  This is an entire huge thing as big as Mac vs PC. Consoles again have the advantage of the exact controller with the exact hardware designed to give you exactly the experience you’re seeing. PCs will have differences in quality between devices. However, PCs come with scalability, which means you can get visual quality superior to consoles if you’re willing to pay for it. Either way, the PC is likely more expensive. It also has several upgradeable components, so you can get more RAM later when it’s cheaper.  PC also comes with the option for mouse and keyboard input. A lot of gamers like the precision of a mouse and the number of actions a keyboard can be bound to, and these types of games are usually too complicated for the controller interface of consoles. The simplicity of the console controllers makes them easier to adopt and better for multiplayer in the same location. It also sometimes means you can focus on the story/experience without having to remember which number to press on the keyboard.  Multiplayer servers only exist for so long on consoles. Eventually, the companies keeping them running won’t want to pay for them anymore. PC users host their own multiplayer servers. Most consoles also charge subscription fees to play online: Playstation Plus and Xbox Live. They lessen the annoyance of this by giving subscribers games every month.  9. What are the pros and cons for a Steam Machine vs Console as a gamer?  Everything from the previous question, plus…  Consoles are typically not backwards compatible. You can’t play a Playstation One game on a PS4. This can be true of PC games after a point, but it’s much longer. My Steam library still has Half-Life and if I get a Steam Machine, I’d still have it. Because of that, the library of existing games you could get for a Steam Machine will trump any console.  Consoles are less expensive, as mentioned before. This is partly because the manufacturers can take a hit, knowing they’ll make money from the games sold.  You can install Windows or Linux to a Steam Machine if you want, whereas modding a console is against their rules. Modifying games and adding additional content is also part of the Steam and PC landscape, whereas consoles tend to only sell limited specific DLC.  Besides that, if there’s some proprietary game like Halo or The Last Of Us that you really want, that can sway your opinion as a gamer toward a specific console.  10. What are the differences between having a Steam Machine vs a custom built PC from the same manufacturers?  A steam machine is a faster shopping solution, but they are essentially the same. A steam machine is a custom built PC, just with a steam controller and SteamOS. It’s just a set of hardware specification presets with nice custom cases.  11. Why do people buy custom built PC's from manufacturers?  Better specifications than Best Buy floor models, without the hassle of having to build it yourself. Building your own PC is like fixing your own engine. It’s good to know how it works and you feel really good about it and you love your computer more after, but it takes a lot of time and learning and you have to be really careful. In many cases, the amount of time you spend may not be worth the amount of money you save, depending on how much your time is worth.  A Summary  Gaming has a tendency to be seen by the public majority as anti-social. PC gaming does even more. As gamers, we’ll argue “but I’m online with my friends!” but you know that’s different from a casual party environment. There’s a huge market of people who bought a Wii to play Wii Sports or Just Dance sometimes when friends were over. Dance Central may have had full body Kinect tracking, but that majority only wanted something casual and social. There’s a different vibe to a LAN party where you all have your own screen and a game where you’re sharing the same screen. Steam Machines are already “out” in the sense that you can just connect your computer to your living room TV and play games. Their release as a separate branded and product suggests the intention to widen the consumer base to those who don’t want to build their own PC. They want to just buy something that works and have a good time."

valve,2y1vfs,IsaiahFeldt,2,Thu Mar 5 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right! But, couldn't we sort of count the updated Dota 2 as a Source 2 game?"
valve,2y1vfs,iwasazombie,2,Thu Mar 5 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"A updated Dota 2 wouldn't really count as something they would ship with the new engine, nor would it be the best game to show case all the new features of the engine. Valve would want a stellar game to ship the engine with to show consumers just how amazing their new engine.

It could very well be Portal 3, Left 4 Dead 3, or even Half Life 3."

Just throwing some thoughts out there, but i really think that this portal demo is just a demo, because it really has no boundaries on what they can make in the portal universe, be it a potato, or a shiny surface.."

At this point lots of sites like Engagdet and Gamasutra and IGN are reporting on all the cool tech that Valve is showing off. Still no update from Valve on the site. Could it be that they are still waiting to announce something before that page goes live? Also, why the change at all? My thoughts are, if it isn't game related, than it's just their way of saying that VR and some of their new hardware is good for the PC market in general, not just for Steam/Valve.  Finally, we've seen strong demos of Unreal 4, Unity 5... but have we seen Source 2 in action yet? It seems like they need to show something from some game..."

valve,2xymxy,blankvisual,0,Wed Mar 4 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, but I honestly feel this is the year, I was always skeptical about Valve announcing anything, even year after year people would say ""Half-Life 3!"". I don't believe HL3 is going to be announced, but I strongly believe we will see l4d3 or something Portal related. If we don't see that, then for sure it's going to be a game we haven't heard before, that may be original.   Too many things point to a new game and if Valve announced Source 2 yesterday and there's still presentations tomorrow and EGX next week, then for sure we will see something running in the Source Engine 2. You can't announce an engine and not show anything, it wouldn't make sense to do that.   Not to mention all the tweets from Valve employees saying how hard it is for them to keep ""the secret"".   We are going to see Valve announce a new game within the next two weeks for sure."

valve,2xxndh,Henry132,18,Wed Mar 4 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"More in depth description of everything in the demo clip on Engadget: http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/04/htc-vive-hands-on/   It looked as if I was in some kind of repair room. A disembodied voice came over the speakers and told me to open a drawer. I looked around me, saw some built-in drawers and walked over to them. I opened a drawer, only to see blueprints and tools. The voice said I opened the wrong one, so I tried again. This time, I saw a moldy cake. Apparently that was the wrong one also, so I opened another one. It contained tiny, little cutout people at tiny, little office desks who went berserk at the sight of me. The disembodied voice told me that I had made a mistake and that I was now their god.    Giving up on me, the voice then told me to walk across the room and pull on a lever. I did that and a giant door opened. Behind it were two of Portal 2's androids, Atlas and P-Body, lying on the floor broken and in disrepair. Suddenly, Atlas awakened, and lumbered toward the room. It was so imposing and realistic that I backed away instinctively from the door. The voice then told me to press on a button to expand its components so that I could repair it. I did so, pulling on its front exterior to expose its electronic guts. The next thing the voice told me to do was so complicated and full of technical jargon that I knew it was impossible. The voice told me to keep calm while also warning me with increasing urgency that if I didn't accomplish the task in time, I would fail.  And, of course, I did. Atlas collapsed on the floor with great noise and fanfare; the floor gave way and the room started to fall apart around me. I was told in a deadpan manner that I was now not qualified to do anything. Then, a familiar voice popped up. It was GladOS, Portal's AI antagonist, wondering out loud how a robot could possibly fail this simple mission until a camera popped by and saw me, to which she responded, ""Oh."" As the room started to get rebuilt around me, she said that I had done well as far as humans go, and that I was relieved of my duties. The demo then faded out to an outro and it was over.

A few months ago one of the guys who worked at Burnout's Paradise open world joined Valve, so I highly expect that to be a good thing since Source 2 needs a way to make games feel way better in terms of mapping.   Maybe merge more maps and make them load in the background while you are still playing so you won't encounter loading times. But that will be tricky since you can noclip all of a sudden and try to rush at the end of the map, which can cause some problems."

Aside form that, the tools have all been vastly improved. Realtime lighting previews in hammer, particle/model/texture editing tools that aren't ran through the game (Well the game is running in the background, but all the tools run in a window), and a new interface that isn't out of 1998.  As far as the engine, there's no more long compile times, mainly because all the lighting is dynamic (finally!). Source 2 is a huge improvement. They've fixed everything I hated about Source 1.

valve,2y00u7,spacejames,1 point,Thu Mar 5 07:05:31 2015 UTC,"Controller will apparently cost $50, steam machines come at many different prices - as far as I understood, you can use steam link (also $50) to stream games from your PC, so that might be enough. What remains is the Vive, which I haven't seen any price related information on. But I guess it will be somewhere in the regions of the Oculus Rift, which is at $350 now. But maybe the consumer version will be cheaper, hard to tell. On the other hand the Vive will come with these two controller things (or do they have to be ordered separately?) which might lead to a higher price.  So what it comes down to, given you don't need an actual steam machine to play games on but use in home streaming instead, you'll probably pay something around $500 for everything."
valve,2y00u7,oversloth,2,Thu Mar 5 11:12:10 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, the Vive comes with the two controllers, and the two ""sensors"" or whatever they're called, plus, the headset has more little trackers and sensors on it, which makes me think it will cost more alone than the Occulus Rift. Not to mention, the resolution for the Vive is nearly 2k for each eye, which I believe is higher than the Rift.  I've heard people compare the Vive to a Rolls Royce. It's the best of the best, which means it will probably have a higher price point... but, they are giving away the tech for the ""lighthouse"" (the two sensor things that go in the room and track the headset and hand controllers more accurately) for free! That means we'll probably see more affordable versions of VR that take advantage of their tech in the years to come.  As awesome as the Vive sounds, I'm personally going to wait a few years before embracing VR. It's like the first iPhone that everyone rushed to buy. I waited for a decent Android option and embraced the SmartPhone technology ""late"" but I saved a lot of money and got better tech for waiting it out.  However, if HL3 came with the Vive this winter, I'd buy it as soon as I could get my hands on it if it is $500 or under."
valve,2y00u7,iwasazombie,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I think between 300-400 is a good estimate for the vive. While it seems super cutting edge with all the little sensors, they're actually quite simple and require much less fancy math positioning than other options. The sensors are similar to wiimote tech only lasers rather than just lights. I think the real price is having a computer that can push out all those pixels at 90 hz. It's equivalent to a 4k+ monitor which is very much at the high end currently. Also consider that frame rate drops would be much more jarring with vr and may even cause motion sickness so slipping by with a low end pc won't really be an option."
valve,2xzr03,Sampai_,6,Thu Mar 5 05:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well, find something you're good at and pursue that thing. Keep doing it, never stop, talk to people in the industry, don't be afraid to ask questions. Enthusiasm helps.  I visited Valve when I was your age - I was in your same situation, even - and the gist of what they told me was to not worry too much about school (though obviously you should be trying your hardest), to go out and learn and create content and ship a product that you're proud of. Make Source mods, make TF2 hats, learn a programming language, download Gamemaker and make something, do whatever it is you feel like you'd be doing at Valve. Some of the employees there are high school/college dropouts.  Focus on building up your skill set in a T-shape, with the middle pillar being your main focus and the other ""branches"" being things you're also good or proficient at. For example, my main pillar is video production, but my ""branches"" are graphic design and user experience design. Keep a portfolio of content you've made and shipped.   Also, Valve seems to be hiring a lot of Digipen graduates, for some reason.  I don't work at Valve currently (in fact, recently I've been trying for a job at IGN), so I wouldn't know how the hiring process worked, but if it's your dream and nothing will discourage you then go out and do it."

valve,2xrqhp,cunningmunki,5,Tue Mar 3 08:54:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It is very much just HTC's implementation and device.   There also looks to be a lot of non-steam content on the vive via HTC.  I don't see it as valve hardware but it is their flagship for now.     Check how steamvr is seen as a platform for different hardware in the same way that steam and android are platforms. https://steamdb.info/static/img/blog/53/steamvrplatform.png  I created /r/vive which is focused on the HTC device but fully expect /r/steamvr to have a lot of content that won''t make it to my subreddit.  As things are so early, there is a lot of overlap right now and people are not seeing the difference."
valve,2xrqhp,500500,3,Tue Mar 3 16:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that slide from the dev days, which made me wonder if there'd be multiple hardware platforms.  I guess Valve aren't clarifying everyone's assumption that the Vive is the ValveVR device since they'll get their chance to clear up the confusion at GDC very soon."
valve,2xrqhp,spiderman_spiderman,2,Tue Mar 3 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"I would assume so, it's in Valve's best interest for more VR competition to use their platform."
valve,2xrqhp,k337,1 point,Tue Mar 3 09:01:03 2015 UTC,"It's possible that SteamVR is a framework or standard that Valve are in control of, and that VR devices should adhere to it for Steam game integration."
valve,2xodev,Heaney555,26,Mon Mar 2 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"I've been trying not to get hyped, but I'm going to say it.  This shows promise.  I don't think you present things like a new version of OpenGL, or a VR set, or a new controller, or console-like pc's unless you have something to get people interested in buying those devices.  With the games that are already on steam I have no reason to buy any one of those devices.  I have beaten HL2 multiple times and don't really care to play it again with a VR headset, or with a new controller.  Updating the graphics with a new API might get a little interest, but I wouldn't pay much for that update.  I also already, obviously, have a PC that runs HL2, so I won't jump to buy a new PC to play a 10+ year old game, even if it looks amazing with a new API.  You would only invest in these devices if you knew you could sell them and you can't sell them without something to make me want to buy them.  You also don't bother releasing those products to market until you know they will sell.  If HTC says the headset will be available to consumers before the end of the year (holiday time), you can bet there will be some good games to use it with, at that time.  Valve wants to make money, they will make sure they have some games that make you want to buy a new PC, a headset, and a new controller."
valve,2xodev,elpedro84,8,Mon Mar 2 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"We all want HL3, but do we want it like this? There's a risk of it becoming one of those kinect or eye toy games that sacrifices game play to shoehorn in the hardware gimmick"
valve,2xodev,g0_west,13,Tue Mar 3 00:44:48 2015 UTC,"Firstly, all that hardware stuff is optional. No way is Valve going to make it required - they're too smart for that. But developing HL3 with VR in mind? It's a no brainer.  Secondly, the hardware is kick ass. Kinect was only gimmicky because of its limited application. How many practical game applications were there for Kinect? You can push things around, make rudimentary control schemes by recognizing body motions and etc. How do you fit that into an FPS or a racing game without also needing a controller? I know that video is the worst example - there are certainly fun kinect games out there. But can you think of any successful AAA game that makes extensive and good use of Kinect?  But VR and Motion controllers? The potential is IMMENSE. 3D sculpting environments for Artists; explore Google Street View in panorama; watch a movie in a virtual theater with long-distance friends; go to the Venus for a field trip. It makes me so FUCKING PUMPED.   Anyway, for video games - well, I mean, look at this Half-Life 2 VR demo. Just the immersiveness of that reloading process - imagining the exhiliration of running down corridors, taking cover, reloading, shooting around corners, all with basic VR and motion control. Just thinking about the bridge level in Half-Life 2 makes my stomach do flips (in a good way). And most VR headsets are getting dedicated motion controllers - which is rad.  Thirdly, the results are already in. VR is fun as fuck, and the majority of people love it.  I thought it was cool before I tried it - but when I tried it... hot damn. Just that feeling of IMMERSION, looking around corners, aiming and shooting, - and I was using a keyboard and mouse.   It's not perfect. You know it's a game. You know you're wearing a headset. It's not the most realistic thing ever. But it's rad - and you've gotta try it out before you decide.    TL:DR; Kinect was a gimmick because it was super limited. VR is not a gimmick - it's a kick-ass experience and it has immense potential."
valve,2xodev,JackHemming,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"I think Valve knows this and their the last video gaming company in the world that would try anything gimmicky if it's hardware related. If they throw out L4D3 and HL3 in the same year and make all their past games VR compatible, I'm sure people will have an incentive to pick it up. Especially if they pack it with a steam machine, the steam machine controller, HL3 & L4D3, along with TF2, CS:GO, HL 1,2 and the episodes all ported over to source 2 with VR, people would buy it. I would gladly drop 700-900 for a VR starters kit along with a steam machine, along side some nex-gen games like HL3 & L4D3. And I'm sure Valve is starting to get worried because people are definitely forgetting everything about steam machines, so they need to make a push right now and this is the year to do it."

valve,2xfxtx,Artie_Fufkins_Fapkin,11,Sat Feb 28 22:11:20 2015 UTC,"Valve is notoriously known to be incredibly secretive and vague about everything they work on. I was looking into something called ""the uncanny valley"", which is basically when something looks almost real, but isn't and our brain is able to pick up on this. Our brain realizes this and then gives us the feeling of fear because our brain is protecting us from something that isn't actually human or is trying to tell us that a person is sick. This photo is from 2011 and ever since I saw it as the cover for numerous blog/articles about valve related news, it has given me an ""off"" feeling. Something about the picture on the left does not look real. It looks like it was rendered in a video game engine. Wouldn't it be clever for Valve to have shown us the source 2 engine all the way back in 2011, by showing us a portrait of Gabe Newell himself? Just like when they showed G-man from Half-Life 1 and G-man from Half-Life 2 right after at the e3 Half-Life 2 tech demo. I mean it looks so realistic, but something is off about his chin and the lighting doesn't look right, even the lines on his forehead don't seem to match, as well as his eyebrows. And the weirdest thing about the image is the chin looks blocky, sort of like what an object in a video game looks like when the AA is turned all the way up and it is trying to look round and smooth. The mouth and the pours do not look right either.  March is around the corner and GDC and egx are literally less than 2 weeks away. Has Valve been trolling us this whole time?  TL;DR- The picture of Gabe Newell on the left is how realistic Source 2 looks like, but I'm probably insane."

In other words, she's actually just skipping the eye and talking directly into the peoples brains. Which really introduces sort of a bizarre ""Snow Crash"" reality way sooner than I would have guessed. So, she's solving the coding problem, [door distraction] there's the sort of the CCD front-end problem, which is kind of hard, and she's like well, that's a bitch, why don't we just skip that, figure out what the protocol is to talk to the brain. And it turns out, one of the interesting things, it's a way more compact representation of information, so, you know, that's gonna happen, that's something you guys should be thinking about, that your subjective experience of reality is probably going to be driven directly into your brain much sooner than I think most people expect.

It's possible that they thought quite a while ago ""these 2D low FOV monitors that gamers use are simply never going to be enough to make Half Life 3 as immersive as it deserves to be"", and so will have HL3 as a VR launch title.   This is either really good satire or stockholm syndrome.  Everything hardware related to Valve has been underwhelming.

The controller has been through what, 4 iterations now? and the VR stuff still hasn't even been seen in the wild.  I love steam and Valve but I want them to work on the amazing games they have a proven track record of making and to focus less on this superfluous stuff.

It couldn't render text properly and had a whole heap of other issues. The main issue being you can't see anything outside the VR which is why it is doomed to failure.  Something like Hololens may improve the situation because it is AR instead of VR.  VR is still no more than a gimmick you show your friends.  But whatever. Time will judge me correct or wrong either way.

valve,2wxcd8,jibjibman,1 point,Wed Feb 25 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"VR changes everything.   I've used a DK2 Oculus and was mildly impressed but it still isn't a game changer.   DK2 is much lower quality than what the consumer headsets launching this year willl be.  Imagine using a DK2 with:   Higher resolution so you don't see the pixels anymore Full positional tracking so you can lean your head or body as far as you want (even stand up or sit down), even if you're not facing the tracking camera Much higher comfort and much lighter on your head Full binaural positional audio built in to all games through an easy SDK Even higher refresh rate (75 HZ --> 90 HZ) so your brain is fully convinced it's real now   That's Crescent Bay. The latest prototype (DK2 is from late 2013, CB is from mid 2014). People have used it and confirmed all of the above.  It's the minimum benchmark for consumer VR.  All in all, you sound like a guy saying ""bring back the Mac making apple!"" when Apple were launching the iPhone.   People thought Motion Controls was the next ""big thing"".   Motion controls need to come after VR, not before. That was their issue.   Hell, people thought VR was the next big thing in the 90s.   That's just a stupid comparison. If you seriously think there's no difference between VR in the 90s (240p LCD display with 50 degrees FOV that struggled to hit 10 FPS and had a latency of 500 ms, with no positional tracking) with the headsets launching this year (1440p OLED display with 100 degrees FOV at 90 HZ solid and a latency of below 20 ms with flawless full positional tracking) then you're just biased.   I love steam and Valve but I want them to work on the amazing games they have a proven track record of making and to focus less on this superfluous stuff. I don't even care for HL3, I just want some great storytelling by the guys who brought us amazing games in the past.   But you simply can't reach the next level of storytelling and gameplay without virtual reality.  Oculus knows it. Valve knows it. Sony knows it. NVIDIA knows it. Samsung knows it. Razer knows it.  You can sit in the corner and shut it all out if you want, but trust me, by 2016 there will be over 1 million Steam users with a VR headset, and by 2017, having a VR headset will be as much an expectation for a PC gamer as a graphics card.  VR is a game changer.  If you want to do that RemindMe bot thing and come back in those times and see if I was right, you can."

This is just another fad like motion controls that will amount to nothing in two years time (which almost all those companies jumped on too, remember?).  All I can say is meh.

valve,2w8t00,rowedahelicon,6,Tue Feb 17 22:32:54 2015 UTC,"The things described in the linked post, aren't really Valve losing their way if you ask me. From what I've seen Valve are doing better than they did 5 years ago, although they do seem to be spread thin.  Valve was never good at communicating with the community, not much changed there, but it looks like they have never worked at this many projects at once.  The Steam Machines are a huge project and almost all the bits and pieces are in place now. They don't have much to do with trying to compete with Microsoft, though. SteamOS exists to offer the Steam experience on a couch, not to dethrone Windows. Consoles are aimed at a different demographic as well.  Other projects are at least 1 game, an engine, a controller, some vr stuff and probably other things. I'd say now is the wrong time to complain, wait till after CES."
valve,2w8t00,sharkwouter,2,Wed Feb 18 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"Perhaps losing their way is the wrong thing to say, but clearly there are a few major issues going on that need to be addressed.  Valve isn't good at communicating, but that needs to be changed. Now more than ever if they plan on tackling on more and more."
valve,2w8t00,P373R1,10,Wed Feb 18 06:51:15 2015 UTC,"Valve are broadening their horizons at the cost of their personalized touches to both their games and their client software.  We obviously have no insight into valve's business model, however I feel that as they slowly branch into more potential projects; (in order of smallest to largest)   Source 2 Development of the Steam client Steam Machines (+Controllers) DOTA2 CSGO TF2 Other ""one time purchase games"" (L4D3? HL3?) that will probably never exist   I feel as if they lose the ability to expand and create great features for their products because their product base is expanding so rapidly, sure they still make good stuff, but some of it is starting to get Pay to win which understandably has an appeal to them, but its almost like the fun features are being ignored, and the features where users spend money are easiest to get approved.  I would have absolutly no idea how to run a multi million dollar gaming organisation, but it feel like the walls are closing in on their trademark games from being the fun spritely events, based around fun new mechanics toward a new metality of ""create a gamemode / mechanic that costs money""    TF2 - Duck Journal (completely optional, but was the major part of the update without them actually releasing a map) Dota2 yearbeast, only just released, purchasing the CM arcana basically gives your beast a full level advantage, which has discouraged me from even caring about the year beast anymore. Not a complaint from me, but others possibly. CSGO has operational passes, and I actually love these, but only because it rewards skins, and missions keep me engaged in the game. really well done, but again pay to play oriented   Most of their gameplay is remaining free, and I love that about them. but the new optional content is becoming paywall slowly but surely, and the game may as well not have seasonal updates to the regular non spending player."

Really though, it's not that good and if it doesn't tickle you explaining it won't help.  Still, there's more creative mental effort put into this, just in recognizing an opportunity to successfully fuck with a photo, than there is in making a template reactionary comment with the le's and the XD's.

These are posts on imgur   Yeah that shouldn't excuse low quality, I have high standards and I intend to keep them that way as there isn't a strong reason to lower them, criticism helps the best content rise and punishes shitty content. Without high standards nothing would improve.  Posting on reddit requires some base level on confidence and pride in your work, or at least the expectation people will like it so you will get upvotes (unless they are trolling or whatever.)   Let them post crap.   If people being shit and doing shit things is just met with passive ignorance they will just keep doing it and they won't be aware that people even dislike it, those negative qualities are then seen to be rewarded with karma so more people emulate them until the majority of the content and community is just crap. Survival of the fittest doesn't just happens because things are better, it happens because the things that are better make it so the things that are worse cannot succeed.   (It should be noted I don't really ever expect that much good quality content from reddit especially due to the upvoting system which ruins any potential for that along with accounts and everything. Enough to keep me browsing to some degree though and I will still go against negative behavior I see.)"

Most likely just one small piece of the absurd amount of material Valve leaves behind. It actually looks like it could well be Citadel concept art. The objects remind me of the Grunt Barrels from HL1 Xen, maybe an early iteration of the HL2 Citadel Pods meaning to be more clearly linked to those.  It is interestingly difficult to find the source for the image. I haven't yet. It's not part of the http://www.valvesoftware.com/jobs/jobs_tween.swf movie, i don't think - either that or the .swf has some kind of activescripting in it to hide the image unless embedded properly.  nvm just showing my ineptitude with firefox profiler  http://www.valvesoftware.com/images/jobs/jobs_banner_image.jpg  I really can't make up my mind what these are supposed to be. The immediate resemblance to space shuttle booster rocket nozzels is probably not correct?"
valve,2vw4lo,eugd,2,Sun Feb 15 03:49:26 2015 UTC,"I think it looks exactly like shuttle nozzles. However, I don't think it's from the citadel because they use a blue color scheme. Portal is also mostly about blue colors if I remember correctly. Maybe it's something new, or just another location in the half-life universe? They had lots of rocket engines at black mesa. Half-life 1 had a lot of orange in it. They are going to release black mesa source as a game on steam (newer and better looking than the free one with the full story, including the final chapters)."

Various indie games come with both Android and PC  versions and being able to buy both and then download the Android version to phone would just be so much better.

If they made it so that it wasn't a direct continuation, fans may be unhappy since we've been looking for a direct continuation for 8 years.

valve,2ux4ze,Fl3xerCSGO,8,Thu Feb 5 22:31:41 2015 UTC,Looks like you got reported for hacking or griefing. Well either reported or temp banned. Look at http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/overwatch/. If they banned you it means that they looked at your replays from your perspective to double check.
valve,2ux4ze,Better_MixMaster,9,Thu Feb 5 22:45:23 2015 UTC,"Link me to your steam account.  Overwatch basically is a system where users report you if they suspect you of cheating (in competitive match making).  8 rounds then gets submitted to several overwatch investigators (they have 150 wins and I think a rank of gold nova or better) who decide whether or not you were indeed cheating.  In this case, you probably were cheating.  A VAC ban will soon follow once your hacks are detected.  You will no longer be able to play source engine games once the VAC ban occurs.  So yeah, you should have thought about cheating before playing cs.  Good riddance."
valve,2ux4ze,joker231,-3,Fri Feb 6 00:10:09 2015 UTC,You don't know that he was hacking/cheating.
valve,2ux4ze,JERAXXUS,9,Fri Feb 6 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"Valve pointed out several months ago that the overwatch system was working.  People don't just get overwatch bans.  Especially people who clearly look like they don't play the game.  The only situation I could see where a player got overwatched wrongly would be if they knew how to play the game and sprayed through some smokes and killed some people.  If you hop on your first time, it's clear from overwatcher investigators by the way you play.  So as I said, you don't just get overwatched.  There's a reason for it."
valve,2ux4ze,joker231,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Not true. A friend of mine got Overwatched on his main account, and proceeded to purchase another copy and play some more. Before he had even won ten games to get placed into a bracket he was banned once more. I know this guy is NOT hacking. Absolutely 100% I know he's not hacking, so we don't know why he was banned twice. He has since been playing on a third account and has not been banned with roughly 50 wins."
valve,2ux4ze,aaronbgraham,-2,Sat Feb 7 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"Well, when my friends and I played together. Vote ban/grief systems became wow you're good now get ban rekt HAHAHA. So... he could have just been good and the enemy team votebanned him."
valve,2ux4ze,Quantum_Dranger,3,Fri Feb 6 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"Once again, it doesn't work like that.  The other team (as well as teamates on your own team) will report you.  The only people who can remove you from the game is your entire team (requiring 4 votes to kick you).  Overwatch bans happen after the game after enough overwatch investigators have reviewed your case.  If he got a temporary overwatch ban, he was banned for griefing.  If it's a permanent ban, he was hacking.  I'm sorry, but I really do trust the overwatch ban over your friend.  Overwatch has been proven wrong once or twice on professionals.  It is pretty dead on with new or normal users."
valve,2ux4ze,joker231,0,Fri Feb 6 17:08:25 2015 UTC,It wasn't an overwatch ban it was from a different game (ace of spades) but it was a proof of concept that these things can be corrupted
valve,2ux4ze,Quantum_Dranger,2,Fri Feb 6 23:49:41 2015 UTC,Are you talking about your ban or about OP's ban?  I can't really understand what you're saying...
valve,2ux4ze,joker231,0,Sat Feb 7 00:00:17 2015 UTC,I'm talking about easily exploitable vote kick/ban systems in general. I am also defending OP because these things do happen.
valve,2ux4ze,Quantum_Dranger,3,Sat Feb 7 00:05:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, they do.  So let me ask you this.  Lets say you have GeT_RiGhT playing against someone who just started playing the game.  When you watch get right, you see him shooting through smokes because he knows positions to peak, etc.  If you didn't know it was get right, (aka The Suspect) you would watch for the play style.  Does he peak common corners?  Does he pre aim or prefire common corners...even if there isn't someone there?  There's other examples of this but I'll leave that for you to decide.  Now lets talk about the new player.  They have no idea about timings around maps, don't know peak spots or common corners, don't know about spraying walls, etc.  Generally, new people won't even know that they would be caught if they use cheats.  Hence, this guy had no idea what overwatch is.  So, lets figuratively say this person is looking at people through walls or snapping to people.  This is probably what this guy was doing in this case.  More experienced players who hack will only use a radar hack or wall hack (in most cases but not all).  Their aim is there, but they know where the player is.  They don't peak corners when someone isn't there.  Either way, as you said, there isn't necessarily a way for OW to wrong you.  It's been over a year since the beta was released and I'm pretty sure only 1 professional player was Ow banned.  I haven't heard of any other players being wrongfully banned.  This system is not easily exploitable because if you call the player a hacker and everyone else says he isn't, your OW score goes down, making it so your opinion doesn't matter as much.  You as an overwatch investigator must guess what hacks the user is using directly.  This is the page you get after watching a case  I hope this helps you understand why the overwatch system is pretty good."

If this lives up to its promise, it could very well spell an end to the awful choices developers have to make about what graphics engine they use.  Which is interesting to me because of the number of gamers who run Windows pretty much only as a game boot loader. If the pressing need for Windows (i.e., DirectX) is gone, then there will be much more choice to run other more efficient OSes as the boot loader (i.e., OS X, Linux or Steam OS).  That basically leaves Windows with just the corporate/office market propping it up. It'll be fascinating to watch."

valve,2ugmmr,Slukaj,7,Fri Feb 6 17:01:30 2015 UTC,"I'm struggling to see how it would mean better graphics.  A competent developer can make an antiquated engine look stellar. Case in point, Titanfall's use of Source. Any developer that solely believes that new engine == better graphics is a poor developer from an engineering perspective.  Heck, look at the difference in quality between Valve's most recent Source games (CS:GO, DOTA2, Portal 2) and the original Source games (Half-Life 2, CS:S, DoD). The difference in quality is astounding.   Other things a new engine could focus on rather than graphics:   Improved multiplayer/netcode performance (CS:GO, DOTA2) Improved artificial intelligence and agent logic (Left 4 Dead, DOTA2) Improved content production process (Steam Workshop, Portal 2 Map Editor)   My dream job is also working at Valve."

There's probably a team of people whose primary focus is porting it, but there's also a team whose primary focus is CSGO updates; not all of valve works on the same thing.  I'd definitely agree that porting other games to Source 2 would be great, they just decided to start with Dota 2 for whatever reason. And I believe for Black Mesa, Valve gave them a newer version of Source than had been publicly released with a full SDK. No idea which version, but I'm not sure that it would be Source 2, just because it was probably not finished enough by the time they started working with Black Mesa. All just speculation though."

valve,2tsftr,MDKAOD,2,Tue Jan 27 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"He actually thinks Valve can save Linux on desktop, by making one unified  large binary distribution version of the linux kernel."
valve,2tsftr,MDKAOD,5,Tue Jan 27 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's safer to say he ""concedes to the belief"" that Valve would use large binary distribution even though it goes against how Linux should work due to the fact that library maintainers have purposely not fixed bugs because some packages rely on those bugs to operate properly. That's the point he was making about never breaking user space. A package may work because a library has a bug that is relied upon, but that doesn't make it any less of a bug. He highly dislikes maintainers who call bugs features because of downstream reliance on the bug.   Fix the bug in the library and fix the bug in the packages. Valve has to compile large binaries because that's the only way to ensure they have compatible packages and libraries across distros and installations. It's a case of ""it shouldn't be this way, but it is, and Valve's hands are tied, and that's how the 'year of the desktop' comes about even though it goes against everything Linux always stood for.""  It's all about concessions being made in order to push adoption rate."
valve,2tsftr,strangetv,2,Wed Jan 28 01:13:21 2015 UTC,"No, it is not because of bugs. Torvalds is talking about the issue that different distros ship different versions of libraries, programs like steam and games depend on. There is no unified standard when it comes to such libraries, different distributions are made up of different versions of libraries, sometimes some libraries are not even available. Thus you cannot compile a program once and ship it, as it is the case with windows systems, because they might be binary incompatible on many Gnu/Linux distributions. You either don't compile your program and ship the source code (not an option for Valve), so it can be compiled by others for a certain distribution, or you compile your program on your own for ALL possible distributions (system configurations). Valve actually went yet another route, by shipping Steam together with its own ""little"" (huge!) snapshot of a whole system - imagine the mess everyone doing that! This solution is ugly, hard to maintain and what not, but that is what Valve needed to come up with in order to bring non-free software into a free world.  In short: The title is greatly misleading!!"

Trace design onto Reynolds brand ""Freezer Paper"". This paper is waxy on one side and paper on the other. Trace onto non-wax side. Cut out positive or negative areas (based on your preference) with xacto knife. Place cut out freezer paper stencil on a shirt and iron it on. The wax sticks to the shirt without damaging it, but creates a good bond and seals off parts you don't want to bleach. Spray lightly with 50/50 bleach water from fine mist bottle. Sit for 2-3 seconds and immediately dab with paper towels to avoid setting and bleeding under wax paper. Repeat spray and dab as desired until you like the color you get. Remove stencil and dunk shirt in tub of water or run it under the faucet to stop the bleaching process. Wash the shirt as you normally would (be sure to rinse beforehand extra well to avoid bleaching other clothes in the wash) and enjoy the finished product.     Again, /r/bleachshirts is incredibly helpful and will answer any questions. There's also videos and tutorials. :)"

So far, the things that have come of that are things like VR support for HL2, TF2, and Steam, plus the general helping out of VR as a budding medium with blogs, talks, and presentations, and working together with Oculus with Abrash ultimately moving to head up their research team.  It seems likely that Steam will be the medium for buying and launching games, but also that Valve would have a cabal working on at least one VR game.

valve,2ruae5,bakkouz,23,Fri Jan 9 08:51:06 2015 UTC,No pressure of release dates = game is never finished.
valve,2ruae5,strongbadfreak,23,Fri Jan 9 10:02:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's less that and more the pressure of a lot of them being perfectionists.

I would assume Half Life 3 has been started multiple times and then scrapped and restarted."
valve,2ruae5,overrated44,2,Fri Jan 9 11:19:29 2015 UTC,iirc they have committee meetings that decides on whether or not a project is producing the right kind of value for the effort being invested. i'm guessing ideas and projects do get shot down at some point if most people see no point in working on it.
valve,2ruae5,curiouscorncob,3,Fri Jan 9 11:53:55 2015 UTC,No pressure also means that someone does something because he/she simply loves doing it.  Such games made by people who enjoy making them are always a masterpiece.

Team fortress and Counter strike are like 10 years old and they keep receiving major updates, which probably demands a lot of people"
valve,2ruae5,tvidotto,8,Fri Jan 9 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah but not all of the 300 employees are in game development. You figure minus the typical keep the office running staff, you've got people working on Steam OS, people working on that controller that hasn't shipped, and a ton of people working on the store 24/7.  Honestly the store is the biggest reason (IMO) they don't ship more games. The financial pressure to ship was gone once the store started to sell more than just there games. Quoting a source below that I found.   Someone once said, if you make a game and put it on Steam to be sold, you get 30%, Valve gets 70%. If the same thing would be on retail, then you get like 10%, game distributors (like EA, ACtivision) gets the 90%. While these numbers are really not exactly true, you get the idea.   Valve provides the service - Store, online distribution, Steamworks (achievements, VAC, Steam cloud) that developers can use. They even licence Source Engine if someone is willing to buy a licence.  Making things click takes money, bandwidth, etc. Valve got the ready package, Steam that handles that. After all, since they are a company, they try to make profit alongside of things. Just like any other company.   Now add the micro transactions from things like skins, hats, cards, etc. They could never make another game again and still pull in millions each year from every other developer."

IMHO, dev days sole intent was to encourage developers to port their games to linux so that a non-windows OS would be viable. There were a lot of talks on that subject.  They also thought they had their arms around a mouse/keyboard replacement but found they needed to go through more iterations.  Valve is a strong believer in constant iterations and this may not be compatible with hardware production. They probably pulled in hardware partners too soon and as a result pissed many of them off when they determined they weren't as far along as they had hoped they were.  In the meantime I stopped waiting and built my own steam/xbmc machine and have been very happy with it. All I want is that steam controller. Anything that does a decent job at removing the wireless mouse and keyboard from my living room is a welcome addition."

valve,2rflk8,iwasazombie,21,Mon Jan 5 20:51:49 2015 UTC,Not rumors. Black Mesa will get a full release. Valve told them they could sell it.  I can imagine Valve wanting them to release it before they even talk about HL3. It's an awesome way to pull a new audience into the series.

A big thing I noticed, is that it didn't rush me, the game wasn't afraid to take it's time explaining thing, or letting me figure things out on my own, rather than the whole game just being a siteseeing tour with a bunch of text and cutscenes shooing me along."

I find going back to them that the story moves slower but the action is more intense than a modern game.  I think this is why modern games often seem boring because they are trying to have much smaller difference in pace. There stories are explained faster and their action is slower and more cover based giving gamers plenty of time to think.

valve,2r3a55,CookieTheEpic,10,Fri Jan 2 14:24:54 2015 UTC,"The mod that was released wasn't complete. Most notably, it was completely missing Xen. Once Black Mesa was one of the first things to get Greenlit on Steam, the developers said that not only would they complete the mod, they would release Black Mesa on Steam as a full game which you have to pay for, which -- I assume -- will include things that aren't in the mod.  There is an ARG dubbed ""The Pizza Code Mystery"" which started all the way back in 2012, relating to Black Mesa. This could very well be a part of it, although the people trying to play along in the ARG have been stuck trying to decode a particularly nasty hex code which has no patterns and so far no cipher that has worked. Or maybe this is completely unrelated to the ARG and is just a marketing gimmick by the Black Mesa devs to advertise the possibly soon to be released full version of Black Mesa.  Or maybe it's related to Half-Life 3. Probably not, though, as I think the owner of bmfr.us is part of the Black Mesa development team."

The consenus was that they are most likely to be revealing / releasing a new game engine in 2015. I am sure they will plan to launch a title on the new engine. Without sounding like a douche, basically please stop whining. Valve is not some cash cow yearly title developer and i personally don't expect them to be. They release quality games and they take their time to ensure those games are quality."
valve,2r12eu,Hokay168,1 point,Thu Jan 1 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the your answer. I suppose a new engine without a new game would be pretty unlikely. However, I was only aware of rumors of the new engine, until now. Thanks again."
valve,2r12eu,Hokay168,2,Sat Jan 3 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"Well, i'm not exactly running off anything but rumors myself. Nothing is currently fact but speculating a bit its very logical. Their current engine is getting old, PC technology is moving forward and its like you said, they have created quality titles and i don't believe they are just going to stop and put all efforts into micro-transactions and steam development only. It wouldn't make any sense for them to do that. I've read a couple of months ago that they have already started to prepare certain games for the source 2 engine as suggested by modders. (Specifically Dota modders)   Article here: http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/7/5978029/valve-source-2-engine-launch  It wouldn't make sense if they were to release a new sequel or title now, as its logical to assume that they are going to hold off for something next gen. I respect valve for doing things right, especially now when the gaming industry is massive and most publishers / developers out there are just trying to milk the players."
valve,2r12eu,xzaz,-3,Sat Jan 3 07:40:26 2015 UTC,"And before the annunciation of the Steam OS and controller the general idea was they would announce a new game in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Now they will of course in 2015.   No they will not, they will produce more in-game content, micro transactions and other shit that doesn't extends the games. They have focused there business away from creating big games. Why should they? Fans are creating new content for the HL universe, they just provide the platform, a engine."

Last I heard, they are spending a ton of time on DotA 2 as it's their biggest cash cow at the moment, with the rest of their time being spent on porting over all their AAA titles to the new engine, and optimized to really show off the new capabilities.   From my buddy who was last there a good 6 months ago to work on some community projects and long term strategy, he said 2015 is going to be a HUGE year for Valve and it's fans. Though, I have no idea if that's going to include HL3 or just the porting of TF2 and L4D on the new engine. Though, I wont doubt L4D3 should be done soon."

Last time I tried to bring up something I got downvoted to hell because I didn't have enough proof or what I just said is just not reasonable.... I was saying that DotA 2 was running off an optimized and customized version of Source 2... Literally, I was drowned in downvotes... Then a few months later, Valve unveils that DotA 2 is running a modified version of Source 2.   Though, word has it HL3 isn't looking very likely to be finished any time soon, which is why they are looking for other titles to finally allow them to launch the new engine. Apparently, it's hard finding a large team willing to tackle the game. For starters, it's been started over from scratch a huge number of times simply because HL3 has huge shoes to fill. This means devs are cautious to work on a game and have all their time and work wasted. Also, HL3 isn't going to be a money maker like many of the other games, so devs naturally are spending more of their time on money making titles.   Hence the reason there is so much more focus on porting existing games: The hardwork is already done. No worry about it getting scrapped. It's a proven game. No expectations to live up to. And games like TF2 are going to bring in those large bonuses."
valve,2r12eu,cunningmunki,1 point,Sat Jan 3 07:42:32 2015 UTC,I appreciate your time telling us! But why do you think that Valve thinks HL3 isn't a big money maker when it's literally the most anticipated and nostalgically missed game. It's so disappointing to hear that.
valve,2r12eu,Henry132,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"Well it'll definitely make money, that's for sure. However, it wont make the most money. Right now, DotA 2 and CS GO are making huge amounts of cash; far more than the HL franchise has ever brought in. Not only are they making huges amount of money with their F2P model, but are relatively simple to make in comparison to a AAA game.  And like I said, Valve doesn't have 100s of developers on standby. You'd be surprised how small they are. So they can't focus on everything at once.  However, on a positive light, they are working on something, and have been for a while. I suspect it's L4D3 and the L4D2/TF2 ports"

Now it just looks like a normal controller with 2 gimmick pads on it instead of something different."
valve,2phnuu,Better_MixMaster,4,Tue Dec 16 18:49:49 2014 UTC,I can't agree more. I can rationalize the buttons being there for older titles that may not like the pads but the stick feels wrong to me. My take on the original idea was to be done with the stick and have it replaced with the fully customizable pads. I hate software assisted movement and/or mouse acceleration as a whole.
valve,2phnuu,Buddhalobesz,5,Tue Dec 16 20:23:41 2014 UTC,"I got to try one of these at Valve and I think it really hits the balance between comfortably familiar, but improved over the traditional design.  The Chell model prototype (the one shipped with the Steambox beta) had problems with the buttons being in odd places, and the lack of a D-pad. A traditional controller has two sticks, four buttons, and a D-pad (in addition to the triggers of course). The Chell model had two pads, and eight buttons in a concentric square formation that was quite uncomfortable to use.  Here, the stick takes the place of the D-pad, and can be used by those who prefer it (I found it to be better for movement than the pad -- the right pad still feels as good as ever for freelook). The actions are still rebindable just as they were before, so you can eschew the stick completely if you so choose.  And it is a very welcome change to have the BAXY buttons in a familiar place."
valve,2phnuu,illuminatedgeek,1 point,Wed Dec 17 04:19:19 2014 UTC,"Thats good to hear. I'm glad to hear that it is still rebindable, I didn't think valve would remove it but its nice to have some amount of confirmation that its still there and probably still be there on launch."
valve,2phnuu,Buddhalobesz,3,Wed Dec 17 16:47:59 2014 UTC,"No, the stick has it's place. It has different behavior than a touch pad.   With touchpad, there always is the problem of finding the center position, so it is inaccurate for absolute input. Analog stick always resets itself into zero position when not used.  The touch pads will really shine for relative input (finger movement delta), emulating mouse, ""mouse"" look, etc. For absolute input (distance from center) this is somewhat problematic, as as soon as one touches the touchpad, it registers as input.

valve,2phnuu,volca02,1 point,Wed Dec 17 08:49:31 2014 UTC,"You make a good point, but I'm not convinced of the merits of the stick. My major issue is that I'm very used to raw mouse input, or unaccelerated mouse movement depending on what makes more sense in this context. The only way the stick works is with software assisted scrolling , I'm not sure what it is actually called but it the closest to what I think it would be called, where when you move the stick to one edge of the socket and hold it, your screen continues to scroll and usually at a faster speed than if you kept the stick away from the edge. I don't like that specifically but its necessary for the stick to be able to function, its just personal preference."

If they were confident that the pads could replace the standard button/stick they wouldn't need them instead its becoming less and less unique."

I believe there were cut references to how GLaDOS was doing her best to keep ""them"" out, but I can't verify it.   EDIT: Actually I can. Via the Half-Life wiki:   Throughout the fight, GLaDOS becomes increasingly distressed and enraged as her mental functions deteriorate, shouting insults and mockery at Chell. She insists that Chell would be better off simply allowing GLaDOS to kill her, making a vague allusion to the Combine invasion.   Portal 2 is supposed to take place sometime between a few hundred and 10,000 years in the future, as detailed in ""The Final Hours of Portal 2"". You also hear this similarly echoed by the announcer at the beginning of Portal 2, who glitches when stating the amount of time Chell has spent in the vault.   This was intentionally done to keep the events of Portal 2 and Half-Life 2/3 from interfering with each other, and to provide a simple answer as to why there's no Combine/civilization on the surface after Chell finally escapes.   Additionally, the Aperture Science Enrichment Center is located in Upper Michigan.   Sorry to shoot holes in your theories, but they don't fly."
valve,2pim3t,Slukaj,3,Wed Dec 17 19:28:54 2014 UTC,"Chell is a clone, literally a shell body. Portal 2s setting and ending were both deliberately ambiguous. The ending, especially, could have been even an afterlife vision - Elysium."

valve,2orudu,MEWOVER9000,13,Wed Dec 10 02:31:05 2014 UTC,"A highly anticipated TF2 update called ""End of the Line,"" based around a trailer for a fan made SFM film of the same name, was recently released along with said film.  Apparently (according to pre-release info) the update was to add several new weapons and a new map named ""Snowplow."" Now it seems the update added mainly cosmetic items, (including a new kind of killstreak mechanic involving a cosmetic duck requiring a purchase from the store,) a single weapon(purely cosmetic, no gameplay effect) and no map.  At least, I think that's what's happening. I admit I've only recently become aware of the update and the controvisy around it. Don't take my word as gospel."

valve,2orudu,Walnut156,2,Wed Dec 10 05:30:35 2014 UTC,"A very anticipated TF2 update ended up being a big cash grab. Valve said they would add a map called cp_snowplow to the game made by the community. Valve ended up going back on their word because ""it's confusing to new players."" People got really mad because they have much more confusing stuff in the game and they can mark how difficult a map is on the title screen."
valve,2orudu,weclock,3,Tue Dec 9 19:05:55 2014 UTC,You're missing the point. People have been looking forward to this update for over a year. The map had beta testing and everyone was very excited as valve almost never adds community maps (so the custom map community was also elated). Valve also made it sound like the community was responsible for the update when really they mainly use community stuff for updates.

valve,2nz0bk,treJmei,4,Tue Dec 2 03:11:19 2014 UTC,Captain Obvious saves the day.
valve,2nz0bk,ChubbiestThread,4,Tue Dec 9 17:26:56 2014 UTC,Just jizzed my pants in the chipotle line. Thanks.
valve,2nz0bk,Foxbatalion,13,Mon Dec 1 23:32:49 2014 UTC,"TF2 characters: I think the Heavy, Scout, and Soldier would all make sense to include. Spy and Medic's mechanics only work in team games, and Sniper and Engineer don't really lend themselves to 2D fighting games. Demoman and Pyro could work okay, I think. Half-Life: I'm not super-familiar with Half-Life. Gordon seems an obvious choice, along with maybe a Vortigaunt? Most of the characters don't seem especially actiony. Portal: None of the AI characters have any form that makes sense to have in the game. Chell could be included, but her known abilities are pretty much limited to shooting portals, which could be interesting in a 2D fighting game in a stage designed for it, but would require some serious balance work to make sense. I think it'd be more likely to just see a Portal stage with portals on it, rather than any characters from the series. Left 4 Dead: Most of the Special Infected would be good characters, except maybe the Boomer, for its self-destructive abilities. Charger, Spitter, Hunter, maybe even Tank and Witch, all seem like good options. Not sure about the Survivor characters; it could be cool to have a few of them with different abilities, but I don't know how much sense that makes when all of them are exactly the same in their original games. Counter-Strike: Counter-Terrorists Win. DOTA 2: I have no idea what DOTA characters are like but I'm sure there are tons of characters that could work very well in such a game."
valve,2nz0bk,Kill_Welly,16,Mon Dec 1 21:23:28 2014 UTC,GLaDOS as a Master Hand type boss character could work though.
valve,2nz0bk,Henry132,3,Mon Dec 1 21:35:07 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that could be done."
valve,2nz0bk,Kill_Welly,9,Mon Dec 1 21:35:33 2014 UTC,I could see spy having a kirby like ability of assuming other characters abilities.   Half Life could probably see Alyx and DOG as well as Gordon. Both are shown to be pretty actiony at times.   In Portal I could see the two robots from Co-op being played like the ice climbers
valve,2nz0bk,rashondala,2,Mon Dec 1 22:09:29 2014 UTC,"I've thought the same thing about the robots/ice climbers thing. I'd work, if you could figure out actual game play for them. The concept makes sense, but how exactly would you play them out? Would they actually use their portal guns? That's a lot for one person control."
valve,2nz0bk,Sprinkles0,1 point,Tue Dec 2 04:30:44 2014 UTC,"Have the player switch between the two robots, and while it sounds really hard to do practically, or even in the source engine, you could have the drones attach portals to surfaces, and jump out of them for moves like uppercuts and grabs. Also they could throw crates and debris pulled from portals offscreen."
valve,2nz0bk,atomic1fire,1 point,Tue Dec 2 10:35:36 2014 UTC,That's a interesting idea. It could work.
valve,2nz0bk,Sprinkles0,2,Tue Dec 2 17:21:05 2014 UTC,I can see Spy getting a counter move. quickly cloaks SEDUCE ME! stab
valve,2nz0bk,Kill_Welly,2,Tue Dec 2 15:27:15 2014 UTC,"I think we would get all the TF2 mercenaries, seeing how you pointed out the small amount of actual characters that Valve could use. I could see Spy's dead ringer or cloak being used, probably making him more of a fragile character. With any amount of work, the mercs could work"
valve,2nz0bk,gu3st12,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:33:23 2014 UTC,"They're all possible, if characters are necessary, but in some cases it could require pretty dramatic changes from the way the character is usually presented."
valve,2nz0bk,DScratch,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:34:39 2014 UTC,There's 108+ DOTA heroes. Some of the more memorable ones like Pudge or Techies would be a good addition.
valve,2nz0bk,LordNotix,1 point,Tue Dec 2 04:42:54 2014 UTC,"With a tweak of the portal gun mechanic you could use it to teleport, reflect attacks and summon assistance I.E. Open a portal to a room full of turrets that blast bullets for 1-2 seconds."
valve,2nz0bk,oreotiger,1 point,Tue Dec 2 10:22:41 2014 UTC,Demoman is the demoknight though? Put in the grenade launcher and you have a lot of potential.

valve,2nz0bk,MugenLP,1 point,Tue Dec 9 23:14:08 2014 UTC,"I could totally see Atlas and P-Body, the two robot playable characters from the multiplayer portion of Portal 2, function like a ""two characters in one"" character like the Ice Climbers."

valve,2nz0bk,atomic1fire,8,Tue Dec 2 02:17:36 2014 UTC,Dog comes to mind.
valve,2nz0bk,TimTheEskimo,6,Mon Dec 1 21:45:30 2014 UTC,"Gordon Freeman, Alyx Vance, all the TF2 classes, Chell, Atlas/P-Body, CS player with each skin being a different alternate, Left 4 Dead special infected, some Dota 2 characters (never played).   The more and more I think about this the more and more it might be hard for many of them to be too different because so many of them are just shooter characters. If you wanted to you could add WW2 soldiers from Day of Defeat or the Left 4 Dead regular characters but they all kinda just shoot guns like the CS guys except the L4D guys can use melee weapons.   Maybe this idea could work as a first person arena shooter similar to Overwatch or that Gearbox First Person MOBA."
valve,2nz0bk,Born2Folk,2,Tue Dec 2 00:50:04 2014 UTC,"Maybe cut down the maximum number of characters to say three in a game, with the extras being saved for dlc.  I think Heavy + Spy + Saxton Hale could work.  Atlas+P-body weaponizing objects off screen  and eachother through portals, occasionally pulling the random personality core. (I'M RICK) And a glados themed finisher.  Some cool fighter themed classes from dota, which I don't know much about.  Half life Zombie: Armed with claws, grenades, and friendly neighboorhood headcrabs, interested in punching, and brains. Ranged attacks consist of throwing headcrabs at people like pikmin, rolling or throwing grenades, and a finisher that consists of changing into a fast zombie and running around much faster and worse.  Gordon with gravity gun and crowbar, obviously. with some guns for ranged stuff.  D0g for the strong class of half life. Maybe he'd play fetch with rollarmines.  I think you could roughly get about 10 fighters in the game just with valve properties. Unless you include some little known guys like richochet and ww2 dudes.  Maybe Classic TF characters could be added as filler somewhere. Like the original heavy. Maybe as a joke secret character, the civilian from the original team fortress could be added, I don't know a good moveset though.  I think you could get 13 characters maybe if you dug around, more if valve decided to work with other gaming companies to add other characters from other franchises popular on steam."

valve,2nz0bk,falconzord,1 point,Mon Dec 1 22:26:11 2014 UTC,"Gordon: Crowbar attacks, gravity gun object throw, controlled rocket launcher attack, finisher involving driving a car right into the opponent.  Heavy: Punches, shotgun, throw, Natasha, Heavy + medic overdrive finisher where heavy fires his machine gun in one direction while invulnerable.  Nihilanth: scaled down boss from half life 1, able to fire electrical orbs, and for the sake of fighting game, swap through various aliens as fighting game characters. Headcrab can leap onto a player and do some small damage until pulled off, fast zombie is capable of melee, vortigaunt is able to fire electrical bolts, and the finisher involves the nihilanth attacking. For a throw maybe a ichthyosaur/antlion could pop up from under ground and snap someone knocking them into the sky.  Portal bots: Two bots controlled by glados that work like the ice climbers, able to throw objects and teleport turrets onto the field, in addition to having some melee skills that include a portal uppercut, hitting people with their portal gun, and high fiving eachother after a successful win. Finisher would presumably be glados filling the stage with a short lived poison.  Father Gregori: This crazed psycopath from ravenholm is at it again, only he's created some new mobile death traps to fight whatever congregation is out there. He also has his trademark shotgun for close range assailents. Able to throw traps, and as a finisher has a swarm of spinning blades fly through the arena while he laughs.  Combine Super Soldier: Based on Combine Elite concept art, this guy is armed with a plasma rifle and for melee carries two stun batons. Can call on an advisor for a pretty nasty finisher.   I think I've pretty much run out of ideas for characters that might work, plus I would be terrible at balancing a fighting game.  Possible DLC: Companies that would be willing to loan valve unconventional fighting game characters. e.g that evil dragonborn from skyrim."

Part of the Duke Nukem issue was that the game was passed around between studios, and shelved/rebooted multiple times. Half-Life 3 has a very steady dev cycle, and it's being babied.

valve,2mh8iw,sharpie660,1 point,Mon Nov 17 14:07:15 2014 UTC,"That may have been part of the issue with Forever, but the main problem was that it took so long to make and gathered so much hype that nothing could live up to it. Their aloofness over the whole thing isn't helping either, despite what they may think.

valve,2m0cwq,mykal17,2,Tue Nov 11 22:10:16 2014 UTC,"A spirit? For such a sci-fi series, even one with the vortigaunt's spirituality in it, I doubt it. The Vorts' abilities always seemed to be explainable through it being a form of psychic or higher dimensional sensitivity.  Also, the likelihood that the Combine Empire is somehow a bit player seems wrong. The Nihilanth was a refugee who's threat could be destroyed with a single death. The Combine is an empire spanning dozens, if not hundreds, if not thousands of worlds. The idea that they're going to be dealt with, just to throw yet another villain into the series seems wrong.   He says Gordon's going to just ""beat"" the Combine. Does he mean the Combine forces on Earth, or destroying the entire empire? If the former, then we have a huge power still in play, and in the latter, we have such a incredible power being destroyed as just a sideshow for the real villain.  How are you supposed to make a game about fighting incorporeal beings, who's ""agents"" are most likely also incorporeal, when the main focus of gameplay is shooting. Or are they going to have a be a last minute development for a final game, because then it seems like a cheap twist.  I have my own theory though, so I may be being unfairly harsh due to it competing with my own."

valve,2m0cwq,PrinceCheddar,3,Wed Nov 12 12:06:04 2014 UTC,"I agree that the G-man (or at least, the image he presents himself as) is most likely non-corporal. Some kind of psychic projection.  Would you be interested in hearing my opposing theory?"
valve,2m0cwq,Lord_Haringoth,3,Wed Nov 12 15:47:34 2014 UTC,I'm interested in hearing your theory.
valve,2m0cwq,PrinceCheddar,1 point,Wed Nov 12 19:07:27 2014 UTC,Certainly.
valve,2m0cwq,PrinceCheddar,3,Wed Nov 12 21:24:53 2014 UTC,"My theory is that the crystals that grow in Xen are actually a form of sentient life. The ""G-man"" is one of these crystals, specifically the one that caused the resonance cascade, with the image of the suit wearing man being a way for it to communicate telepathically with humans.  First of all, you have the crystals themselves, used in the resonance cascade and in teleportation technology. That means they are capable of affecting reality, warping time and space. G-man is similarly able to manipulate time and space, teleporting others and keeping people in stasis, as well as being able to affect the minds of others. (Alyx) Add the fact that it was the G-man himself who presented Black Mesa with the crystal, (that disappears after the test goes wrong) and it fits rather well.  It also gives some explanation about his motivations. Originally, the Nihilanth fled to Xen to escape the Combine. The Nihilanth and its forces then began using the crystals for technology and the Nihilanth used them to heal itself during its fight with Gordon. This is likely an undesirable situation for the crystals, probably akin to torture. So the G-man was sent to Earth to set off the resonance cascade. Either the Nihilanth would leave Xen after conquering Earth, or Earth would win and kill the Nihilanth, probably being very cautious of future teleportation technology. In both cases, the crystals are no longer being messed with and the G-man fulfills his goals.  However, the G-man couldn't have foreseen that his actions would result in Earth becoming a target for the Combine, and presumably the crystals are potentially facing even worse conditions than before. We've seen on Earth that the Combine are the masters of draining all usable resources from an occupied territory.  Hence why the G-man goes from throwing humanity under the bus with the Nihilanth to orchestrating its uprising. Better humanity grow strong than the oppressive regime of the Combine be uncontested. At least humanity may be reasoned with, eventually.  These crystals may be psychic and able to affect time and space, but they are vulnerable. Gordon destroyed three in his final battle of HL1. The Nihilanth was capable of using them for its own purposes. Presumably, they are ill equipped to fight any real enemy head on. The crystal at the beginning of Half-Life was noted for being especially pure, so that could account for why that one was chosen to perform the required tasks. This explains not only why the G-man works so indirectly, but why he works so secretly. It's possible the Combine are currently unaware of the true nature of the crystals. The G-man must work subtly in order for the Combine to never investigate him and discover the truth. Who knows what deadly precortions they would take to eliminate this potential threat.  So, why did the Vorts work against him in HL2:Ep1?  The G-man sets up Gordon by putting him in a position where he can help bring about the defeat of the Combine. At the end of Half-Life 2, Gordon had completed his mission in sparking the revolution, so the G-man was ready to take him somewhere/somewhen else where he would be next be most effective.  It's a risk reward calculation. The G-man thought leaving Gordon on Earth was too great a risk for what little it helped achieve for the greater good. The vorts disagreed, so they forced the Gordon to stay. At first, the G-man was angry that he wasn't able to follow through with his original decision, but once he realized the gamble was paying off he decided to roll with it and allow events to unfold.  As for the term ""employers,"" I think that it's a way for the G-man to say something has no English equivalent. He's not used to communicating through sound (or the illusion of sound) and there's no simple way of saying: ""collection of sentient psychic crystalline entities of which I have been selected as agent of due to being the purest, and so most powerful individually"" that really works. Add the fact that he'd want to deliberately be vague, and you it's obvious why the G-man would use the word ""employers.""  More or less."

I know valve isnt a conventional company but this would be a step too far for them, there has to be a game"
valve,2kkn1k,blacktags,5,Tue Oct 28 22:33:45 2014 UTC,"My guess is that they've ramped down HL3 production when they hired Icefrog, to focus on dota2, steamOS hardware, Linux, etc instead. The engine creation guys at valve stayed on the source2 team as source was 90% good enough for dota2s needs already. As source2 wasn't ready for dota2, and without enough hl3 content for the engine guys to test code on, they decided to use older source games to continue fleshing source2 out.   Sadly I think this means we have at least 2-3 more years until the next installment of half life, or major release period if valve doesn't aquire another turtlerock studios or find a new group of portal college students.   -My zero industry experience, valve news junkie, wild speculation."

valve,2k5eho,H4h4h4h4hh4,3,Fri Oct 24 20:35:45 2014 UTC,"Unless they have a way to batch/automatically convert content from games like CSGO/TF2 there is no reason to kill the community and move them to Source 2. The 2 engines (From what we've seen on DOTA2) operate differently in matters of VIS and lighting.  Just my 2 cents on the matter. I do also agree with the top comment, no reason to ride the wave.

valve,2jk2g8,zastels,1 point,Sat Oct 18 01:38:51 2014 UTC,"I like the concept, but the delivery needs work. Your swearing feels forced. And If you're going to rant about something, make sure the video segment under your rant audio is relevant.   Also, be wary of criticizing aspects of the game that you as a player just don't understand. For example, your complaint about the nav arrow, while legitimate, isn't a large enough complaint for the amount of time you spent on it. Nav arrows like that have been around since GTA3. GPS nav arrows can take away from the freedom of games like this. A general ""this direction"" arrow allows you to explore ""shortcut"" paths. Think Burnout Paradise, for example.  Also, I'm pretty sure the trains have signal indicators on the roadway, which you chose to ignore, and got clobbered by a train. This goes along with the freedom argument, train got in your way, find another way around quickly so you don't lose your target. It's 80's action movie all the way.  One last point, this is posted in the wrong sub. This game doesn't have anything to do with Valve outside of the distribution platform. Try /r/letsplay for a proper direction where it should go."

valve,2hodso,Whynotpie,10,Sat Oct 4 22:44:48 2014 UTC,"It's not been updated at all in a long time. It's fun, but Valve seems to ignore that it exists."
valve,2hodso,gu3st12,1 point,Sun Sep 28 05:46:57 2014 UTC,There is still people creating new maps.
valve,2hodso,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Sun Sep 28 18:16:52 2014 UTC,People is still doing that? Why does people still do that if there are nobody that play the game?

valve,2hodso,Dirtydirtdirtt,-1,Mon Sep 29 01:37:13 2014 UTC,What's the joke?
valve,2hodso,Dirtydirtdirtt,5,Mon Sep 29 03:28:41 2014 UTC,It's a great game. I preferred it to CS:S.
valve,2hodso,thejumbles,1 point,Mon Sep 29 10:52:02 2014 UTC,What is the difference?
valve,2hodso,thejumbles,5,Sun Sep 28 11:51:33 2014 UTC,In CS you die and that's it for the round. In DoD you respawn just behind the frontline. If the two sides are evenly matched it makes for prolonged and intense gun battles as you try to push the enemy back.
valve,2hodso,Servious,1 point,Sun Sep 28 16:40:47 2014 UTC,"Its based in WWII and you don't buy weapons, you select a class and a side."

valve,2hodso,enthreeoh,4,Sun Sep 28 17:10:36 2014 UTC,"A little bit. The only difference in the classes in Day of Defeat is the weapons. Not health or speed or anything. Also health levels are a lot lower, so it's a bit more like Call of Duty. Unlike Call of Duty, however, it's a lot more tactical."
valve,2hodso,Dirtydirtdirtt,2,Sun Sep 28 18:46:18 2014 UTC,"Well I thought it was fucking brilliant, I played it for years and years. Fast and exciting game play, no fucking around waiting for an entire round to finish (like CS:GO or a lot of other FPS games) just quick waves from the spawn, decent objectives, very well laid out and balanced maps, balanced classes, very smooth running engine (easy to max out FPS etc).  I only stopped just recently because of the dwindling numbers in the servers (NZ/Australasia), and that the remaining (clan) servers were full of hammer-happy mods/members that would kick you for petty reasons like having a name they don't like, or 'evading enemy fire' (literally, there's a server than kicks and bans you for evading their shots - talk about spoilt child syndrome).  I might get back into it soon, I'm missing it sorely. Every now and then a decent public server fills up which is fun."
valve,2hodso,TheWac0Kid,1 point,Sun Sep 28 20:18:26 2014 UTC,"It's a great game that was never properly supported by valve. It came to source without many features that its predecessor had, such as maps, weapons, and even an entire team being left out. Instead of getting many new and original maps over time, valve incorporated some community made maps into the distribution but overall they never invested much development into it after release."

valve,2hgk5r,danbuter,4,Thu Sep 25 19:43:08 2014 UTC,"Once purchased on steam, you can play on any OS it supports. This is true even if the game only supported windows at the time of your purchase and only released for Linux later on.  As for purchases counting as Linux purchases, you must play it on Linux first and within a week of purchase. If you already played it on windows, or purchased it more than a week ago without playing, it will count as a windows purchase.  Source: there was an AMA about a month ago with someone from Aspyr (or something like that) who ported games to Linux"
valve,2hgk5r,incompleteness_theor,4,Thu Sep 25 19:53:52 2014 UTC,"Your answer contradicts itself, and I'm still confused."
valve,2hgk5r,incompleteness_theor,7,Thu Sep 25 20:05:43 2014 UTC,"No, it doesn't. I just answered two questions since your post isn't clear.  If a game on steam supports linux, you can play it. Period.  If you are concerned about your purchase counting as a linux purchase (as far as OS statistics is concerned, as used by Steam and developers for various reasons), it's too late unless you purhased it less than a week ago and haven't played it on Windows."
valve,2hgk5r,antiduh,4,Thu Sep 25 20:16:57 2014 UTC,"Ok, gotcha. I didn't realize you meant that you were referring to some kind of metric showing popularity."
valve,2hgk5r,incompleteness_theor,4,Thu Sep 25 20:38:36 2014 UTC,"I was so confused too, I thought for a minute he was saying that once you played the game on a given platform for more than a week, it was locked to that platform, which was counter to my own experience.  So yes, you buy the game and can play it on as many platforms as you want, given that the game supports running on that platform."

valve,2heaon,JackWilfred,2,Thu Sep 25 13:33:27 2014 UTC,"That's pretty insane, but I think it's down to how Steam handles DLC. Because it's labelled as such, Steam assumes it's just normal DLC, and why would you download normal DLC if you didn't have the base game?"

But, in the end, I knew it was a long-shot, and their ""rejection"" was not surprising. While I think I'm good at what I do, I don't think I'm Valve-quality good. Not yet. They encouraged me to keep pushing, and to re-apply. They specifically told me that most people who apply to Valve don't get a job from the first application. They do the things Valve suggests, and re-apply. I've decided that, while working for Valve would still be a dream come true, I personally won't be ready to re-apply for a couple more years, and I've been perfecting my craft for 8 years now."

valve,2f8aws,Soapuel,8,Tue Sep 2 09:20:10 2014 UTC,You are the first person I have seen (besides myself) who would rather have Left 4 Dead 3 over Half Life 3. I really think Left 4 Dead 3 will be one of the most amazing Co-op games ever.
valve,2f8aws,dudeface-,3,Tue Sep 2 14:00:12 2014 UTC,"I do like Half Life and Portal etc, but the games I spent most time in are Dota and Left4Dead 2 obviously thats the nature of multiplayer games.  It's a no brainer which one I would prefer, but I wouldn't have a cry if they didn't deliver my preferred franchise like some people will."
valve,2f8aws,WRB852,2,Tue Sep 2 14:09:56 2014 UTC,How do you know Half Life 3 won't have an amazing coop experience packaged with it? I think I remember valve saying that they will no longer release only single player games.

valve,2f8aws,manudanz,1 point,Tue Sep 2 15:46:24 2014 UTC,This was a hint a long time ago that they weren't going to do a HL3.  But I believe they might have changed their mind as a ton of people want it.   This is a no brainer cash cow.
valve,2f8aws,RealmBreaker,1 point,Wed Sep 3 02:05:13 2014 UTC,"I believe the HL3 you are reffering to is Half-Life 2: Episode 3, which was slated to come out a year after ep2 but has now been believed to have just become HL3 due to unknown reasons."
valve,2f8aws,XboxWigger,-1,Sun Sep 7 20:54:42 2014 UTC,I think Half Life 3 is going to be a massive game.  It will probably be an open world RPGish game with Portal mixed in with it.  They will also have a VR version/addition to the game.  I also see it being heavy on multiplayer.  The game will be updated with new content just like TF2 and Dota and CS GO
valve,2f8aws,Stikanator,5,Sat Sep 6 19:47:19 2014 UTC,"There won't be a new CS,TF2 or Dota that's for sure! But.. It's very likely they will be ported to source 2"

valve,2f8aws,McKilled,3,Tue Sep 2 12:00:22 2014 UTC,"I think its a good formula for multiplayer games not to make a sequel every 2-3 years..  Look at WoW, Q3/QuakeLive, ... as well   These are games are games where the core has been stabilized and perfectionilized (if that's even a word) with continuous support and updates(as long as they can keep the money flowing in to be able to make the updates offcourse). They get to keep the community instead of splitting it up with each iteration (think CS 1.6, CS:CZ, CS:S, CS:GO) I think with CS:GO they finally got it down :)  A new iteration would be good when they can make a game with significant changes."
valve,2f8aws,Stikanator,2,Tue Sep 2 12:51:57 2014 UTC,"They won't have a new Cs for a looong time, the competitive scene is still growing."
valve,2f8aws,yourstru1y,7,Tue Sep 2 19:44:00 2014 UTC,"I think that games are like music and movies. You dont have to release 1 every year. Its just the wrong mindset to have when people stop playing a game because its old or start playing one because its new. If its fun, it will be timeless. Having dota2 and CSGO together with valves support is more than enough for me IMO  Plus remours of them getting ported to source2 is pure jizz"
valve,2f8aws,AniGamor,3,Tue Sep 2 16:41:48 2014 UTC,"I can get that mindset. It's just that you figure a company as large as valve could have more than one team working on different projects. If what Blackops606 says it's true though, I guess they are in a bit of internal struggle and may have a difficult time rationing stuff."
valve,2f8aws,iwasazombie,28,Tue Sep 2 17:07:52 2014 UTC,"""When it's done.""   Valve doesn't release a bunch of crap, Portal 2 came out in 2011, Global Offensive came out in 2012.  DOTA2 was released last year. There was just a source 3 engine update that they are testing.  They are working on Steam box to get steam games to the peasants.  They are also administering steam and trying to figure out how to police developers and the community.  I would expect an information release and a possible game this year.  Possibly a new left4dead game."

valve,2f8aws,atomic1fire,7,Tue Sep 2 13:57:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but it's not even their release schedule that I'm complaining about. It's that they aren't communicating any semblance of plans of content to their consumers."
valve,2f8aws,Ganonmaster,11,Tue Sep 2 05:26:50 2014 UTC,"Everyone wants to know what a new Half Life or Left 4 Dead game will be like, but if they would start showing screenshots or video today and the game wouldn't be out for another two years, what good will it do? Team Fortress 2 was announced in 1999 but the game wouldn't be out until 2007 and was basically an entirely different game compared to what they showed initially. You only get to make a first impression once, so you want to nail it down. Don't promise your fanbase anything until you're sure it's close to being done. Of course it's frustrating for the fans to be left in the dark. Stonewalling people on this subject could give the impression that a game is in development hell. But it gives them more flexibility to work on a project and really experiment with everything they do without having to show their hand. They're unpredictable, but it fits with their corporate structure and usually results in quality games.  At least, that's where I think they're coming from. Gabe Newell or Doug Lombardi might have mentioned something about this very subject at some point, but I can't seem to find it right now. I don't really like the way they're communicating their plans (ie. not at all), but it seems to work for them. They're also doing things a little bit different when it comes to the Steam OS stuff, so they're at least trying other approaches."
valve,2f8aws,atomic1fire,8,Tue Sep 2 08:30:18 2014 UTC,"But on the other hand, valve has the advantage of surprise.  They could release the game tomorrow and everyone would crap themselves in anticipation.  They could throw some crowbars in tf2 and it would hit the reddit frontpage.  Valve has become so mysterious that people can't stop talking about them.  I mean at the worst their fanbase is a satirical cult of personality revolving around gaben, and not really a whole lot of companies can say that they have a core audience that can't stop advertising for them."
valve,2f8aws,ofabx,3,Tue Sep 2 10:36:22 2014 UTC,"However, we're starting to see levels of hype that are impossible to live up to. And Valve hasn't said a single thing about Half Life 3. It could potentially bite them in the ass when it doesn't live up to be the equivalent of the second coming of Jesus Christ. Not that I don't agree with you, it's just that the sword cuts both ways."
valve,2f8aws,isdevilis,3,Tue Sep 2 15:20:19 2014 UTC,"Valve has been pretty good about a high standard of quality.  They don't release something until they're happy with it.  They hire people who are really good at what they do.  They're willing and able to respond to their fans and they always have a high amount of quality on whatever they do.  Most people figure that they won't release half life 3 until source 2 is officially released.  It makes sense given that they'll need a big game to sell the engine to other developers and perhaps sell steam OS as a debut game. (they already said it won't be a exclusive, but Linux support right away would probably boost steam OS.)"

valve,2f8aws,mrlint,2,Tue Sep 2 17:11:40 2014 UTC,"Everything is pretty hush-hush right now.  There is so much speculation that it can be hard to wrap your head around it all.  What I do know is that around the Steam Box getting rolling, a bunch of people either left or were let go from Valve.  I noticed a good chunk of them went to Amazon actually and one guy works as a bartender for what I think might be co-owned by him.  What does this mean?  I'm not too sure.  The two things that stick out to me are 1. Valve could have let them go to hire more hardware related people to push out the Steam Box and similar things  2. The employees didn't like the change/direction Valve has/had been taking and decided to move on.  You could also look into other things such as Amazon or any company opening a new facility or possibly giving better employee perks.  While I'm sure Valve has great healthcare and pay, there can usually be more.  Anyways, game development takes a long time.  We could actually be seeing ""Source 2"" or a new engine along with several new games coming from Valve in the next few years but its really hard to tell right now.  I've always said that they need to call it ____ 3 (engine) and ship something like HL EP3/HL3, L4D3, and some other smaller game and market it as ""See?  We can count to three!""  It would be HUGE for them and would get the entire internet going crazy."

valve,2f8aws,stickflip,1 point,Thu Sep 4 15:20:53 2014 UTC,They will release something this year. One game a year has been Valve's mantra.

In it states:   LambdaGeneration confirmed this in an email to Valve’s Doug Lombardi earlier, who said that there will be no press or public showings planned this year and only business related meetings will be taking place."

Honestly, I doubt that would happen as all of those are more than big enough to stand on their own. Orange Box was primarily bringing Half Life 2 + Episodes to consoles, as well as TF2 and Portal (which they didn't believe would take off).  Besides, of all the leaked stuff we've seen, doesn't really seem to have been any mention of Portal 3, reckon that's probably a ways off, after L4D3 and Half-Life 3."

valve,2dblaz,flashmozzg,1 point,Tue Aug 12 19:53:22 2014 UTC,"Not happening. They are not idiots. They bundled portal because they didn't think it would ""take off"" on it's own (maybe they were right). They didn't expect such popularity. TF2 - just because they needed playerbase.

Basically, there's a company in Malaysia called Animedia who have a big warehouse. What they do is download torrents of films, games etc. and then burn them onto discs. They also print covers on the discs and for the boxes. They then distribute them to stores all over Malaysia and tourists think they're getting really good deals, when really they aren't. It all looks really legit, but it's actually not and technically it's illegal but for some reason this company still exists and nothing is being done about them. It's the same for most things like clothes, bags, shoes, toys etc. in SE Asia though. Most of the countries are run on counterfeiting and piracy. Hollywood is worried about the average internet user torrenting and then you've got Animedia over here actually making profit from their content and giving none of it back. Big film companies should really be concentrating on them more than us."

I've done a little modding myself for Red Orchestra 2 in a pretty small team and I can attest to the fact that it really is hard work.  But on the other hand, I'm afraid this will start a new trend of selling mods as DLC. I really, REALLY hope this doesn't become a trend with most games and that we can continue enjoying free content from the community.  I hope that mods being sold are of extremely high quality.  Anyway, this ""mod"" (not sure if we can really call it a mod at this point) looks well worth the cash, so I do plan on picking it up sometime in the future."
valve,2aso6l,Moskeeto93,4,Tue Jul 15 23:06:14 2014 UTC,I wouldn't mind this if it encourages more game developers to add in modding tools and the price point of said mods\dlc's are fair. Someone just needs to do a Louis C.K. and set the price bar low.
valve,2aso6l,lucidnz,2,Wed Jul 16 04:20:36 2014 UTC,I'm in a sort of mixed attitude as well.  Although I'm happy high quality mods are being sold (blackmesa and this. ) I don't want it to start a trend.  Mods being turned into an advertising tool is the last thing I'd want to see.
valve,2aso6l,holben,2,Wed Jul 16 05:34:58 2014 UTC,"But on the other hand, I'm afraid this will start a new trend of selling mods as DLC.   On another hand on top of that hand, they'd have to put out good, free (with the purchase of the game) mod tools to make that possible, and they couldn't do that while also charging people to play mods in general (as in, free mods would still exist).   As long as there's still a rather large barrier to entry for selling mods (Aperture Tag seems to add a large amount of its own content with good quality, and Black Mesa is as big as HL1), I don't have a big objection to modders having the option to sell their work. If you needed to pay for"
valve,2aso6l,NeoKabuto,2,Wed Jul 16 19:25:35 2014 UTC,"In it's defense, Aperture Tag is basically a completely new game (aside from needing portal 2) with its own campaign and such. We've also seen Valve sell previous mods that they felt were worth the money. Garry's Mod for instance is still one of the best selling games that is used for everything from random stupid fun to creating even more games within said game..."
valve,2aso6l,dorn3,1 point,Wed Jul 16 10:09:06 2014 UTC,"Agree with all the points you touched on.  I think this is a great model of rewarding those who put a lot of hard work and love into their mods. Mods like Aperture Tag or even Minerva and Black Mesa are ones I would gladly pay for for.  Anything smaller in scope and if charging money, the price should be reflective of the value of the content. I'm curious if the Aperture Tag team decided themselves and if so how, for the $7 price point, or if Valve helped by providing access to their economists. It just seems like a weird price, would have expected it to be $5 or $10 flat."
valve,2aso6l,Galgus,1 point,Fri Jul 18 18:43:39 2014 UTC,Mods will become far better if they can be sold.  We're already seeing this in games like Planetside.  I'm of the opposite opinion.  I'd rather spend 100's of dollars on good mods and create an ecosystem of good content.
valve,2aso6l,deadcat5566,1 point,Sat Jul 19 12:30:15 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't mind paying for high quality mods if it meant more of them got released.  I've never been much of a modder, but I followed an amazing RA3 mod that died to to massive issues with the engine after a long time, though the community had fun in betas and discussions.  On a related note, I hope that companies will make an effort to make their games easier to mod: though RA3 was of course an EA thing."
valve,2aso6l,atomic1fire,7,Wed Jul 30 20:10:54 2014 UTC,Reading the reviews makes me think this is not something worthy of putting in the store for 6 bucks. But it's kind of weird since Valve allowed the game to be sold...
valve,2aso6l,rawros,2,Wed Jul 16 04:35:38 2014 UTC,"On the other hand, It's probably far cheaper for them to charge six bucks for a mod that already exists then to work on portal 3.  Expansion packs aren't unheard of.  Also if you want a portal 2 mod that's free you should check out thinking with time machine.  Edit: Now that I actually got sort of far into thinking with time machine I can say that the game crashes after borealis, so maybe steam workshop is the better choice for portal 2 maps. Edit2 Looks like verifying the cache for both the mod and portal 2 fixed that crash, but it's still less portaly then portal 2."
valve,2aso6l,TheMisterAce,4,Wed Jul 16 04:42:09 2014 UTC,Looks far better than a few games being sold on Steam.

valve,2aso6l,HgFin,2,Wed Jul 16 02:09:05 2014 UTC,"The trading cards and badge are new to the mod. Co-op is likely using Portal 2's system. At the moment, Aperture Tag does not have its own workshop."

valve,2aso6l,Todd_the_odd,3,Wed Jul 16 06:22:52 2014 UTC,"afaik it runs on the portal-branch of the source engine (because it uses world portals). they probably had a different deal, because it doesn't require anything else to run. they might have just licensed the engine itself."
valve,2aso6l,lord_blex,1 point,Wed Jul 16 13:01:06 2014 UTC,"But isn't Source open source? So that makes it a bit different? If I'm right in thinking, that would mean they are sing it for what Valve want right?"
valve,2aso6l,Oooch,3,Wed Jul 16 16:31:12 2014 UTC,"I think how it works is that you can do anything with source, as long as you offer your product for free. if you want to charge for it, you have to work out a deal with valve. I don't think there is any info about this out there, it's entirely up to the dev and valve. but selling it as a mod is probably cheaper than as a standalone title (like stanley)."

The whole reason Dota even exists in the first place is WC3's modding support.

For them to give you the money back means that Valve takes a hit in transaction fees, the developer takes a hit, and the developer's trust in Valve takes a hit (unless Valve doesn't take the money back from the dev and takes a bigger hit).  While you might think that it might be amenable to Valve if they refund you in steam market credit, so that there's no net loss to them, it feels like it'd be unfair to the developer to do so.

valve,292bga,SparkyMcSparks_,4,Wed Jun 25 16:59:58 2014 UTC,"That's more or less what I got as a reply, so yeah I think it's always valuable to occur with a company."
valve,292bga,Slukaj,3,Wed Jun 25 17:43:19 2014 UTC,"Recently applied as well but for Level Design -- yet to hear back not even a no or automated message (although that seems like a standard in game companies now). I did get a tour last week from a friend of a family member that works there due to coincidental timing of me visiting the area, can share some stuff he told me as I didn't sign an NDA but still respectful not to bring up any potential sensitive stuff (not that there was any really but eh).  First as /u/Becer said and the tour guide as well, read the Handbook from their website.  I also found this interview with one of Valve's economics personnel very insightful into the hiring process (some of the information in the interview the tour guide covered as well): http://www.econtalk.org/archives/_featuring/yanis_varoufaki/  From what I remember during the tour, Valve interviews hundreds of candidates for a single opening. Even then, a lot don't make it past the lunch break into the second half. But that isn't to sound intimidating, because they will try to help steer you back on course if you genuinely are willing to correct yourself.  The work being done there is prestigious, but equally more important, if not more, is the culture. Even if you work on Lord of the Rings movies or a ""AAA"" game, if you don't fit their culture of working without a boss and being self-sufficient, they'll end the interview as to be as forthcoming with you as possible and not needlessly continue the interview for the sake of their time. I don't know if it's something you can learn to do, but should come instinctively, or so the audio interview linked above says.  The head-hunting hiring style you may have heard about when doing your research online is true, but even if you apply on their website, the thing they look for is if you are adding value to the projects you work on. It may take a week or it may take a year to hear back.  You don't even need to necessarily make something on a Source engine title, because if you are just making something for an application to wow them, it will be obvious what your intentions are the harder you try. As long as you are passionate about what you are making and there is value in it for being fun, that really stands out and they'll take notice -- plus that passion should be able to transfer over to their environment. The tour guide told me about a mod someone had made, and two employees had played in their free time and liked it so much they brought that person in for an interview on the whim.  I felt pretty good when I sent my application in since I'm regularly making mods and supporting other modders with tools / tutorials in my free time for CoD, plus I work on that same game franchise professionally as a career (not that I don't like it as I grew up playing and modding it, but Valve is more inline with what I want for myself as a designer and consumer since I've grown). But after getting that tour and talking with the Valve person, I feel like I still have (and always will) have some more learning to do so I'll just continue making more content in my free time and if someday my phone rings from Valve because they saw something in what I can add to their company...   Anyhow, good luck with your application if you try again. I'll probably ping them later in the year when I feel ready again. I did a lot of research before applying to make sure I was prepared, but even then, there isn't a lot of information out there but rightfully so because they want you to just be yourself if you interview or talk to them because that's what they want to see and not someone who is putting on a mask just to get the job. The tour guide and I had a blast talking about our favorite TF2 hats, the audio in Portal 2, raising children since we're both fathers, and the horrible traffic in Seattle.  Also, don't take anything I wrote above as quotes from the person I spoke to, I did a lot of paraphrasing and my own interpretation from what I remember. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk in case I left anything out or if you had a specific question the tour guide might have covered with me that I can share with you."

valve,292bga,AD7GD,2,Fri Jun 27 23:07:15 2014 UTC,"Question:  I'm an American, so I'm not familiar with your schools; is EPITA an actual IT school, or something closer to a CS or CE school?  Because if you're studying IT (like, tech support IT), then you may have a fighting chance. Valve only hires native foreign language speakers to man their support staff, and since you're French...   Try that route. If you want to actually make games, it's not what you'd actually like to do, but Valve seems to have a lot of horizontal movement, so it's a foot in the door."
valve,292bga,Slukaj,1 point,Thu Jun 26 15:09:43 2014 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the CS or CE acronyms, could you tell me what they mean ? EPITA is forming IT engineers, and all we do is IT related. Not only development, but also project management, and lots of algorithmic.  And I don't want to only make games with them, I'm very unsure at the moment about what I'll do when I'm older. For the moment, anything IT related would be great, because I love what they do.  Thanks for your input though !"

valve,28fff4,DallasOCat,7,Wed Jun 18 02:58:45 2014 UTC,"Opening a ticket is the only way to talk to them about it.   If you're certain not so much as a file used in cheats has touched your HDD, then it's one of two things - someone got your account info somehow and cheated (either through phishing, or a friend / family member) and now you're banned. It usually takes 2-4 weeks for a ban to occur from the trigger happening.  The other option is the extremely rare event where a bug in a game triggers VAC and a whole bunch of people get banned - but this has only happened something like 3 times in Steam's history and is always rectified."
valve,28fff4,Secret7000,0,Wed Jun 18 09:33:55 2014 UTC,"Sigh, thanks for the info. I have two questions though: does the vac ban spread to other games like tf2 and source engine games and can this ever happen from a virus? I am afraid to touch other multiplayer games because of this ban. Should I format all of my hdds and start with fresh windows but on the same steam account to get rid any possible viruses? I have a lot of items in csgo and tf2 so I want to keep them if possible. Thanks again for the info"
valve,28fff4,Secret7000,2,Wed Jun 18 19:42:28 2014 UTC,"does the vac ban spread to other games like tf2 and source engine games and can this ever happen from a virus?   A VAC ban on one game using VAC will ban you from all other games that use VAC too (eg, get banned in TF2, banned in CS:GO as well). I'm not an authority on the subject but I don't recall viruses triggering VAC bans (but maybe a virus harvested your login details?)   Should I format all of my hdds and start with fresh windows but on the same steam account to get rid any possible viruses?   Formatting is sensible, but that won't restore your account from the ban unfortunately. Certainly format before making a new account and reinstalling your Steam games. You have to understand why the anti-cheat system is strict. I feel for you, but I don't think there's a way back.   Worth noting is that being VAC-banned does not stop you from playing online entirely, but you can't play on VAC-enabled servers any more."

Valve also posted about a Moonbase update recently and there have been hints of a ""bread"" update as well. I personally think they're the same update, related in some way.  There's also a second update called ""End of the Line"", which will be the release of a video (not the same as the shortfilm) made by the community as well as a new map based on said video and possibly some cosmetic items. As far as we know, End of the Line isn't done yet so it's unlikely this will involve it.  More information:   Bread update Moonbase update End of the Line update TF2 short film"

valve,27rey1,conorf1807,3,Tue Jun 10 06:19:53 2014 UTC,"You clearly have no knowledge of how game development works, nor how valve works as a developer. First of Valve doesn't only make games, they have the extensive Steam system, which is widely used and so requires a lot of support. Secondly, they have released SteamOS which was a pretty big project, and so I'd imagine took a lot of manpower. And third, they are currently developing Steam machines and the Steam controller. And then there's Source 2, which is massive. Also games do not have to be frequent in order for a developer to be successful. Valve are often seen as better than developers like Activision who push a new Call of Duty game every year. Valve take the time to develop story whilst building the successor to one of the most accredited engines of all time."

valve,27dklx,speckz,12,Thu Jun 5 12:27:24 2014 UTC,"It's a shame that this needs to be said, in reality. When you invest -which is what Early Access actually is, an investment - you do so without the guarantee of a finished product.   Early Access is no different than Kickstarter, except development has already began, and the product you invested in may change drastically before release, making it a completely different product than the one you invested in, or fail to complete at all.  I am happy to see Valve breaking the silence though, as maybe this is a slight admission that they can't have a freely self curating store. It's destroying their service."
valve,27dklx,MDKAOD,2,Thu Jun 5 13:01:01 2014 UTC,"Don't think it's an admission of self curation not working, but rather, to protect themselves from people asking for refunds and subsequently placing the blame on Valve when potentially denied.  Not sure what exactly the refund policy is with Steam Early Access, it's a bit of a grey area I assume because AAA games that have pre-order demo / beta access you can usually still get a refund on before release date, but Steam Early Access is technically full access to the current state of the product and not a demo.  I know they had that situation recently with ""Earth: Year 2066"", I imagine it set a precedent that people can now ask for refunds on any Steam Early Access game and logically expect one because the game isn't ""finished"", and Valve just want to say that isn't the case by issuing this warning.  I know I've bought one or two Early Access games that had some cool marketing images and videos, but the game didn't fully deliver and the development fizzled out or feature creep occurred. They only cost me like $5 each so wasn't a big loss as I had some fun, but I'm sure other people are buying into more expensive Early Access games and feeling gypped.  tl;dr Valve saying all sales are final for Steam Early Access."
valve,27dklx,SparkyMcSparks_,1 point,Thu Jun 5 20:38:33 2014 UTC,"It shouldn't be a risky investment when it's on a game delivery system known for selling games because it is not Kickstarter nor is it meant to be.

valve,278do1,atomic1fire,1 point,Mon Jun 9 20:03:44 2014 UTC,"It was more of a joke comment on ""They shouldn't sell a remake""  Movies do that all the time, the first movie becomes so old that the only way they can really make money on it is either remaster it or use more popular actors and a new director with a vaguely similar plot. See godzilla, the a-team, etc.  Half life source was basically old half life + some new physics.  I figure Black Mesa would be a really good contender for a next gen release if they can really use the source engine at it's best. It feels much more like half life 2 in form and the first few levels aren't necessarily made boring, for instance the microwave and toilet paper things were funny and I'm pretty sure they're not in the first half life."

valve,26vh0l,bwisey,1 point,Fri May 30 13:48:43 2014 UTC,"I don't think he really thought this through. No one person needs to play every single indie game (nor could they). As long as SOMEONE plays it, they can recommend it to others, some of whom will play it.    Maybe this is where the gaming media takes responsibility. Instead of going straight to the outlet, the audience can get recommendations from the critics whose opinions have generally been proved to gel with theirs. That would be me, hopefully, if you're reading this. I believe Gabe Newell once stated in an interview that he felt the future of Steam may lie in 'curated stores', wherein a media outlet or critic puts together a little page with links to all the games they actually want you to play, and take an itty bitty cut from the sales. Sort of like how fashion boutiques work. The audience uses their favorite shop owner as a filter for the specks of gold in the bewildering ocean of new releases.   You think? Wait... you mean that game reviewers need to PLAY GAMES AND REVIEW THEM? What a novel idea. Does he think these games wouldn't exist without Steam?    I dunno. There's something to be said for TV channels, and a scheduled stream of content over which the audience has little control. There's a lot of piffle you won't have any interest in, but every now and again you'll be exposed to something you wouldn't have thought to look for, and be converted. But I think, crucially, you watch television comfortable in the knowledge that every program has had to jump through hoops like you wouldn't believe to get onto the schedule, and therefore you can be certain that the creators are taking things seriously.    Curation isn't a feature of TV, it's a bug. It exists because there are only a certain number of channels available.    Maybe that's all Steam Greenlight needs: a few more hoops. Like you can only apply if you write a 23-stanza poem on why your game deserves to be played. Or perhaps just jam a corkscrew through the back of your hand.   Getting people to play your game is the hoop!"

valve,26o9l8,noAtlas,4,Wed May 28 09:47:20 2014 UTC,That's honestly kinda how I read that. Half life 3 is coming along nicely but they had been play testing with keyboard/mouse all along. Now they have been using the controller and want to tweak the game some to get the features of the controller some traction and make it a compelling buy.
valve,26o9l8,jagid,0,Wed May 28 14:18:51 2014 UTC,"I doubt that. More like, they were going to release it with HL3 as a launch title, but HL3 isn't all the way there yet more generally."

There's a whole bunch of new technology coming to the PC space in the next 12 months, and hopefully the extra time will give Valve a chance to get their shit in order.  I'm sick of getting disconnected from Steam at least once a day.  Releasing in 2015 will still be a dickpunch to the new consoles."

I only ask because I'm on the verge of building my own gaming PC, but was holding out on details of the Steam Machines to see if they were a better buy. Now that they've been delayed, I'm even more tempted to just buy the PC parts now (since I'm not very patient). But if there's something you know of that's 'coming to the PC space' that might cause me to hold off for that, I'd be interested."

valve,26o9l8,nawoanor,1 point,Wed May 28 22:58:41 2014 UTC,"True, but Nvidia's new GPUs look to be quite a big leap ahead of their previous generation both in performance and power efficiency.  Intel's CPUs on a new process node are coming before the end of the year.  USB 3.1 will be a very good feature to have going forward.  DDR4 may not have any performance implications for gamers but I don't know the person I'm replying to is strictly a gamer.  GDDR6 (based on DDR4) should be arriving in the near future and it's expected to be twice as fast as GDDR5, which will have large performance implications for future GPUs.  PCI-E v4 won't offer any performance improvements in the immediate future but might be good to have for the sake of futureproofing."
valve,26o9l8,JeanneDOrc,2,Thu May 29 21:39:07 2014 UTC,"If they keep waiting for performance improvements they will literally never release a product.

The panel being used in Oculus Rift is 1440p, right at the very limit of what current HDMI/DP specifications allow. HDMI 2.0 and DP 1.3 will bump up the maximum resolution and framerate significantly.  All of the above are scheduled within the next 12 months.  So like I said, this is actually a really good time for Steam Machines to be delayed.  If the technologies above can be part of the first generation, they'll go from just being superior to consoles to outclassing them in every possible way."

valve,258pyq,conorf1807,1 point,Sun May 11 12:21:21 2014 UTC,"Because Valve has an almost impeccable history when it comes to leaks (if you disclose hacking). The likelihood that they would let something like this slip through the radar once, and then the likelihood that they would leave this on show all this time is extremely unlikely."
valve,258pyq,conorf1807,2,Mon May 12 05:33:32 2014 UTC,"honestly, I doubt this are actual ""leaks"". I personally think this is all controlled to keep hype up.  Remember those pictures of a changelog that were taken by someone from a tour? Yeah I'm sure Valve didn't bother cleaning up and missed something that obvious. Whoever took the photo could clearly see it otherwise why take the  photo?  But that's my tinfoil"
valve,258pyq,piratecopy,2,Mon May 12 07:16:48 2014 UTC,"I'd say that the spectacular cliffhanger at the end of ep2, the fav that Valve are releasing Source 2 and wouldn't do so without any games planned, and the fact that Half Life is one of the most anticipated game series of all time mean there is no need for it to be hyped up at all. It's all one positive continuous internet meme, which fuels the hype with no input from valve, essential having the opposite effect of what normally happens, and the hype increasing the longer the community goes without information. At this point, Valve probably realises most people understand that they aren't going to let real concrete facts and evidence slip that easily, and so they let hoaxes be, to stir the hive of already angry bees, just to see what becomes of it."

The facial animations and eye movements/contact, the physics, it was so mind blowing at the time.. Nothing else even came close, and it was such a sudden and huge leap forward. At least IMO, hard to remember exactly.  I really hope Valve eventually manages to bring about Half Life 3.. It probably wont be as huge as HL2 was for it's time, but with good made-for-VR support, it could be close, and certainly a killer app for VR. :D  After playing HL2 in VR, as much as I have already (several times through), for a game that old, it's shocking how much it almost feels like it was MADE to be a good game in VR."

valve,24ny5l,chingow,13,Sun May 4 02:02:45 2014 UTC,"Gabe Newell answered this question when he did an AMA a little while back.   He didn't say ""no"", but he said that the instability of bitcoin's price was an issue.   Unfortunately, an AMA mod then deleted the question about bitcoin that Gabe had just answered (yes, I'm really not joking, a mod actually removed a question that their AMA guest had already answered)  That's sad, because it really disrupted the conversation, and may have meant that Gabe never saw the answers to his questions about bitcoin. The solution to the volatility issue is simple, as you said: they just need to use a payment processor, like Coinbase or Bitpay, that converts Bitcoin into dollars immediately, so price volatility has no effect on Valve. Fees are still 75% cheaper than Credit Card or Paypal, and they get no chargeback fraud with bitcoin,. Chargeback and Payment fraud is actually a major, major hassle for Valve which is costing them a fortune in support.  He also had a concern about the impact of introducing another currency such as bitcoin, on the game economy. That's harder to answer, because nobody can know what would happen until they try it. IMHO, bitcoin sales would be such a small percentage of Steam's total that it would probably have no impact.  /r/AMA did eventually undelete the question, but it wasn't until long after Gabe had left  edit: Valve's former economist, Yanis Varoufakis, says bitcoin is a beautiful and impressive technology with many uses, but he also believes it would be disastrous to replace a whole national economy with bitcoin. I expect that view has an influence on the second issue that Gabe raised. Varoufakis is no longer a Valve staff member, though."

valve,24ny5l,NeoKabuto,3,Sun May 4 03:29:46 2014 UTC,"I totally agree.  I thought saying that after i had posted.  Youre right it would take a little money to implement it.  Not much though.  The CEO of overstock just did an AMA, i wish i had asked him that one question.  How much did it cost to implement it for your website."
valve,24ny5l,p-o-t-a-t-o,4,Sun May 4 04:02:46 2014 UTC,"They would have to pay some cost to implement the infrastructure to accept Bitcoin.   This is a common misconception. Most companies that accept bitcoin payments don't actually accept bitcoin. They allow people to pay in bitcoin, but a payment processor immediately exchanges those bitcoins for dollars and gives dollars to the company.   I think Overstock.com keeps only about 10% of each bitcoin payment it receives, for example, the other 90% is converted to dollars by their payment processor.  Many other companies, such as Reddit, convert 100% to dollars. It tends to be only the smaller companies that keep bitcoins, because they can be more flexible.   especially if they can't get major publishers to go along with it.   Again, this is not an issue, because Valve would be receiving dollars, not bitcoins, so the publishers would never see any bitcoins.  .  For Valve Bitcoin is really just another payment method, from which they receive dollars, it isn't really anything complicated or new. They put another button on the payment page, and the payment processor handles it. If they want to start using it internally, instead of converting it to dollars immediately, then that is a much more complicated issue.  It is a serious question whether Valve should even accept such a marginal payment method as bitcoin, because there are going to be some costs to implement it and support it, though they'll be very low. Some companies simply accept bitcoin because it gets them a little free publicity and a few new customers, and costs them very little to set up and support."
valve,24ny5l,NeoKabuto,-1,Sun May 4 04:16:41 2014 UTC,"This is a common misconception.    Valve pays its employees, therefore adding Bitcoin to Steam is not free. The misconception seems to be on your end, since you actually seem to agree with me on this. I'm not talking about transaction costs (credit cards have more costs, arguably), but that there's a guaranteed cost to implement, test and maintain it.   the publishers would never see any bitcoins   Publishers will likely not be happy with that either. Bitcoins don't translate into dollars well enough to have a direct replacement, especially given how publishers already demand regional prices (with no actual regard to exchange rates). And that's assuming publishers don't take the price fluctuations as Valve taking money that should ""rightfully"" be theirs."

I could see indie devs loving it, but the big players likely don't see it as a good thing.   It seems clear from the rest of your comment that you're assuming Valve would be handling bitcoin internally. So I answered you in that context. Publishers don't get to dictate to Valve what payment method Valve can accept. That would be like Samsung telling Overstock.com that they can't sell their phones. They don't care, they just want to receive hard currency. For a long time, major publishers have been perfectly happy with HumbleBundle.com accepting Bitcoin, for example.  There's no doubt that if Valve did accept Bitcoin directly, then they would have very significant implementation costs and many other potential issues. That's why they're really unlikely to do it. If they accept dollars through a bitcoin payment processor, by basically adding an additional option on the payment page and writing some support docs and legal documents, then the costs of implementation are going to be so tiny (i.e. thousands of dollars) that they're insignificant for a company of Valve's size. Look at other companies that accept bitcoin to see what I mean - if they're already accepting a few payment processors, like Paypal, then adding more is trivial.   Bitcoins don't translate into dollars well enough to have a direct replacement   I don't understand. The payment processor handles this, Valve doesn't. Valve posts a price in dollars or euros, and they receive dollars or euros."

The risk is of it not paying off, especially if they can't get major publishers to go along with it.    The risk of not paying off isn't a serious issue for a company of Valve's size, because the cost is so small compared to their business scale.   especially if they can't get major publishers to go along with it.    If a major publisher has an incredibly strong dislike of bitcoin, then it's easy for Valve to not display that payment method for that particular publisher. But Publishers generally don't get to decide how their sales partners receive payments. They really do not care. Look at humblebundle.com for example. Or look at the fact that every major electronics manufacturer in the world is already happily accepting payments from companies that are selling their stuff for bitcoin. As long as they get their money, they don't care.   I could see indie devs loving it, but the big players likely don't see it as a good thing.   This kind of comment is why I assume you still don't understand how this would work. You seem to be expecting Valve to start sending bitcoins to devs and publishers. That isn't likely to happen anytime soon. Because you're mistakenly expecting this, or implying it, you're seriously overestimating the cost and difficulty.  It doesn't matter if indie devs 'love' bitcoin or not. In fact, if they love bitcoin, they're going to be disappointed, because Valve won't give them any bitcoins. Nothing would change for them. They would not get paid in bitcoin. They wouldn't have to think about bitcoin. They'd just keep getting exactly the same payments as before, in dollars or whatever.  edit:    And that's assuming publishers don't take the price fluctuations as Valve taking money that should ""rightfully"" be theirs.   Again, this sort of comment makes me think that you really don't understand how bitcoin payment processors work. Valve and their publishers would not be affected by price fluctuations. If Valve ask for US$20 for a game, and someone pays for that game with Bitcoins, then Valve immediately gets US$20. Doesn't matter if the bitcoin price is going up, down, sideways, or whatever."
valve,24ny5l,NeoKabuto,1 point,Sun May 4 06:09:08 2014 UTC,"But you agree that there is some non-zero risk involved, due to there being a non-zero cost required to add, test, and maintain it. That's the only point that actually matters, and all three of us (you, me, and OP) seem to agree on it. We weren't talking about if it actually would stop Valve, just if it exists at all.  All you needed to do to prove publishers don't care is bringing up the Humble Bundle. I'll admit that it was speculation."
valve,24ny5l,amunak,1 point,Sun May 4 17:23:02 2014 UTC,"If a major publisher has an incredibly strong dislike of bitcoin, then it's easy for Valve to not display that payment method for that particular publisher. But Publishers generally don't get to decide how their sales partners receive payments.   IANAL, but I think they are legally obliged not to dictate that."
valve,24ny5l,amunak,1 point,Sun May 4 10:06:56 2014 UTC,"there's a guaranteed cost to implement, test and maintain it.   As is price for implementing and maintaining stuff like PaySafeCard, MoneyBookers, WebMoney or PayPal. And they implemented that at some point. Judging from how many paymet options they have it is not that costly. And it would likely gain them some publicity and people may want to try it just out of interest, generating them revenue. I don't think it could possibly be unfavourable.   Bitcoins don't translate into dollars well enough to have a direct replacement, especially given how publishers already demand regional prices   They can easily set price in bitcoins on-the-fly from their dollar price according to the transfer rate. I wouldn't be surprised if exchanges accounted for this and allowed you to set price in dollars which they then just convert to bitcoin themselves."

valve,22rd2e,Jabrono,5,Fri Apr 11 07:37:04 2014 UTC,"Well, seeing as Valve's VR lead, Michael Abrash, left Valve for Oculus...  No, I don't think Valve has any more plans besides supporting Oculus."
valve,22rd2e,Slukaj,2,Fri Apr 11 18:07:49 2014 UTC,"I've heard that, and that sucks for Valve, but I don't think it means they're going to support anything made by Facebook.

valve,22rd2e,Jabrono,1 point,Sat Apr 12 06:56:22 2014 UTC,"Facebook and valve aren't in the same market as of yet. You can't predict what facebook's business practices in the tech market will be like. There's a chance facebook wants to move into hardware, and they're starting out by releasing a product that hasn't been done (properly) before, so there's minimum competition. Also, occulus is just being funded by facebook. They work independently."

valve,228ydn,jetpig,1 point,Thu May 1 16:33:39 2014 UTC,"The main issue with spending time to develop it for games is that you don't know whether the end user is going to use headphones or speakers and where those speakers are going to be placed. For example, most people using a Steam Machine in their living room would be using a stereo or surround setup. Binaural sound only works if you know they're going to use headphones, as far as I know. So, yes it has a future in VR, but the gimmick isn't currently worth the time for non-VR games."
valve,228ydn,thealphamike,5,Sat Apr 5 15:16:55 2014 UTC,"There's no reason that it couldn't be turned off, and stereo and surround setups are already built in. For more competitive games, like CS:GO, sound cues are an enormous part of the game, and anyone serious is using a decent set of headphones already. And who cares about Steam machines? They're console gamer bait (a good thing) and consoles have crap for audio design already. Like COD which removed footsteps because it would give and advantage to people who used headphones.  Including Binaural sound as an option in, say, Source 2, along with modern graphics capability and keeping the responsiveness and performance of the Source engine would make it an amazing engine for competitive games."
valve,228ydn,gu3st12,1 point,Sat Apr 5 18:29:11 2014 UTC,"Well, all source games do make the distinction between ""Headphones"" and ""2/5/7 Speakers""."
valve,228ydn,hanging_moon,1 point,Sun Apr 6 03:23:09 2014 UTC,"You are correct. The binaural effect only works with headphones. Binaural recording is when you make a stereo recording with 2 microphones placed at ear level of the 'listener'. Often dummy heads are used to place the mics accurately. Because a binaural recording captures sounds at the 'correct' angles from a person's ears, this sort of tricks your brain when you hear it played back on headphones and allows you to, for lack of a better way of putting it, construct a 3D sound space in your mind. It's very cool."

valve,21idkw,scriptmonkey420,3,Thu Mar 27 20:09:47 2014 UTC,"well, it seems to sort of respawn you close-by when you die, but where it chooses those respawn points seems to be sort of arbitrary and not always consistent, and the health and armor you get when respawning seems to be at the same levels as they were when the game arbitrarily chose that particular location.  So there was a certain point where the game kept respawning me in the canals where you need to avoid the rockets being down shot at you by that armored vehicle up on a bridge, and it kept respawning me just before that point but with ~40 health and no armor, so I couldn't even dodge the rocket without taking some kind of damage that would keep killing me over and over again.  also, the vehicles became incredibly twitchy and difficult to control.  in the scenes where you need good control of your hoverboat to ride over a fallen pipe or something, it was extremely frustrating."

Now it may be too late, since they already lost their VR guy, Abrash, to Oculus, and there's no doubt in my mind Facebook will launch a ""VR gaming platform"" alongside the CV1 next year, because:  1 they're big enough to do that  2 they want the revenue share  They will become full blown competitors to Valve, and Valve's future is now more in danger than ever, even compared to the issues they have with Windows 8, because VR gaming is the future, but now Valve will play a much smaller role in it, unless they hire a top notch team to work on its own VR headset soon, and also lock Oculus out of their games, or Oculus will profit from Steam as long as they can, and then just dump them for Facebook's platform."
valve,21m6mh,Nenyael,3,Fri Mar 28 19:25:48 2014 UTC,"VR is not the future of games. It's merely an element of some future games. Good games are the future of games, for as long as people seek out good games to play.  EA is a major rival to Valve, as not only do they also develop games, but they have a competing digital distribution platform (such systems actually were a the future of games) with Origin. EA games weren't locked out of Steam by Valve; there's a bunch of EA titles available for sale through Steam. EA is the one that withholds potential Steam launches for major titles in order to push their inferior (though reasonably common) digital platform. Valve survives this just fine.  It's not like 100% of video games in development right now were being designed to run exclusively for Oculus Rift, and nothing else. It was a very small minority of hyper-focused titles. A much larger number had Rift support, which just means that you could play them with an Oculus Rift and they'd be visually optimized to work with the system (though the level of proficiency with which support was added varies, see Eve Online).  The worst thing for gamers that Facebook could do is require a partnership or license fee from developers seeking Rift support. This would also be the worst thing that Facebook could do to themselves, because the large majority of Rift-enabled titles are from very small studios that aren't going to want to share revenue for a coolish gimmick that only a small percent of their playerbase will ever use.  Seriously, don't worry about the future of video games, they'll be just fine. Worry more about the future of the Facebook Rift, since that is the thing most likely to fail right now in the games industry, due to bandwagoning, reactonary fanbase outrage, and the fact that the kind of gamers that Rift was perfect for are the same kind of gamers that belittle and vilify the kind of games that Facebook is known for.  ...But, if Valve did want to keep working on their VR system, I'd be totally cool with that."
valve,21evjf,jspenguin,7,Wed Mar 26 13:43:59 2014 UTC,"Has it been announced that Oculus' API will be switching to a closed source model?  Because if it's still going to be open source, this is a lot of kneejerking."
valve,21evjf,Slukaj,8,Wed Mar 26 15:22:50 2014 UTC,"It's not that that the Oculus SDK will ever be closed, it's that it will only ever support Oculus. Without a common API, every game dev will have to support every individual device's SDK, forcing them to choose between purchasing multiple dev kits or losing customers that chose a different device.  If the game devs support a common API, then there is no need for them to try to guess which device will ""win"". How many games do you know of that only work with NVIDIA, and completely fail to run on AMD?  The PC games market abhors ""exclusives"". PC gamers prefer choice, and a common API makes that possible.  Even if Oculus didn't sell out, supporting a common API makes a lot of sense."
valve,21evjf,Slukaj,4,Wed Mar 26 15:43:42 2014 UTC,"In the wake of yesterday's announcement   It's not that that the Oculus SDK will ever be closed, it's that it will only ever support Oculus.    Then what does yesterdays announcement have to do with this? That would have been a problem regardless of who owned Oculus. I don't think this has anything to do with a lack of a common API, I think it has more to do with companies wanting to avoid Facebook.  Also: Valve releasing their own API will not make any difference if Oculus' API remains open source.   If the Oculus API remains open source, people are more than capable of just forking the code, stripping away the Facebook elements, and using it as is.  If you believe this is a problem because of software-to-hardware implementation issues, a Valve API won't change anything, either.   The PC games market abhors ""exclusives"".   Yet here we are with most games requiring DirectX. And Steam. And Origin. And UPlay."
valve,21evjf,Slukaj,3,Wed Mar 26 15:49:27 2014 UTC,"Also: Valve releasing their own API will not make any difference if Oculus' API remains open source.    The Oculus SDK is not open source: ""You can only distribute or re-distribute LibOVR in whole, not in part."" You can't strip out anything added by Oculus or Facebook. Also, anything you add to it becomes the property of Oculus, and therefore Facebook. That being said, I really don't think Facebook will try to integrate ads and facebook connections within libOVR itself.   Yet here we are with most games requiring DirectX. And Steam. And Origin. And UPlay.   Those are all software platforms, and all essentially free for the end-user, with the exception that DirectX, Origin, and UPlay all require Windows.   Edit: clarification"
valve,21evjf,rawros,1 point,Wed Mar 26 16:11:39 2014 UTC,"Ok, then the argument should have never been about Facebook. You're right, I agree, it would be nice to get an open-source API released by SOMEONE.   But the whole faux outrage over Facebook has gotten pretty annoying. Sorry if I came across as blaming you for that."
valve,21evjf,FreakingScience,1 point,Wed Mar 26 16:24:29 2014 UTC,Then what does yesterdays announcement have to do with this?    This:   some developers who previously supported Oculus are choosing to drop VR support completely   Notch said he's dropping VR support on Minecraft because he doesn't like Facebook. I don't know about other devs.
valve,21evjf,timewarp,0,Wed Mar 26 16:49:44 2014 UTC,"Rookie dev here; we dropped consideration for VR support a few days before the Facebook announcement. We thought we might look back into it later, but since we're exclusively developing for PC, that meant we had pretty much only one option: Rift. VR is now completely off the table.  We knew that Valve was dabbling in VR, but it seemed to us like they were more interested in it from a purely R&D perspective, and had passed the torch to Oculus since it wasn't ever going to be Valve's main focus.  At that time, we'd decided that one way or the other, we'd look into VR again if Valve actually did consider releasing hardware for it. Now that this news has broken, that's the only scenario where we're likely to reconsider VR support. A major industry player like Valve setting some kind of standard API for VR would be an attractive concept, but overall, VR is still just a gimmick (albeit a powerful and very cool one).  Even if the Rift hardware is the best in the business, we won't develop specifically for it with any sort of proprietary API because the majority of the team finds Facebook to be an untrustworthy corporation, and letting them into our game to measure and sell every aspect of our players is not something we're willing to deal with."

Either way though, the way Facebook makes the most money off of Oculus is to make its products a success which it won't do by merely using it as a VR Facebook and ads headset.   ""There are no statutes that put the shareholder at the top of the corporate priority list. In most states, corporations can be formed for any lawful purpose. Cornell University law professor Lynn Stout has been looking for years for a corporate charter that even mentions maximizing profits or share price. She hasn’t found one.  Nor does the law require, as many believe, that executives and directors owe a special fiduciary duty to shareholders. The fiduciary duty, in fact, is owed simply to the corporation, which is owned by no one, just as you and I are owned by no one — we are all “persons” in the eyes of the law. Shareholders, however, have a contractual claim to the “residual value” of the corporation once all its other obligations have been satisfied — and even then directors are given wide latitude to make whatever use of that residual value they choose, as long they’re not stealing it for themselves.""  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/09/09/how-the-cult-of-shareholder-value-wrecked-american-business/?wprss=rss_ezra-klein&clsrd=&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter"

Given that Valve is currently porting Portal to Nvidia Shield (ARM + Android) it's a safe bet they probably want Android compatibility in Source 2 as well.  I'm saying this based on Valve's past behavior; when starting work on a new platform, they usually start by porting one of their old games.  If they're already supporting PC, Mac, and Linux, supporting PS4 and Xbone isn't a big leap.  Same basic architecture after all."

valve,20v1uv,iwasazombie,7,Thu Mar 20 00:43:58 2014 UTC,"Words from Gabe Newell ""Get really good at what you do.""   It would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with Valve employees and what their skills are and what defines them.  Here is a Youtube channel of a Valve employee, he is incredibly intelligent and very scientifically minded. As you can see, he isn't merely a game developer, but a highly motivated person who is always doing something in order to better himself and teach others.   Check him out!  I've always wanted to work for Valve myself, but I'm only a level designer and Valve has always outpaced my ability to improve. I for a long time imagined making something great enough for Valve to notice, but I've come to realize that is not a proper form of motivation. I've just been map making in my free time, always trying to improve, and who knows maybe one day I'll apply to Valve and get some intern position or something, enabling me to get even better.   One last point of interest, Valve is one of the most profitable companies in the world per employee. It would be a good idea for you to become capable of generating your own revenue using Valve's workshop for either Dota2, TF2, or CSGO. Make something people want to buy, it is probably one of the best ways to convince Valve you can provide value to the company.   I'm working on 2 maps for CSGO, both with the intention of being competitive and getting into the next Operation map pack release. If I was ever able to accomplish this, I would then likely apply to Valve as a level designer / environment artist and try to get an intern position.   If you really want to work for Valve, team up with somebody else who shares a similar goal. It is incredibly difficult to find people in this world to team up with and to actually complete something, it is also incredibly hard to be adequately productive when working alone.

What they really want is employees who can create a finished product (be it 3D models, or movies, or video game levels, or even full games). From there, there's an additional layer of consideration as to whether you create things that are interesting enough, or of a high-even quality, but you still need the product. (If you have a high-quality unfinished project, you've just demonstrated that you can't finish a high-quality project.)  The idea is that they want their employees to all be motivated and able to work well independently (what do you do if you want to make levels, but can't make models? Make levels using models you can acquire!""), and therefore exceptionally well together.  For you personally, don't worry as much about lack of game design. That's not all they do. I wouldn't worry about buzzwords or making things in their engine, either. They're probably more likely to see a cool video set in one of their universes that's going around virally, but if you're formally applying, they'll likely look at your portfolio anyway. I would say to update your portfolio. Make it a solid and impressive, and a sufficient indication of your talents and abilities. Think about what you can do for Valve. Why do they need to hire you? What can you contribute to their enterprise? Their products? Their content? But also remember that Valve is comprised of individual people. You need to give them reason to want to work with you, which means demonstrating that you are creative, intelligent, and productive. All of that on top of simply showing that you are capable of producing interesting, high-quality work."

valve,20v1uv,NatsuTheFaol,1 point,Wed Apr 2 01:25:54 2014 UTC,"A far simpler summation probably could have been: Play offensive, not defensive. Instead of NOT giving them reasons to reject you, give them TO want to hire you.  It's generally good advice for most companies, but for Valve it's especially important. They don't need to hire people. They're not limited by budgets, but they're also not in dire need of new hires. They're also not in some constant ""grow by X percent each year"" situation, looking to add to their workforce 'just because' like many large tech companies. They can afford to be choosy. They can afford to be picky as all hell."

Half Life 3 is also coming, but it'll take a while. I'd say late 2015 - early 2016  Team Fortress 3 will definetly be released. I just don't know when.   Portal 3 MIGHT come out. It'll probably feature another character, Chell's storyline is already wrapped.  Dota 3 will come out, but it'll take a looooong time."

In the infinite limbo between 2 and 3."
valve,200ma7,dudeface-,2,Mon Mar 10 22:56:23 2014 UTC,I would imagine they designed source2 to just replace / extend modules currently in games so Dota2 / TF2 and CS:GO can be incrementaly updated regarding different sections.  It's not like TF2 and Dota2 don't already look great.

I mostly want to fight mantis men and get a crisp 60 bucks.  I just recently bought the earlier half life games, so while I'm waiting for half life three I just discovered how hilarious the tutorial to half life opposing force is, and part of that is the reason I lost that tutorial 3 times.   Spoilers: In HF-OP, most valve players will probably know this but I started playing with half life 2 so I never really touched the earlier games until now. You can shoot the drill instructors, and I shot the sniper instructor three times after realizing this, but I guess they planned on people shooting the instructor because there's a checkpoint, after realizing I could do it the first time"
valve,200ma7,mossman555,22,Thu Mar 20 10:22:17 2014 UTC,"As said, Portal 3 wont happen, and I don't hold it against them. The story ended well, and doesn't really need a continuation, considering that it was already announced that Chell will make an appearance alongside Gordon in hl3 a while back.  Valve previously announced that they were done with episodic content, so Half Life 3 is the other biggun. Right now, its got the duke nukem syndrome. Hype overwhelmed the community, and it cannot possibly live up to the expectations of the fans. I know that Duke Nukem Forever was passed through different companies and later finished in a years worth of work, but people are expecting alot of HL3. The leap from HL1 - HL2 was huge. The lifelike physics, faces and lighting was a huge shock, and its really hard to do something like that nowadays that would really surprise today's audience. I'm guessing they are betting everything on source 2.  Team Fortress 3 wont happen either. Its too much off a cash cow right now, and the community wont just jump ship after they have spent so much money on the servers/items alone, and just saying ""For all these items, we will port them into the other game"" would be far too silly.  That will take alot of time from the programmers that has little to no profit or benefit.  Day of Defeat was never a big franchise, maybe valve could reignite it with a source 2 modification? I think that nobody would really be ready for it though, after being conditioned to shooters requiring your general cod bullshit (Kill streaks, Incredibly tiny maps, Iron sights out the ass). It just wouldn't sell well unless they do some miraculous with it.  Left 4 Dead 3, I can see happening and happening soon. It could be a launch title with Source 2, but as someone also pointed out, mods have done alot for the game so far. As long as it has a large amount of content, im sure that it could reel old fans in."

valve,200ma7,TheBallPeenHammerer,1 point,Mon Mar 10 15:10:54 2014 UTC,"Basically, Half Life 3 confirmed. It's gonna exist.   L4D3 would be awesome, but the modding community is spurting out tons of quality content for L4D2, and Left 4 Dead has no real ongoing storyline.   Team Fortress 2 is being expanded upon constantly by Valve, and since it's free to play, making Team Fortress 3 would be pointless, where they could just remake TF2 in Source 2 (or maybe this would be TF3, you never know.)   Portal 2 ended perfectly, trying to squeeze in another portal game would just be a money-grab, since Portal 2 was both a sequel and a prequel.   Dota 3? I don't think so. Ricochet 3? Ricochet 2 comes first. CS:GO just came out, and has no storyline (plus it's like CS4)  Episode 2 ended with cliffhangers and open questions, so we need a Half Life 3. But other than that, I think there's no need to count to 3."
valve,200ma7,DillonMabry,1 point,Mon Mar 10 15:20:16 2014 UTC,"Ah okay that makes a lot more sense. Before it seemed like you were saying L4D3 wasn't needed because you could just mod L4D2 endlessly, which would've been a dumb thing to say."
valve,200ma7,TheBallPeenHammerer,7,Mon Mar 10 15:33:49 2014 UTC,"With that logic I don't see why we ever need sequels.  I'll give you an obvious example: the jump from L4D1 to 2.  Now wait, you say, there was a lot of outrage over that.  People thought it was much too soon.  I would argue that this is true, however the quality between a valve release and another valve sequel is far and beyond anything I've seen in terms of mods.  New enemies, characters, etc. would be great.  And no, I don't want to see Anime character reskins and use that as a reason for no more sequels.  I want professional character design, map design, weapons, etc.  I didn't say we need it now, I'm just saying to say we never need another Portal or L4D or Team Fortress is silly."
valve,200ma7,DillonMabry,2,Mon Mar 10 15:35:34 2014 UTC,"Well, a mod can't make a console version..."
valve,200ma7,spandario,0,Mon Mar 10 05:34:21 2014 UTC,"Valve's main platform is PC, though. Hell, they practically monopolize huge gaming on the PC with Steam. A console version of the 3 games could actually never come into existence, considering Gabe's public opinion on them as well as the new Steamboxes. I do hate to be blunt, but if console players want content, they should make the switch."
valve,200ma7,NeoKabuto,2,Mon Mar 10 08:26:56 2014 UTC,"The console market is a sizable market, and Valve will continue to produce games for that market as long as it's profitable. Which it will be for quite some time. Console gamers aren't just going to migrate to PC overnight for ______ 3, even if it's a fantastic game. I'm sure Valve understands that, and as such, they'll continue making games for consoles.  Although I agree with your stance that the PC is the superior platform, and gaming would be all the better for it to be the platform, I think your Master-Race-Circlejerk mentality is getting in the way of understanding how a business works."
valve,200ma7,iniccuZ,1 point,Mon Mar 10 15:18:12 2014 UTC,"Though you have to consider that console sales are dropping rapidly, especially with this generation. Consoles may be dead very soon, plus if they aren't, Steambox will need to be competitive, and so will need exclusives."
valve,200ma7,ryan_the_leach,1 point,Mon Mar 10 23:34:33 2014 UTC,"A fair point, but even then, the drop in console sales isn't all that drastic. And as much as I'd like consoles to die it, it won't happen for a while.  And Valve has said they won't be making exclusives."

valve,200ma7,Grimlexx,5,Mon Mar 10 23:51:53 2014 UTC,"I do agree that Portal has no loose ends, but I still think it'd be jnteresting where Valve will take that story line. I remember reading somewhere that they wanted to integrate Chell's story with Half-Life, but I don't know how legit that is."
valve,200ma7,TheBallPeenHammerer,3,Mon Mar 10 22:43:50 2014 UTC,"Unless HL3 comes and changes things, they're probably staying separate, albeit in the same universe. Portal 2 takes place long after HL2 (and probably after everything with the Combine is resolved)."
valve,200ma7,LightSpeedIII,3,Mon Mar 10 04:06:57 2014 UTC,"The original Portal didn't have any loose ends as far as I remember, but they still made Portal 2; I could see them making a Portal 3."
valve,200ma7,atomic1fire,1 point,Mon Mar 10 04:24:59 2014 UTC,"chell was never alive and out.  In addition they updated it, added in plot elements that never existed just before portal 2 was released."
valve,200ma7,NeoKabuto,0,Mon Mar 10 05:41:25 2014 UTC,"Original Portal had the loose end of the robot dragging you back and saying ""Thank you for assuming the party submission position."" at the very end. Also there were so many questions unanswered, like who built Aperture? Why? When? How? Who is Glados? Etc. etc."
valve,200ma7,atomic1fire,5,Mon Mar 10 09:41:02 2014 UTC,"Valve updated the game to have that ending, in the original Portal release on Steam, Chell got outside the testing facility and was able to look around, it was only just before Portal 2 that Valve updated the ending to have Chell dragged back inside by robots."

valve,200ma7,martinarcand1,1 point,Mon Mar 10 16:29:40 2014 UTC,They added that in an update during the ARG for portal 2
valve,200ma7,YeahYeahSureWhatever,1 point,Mon Mar 10 16:33:23 2014 UTC,Portal 2 basically answered most if not all of those questions.
valve,200ma7,Suicidal360Flip,2,Mon Mar 10 16:29:29 2014 UTC,"making another L4D would create almost no expansion that mods haven't already done, or will do in the future.   Valve has a history of hiring mod developers and expanding on their work, so it wouldn't surprise me. I'd actually love to see official, more polished versions of a lot of the community made gamemodes (like the ""Let's Build a"" maps)."
valve,200ma7,mb86,1 point,Thu Mar 20 10:25:19 2014 UTC,Jaykin bacon episode 4 announced by valve.  /s
valve,200ma7,mb86,1 point,Mon Mar 10 04:27:11 2014 UTC,"I think you underestimate the possibilities of L4D3. There's always room for more types of Special Infected, new weapons, new mechanics. Look at what Turtle Rock (the original L4D guys) are doing now with Evolve, for example. And just because you could do some of that with mods doesn't mean Valve will.  Not to mention that what you're really overlooking is that Left4Dead has a story as well. L4D2 tangibly expanded the world not only by changing locations but by revealing some things about the government response to the outbreaks. And that's on top of the revelation that the PCs are all ""carriers"" of the infection.  There's no reason they can't revisit the L4D world just to continue the story, even if they don't have any new mechanical ideas (which they almost certainly do)."

valve,1zwy13,lasthour1,3,Sat Mar 8 21:37:29 2014 UTC,They have 3D models you could have put into the picture. No need to be a dick.
valve,1zwy13,hanssone,0,Sat Mar 8 22:13:42 2014 UTC,"Truth is truth, there are 3D models. But Alien Swarm is not really the best Valve game of all time. And in my personal opinion, I thought it wasn't worth it to include that game too."
