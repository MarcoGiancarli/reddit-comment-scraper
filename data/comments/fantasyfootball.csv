fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,foulmouthfb,9,Tue Jul 21 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"The good thing is Forsett and Miller are both being drafted as RB2's, so the potential risk already factors into the price tag.  Demarco's concerns (workload, injury) are well noted, and he falls to the second round a lot as a result, but don't fall victim to metrics like that. Last year was when Marshawn was supposed to fall off the cliff and look what he did..  I agree Forte may be slightly overdrafted in the mid first, but the reason he did so well last year is because the coaching staff utilized him so much in the passing game. He won't catch 100 balls again, but the coaching staff knows what they have in him and will put him to work in some way.  I completely disagree with the analysis on JC. He's the unquestioned centerpiece of that offense, and still finished as RB7 (I think) battling injury for the first month.  As for who's gonna take their spot in the top 10? Mark Ingram and Alfred Morris are both primed for solid years, but the upside is capped since they won't likely be utilized in the passing game that much. Lesean McCoy will be the beneficiary of a heavy workload, but keep in mind he still failed to finish top 10 last year with 312 attempts, with a much better O-Line There's a number of rookies in line for solid work, but there's a reason to be skeptical of all of them, at least in redraft (I think Melvin and Gurley will be studs). Also, it seems every year there is a guy like Zac Stacy who comes out of nowhere and puts up top 10 numbers.  There is this guy named Adrian Peterson, though, something tells me he'd be top 10.  TLDR: Hard to predict who willl fall, and who will climb the rankings."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Seductive_Santa,7,Tue Jul 21 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"Remember last year well. Was fully on the ""dont touch Lynch"" train. Interestingly, it doesn't seem like there is as much concern for him this year when there should be even more.  Miller is VERY cheap right now. Might not be a top 10 back but love getting him at that current spot"

Last year was when Marshawn was supposed to fall off the cliff and look what he did..   Murray and Lynch is an apples-to-oranges comparison. Lynch doesn't have near the injury history of Murray.  Also, counting receptions and the post season, Murray had over 450 touches last year. Lynch has never approached that.  Plus Murray will split time in that backfield.  Regression out of the top 10 isn't a crazy idea at all, I'd be more surprised if he remains in the top 10 honestly."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Seductive_Santa,0,Tue Jul 21 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that Demarco is a lot more risky than Lynch (you'd be dumb not to see that), but my point is that the narrative is the same. Everyone said Marshawn would bust based on certain metrics, and he had a great season. Now everyone is saying the same for Demarco (granted his circumstances are different). He's a tremendous runner and will get the lion's share of carries in that offense as long as he's healthy."

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Malephic,2,Tue Jul 21 18:43:00 2015 UTC,"Major Seahawk fan here. I don't like Lynch at all this year. First of all, the already bad O Line is now further depleted with the loss of Max Unger. I don't have the exact numbers on me, but I know for a fact Lynch's production dropped while Unger was out. Also, with Jimmy Graham there, in theory, Lynch should see less RZ looks. We also have a new rookie WR in Tyler Lockett, who apparently looks amazing in OTA's, and Chris Matthews (unexpected star of our last SB), is a 6'5 WR, and he will probably make the roster and be used in the RZ. Combine all that with Lynch's age, his receding interest in the game (his claims of retiring soon), and his back problems, and you have a recipe for 1st Round disaster."

He has also played in 6-7 more games over the past 2 seasons that almost anyone else we're talking about. That's another 100-150 touches that impact a body and set someone back a bit. I don't have his career numbers on hand, but I know it's usage, not age, that predicts a RB dropoff, and Lynch has been run into the ground the past few years."

Foster (Strong defense will make time of possession and running game important, injury-prone)  5.) Lynch (Oline concerns, age concerns, always proves people wrong though)  6.) Miller (Solid production last year, Tannehill has improved each year, should continue to improve, hitting prime of career)  7.) Hill (Stable offense, dependable defense, built on run-first)  8.) Murray (Fast paced offense, Sproles and Matthews threat to poach, unpredictable HC)  9.) Forsett (Good Oline, Flacco deep throw to spread out defense, good defense to encourage run game)  10.)

If he had broke an extra run for a 62-yard TD he would have passed every single metric, lol. That's how close he was on all of them. Oh, and if he was born 1 month later.  I think Forte has a good chance of slipping out of the top 10 but this article did a poor job of making that argument."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,FFMonstar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:34 2015 UTC,"Would disagree.   The metrics are well pretty well defined based on historical trends. Think of it like a (MUCH) less technical Kenpom rankings for college basketball, and how those are used to predict national champions. Arbitrarily defined based on prior years and some teams are 'on the cusp' (like Forte) but ultimately fall short of the 'required' metrics. If he had that 62-yard TD run like you said it would still put him on the lower end of all these metrics.  Of course it's hard to point to any of these backs and say without doubt they are in for a dropoff season. All of these RBs are coming off top 10 years so they all are looking really good. It's just a unique way to look at a common problem in fantasy, something to be aware of but like with any stat not fully rely on.   In over 100 individual seasons only one player has failed 2 of these metrics and still stayed in the top 10. Forte failed 5. So I disagree on it doing a poor job of making the argument. We've even had multiple readers tell us they aren't drafting Forte this year just based on the article alone.  edit: Not OP of this Reddit post but author of the article. Enjoy the feedback/criticism, /r/fantasyfootball is a really savvy bunch"
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Wikileakles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't realize this was your article.  I guess my point is mostly around the thresholds. YPC = 4.0, rushing yards = 1,100, longest run = 40 yards. It's not just a coincidence those are such nice numbers, right? You picked round numbers that happen to barely exclude Forte in every category. Those numbers are arbitrary in the sense that a 1,100 yard season is not really any better than a 1,099 yard season, and it's only ~0.375 fantasy points per week better than Forte's actual yardage. It's a scale, and presenting it in a binary pass/fail method around arbitrary ""nice round"" numbers doesn't add anything to the argument.  Making the distinction that he is on the cusp makes more sense to me, especially when your article summary used the word ""overwhelming"" to describe Forte's very slight shortcomings."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,succulentjoint,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"lol no need to apologize my man. Your points are valid.  I get what you're saying with the thresholds, especially since Forte is pretty close to reaching several of them. However, most of the thresholds are intentionally pretty wide to begin with, to capture as many players as possible and leave out those with poor achieving stats who could be 'red flags'. So I believe even if Forte was to just reach them and ""pass"" the metrics it still would be a sign of an RB to caution drafting since he would still be near the bottom on most of them compared to historical RBs  Things like 4.0+ YPC, 1,100+ rushing yards, 7+ rushing touch downs are not stats that are hard to come by for a top 10 RB. ~90% of RBs who had repeat top 10 performances going back a decade passed all of those metrics. It's been a while since I wrote this but I believe most of the top RBs from 2014 had no trouble getting well over 4 YPC, 7 TDs, etc.  I absolutely agree the binary pass/fail black/white model has its flaws but it still comes down to the same arguments if the binary model was removed  -Forte is another year older and RBs historically decline at his age  -a low YPC can be a sign of poor O-line play or player losing elusiveness  -less rushing yards means the offense doesn't focus on the run game enough  -few rushing TDs means the same as above, or the team looks elsewhere at goal line opportunities  -short 'long run length' can mean Forte is lacking the breakaway speed he used to have  Individually these can mean nothing but when they are all factored together that Forte comes in at/near the bottom when compared to his peers it is something I took notice of.  Overwhelming is a very strong term but I stand behind the logic of the article and am confident in recommending someone not use their first round pick on Matt Forte."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Wisefool157,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"Man, you guys are really hard on forsett."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Malephic,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:53 2015 UTC,Forsett was an every down back whose returning competition for offensive touches is 36 and he now has the guy who got Forte 100 catches last year coming to town. I'm in on Forsett at a late 2nd round cost every time.
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Wikileakles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to be a repeat top 10 back to contribute to a great fantasy team. Luckily for players like Forsett and especially L. Miller it looks like their ADPs are low enough where they can still be value picks.   We like Miller over Forsett in 2015 in terms of value, but both can be very serviceable RB2s"
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Wikileakles,2,Tue Jul 21 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"Very cool read. Thanks for posting.  Out of Murray, Bell, Lynch, Forte, Foster, Lacy, Charles, Forsett, Miller and Hill..

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Dr_Lollygag,2,Tue Jul 21 18:40:23 2015 UTC,"Justin Forsett and Jermy Hill are my most I don't think they will be top 10.

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,donnylong,5,Tue Jul 21 19:00:13 2015 UTC,Thats your opinion but I dont see how Charles finishes behind Foster who just cant stay healthy for 16 games and Lynch who has a depleted line.

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could easily, I repeat easily place Charles into anyone of the top 4 spots I have, I could very easily see him being the number 1 back this year. But if I had to make a bet these are the four people I feel can consistently produce throughout the season given their situations and injury proneness."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,welsman13,2,Tue Jul 21 19:11:42 2015 UTC,What's your knock with Hill? He has a tough schedule but the talent and opportunities are there.  Would say Lacy and Bell are safest bets. If Foster can stay on the field he should be able to produce a top 10 season no problem
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,rhino43grr,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:26 2015 UTC,"I still see Bernard as someone to take away many of his opportunities. I think Hill is clearly the better player but I don't like players that, baring a fumble, can be benched with not a lot of negative effects on their team in fantasy. I'm not saying Bernard is on the same level as Hill but I am saying that Bernard is going to be in there taking carries and especially receptions away from Hill. With the four guys I listed I feel like they are consistently the workhorses and don't have much competition to take touches away."

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Tomoromo9,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:11 2015 UTC,"I love that he's the only back, and not RBBC. Guy finished as the #8 back last year, and with trestman as the new OC, I can see him doubling his 44 catches from last year"
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,docollas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"Might be worth noting that the rookie Buck Allen behind him is a talented pass catching and blocking RB.

fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,jesterx7769,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"For me it's Bell (missing 4 games), Hill (will split with Gio, jones and eifert back), Miller (6 games against Pats, Bills and Jets as well as Giants, Ravens and Cowboys) and Foster (think he finally breaks down).    As for replacements, for one, Peterson. Mccoy will push for top 10. I think Melvin Gordon is a top 10 back in his rookie year. Joique Bell if he holds off Abdullah and boarding the hype train, CJ Anderson. Any runningback that plays with Peyton is going to push for a top 10 slot.    Regarding the above article I think Forsett can stay top 10. Mcgee and Taliaferro are more short yardage backs and won't play much on first and second down imo. Forsett also, for being 30, has very little tread on the tires. He's never been a full time guy anywhere else. I think Murray drops from number 1 but is still top 10. Yes Charles is with Reid but Westbrook and Mccoy were top 10 backs under Reid in several different seasons. With Marshall gone Forte will still be a big part of the offence although he's lost a step and Lynch is still the centre piece of that Shithawks offence."
fantasyfootball,3e3m8k,Spartan8585,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:58 2015 UTC,They're not going to increase Bell's suspension as the result of his appeal. He's currently set to be suspended for 3 games and fined an additional game check. After the appeal it's probably reduced to 2 games.
fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,Malephic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Injuries happen, but I also feel like Lacy might be a littler safer than some of the other top RBs because he won't be getting the same amount of touches, but can still generate a similar amount of yards."

fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,Tyrannosaurus_Dex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great post and would like to see what others say about this.  With being a previous stock holder of Lacy I would say Lacy would be the better guy to have. When he's had to deal with his concussions he's had to miss less time than the other fellas. Last year's hit that caused a concussion was pretty brutal too and out of the norm. With the league enforcing fines on those kind of hits and pushing for more lower body contact it reduces the risk of Lacy missing time too. My thinking is that come draft time if you have Lacy you will be able to handcuff him a lot easier than you would Arian Foster. Foster is more well known to miss more than one game if he goes down making his handcuff more of a higher reach in drafts, where Lacy's guy would be a little lower possibly and he could miss less time. I dont think Marshawn's handcuff would make as big as an impact if he misses time, where Starks in GB is a pretty solid back for when Lacy missed time. Just my 2 cents."
fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,ISXXVII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:24 2015 UTC,Turbin had always done decent when Lynch is out. Just as good as starks in an offense that will still run the ball.

My advice is, if he falls and he's hand's down the best player for you to take, you roll the dice. But, if there's a back or two still on the board that you feel can be just as productive if both players play 16 games, then I'd probably go with the other back."
fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,jokeAlmanac,3,Tue Jul 21 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem is I really don't like anyone other than Charles. I can't remember a year where I thought the 1st round rb's were so weak. AP didn't play last year, Marshawn/Arian/Forte have mileage, the reigning rushing champ is on a team with 2 other very talented rbs(and as an Eagles fan I know Mathews and Sproles will get some love from Chip this year), Shady had 300+ carries last year, seemed to take a step back, and now has a worse line and offense, Bell is suspended 3 games and Denver has so many RBs that I can't imagine using a 1st round pick on Anderson.  Really hoping for a later first round pick so I can justify taking a receiver, but gotta prepare for everything."
fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,OatmealApocalypse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"If you feel this way, just take the WR. If you have the #1 pick, sure, take Charles. But no one is going to (rightly) crucify you for taking Antonio Brown at #3, especially if you're in a PPR league."
fantasyfootball,3e3v3m,v89_cs,2,Tue Jul 21 20:42:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's just a weird year in general, the consensus #1 is suspended 3 games, AP sat out an entire year, Demarco changed teams after being the best rb in the league, and Shady switched teams after being arguably the best rb in the league the year before. Considering I think AP/Demarco/Shady are 3 top 5 talent rb's it's odd to see all 3 of them be in such questioning scenarios."

My worries on him don't stem from him being the starter (which I believe he will be no question), or that he will get a decent work load (15-18 touches/gm).   Its that the Jags are horrendous (Gerhart didnt crack 55yds in a game once last year). They have been towards the bottom of the league in rushing yards and TDs for what, 5 straight years? RBs always suffer the most when an offense struggles. Also, their schedule is brutal and I don't see them even competing in any of their first 4 games (CAR, MIA, NE, INDY). Once they get down early, Yeldon will be an afterthought."
fantasyfootball,3e3buo,FFMonstar,7,Tue Jul 21 18:22:19 2015 UTC,"All valid points, but I would counter ""Gerhart didnt crack 55yds in a game once last year"" by pointing out Denard Robinson, when given 15+ touches had 60, 94, 108 and 127 yards in those games. I think Yeldon's build and his experience as a RB (whereas Denard was a running QB in college) may make him more suited to the NFL RB grind. And, I have to assume the offense will be better (Bortles and those young WRs back) could mean Yeldon is poised to be very productive if healthy and given opportunities, vs. Gerhart."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,DrunkenMonkey03,4,Tue Jul 21 12:56:52 2015 UTC,"I definitely like Antonio brown at this pick. By 15 you could still have McCoy, or Anderson. If Hill is the best back available it wouldn't be a terrible pick. But that'd probably mean another elite WR fell to you like you said with julio. I think I'd rather start with Brown/julio over brown/hill"
fantasyfootball,3e24je,Bronc27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:08 2015 UTC,So you think of McCoy or CJ is there it's a no brainier at 15? I honestly think in comfortable playing Miller/Morris/Forsett as my RB1 and trying to scoop up Bell/Ellington/Stewart/Gore later on.
fantasyfootball,3e24je,DrunkenMonkey03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a no brainer. Depends on who falls. Let's say the 5 backs (AP, Lacy, Charles, Lynch, Bell) go before your first pick. You take brown. So that leaves 8 more players to be taken before your second round.   Foster is definitely one. Murray, Forte will likely also be taken. Gronk, Dez, Demaryius, maybe Odell, and McCoy which leave you with a choice of CJ or an elite WR like julio. Can't go wrong.   I wouldn't worry about positions so much and just make a top 15 list. Whoever they leave you go with. If it ends up wr/wr that's not a problem. But I have a hard time putting Hill in my top 15. If there's a run on RBs between picks 7-14 you'll have your pick of your favorite elite wide out. Nothing wrong with rolling with those mid round rbs. I love forsett, ingram, ellington, stewart, miller this year."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,Bronc27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:35 2015 UTC,Yes agreed love those later round backs. Anyways yes I am assuming that the top 5 backs are gone. So I would have to pick between Brown/Forte/Foster/Anderson. I would probably pull the trigger on Anderson if he fell to round 2.
fantasyfootball,3e24je,DrunkenMonkey03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:35 2015 UTC,"If he fell to round 2 i think you HAVE to pull the trigger. He should be a beast, in any format. hill should be good standard league, but will likely have little to no usage in the pass game, so less valuable in PPR."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd take Forte or AB. I seem to be higher on Forte than most people though. I know they had a change in coaching, but I still like him as Cutler's #1 ""oh shit the play is broken and I need to dump the ball"" option."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,DrKoooolAid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:27 2015 UTC,Forte has that PPR value. But I wouldn't draft him personally until 3rd round.  Am that bearish on Forte this year lol

fantasyfootball,3e24je,MF_Mood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"First, the Cowboys offense as a whole is very good. Their run blocking is exceptional, and if Randle can take the reins against unimpressive McFadden, he's looking at 1200 all purpose yards. Yeldon is a rookie for starters, but that's not why I don't like him. He has to battle Denard Robinson for the starting role, which, even if he gets it, is the starting spot for the Jaguars. Seldom have I been worried about playing against a Jaguars starter. There will be less goal line work for Yeldon than Randle assuming they both win the starting job. The Jags will often be in catch-up mode which means little running work. But this is all guesswork and if Yeldon wins the starting job and Randle doesn't then all of my theories go to shit"

I'm in one of those leagues too so I'm kind of dealing with the same issue and draft placement.   The way I see it, it's better to have a good core of WRs than a bunch of RBs you don't really want. Plus, Yeldon/Spiller should be available at your next pick. Cooks, Benjamin, and Matthews will not be however  But honestly, if you could I would draft Cooks and Mathews/Benjamin. You have to have a flex anyway and your RBs will be shit since you waited this long to get one. I would wait until the 5th to draft a RB like Abdullah or Tevin Coleman or Crowell"

I do think stewart has the most upside, but his lasts 3 years he has played: 13, 6, and 9 games. and he will be taking on a bigger load? Idk you have confidence him increasing his load while simultaneously decreasing his health issues.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,chedbomb,2,Tue Jul 21 15:41:10 2015 UTC,"I don't buy the love for Stewart, especially with this list in any PPR format.  When he was the clear starter in Carolina for 8 games last year he was, well, a solid replacement for on a bye week.  11.8 pts/gm.  Ellington had 13.2 pts/gm, or 12% more.  Stewart has played 16 games once in the last 5 seasons.  He's been injury prone while being the backup that gets fewer carries.  Why should he we expect him to be healthy as a starter with a heavier work load?  To top that off, Cam Newton earned half of Carolina's rush TD's last season.    Until we hear something different from Dallas, Randle is the top risk/reward pick here.  Ellington's consistency in the pass game makes him second in my book.  I might put Stewart 3rd because of job security when he is healthy, just because the playing time for Yeldon and Spiller is still very clouded.  Spiller might have the 2nd most potential of the group for this season for .5 PPR, but we know the least about his playing time."

You just need to go in knowing that you're going to have to draft maybe 6 or 7 RBs later on so you can hopefully get someone who pays off.  Personally I'd rather pick up a RB in the first just so you know you'll have at least one solid guy, and you're not forced to run a WR in the flex if you find yourself with other options."

It's a dynasty, but I've got Haden, Verrett, and Trufant so I'm not hurting for youth."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,jarydmidas,2,Tue Jul 21 14:31:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar league, and I remember Leodis having an awesome year last year. I'd go Leodis, then Tillman."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,jarydmidas,2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"That is definitely unique. My keeper league (5 keepers this year) is transitioning to full idp this year, with CB/S, LB, DT/DE slots.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,IronPirate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:35 2015 UTC,Late round. Went heavy WR in a 14 man ppr league. Need a 2nd back. Options are:   Tevin Coleman Isaiah Crowell Chris Ivory Devonta Freeman Shane Vereen Ameer Abdullah Charles Sims Doug Martin Darrren McFadden Bishop Sankey
fantasyfootball,3e24je,jabroni33,3,Tue Jul 21 14:48:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with Allaboutdatbass on a lot of his points, though I'd argue that Martin has the most upside cause we've seen it once before. I like Vereen quite a bit this year, I'm not sure Andre Williams or Rashad Jennings will siphor many carries. Ivory is intriguing, but depending on where you're at in the draft you could probably wait and take him later. I do like Abdullah, but I think Joique will keep his production down this year more than people think. I wouldn't touch McFadden in this group.  If you were on the clock and these were your options, I'd draft Vereen. Martin is tempting, but like Ivory, there's a chance you could still draft him later since he's left such a bad taste in so many mouths."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,jarydmidas,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:28 2015 UTC,"I like vereen too, but am just nervous about him because Jennings is also a very capable receiver, which is vereen's main jam. I think that whole backfield will give each RB good games, but may see that none are very consistent.  I definitely think martin is the best week 1 option. The second half of the season is Abdullah, imo. so depends on what the rest of your roster looks like as to whether you want to draft upside or not."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:06 2015 UTC,All good points. Would be a shame if Vereen leaves the NE backfield just to run into another situation where any given week can feature a different guy.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,Precookedcoin,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"I think abdullah has the most upside. Or maybe Martin. I know, I've been burned by martin too, but he is the only one on this list who is going to be a starter in week 1 and not in some form of a committee. Ivory may also be an interesting choice. Will likely be week1 starter in run heavy system, but i think there will be some competition for carries there. Since it is PPR, Vereen may also be a solid choice.  I like coleman, but think him and freeman will be back and forth, which will limit them both. Browns will go with hot hand so crowell will likely have good weeks and invisible weeks. I would draft David Cobb over sankey."

Not sure who is going to be there.  I picked Luck with the 15th pick and I normally don't do that but it's July. I don't know how CJ Anderson will look in camp or if Hill will be on a RBBC or if Jordy will respond to his injury.   I think I might skip RB until the 5th/6th round if Hyde doesn't fall to me."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,otherfuckinTerps,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make an argument for Crowell.  Yes, the addition of Duke Johnson may fret, but I think that out of everyone he would be right there with Vereen on points (if not higher)  He's a good runner and remember the O-line was injured last year.  He was a good RB2/Flex last year and I feel that he will do even better this year. Yes there is a possibility this can be a RBBC, but I think out of this group Crowell is one of the few with the highest floor."

Spiller has proven he isn't a feature back, although he has some upside. Ellington will have a reduced role, and that offense is anemic as we've seen in the past. Stewart could do well, though I don't like the Carolina offense enough. Lions have addressed their o line issue, and they have their star WR back. That offense will put up the most points out of the teams for which the listed RBs play, and at this moment Bell has unquestioned control of early down and goal line work. He can also catch the ball well. That's my two cents"

If Abdullah does well in the passing situations and change of pace work then that's fine, but a back his size won't take over the main role.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,salamander-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah Brees no question for me. Big Ben put up his best fantasy season of his career, and Brees put up the worst of his last 4 years. Brees still had the better season.  Brees did lose Graham, but Graham wasn't really the offense. If you watch the Saints, they love to keep in in the air and spread it around. Graham's points mainly came off of a few big plays each game."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,dakunism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:13 2015 UTC,Ben is going to approach top 3-4 QB this year and is going as late as round 8 in most of my mocks. food for thought
fantasyfootball,3e24je,salamander-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:53 2015 UTC,Just knowing that he has Brown to throw to is really swaying my decision.
fantasyfootball,3e24je,otherfuckinTerps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:11 2015 UTC,The thing is..both will throw for 4k yards+ and 30+ tds.  Breeds will probably throw for a few hundred more yards and a few extra tds. Thats like 30-40 more points over the course of a season..but ben can be picked several rounds later. I love value at the qb and te positions. Wr is where I like to make flashy picks. Rbs I reserve for high floor safe picks. Just personal preference.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:17 2015 UTC,"I'd go Kelvin over all of them. Then based on your needs go RB or WR. For RB I like L Murray, Hyde, Yeldon. For WR I like Allen, Cooper, Watkins."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:43 2015 UTC,Why do you have Watkins so high? Most people have him 6th or 7th on this list. I'm hoping to draft Cooper and Watkins because I'm pretty sure Benjamin and Hyde will be off the board in two picks
fantasyfootball,3e24je,otherfuckinTerps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Cooper has all the upside of Watkins with the bonus of Carr actually not looking horrible, but I like Watkins more than him just because we've seen what he can do. We know that he can ball out and throw up those 100+ yard games.  We don't really know what Cooper is going to do in Oakland, and San Diego WRs are like NE RBs. It's anyone's guess as to who will do well there. So I like Watkins more than either of them at this moment.  I don't think he'll be super consistent, and ideally he'd be taken as a WR3, but out of those guys I think he's the best WR option. So it's not that I'm super high on him, more that I'm kind of down on the rest.  Hyde is in theory in a great spot at the moment, but I'm staying a little wary on him. I don't know that we've seen enough of his play to feel confident saying he'll do well. His situation alone puts him ahead of Murray for me, though.  Murray I feel might be more talented than Hyde from what we've seen, but with Helu and Richardson looming... I just don't know how guaranteed it is that he'll get to be a 3-down back. Neither of those guys have been impressive historically, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some 3rd down and goal line work taken from Murray.  Then I'm just not drafting a rookie RB in the first 4 rounds. Yeldon's not in an awful spot, but I've been burned on enough rookie RBs that weren't in awful spots that I really think twice now."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:37 2015 UTC,OK yeah. I don't even know what to do with this team. 14th pick in a 14 man league. My first two were OBJ and Luck because everyone else scared me. I don't like having this draft via email 2 months before the season starts. How am I supposed to take Jeremy Hill with my first pick if it's not even training camp? Same thing with Murray and CJ Anderson and McCoy. New teams or young. The only two WRS available were AJ Green or Jordy Nelson and I'm wary of both.  So I've got Luck and OBJ in a 3 wr 2 rb league. I really think I'm going to take Watkins and Cooper and hold off on RBs another round. Thanks!
fantasyfootball,3e24je,evxcxrostx7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah 14 team leagues are brutal. Did a similar draft last year. I'd agree with that, just go all out and finish out your WRs. I feel like at this point the RBs are enough of a gamble that you might as well wait. If Hyde's there I'd obviously take him, but otherwise I'd sit."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,salamander-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:25 2015 UTC,I would DEFINITELY get two RB's. The RB's this year are soo weak and if you could get two of the top 5 you'd be set.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"I see no reason that Bell wont be just as dominant as last year, but if you pick him up, you'll have to grab DeAngelo Williams at some point as well because of the suspension.  Personally, I'd take Lynch."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,Henry_RutherfordHill,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:47 2015 UTC,"I'd go Lynch, personally. I'm a big advocate of not losing your league in the first few rounds, and while Bell should be a monster when he gets back, you'll be playing without your first rounder until then.  If you do go Bell, I'd reach for Tre Mason. He should put up numbers until Gurley is healthy. I hate to waste a semi-early pick on someone you don't think will be playing the whole season, but it might be worth burning your 6th or 7th to net you a couple wins early in the season. And there's always the possibility Mason continues to impress. It's definitely a tough call."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,TheBigBrainOnBrett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:43 2015 UTC,Good point. When you consider my 2nd and 3rd picks there's a lot of uncertainty on who's going to be there. You can certainly lose your league missing on those next 2 after Bell or Lynch.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,TheBigBrainOnBrett,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"You're not over-reacting, there is clear logic in that pick.  However, I think the drop off between having the #1 QB and the #10 QB isn't as much as the #1 RB and the #10RB.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,Henry_RutherfordHill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I think picking Rodgers with your first would be a big mistake.  I just don't see the value in going QB in the first three rounds. You're going to set yourself back when there's plenty of talent later (Ryan, Stafford, Romo, Rivers).

fantasyfootball,3e24je,ReaganxSmash,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:50 2015 UTC,Yes. I'm also in a 6-pt pass TD league and I don't think it's worth a first round pick at all this year for a QB

fantasyfootball,3e24je,ReaganxSmash,3,Tue Jul 21 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well, most places that I've looked Murray is not a 2nd pick. It typically goes Charles, AP, Brown/ Lacy.  That being said, you're probably still looking at taking Lacy, Brown, or Bell.  They're all solid picks and I feel like it's a really tough call. I'd lean more towards Brown, just because he's going to get a lot of receptions and WR'S are less likely to be injured."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,HandsyPriest,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:33 2015 UTC,Ok cool thank you for the input. I'd be happy with either. Locking up a workhorse RB like Lacy is always nice but you are right about Browns PPR advantage and lower injury risk.  Can't go wrong I suppose.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,Henry_RutherfordHill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:19 2015 UTC,Rams Defense vs. Bills Defense  The Rams added Ayers and Fairley which will be big for their front seven.  The Bills got rid of Kiko who could've boosted their defense and also lost Searcy and Spikes.
fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:34 2015 UTC,I'd personally go with STL but Rex can sure coach a D. Hard to argue against the additions for STL though.
fantasyfootball,3e24je,GoldenRy007,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"As a Pats fan, I'd go Bills. Their front 7 is disgusting, Kiko didn't play last season and they were still phenomenal. Rex Ryan is a huge addition to their defense. As much as I hate the guy, you can't deny his talent with defenses.  On paper losing Searcy and Spikes sounds like it will hurt, but as a Pats fan I don't think Spikes has ever been a phenomenal LB. He hits like a truck, but doesn't play too well in coverage and honestly isn't the best tackler. There's a reason nobody picked him up after the Pats cut him again.  The loss of Searcy should be masked by further improved d-line play, forcing quicker passes, which is fine because the Bills CBs are pretty scary. They're not Revis+Cromartie level, but there's not anyone there you can look at and say ""Oh, we'll pick on him."" (Rex is a wizard with blitzes and keeping the opponent on their toes.)  That said, the Rams defense should be very good again this year too, I think it's a top 3 vs top 5 scenario here; you can't really go wrong IMO."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,ladygagadisco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"12th pick in 12 team league.

Do I go for a QB or grab the best WR? I'm leaning towards just getting whichever player is projected to get the most points but if I go with a QB then my WRs this season will be crap. Any thoughts?"
fantasyfootball,3e24je,FFS__Dan,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"Go WR. There will still be great QBs after the 3rd round like Roethlisberger, maybe Brees, Stafford, and Rivers."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,JCH1423,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, hit the turn with WR>WR, if there's still guys you like. I really don't like any of the WRs after the 4th round this year. You can probably snag an above average QB in the 5th on the 5/6 turn. On fantasyfootballcalculator's ADPs (players mocking there tend to be low on QBs, so take this with a grain of salt) guys like Brees and Roethlisberger are going around there, then you can complement them in the 7/8 or 9/10 turn with someone like Stafford, Eli, Tannehill, or Rivers.  Look for value picks at WR though, because while you're stacked at RB, your WR corps won't be phenomenal. I'd recommend looking at someone like Steve Smith, maybe Stevie Johnson will have a bigger role in SD. Look for those late round guys with lots of potential, because I don't think you need to worry too much about finding a ton of extra RB depth."

If I'm taking a TE this early, it's so I don't have to deal with the weekly headache of wondering which TE I should be starting, and that's still a legitimate possibility with Kelce for me.  Otherwise I'd snag either Ellington or Stewart there, try to salvage your runningbacks.

fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,2,Tue Jul 21 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"According to the link i posted above, here is who available in 6th round or later that i like (in standard leagues):  6.04 - Yeldon - May not get great stats, but volume should be there  6.07 - Blount - Has almost no competition on roster (i refuse to believe grey or white are real threats). Big Bill is always tricky with his RBs though, and Blount has almost no receiving game, but should be locked in as redzone RB.  7.06 - Abdullah - May not start the year as starter, but will take it at some point. Will be hard to rely on before he is the main man, but will be good once he takes control  11.07 - David Cobb - Sankey will start the year probably, but was a train wreck last year and Greene retired. He WILL start sooner than later (maybe even week 1), and may likely be able to provide RB2 numbers at 11th round price.  Personal deep pick - 14.01 - Cameron Artis-Payne - Apparently has the lead in the race to backup Jonathan Stewart, one of the most injury prone RBs in the league. Could get someone who starts many games on the year in the 14th round.  In PPR, I also love Helu in the 14th round."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,Bluemoonclay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"As a Pats fan, I totally agree with your asessment of his role in the backfield. However, I'm also drafting against 9 other Pats fans so he will be drafted way too early. As will Edelamn and Brady etc. Certainly high on Yeldon as well, I think he presents good value in the 6th."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,2,Tue Jul 21 15:09:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with that. I think people are scared by Gearhart's flop last year as a premier back on that team, but he seems to be FAR more talented than Toby, so I like taking him as low end rb2. shouldn't bring you lower than rb2 returns, and has potential for more. anytime you can draft a player at their floor, I'm in."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I will certainly be able to grab a top tier Wideout in the 2nd. I'm slightly hesitant on Megatron. Had him last year and the sting of those injuries is still with me. Really high on Nelson, would love to snag him in the 2nd. Who would you like better in the 3rd, Gordon or Miller?"
fantasyfootball,3e24je,Bluemoonclay,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"I really like Gordon. The staff clearly likes him by taking him so early and i refuse to believe woodhead or oliver are really threats to workload. Miller has been continually undercut by his coaching staff, whether it be Daniel Thomas, Moreno, etc., and they just drafted Jay Ajayi. I think he has a high ceiling, if his coaches would put full faith in him, but they just never seem to do that.  having said that if you disagree and go with miller, i wouldn't think its a bad pick."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,rageaholic55,0,Tue Jul 21 15:35:57 2015 UTC,"11th pick in a 12 team .5 PPR with 2rb,2wr,1flex. What do you think is the best strategy this year? I've been able to get some combo of DT, Julio, OBJ, Megatron, and sometimes Dez with my first two picks. Is that worth trying to snag Miller, Ingram, Murray with my 3rd and 4th pick? Or should I grab Foster/Anderson/Forte and one of those WR's with the first two and go Ingram/hopkins, for example, in the 3rd and 4th rounds?"
fantasyfootball,3e24je,zissou52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:21 2015 UTC,"In 0.5 ppr i like trying to grab one of the RBs that is heavily involved in the passing game. My reasoning is that all WRs catch passes, so ppt doesn't differentiate them as much, but not all RBs catch passes to the save level. Someone like forte or justin forsett could be a HUGE upgrade over someone like Jeremy Hill or lamar miller who aren't typically used in the passing game often. The difference there could literally be 80 catches vs 20, so 60 extra catches = 30 extra points on the year, = 2 extra points a week. That's just my opinion. If you can get forte or frost there I would love that. You can still get an elite receiver in round 2 pick 2. As far as WRs go, volume plays more of a role than usual. People like Cobb become elite WRs, because they will almost guarantee around 100 catches. Obviously if you can get someone like Demaryius who will have volume and TDs in the first, do that. But I think at least one of the first two rounds needs to be a true 3 down back."

fantasyfootball,3e24je,ImAllAboutDatBass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"If you can get DT and Dez with your 1/2, I'd have a hard time passing that up.  Foster's injury history scares me; Anderson seemed to look good at the end of the year last year, but its like 3 years in a row a Denver running back with almost no history of success is being taken in the 1st round, but this has the best potential to outperform expectations (which are admittedly high if being taken 1st round).  Forte will probably do fine at the position."
fantasyfootball,3e24je,rageaholic55,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Dez looks more and more out of reach with every mock I do, I don't think he'll be there."

fantasyfootball,3e2n99,Bentumbo,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:21 2015 UTC,Im liking Justin Forsett this year. Forte just caught a ton of passes with much better receivers under a Trestman offense.   Im looking at 80 catches for forsett if he can stay healthy and on the field

fantasyfootball,3e2n99,MyNameIsPitt,2,Tue Jul 21 17:00:48 2015 UTC,IIRC his rookie season he had that massive bomb against the Colts in game 1 and didn't really do much after that. He caught another TD against the Jags and broke his hand on the play and he sat out the rest of the season. So it wasn't too great his rookie year but still not horrible

I expect Steve Smith to put up 80-90 catches and be a true #1. I also believe Forsett gets upwards of 50 catches"
fantasyfootball,3e2n99,otherfuckinTerps,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:07 2015 UTC,Perriman is only the 4th wr selected in the first round in franchise history. Wouldn't say they missed on Torrey. Mark Clayton was in a terrible offense and relied on way too much. Travis Taylor is the only real miss. To say they consistently miss on first round wr's is a pretty stupid statement.
fantasyfootball,3e2n99,konstantinox,4,Tue Jul 21 17:32:17 2015 UTC,Torrey was selected in the 2nd round
fantasyfootball,3e2n99,expectantsneer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he's close enough. By ""1st round"" he means rookies who are drafted early to be the main guy"
fantasyfootball,3e2n99,otherfuckinTerps,2,Tue Jul 21 18:30:35 2015 UTC,I also believe Forsett gets upwards of 50 catches   Don't be surprised if rookie Buck Allen (USC) eats a good chunk of that.    Allen caught 63 passes for 710 yards and two touchdowns over the past two seasons. That included a career-high 41 catches for 458 yards and a touchdown last season.

fantasyfootball,3e3oaf,OfficialScott,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"Justin Hunter only got 68 targets last year, and the majority of those will probably go to the new number 2 WR. I'd put my money on that being Harry Douglas, though it could be DGB if he's ahead of schedule. It's very possible that the number 2 WR for Tennessee gets more targets this year, but it'll take at least 100 targets before I'm even slightly interested. This is a contender for worst offense in the NFL so the TDs probably won't be there either. The one savior would be consistent garbage time points, and plenty of throwing while trailing. However, I expect the Titans to try and limit Mariota's attempts in year 1.  That said, if DGB gets first team snaps I'd be interested based on pure upside. He's very far from Calvin Johnson, who he's occasionally compared to, but the ceiling is high enough even though I do have my doubts about him."
fantasyfootball,3e3oaf,eme_pirrade,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"DGB will get so many targets its silly. Remember Eli just throwing every single ball to Odell drive after drive, game after game, to the point of laughable predictibility? DGB will be the same...but better!! ;)"

fantasyfootball,3e27u9,GOTaSMALL1,6,Tue Jul 21 16:14:42 2015 UTC,"He may be, but especially in PPR format, Faulk probably had the best 3-4 year run when he first got to the Rams.  If he had a functional offense for his first couple years with the Colts he would likely have matched LT's career numbers if not surpassed them.   LT certainly has the edge in TD's, and probably has the single greatest fantasy season by anyone ('06) but Faulk pulling down 80 receptions for 5 straight years is a big deal."

Then Tomlinson was legendary for a really long time. Clinton Portis was a long-time stud as well. Tiki Barber too, he was kind of a late bloomer but was really good.  Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates dominated the TE position for the entirety of the 00s so not much changed there by the end of the decade haha.  At WR Randy Moss and T.O., Torry Holt. Though Moss had some dark years in Oakland, you probably know of the record breaking things he did in New England. I feel like Holt is kind of a forgotten man but from 2000-07 this was his average 94-1384-8. Pretty impressive  There are a bunch of guys missing, especially in the early years before I really got in but these are definitely some of the biggest and best.  Quick edit: Can't believe I forgot Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne. Harrison was the real star but Wayne was kind of like Randall Cobb or Emmanuel Sanders to Jordy/Demaryius. and obviously Peyton along with them and Edgerrin James at RB.

It felt game breaking that a QB could produce basically like a QB and a RB combined with one slot, people were talking about making rule changes for QB running stats.

fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,phileagles,12,Tue Jul 21 17:36:40 2015 UTC,But everyone was laughing when someone picked up the Chiefs off waivers and they got 20 points a week. So many special team td's that year...

No ones RBs or receivers were good enough to make up for those three giving me an average of twenty points every game."
fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,phileagles,5,Tue Jul 21 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"By ESPN standard scoring, Seattle D was only 3rd best behind Bills and Eagles and barely ahead of Texans. There were also 7 of the 16 weeks where they were single digit points including 4 at 5 points or fewer and 1 of which being in the negatives. So I doubt you actually had 8 point leads every week. Especially considering Seattles best week (20 pts) came in Week 17 which a lot of leagues don't even play (I gave you the benefit of the doubt on that one).   For comparison, I streamed defenses last year and my combined defensive scoring for the year was 179 points which was 9 points higher than the highest defense of last year and 29 points higher than the Seahawks. Unless you somehow found a team during Seattle's bye week that gave you 30 points, I scored more points on defense from streaming than you did with an 8th/9th round pick. There's a reason people laugh when people draft defenses early."

You certainly didn't have to reach into the 8th round to pick the #1 defense last year!"
fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,axxl75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:35 2015 UTC,I edited my other post.  It was the 2013 season not 2014.  and they were dominant that year. I am pretty sure they were way better than any defense that year but I cannot find the numbers.  Also my league is 2 dollars a transaction.  so everytime you cut and pick up a defense its four dollars.  No one wants to spend 40 some dollars on their defense over the course of the season.
fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,phileagles,2,Tue Jul 21 19:10:58 2015 UTC,"Assuming you're telling the truth and not covering to make your other post look better, it's still not necessarily great to take a defense that early. You got lucky that they did so well, but you still weren't scoring +8 points per week on everyone. Defenses are so unpredictable preseason, and you could've gotten the Chiefs or Panthers in the final round (Chiefs did better than Seattle depending on your scoring). Do you not have access to your old leagues? Pretty sure if it's ESPN or Yahoo you can look at your league from 2013 when you sign in. You lucked out, and that's great. It's not like every other player you could've potentially picked in the 8th/9th would've been a great pick up so to each his own.   Additionally, personal preference but I've played in a league that did money per transaction and I absolutely hate it. Feels like you're being punished for being an active player and decentivizes teams doing poorly from trying to improve. I don't see why people enjoy playing in leagues where you either have to be extremely lucky in the draft or wealthy enough to not care about dropping $40+ on a league for potential to win rather than let people use the waiver wires normally."
fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,axxl75,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried about looking good to people I don't know.  I was going to take them again last year but someone actually did it in front of me.  And if I see a player I want I am going to draft them.  I was the last pick and the guy I picked with them was mark ingram.  Seattle's defense would not have been there the next time I picked.  And yeah I found the stats and the chiefs were better than SEA by quite a bit.    As far as the pay per transaction, I don't really like it either.  In one of my other leagues we are doing a blind auction waiver wire.  I think this is the best way to do a waiver system because the waiver order system rewards teams for having a bad first week by letting them get the guys like Justin forsett who come out week one on fire."
fantasyfootball,3e2x1b,phileagles,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Auction waivers are my favorite, but it's hard to do them in casual leagues where people don't really understand them. In leagues where people are all on point they're awesome.   Reverse order of standings waivers is good if you want a decent parity league where everyone has a good chance of beating everyone else. It does reward the worse teams but that's not necessarily a bad thing if your goal is to keep things as competitive as possible from last place to first place.   Waiver queue (not sure what it's actually called) is good because it makes people think about their picks instead of just picking people for the heck of it. If you spend your 2nd waiver slot on a random kicker or someone who might be okay this week maybe you won't get the breakout stud OBJ next week when you have 8th overall waiver pick. If you decide to forego waivers this week and hold onto your high pick then you have a good chance of grabbing that breakout player.   There's no real best or worst way to do waivers. It all depends on your league and what you want to achieve. I will say though that any system that actually penalizes you from using the waivers is a silly system. It completely removes lower teams from contention unless they want to throw money away and turns your 10 team league into a 5 team league pretty quickly.   The funny thing though is that if you actually didn't care about looking good to people you didn't know, you wouldn't have commented on how you were making all your leaguemates cry after they laughed at you for taking Seattle that early. No one cares who you picked or when you picked them. Who you pick and when you pick them is entirely up to you, but it's also entirely up to other people if they want to laugh at you for picking the person you did. The reason for the downvotes isn't because you picked them so early, it's because you acted smug like you made a smart choice grabbing them so early (even if it turned out right it doesn't necessarily make it the right move at the time) and then lied about the fact you were getting +8 pts every week.   But yeah, it just seems silly that you guys are so into doing things like auction waivers to reduce the amount of luck involved in waivers yet keep transaction fees which put WAY too much emphasis on luck in the draft. If you want a money sink just raise the buy in cost or do side bets that are actually fun and don't penalize people for trying. Low scoring team gives high scoring team $5 for the week or something where you are actually encouraged to improve your team every week would be so much better in a competitive environment."

People seem to still have trouble coming up with the money even when it's $25.  This year everybody that pays will get one keeper so maybe that'll be an incentive to throw in.
fantasyfootball,3e36k3,Colinbedr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"So I had the same problem two years ago. It's super annoying badgering people to pay, it's draining and you feel like an asshole. So last year I instituted this rule and it worked like a charm.   If you don't pay me the league fees by the Tuesday after Week 5 I will do two things: 1. I will lock your team; this means you cannot do any waiver wire moves, or trades -- 2. I will put all of your starters on the bench so if you do not pay me by Sunday you will lose. Your team will stay that way until you pay.   If someone still won't pay they are out of the league next year, but never had that issue. It's an incredible feeling when someone realizes they can't make a waiver move and their team is locked, they pay up extremely quickly then."

fantasyfootball,3e36k3,Jk186861,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"For starters, create a facebook group or something just so that everyone is sure to get every message.  Set a rule, no drafting until the league is completely paid up.   Create a spreadsheet or something denoting who has and hasn't paid. Then post pictures of said spreadsheet. Public shaming works.  A good app you can use is Square Cash. If you have their email or phone number, you can request them directly. They can link their card to their account and pay you."

Only gave him a kicker & a defense.  Got the money pretty quick after that.  I will never be in that situation again."

I deal with this every year in my league. A couple guys will drag their feet and forget to pay, but I'm not going to kick them out of the league, especially since I don't want to struggle looking for a good replacement. You just have to keep bugging them until they pay. No easy way around it"
fantasyfootball,3e36k3,SkizzM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying that if you don't pay, then you don't draft which is much easier said than done depending how much the entry is. As the commish, my focus is to maintain a fair and FUN atmosphere. Kicking people out of the league isn't fun for anyone.  I personally run a $100 buy-in, $2 drop/add league, and not many people want to commit that much $$ against a bunch of seasoned FF vets.   I've created a rule that if you don't pay for the buy in before week 1, the rest of the league can set your line up until you do. This removes the need to kick and the pain of finding other people that I really don't even want in the league. It also gives the late paying parties a chance to do so, while creating a fun mechanic for the rest of the league in the case it does happen."

If your league is run well you probably have some people who want in that you don't have room for; so actively maintain a waiting list. I don't set draft order till I have everyone's money and if I have to ask more than 3 times you'll get the boot in favor of the first name on the waiting list who has cash ready when I ask for it.  You got booted, suck it up and take your spot at the bottom of the waiting list."

My leagues are pay before draft, pay by mid-season, and pay as soon as all transaction fees/winnings have been determined.  It's not a problem for any of them, but you need to make everyone in the league aware of what the policy is."

fantasyfootball,3e36k3,bassdrop360,0,Tue Jul 21 22:08:11 2015 UTC,"Here is what I do in my league that I am the commish of:   Accept only these 2 forms of payment. Cash or Venmo. No PayPal or checks. The utilization of Venmo will eliminate a few typical excuses an owner will have for why they haven't/can't pay. First, ""I have/forgot to go to the ATM or the bank first, and I can't either get there or its closed."" Venmo is an app, the majority of FF players have a smart phone. Venmo is available on both OS & Android. Venmo is linked directly to your bank account and it sends $$ to other Venmo users free of charge and right away (similar to a text). Then the money sent is taken out of the persons account in a couple of days. So if they have a bank account and a smart phone then they can have Venmo and they won't have an excuse. There is no excuse they can say. You could be sitting right next to them and say ""There is your phone, go to your Google/Apple store, download Venmo, it's free of charge. Do you know your bank account number, OK here's how to setup Venmo to be linked directly to it. OK now send me your league dues."" And they will not even have a chance to have an excuse. Secondly, the choice of Venmo as opposed to PayPal or any other form of digital payment is because of the fact that Venmo sends money right away. With PayPal, you have to deposit from your bank account to your PayPal account, depending on your account that can take 1-4 BUSINESS days. That leaves unpaid owners with a plethora of excuses. ""The money hasn't hit my PayPal account yet."" ""I think there is a problem with my bank and PayPal, I deposited the funds to my PayPal and waited the 3 business days it said it would take to show up but it didn't show up."" etc.......Once again Venmo will eliminate this excuse as it will send the $$ immediately to your Venmo account. Set full payment date of by start of the draft. Any owner who hasn't paid in full by the start is auto drafted a K for their first pick and then their team is set to auto-draft by best available for the remainder of the draft. Some may think that the unpaid owner is still getting it easy by getting to autodraft, but they aren't because the majority of fantasy platforms (ESPN & Yahoo) will autodraft them best overall by what positional slots are available. So instead of them getting that sweet 9th or 10th round Flex player, they get a D/ST before they wanted to.  If post-draft, any unpaid player still hasn't paid in full, then they forfeit all and any games until paid in full. As Commish, you are able to edit scoring after match-ups, just edit their score to 0 pts so they don't even receive any points towards their running points forward accumulation throughout the season. This will prevent them winning a tie breaker for playoff seeding later in the year if that is one of your levels of settling tie breakers (depending on platform & league settings of course but after their overall W-L record many platforms have total points for as the next level of tie breaking.) Lastly, some may say that these types of regulations will disuade owners from playing. I say bullshit to that. If an owner won't play because they can't or won't pay then they aren't worthy to be in your league anyways. If you make your league fun (having active interest throughout the season AND offseason) then it won't be hard to find good quality owners in the chance that an owner never pays or never pays on time."
fantasyfootball,3e36k3,mdico91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:17 2015 UTC,"I can see people not wanting to use venmo, the fewer things that have access to my bank account the better. It really should just be cash at the draft for anyone with that concern. If the buy-in is an amount of money that isn't easily to come up with, they shouldn't be playing anyway. There's really no excuse to not have paid before the draft."
fantasyfootball,3e36k3,bassdrop360,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"the fewer things that have access to my bank account the better.    I can't agree with this line of thinking though. Venmo isn't going to steal your money there regulations in place preventing even something remotely close of that from happening so there should be zero worry. There aren't any automatic fees taken out, everything regarding withdrawing money from your account has to be physically authorized by the user. Yes I do agree with the obvious rule that if you don't have the money to play in a FF league then you shouldn't be playing in the first place."
fantasyfootball,3e2c9x,LawsBound,32,Tue Jul 21 12:31:44 2015 UTC,Dark Horse: Eli Manning
fantasyfootball,3e2c9x,Bentumbo,8,Tue Jul 21 13:17:02 2015 UTC,"Brees is by far the best bet, since his 4,952 yards last season were the lowest since 2010.  Luck is next, with his 4761 on 616 attempts.  I'm guessing he'll take another step up efficiency-wise, and his volume should stay the same or grow.  Rodgers is completely volume dependant.  If he throws 600 times next season, he could get 5500.  But if he throws as little as he did last season, it'll be almost impossible.  Peyton is a possibility, it really comes down to what Kubiak does with that offense and if Manning has another poor late season showing.  Matt Ryan seems like he could, but he seems to max out around 4700, and I think the Falcons want to actually have a decent running game this year which could limit his targets.  Brady is unlikely, since that offense loves the short passing and intermediate game, and Brady hasn't had a solid deep ball game since Moss was on the team.  Eli and Roethlisberger are maybes, since their new offenses have them throwing more and more efficiently than they have in the past.  I don't think Eli gets the volume, and I think Ben falls a bit short.  Stafford shouldn't throw for 5000, and if he does the Lions are screwed since Stafford is a fairly inefficient qb whose stats have gone down since the flukey 2011 season where passing offense spiked.  My dark horse is Flacco.  He threw 614 times two seasons ago, Trestman can inflate his passing numbers with checkdowns to rbs and tes, and that offense may end up doing a lot of downfield chucking."
fantasyfootball,3e2c9x,panchojulio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. I think the takeaway is that we won't see more than 1 or 2, if any, this season.   Flacco is horse dark as night. He's never even thrown for over 4k yards..."

fantasyfootball,3e2c9x,SandyDFS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Don't forget that Brees lost 2 of his top 3 receivers (Stills and Graham).  Those two combined for an average of 1800+ yards and 17 TDs per year in 2013 and 2014. That creates a huge hole in the WR corps and the Saints didn't do much to plug it.   I think Spiller and Cooks will help pick up some of that slack...  But I do not see Brees throwing for 5000 yards this year.

fantasyfootball,3e2c9x,Alex_the_White,2,Tue Jul 21 17:03:52 2015 UTC,Luck is a heavy favorite. Rodgers is actually not super likely because he doesn't throw a ton like Brees. He's just so efficient when he does throw. He only had 4381 yards last year.  Both Mannings are possible. Stafford is possible but a longshot. Darkhorse: Healthy Sam Bradford. Eagles had 5th most attempts last year and Sanchez/Foles combined for over 4500 yards.

During Bell's suspension your RBs would be very weak. If you pick Bell I would make sure to also pick DeAngelo Williams or Tre Mason.

Your RBs are solid. Jamaal is an obvious first pick that high, Jonathan Stewart will be good if he stays healthy, but if not, Gore should provide a high floor backup. He is good and he's on a good offense.   Your receivers are equally solid. Amari Cooper will probably be the wr1 in Oakland if things stay the way they are.

fantasyfootball,3e24ku,utfreak,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:50 2015 UTC,"Everything looks great until the DST/K picks. If you're doing a mock draft, a lot of times people will end up leaving before the draft is over. So then, a CPU takes over and autodrafts defenses and kickers. In real life, not many people are going to be taking DSTs and Ks in those rounds and you shouldn't be either. So just take that into account and realize that in a real draft, Perriman and Parker might not fall to you in the 13th and 15th rounds because people won't be wasting their earlier picks on DST/Ks."

fantasyfootball,3e24ku,utfreak,2,Tue Jul 21 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Not a bad draft man. I agree on people's statements about letting the defenses go and using that value for other positions. I think you got some decent value overall. I think it was a bit of a reach for Tannehill and you could have gotten him in rounds 8-10. I am also not a proponent of drafting a backup QB. More than likely Winston or someone with similar fantasy output will be on the waiver wire.  Here are my thoughts on your mid round picks. You could have gotten more for RB depth. Ellington has slight injury/workload concerns as does Rashad Jennings and that would signal that I would need better RB depth, just in case. I also don't believe in Sankey and if both of those guys go down, I'd hate to have to play Sankey every week.  I would have personally skipped Marshall and gotten another RB there as Alshon/Cobb is a good duo. Maybe look out for Miller, Spiller, Yeldon, Coleman, Randle, though I am unsure if they'll be around that late.   Just to clarify, I think you did a pretty good job but with your current RB corps it'd be a good idea to get more depth in case of injury or bust."
fantasyfootball,3e24ku,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:48 2015 UTC,But if I grabbed another RB instead of Marshall wouldn't that mean having a not too great Wr3? Yahoo standard is 2 rb and 3 wr.
fantasyfootball,3e24ku,Dispatcher9,2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"Right, that's true. I'm actually used to playing 2WR/ 2RB/1 Flex and I tend to forget that. This actually does support your choice better but I believe the value is still better if you go for another RB. I think that its a lot easier to find those decent WR3's than it is to find a reliable or potentially reliable RB in those rounds. I would rather go RB and then go for Landry, Robinson, or someone like Agholor, C. Johnson for my WR3"

Now I have to decide from one of these and I get him in the 12th:  Jordan Mathews   Martavius Bryant  Jonathan Stewart  Brandin Cooks  Travis Kelce
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Aceoangels,4,Tue Jul 21 12:20:42 2015 UTC,You're should just be looking for the best player available and it's Cooks.

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:52 2015 UTC,"I like all three of Mathews, Bryant and Cooks. I think Cooks is considered to be the most talented, and he has the best QB.  Mathews is also a viable choice, considering the offense that he's on."

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Larger_Than_Life,2,Tue Jul 21 12:32:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input - may I ask why you favor Jeffery over TY? I feel like TY has the far superior QB, and the higher ceiling, although Jeffery may have the lower floor of the two."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,RAVENS17d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:53:41 2015 UTC,"Hilton does have a great QB. But what I think hurts is that he has to share the load with a multi time All Pro that still produces in Andre Johnson, and the tight end duo of Allen and Fleener. Hilton will most likely lose a few targets. Alshon is the proven one on the Bears, while White is the rookie. In the games Alshon played without Marshall last year(three games) he had 12 catches for 184 yards and two TD's, and was targeted a total of 29 times. I think it all comes down to the fact that Hilton has to share it more, and Alshon has to share it less. I think Alshon has a lower ceiling but a higher floor then Hilton"

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,RAVENS17d,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:09:31 2015 UTC,Just remember its up to you. If you see more in Hilton there is no reason not to go with him. He has a higher ceiling then Alshon does. But he also has the lower floor so it could be either. He will most likely still have a fantastic season since he has been with luck since the beginning.

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,sportsfan101990,2,Tue Jul 21 12:49:41 2015 UTC,"I think I would keep Murray because you would get your first round pick instead of Charles right? So you might end up with Murray + McCoy/DeMarco/Julio etc instead of Charles. Also, it's the last year you can keep Charles, whereas if Murray breaks out you can have him again next year at a cheap price."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Larger_Than_Life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:46:51 2015 UTC,"Thats kind of what I was thinking too but with Ellington instead of Murray. I've already kept Ellington once so he has another 2 years. Murray still has all of them though. Cobb/Charles are unkeepable after this year but Cobb is fantastic value in the last round of the draft.  Looking at what players are going to be available in the first round it looks like Charles, Marshawn, Rodgers, DeMarco, Brees, McCoy, Peyton, AJ Green, Forte, Lacy, MegaTron, Julio, Graham and Foster. There could be others that aren't being kept that could be worth a look in the 1st round too like Gronk.

On one hand I want to say that Charles is easily the best talent that you have to choose from, and is in the conversation for #1 overall.  On the other hand, I really like the value of those two WRs at the end of your draft, and you can't keep Charles beyond this year anyway.  I think the cost of your league would determine this for me.  If it is expensive, I would be playing to win now and keep the single best player."

Julius Thomas for my 4.  Tannehill for my 8.  FJax for my 11.  Travis Kelce, Joseph Randle, and Martavis Bryant undrafted, so would be for my 16 (or 16 and 15 if I chose both).  I'm leaning Kelce and either McCoy or Peterson since I have tenth pick. But, I'm also intrigued by Tannehill (2qb, so an value is increased) and Randle. Thoughts?"

Beyond that, Julius Thomas is solid but you can get better value down the line, I wouldn't waste the 4 on him. Fuck Tannehill, and I'm a Fins fan. FJax is too old to waste a keeper pick on, if you really want him, he should still be available. I think Kelce is your best idea."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,NeilsErikTheRedd,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"So we've got the scarcity of the 2QB format but also the fact that it's only a 10-team league.  For that reason, I think you can throw Tannehill back into the pool and still end up with two very solid QBs.  Without seeing the full league's rosters, I would guess 7-8 teams keep a QB, which still leaves about 10 more viable guys to get your two from.    Keep AD and Randle (if you are able to wait and see that he wins the starting RB job in Dallas).  If you have to choose sooner, I would like Kelce there."

LeVeon Bell, CJ Anderson, Jeremy Maclin, Joseph Randle, Tony Romo.  I understand my third keeper after Bell and Anderson is going to be a reach, but I have to keep three and trust me I'm not in the worst position out of the teams in my league. But can I really keep Randle over Maclin? It'd give me three RBs right off the bat so I would be pretty much forced to take a WR with my first pick in the draft, but current ADPs typically have Randle going before Maclin. Maclin has the higher floor, I think, because he is absolutely locked in as the number one receiver in KC. What would you do? Safer pick of Maclin with a higher floor and not be shoehorned into drafting a WR in the draft or higher risk/higher reward of Randle?"
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Imperial10,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"Given what you posted about your draft slot, I feel much better about keeping Randle as my 3rd RB, and going WR/WR with back to back picks in the draft.

Also I wouldn't consider your keeper as a ""reach"". Since everyone has to keep 3 players it's more like those 36 players are off the board and the 4th round becomes the 1st.  I think you really need to have a feel for who is going to be around for you to draft to make this decision. I think I'd rather keep Randle in your shoes, but would draft Maclin if there is just not going to be any serviceable WR's.

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,FFS__Dan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"You have to keep Forte in .5 PPR, I think. He's the prototypical receiving back.  I'd hang on to Jordy too. I'd feel really good about going into the season knowing I have those 2 guys locked up."

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,dermaneek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:27 2015 UTC,I can keep one player and I lose the pick in the round I drafted him with. If he was a free agent I picked up then I lose the last round pick. I'm in a 12 team 0.5 ppr league. No specific point bonuses with a max of 18 players. I was leaning towards Brown but I feel like I can get someone else with the same level of production in the 2nd round still.  1st round Jamaal Charles  2nd round Antonio Brown  3rd round Andre Ellington  6th round Alshon Jeffery  Owen Daniels (FA)  Jarvis Landry (FA)  Martavis Bryant (FA)
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,FredFlanders,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:26 2015 UTC,"I would keep Alshon in the 6th, you have much better value than Charles and Brown."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,dub_nation11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely Jeffery or Brown.  I think the value at Jeffery makes him the better keep in all likelihood, but if you had a top 3 or so pick overall that might move in favor of Brown. Getting Brown about 15 picks later than his ADP is tremendous value, and having early picks in rounds 1 and 3 would give him a great complementary cast."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,reeljazz7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:53 2015 UTC,"I was leaning towards Brown but I feel like I can get someone else with the same level of production in the 2nd round still.   I think you're wrong.  Brown's ADP is WR1 and middle of the first round.  If you don't see the tiers between WR1 and WR10, then you're not looking at it correctly.  Yes, Jeffery is a value (he's currently end of the 2nd/beginning of the 3rd round), but the value of essentially getting two 1st round picks is far more than the savings of getting Jeffery at a 3-round discount."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:00 2015 UTC,10 team. .5 pt per carry/catch. Keep gronk for a 3rd or cj Anderson for a 7th.
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Kung_Fu_Master_Larry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:04:24 2015 UTC,Anderson. He's going to be picked in the 2nd this year and is headed for a big year in the new system.
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,reeljazz7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"Who would I rather have on my team? Gronk. We've seen how ridiculous his ceiling is and that, if healthy, he will be a monster.  But you can't just write off a third round pick. There's lots of talent to be had there. I'd probably take Anderson, even though I'm personally low on him.  Actually .5 per carry and reception? Yeah RBs are super valueable in your league. I'd take Anderson hands down."
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Kung_Fu_Master_Larry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:59 2015 UTC,Anderson.  He's the #1 RB in Denver and with Kubiak as the coach you should see a lot more running this year than in the past.

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,reeljazz7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:38 2015 UTC,Peterson/Brown makes an outstanding 1-2 punch.  Go with that.
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"10 man PPR - 1 keeper  •Le'Veon Bell - round 11  •Antonio Brown- round 6  •Rob Gronkowski- round 6  •Russell Wilson- round 13.   I am leaning towards Bell in the 11th as it seems like a no brainer. But my league was recently cut down from 2 keepers to 1 so since a lot more solid RBs and WRs will be on the board, thinking it may make sense to go with Gronk here.   Any input is greatly appreciated! Thanks"
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,grizzygreg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:29 2015 UTC,Your logic is sound. You KNOW Gronk will be one of if not the top TE with very few coming even close. There are a lot more guys who could be top RBs this year so you'll have good options in the draft.
fantasyfootball,3e24i3,dermaneek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Of the guys you listed, I'd rank them Bell, Gronkowski, Brown; in that order."

fantasyfootball,3e24i3,Caradin85,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:50 2015 UTC,I'd go Rogers. I really suspect a sophomore slump from ODB this year.
fantasyfootball,3e25ae,FFBot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:21 2015 UTC,"Due to unavoidable circumstances, our league is going to draft on August 1st. Normally we draft in late August; however, the early draft has brought about some issues for the league. Primarily, managers are concerned that valuable players that they drafted will be rendered useless by unforeseen injuries and the injuries will seriously damage their chances at winning. Does anyone have any solutions to this problem besides changing the draft date? One manger suggested that if a player develops a serious injury during the preseason that the owner could be reimbursed with FAAB (we have an auction draft so the thinking would be that if your $40 dollar player got injured you would get an extra $40 in FAAB). Has anyone used a system like this and if so was it successful?"
fantasyfootball,3e25ae,Ja0803,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"This is the primary reason my league drafts the weekend before the opening Thursday night game.  When we were forced to draft earlier, there was no compensation for drafting a player that got injured. You were forced to accept the injury and move forward.  It's just one of the risks you take.  I don't think that providing compensation is going to help you all that much.  You may get the cost of your player back, but most, if not all players that are worth anything are already off the table.  Good luck with a solution."
fantasyfootball,3e25ae,spazmeister,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:30:33 2015 UTC,"Are you rearranging your entire draft for one person? If so why?

If it's because of something medical or anything else serious then disregard."
fantasyfootball,3e2ugh,Mda1010,3,Tue Jul 21 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"Don't sleep on Carolina. They finished in the top ten last year despite all the midseason blowouts, they play the AFCS and they're in a soft division. I like their defense a lot this year."
fantasyfootball,3e2ugh,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:49 2015 UTC,"I'm into Carolina for the first few weeks, but I'm not sold on them for a year round start quite yet.  The NFCS was pretty shit last season which is rare for all the team in a single division to just never be able to fire on all cylinders. They all got better or have made adjustments to improve offense. Saints still have Brees, Falcons still have Ryan/Jones, and TB just picked up the top QB prospect and we saw what Mike Evans did with a shitty QB.  I'm fine with sitting on them all season, but plan on streaming a defense in for quite a few weeks."
fantasyfootball,3e2ugh,KoalaExpress,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:57 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel.  They start out with Jacksonville(!!!), Houston, New Orleans, Tampa Bay and I think I'm happy to start them in all 4, especially since week 3 against the Saints is in Carolina.  After that, though, they aren't playable for quite a stretch. They go week 5 bye, Seattle, Philly, Indy and Green Bay. That's 5 straight weeks, 5-9, that there is no way in hell I'm playing them.  They get playable for two more weeks after that (Tennessee and Washington) then go Cowboys and @Saints (not playable). Then we roll into fantasy playoffs and they have the Falcons sandwiched around the Giants. We won't know until midseason whether those will be good matchups or not.  I'm loving grabbing the Panthers for the first four weeks then likely just dropping them to stream then maybe pick them back up later on, matchup dependent."
fantasyfootball,3e2ugh,TooHappyFappy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:05 2015 UTC,Houston's gonna get a shitload of sacks and they have an easy schedule.  Cowboys are one of my sleepers too.
fantasyfootball,3e2ugh,Morall_tach,0,Tue Jul 21 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"I know this probably doesn't qualify as a very helpful response, but you can figure this out pretty quickly by looking at the top defenses' schedules.  They are the Seahawks, Rams, Dolphins, Bills, Texans, and Cardinals."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,DonMegah,31,Tue Jul 21 03:06:54 2015 UTC,Jordan Cameron has huge upside
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,HappyGilOHMYGOD,7,Tue Jul 21 03:12:37 2015 UTC,"But there's also a lot of mouths to feed there, it would be hard to count solely on Cameron."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Daviddem1234,6,Tue Jul 21 03:17:24 2015 UTC,Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are both better recievers than anyone starting on the Dolphins

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Daviddem1234,0,Tue Jul 21 08:29:49 2015 UTC,There's also a lot more to go around in Denver. Unless you see a huge shift in the offensive ranking for one of these two teams
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,str8_pants,2,Tue Jul 21 07:33:16 2015 UTC,Yup they'll definitely be running more with kubiak.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,swishnmiss41,3,Tue Jul 21 07:50:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say there are a lot of mouths to feed. Stills is mostly a big play guy and shouldn't get more than ~75 targets and Jennings is mostly washed up. Unless Parker comes in and makes and is an instant success, Cameron should get plenty of looks in that offense. I could see him being second in targets after Landry. Its a league average receiving core, maybe slightly better."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,humanhighlightreel,3,Tue Jul 21 13:25:41 2015 UTC,"as long as parker stays healthy (LONG shot), I think he'll be a monster. he has massive size, and he's a great route runner. his biggest strength is yac, and miami runs a quick throw scheme. lots of slants, ins, button hooks.   MONSTER"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,andrewsaccount,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"I love Parker too, but the guy is probably going to miss all or most of training camp. While it didn't matter for Odell, that makes the NFL adjustment a lot harder. I think Parker could be MASSIVE by next year, but it will take him time to get going, especially since there are decent, experienced receivers ahead of him."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:06 2015 UTC,Could be a guy you draft knowing he might be a 2nd half of the season receiver. Stash him after you have a few solid WR replacements on your bench.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,humanhighlightreel,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:27 2015 UTC,Definitely. I'm just saying don't avoid Cameron because of him.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Daviddem1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"A normal team has 2 maybe 3 capable receivers. They have five, I believe Landry will lead In receptions, Cameron in td's if he stays healthy, then everyone will be getting around the same from there on."

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,DarylHinkovich,2,Tue Jul 21 16:57:04 2015 UTC,"He always has had upside, but he had major concussion issues last season. If he gets another this season, they will likely shut him down. I don't think his ADP is late enough to justify a draft pick unless he really falls.  If you are willing to take a risk, draft him and then a Rudolph/Walker/Eifert in the later rounds. Just know you are sacrificing depth at other, perhaps more important positions"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,cowmandude,0,Tue Jul 21 14:39:54 2015 UTC,Do you worry that his yardage will suffer since he's on a team with a solid slot receiver?
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Mr_Cartmenez,14,Tue Jul 21 15:03:29 2015 UTC,Delanie Walker was a top ten TE last year so he's my go to late TE.

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,romisbmw1989,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, they have Kendall wright and Hakeem Nicks and a buch of unproven pass catchers. Delanie could easily be the #2 target in that offense."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Aceoangels,2,Tue Jul 21 17:45:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People are sleeping on this guy. He had a great year last year, with a shitty QB. Now with Marcus in play, he should be better than his ADP"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Aceoangels,17,Tue Jul 21 17:38:16 2015 UTC,Eifert!
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,itsJimboFresh,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:48 2015 UTC,Tell me more about Eifert? From the little I've heard sounds like he could be a nice sleeper option.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Aceoangels,17,Tue Jul 21 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"3 targets and 3 catches in the half game he played before he was hurt. No more Gresham in Cinci and Dalton is capable of good fantasy production. He's a beast and everyone can't stop raving about him in camp. I've drafted him in the last round in almost every mock (which allows me to draft a better DST as well!) and injury aside, he should end up a top 10 TE"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,BlindWillieJohnson,5,Tue Jul 21 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"downside to eifert:  Two great backs that also get involved on passing game and target monster AJ Green not to mention Sanu and possible comeback sleeper slot WR marvin jones.  Essentially, I could see a 5 for 70 yd and TD game with his opportunity, but not many with all those offensive weapons in cincy"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,GoingAllTheJay,3,Tue Jul 21 05:32:51 2015 UTC,There's downside to everyone not named Gronk. For me if I'm waiting for a TE it's between Rudolph and Eifert. The Vikes also have a lot of mouths to feed but I think you can say that about 20+ teams.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,itsJimboFresh,2,Tue Jul 21 12:16:37 2015 UTC,"Marvin Jones was on fucking fire when he got hurt in 2013. His last injury was a broken foot, if I recall, so he should be totally healed from it. keep on eye on him in camp.  My biggest problem with every Bengals pass catchter no named AJ green is that Dalton is just too inconsistent to rely on week to week. They're also learning that as a team, and moving steadily to a very run heavy approach. Great if you have Gio and Hill handcuffed. Bad if you have anyone but AJ. Lots of mouths, few opportunities."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,Canadaismyhat,2,Tue Jul 21 06:21:29 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with every Bengals pass catchter no named AJ green is that Dalton is just too inconsistent to rely on week to week.

AJ Green and Marvin are both healthy and will get a good amount of the target share.   Pros: A QB like Dalton needs a TE safety valve to survive in the NFL. Some QBs need their TEs, some don't. Eifert will be the chain mover and arguably the most important possession receiver on the team.  Bottom line: He doesn't have opportunity for enough volume to have an 80+ catch superstar breakout, but he's an integral part of their offense. Expect 50-62 balls for 550-700 yards."

Remember 2008 Lions 0-16 season? Calvin Johnson was a top 15 receiver that year, for fantasy points overall. If a player is good, he's good. That's just how I see it, at least. You draft the player, not the team. I guess it doesn't hurt to have a good team around the player though, you're right!"

Look at some of the higher scoring teams lately like the Pats and Saints and Packers and Colts and Broncos and Falcons. Those teams all support multiple fantasy-relevant RBs, receivers, TEs, and QBs because there are so many points to go around. Teams that don't score a lot of points (like the Rams, Jags, Titans, Bills) can't feed multiple fantasy guys because they just don't score much."

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,BisonST,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"That's true, but without the TDs those guys tend to settle at the bottom of TE1 range. I want a chance at a top 5 TE, and that comes from a lot of TDs.  There's a lot of hype around Kelce and Ertz again this year, but neither did much last year so I need to see it before I believe it. Martellus is in a new offense with a changing receiving corps. To me, Walker is probably the most appealing of those guys, but there's a lot of new blood in that offense. I just think Allen has a better chance to be a top 5 TE than the guys you mentioned, but he also has a better chance to be worthless."

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,onesonesones,8,Tue Jul 21 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"Nah. He had a similar situation last year and is most likely splitting carries with Virgil Green. They aren't going to treat Daniels the same way as Julius, they're very different players and Thomas was much better. I'd rather wait on TE and pick a Walker, a Green/Gates combo, or even Eric Ebron, who has a shot at showing up to his potential, however doubtful."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,MountOlympus97,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"wait on a TE and pick Walker, Green/Gates combo.   Both Walker and Gates go before Daniels in fantasy pros consensus rankings...  And doesnt Daniels have a long history with the new HC?  Cecil Lammey, who covers the Broncos, said Daniels is gonna be the guy on the most recent Audible podcast for whatever that's worth.   Definitely not gonna be JT, but isn't solid production possible?"
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,MountOlympus97,3,Tue Jul 21 04:48:40 2015 UTC,"In the 12 man standard drafts i've done over at fantasyfootballcalculator he's consistently gone between the 7th and the 8th, near ertz and cameron. Walker has shown to go around the 9th, and Green has dropped enormously since his 4 game suspension, an ADP which i expect to recover partially as we get closer to the season.   Over the past 5 seasons Daniels has averaged 528 yards and about 4 TDs. Yardage wise last year he finished as the 16th TE. His age doesn't help things, and despite being with kubiak again this year, keep in mind that he was with him last year in Baltimore, where he put up 527/4.   In contrast, JT was able to score 12 touchdowns the last two years with over 500 yards each time. Daniels is an aging player who shows minimal upside in the role that he's currently in, and given how different JT is to Daniels i think it's fair to assume that the 32 year old Bronco TE wont be coming close to those numbers.   I would expect him to be used the same as kubiak did last year, which would be end up being somewhere around the 600/3 mark.   Cecil's right in that Owen is the TE1 right now in Denver- Green will play more as a blocker and Daniels should get the lion's share of carries - but you shouldn't expect much production out of him save for one or two above average games. I definitely wouldn't want to rely on him as my TE1 unless I had to."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,joobtastic,2,Tue Jul 21 05:15:37 2015 UTC,JT scored those 12 TDs because of Peyton fucking Manning.  Bortles isn't going to be throwing to JT that much.

fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,HOLIDAY_headcase,0,Tue Jul 21 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"Over the past 5 seasons Daniels has averaged 528 yards and about 4 TDs In contrast, JT was able to score 12 touchdowns the last two years with over 500 yards each time.    You can't compare Daniels with Flacco/Schaub to JT with Peyton Manning. There are going to be extra TDs in Denver and Daniels is going to get plenty of chances.   I think you're underestimating Daniel's ability and the Manning effect.   Also, TE's don't get ""carries""."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,bullsfan4life,0,Tue Jul 21 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"You can compare the coaching staff though. Kubiak has used Daniels the same way for the bulk of his career - save for a few more red zone looks I think he puts up numbers that are at best slightly better than last season. The reorientation to a balanced offense in this past offseason means more balance, so I do expect Peyton to fall a bit short of last season purely based on the scheme. There's always a possibility that he goes crazy though, which is something to keep in mind.  I think you're underestimating the athletic and skill gaps between Thomas and Daniels. Daniels has never been a stud in any offense he's been a part of and it's not like there hasn't been opportunity. He's shown what he can do. Schaub put up 3 4000+ yard seasons while Daniels was there and at his best he was able to be a middling TE, topping out as the 8th best TE in 2012. He had plenty of chances, he just was mediocre. While Thomas's stats are a in part a product of being around Peyton Manning at his best, he's still a younger, more athletic, and larger TE than Daniels.   To assume that Daniels is going to get the same amount of looks as Thomas is like believing that Josh Hill will get all of Jimmy Graham's targets now that he's gone - which won't happen as they'll be redistributed throughout the offense given the decrease in talent.   Feel free to take him, but with his track record I'll be passing."
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,CptBurbagio,0,Tue Jul 21 16:42:38 2015 UTC,I'm not concerned with yards from Daniels. I think 500 - 700 is his likely range. I do think he's in a good position to put up 8-10 TDs this year. Top 10 seems plausible to me.
fantasyfootball,3e0zx1,SeanJuan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"Can't say I think VG will get many reps, seems like he's always gotten a significantly small amount of work, as a 5th year.

At that point you're just taking a shot in the dark with Owen Daniels if you draft him as your TE1, and with everyone else who has shown consistency and usage is gone like I mentioned, you have Gates riding it out for 4 games - which who knows, it could get reduced - then you have a big TE1 in a wayyyyy better offense from last year and maybe you already hit a HR with Owen Daniels.

Honestly, I don't think I would. Going on his fourth season, he has yet to show me a tremendous amount of talent. Opportunity hasn't exactly been there because Gates' has been mostly healthy, but I'm not exactly sold that Ladarius does anything crazy in those 4 games to cement his name in fantasy. Rivers is going to throw to a guy he knows really well and that's Keenan Allen and Malcolm Floyd, then Stevie Johnson in the slot. Melvin Gordon will even get check downs and bubble screens as a rookie. I can see Ladarius blocking a lot more than being used a primary receiving TE - think Dwayne Allen, the TD dependent monster of a TE. And I don't want to have 3 TE's on my team. I did it last year as I drafted Jordan Reed, had Niles Paul backing him up, and I had traded for VD before he was hurt and terrible.  This is my mentality on the situation:  I wrote this really late at night but basically what I meant to say was that if I don't get a top 5 TE, so: Gronk, JG, Olsen, Kelce, Bennett, then I will target Gates who will surely be a steal at his ADP because of his suspension of 4 games and I also really like Owen Daniels later on as well.

With 3 good RBs and getting that Center from Seattle for Graham the Saints are going to look to slow down the game.

Now, even if the Saints go to committee at TE, I think it is safe to say that Hill will still get the Red Zone looks. With that said however, Brees will in all likelihood continue to do what he has always done in NO, and spread the ball all over. So this is basically a long way of saying no, I would not start the hype train. Hill is most likely going to be like majority of TE's in the game these days, and be a TD reliant player. If you end up drafting him, there will certainly be games where you will be satisfied, but on games where he doesn't get a TD, he is not going to save face with 100 yds receiving. He is certainly worth keeping an eye on,perhaps as a fill in for your TE1 on a bye week, or in case his TDs become very consistent."

fantasyfootball,3e1o59,shitty_username,4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:10 2015 UTC,"Probably Gronk, honestly. He gives you such an advantage at the TE position that if you already have the rights to a top RB, you have a huge leg up on the competition. I would take him as early as five overall. Is it a reach? Maybe. But I guarantee he doesn't make it past No. 12 in a lot of leagues and if you're sitting at 5 in a 12 team league, he's just not falling to you in the second round. The obvious answer is to go with another RB in the first, but Gronk is the definition of high risk, high reward (health being the major risk). He'll get all the prime looks from Brady in a season which the Pats will be fired up from all the deflategate nonsense."
fantasyfootball,3e1o59,jlo47,2,Tue Jul 21 07:21:43 2015 UTC,Can't stress enough how fired up Brady is. I'm talking 2007 all over again with spygate....minus the Super Bowl loss.
fantasyfootball,3e1o59,iHeartAtmosphere,2,Tue Jul 21 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on your scoring settings.    In general, I would look to double up with another top RB or maybe snag Gronk."
fantasyfootball,3e1o59,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:50:03 2015 UTC,"I would go after a really strong Receiver or Gronk.  Once you've got a great RB you can lean on them pretty well and then roll the dice on an upcoming (or waiver wire pickup) RB.  Depends on your scoring, player setup, etc naturally.  I had Lynch and Dez Bryant last year though, that tandem helped me win a championship!"

I think Gronk or a premier WR would fit better though as that will make a better foundation for a team."
fantasyfootball,3e1o59,holyplankton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:51 2015 UTC,Take another RB. If your team has 2 stud RB's you will dominate.

I'm high on these guys anyway, but if you have RB1 locked up that's even more incentive. I like to build a balanced team so there are more ways to improve the team throughout the season. If you have two elite RB's, then your late-round RB sleepers and RB WW pickups become less valuable."

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,jdblad,29,Tue Jul 21 00:30:48 2015 UTC,I would take him at his current ADP. His numbers when healthy were very helpful for my team. He has great hands for a RB and is so shifty with burning speed. I really think his play relies on Palmer though.

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,ApparentlyABear,5,Tue Jul 21 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"Decent option in PPR, but has very limited upside. Arians has said multiple times that he will cut back on Ellingtons workload in order to keep him fresh. Ellington just doesn't have the body to be a feature back. In my eyes hes more of a change of pace guy that u platoon with a power back. Look at ellingtons YPC last year, it was terrible. Plus, when u have to play 6 division games against some tough run Ds, I think it will be hard to count on ellington for solid production. I really dont know who will be the true lead back here because when i look at the personel there in AZ its tough to say. i think someone will emerge during preseason though. Assuming someone in that backfield emerges as the power back, I probably wont be drafting ellington (maybe in PPR), i prefer someone like Spiller or Blount or even Tre Mason."
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,odellbeckham13,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was able to get him for $25 in our auction as my RB2 with J.Charles as RB1, and I had Ellington last year and he had some quality games but was mostly off. I grabbed the rookie Johnson late in the draft but not sure if I should even hold on to Johnson. Plenty of time till the season to figure it out, just wanted an idea of what folks thought of Ellington this year since posts about him are few and in between compared to last year. Thanks"

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,TheVetNoob,2,Tue Jul 21 18:02:21 2015 UTC,I'll wait to see him in an NFL game before I declare him the best back on the roster.
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,cjmcclain,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:09 2015 UTC,Anyone have any input on his dynasty value? Currently have him on a team so I'm hopeful but sadly its a standard IDP format league so his value takes a little bit of a hit.
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,Nopqrs,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,admittedly I've never done a dynasty so I don't really know the intricacies and all involved.  That being said I would keep him.  All we've seen is a rookie year under a new head coach where he was great followed by a year that was going quite well even with injuries and a cycle of 3 quarterbacks... I would take the risk of having him on my team for another year just to see. I'd rather have him on my team and watch him fail than go to another team an stay a strong reliable RB.
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,peckx063,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:44 2015 UTC,David Johnson is a bit of a duplication of skill set and most think he's probably the better asset. It's really hard to trust Ellington's health.
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,cjmcclain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:16:09 2015 UTC,I figured. Missed out in my dynasty draft on drafting Johnson but I'm hoping that doesn't bite me this season.

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,fytfootball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan. Avoided him in previous years. But in doing mocks this year I seem to keep drafting him as my 3rd/4th RB. He's a great value at his current ADP.  I think David Johnson looks just ok, but nobody pays me to scout college players. If I draft Ellington as my RB3 I feel like I have to draft Johnson and hold him all year. If I can get Ellington as my RB4, maybe he's worth a flier without the ""handcuff"". I'm not sure Johnson will get very many carries, at least at the start of the year, but Ellington is still paper and if he goes down I want to have Johnson at the ready."
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,itzcindy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:22:32 2015 UTC,"Avoided him in previous years   He's only been in the league for two years, and draft relevant for one.

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,fytfootball,0,Tue Jul 21 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"His 2013 and 2014 stats were almost identical. I'm sorry you don't pay attention to rookies. Some people play dynasty leagues, you know."
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,zhr_robert,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"he heavily depends on his OLINE for yardage with one of the worst yards after contact per attempt in the league last year.  that said, his offensive line is projected by PFF to be 20 ranks better at run blocking this year.  also he is an injury risk."
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,DarylHinkovich,2,Tue Jul 21 12:02:07 2015 UTC,"The issue is not a lack of talent or opportunity, but rather his lack of size (at a punishing position like running back) and perhaps too much opportunity (he was fed the ball at a high volume as the workhorse back) will lead to continued injury issues: http://sportsinjurypredictor.com/injury-predictor/player/26810.   Unfortunately, the Cardinals made no effort to acquire a more durable back to lighten Ellington's carries total. If Ellington continues to be fed the ball at such a high volume, the likelihood of injury goes up tremendously, especially for a more fragile player like him.  It is a nice luxury to have him as your number 3/4 running back and start him the weeks he manages to stay healthy at flex, but considering how ugly the WR position gets in the later rounds of drafts (the Decker tier), it's probably best to target WRs near Ellington's ADP and take risks on the rookie RBs in the proceeding rounds."
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,Simpleminded269,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:11 2015 UTC,I don't want anyone going against Seattle or St. Louis' defense twice a year
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,SuperFamousGuy,6,Tue Jul 21 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"If he falls to my rb3/4 spot I take him every time. I wouldn't worry much about the rookie they drafted. Some are saying they've lost faith in Ellington, I just think the rookie is their contingency plan.   He may lose some TDs to Dwyer, but he didn't score many TDs last year anyway. Plus he's healthy now and so is Palmer so he should have a lot more to offer in the passing game.   All in all I like him this year. Think he'll have a resurgence, but he won't be amazing. I wouldn't reach for him, but I'll take him in the 6th round every time. Would consider him strongly in the 5th."

Just gotta be careful how much bench you take up with handcuffs, those spots could be used on hot waiver wire pick ups or better draft picks"
fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,AllDaveAllDay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:39 2015 UTC,"I think he might have standalone value, so if you want him as a handcuff you might have to draft him higher than you would normally draft a handcuff."

fantasyfootball,3e0gyc,thebig54,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:28 2015 UTC,"Everything I've read on blogs and rotoworld says that Johnson, at least this year, is there primarily to spell Ellington and give the cardinals a contingency plan. The coaching staff drafted Johnson because he can come in and do the same things as Ellington if he gets injured. I think next year or after that Johnson will be a bigger threat, but I think this year the job is still Ellington's to lose. When he was healthy last year, and when Palmer was healthy, Ellington was a dynamic playmaker. The cards improved their o-line, Ellington has a fully healed foot, and Palmer is fully healthy. I'm all in on Ellington in the 4th-5th round"

As long as johnsons adp stays low he's worth picking up along with Ellington. I don't see their backfield turning into much of a platoon.  Whether Ellington can't stay healthy or gets beat outright, I believe you're locking up a starter who will get 15-20 touches a game by drafting both."

Apparently Johnson is a bit bigger and faster, and is a legitimate candidate to steal some carries from Ellington. I think that if Ellington has a solid preseason and Palmer stays healthy, then we can gauge whether or not Johnson will be a factor and draft Ellington safely. A lot of his success does hinge on Palmer being healthy and an ACL tear + falling defensive linemen and linebackers coming at your knees is a scary thought."

fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,BlindWillieJohnson,5,Tue Jul 21 04:41:19 2015 UTC,"That's an insane amount of yardage to award a PR. I would talk to your commissioner about that. Under that rule, Patterson was one of the top receivers in 2013."
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,GOTaSMALL1,5,Tue Jul 21 01:28:51 2015 UTC,You missed the . i think! It's .1! Sorry if that was unclear!
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,BlindWillieJohnson,7,Tue Jul 21 01:38:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's a lot. My wife's work league is like that. This will be the third year she is drafting in that league, and I still don't think people realize how absolutely essential return yards are to the win. Drafted Patterson in 2013 when nobody was looking at him. Took Hester and Landry last year and people thought she was nuts."
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,sfhood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:49:08 2015 UTC,Yeah Hester was WR21 last year haha
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,darkeagle91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:33 2015 UTC,.1 pt for yard is the normal receiving yard isn't it? 1 point for 10 yards? I don't think PR yardage should be valued equally to receiving/rushing yardage.
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,Delduca,4,Tue Jul 21 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Same as Rec or Rush yds. I like it, adds another layer. Since it's PPR as well, Edelman is top 18 and Brown was #1 by about 60 points last year. CPatt still a non factor, wr43."
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,Ferg8,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"My main league values receiving yards at .05. I have no problem with valuing them, but not that much. Especially since a lot of returners basically get 10 free yards on a return before anyone's there to stop them. I think it's way too high, but that's just my opinion."
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,Ferg8,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:40 2015 UTC,Well that's why i'm compiling a list!
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,pagelzz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:52:13 2015 UTC,Came to say this... But whatever the league wants. Are you guys doing KR yardage too? A decent returner on a bad defense can get 10-15 points a game easy.
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,IronV2,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:14 2015 UTC,"With the way we do it, it's a little less intense. We don't count the first 15 return yards, and then anything after that is .05. It gives a little push to some guys, but it doesn't turn trash heap receivers into superstars.   We thought about doing it the way OP's league did, but when we saw some of the guys who would have been studs, we changed our minds. Did you know that with that kind or return yardage, Tyler Thigpen would have been a top ten back in 2013?"
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,TURRRDS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"We also award 1 point for every 10 return yards but our league is 16-team with full IDP so we are looking for other ways for players to score. With large rosters, the really talented players are gone early. This keeps it competitive. It also adds a level of excitement."
fantasyfootball,3e0dfa,toad_mountain,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Dwayne Harris will be the Giants return guy (Definitely not Demps), and he'll be a stud.  He was brought in this offseason at ~3.5mil/yr for the next 5 years specifically for that role."

fantasyfootball,3e24ly,CorsoKO,2,Tue Jul 21 14:45:28 2015 UTC,Ehh idk. Who's on your waiver wire? Don't forget Tom is suspended for 4 games...

fantasyfootball,3e24ly,BobJones4980,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:21 2015 UTC,As did I with Gordon lol. But I feel like this is a calculated risk. My 4th and 6th WR and a RB I was gonna cut for an above average QB. Was likely gonna grab Palmer anyway so id just do the same with a great option after the suspension. Hopefully it works out but hey worth a risk every now and again. Also any opinions on  Blount vs Rashad Jennings? I got 4 solid RBs now so the Blount suspension isn't a concern.

Adam Vinatieri Travis Kelce Jay Cutler Packers D/ST Carlos Hyde Kelvin Benjamin Jeremy Hill Cardinals D/ST Keenan Allen Tre Mason Kyle Orton    For reference, my current keeper list is Lacy, Gronk, Watkins, Edelman, Roethlisberger. I can trade him picks too."
fantasyfootball,3e24ly,Matthouse3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"I would rather have Benjamin, Hill, and/or Kelce than Watkins, Edelman or Ruthlessboner."
fantasyfootball,3e24ly,niclake13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:58 2015 UTC,Any of those guys in that list would replace Ben in that keeper slot. My keeper list is stretched out over the whole draft right now.
fantasyfootball,3e24ly,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"In general, I would never keep a middling QB like Ben.  So that immediately opens up one spot for you to attempt to trade for.    Edelman has an ADP of 52, which would be middle of the 5th round, so I wouldn't want to keep him as my #4 keeper.  Benjamin and Hyde are both slotted right at the end of the 3rd round right now (12-team league), so either one would be a significant improvement for you."
fantasyfootball,3e24ly,niclake13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:29 2015 UTC,"Our keepers work weird, and I'd be keeping Edelman in the 8th round. Ben in the 16th (any FA we pick up gets dumped into the 16 slot). But, all those guys I listed off are 16s as well, so having an upgrade over Ben would be preferable. Then I just have to target a QB in the draft."
fantasyfootball,3e24ly,FredFlanders,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit torn on this one.  I know I'm giving up the best player, but I also think his value is going to continue to drop going forward. I think this one is close and I could use some other opinions either way.  Obviously, I can stand pat and just enjoy his production for the next 2-5 years, but this is also an opportunity to improve my roster for the future.  Dynasty league:  I give Calvin Johnson  I get Devin Funchess, Christine Michael, 2016 1st round pick, 2017 3rd round pick."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,AwSnapz1,15,Mon Jul 20 22:07:57 2015 UTC,I think AJ has some juice left in the tank and a chip on his shoulder.   I'd pick him up just for his Texans matchups.

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,oshidoman,21,Tue Jul 21 14:56:12 2015 UTC,"He shouldnt be higher than Evans, imo"
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,RealMikeTrout27,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:01 2015 UTC,"He's only saying he very well could be. Yes, Evans' ceiling is definitely higher than AJ's as he has plenty of ferocity and explosiveness to the high point of the catch, but the odds of his production being greater than AJ's ceiling may be negligible, just the thin end of the bell. Ceiling edge: Evans.  Then you compare non-injury-related floors, and immediately the edge has to go to the duo with 15 years experience over their counterpart with 1, total.  And if you want to make the old argument that younger means less injury prone, rotoworld's new partner debunked that. Not to mention the comparables of their offenses, floor edge goes to Andre Johnson.  The above is an argument for a risk-averse drafter. And how much risk you're willing to take may depend on your first couple picks. I can see why people would lean AJ for the price. At Evans' ADP, I'd rather take almost any of the RB tier consisting of Forsett, Morris, Gore, Gordon, Miller & Ingram and hope to get AJ the next round."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,1zee,3,Mon Jul 20 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Johnson does not have a higher floor than Evans. He is getting up there in age, and could fall off any minute. If he slips behind Moncrief on the depth chart (real possibility), he will be borderline fantasy irrelevant. Mike Evans is the number one option on his team, and that will not change, because he is the best offensive player on his team.   If you are taking Johnson, who doesn't have much big play ability left, you are also betting on him scoring a lot of TDs because he is not going back to 180 targets per year. Scoring is something he has never done a lot of - even when he was racking up 1.5k yards per year he wasn't hitting double digit TDs. I think he can do that, but it is a gamble and TDs are somewhat flukey anyway.  At the end of the day, look at these players and ask: who has a better chance of being on my bench most weeks. That player has the lower floor, and that player is the 34 year old guy who was on benches last year."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,humanhighlightreel,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:36 2015 UTC,"He is getting up there in age, and could fall off any minute   This is based purely in speculation, not fact, as proved by my source.   Look at the guys on the same career production list as Andre Johnson, see what they did at 34, and get back to me.  The reality is, neither guy will be on your bench for many weeks unless your lotto picks or waiver snags pay off. The reason AJ was on benches last year was QB play. Houston averaged nearly 100 ypg and 10 points in passer rating less than Indy."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,1zee,0,Tue Jul 21 14:54:18 2015 UTC,"Your source proves that older players aren't more injury prone, not that they don't fall off performance-wise.   And lots of guys near Johnson in career yards fell off at or before 34. Randy Moss, Tory Holt, Steve Largent, Andre Reed, Michael Irvin, Hines Ward, Larry Fitz.   And Johnson has already started to decline."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"Mentioning guys that didn't play at 34 says nothing about what Andre Johnson will do at 34.    These guys are below Andre Johnson on the career receiving list:   Torry Holt & Michael Irvin did not play at 34. Fitz isn't 34 yet. Apples and oranges. The fact that AJ's production has stayed above these guys for a longer time means he is on a whole different level. Steve Largent never caught 80 balls. AJ caught 85 at age 33. Andre Reed caught 85 balls only twice in his 16 year career. Andre Johnson has caught 85 balls 7 of his last 9 seasons. Hines Ward is the only decent argument, but he still caught 5 TDs in 15 games at 34 in an offense with Mike Wallace, Antwaan Randle El, Antonio Brown, Rashard Mendenhall, Emmanuel Sanders, Heath Miller, Mewelde Moore, Matt Spaeth, & Isaac Redman in a season where Big Ben only played 3/4 of the season.   A better comparison would be to look at the guys in the same realm as AJ, as everyone you mentioned besides Moss is worse.  Here are 3: Cris Carter, Marvin Harrison, and Reggie Wayne. Hey look, they all played at age 34! Their production? See below:   Carter: 90/1,241/13 Harrison: 95/1,366/12 Wayne: 106/1,355/5 - it's worth noting that he seemed to have a dip in production in his age 33 season, just like AJ, catching just 75/960/4."

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"If someone didn't play at 34 or is 31 and already dropped off, its because they dropped off before 34. Not sure what your argument was there.   All those guys I listed are comparable to or better than Johnson. They might be slightly behind on the All-time yardage list, but AJ has never caught as many TDs as the others.   People tend to retire shortly after they fall off, so cherry picking the guys that were still around and dismissing the guys who weren't is just a dumb way to look at things. Cherry picking stats is how ppl fuck themselves over in fantasy."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,1zee,0,Tue Jul 21 21:36:35 2015 UTC,"It's not cherry picking when you're comparing apples and oranges.  A WR that couldn't make it past 31 has absolutely no bearing on a WR that had 194 receptions at 32 and 33.  The former is just inferior.    In fact, every single one of the WRs you mentioned except Moss is inferior.  Your TD argument crumples as it's cherry picked itself (if my stats are) and fails to take into account the ineptitude of his QB and offense as a whole for a majority of his career."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,humanhighlightreel,0,Tue Jul 21 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"It's not cherry picking when you're comparing apples and oranges. A WR that couldn't make it past 31 has absolutely no bearing on a WR that had 194 receptions at 32 and 33. The former is just inferior.   The point is that WRs decline at different times. A lot of the guys you mentioned as not playing were still very good at 31, 32, but done by 34. Yes, some guys are good to 38, but given that he has already showed signs of decline and how fast that comes, there is no reason to expect that to be AJ.    In fact, every single one of the WRs you mentioned except Moss is inferior. Your TD argument crumples as it's cherry picked itself (if my stats are) and fails to take into account the ineptitude of his QB and offense as a whole for a majority of his career.   This is just simply not true. There are different types of receivers who excel in different areas. Larry Fitzgerald is absolutely a better career receiver than AJ. He isn't as good of a possession receiver, but his dominance in the red zone more than makes up for the difference.   Same goes for Steve Largent - no, he never caught 85 balls and he didn't play as long, but he had way more big play ability than Johnson - scoring more by catching deep balls better than any player not named Randy.   It is also worth noting that he played in an era when teams passed a lot less (5 fewer passes per game per team in 1985 to last year).   Michael Irvin was definitely as good better than Johnson in his prime, though he didn't last as long, and is actually a pretty good comp.   Tory Holt and Andre Reed are worse than him (played with much better QBs), but we are still talking about the same tier of player."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,1zee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"A lot of the guys you mentioned as not playing were still very good at 31, 32, but done by 34.   Simply, no.  The only people I mentioned averaged 97/1320/10 when they were precisely 34.     He has already showed signs of decline   Every player, every season, there is variability.  He had a below average year, sure.  But catching 85 balls is not a sign of the end.  See Wayne's 75 catch, age 33 season.   Yes, some guys are good to 38... there is no reason to expect that to be AJ.   Actually, there is every reason to expect that.  The guys that stayed good to 38 are the only guys that produced at AJ's level and age.   Yes, different receivers excel in different areas.  There is no denying AJ's greatest strength is route running as a possession receiver.  By definition, possession receivers have a higher floor than big play guys.  Anyways, you said yourself that TDs are flukey.   But it's not like AJ was inept in the end zone.  He was the only guy worth covering with 2 defenders for most of his time in Houston, and he still caught 27% of their passing TDs.  That would equate to 11 TDs in Andrew Luck's 2014 Colt offense."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,barrdown,9,Tue Jul 21 16:56:54 2015 UTC,He had a ridiculous amount of targets in Houston (more than DeAndre Hopkins) I can't see him getting the same number of look in the Colts offence... I'm just not sure what to expect from him this season... For that reason i doubt I'll take a chance on him
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Celliott89,12,Tue Jul 21 17:15:44 2015 UTC,I disagree about the lack of targets.  Johnson will effectively be filling the role Reggie Wayne played and Wayne had 116 targets last year. Plus Luck will easily be the best passer he has had a chance to work with.  I can easily see Johnson getting those targets and being a productive receiver catching at least 70-75 balls for ~900-1000 yards and 5-6 tds.
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,fubuvsfitch,8,Mon Jul 20 22:35:31 2015 UTC,"He'll have more TDs than that. Luck will use him effectively in the red zone, something the Texans never did.  I think he had maybe three fades thrown his way in his decade in Houston.  I think he goes for 12-15 TDs this year. He is driven. He has the best QB he's ever had. The colts offense is going to be better and their defense worse. I really wouldn't be surprised to see records set by Indy this year."

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,2600forlife,3,Tue Jul 21 05:40:51 2015 UTC,"Return of Mathis, Newsome looking better at the end of the season last year, Werner was playing a lot better before he got injured last season (and don't overlook the potential of Adongo at OLB if Werner fails). The addition of Langford helps. And reports have been good about rookie Clayton Geathers at FS, and the Colts have also been talking up practice squad safety Winston Guy.   At any rate, they didn't lose anyone very important (with the possible exception of Cory Redding), and there are a lot of promising prospects. So, while they may not be the next incarnation of the Seattle defense, I don't see any reason to believe they'll be worse, and I think they should be better."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,fubuvsfitch,2,Tue Jul 21 06:05:25 2015 UTC,"We'll see what that young secondary can do.  Redding hurts pretty bad imo.

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Celliott89,2,Tue Jul 21 06:22:50 2015 UTC,The loss of Redding is HUGE. He was effectively the leader of the defense.

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,fubuvsfitch,4,Tue Jul 21 05:14:35 2015 UTC,He's a once in a lifetime talent. I don't think people outside of Houston fully understand just how hamstrung he has been here by not only poor qb play but also poor play calling and generally poor usage. Sure he got a bunch of targets but they weren't the kind of targets that maximized his talent.  He may not have it in him for as long as Rice did but he's got it for this year at least.  I'm overly optimistic maybe but hey I'm allowed to be irrational sometimes!
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,IronV2,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:27 2015 UTC,He's a once in a lifetime talent   Randy Moss  Calvin Johnson  Try again pal

I stand by my statement, buddy."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,IronV2,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"Once in a life time means he's the only one with his talent level, talentwise he's decidedly below those two. Terrell Owens too for the record"

Edit: Since I have received no response regarding your opinion on who is a once in a lifetime receiver by your vague yet somehow stringent standards, I'll provide a list of NFL record currently held by Johnson:  Only player with 60+ receptions in his first 8 seasons  Most games with 10+ receptions in a season: 7 (tied with Wes Welker)  Most seasons with 100+ receptions: 5 (tied with Wes Welker)  Most seasons with 100+ receptions and 1,400+ yards : 4  Most games with 10+ receptions"

Ultimately,  I agree that Johnson should be going behind the names the OP listed but I am optimistic for him this year. I'd rather have him as a WR3."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,NannigarCire,5,Tue Jul 21 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"I'm high on Andre. Really high on him. Andre's had a ton of amazing seasons playing under the less pass intensive Houston Texans where his scoring potential was limited. With Luck, he's got a passer that has nearly no limitations, an offense around him that forces coverage to spread out, and insane scoring potential on the weekly.  I'm definitely taking him over Hopkins, the situation and scoring potential is much higher for AJ. I'm definitely taking him for Benjamin, because Benjamin is straight up a terrible football player who was way propped up by playing in a situation where only two players existed on offense (himself and Olsen, entire run game was injured, including Cam + no WRs). I'm definitely taking him over Cooks, who's now switching to a run centric offense and doesn't have the production basis for being drafted in the round he's drafted in. Im definitely taking him over Evans, who only had a 3 game span of dominance against 3 of the worst pass defenses in the NFL, now switching to a rookie QB and having to deal with the ups and downs of that season (i'm not even certain Winston's going to prefer throwing to Evans since he's a very timing oriented passer and Jackson would fit him a lot better than Evans in that sense). Matthews is the only guy who i'd have to go back and forth on between him and AJ because he has the same scoring and redzone potential. On my fantasypros list, i *basically have Matthews and Andre right next to each other."

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,NannigarCire,2,Tue Jul 21 03:35:44 2015 UTC,"Poor route running, poor hands, doesn't understand how to use his body to box out players. His college tape is still one of the worst i've ever seen. The drafting of Funchess is insurance incase of Benjamin's failure to develop, and his situation has changed because an additional target will make them lean less on him to begin with, and it'll magnify his issues when theres other targets on the field who don't have those issues, and last year every single RB they had was injured, and the return of Stewart at full health (for however long that is) means much less use of Benjamin if he's still the same player."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,bencalpink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:14 2015 UTC,"You prompted me to look at his dropped passes, 2nd most in the league last year wow. I wasn't buying that Funchess will eat in to too much production of a rookie that put up 1,000 and 9 (and certainly not JStew) but I'm lower on Benjamin than I have been for a while now. Good points."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:47 2015 UTC,"The last time Stewart was actually healthy for a year, Cam targeted him 61 times back in his rookie year. Don't be surprised if he's peppered again if Stewart remains healthy."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,moonftball12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you like Andre Johnson more than the younger guys who are more athletic and in way better situations. I'm also VERY high on Andre Johnson this year, but he's still competing against TY Hilton and rookie Phillip Dorsett, who was a first round pick and is going to be starting in that offense, and talk was that Moncrief will barely make the 4th WR on the field. I think AJ will definitely get HIS but Luck is going to spread the ball around to a lot of guys, even Dwayne Allen and Coby Fleener will take targets, too.  I don't agree with your statements about Hopkins nor would I draft AJ over him. You have to think that he and AJ were in the SAME offense last year dealing with the same QB woes, and AJ was force fed targets because he led the team (146 to Nuks 127), and Hopkins still outproduced him and had a 1,200 yard 5 TD season. He's coming into his 3rd year which people say is the year for WR's. And he has all the opportunity in the world with less talented WR's around him - Cecil Shorts, Jaleen Strong, Nate Washington. I think he's in a better position to outproduce Johnson even though he's on a better offense with the best QB of his career.  I could also never bring myself to draft Andre Johnson over Cooks now that he will be the WR1 and Brees is still primed to throw for AT LEAST 400-450 times in a season barring injury. Sure, Nick Toon and Marques Colston are still there, but NO drafted Cooks with the intention of him being the stud WR1 they want to basically supplant Colston. They used him in the passing game but also on reverses, so he has rushing upside as well that Johnson never did. They will be much more dedicated to running and utilizing Spiller as well, but that's positive because it gives balance to the offense and keeps the box stacked so that you can open up the underneath for Cooks. His floor is much higher than AJ once again due to opportunity and youth. In my opinion, at least.   The same goes for Evans. Yes, he has a rookie QB, but that QB IS an upgrade over McCown and Glennon. He's looks NFL ready and news around football circles is that he looks great so far through minicamp and OTA's. Only time will tell there. But Evans is going to supplant Vjax, he already basically did last season meanwhile Vjax was still getting the majority of the targets (140 to Evans 123). Evans’ production wasn’t a product of volume. He ranked 24th among receivers in regular season targets (116), but 19 came in the end zone, which tied for fourth in the league. There's no reason to believe that this cannot continue. He's also actually somewhat athletic, more so than Benjamin - the only young WR I'm not drafting because I'm not a believer in his talent and Devin Funchess was drafted, too."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:01 2015 UTC,"Youth is very overrated in redraft, experience in the NFL is one of the most important factors in production because the ability for a WR to make smart reads and decisions are paramount to highly productive seasons. On top of that, sportsinjurypredictor's research has shown that older players miss games far less often than their youthful counterparts since they understand both how to take hits and how to prepare their bodies for the season.   Winston is a better passer, but being a better passer also means he's not going to force the ball into Evans when he doesn't have to. I also wrote that i don't think Evans is Winston's type of Wide Receiver and until preseason comes around and they show a noticeable chemistry, I don't see why I would take that kind of risk either in the 3rd round. Evans doesn't have the route running or timing that Winston loves to work with. Cooks struggled to get open in his rookie year and is being drafted entirely on potential, he was schemed open by the Saints and regardless of what his production might be, why would i take that kind of risk over a player who has a better floor and as high of a ceiling?  Here's a tweet from Matt Harmon's reception perception about cooks low success rate  Andre had some issues with O'Brien on the Texans that led to him asking for either a trade or release at the end of last year. Johnson had a hamstring injury last year that also affected him. As long as Hoyer is the expected starter, there is no way i can take Hopkins over AJ, Hoyer doesn't have the accuracy or the arm talent to get the ball to Hopkins consistently and I don't understand why this idea of ""he has less competition"" is a good thing, the lack of competition forces coverage to shift to Hopkins side and gives less scoring opportunities to the team. The Colts are going to finish top 8 in scoring this year while the Texans are looking like a bottom 16 finish. Andre's the only possession receiver the Colts have, so his targets are only barely affected by Hilton/Dorsett who only have 3 routes in their entire repertoire, and Moncrief is far from a starting caliber WR at this point in his career, but his targets are affected by Fleener/Allen. Luckily for AJ, Allen is injury prone and Fleener isn't a good player who's already had talk of his role being reduced in favor of 11 personnels."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,moonftball12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"While youth may be considered overrated I think in this day and age where we see younger kids step up to the NFL plate and deliver like your OBJ, Mike Evans, Jeremy Hill, et al., it's still a category to consider when drafting. You watch these super explosive young guys deliver in college and do unthinkable things and sometimes you believe it will transition into the NFL, then you end up drafting them over some proven commodities who are years into the NFL. Sometimes it's over guys who have been proven for numerous seasons, like your Andre Johnson, Brandon Marshall, Wes Welker etc. For example, now bare with me, if I brought to you two players and said to you ""You have to choose between these two guys you think is more explosive, talented, likely to stay healthy this season, and produce the most?"" The likely pick I bet, especially in this community, would be Mike Evans over Andre Johnson. If we are basing his skill set, opportunity, and likelihood of being healthy and playing all 16 games, then it's a no brainer that it's probably Evans > AJ. I would also have to disagree that with age you do not get injured as much as your younger counterparts. There's enough data out there that says as you age and injure connective tissue it does not retain its durability and elasticity it once did and something's such as sprains, pulls, tears do not heal as well as when you're younger, especially when you have a reoccurring injury (like a hammy). When you do draft you do consider whether the guy has experience or not, that's for sure, but you also draft based on potential - and Evans, Cooks, Benjamin all enter their sophmore year with youth on their side.   I agree with your notions about Winston, and he will most likely force some balls that he shouldn't just like all rookies do, but sometimes those chances do pay off and Mike Evans is the likely benefactor. And just for the record, I am personally NOT drafting Mike Evans this year. So I have no hidden investment in him and I am a Steeler fan, so everything I say is based off of what I've seen through college and NFL, just so we're clear. Regarding Cooks, I also agree that he was schemed very well in order for him to have the success he did before being injured. You say he's being drafted entirely on potential, but don't we all draft that way? Whether it's a 9th year veteran, sophmore, or rookie? All of the rookies we've mentioned carry some risk, but they also carry a ton of reward with them. Some are safer than others - I say Evans > Cooks > Benjamin (don't like that he's overweight and hurt his hammy and they drafted Funchess 1st round).  Lastly, regarding Brian Hoyer and AJ; we saw what Brian Hoyer did two years ago before getting his knee wrecked. I believe he went on a 4 game winning streak and he had a big time target in an emerging Josh Gordon. Hoyer has had little talent around him besides Gordon nor did he have consistency in the coaching staff. I don't think he's particularly talented, in fact I would contend that Mallet ends up winning the job by week 3-4. I think that will help Hopkins especially. Hopkins doesn't appear to be a QB dependent wideout, as seen last season with the QB changes that went on. While I disagree with most of your statements, we do both believe that Johnson is in a way better place with Luck and his supporting cast. That I will not argue. I really do like Andre Johnson, but I don't know if I like him enough as the WR2 on a Luck team when there's other 2nd year WR's emerging in their offenses as the WR1 and have clear talent, youth, speed, ability, etc all going for them.  Obviously we cannot truly know what's the likelihood of any of what we've said until we see them play in the preseason. Unfortunately, some do not have that luxury of waiting and drafting. I draft right before the regular season so this helps with things that we've discussed and performing some analysis of players. Good luck to you during the fantasy season!"
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,NannigarCire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:50 2015 UTC,"See, i draft conservatively which is why i am finding issue drafting these players. My first 4-5 rounds are based on taking players who i am absolutely certain will produce instead of looking at high upside players who don't have the talent level i'm looking for. Those guys all exist in the later rounds. Especially when they're not on teams with high scoring potential.  If we're basing it on skill and opportunity, i don't think Evans is even close to having Johnson beat. It doesn't take a lot of tape to see how Evans still significantly struggles with some of the more consistent parts of playing an NFL wide receiver. It doesn't take more than a look at the depth charts of each team to see that AJ's in a better situation. Not to mention, Evans entire dominance came in 3 weeks against 3 of the worst pass defenses the NFL had to offer. Not to try and compare them as equals but that was almost the same situation that got Doug Martin overdrafted.  Hopkins isn't a QB dependent player, you're right about that- but the QBs he played with last year were significantly better than Hoyer, specifically at throwing into covered players and taking risks. If Mallett gets the starting nod before the start of the season, i'll put Hopkins above AJ but that's an overwhelming factor in my ranking of them. I also would recommend taking a deeper look at Moncrief, he's nowhere close to emerging. He is a long term project."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,ChuckFinley_Burned,3,Tue Jul 21 18:31:59 2015 UTC,"I would put him just below those you have listed. Hopkins, Benjamin, Evans, Matthews, and Cooks will likely all have a slightly higher target volume and opportunity just based on being their teams WR1. Andre is going to play second fiddle to T.Y. Hilton. That is not a bad thing, he will get solid work and should see his scoring opportunities increase, but I wouldn't put him above those listed. That all being said I would not be afraid to have Andre as my WR2 or Flex play."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,theDarkAngle,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:09 2015 UTC,"Cant remember exactly, but I feel like he's been going in the 5th round or so in all the mocks I've done.  That to me is a bit too high.   I'd love to grab him in the 7th/8th though."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Khakbaugh,4,Tue Jul 21 01:02:12 2015 UTC,Yeah his ADP won't drop enough to be worth it for lots of people.

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Guido420,2,Tue Jul 21 00:58:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just figuring that he was regarded as one of the best wr's not too long ago and had like 1400 yards 2 seasons ago and may be playing in one of the best offenses in the league now and the best qb he's ever played with.
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,shanes3t,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"I like him.  I may like him better than all of those guys, but I'm not drafting Andre ahead of them.  I've been doing most of my mocks on ESPN, and their ADPs are as follows:   Evans(30) Kelvin(34) Hopkins(38) Cooks(41) Matthews(44) Andre Johnson(56)   Meaning, I can even take Matthews and still have a shot at Andre Johnson the next round.  I will tell you that I like Andre Johnson at his ADP way better than any of these other guys.  That may change by the time I actually draft and I'll have to make these tough decisions.  For now I'm happier to see him on my team than any of these other players (Hopkins comes closest).  Edit:  What the hell, they renumbered my ADPs.  Will try to fix."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,moonftball12,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:55 2015 UTC,I've been passing on Kelvin and waiting for Cooks/Matthews and getting Johnson in the 55-60 range consistently when I've been stuck for a #2 WR.
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,tomseymour12,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"I am VERY high on Andre Johnson this season and let's start by taking a look at some numbers, shall we? In the 12 years he has been in the league he has posted seven 1,000+ receiving yard seasons, and came within 24 and 64 yards of having two additional 1,000 receiving yard seasons as well. If you total his career TD's and average them across all 12 years, he scores 5.333 TD's a season typically. If you average his career receiving totals you get 1,133 yards. If you take both these averages, completely disregarding the fact that he has missed several games over his career, but as of late has been consistent and healthy, and you apply this to fantasy numbers then you're looking at about 149 points +/- some points. 149 points last year was good enough to be WR14 in standard scoring and tied with none other then Megatron himself. 149 points equates to being ahead of guys like DJax, Kelvin Benjamin, DeAndre Hopkins, Mike Wallace, Torrey Smith, AJ Green, Brandon LaFell, etc. You get the point. Very respectable numbers put up by some of the leagues best, too, if we are basing this on averages. What really happened last year, which we can discuss, was Andre Johnson scored only 98 points in standard scoring and was the WR42 in fantasy.  Andre led his team in targets despite the highly talented DeAndre Hopkins just opposite of him - who did siphon his fair share as well. A lot of problems stemmed from the ever so apparent inconsistency issues between Fitzpatrick and Mallet, and this isn't the first time there's been some inconsistency at the helm of the most important position on offense. Throughout his career Andre Johnson has dealt with the likes of David Carr, Matt Schaub, T.J. Yates, Sage Rosenfels, Case Keenum, Ryan Fitzmagic, Ryan Mallet, and Tom Savage. There in that list lies no true play maker or play caller nonetheless.   You take Andre Johnson and you put him on arguably one of the most high powered offenses in football - I'd even say just a notch above Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay now due to their additions of Gore and AJ - and there is bound to be some fireworks about to happen. Luck gets a solid built Andre Johnson at 6'3 who, although is aging and a bit slower, he is still damn consistent and hungry as ever. He's never had a QB like Luck and in his 13th season he'll finally get that. This is the perfect scenario set up for a sneaky draft pick where you would ultimately end up getting a high end WR2 for someone who's ADP is more consistent with being a WR3.   With all that being said, I clearly do like Andre Johnson's ability still, regardless of age, and I love the situation he is in with Luck. Even with obvious receiving threats like TY, Moncrief, Allen, Dorsett, and even Gore in the picture this shouldn't take away from what Pagano and beat writers are saying and it's basically that he looks ""rejuvenated"" and ""he's going to have a big role."" Couple that with the sheer volume that Luck throws and that this is a playoff team, then I think he could be in for at least a 1,200-1400 rec yard season and at least 8-10 TDs (10 would be a career high)."

Fist off, people are raving about how his situation has improved somuch from last year, but there are A LOT of mouths to feed in that offense so his target numbers will be inconsistent at best. Combine that with the fact that Jonson isn't really a big play guy or a huge redzone threat, and I don't see the numbers being there. I think he can be an extremely valuable player for the Colts, but I don't think it will translate to fantasy production.    The thing that really scares me the most tho, is that he had the 5th most targets of any WR in the NFL last year, yet he didn't even break the top 30 in fantasy. Yes, he caught passes from shitty QBs, but Hopkins caught passes from the same guys  and he was really good on less targets."

Last year he ranked 5th in the league in targets which he converted into about a wr40 finish (0.77 fantasy pts per target). I can't put the blame on poor Qb play because deandre finished top 15 on less targets.   Now he's playing with one of the top qb's in the league, but his targets should drop dramatically as the #2 option (at best). If he couldn't do it with high volume targets as the #1 option, how much can I expect his efficiency to increase with decreased targets.   Last years #2 wr in indi was a combination of Wayne, nicks, and moncrief. That is essentially the role that AJ is sliding into. Is that role worth a 4th round pick? Not for me."

fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Str8F4zed,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:50:36 2015 UTC,I personally am high on Andre Johnson and think he is underrated going into this year.. but I think that all of those receivers will have a better season then Andre because they are going to do superb themselves. Not saying it is going to be a big difference but they have a much higher ceiling then Andre.
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,JSCuadros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Chiming in a bit late here but that's okay, right? I'll go ahead and rank the receivers you mentioned. Let's assume we're talking about standard scoring.  Evans > Cooks > Andre/Benjamin/Hopkins > Matthews  Mike Evans is a top 10 WR this season. Cooks is a high end WR2 for most leagues, should be fantastic in PPR. Take those guys if you can. Now things get a bit sticky.  Right now I don't think there's a reason to distinguish AJ/Kelvin/Hopkins in terms of projected points at the end of the season. You need to look at your team, anticipate the players you'll want/be capable of getting and make the best decision possible.  IMO Andre has the highest ceiling of the three. Luck is a stud, definitely the best QB AJ has ever played with, and the Colts offense is poised to do very well. I'm not 100% sure T.Y. runs away in the targets battle. Consistency is key. However, there are some concerns. The Colts have a stronger run game and the NFCS is terrible. Will they really need to throw the ball often? Age is definitely a factor. Can he stay healthy and avoid fatigue?  So you need to ask yourself, do you want to use a late 3rd/early 4th on the old lottery ticket? Or a WR like Hopkins or Benjamin that have little to no competition on the field, on a team that should often be playing from behind?  Don't get me wrong, the other guys have concerns too. Hopkins basically doesn't have a QB and the Texans know Arian is their true weapon. Kelvin was largely disappointing last season and began the off-season overweight and seemingly demotivated. But both of them will lead their team in targets though and have already developed a rapport with their QB.  To wrap up, if it's the 3rd round and you've already taken a WR, don't be afraid to take AJ. If you're still looking for a WR1 I'd be most comfortable with Hopkins in that role."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,nweimer,0,Mon Jul 20 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"Tough to compare him to a player of Reggie Wayne's caliber, but why can't he fill right in for Reggie? Reggie produced last year till the injuries hit. If you take Andre's ADP and you're told you'll get Reggie Waynes numbers the first half of the season, I think its GREAT value."
fantasyfootball,3dzyt7,Tomoromo9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:51:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to compare Andre Johnson to a player of Wayne's caliber. That's exactly what he is. Not to be a nerd but I think its important to bring up Wayne's first half stats. Wayne had 63 yds/game and 0.25 TDs/game through the first 8 games. And did even worse the second half (34 yds/game and no TDs). That being said, he did have 116 targets, though, so maybe Johnson could do more with the opportunities. It would still be quite a drop from the number targets Johnson is used to getting. Johnson is a guy that consistently ranks in the top 5 most targets wideouts in the league-5th last year, 2nd in 2013, 5th in 2012, and so on..."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,RealMikeTrout27,47,Mon Jul 20 20:59:59 2015 UTC,"The problem for the Bucs wasn't ever stacked boxes. They had a respectable passing game. The problem is that their o-line is the worst in the NFCS. And considering they share space with the Falcons and Panthers in that contest, that's a hell of a statement. That situation hasn't really improved, so it's hard to imagine that their run game will take a huge step forward."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,BlindWillieJohnson,14,Mon Jul 20 21:45:49 2015 UTC,They did draft two new linemen.
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,uaretheeggman,16,Tue Jul 21 01:41:14 2015 UTC,"They did. I actually think Marpet was a good pick, and a solid guard prospect, but he probably won't start right away. Smith was drafted as a tackle though, and I have no faith in rookie tackles."

fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,BlindWillieJohnson,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:48 2015 UTC,"There have been many rookie tackles that have had good seasons. Still, I mostly agree with you. It's possible that the oline takes a step forward this season though."

fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"I really don't think you watch the Falcons all that much. When fully healthy, the Falcons o-line is just a little worse the average. The problem they've had the past two years is injuries. For example, last year, our TE (who isn't even very good at blocking) had to play RT because we didn't have anyone healthy who could play it.   Jake Matthews also did pretty well last year. He wasn't great, but he had some really solid games and was playing through injury for a lot of it."

fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,RichardShermanator,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Depth isn't the main factor. But in something like D-line, O-line, secondary (where injuries are the norm) it's a big deal. Especially in O-lines. The bottom 5 of everything always say,""well if we didn't have injuries""...everyone has injuries. That's part of the game."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,mikeditka23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"Dude, PFF worst graded tackle in the league was Jake Matthews. He was bad last year. And that's fine because he was a rookie thrust into a tough position, and there's plenty of time to turn things around, but pretending that he was anything other than awful is just...false. Asamoah was pretty rough too. Until I see otherwise (and as a Panthers fan, I see plenty of your games) I think it's safe to say that the line is still an issue."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:47 2015 UTC,"PFF grades should be taken with a grain of salt. He wasn't awful, and I really don't know how to prove that to you except by telling you to watch the games. For example, look at how he did against his cousin Clay Matthews -- he played a very solid game. The line is definitely still and issue, especially since we haven't really addressed like we did our other needs (pass rusher), but it's not 32nd in the league like our defense was last season."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,RichardShermanator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"I don't even think that your line was 32nd in the league.

fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,mynameisjimi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:27 2015 UTC,This is exactly the right answer for me. If I can draft him as a bench player with RB2 upside then i'm all about it. If I have to take him as a RB2 i'll look elsewhere.
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,exxplosiv,6,Tue Jul 21 14:05:36 2015 UTC,At his ADP he's one of a very few potential 200+ carry backs. It might not be pretty but if he wins the starting job he'll probably be worth it. The offense will be better as a whole and I think it's important to remember that their original OC last year had to sit out with health issues and they ended up having a guy that wasn't qualified for the job take over. Dirk Koetter is a big plus.  Note: After typing this comment I went and double checked Martin's ADP. On ESPN where I usually mock its 94 which is what I was going off of. On FFcalc it is 72 and I wouldn't touch him that high.
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,Thehawkiscock,5,Mon Jul 20 23:00:15 2015 UTC,"I don't like him.  I never have.  I've been taking him a lot in mocks this year though; I'm having trouble passing on him at his ADP.  If he regains 75% of his 2012 form, then he will be one hell of a flex or trade bait.  People talk about how he got a lot of his stats in just a couple games; but all it takes is one of those games while he's sitting on my bench and I can package him in a deal; or if I had him in at flex then I probably won that week.  That's worth a late round gamble for me.  I'm looking at his ADP on ESPN and seeing who's going around him.  There are some handcuffs I would think about taking to complement an earlier pick, most notably Tre Mason if I have Gurley.  But if you're thinking about an RB for upside without needing an injury I think it's a matter of preference.  Some of the guys going near him that are not strictly handcuffs:  Blount  Crowell  Ivory  Abdullah  Sankey  Freeman  Sims  West  Pick your poison.  They're all long shots.  But I think Doug Martin is a high upside choice in this group (along with Blount).  I would take most of these guys (not Sankey of course, haha) before I took someone else's handcuff.  Not that anyone asked, but I'll rank these guys anyway.  Blount, Martin, Abdullah/Ivory, Crowell, I'm not drafting the rest of these guys.  Also since nobody asked, I will tell you who else I am targeting at RB at the end of my drafts:  If I own Miller, I will draft Ajayi if I feel like he may get drafted by someone else.  The Dolphins hate Miller, also I feel like Miller may be a bit undersized and more prone to injury when given a full workload.  Montee Ball.  If receivers kept falling to me and I don't have my usual 6-8 RBs by the final 4 rounds, then I will take a flier on this guy.  After the RB carousel of the last two years in Denver, coupled with the insane production you get from whoever gets the nod behind Peyton, I think Ball is worth a late pick.  David Cobb.  I'm not really good at evaluating college talent.  In fact I'm not even sure what position this guy got drafted in.  But when I look at the Titans, I think this guy has really good sleeper potential.  His competition is Bishop Stankey, so short path to playing time.  Also, the Titans drafted Mariotta, and I think we've decided at this point that having a mobile QB is good for RBs.  So, for last round long shots, I could see him having RB2-Flex upside.  Also, my snake is a 10-man, so that is how I view the snake draft world."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,Guido420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:45:57 2015 UTC,I feel the exact same way as you. Just wanted to chip in from an auction standpoint and say I've been taking him and Ball for $1 or $2 at the end of drafts on the off chance they end up starting and being productive.
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,Sir_Lord_Baltimore,16,Tue Jul 21 12:09:32 2015 UTC,I don't like him. His ypc has dropped every year and he has not looked good in a long time. Rainey looked better last year and people think the coaching staff might go with their guy Sims
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,xsvfan,4,Mon Jul 20 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Seems like Dirk Koetter likes him enough. And what I like about him is that he is proven. You have seen his upside no matter when. But if you draft for example Jay Ajayi before him, you take a huge gamble."
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,shootout101,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:44 2015 UTC,"I don't like a proven 3.6 and 3.7 ypc player unless they catch a lot of passes like forte.

fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,zimmeli,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:46:01 2015 UTC,It all comes down to what you believe. I see his potential as the last two years. His first year was an anomaly and he has regressed to the mean. You might want to look into the gamblers fallacy. Basically just because an event has not happened does not make it more likely to happen. E.g. you flip a coin and get 8 heads in a row does not mean you're more likely to flip a tails.
fantasyfootball,3dzpe6,xsvfan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I see that for sure. I don't necessarily like him but I would use a late round flier on him

I really have very little faith in him whatsoever but if he shows a decent preseason I might draft him late if he falls to me. I don't even know his ADP right now so maybe he's a bargain wherever it stands, I just don't know. The problem is that O-line is atrocious and drafting rookie linemen and thrusting them into a starting role doesn't always bode well for RB's. Offensive linemen and QB are probably the two most difficult positions to adjust and learn in the NFL. If he doesn't have a competent line then I'm not sure I'd feel any different than I did last year. Sure, Jameis might keep some defenses honest with his big arm, and Mike Evans, VJax, and ASF (possible sleeper candidate) are big time vertical threats, so I guess I could see someone making the case that they help stretch the field and open some lanes for him."

It's on the absolute fringes of being meaningful.

I feel like Mike Evans is going to be a big beneficiary of the hire. It MIGHT open up the running game's lanes for Martin and for that reason I'll pick up the Hamster if he's available in Round 6+.

Sure those, numbers last year are very much a result of a great O-Line, but he is still probably a top 5 back in the league after Bell, Lynch, Charles and (maybe) Peterson. He is definitely better than Shady at this point, and I am a Bills fan."

I just question whether the difficult matchups this year might not put them below similarly ranked players who face easier schedules this year than last.    For example:  Dez Bryant might be worth considering drafting over Brown because the NFC East faces the NFC South and the AFC East, who have an average points allowed to WR ranking that is better (13.625) than the NFC West and AFC South, which they faced last year (18)."

fantasyfootball,3e01t9,qp0n,16,Mon Jul 20 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"I think people have very short memories. Two years ago, we didn't take rookie WRs because they were almost never worth the ADP. Then we had some really good ones (the best statistical class ever, even) and now we forget. Same reason why we went nuts after getting 3 of the 4 best rookie QBs ever in 2 years on rookie QBs. temper expectations."

Every time you draft a receiver, you draft his QB and offensive situation with him."

And a Buccaneers 2nd year receiver who is catching balls from a rookie QB (that I'm also drafting) to be my WR1. Also, I'm drafting Melvin Gordon in the 3rd. Then, when 4 weeks into the season it becomes clear that everyone on my team is under-preforming their ADP because I drafted them at a spot where everything has to break exactly right in order for them to just match their ADP, I will trade all of them away for Jonathan Steward, the #4 fantasy RB, who gets injured 2 weeks later and makes me quit fantasy football forever.

fantasyfootball,3e0tjr,JesC929,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:04 2015 UTC,I have no IDP experience... So I'm no expert... But those seem like standard prices to me. In my auction experience... The stud players go for about 1/3 of the cap.
fantasyfootball,3e0tjr,GOTaSMALL1,3,Tue Jul 21 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"Antonio Brown was the best position player in PPR last year. ESPN gives him an auction value of $54 out of a $200 budget. If you scale Antonio's $161 out of a $750 budget, that becomes $43. Clearly a ""steal"" compared to ESPN's value.   However, $54 is for a 10 team league with 9 starters (not 17). I'm honestly not sure what typical IDP picks go for, but with more roster spots (34?!) to fill, that means each player on an owner's team gets slightly less (on average). But with 12 owners, the market gets inflated a bit, since there is more money in the market. I'm not sure how the tradeoff of more money in the market, with each owner needing that money to go further compares to a standard league, but my gut feeling is that those auction values so far are relative steals."

fantasyfootball,3e0tjr,Vacar,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Those are actually suuuuper low.  You could have essentially gotten Julio, OBJ, Bryant, Gronk, and Brown (5 OF THE BEST PLAYERS FOR DYNASTY) and still had $59 left over. I'd stack some studs before people realize that these players are going insanely low. The fact that top-5 players are going for less than 1/6 of your budget is insane.  Here's a startup that we did over in /r/dynastyff a few months ago with members of the community. I still think some of those prices are low.  Edit: There were 30 roster spots (QB, RB, WR, TE only) with a budget of $1000. I'm Signature Talent if you want to see to strategy I used."

For example, lets imagine here that the other guys would have pushed you up a few more dollars on each bid, lets say to $150, $10 more than their current price.  That means for $600 you would have 3 of the top 5 WR (1's), and a top RB 1 (probably talking of Forte/Mccoy/Murray/Hil/CJ)... in a 12 man team with another $150 to spend on a QB/TE (you will be taking low places here obviously a Palmer, maybe reach for a Cam, and then take a chance on Davis) and RB 2 (I would personally take some gambles on Yeldon/Gordon type players here) and your defense... thats insane. I believe you are incredibly lucky to get 3 elite players and your telling me you could of had 4?!  As somebody else suggested you better get your act together before the rest of your league realise the same thing."
fantasyfootball,3e0tjr,mattycoop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:16:38 2015 UTC,The way i determine whether or not a player is worth their salary is the same way you determine a player's value in DFS(Daily Fantasy Sports). I will take their monetary value and divide it by the expected points (usually an aggregation between projections and last year's numbers). This will give you a points per dollar value. This way you can compare players across all positions to determine which players are worth the money.
fantasyfootball,3e3gd7,Jk186861,4,Tue Jul 21 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"Draft books/magazines have become largely obsolete in recent years. So much of that same info is available online for free that the magazines just aren't worth it.

fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,dagmarlena,7,Tue Jul 21 01:05:25 2015 UTC,I would say have your keepers start next year so everyone is on the same level. The guy who has OBJ would love to start this year but it's going to be hard to convince a guy who missed out on the waiver last year to miss out on drafting him this year.   In my keeper league the only eligible keepers are players drafted round 10 and after as well as free agents. This also gives the team who picks last in round 1 get the first selection for the keeper round. Good luck!
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,beatty31,6,Tue Jul 21 03:11:34 2015 UTC,"I think all FAs should be keepable. This entices everyone to be active on the waiver wire week in and week out, especially teams with losing records. Not only does this increase competitiveness during the current season, but it gives losers a chance to come back the next year and win, lessening the chance of having to fill keeper league holes (which is a whole other issue).  As far as what penalty you choose, I think there are several ways to do it. I think you should reward those who hit on the waiver wire. A tenth round pick is just fine in this case. Totally reasonable.  Another thing you could do is increase the round per year kept. For example, let's say someone keeps ODB and that's the 10th round pick. Next year, he'll be an 8th. The next, a 6th. Then you cap it where no one can keep anyone within the first two rounds. This makes finding value late and in the season more valuable, but it's balanced."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,SandyDFS,2,Tue Jul 21 02:55:59 2015 UTC,"For my league, you have to draft your keeper and keep them on your roster the whole year. We also limit keepers to 3 years (after the same guy had AP in the 10th for 5 years in a row)."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,desertrat113,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:30:03 2015 UTC,The idea is you are suppose to make the keeper cost the next round up every year so people can't keep them for long. AP starting from the 10th would still be worth it forever though.
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,kpyle,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:55 2015 UTC,Any FA keepers begin at the 12th round (takes more foresight to draft a player you can see breaking out instead of waiting for them to do so midseason). If you keep 2 FAs it's the 12th and 11th. 3 keepers at a 2 round price
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,Aceoangels,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:19:47 2015 UTC,"Our league is very unique I feel. We keep 10 players and get 10 draft picks. Also, we do drop 2 players to add 1.   So after your keepers and draft picks you should have 20 players. To add a free agent after the draft you'd have to drop 2 players to add 1 this putting you down to 19 players.    Makes things a bit more complicated."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,DrKillFactory,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:59 2015 UTC,"We have 18 players each. We keep 7 players (no more, no less) every year.   We can't pick Free Agent all year long. We live and die with our picks in the draft at the beginning of the year. We can trade with other teams. We have a lottery at the end of the year so the #1, #2 and #3 positions in the draft aren't secured. That way, you can tank if you want to pick your favorite FA, but it can bite you in the ass too.   For exemple, this year, the 5 first picks of the draft should be CJ Anderson, Jeremy Hill, OBJ, Mike Evans and Justin Forsett.   I like it that way!"
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,Ferg8,2,Tue Jul 21 03:42:56 2015 UTC,No one drafted Jeremy Hill in 18 rounds last year?

fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,Ferg8,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"Our league distinguishes between drafted players and undrafted free agents.  For example, last year I drafted Jonathan Stewart in the 12th round, dropped him at some point, and another team picked him up.  That other team can keep him based on 12th round status (in the case of our league, they'd lose their 10th round pick to do so).  I picked up Latavius Murray (who no team drafted) in-season.  I get to keep him as an undrafted free agent (I'd lose my 7th round pick).  We also escalate picks over time (so keeping Murray in 2016 would cost me my 5th rounder), can't keep more than 3 players, and can't keep guys for more than 2 or 3 years.    I feel like this offers a good balance.  Even teams who are out of the playoffs have a reason to stay active in the league in case prospects for 2016 emerge late in the year.  You get some reward for identifying good free agents, but not such a significant reward that it gives a ridiculous advantage to people who happen to hit on the best free agents.  It also forces you to be careful about who you drop, as that talented player you identified might end up helping your opponents if you drop the player before they pan out."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,uncchris2001,2,Tue Jul 21 04:04:40 2015 UTC,We go with no one drafted between the 1st and 5th round or the previous years keepers can be kept.  This prevents the top level guys from being kept every year.  Also puts the utmost importance on the back end of the draft as well as free agents (as long as they weren't drafted in the first five rounds and cut).
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,fdotwilliams,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:33 2015 UTC,My league considers undrafted free agents to be equal to a 6th round pick.
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,whiskeytango55,2,Tue Jul 21 07:11:30 2015 UTC,I am the commish of my league and  it has been a keeper league for 3 years.  We allow each team to keep up to 3 players from their previous year roster. You can only keep one player per position (so no 2 WR/RB etc). The keeper rounds are 3-5. If you elect to only keep 2 players you receive your third round pick. This has worked well so far without having to rank keepers to determine which round they apply to.
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,dlkilla77,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:21 2015 UTC,"My keeper let's you keep one player starting from round 4 (can't keep anyone you drafted in the first three rounds). If you picked up a free agent and keep them, then you get to keep them for a 13th round pick.   Hello 13th round OBJ."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,PrinceAli311,2,Tue Jul 21 12:52:10 2015 UTC,"Our league is ppr. So we use the espn PPR top 300 list. When keepers are due, the most up to date list is what we use to place keepers. So owners start looking at value as well. Quick rule rundown is easiest to explain.   2 keepers from your final roster of last season.  Can only keep 1 player per round. (I have AP and OBJ ranked in the 1st, can only keep one) Players can only be kept once, then they go back in the draft. (This actually encourages trading of high level players in your second year of having them.   So this year I am looking at keeping AP and Calvin Johnson, but the ESPN PPR top 300 still has Randle ranked 80th, but his ADP is 5th round (10 team league) so I might let Calvin go if Randles Ranking stays where it's at.   We all decided that was the easiest way to fairly deal with free agent keepers."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,kiyobrown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:05 2015 UTC,"My leagues keeper rules are very simple. Each team keeps 3 players from last year's final roster. Keep anybody you want, no position restrictions or draft costs. Yes most of the elite players are always kept, but there's always some good players available at the top of the draft for the bad teams to improve with. For instance the top picks look like they will be Arian Foster, AJ Green, and CJ Anderson."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,TURRRDS,2,Tue Jul 21 12:05:37 2015 UTC,"My league allows each team 2 keepers per year - players drafted before the 5th round are not eligible to be kept and FA pickups are 10th round picks.   We have a rule that any player can only be kept twice (so 3 years on your team) before they must reenter the draft pool. That way ODB, Mike Evans, CJ ANderson, etc. can be keptand valuable but they aren't lifetime 10th round picks. This has worked well for us, guys like jimmy graham, gronk, julio, dex, DT were all STUD keepers for 2 years but are back to 1st/2nd round picks now."

Owners who pick up a FA are rewarded with a $1/year steal for the first 2 years, but then the 3rd year, the player's salary jumps to an average for the Top 10 at the position.  Example: I got Ellington for $1 2 years ago. I got to keep him last year for $1 as well. However, this year, his salary shoots up to $24, so I won't keep him.  I think this system helps keep the league balanced."
fantasyfootball,3e0l6s,crucialmind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:26 2015 UTC,"We are allowed to keep 1 - 3 players depending on the year. Keepers must be 4th round or later.   Free agent keepers are kept the same round as the latest drafted keeper. The idea is that there are hundreds of waiver claims. Managers must show discipline using their waiver claims effectively. They should not lose a draft pick earlier than a drafted keeper. The odds of picking up a keeper off waivers are less than picking a keeper in the draft. Also, every team had an opportunity to pick up the free agent."

Algholor could be a no-brainer starter or someone who is dropped by week 6."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,humanhighlightreel,9,Mon Jul 20 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah - the value of a player should take into account his upside, his floor, your confidence in the pick, and value above replacement. Nelson's upside is a little higher, definitely, but his floor is also lower and your confidence should be lower since he's a rookie and we don't have as much data to go on. And of course value above replacement is by definition worse since his adp is lower.   I also think Colston and Lafell have more upside than you may think. Jimmy Graham is gone and he had 900 yds on 85 receptions last year - those are going somewhere, Colston should pick up a few. LaFell looked great in his first season in New England with 950 yds on 74 receptions and 7tds - they're probably going to use him a little more/better this year, don't you think?"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,SassyMoron,42,Mon Jul 20 17:25:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nelson's upside is a 'little' higher.'   His ceiling is super-duper high... Like, Maclin high.   My strategy is always to start taking high-upside guys when it's time for my bench (maybe one more 'solid' pick to fill in as flex)...   But after my starting RBs WRs, and my starting flex... I'm going for upside. I don't want Colston on my team - those targets and touchdowns from Graham ARE going to go somewhere... To Cooks, and Spiller, and maybe Toon. The chances of Colston being a legit WR1 are zero (imo)... The chances of him being a legit WR2 are very small.   The chances of Nelson putting up legit WR1 numbers by the end of the season? Not high, but not 0. His chances of putting up legit WR2 numbers are 'okay.' His chances of being a total bust are pretty good too... But I don't care about that from my bench players. Floor doesn't matter much on my bench. I'm going to need guys to drop anyway when players emerge on the waiver.   My bench is going to be full of guys who, if things go well, could give me starting-player numbers, and if they don't go well, I can drop them like a bad habit.   I don't want to draft a guy who is likely to perform at his ADP when I'm drafting in round 7, 8, 9, etc.  I'd rather have 5 guys on my bench who might go bonkers, and only have one of them pan out, then have 5 guys on my bench who live up to their ADP."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,sweatybronson,6,Mon Jul 20 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"Colston, who was battling injury for most of last year, finished as the 31st best receiver. He was averaging almost 6.5 targets a game and caught 4 TD's over his last 6 games during the Saints playoff push. Graham's red-zone absence is actually a good thing for Colston, and I'd put him above Spiller (and certainly Toon) in terms of who benefits most from Graham leaving.   I don't think his chances at finishing in the top 24 are 'very small' if we believe what he's been saying about being healthy again and excited to play. If you're talking about taking players late who have a good chance to outperform their ADP, Colston (currently late 10th/early 11th round) is a good candidate. And really, since Agholor (who I do like) is going mid to early 7th, the two players are not comparable in terms of who you'd gamble on. You have plenty of room and time during a draft to grab both."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,bencalpink,3,Mon Jul 20 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Good thinking - I don't think I'm wrong to be as high as I am on Agholor, but I may be too low on Colston?"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,sweatybronson,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:32 2015 UTC,"Well in my opinion yes. I think after 5-6 games go by and it seems like Colston has not put something together that would net him little above 900 and 5 again, obviously feel free to cut bait. But with NO's biggest red-zone threat gone, and Colston saying he's anxious to play again, I think late 10th early 11th is a cheap investment with higher upside compared to most other players going around that time."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,bencalpink,3,Mon Jul 20 22:02:39 2015 UTC,"To build on your point, I think in Yahoo where there's 0 W/R/T and 3WR, that WR3 is your most important position. You really need a high upside WR there and you need 3 quality guys since everyone has the same restriction.  With 2WR/2RB and the flex like you have, you can tailor that matchup. If the team you're playing has a WR in flex who is risky, you might want to go RB just to take the points. If they have a stud RB in flex, you are going to need to bet on a big play WR.  Use flex to play your weekly matchup."

(see, that's when hype is shtoopid...)  But yeah, that's a pretty good comparison - and Agholor could easily have a better season than Watkins did, considering that Nelson's in a far superior offense."

He has little big play ability left in him, and isn't dominant enough of a possession receiver to get the 120+ targets that made him a borderline WR1 in 2012."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well, Colston's targets are going to go up, that's all I'm saying. Probably not to 120, but maybe enough to hit 1000 yards. I think that gives him a lot of upside relative to his ADP - probably more upside relative to his ADP than Agholor.   I agree with you about ""big play ability"" and ""dominant"" btw - I just don't tend to bet on those sorts of things, try to stick to the data."

LaFell still has great upside, but has been inconsistent so far. He's on a nice trajectory in his 2nd full season getting used to Tom.   I mostly agree with what you're saying, just that I find LaFell better than Agholor, but I am predicting Agholor will get seen sooner in Bradford's progression. Agholor will be at worst the #3 read on maybe 30-40% of plays. LaFell will be the 4th read and worse on 50% of plays.   That's why he's been inconsistent. Same thing with NE RBs. It's all in how they gameplan these guys. The only dude you can count on being the first or second read consistently is Gronk."

Although I find this one hard to believe, if it's true then Chip is a great scout of talent.  It also leads me to believe that he wouldn't want to miss out for a 2nd year in a row.  He did spend a 1st round pick on Algohor. Algolor's 2014 college stats: 104-1313-12.  I don't allow college stats to translate to NFL performance, but it's something to look at.

A receiver's hand problem is coachable, and also exaggerated by a QB who makes inaccurate rocket throws all the time because he's running for his life and trying to get the ball out as quickly as possible.  As for Funchess, that fits with the David Gettleman strategy of drafting versatile players. Funchess can block, run several route trees, play in TE slots and create matchup problems. KB got slammed for his hands too, and that ended up working out well enough that I could see him being productive."

fantasyfootball,3dya93,shack026,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:02 2015 UTC,i would guess he's talking about amari  i feel like those 2 are the most ready receivers when it comes to route running
fantasyfootball,3dya93,CaptainHawkmed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"What's the reasoning behind that? Just curious, as I'm not nearly as high on Amari Cooper as Nelson"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Linkfoursword,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"i think he's speaking more from a draft prospect perspective than a FF perspective, but again, I filled in the blank so he may not have even been talking about Cooper  Amari was considered the most polished and ready receiver in the draft w/ White being considered more raw  Agholor is a great route runner as well and I think he was considered pretty NFL ready along with Cooper, unlike some of the other WR prospects from the draft that are seen as raw, but high potential due to their physical tools, but still need some work on refining their game"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,CaptainHawkmed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:51:00 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Not saying Amari couldn't be great but he's in a system that has a lot of work to do unlike Chip's offense.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Linkfoursword,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:15 2015 UTC,"For a FF perspective, I'm all with you there...but I do like Amari this year as well and I think he could end up as a decent WR3 in most leagues, maybe a low-end WR2 in PPR  The hype on some of these other WR's and their ADP's may not provide a steal like grabbing Cooper could"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,CaptainHawkmed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:10 2015 UTC,Who are you considering first? Cooper?
fantasyfootball,3dya93,DarkestTimelineJeff,4,Mon Jul 20 19:47:53 2015 UTC,"The hype surrounding Agholor stems from the obvious Chip Kelly system and the less obvious for those who haven't watched Agholor, he's a more dynamic version of Jeremy Maclin. With Matthews remaining in his spot as a big slot receiver where he's best, Agholor is pretty much the defacto #1 Outside WR, making him a potential day 1 fantasy value. More likely Agholor will take two or three weeks to get into rhythm, on tape there's some concentration issues in his game and a few 'overly dynamic' moments (he likes to lose yardage to try and gain yardage) but he's already a decent route runner who's not afraid of contact with good football instincts."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,NannigarCire,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"He's a talented WR with a high football IQ, a team first mentality, and well spoken young man who wont cause locker room problems and will stay out of trouble off the field. And he is on a high powered offense. So the hype is based on his potential to have a high volume of opportunities."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Bear2120,3,Mon Jul 20 18:46:45 2015 UTC,Very talented guy taking over for Maclin. There are no other quality WR's aside from Matthews so he has a high chance at success here
fantasyfootball,3dya93,XCypher73,3,Mon Jul 20 17:15:07 2015 UTC,Watch him run a post route. End of discussion.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,MatrixMonkey,3,Mon Jul 20 17:18:17 2015 UTC,His game lacks any major deficiencies that would bottleneck his ability to produce as a rookie. That combined with his being a presumptive starter on a remarkably efficient and productive offense is why his ADP is as high as it is.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,SaltyMagician,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:43 2015 UTC,"Chip Kelly's offense will have the most offensive plays per game. Though, his system wont likely have a single target being considered the go-to receiver (or rb for that matter), there will be plenty of snaps to go around."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,masteroftheuniverse6,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:28 2015 UTC,"How is he a 6th round pick? Yahoo says his average draft position is in the 13th round? and he's ranked the 88th best player on yahoo, which places him just outside the top 35 WRs. thats great value in my eyes - thats why there is such hype. He could potentially be a solid WR2/3 this season. Maybe even better if Bradford thrives in philly"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,odellbeckham13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:36 2015 UTC,There have been thousands of money drafts already. Agholor rarely if ever makes it to the 8th.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Canadaismyhat,2,Tue Jul 21 00:13:01 2015 UTC,"1st round pick, similar playing style to Maclin, A system that has produced a top tier WR with different players two years in a row, Matthews, a second rounder also produced top 25 numbers. If it was a proven receiver going into that situation he would be a third round pick. You're getting Agholor in later rounds because he is unproven as an NFL receiver. If you want to know how good of a player he is you can read one of the 23948394573450 scouting reports out there.   Basically, first round pedigree+Chip Kelly system is all that is needed to justify his ADP"
fantasyfootball,3dya93,SayNoob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"He's probably the best RAC wr in this year's class; Amari Cooper and Kevin White are gifted with bigger bodies but I think Agholor will be ODB-esque. Also he is the most versatile of the class, meaning he can line up outside, slot and in the backfield. He will most likely return kicks and punts for them as well. I think he's already better than Jordan Mathews. Injury is my only concern because he is going to have the ball a lot. PPR he is going to be an absolute stud, standard I think top 30 is a definite with the offense he's in. He's the new deep threat and what's Bradford best known for? (His deep ball)  Like I do before every fantasy season, watch some rookie highlights and pay attention to the unteachable skill sets. Even watching interviews can give u a better understanding of a player is ready prior to the season.  Agholor's ADP is going to sky rocket after the preseason once people see how versatile and skilled the kid really is. I'm targeting him in every draft and he is solely the only Eagle I'm interested in this year. Maybe Ertz."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Chrisnualah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:01 2015 UTC,"DeSean Jackson thrived in that wr1, Maclin had same huge success, the hype comes at the argument that Algholor will be taking over that role."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,mj62,2,Mon Jul 20 16:12:56 2015 UTC,"He's essentially Jeremy Maclin 2.0 in terms of measurables. Doesn't promise production, but everyone who bid $1 on Jeremy Maclin last year, is interested to see what the kid can do. And if you did, holla."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Loop_Within_A_Loop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:24 2015 UTC,Chips offense puts up numbers. He will be the most talented outside WR on the team (Matthews is a slot wr unless they try him outside) and will have tons of opportunity to touch the ball. He is essentially expected to be the Eagles number 1 target despite being a rookie.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,BeanFlickinMachine,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:59 2015 UTC,I wrote an article about Agholor explaining the situation.

fantasyfootball,3dya93,TheSyrianSensation,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:31:14 2015 UTC,He is looking like he will share in a large portion of the 143 targets getting passed down from Maclin leaving. If he gets 60 receptions in a PPR league out of those targets then he will have decent value in later rounds. Plus we already know he has after the catch explosiveness if he follows the usual punt/kick returner mentality.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Toughtimes4paco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that he seems over hyped. He got shut down by Josh Mitchell in their bowl game against Nebraska, and Mitchell is a mediocre corner at best."

Agholor is slated to be an outside guy with crisp route running ability and he's more explosive than Matthews.  Why wouldn't you expect success though?  They also added Bradford, and even still Sanchez was able to post good numbers for Matthews.   Expect him to have a good season akin to Matthews last year but more upside (since Matthews will assume the #1 WR role on the team from the gate).  Agholor will pick up quickly."

fantasyfootball,3dya93,nickiter,2,Tue Jul 21 03:49:49 2015 UTC,see maclin last year.
fantasyfootball,3dya93,donnylong,2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:13 2015 UTC,"Nelson Agholor played in a pro-style offense at USC, and going into the draft he was considered by many to be the 2nd most pro-ready receiver in the draft (after Amari Cooper). In short, he's not your typical rookie with rookie growing pains. In addition, those in the Agholor camp are projecting him to be Philadelphia's #1 WR on the outside, with Jordan Matthews (their most successful WR returning from last season) in the slot. Outside WR's tend to have higher upside than slot WR's due to big-play potential. If you add it all up, there's reason to believe he could be the best fantasy WR on the team that will run the most plays in the NFL this season. 6th-round might be a tad too high, but I'm guessing if you look at the WR's going around him at that time, Agholor's upside is as good or better than any."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,thefantasydraw,3,Tue Jul 21 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Nelson and Amari are the only 2 rookie WRs I feel comfortable rolling with as actual starters.   The only thing that matters in today's fantasy football is the player's ability to absorb the playbook and become an option on the most amount of plays possible.  Every single reputable thing I've heard about Nelson and Amari is that they are ready to step in and look like veterans.  I don't even care if there are guys out there who are better athletes, I need guys who can play right now. Of course Amari is also an insane athlete; Nelson is not. That makes Amari even better."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,smacksaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"He may or may not be good on a potentially good fantasy producing team that may or may not be run by Chip Kelly that may or may not have lost its top receiver.   Honestly though, he was a beast in college and has the potential to be a good NFL WR however, he is playing with some iffy QBs. If Bradford starts AND remains healthy, he could be a good late late round flyer."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,Simrik,0,Mon Jul 20 16:10:53 2015 UTC,"He likely gets 3rd looks after Matthews and Ertz, I just looked into and watched his highlights.

Those stats also don't reflect that Kessler was spreading the ball around between eight targets that game (Agholor also still scored a TD), or that USC's run game was completely ineffective (Buck Allen only got 31 yards on 15 carries). USC's defense did not stop the BC run game at all, and the game as a whole was just a disaster...  Source: USC alum, was in town for the game..."
fantasyfootball,3dya93,arctic92,-5,Mon Jul 20 18:54:04 2015 UTC,"He never did anything that impressive in college. I don't know where the hype is coming from, but it's mainly just because he went to usc and all trojans get over hyped."

fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,Zuunster,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Awesome!   Hey, does the keeper helper allow for draft pick calculations to collaborate with the missing draft picks that keepers take up? And does the first page reflect this by highlighting (blue line) your picks by removing keeper picks from that main sheet?  Example: If I had the 12th overall pick, but two keepers were selected in the 1st round before me, then the main sheet and the calculations would reflect such a change by highlighting in blue my new pick location. (which would be number 10)"
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,Zuunster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"So the draft pick odds calculation will not take this into account - this is something I've been meaning to look into, but honestly haven't spent the time to dig into the calculations and see what I can change.  Secondly, (I just tested it to see for myself). It does not take this into account either. Two very good points and I will look into changing some formulas up so it can better reflect this."
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,kiyobrown,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:47 2015 UTC,Cool. I've been looking at the sheet a ton this past week. I love it! Amazing work you've done. I truly appreciate it.
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,kiyobrown,2,Mon Jul 20 19:22:33 2015 UTC,"In the custom league setting section would you be able to have kick/punt return yards?  We do 1pt/25 pts kick and 1pt/10 pts punt return in our league. Not sure if it would adjust anything, though. It would be helpful in later rounds while considering someone like Harvin, Brian Quick, McCluster, etc.   Otherwise, great resource.

I see the league info and the league scoring sections but I'm not sure how they calculate and impact rankings. Thanks!
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,Clawless,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:22 2015 UTC,The ADP from FantasyFootballCalculator will adjust based on this (8-14teams either regular or PPR). The Point Projections VBD PC Gold formula It will also slightly affect the positional summary in the top right of the sheet   Those are all I can think of off the top of my head for the scoring aspect of it.   When you input the number of players per position for the league it will update the Team Summary page and organize the players as they are drafted according to their position.
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,DrKoooolAid,2,Mon Jul 20 20:20:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! What is and how does custom scoring impact the 'Custom Rank' column? What column(s) do you follow most closely when drafting and do you have any tips to you can pass on to maximize the usefulness of this form? Thanks a bunch for your work!
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,ya_mashinu_,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"My apologies, I didn't really elaborate as much as I should have on all the columns.  The Custom Rank column is just for you to enter in whatever ranks you want, they won't change unless you do so manually.  I try to keep an eye on the Expert Consensus Rankings (ECR) vs the players average draft position (the skew column helps with this) to try and see what players have the most value based on where they are being drafted.  BeerSheet value and adjusted beersheet value more-so are a very good indicator of which player has the most value at the current pick, this is another one I look at closely. PC Gold is a new one that's been shown to me this year, but their formula is pretty interesting and should provide similar results to that of BeerSheets and VBD. (for the best available players)  It's hard to say what will maximize the usefulness but if I had to pick one column to stick to it would be the adjusted beersheets value, in my opinion it takes into account your league settings the most accurately."
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,blackthrone,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:15 2015 UTC,I have an even bigger noob question: How do you select the picks in the live draftboard? Do you just type the player names into the corresponding pick cell?
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,blackthrone,2,Tue Jul 21 01:28:20 2015 UTC,Should have made that more clear sorry. You just enter the corresponding pick number next to the player name on the main tab then the draft board will auto update.
fantasyfootball,3dyl0q,weeeeeeetle96,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:07 2015 UTC,Got it. Any method for using it with an auction draft?
fantasyfootball,3e01sz,MikeRigz,10,Mon Jul 20 22:30:12 2015 UTC,Anyone else wouldve gone Alfred Morris there? I was surprised to see none of the experts pick him - after taking CJ Anderson in the first I'd want a low risk RB2.
fantasyfootball,3e01sz,Camawei,5,Mon Jul 20 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Hey Mike from GX here, I agree with your logic, but I think that rookie Matt Jones is a concern.

fantasyfootball,3e01sz,Camawei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:53:00 2015 UTC,Oh that's interesting. I dont follow much camp but I guess thats something I should pay attention to. What are your thoughts on Lamar Miller in that spot (with Ajayi in the picture)?
fantasyfootball,3e01sz,NervousPervis,2,Tue Jul 21 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"I had Miller last year and was planning on keeping him in this long time league, but I'm on the fence now. It seems like the coaching staff refuses to give Miller the love he deserves. Drafting Ajayi is a perfect example. He's a wait and see for me, but I could see Ajayi eating into Miller's workload a lot. There were drives last year that miller carried them, and then drives (that sputtered) that he wasn't on the field. Something is up -just my two cents"
fantasyfootball,3e01sz,Canesjags4life,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"Miller is a finesse back at the end of the day and just isn't built for a heavy workload on a per game basis. Last year he averaged 5.4 ypc on his first 10 carries and 2.5 ypc thereafter. The sample size is obviously small for his 11th carry on, but I think he loses effectiveness as the game goes on in a more significant way than most backs. I think that 13 carry per game range is perfect for him and it probably won't change much going forward. He'll be good. People just need to keep expectations in the high-end RB2 range. He isn't going to blow up like Bell did last year but I don't see any reason he can't replicate his output from 2014."

fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,joeyjojoeshabadoo,18,Tue Jul 21 02:39:50 2015 UTC,Just a heads up. /u/jayzheng created an awesome tool for help during your draft. Check it out here. I used it last year and it was a life saver. It uses player data from Fantasypros and Boris Chen's tiers. Won't be updated until Boris releases his tiers but I highly recommend using it during your draft.
fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,domel99,4,Mon Jul 20 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Used this tool during my draft as well, it's a great way to keep track."

fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,joeyjojoeshabadoo,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:39 2015 UTC,Yes. I messaged him on his Github page. He said he'll update it when he gets the data from Boris. I don't think it's very difficult for him to update. Just feed in a new data file.
fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,SushiRoe,2,Mon Jul 20 21:40:12 2015 UTC,This is great news! This tool combined with Boris' data is a godsend.
fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,de4170,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:59:56 2015 UTC,I used that draft aid last year as well--worked great.    This site has a similar web based drafting tool that is worth a look.
fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,joeyjojoeshabadoo,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:51 2015 UTC,Cool idea but there are some issues with the site. I can't switch from Standard to PPR or Half PPR.
fantasyfootball,3dyj3w,de4170,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me either. I assume it will be updated with those rankings at some point before the season. I sure hope so, because my 2 leagues are 1ppr and 0.5ppr!"

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,marzard,89,Mon Jul 20 15:38:07 2015 UTC,I think this might work better in an auction.  Drafting 1 WR in the first 6 rounds can really hurt your team
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"I always see it as there are dark horses at the WR position, but very few at RB. Very, very rarely do you see a RB you can actually start after drafting late or picking them up on the waiver wire, but there are usually at least 7-8 WRs you can pick up during the season or draft late that wind up being worthy to start."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Deigs,26,Mon Jul 20 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Ingraham, tre mason, forsett, Jeremy hill, Crowell, Ahmad Bradshaw, denard Robinson, latavius Murray, and CJ Anderson were all either late round picks or undrafted and became quality starters for a good stretch last season, if not longer.  RBs can be found just like WR can be.  Too much needs to happen for a handcuff to be worth a pick. It's not a risk I would personally take in the 5th or 6th round let alone both."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,8,Mon Jul 20 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but your post is misleading and makes false assumptions.     Bradshaw, Hill, Mason (probably an outlier) and Ingram were drafted in my slightly competitive 12 team league.  That means they cannot be ""found"" on waivers like WRs can. You're incorrect in assuming you can just pick up Mason/forsett/Robinson.  For every mason there was a Benny Cunningham, for forsett, Talifiaro/Pierce and for Robinson there was storm Johnson.  For cj there was Ball/hillman.  So it's not like RBs are just sitting there on waivers, winking at you.  The #40 RB scored 71 points.  The #40 WR Scored 100 points.  RBs that score are scarcer and harder to land than WR on waivers. That is why it pays to go RB heavy and why you can't just pick and choose them off of waivers as easily as WRs. I think this is mostly due to the pass happy NFL and the need for teams to be flexible in feeding multiple WRs to keep defenses honest."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Tacklegrapple,7,Mon Jul 20 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"Im not arguing WR are more valuable than RB.  Or that RB are easier to find.  I'm just saying that I wouldn't take a RB5 before taking a WR2, a QB1 and TE1.  So much has to happen to make that strategy be worth the pick.  For example, this strategy is to insure a team if the starter gets hurt.  So for CJ Spiller to be worth his 5th round pick, first Ingram needs to get hurt.  Then if he does get hurt, Spiller needs to be given the full workload from the Saints, which he has never done in his career.  Then if he somehow does get the total work load, he still needs to be better than your other WR you have assuming he'll be in your flex position behind Charles and Hill.  Too much needs to go right and thats not a chance I'm willing to take in the 5th round.  Also,  you start 3 WR compared to 2 RB.  So its not fair to compare the top 40 in each position.  The 40th WR is equivalent to the 27th ranked RB which scored 107 points last year."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,3,Mon Jul 20 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think the issue is the specific RB's the OP has chosen. Hill and Ingram have very expensive complementary back.  Ingram, his third round pick in this example, has his complement drafted in the fifth round. He is dedicating his 3rd and 5th round picks to one roster spot. He is also dedicating his 2nd and 6th round pick to one roster spot. Effectively through 6 rounds, he has drafted only 4 players. Sure, there might be a security blanket there in that you have injury accounted for, but a person who drafted six starters is going to have an advantage against someone with four starters and two bench players.  I think it's more effective to maybe look at players whose handcuffs or complements are less expensive. A player like Tevin Coleman comes into mind. You could draft Coleman and Freeman and have the Atlanta RB spot secure. Will Coleman be the bellcow that Ingram or Hill are? I'm not sure, but the cost is much less.  If you still want to go 5 RB in the first six rounds, I would look at avoiding spending your 5th and 6th round picks on handcuffs/complements to your 2nd and 3rd round picks and draft RBS from different offenses entirely, and then pick up all the low cost handcuffs you can in the later rounds. I would rather have 5 starting RBs with my first six picks with a chance of 1 or 2 getting hurt, than drafting 3 and 2 handcuffs/complements. It may be that you end up only getting 3 starting RBs no matter what you do, but i think it's better to diversify and have flexibility for match-ups and upside. The more starting quality players you have, you can make some more choices based on schedule and stuff."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,obbywanx,0,Tue Jul 21 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Well thank you for clarifying, because it sounded like you were arguing that WRs are as valuable as RBs (which, objectively, they are not).    To your clarified point, your CJ Spiller example is a bad one, only because CJ Spiller is not in a traditional first string, second string relationship with Ingram.  CJ Spiller will likely have a Darren Sproles role and will likely be at least a flex, even if Ingram does not go down with an injury.    Moreover, the WRs that are being drafted around the same time as Spiller are DeSean (questions mark for behavioral reasons), Kevin White (question mark rookie), Amari Cooper (question mark rookie), Andre Johnson (probably a better choice than Spiller), VJax (no questions mark, he blows now).  With the exception of Andre Johnson, I don't think it is at all clear who will have the better season.  Moreover, RBs are scarce!  That probably gives guys like Spiller an edge.     I'm not sure what your ""you start 3 WR to 2  RB"" point means, or why it is unfair to compare the top 40 in each position.  Please clarify."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Tacklegrapple,3,Mon Jul 20 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"OP said he wanted Spiller incase Ingram went down, Spiller would be the featured back and it would insure his Ingram pick.  I disagree with that.  My point with 3 WR and 2 RB is that what you start in most standard leagues, along with a flex, which I'm assuming this is.  So you start 1.5 times as many WR as RB.  Just like you start 3 times as many WR compared to QB or TE.  You wouldn't compare the 40th ranked WR to the 40 ranked QB right?  You have to look at it like the 12th ranked QB and TE, the 24th ranked RB and 36 ranked WR and the worst starting player at their position.  Say all things are equal, the 40th ranked WR is the 4 best ""bench"" WR. Whereas the 40th ranked RB is the 16th best ""bench"" RB. So the 40th WR will be somebodies 1st WR off the bench when the 40th ranked RB will be somebody 2nd RB off the bench"
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,0,Mon Jul 20 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"Frankly, that makes no sense to me.  Especially since I draft RB heavy and usually hit more than I miss."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Tacklegrapple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:55 2015 UTC,What exactly doesn't make sense?  Am I not being clear or do you not understand the concept?
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:38 2015 UTC,Your arbitrary opinion that a #40 RB is not comparable to a #40 WR.  That makes no sense to me because both positions can take up 3 spots in your starting line up.
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Tacklegrapple,0,Tue Jul 21 12:28:16 2015 UTC,"In most leagues you can start 3 RBs max if one is a flex. So your 5th and 6th round picks will spend most of the season on your bench. A 7th round receiver will be outscored by a 3rd or 4th round WR by quite a lot, not to mention the dropoff in QBs after rd 8 (12 man leagues). Take one handcuff in the later rounds, take players who will give your team points weekly in earlier rounds"
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,ItsTheWaxman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:27 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with /u/Lotto24 on this one. There's a few decent RBs that can be had on the waiver wire every year. As far as drafting a guy's handcuff I think round 5 and 6 is way too early to pull that trigger. Grab a couple receivers in that space. You can always handcuff these guys with RBs from other teams who aren't expected to break out, or a rookie. Melvin Gordon or Abdullah are good examples. L. Murray, Yeldon or Jennings/Vereen/Williams are all decent picks who will be around.    I drafted Tate one year to backup Foster and he rode my bench till week 10. Took up space on my roster plus I burned a pick on a guy who never had a chance of cracking my starting lineup.    And as you've stated, it's only worked 2/5 times right?"
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,welsman13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"I think the RBs OP mentioned are not traditional handcuffs.  Gio and Spiller will likely produce regardless and Davis is an RB1 if JC goes down.  That's why I think lotto is off the mark here.    Drafting handcuffs really only make sense with injury prone (high caliber) players (like your foster/tate eg, or if the cuff is a sure thing like Davis has been).  Im guessing you blew a pick on tate the year Foster was tweeting pics of his pulled hammy?  Remember, hindsight is always 20/20."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Tacklegrapple,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:14:44 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly Tre Mason was a hot draft pick last year?
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,iRussell21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:29:54 2015 UTC,No Stacy went into the season as the starter and was a 2nd/3rd round pick
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:37:33 2015 UTC,Ah you're right. I had the two confused. Thanks.
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,iRussell21,-6,Mon Jul 20 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"My point was that none of those guys, with maybe the exception of Ingram or Forsett, were players you were able to ride for a majority of the season. CJ had 4 games, Hill consistently was boom or bust until the last 3 games of the season, Bradshaw was the same way or hurt and was practically useless in standard, Denard/Murray/Mason were all start worthy for maybe 3 games. But guys like Manny Sanders, Jordan Matthews, Steve Smith, Mike Evans, Jeremy Maclin, DeAndre Hopkins, Julian Edelman, Kelvin Benjamin and OBJ were all guys that were being drafted in the 7-8th or later round, if at all, that you were able to have plugged in all season long."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Deigs,4,Mon Jul 20 17:35:40 2015 UTC,"So why not grab starting WR in rounds 5 and 6 and then take a chance on these other late round WR in hopes that they break out.  If they do and your starting RB gets hurt, you could use the breakout WR at flex.  Why waste two top 6 picks on two bench spots when you have no other positions filled.  You'll already be weak at QB and TE.  Why pass on WR too, just incase your RB gets injured?"
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Lotto24,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not at all saying this is a good idea, but the drop off from quality RBs to your average RB is without a doubt greater than the dropoff between receivers.    Source: won a championship by riding dark horse receivers after all my RBs/WRs were injured or suspended.  Getting 40+ combined pts every week from Sanders/Evans/Matthews helped a lot more than the 10-15 combined pts every week I was getting from the rotation of Denard/Crowell/Asiata/Martin  I'm all about taking Brown/Dez at the end of the 1st or Julio/Megatron/Jordy in the 2nd, but if I have a top 4-5 spot it's going into a quality RB that I know will perform over winding up with Murray and hoping things pan out with the Eagles or that McCoy works well in the Bill's offense or CJ/Hill continue to receive the volume they saw at the end of last season."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Deigs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:07:06 2015 UTC,"This much is true.   There is a huge swath of WRs in the 120-160 point range and when you average it out by week, the difference is nominal in a single matchup."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,smacksaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:22 2015 UTC,"That's where it comes down to how good you are at fantasy football, given thise waiver wire RBs you need to play the favorable matchups.  Your triple double strategy is fine, and its one I've used as well, but if an RB gets injured, you're not going to get the same production."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Smok3dSalmon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:15 2015 UTC,"always see it as there are dark horses at the WR position, but very few at RB.   Last season, guys who finished in the top 24 (startable 1s or 2s at their position) who were late round (8+) picks or undrafted:  RB: Forsett, Hill, Anderson, Ingram, Asiata, Ivory, A. Williams, Stewart, Tre Mason. If you include the top 32 (for flex considerations) you add 6 more RBs, a total of 15 and almost half the startable RBs.  WR: OBJ, Evans, Hopkins, Benjamin (barely, 8.01 ADP), S. Smith, LaFell, Boldin, Matthews. Including the top 32 you add 4 more for a total of 12.   The numbers are close but the difference says your point is exactly incorrect. It's easier to find a late round/undrafted startable RB than it is to find that in a WR. And that included a bunch of rookie WRs last year, an anomaly not likely to repeat itself. If anything you could say it's a toss up, but the numbers from last year say that it's harder to find that WR than RB."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,TooHappyFappy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"1) You forgot Lamar Miller.  2) There are always more viable WRs then there are running backs, so there is no way you would draft 5/6 WRs in the first rounds. 5/6 RBs is actually a half decent strategy if those are the best available players."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,vegasmel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:53 2015 UTC,"Miller had an ADP of 7.06 in 12 team standard leagues last year according to FFC.  To your second point, I wouldn't use either strategy. To take 5-6 RBs in the first 5-6 rounds would mean that you're not planning on starting at minimum 2 of those picks weekly. Yes injury/job loss happens but you're looking at immediately giving up 2 rounds of value to your bench guaranteed, unless you're drafting to trade which is usually a bad idea.  I don't even necessarily agree that there are more viable WRs than RBs. At the end of the season yes, there's more with the average ppg but most times that's filled with a slew of guys who have 3-4 20-30 point weeks then the rest are filled with 2-6 point weeks. While there are fewer of the mid-talent RBs and they may not score 15 points often, they get you a solid 7-9 per week. If you have studs at other positions that's all you really need out of the RB spot.  I just wouldn't include either 5 straight WRs or RBs in my draft strategy in the first 5 rounds. I'm more a fan of going RB-RB or WR-WR in the first two (if that's best available) then going 5 straight of the other position. You don't load up on a position where you've got stud talent and you give yourself options week-to-week at the less-stacked position."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,TooHappyFappy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:31 2015 UTC,"The difference to me is most of those RB's were waiver acquisitions.  The WRs, were mainly all drafted.  So that means you can actually make a conscious decision to get a WR, making it easier.  When it comes to the RBs, you have to play the waiver game. No one knew who the Ravens main back would be for the good month of the season making it hard to grab (and start) Forsett  However many people drafted guys like Evans, Hopkins, Benjamin hoping for a break out or old guys like S. Smith and Boldin as a safe or bye week fill in  Going by actual real life, its alot harder to find those WW Rbs than it is to just draft late serviceable/boom WRs"
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,jesterx7769,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"If you include the top 32    There are 32 teams in the NFL, of course there's a ton in the top 32 that were drafted late, if at all. If you include the top 100 I'm sure there's even more RBs drafted later than the 7th round that I'm not trusting on my starting roster."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Deigs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"I'm talking top 32 in terms of fantasy points scored, not that are on NFL teams."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,TooHappyFappy,0,Mon Jul 20 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"I know and I'm saying that top 32 is quite a large number to be throwing names into. I could tell you the top 50 most visited states in the US, do you know which ones are included? All of them.   Outside of the top 15-20 RBs, I don't think I would consistently rely on any of them week to week."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Deigs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"In a 12-team fantasy league with a flex, most leagues would start 24-36 RBs. So 32 as a benchmark for identifying the total number of RBs that have high value is certainly reasonable.  As to your point about a majority of RBs being drafted 8th round or later due to sheer quantity of players and teams, there were 34 RBs drafted before the 8th round (so theoretically every team's starter), so I think your criticism in that case is not valid."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,bkervick,64,Mon Jul 20 21:02:37 2015 UTC,"You're doing it wrong.  Taking Ingram and Hill requires you to take handcuffs that are being drafted too high.    Stick with Foster, Anderson (with Ball, not Hillman), Murray, Charles, Ellington (Johnson), Morris (Jones), Miller (Ayaji) Peterson (McKinnon).  These guys' handcuffs can be taken late, so you don't have to burn up mid rounders for Spiller and Gio, allowing you to have a much better overall team."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,sexytoddlers,12,Mon Jul 20 16:43:12 2015 UTC,"I agree.  You don't want to pick a guy who's handcuff must be drafted 2 rounds later.  Also, the format above is giving you your wr1 in 4th round and wr2 in 7th round (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th RB picks).  5 rbs in first 7 rounds is overkill.  You would need more balance.  Jamaal and Knile are locked in RB1's (Knile if Jamaal goes down).  Knile proved he's a beast when given the chance last year.  I'd put them at the top of the list.  I'm targetting Knile regardless."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Storm_Johnson,6,Mon Jul 20 17:09:32 2015 UTC,"For this guys plan to work out, he needs his top 2 picks to go down with injuries and get at least 1 awesome receiver from waivers. These aren't even handcuffs he's taking, they're legit RBBC's. I just don't get this at all."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Avelek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:46:10 2015 UTC,"I went 5 RBs in the first 7 last year with PFM in the first and made the final.  Anecdotal I know, but I love loading up on RB (if 2 of them hadn't been Toby Gerhart and Ray Rice I may have won the final).  But the problem here is that he's using 5 of his first 7 picks on a total number of 3 possible starters.  No matter what happens he has at most 3 viable starters.  I don't have a problem with drafting 5 shots at starters at RB in the first 7 rounds.  If you get three starters, fine.  If you get 4, then great; you can trade or at least cover bye weeks easily.  If you get lucky and get 5 starters (combo of RB1, RB2s, and high-end flexes), then you have some great trade bait, because you are also creating scarcity by hoarding all that talent.  I know you don't draft players with the intention of trading them, but I value RBs higher than other positions, and if I have two WRs I feel comfortable with, then I have no problem going 6,7, or 8 RBs in the first 10 rounds if they are ranked highest on my board.  (Eight might be an exaggeration).  I think his strategy is a little more viable in an auction where you know exactly what you are paying for a guy."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Guido420,2,Tue Jul 21 02:29:10 2015 UTC,requires you to take handcuffs that are being drafted too high.   The players OP suggested aren't handcuffs in the traditional sense. As he described they are:    above average backup as a handcuff/flex play.   It's not inconceivable that Ingram and Spiller or Hill and Gio could both be worthy starters with the potential of being superstars if their counterpart gets hurt.
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,chiraz25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:25:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree with it then. If you have Gio and Hill you are setting yourself up for frustration.  And even moreso with Ingram and Spiller.  This is exactly the opposite of what you want to do in a draft. You'll be flipping a coin every week with these tandems. Get them off waivers/trade, sure. But wasting all your top picks to grab a shared backfield seems highly damaging to your team.  Knile and Jamaal, def ok though."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,machinegunke11y,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:52 2015 UTC,Great point. Plus Spiller and Gio will cut into their respective starters carries and catches even if they're healthy.  Guys like Foster and Miller are more true cowbell RBs

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,sweatybronson,13,Mon Jul 20 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"In a standard non PPR league, Gio at 6.10 is a big reach, as is Knile at 10.10.   There might be some benefits to this strategy, but IMO the opportunity cost is way way too high.  The chances of a guy like Charles, Hill, or Ingram busting is rather minimal anyways."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Avelek,7,Mon Jul 20 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"I think with the way running backs are rotated nowadays the concept of a handcuff is a bit outdated. We saw multiple times last year a starting RB go down and the #2 guy on the depth chart get skipped. I'd much rather draft a guy with more upside and get a stud receiver instead of a backup running back who ideally I'll never play.  Plus Jeremy Hill and Ingram aren't workhorse backs in my mind. Gio Bernard is an electric talent who demands touches, Ingram gets injured every year and has arguably a more talented back behind him.   Charles/Foster are the only backs I think that are worth handcuffing. They're a little bit older, both get dinged up a bit and have good backups with low ADPs, but not too good that they're going to take away carries."

My RB1 will something like a Gore, ingram, Lamar Miller, Hyde, Ellington in the 3rd or 4th.  I can than target Crowell, Mason, Ivory, Matthews, Duke Johnson, David Johnson, Sankey/David Cobb, Reggie Bush In the 7th 8th round.   You would be able to start an RB of Ellington, Crowell, and the Tennessee RB or something similar. That would be a 3rd and 7th,8th,9th 10th picks. You could adapt this with another better RB earlier or start a 3rd WR at the flex depending how your draft goes."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Dessy44,2,Mon Jul 20 21:56:01 2015 UTC,Well the Saints are not a running team no matter what you hear. No RB has rushed for 1200 yards since Deuce McAllister did it. Plus you'll never play both RBs in the same week so that's not a great strategy
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,machinegunke11y,2,Mon Jul 20 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"I think a better strat is to look at those teams with game-scripts, coaches, and OL's conducive to big rushing numbers, but that don't have a ton of clarity yet.  Teams where you don't know who the guy is gonna be come mid-season, but where you know whoever it is is gonna have solid numbers.  You also need a reasonable expectation thay it won't turn into an RBBC.  My reason is that you can spend middle/late picks locking up these backfields and potentially get RB1's.  For me its:   Gurley/Mason - Jeff Fisher usually picks one guy and rides him Crowell/Johnson - excellent OL, terrible weapons in the passing game; might run 40 times per game Randle/McFadden - Elite OL, either player is a risk to miss time, which helps the other guy (McFadden because of injury, Randle because he's a bonehead).  Seriously doubt Dunbar will get more than change-of-pace work even if one of the other guys go down. And perhaps Murray/Matthews (though you have to draft them a little higher) - fast-paced offense means both get lots of opportunity.  Are said to be much better fits than McCoy, and both are injury risks, which as above reduces the risk of committee."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Wisefool157,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, for how I like to play, it ties up too many roster spots for limited upside. There are too many examples of handcuffing just not working (either the backup is a surprise choice, or the backup is RBBC). If I know I'm taking 5 RB's with my first 6 picks, I'd rather use that to swing for the fences with risky guys who could pay off big: think Joseph Randle, Ameer Abdulah, and (coincidentally) CJ Spiller.  I typically only handcuff in 16-team leagues, leagues with deep benches, or in very specific circumstances (like Murray-Randle or Charles-Davis last season). In a 12-team, 15-man roster league, you should have enough depth that you don't need 3 handcuffs. I find the concept of handcuffing to be one of the most overrated strategies in FF, and tying up 3 spots for handcuffs is likely to hurt you more when it comes to roster flexibility and picking up spec players during the season.  I don't mean to slam your idea, but it's just my 2 cents. As far as using 5 of the first 6 picks on RB's, that might actually be viable this year. The mid tier of WR's is huge, and it's reasonable to like the WR's going in the 9th-11th round just as much as the WR's going in the 5th-6th."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,plegronease,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"An okay strategy, perhaps, but I think using the Bengals and Saints puts you at a disadvantage because you're spending pretty high draft picks on backups since Spiller and Bernard have value out of the gate.   If you were to do this, I'd say use the Chiefs, Texans, and Eagles or Broncos... Because you can get their handcuffs for cheap so you won't be killing yourself at WR.   Oh, and pretty sure that Montee Ball is the handcuff to CJ, not hill-man."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Wisefool157,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"I think this strategy is seriously flawed and leaves you with both an unproductive bench and fairly poor WR choices (relative to the rest of the league).  Of course, we don't know your scoring rules.  If this is a standard (non-PPR) league, I don't mind stockpiling those first three RBs you listed.  After that, I would be focusing on ONE of the handcuffs, by taking all three you are wasting two very valuable draft slots and bench positions."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,MANPAD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:35:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think Ingram is a bellcow. More on that later. Anyway...  I usually do that because I'm more about a high floor and low ceiling. I just want to seed my team with baseline points and RBs have more touches and opportunities for incremental scoring.  I've done three auctions this year and went RB heavy. If you're going to do it, this is what it looks like at auction:  Team 1  QB: Brees/Rivers, RB: Leveon/Charles/Demarco/Coleman/Freeman, WR: Maclin/Andre Johnson/Cruz/Steve Smith/Wallace, TE: Delanie  Team 2  QB: Big Ben/Bradford, RB: AP/Leveon/Demarco/Crowell/Denard, WR: Maclin/Tate/Steve Smith/Davante/Moncrief, TE: Delanie  Team 3  QB: Big Ben/Rivers/Eli, RB: Leveon/Lacy/Charles, WR: Maclin/Baldwin/Steve Smith/Davante/Moncrief, TE: Olsen/Kelce/Cameron  Meaning you have to take what the league gives you. I targeted WRs who would also get consistent points with a low ceiling, but very high floor along with some rookies who have a chance to bust out.  In snake drafts it's a bit more difficult. You have to take what the draft gives you. It's not always possible. But in an auction, it is.  It's worth mentioning that the last time I had triple RBs was the year AP got hurt and it was hard to recover from. It's truly putting all of your eggs in one basket. And you have to have assets to deal.   Ingram isn't like Charles or Lacy where he will rarely be taken out. Spiller and Khiry both bring different things to the table than Ingram and will get use."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,jesterx7769,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Using 5 of your top 6 picks on RBs seems like a bad idea since you can only start 3 RBs in most leagues.  I generally try to fill out my starting lineup before drafting backups.  Early round WRs can be worth as much or more than the RBs going around the same time.  Plus the top WRs tend to be relatively safe picks.  Getting stud RBs early and getting their handcuffs late is generally a good idea, but when you have to spend 5th and 6th round picks for handcuffs it isn't good value imo."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,potzdamn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Handcuffs are a waste of a pick imo. loading your roster with them is such a disadvantage when you could get a starter at rb for the same price or a rookie that could emerge. The only one truly worth rostering is knile davis cause hes actually shown he can be a beast when he starts. people like spiller and gio are not handcuffs imo because their backfields were time shares in the first place and will probably continue to be even with injury to the ""Starter""."

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,stasema,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:16 2015 UTC,"hindsight is 20/20. jeremey hill went in the eighth round last year because he did have upside as the backfield was expected to be a timeshare. That is not the price of a handcuff imo. knile would have been decent to handcuff with cause he went cheap and charles has been injured in the past, but there was no way of knowing if the replacement in either of those situations was actually going to be a success. In most cases a handcuff is not going to be able to reproduce what your starter was doing for you anyway. Handcuff worth is also dependent on injury which is not something you should bet on in fantasy. If the player does not get injured then you just wasted a roster spot over a potential value pick."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,JLPphoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that if Hill or Ingram get hurt, the backfield is still going to be a committee with Gio and Spiller being complimentary/passing down backs. They won't be promoted to bellcow running backs in an injury.   Handcuffs in general are a waste of a pick anyway, you should be investing in those players for their productivity as starters that early in the draft."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,spartynole4life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:18 2015 UTC,"I think purposefully hand cuffing is a waste of a pick, especially early on.  In this example  you are fore fitting your 5th and 6th pick which are only useful if you 2nd and 3rd round pick fail.  Safety net? Sure.  However if your second and third round pick work, at least for majority of season, you have wasted two out of your top six picks.

fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,Newm4n,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"This is the strategy I have used in nearly every draft across 12 leagues for 5 years. Unless of course some insane value drops to you (Rogers late in the second, Antonio brown in the 3rd etc)  It is great, and I am almost always in the playoffs with every team. Hog up a plethora of backs, laugh as everyone else is scrambling for bilal Powell. Can never go wrong with rb/rb as an opener. Often times rb/rb/rb is good if the tiers justify it."
fantasyfootball,3dyfmr,darealdarvinham,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:29:00 2015 UTC,"Benefits:   You likely end up with the top RB core in your entire league. Very safe, makes you huge at the biggest position in fantasy football   Downfalls:   You're only starting 4 of your top 7 picks at a time, you lose lots of value there When the starter gets injured, you lose a fraction of the current week (e.g. if he gets injured 1st quarter). In a strategy based around injury insurance, this is suboptimal. It's rarely a smooth transition from starter to backup. Unless they just say mid-week: ""Charles broke a leg in practice, Knile gets all the touches Sunday"", you will have some awkward weeks While you can salvage at QB/TE, your WRs will need some serious luck to be above average Also, now 3 of your bench slots are cuffs. That means 3 fewer sleepers and/or competent substitution options You would have to reach hard to ensure you get all 6 players   If I knew that I could reliably land this ""triple-double"", I'd love a shot at having that kind of RB strength. But unless you luck into some dynamite WR in round 4/7, I see it being really hard to take a championship with this draft"

Last year though, I ended up hanging onto the Ravens as a backup/keep for the playoffs and streamed another defense every week, provided I could get someone better as per the weekly defense posts here. I did this because there were two teams in my league hoarding 2-3 defenses. Other teams sometimes would hang on to defenses that played teams like the Bucs or Jags that next week, or two weeks in advance.  All this to say, it'll probably end up that way in a 14 man. People will be vying for the teams defenses who play a weak team that next week or two. I'd highly recommend finding one solid team that is above average. Even if they're playing teams like Green Bay or the Colts or something, when they have a decent matchup, even if they aren't in the top 5 for defenses that week, they usually fair pretty well so long as they're top 10-12, which can be difficult even to come by if you're streaming in a 14 man.   Especially once you consider that probably around 10 teams have defenses you wouldn't touch with a 50 foot pole any week of the year.

fantasyfootball,3e03ek,MF_Mood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:30 2015 UTC,"Streaming is good (won my 14 fam league doing it)  but be sure to keep track of team stretches down the road, find the best time to pick one up.  Even if that means picking them up during a bye week and burning a bench spot.  I think during playoff weeks I stopped swapping and ended up having 2-3 teams that I stuck with and rotated that helped me out greatly.  All performed solid and my opponents couldn't pick them up.  If other teams are stuck with a crap D it can greatly swing the odds in your favor, which is critical in playoffs and very satisfying as well.  If you league takes itself serious though I can't imagine it'll be as easy, teams will be looking at similar teams/matchups week to week and guys willing to burn fa roster spots for those advantages."
fantasyfootball,3e03ek,Chasedabigbase,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:24:59 2015 UTC,Any Given Sunday my friend....play the matchup you like...don't worry about holding on to 2 DEF or drafting the Texans or Bills....if anything there will be a DEF that surprises everyone and you can try to hold onto them
fantasyfootball,3e03ek,keithyp24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:57 2015 UTC,"I did it last year and it worked out fine, but I've had the benefit of being in a lax league where they ride or die with the defense they drafted except during Bye Week.  Only a few other teams even bothered switching out for a week if a better matchup was available, and I think I was the only one who planned weeks ahead.  I have to assume it's a little trickier to effectively pull off in a league of 14 competent individuals."

fantasyfootball,3dy9ig,HowYaGuysDoin,3,Mon Jul 20 17:57:10 2015 UTC,Fantasy Pros free sim is good for the first 3 rounds. I see TEs go way too quickly in that sim though.

fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,ReeceChops44,5,Mon Jul 20 18:47:42 2015 UTC,"I've done several mocks and have been able to snag one of the following D/ST's in the 14th round (14 team) in various draft spots. I don't have any fancy algorithm behind it, just eyeballing based on first 4 games:  Miami, Carolina, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Indianapolis.  They all have pretty tame looking first 4 games, even Cleveland starts off against the Jets, Titans, and Raiders. I'll try streaming from there."
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,KoalaExpress,3,Mon Jul 20 20:50:42 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the same list I have. To the credit of OP, Miami is #1 on my list, but not by enough to reach."
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,thefantasydraw,14,Mon Jul 20 22:23:42 2015 UTC,"Well I assume that MIA will be one of his top picks for Week 1 streaming. I assume his formula is similar to mine and I have them near the top for Week 1, so he'll probably tell you to start them.  If you want to ride them, do it. I'm actually semi-keeping them myself.  Their schedule to open is very favourable: WAS, JAX, BUF, NYJ, TEN and HOU before having to face NE.  In each of those pre-NE matchups there are plenty of opportunities for sacks, low-scoring games, INTs or a combination of those things.  Miami should be no worse than one of the top DSTs each week until they face NE. If you look at their schedule, I'm not sure I want to finish with them, but I'm more than happy to start with them.   If you figure that streaming rankings are based on expected points for things that are likely to happen (Sk, INT, PtsA), all of those teams are very good odds to pay out.  I won't be surprised if Miami has 60 points through Week 7."
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,smacksaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"The way I see it you could ride them exclusively the first six weeks, keep them for the next six while making sure you have something to swap if for them in their rough weeks, and drop them week 13 and on. I'm a big fan of streaming but I think that's what my plan is for this year."
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,AllDaveAllDay,4,Tue Jul 21 04:20:46 2015 UTC,"When evaluating D I only look at the first 4 weeks of the season. Not only do I want to leave myself open to streaming, there is also so much change from year to year that after 4 weeks we are going to rank defenses quite different than we did preseason.  That said, Miami is easily in my top-5 D's for the first 4 games of the season, but there are a couple in my top-5 that should be much easier to grab in the 13th or 14th round (of a 15 round draft). So there's not much incentive to reach above the 13th round IMO. Maybe if my Top-5 D's were all popular picks, but they aren't."

fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,thefantasydraw,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:02 2015 UTC,"I like Miami this year and will try to pick them up.

fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,tobiasmugridge,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:19 2015 UTC,I'd put them at a solid second to last round pick. Just before I draft a kicker.

fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,lookallama,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:33 2015 UTC,According to fantasypros.com they're the 12th defense taken on average at pick 159. So if you really want them get them in the 3rd to last round.  In an auction bid 2 because no one will probably pay 3 dollars for them.
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,amc111,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:47 2015 UTC,"I know you mentioned it, but outside of perhaps the top defense, I don't really see an advantage of picking one up before the last round. You've got a much better chance striking it big on another WR later in the draft."
fantasyfootball,3dz4p0,srs0001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"If you like Miami, I say pick'em in the second or third to last. By that point you're probably only competing against kickers, Seattle D and the bottom of the barrel players.  I'd hesitate to pick much earlier than that. Defenses as a whole are pretty interchangeable (The old ""who's playing Jacksonville this week?"") Personally, I would rather stumble upon a gem flex or backup RB than move up for a defense."

fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,Tomoromo9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:08 2015 UTC,I can't say I've looked closely but I don't think there was any significant difference between his stats with Palmer and his stats with the top backup (whose name I somehow forgot).

fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,fytfootball,4,Mon Jul 20 19:01:39 2015 UTC,Last years stats:  Fitz 63/840/2  Floyd 47/780/6  Brown 48/700/5

fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,fytfootball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:26:08 2015 UTC,I just took a long look at the stats and Fitz is by far the most productive with Palmer at QB.   Last year in 0.5 PPR under Palmer vs (average with a QB other than Palmer)   Fitz 12.5  (7.2)  Brown 9.5 (7.4)  Floyd 7.3 (8.4)
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,Tomoromo9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"It's definitely good to note, but I'm not drafting based on a sample size of the 6 games Palmer played. Obviously all of them are better with Palmer. Fitz's athletic ability is in decline while the young guys are [theoretically] improving. Like I said, I don't want any of them, but if I had to make a speculative pick it would probably be Brown.  Floyd seemed like he was gonna be the guy last year but he fucked up a couple big play opportunities and he might have missed his chance."

fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,JoeScoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:52:50 2015 UTC,"These are very late round picks, at least in the mocks I have done. It is very unlikely those picks would remain on your team throughout the year."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,LandofBoz88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt that happens, Palmer was a top 10 QB before going down last year. It is more likely that one becomes the main target on offense, and you drop the other two."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,LandofBoz88,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since he's had a season with over 1000 yards, and Palmer is injury prone. If palmer player 16 games fitz could be a low WR2, but that's at  best."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,BenjaminStanklin,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:57 2015 UTC,Not really. He had just under 1000 yards in 2013 and could have had more yards if not for 2nd or 3nd string QBs running the team last year
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,BenjaminStanklin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:20 2015 UTC,"The last season where he went over 1000 yards was 2011. Not to snub his 2013 season, which was good in its own right. He has value but he's far from trending up - both him and Palmer are up there in age and Palmer's coming off a re-torn ACL. I can see him putting up a couple good games this season, but it'll be a crapshoot to figure out when those games will be. His value this year lies in how late he is going and I happen to be higher on him than most."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,odellbeckham13,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:16 2015 UTC,I think his skills have done somewhere. He's just not as good as he once was. I think u could argue he's the 3rd best WR on that team
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,borgidiom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it has anything to do with skills he catches everything that is thrown to him. More to do with how they run their offense down there.
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,bentriple,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:42 2015 UTC,"With Carson in the lineup, Fitz had three good games last year. He scored two TD's the entire year. It's not worth it to have him as your WR2 when he's getting older and way less reliable"
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,Tomoromo9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:18 2015 UTC,Fitz' point totals during Palmer last year (0.5 PPR)   Week 1 - 2.5  Week 6 - 18  Week 7 - 4  Week 8 - 25.5  Week 9 - 9.5  Week 10 - 15.5  Pretty impressive.  12.5 average.  If he could have extended that average all season with Palmer he would have been the #13 fantasy WR
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,panchojulio,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:05 2015 UTC,"He isn't as good anymore.  His yards are down, 2 of the past 3 seasons have had poor td totals, and his ceiling isn't more than a low end wr2."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,panchojulio,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but more importantly he had 784 and 2 last year.  He isn't anywhere near the gamechanger he used to be, even if he does still have great hands and solid route running."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,just_trizzy,7,Mon Jul 20 18:56:54 2015 UTC,"His stats could be misleading, he was drastically better when Palmer was healthy.   Games w/Palmer:  6/98/1  2/21/0  7/160/1  5/70/0  9/112/0  If Palmer stays healthy Fitz will do much better than last season. He could be a sleeper cheap low-end WR1 high end WR2. Buying him at his current ADP is buying him at his floor, not his cieling."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,just_trizzy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought. He was good when Carson was there. Now that Carson not even thinking about the knee, he very likely will outperform his ADP"

fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,jjfreshhh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:15 2015 UTC,His ball catching ability is still as good as ever but he's definitely lost some speed. John Brown will be the best fantasy WR on Arizona because he's a deep threat while Fitzgerald isn't so much. I also think it's a toss up between Michael Floyd and Fitz for who scores more fantasy points. I'm a Cardinals fan and will definitely draft Brown Fitz or Palmer.
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,love_pho,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:51 2015 UTC,"I kind of think he's being undervalued, but not by much. His skills aren't gone, but it's hard to imagine he'll just bounce back randomly this season. If he's still available I'll pick him up in a late round"
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,halfman-halfshark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:31 2015 UTC,"When Fitz was good, he was the main if not he only option on the team.  (Yes, he had Boldin, but that's not part of this coversation.)  At that time, Whisenhunt was coach, and not being an idiot, he basically had them try to force the ball in Fitz's hands every chance they got.    That was years ago, Fitz is aging and a step or two slower, and they have more (younger, faster) options now.  So, he'll never probably never have a thousand yard season again.   I'd expect maybe 500-600 yards and four touchdowns from him at best."
fantasyfootball,3dyv3t,Tomoromo9,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"I think you are right.   For a couple years it was assumed that Fitzgerald was still the Fitzgerald who played with Kurt Warner in the Super Bowl, but was screwed by epicly bad quarterbacks.  Now it is clear he has lost a step, but his 10 touchdowns in 2013 still made him a solid WR2.  I see no reason he can't do that again, and at his current ADP of 102 that is a steal."

The way the Cards offense is set up allows Carson to spread the ball around to the open guy. Just because he doesn't spam Fitz with the ball, doesn't mean that ""he's been pretty bad."" He is still a top notch receiver with elite hands. Also, it's hard to get Larry the ball when you play with backup QBs for half the year."

fantasyfootball,3dyut9,gimpisgawd,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:40 2015 UTC,For ESPN they make it so no matter what your keeper costs a first. It's stupid but yeah either offline or move to another site.
fantasyfootball,3dyut9,waitingforduffman,4,Mon Jul 20 17:42:24 2015 UTC,Or move to an auction format. On ESPN keeper costs can be deducted from an auction budget pre-draft.
fantasyfootball,3dyut9,wordsfilltheair,5,Mon Jul 20 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"My league uses ESPN and have keepers in various rounds. It just requires a bit more work from the commissioner if you don't want to switch sites. Just compile a spreadsheet of players that can't be drafted and the rounds they are taken in. Everybody is expected to pay attention to the players to minimize the number of times a prohibited player is taken. If someone does take one, the commish can roll the pick back and let them pick again. In the three years we've been doing it, only a handful of times has a player been picked and it was solved instantly. We also added I think 30 seconds per pick to make sure people have time to check if the player they want is being kept, but that extra time is rarely utilized. Again, not as easy as setting and forgetting, but it is possible."
fantasyfootball,3dyut9,pleasehelpplz,3,Mon Jul 20 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"In our league, ESPN, we do a keeper league, so this is what we do. So i have OBJ as my 15th round keeper, no one can draft him except for me in the 15th round. Another example, some kid in my league is keeping Latavius Murray, he was drafted 17th round. No one else can take him except for the one person who drafts him 17th round."

My league switched to Clickydraft last season and paid for it out of the winnings pool. It worked just fine. Before that, ESPN drafts were a shit show with the commish checking a master list of keepers every round to make sure people didn't draft someone else's player and took their guy when they were supposed to.

fantasyfootball,3dztkm,sfhood,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:46 2015 UTC,"And you are 100% right about that. PPR is so stupid. There is no inherent benefit to a reception and the easiest ones to get are the ones that help your team the least. First downs, there is always benefit to those."
fantasyfootball,3dztkm,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"It's way harder to predict how many 1st downs a player is going to get versus how many receptions.

fantasyfootball,3dztkm,qubat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"Understandable. We look at it as a ""point for."" It may be more difficult to predict player value before the draft but it is more accurate in assessing the player's actual value during games."
fantasyfootball,3dztkm,sfhood,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"I can confirm /u/ManlyBoltzmann about everything he said about PPFD. As for bonuses, Yahoo can only do bonus points for 40+ yard playes (passing, rushing, receiving). You can't customize the amount of yards for a play-bonus; it's set to 40+.

I've also never seen a tie using fractional scoring, and if you are a red-blooded American you know ties suck."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,thefantasydraw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:39 2015 UTC,Yes change you league to a 1 point PPR league they are lot better and they give players more valuable and the scoring is more consistent.

fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,Spartan8585,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:23 2015 UTC,I'm a big fan of positional scoring PPR for larger leagues (12 or more).  0.5 RB/1.0 WR/1.5 TE  I also advocate strongly for -1 for QB sacked and fumbles lost should be the same as your penalty for INT.  Eliminate the kicker.
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:13:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, all that matters to me is that it makes the games even more exciting to watch. Hell, I'm in two leagues where for QBs, we do 6 pt TDs, -.25 pt Incompletions and 1 pt completions. To ""balance"" the positions we do 1 pt receptions, and .333 pt rushing attempts. It's IDP too.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's a ton of fun watching your guys when they get points for so many things. And the drafts are crazy fun, because there are so many different strategies."

fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,rashasha2112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"That system might've been good back in 2003 time frame when the article was posted, but the game has evolved quite a bit since then.  That system would boost TEs WAY too much and gimp RBs quite a bit.  Doing a quick stat for the top 30 players in RB/WR/TE in non-PPR, not including fumbles, that system in 2014 would yield:   3 TEs with 400+ points, 6 TEs with 300+ points, and 10 TEs with 200+ points. 1 RB with 300+ points, 6 RBs with 200+ points 4 WR with 300+ points, 23 WRs with 200+ points   The top 10 goes in order: Gronk (460.8), Graham (407.8), Olsen (405.6), Bennett (399.2), Brown (378.1), Gates (374.2), D. Thomas (338.9), Kelce (336.4), Walker (328), Nelson (327.9).  DeMarco Murray would be in 13th and Le'Veon Bell would be 20th overall.  There would be 8 TEs that would score higher than Murray.  TE12 would be Ertz at 23 overall."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,chinaman1472,0,Mon Jul 20 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"True, but the core principal to have an equivalence of value across the skill positions still stands.  The league I run started with this, then reduced the points per catch for TEs to one point and we're implementing a full ppr for RBs this year (up from .5 ppr).  I believe we tweaked the DEF points a bit to offset the higher offensive outputs of the modern NFL.  Each year I average out the prior 3 years' stats and verify that the equivalence of value is still there. If something is out of whack, we make a tweak to our scoring system... and it remains perfect."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,rashasha2112,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"Sure, equivalence is important I agree, but not telling the OP any more doesn't help him.    Just running the numbers on receptions, yards, and TDs, I don't see how you can keep 1 yard = 0.2 points for TEs and not skew it at the top heavily in favor of TEs.  Even if you dock it down to 1PPR for TEs, they're still outscoring WRs and RBs at the top and things like fumbles and 2 point conversions aren't going to make up for it.  TEs dominate the top of the skill positions and it's not even close.  I'm one for equivalence, but production and impact should still be a part of equation IMO."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,chinaman1472,0,Tue Jul 21 01:24:18 2015 UTC,"12 team, 0.5 ppr, 2 flex, 6 pt TDs, fractional scoring, the ultimate FF scoring.  And none of that IDP nonsense.  All purely opinion based on my FF experience."

fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,cheerio93,3,Mon Jul 20 14:26:20 2015 UTC,This is not true. There was just a post the other day.   https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3dsmk8/exactly_how_much_does_6ptpass_td_versus_4ppptd/  6 pt per TD does not change the scarcity of QBs. So while yes the QB position as a whole produces more points the differences in the value of a #1 QB to the #10 is not much of difference compared to a 4pt TD league.
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,WhoYourSister,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:42 2015 UTC,Agreed. We also award .5 PPC (point per completion). This way QB's are where they should be in the draft IMO.

I want it to be a fair fight, not a crapshoot at drafting Andrew Luck."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,FredFlanders,0,Mon Jul 20 20:08:16 2015 UTC,"General consensus seems to be 0.5 PPR is ideal. I think the QB pts per TDs is still up fro debate. Personally I like 6 pt TDs, with -3 pt INTs. Adds a bit more variance to a rather homogenous position.  Never been a fan of IDPs. Probably never will. Just too few distinct, meaningful stats."
fantasyfootball,3dy5mz,qp0n,0,Mon Jul 20 15:39:25 2015 UTC,I'm a fan of 1 PPR and 6pt Passing TDs. I feel like it makes fantasy less based on luck. Standard scoring just seems too TD dependant for my liking. I also like 0.1 PPC.   I hate IDP though.

fantasyfootball,3dzz5i,jesterx7769,3,Mon Jul 20 22:29:57 2015 UTC,"Really this just illustrates the importance of being able to change draft strategies and go with the flow of each individual draft. I like this team, a lot... but this draft wasn't the result of a perfect strategy. It's the result of the perfect strategy meeting the perfect draft.  Antonio Brown (1.12), Alshon Jeffery (3.12), and Randle Cobb (4.01) were all steal picks that you had no business drafting at those spots. Even Joseph Randle (5.12) is a great value. Crazy things happen like this in drafts all the time, but 9 out of 10 times you aren't going to have that kind of WR value handed to you.  I don't like that you reached for a kicker, otherwise your bench could be even better, and if given a choice I wouldn't want a defense facing the Colts and Patriots in weeks 1-2. But I'd be surprised if any team in this draft came out better than this."
fantasyfootball,3dzz5i,thefantasydraw,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:24 2015 UTC,I;m willing to reach on a kicker a round early just to have the #1 because a kicker will win some matchups and I was still able to get the other people I wanted because after I took a kicker it began a run on them along with defenses which i've noticed happens in many drafts
fantasyfootball,3dzz5i,thefantasydraw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:57 2015 UTC,"If it's only one round, I can accept it. I see Gotskowski go a lot in the 10th or 11th, so I thought maybe you reached that far. I like your reasoning though, pick a K or D right before the run starts and you get first dibs on the K's or D and still get the same bench guy."
fantasyfootball,3dzz5i,JerryvillePop0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:02 2015 UTC,Yea I ran through several mock drafts and noticed the same trend if you go kicker or defense in the 14th everyone follows suit then you can go out and get your last bench player

fantasyfootball,3dzz5i,LiamHundley,2,Mon Jul 20 22:34:30 2015 UTC,Try to get a late pick. 9th or 10th in a ten team league is perfect. Dez and Julio is optimal. Julio and OBJ is great too. With the late picks you get to pick in pairs which I love. My next pair of picks are Jimmy Graham and the best WR on the board. Sanders usually. Then I take about 4 RBs and hope they pop. Basically WR heavy with Jimmy Graham in the 3rd. If he's gone then it's another WR 3rd round

fantasyfootball,3e15pn,Drizzy_THAkid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:06 2015 UTC,If there is someone with an ADP of 7 but you want the one with ADP 17 I would probably take the ADP 7 player because you could potentially trade him for the guy you want and then some. Plus if the person has an earlier ADP there is probably a reason.
fantasyfootball,3e15pn,MountOlympus97,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:23 2015 UTC,"ADP is just that, an average. There's always outliers of people who are reaching and guys thats are falling way back for some reason. I think to prepare for the draft you need to have a couple guys that you would be happy with getting in each round, kind of like what Boris Chen does for his tiers system."
fantasyfootball,3e15pn,nosliw54,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"This is kinda the ultimate question, no?  A lot of factors can go into this, most importantly knowing how your league drafts. If you feel like your league is unpredictable, then it's better to error on the side of going for the player you like best. But bottomline, I think you need to incorporate at least some level of ADP (or predicted draft position based on your league) into your drafts to get the best overall value.  It can test your nerves, and you will miss out on players now and then, but you don't win leagues without taking risks. ADP should be taken into consideration less as the draft goes on, and always know how ADP or rankings vary from your scoring system, as that could cause a specific player to go way before (or after) where you think he will go. Never fall in love with a guy, always have a backup plan. If you fall in love, you're done. I don't have a magic formula for this, there are just too many things to factor in. Who's drafting ahead/behind you? Roster needs? Who's left on your draft board? How far off is the ADP? What round is it? What can you live with? 95% of the time, 2 rounds ahead of ADP will land you any player you want."
fantasyfootball,3e15pn,thefantasydraw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"I use ADP to let me know if I can wait to grab my target players, or if it's likely safe to wait another round.

fantasyfootball,3e15pn,rageaholic55,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Stafford was hurt year after year after year. Then finally, he put it together and got 5,000 yards and came out of effectively nowhere. A guy I knew picked Stafford in the second round that year. Stafford's ADP was in the 9th or 10th. Stafford would have definitely been there in the 7th. This guy had RB problems all year, and probably would have won the league if he took Jamaal Charles right there and then Stafford later instead of Shonn Greene in like the 7th.  If I feel like a guy is multiple rounds better than his ADP, I take him 2 rounds in advance just in case. But if you feel like ""he's worth it now"" and take him, even if Stafford is worth the first rounder you spent on him, he's not a ""value"" pick there like he would have been 7 rounds later."

Keep your talent and try again next season. Find successful playoff bound teams that need help at a position and get something worth rolling into next year.

fantasyfootball,3dzzcq,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:54 2015 UTC,"My worry with keeper leagues is that since the cost of keeping a high round draft pick is (usually) really high, non-playoff teams might be likely to trade them way for less productive but way cheaper kept players.  Like, for last year, ""I'll give you Le'Veon Bell for Forsett, because Forsett will cost me a 14th round next year but Taco would cost me a 1st.""  The guy who gets Le'Veon in that deal basically seals his victory on the season."
fantasyfootball,3dzzcq,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Mon Jul 20 22:33:43 2015 UTC,"It's an element of strategy players should pay attention to, but you should never make the assumption that players entering a voluntary league are stupid. Nobody can protect players from their own dumb decisions. People made stupid add/drops and bad trades all the time. Doesn't mean they shouldn't have the opportunity to make them.  Besides, players bust out all the time. Forsett could get cut. D-Jax could piss off Chip Kelly. McCoy could get traded to the Bills. A stud player could have a bad year. There's no promise that a strategy like that is surefire enough to win a league, and if football were that easy to predcit, fantasy would be a lot easier."

It's not required, but if you choose a keeper it's automatically your 1st round pick.   This allows players who had a rough season to keep their biggest talent, or start over.

It can be any position and everyone gives up their first five picks no matter what. The reason why I like this is because if you have a solid team with 6 keeper worthy players, you can try to trade for one of them for a cheaper price (like a swap of round 10 and 9 or something). We also allow trading picks for the future. We allow 3 years in advance and this allows those bottom teams with one solid player who is trying to rebuild to sell their one player for numerous picks an try to rebuild.

One is a group of friends who have all known each other for years and have kept the league going strong even when several members moved cross country. That one is perfect for keepers.   The second is a work league and because of high turnover rate in my shop (I'm active duty so we all move a lot), so very year we have at least one new guy and two years ago it was 4 new players. Playing with keepers when you might have to replace a third of the managers is stupid.   If there's no turnover to worry about, I like keeper leagues but not dynasty.

fantasyfootball,3dyfey,AllDaveAllDay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:54 2015 UTC,I am currently doing a 32 team homer auction draft but the league has very different rules. We do 2 drafts and you start having up to 8 people from your team already in your roster. You play the same schedule as your real life team.   We do it with a 24 hour window to bid every time the bid increase. We have had some people up for 3 or 4 days before they are sold.

fantasyfootball,3dyqjf,crblack24,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:29 2015 UTC,"Priority is keeping someone who is really good.  Keeping a 6th round pick with limited future upside in the 16th may be a value, but it won't win you championships.  After that, depending on how many keepers you have and what the rules are, add however many keepers each team has to every round, and that's a more accurate value.  So if every team keeps 2 players, a 3rd round pick is more of a 5th since about 2 rounds of people will be kept (depends on how many 1-2 round keepers there are).  First round picks vary a lot more since good players won't be kept, and there may actually be first and second rounders available."

Same thing with WR - I agree Cooks is a bit of a risk in the third round, but I love him and took Smith Sr. as a bit of a safety valve.   I gotta say though, you're confusing age for safety. I would say that Johnson has a better chance of being unstartable than Cooks does. Cooks might have a tough year with all sorts of defensive attention, but he is guaranteed targets as one of 2 established options in the passing game. Johnson is getting up there in age - if his game drops off just a bit he could find himself behind Hilton (obviously), Moncrief, and one or both of the TEs on the target list.

I'd rather someone like Dalton, Cutler, or Palmer if you could get him. Their cost should be less than an 11th round pick. Ryan should be good if that line holds up and gives him more time.  RB: Besides Miller and Murray, who if they stay healthy should be good, your depth leaves something to be desired. Sims could get the job but Martin seems to have it as of now, I think West will see some touches but will eventually get outplayed by a Crowell and Johnson tandem, and Lorenzo only has value if Forsett leaves the field.   WR: Im ok with these. If Palmer plays 16 games Fitz could be a low WR2 and Smith could be his usual big play kind of guy in SF if all goes well. Quick has a nice floor and adds solid depth. Bit of a risk with your WR3/4, but I think Jordy and Tate will hold you fine.   TE: There's no need for another TE when you have Bennett. Lead TE receptions last year and should again be a focal point of the Bears this year. I like Clay, but I'm not sold until the Bills have a passable QB.

My WRs are my strongest position and i see Quick as my biggest sleeper, he should beat out Britt if he isnt the #1 option already and i really like Foles cause of his bounce back upside, i could see Quick as WR3 with a WR2/1 upside.

Of course, your scoring rules and keeper settings also come into play.  But in your league with a +1 round penalty, I'm not going out of my way to draft Luck or Rodgers early.  They're already 2nd round picks and I wouldn't keep either of them at the expense of my first round pick next season."

fantasyfootball,3dym5q,panchojulio,4,Mon Jul 20 17:22:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that you won't get to fully capitalize on the long term consistensy of a Rodgers/Brees/Manning as much as if it were a straight dynasty league.  Eventually, likely soon, the pick will end up being a first rounder.  You'll still be getting a great qb, and feel more comfortable keeping him, but you're giving up that first round pick which will likely be a quality player.  In the keeper leagues I've done, there is usually a pretty good amount of new potential keepers from year to year.  A lot of breakout rbs, young wrs, all that you can keep for mid to late round picks.  And due to the way fantasy works, those rbs have a naturally higher ceiling than the qbs.  So I'm rambling a bit, but my point is you're not getting much value due to what you're giving up in the first round pick and whatever high ceiling rb/wr you could be keeping later."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,panchojulio,3,Mon Jul 20 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"Let's say I take Luck first overall.   I feel like there will be some years that I will be tempted to keep a really good RB or WR over him for a mid-round pick, but with 3 keepers its not going to happen a lot.   Luck for a first rounder is not slam dunk value ever, but it is good value pretty much every year. There is almost always a QB or 2 in the top 10 by VBD, and I have a hard time believing that won't be Luck in 8 out of the next 10 years. That consistency would be really, really nice."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,Rynocorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"You can't just look at it as Luck for a first.  You're keeping Luck, and giving up a first (which will be a quality player most seasons.  You're doing this instead of keeping another good rb/wr, getting that player in the first, and giving up a mid-late round player that is less valuable."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that's the question, right. So in your experience you are giving up too much upside to use a first on a QB every year. I guess that makes sense."

fantasyfootball,3dym5q,kissmeimcumming,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:04 2015 UTC,"In a 3 keeper league, not many.  The first couple years will likely see more higher round players being kept, and eventually more later round players are kept as people get better values.  I've found success in overdrafting the rbs/wrs that aren't going to have value their rookie year but are good enough to contribute greatly in the future, players like Julio Jones or Carlos Hyde.  They usually have a pretty big bump in value from year 1 to 2, which means even if you don't want to keep them they can be decent trade pieces for additional picks."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,cabbagery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the initial draft isnt too important. Draft decently young but most teams have no trouble finding valuable keepers on their team at by end of the year. Always invest a late pick or two in a rookie/young WR or RB that you could see having a breakout year over an aging player that might score a few more points in the short term  Free Agency throughout the year is much bigger. Alfred Morris has been on my team his entire time in the league and he will still be worth his value as a keeper if he is playing in 6 years."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,Rynocorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:19:19 2015 UTC,"Well, FA/WW pickups cost a 7th in our league, so the end of the draft might be more important. But point taken."
fantasyfootball,3dym5q,Rynocorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"The real key to a league like this is to pepper the end of your draft with guys who are potential keepers NEXT year.  Sure, everyone loves the shiny new rookies, but you should be looking at guys who may be given the keys or may develop into something of value.    Spend some time in the Who Should I Keep thread, and read through the guys that were drafted last year in the later rounds.  A TON of people got cheap players last year as late picks or free agents that they're keeping this year because the value is so favorable."

fantasyfootball,3dy3ax,Yosoff,2,Mon Jul 20 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"Hello - 10 team, 2 QB, 1 keeper, PPR League  I am changing my league from snake draft to auction format this year.  Biggest issue currently is how to value keepers.  Previously, we had allowed each owner to keep 1 player drafted after the 3rd round.  Your keeper would then count as your pick in the same round for the year you keep them.  Owners can keep a player a maximum of 3 years.  I think the best solution would be to find the pre-season auction value of each player in the season they were drafted.  However, I am having a difficult time finding that information for a 2 QB league.  Alternatively, I figured I could find a way to assign a dollar value to each pick #.  For example, pick 1=$40, pick 2=$39, etc.  But I could use some direction on how to do that.    Any ideas?  Thanks in advance"

fantasyfootball,3dy3ax,32V2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:07 2015 UTC,2QB helps deepen the league a bit.  I'd probably go 2RB 3WR 1TE 2Flex as well.  Maybe lower the bench down to 6 players.
fantasyfootball,3dy3ax,chinaman1472,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"This is the first year i have managed a league. This league is pretty much full of my friends who are new to FF. I was hoping to receive a little guidance on making it easier for them; scoring & roster recommendations.  The league is a 8 team PPR right now.  1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex, 1 Defense, 1 K, 6 Bench, 1 IR.  Right now the only things I am debating about is the Bench size, .5 PPR or 1 PPR, and possible adding a 3rd receiver slot. Any input is welcome."
fantasyfootball,3dy3ax,shinobisynsei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"My league is 12 and we go 2 WR, 5 bench, and 1 PPR. With only 8 teams, a 6 man bench, and another WR, every team is going to be stacked but I suppose that makes things easier for people who are new."

Usually there would be the consolation bracket which would work as both were even numbers, so throwing that 5th man into the division seems to mess things up a little.  What would be the best way to format this? (Playing via ESPN FF)"

fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FFBot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:02:09 2015 UTC,"In a bit of a pickle, and trying to determine what I should do here. Here is a spreadsheet of my custom PPR league that I run. (You'll need the 3rd tab, 2015 Pre-Draft. I'm Nic, the 7th column and pick.) This is a PPR, non-snake draft dynasty league.  At this point, I'll have somewhere between the 3rd and 5th pick, depending on whether Jordy and DeMarco are kept. I'm 100% certain Rodgers will be kept, and it's logical Forte would be too.  That leaves Charles, McCoy, Calvin Johnson, Wilson, potentially Jordy, and a smattering of others available to me at the 3rd-5th pick.  Right now, I can keep EITHER Peyton or Graham. I just managed to snag Gronk in a trade, and I've also got Big Ben in the 16th (5 year keeper), so I don't really need any of those. I've shopped both around, and there's minimal interest in either.  I figure at this point, I've got 3 main options.   Keep Peyton. It's a toss-up whether I'd keep Ben at that point, or hang on to someone like Lamar Miller. Drop both Peyton and Graham, and gamble on the first round pick. We'll all know 2 weeks before the draft who is keeping/dropping people, so I'd have time to prepare a strategy. (My personal fav) Keep Graham. Then I have the top 2 TE in the game. Could use one in my FLEX spot each week, or dangle Graham as trade bait.   What say you, Reddit?  EDIT: No, we're not dumb people and drafting randoms in super early rounds. This is a dynasty keeper league that I run. You can look in the first tab for explanations of how the rules/keepers work, if you're curious."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,niclake13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't keep Peyton, Ben or Graham.  I would seriously consider keeping Miller, but not at the expense of losing out on one of the draft pick possibilities that you listed."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"If i get what you're saying correctly, you will lose your first round pick if you keep one of the two right? Graham in Seattle is still a high value but if you're giving up the chance to draft one of Charles/Calvin/Jordy for it, i don't think it's worth it.  Depending on what pick you end up having, if the amount of elite players being thrown back gives you the chance to draft one if you don't keep one of yours, drop them both. Otherwise, keep Graham."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't keep either. If i'm reading this right and you get to keep Big Ben or a 16th, that's crazy good value and he's more valuable to you than Peyton given his cost.     (My personal fav) Keep Graham. Then I have the top 2 TE in the game. Could use one in my FLEX spot each week, or dangle Graham as trade bait.   I wouldn't take a player because he's tradebait. He's great but isn't worth your 1st round pick - at best he'll be a low yards, high TDs player finishing with a line of 800/9. While thats great, I'd much rather have a 1st round ceiling with a guy like Megatron or Charles, which graham just doesn't have as far as we know. Already having Gronk makes the choice even more clear."

fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, sorry that was unclear. In the trade I give up Jeremy Hill and the 13th overall for LeSean McCoy and the 17th overall. It would just be a swap of our second round picks."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FergusonX,2,Mon Jul 20 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I just wanted to be certain before offering advice.  I'd say to avoid that trade.    I'm ASSuming that Luck is going to be your other keeper (at 6pts per passing TD, he's in the conversation for #1 overall pick).  Right now ADP of McCoy and Hill are RB10 and RB11, and they are only 4 picks apart overall.  That tells me that the consensus is that these two are very nearly the same expected value, and the drop from 13th to 17th overall isn't worth the cost of ""moving up"" to get McCoy.  After all the keepers are declared, the dropoff is going to go fast with the remaining players in the pool, and I'd much rather have #13 than #17."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"Luck is definitely my other keeper, I was thinking of just keeping Hill and my pick before, but seeing someone else thinking the same thing helped make me sure. Thanks for your thoughts."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FergusonX,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"I'd rather just keep Hill. LeSean McCoy isn't on a high scoring offense and he's playing behind a patchy offensive line with no QB, under a coach who's favorite run is straight up the middle (which is exactly why Chip Kelly traded him away in the first place). Hill's team is significantly better at taking pressure off of him (Green/Jones/Eifert) and has a significantly better OL (the last two years have finished top 12 in run blocking on PFF) while also drafting even more O-line this year. I don't think it's worth it to move Hill."

Most points gets to choose his draft spot first. Second most gets second pick in draft slot and so on. Our keeper rules are 3 players at a two round price.  So should we have to declare keepers before we draft for draft spots? Or should we draft spots before declaring keepers? Depending on who I choose to keep and when will affect where I want to draft from. Alternatively, my draft slot (I pick my slot 6th) will affect who I may choose to keep.   It's a catch 22"

Ex: Julio Jones drafted in the 2nd round last season, his cost would be a 1st rounder this year. Jamaal Charles was drafted in thefirst round last season, his cost is 1 keeper, leaving me with only 1 more keeper.  2014 Team(Potential Keepers):  1)Jamaal Charles  2) Julio Jones  4) Gronk  8) Kelvin Benjamin  9) Emmanuel Sanders  10) Mike Evans  Gronk is a no brainer to keep. Which leaves me with Jamal Charles as my final keeper or Julio Jones paired with Benj/Evans/Sanders.  Sanders was great last year esp in PPR, but Denver seems like it will be a run first team.  Evans was a stud as well having multiple monster games, but will Winston help or hurt him?  Benjamin had moments last season as Cams RZ target, but his drops left yards and TDs on the field. Offseason reports haven't been nice on Benjamin.  So what route should I go?"

fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"Draft is randomized so it's a toss up on who I get. If I get first pick I can definitely throw Jamal back in. This is not a particularly bright league. Only 3 people including me really know what we're doing come draft day in this 12 team league (I ended up with 11-3 record). So what gets thrown back will be highly varied. If everyone was smart and kept there RB1 last year and I don't get Charles back, I may end up having to draft Gordon or Ingram as my RB1."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,Ferrari-murakami,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm...drafting with guppies, eh?  It's tough to offer good advice in this situation because there's literally no way to know what the rest of the league is going to do.    If you think that the draft is certain to be full of bargains, you can safely keep Charles and not worry about having your full complement of keepers."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,FredFlanders,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:17:19 2015 UTC,"Normally i'm all about grabbing the proven safe routes and my gut is telling me Charles/Gronk is the way to go because you know how ridiculously high your TD potential is on a week to week. But grabbing Julio and Evans seems like a much easier way to dominate your league. I put together this post before on how rookie QBs distribute their targets, and basically whenever there is an established WR1 that player finishes as a top 16 scorer in their position. Normally, i think Evans is crazy overpriced in the 3rd but for a 10th he's insane value with too much upside to pass up, especially since you can pair him with Julio Jones (Shanahan once targetted PIerre Garcon 180 times btw) and Gronkowski."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go a little off the main route and say you don't keep Julio.  Julio goes in the 2nd round usually, and you're giving up a first rounder which as you said, you might need to draft Ingram or Gordon for your RB1, which is not ideal, so you don't want to drop even lower for your RB1.  Instead, if you pick up Sanders and Evans as your other two keepers, then you get a solid enough WR duo where it won't be a weakness (maybe even a strength), and you can still use your early 2 picks to get a strong RB duo."

I need to select two keepers and out league rule is, your keepers go to your team two rds earlier than they were selected last year.  If not drafted, you get them in the 12th rd.  If multiple players would be slotted in the same rd, you would take that player one rd earlier.  My first keeper will be ODB which I will get in the 12th rd as I picked him up as a  FA last year.  I have three other possibilities: 1)  Kelvin Benjamin, which I would get in the 9th rd, 2) Travis Kelce, which I would get in the 11th rd, or 3) Joseph Randle, which I would get in the 11th rd."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,samiam78,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Keep Kelce. I'm a pure Benjamin hater, horrible player in every way with horrible football skills. The drafting of Funchess isn't just to get another player on the outside, it's their insurance because they're not in the belief that Benjamin is going to develop. Randle's a luck-based risk, but in the 11th round the gamble is basically free, however why gamble when you have Kelce? Alex Smith only throws to TEs and RBs, and last year he was ridiculous despite only playing 60% of the teams snaps."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,NannigarCire,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"If you can wait until closer to the start of the season, Randle might be your huckleberry.  I'd want to see him win the starting RB job and do well in a couple of preseason games before doing that, though.  If you have to choose sooner, I'd take Benjamin because of your starting rules.  TE can't be flexed and you only need one that you could probably stream at a very cheap cost."

For either I effectively give up a 12th round pick out of 14 rounds.  10 team league, half PPR.  Martavis exploded on to last year mid-season, he fizzled a bit late but still made some plays even after teams caught on.  He's reportedly put on a few pounds, and Antonio Brown means he isn't going to be facing top CBs.  He seems more like a bit of a risky high-upside play.  Keenan had a great rookie year, and hit the sophomore slump last year.  He seems like a really nice bounce back candidate, and he on the other hand has lost a little weight to gain some speed.  This seems like the slightly safer play, as even last year's numbers would make for an ok WR3, if that's his floor."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,kciuq1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:21:34 2015 UTC,"I take Allen. Bryant didn't particularly play well last year, but his team put him in the position to make plays through good scheming and just sending him out deep, which is something he pretty easily wins at. Until pre-season arrives and we get to see what year-2 Bryant looks like, i wouldn't feel comfortable keeping him over Allen. Allen had more targets last year than in his rookie year, so his team is still committing to using him. The early season loss of Gates to suspension should also give Allen plenty of opportunities early in the year to prove he's back, and if he has a good 3 weeks his trade value might be inflated."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely keep Allen, he's the WR1 on the team with great upside.  Bryant on the other hand is well below Brown and will be fighting with Wheaton, Coates, and Heath Miller for the leftover looks."

The penalty for keeping a player is that for each player you keep, you lose that number of draft picks (keep two players, you lose your first two picks etc). You're allowed to keep players for as many years as you'd like. This is the situation I'm in.   Since I can only keep one, I'm very torn between Odell Beckham Jr and AJ Green. Both are studs but I'm leaning towards ODB due to age and quality of qb. What is Beckhams ceiling compared to what Green has already shown he can do? Is he just a younger aj green or does he have the potential to be the best wr in the game in the next couple years? It's hard to judge because of the hype from last year.   Also with our 2 QB league, is it worth keeping PFM in our league at essentially a 3rd round pick (I'm using one of my first two picks on Beckham/Green and the other pick on leveon bell)? So with Bell's suspension and Mannings age, would it be worth letting Manning go in favor of drafting a different qb or a RB in the third round to help my team the 2-3 weeks Bell is out?"

I'm usually not an advocate for keeping a QB but you don't have any value to gain by keeping any of the others over him in my opinion. Lynch's age isn't something to significantly worry about, although age-regression hits for most RBs around 29/30, Lynch at his core plays a very mental game of football that should keep him producing up until 31/32, it's only supported by his ridiculous physicality, not to mention this years Seahawks look to have a much more efficient and defense spreading offense with Lockett and Graham, which should give more scoring opportunities to Lynch."
fantasyfootball,3dy33c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:39 2015 UTC,"I asked before but I just re-looked at my team and totally forgot about another option.    Our league allows you to keep one player for a draft spot two rounds higher than they were taken the year before and no higher then a 10th rounder.  Additionally we cannot keep anyone drafted in the 5th or earlier round.  Standard scoring 12 team league.  My options:  Mike Evans - Drafted in the 9th round last year so I'd be giving up a 7th rounder and could potentially keep him for one more year after this  Tre Mason - Undrafted last year so I'd be giving up a 10th rounder.  I realize Gurley is the future, but where is he on a return schedule?  Probably not much of a value after this year  Joseph Randle -  I totally forgot I picked him up as Murray's handcuff late last season.  He was undrafted so I'd be giving up a 10th rounder.   Initially I was thinking Tre Mason, then Gurley happened.  Then I was thinking Evans, his ADP makes him a pretty good keeper value in the 7th.  If I had seen more out of Randle last year I'd be happy(well maybe not?  I did have Murray after all).  I know that OLine will be stout, but the backfield seems pretty crowded.   I do not have to pick my keeper until August 20th so I could see how training camp shakes out a bit first too."

We can keep a single player from last year for our pick two rounds above where we drafted them.  My viable options are Frank Gore for pick 4.11 or Sammy Watkins for pick 7.2   Both look to be about the same value (14-16 picks after their ADP).  I'm leaning towards keeping Gore since I can have my pick of the RB's after the 1st overall drafts and then take 2 WR's at 2.11 and 3.2 knowing I have him as my RB2.

fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,dp1389,6,Mon Jul 20 14:24:24 2015 UTC,Losing trestman lowers his value because he probably won't catch as many passes as last year. He's also 30 or turning 30 during the season.
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,detphi1,0,Mon Jul 20 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Now who do we handcuff him with?  Langford, Carey, or Jaquizz?  Some people like to insure their first round picks, and Forte is uninsurable."

fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,detphi1,3,Tue Jul 21 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"This has been the biggest dilemma in all my mocks and I'm still trying to rationalize picking one over the other. I still cannot decide on who I'm taking at this point because I pick 7th, which typically means Foster, Anderson, or Forte fall to me. Foster/Forte carry the highest drop off in terms of production - or injury risk, at least with Foster, and Anderson carries TONS of risk but tremendous amount of reward. I say that because if he fails then Montee Ball steps up and reclaims his job (the irony) then it's goodbye CJA. They also didn't invest such a high round pick in Ball just to have him on the bench.  Honestly, if I'm going purely on who I think can finish top 5, then it's probably Foster. He showed last year he can stay relatively healthy, post 1,200+ yard season, and still do major damage catching out of the backfield (5 rec TD's). He's finished top 5 four times in 5 years."
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,moonftball12,3,Mon Jul 20 18:01:27 2015 UTC,Gronk... because of the smash...
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,ronswansonaswansong,3,Mon Jul 20 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here said take Foster but I'm against it. Is he a great RB when healthy, yes. I hate labeling a player injury prone, its what allowed me to take Gronk last year. I believe that most injuries are due to luck. However, Foster has a distrubing history of soft tissue injuries. In my eyes, injuries like this are not due to luck, and they suggest that Foster has a weakness and is more likley to contract these kinds of injuries. I'm not a doctor, but i'm sure there is something genetically that makes a person's soft tissue more susceptible to tears/strains. again, i'm no doctor, but it seems like Foster has a great deal of soft tissue injures since 2011.   I found this useful site: http://sportsinjurypredictor.com/injury-predictor/player/9527   In my eyes, the pick here is a WR. I think u take Brown, and then take an RB like Hill with your pick in the mid 2nd round (or pray that someone like McCoy falls into your lap).  If your truly adamant about taking a RB though, i think u take the safest guy and go with Forte. Dont expect last years receptions, but his floor is pretty high.    Either way, i think the goal in the 1st round should be getting someone safe with a high floor. Your already spending a 1st round pick, drafting somone with upside has always been confusing to me because your already spending a 1st round pick. I think u play it safe, take A Brown, followed by Hill in the 2nd if u like him (i do), and then take Lamar Miller/Morris if u want a safe pick in the 3rd round, or Melvin Gordon if u want a high upside pick in the 3rd/4th round (i love MG3 this year). Thats a pretty solid team right there and you can spend the next few rounds stocking on WR and maybe even grab another RB or a QB if u please"
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,odellbeckham13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Ive been wrestling with this dilemma all mock draft season. To me it comes down to a pros vs cons list.  Foster - Best skills of the group. Injury prone. Bad offense and bad QB (will see 8 in the box). Strong defense to help keep games close. No solid backup to trust as a cuff. Focal point of his team. Great ppr back. Nearly 30. 3 down back. Goaline work.  Forte - Great ppr back. Bad defense but he catches passes during garbage time. Decent qb and wr to keep the box honest. Lower ceiling but high floor. Lost Trestman so passes will decrease. No solid backup to trust as cuff. Nearly 30. 3 down back.   Anderson - Great offense so box will stay honest. Only half a season of work, basically a sophmore season. Decent backup to handcuff. Okay ppr back. Not the focal point of team. Kubiak likes to run the ball. Solid dynasty back. Double digit td potential. High ceiling but possibly low floor. Lowest talent of list. Likely a 2 down back.   Murray - great offense with high play volume. Best backup of the list to cuff. Run first team. Injury prone. Coming off high volume season. Good ppr back. Talent wise he's top 2 or 3 of list. Goaline work. Likely a two down back.  McCoy - bad offense so 8 in the box is likely. Will have huge workload. Ok backup to cuff in jackson remains. Wil be focal point of offense. Great defense to keep games close. Will see all goaline snaps. Great ppr back. 3 down back. Run first team. 300 touch potential.  Tl;dr  Foster - Most talent but expect an injury.  Forte - low ceiling high floor but getting old.  Anderson - great offense to score tds but small sample size.  Murray - Run first, high volume  offense but injury risk. Also has the most trusted handcuff.  McCoy - Guaranteed high volume but with a bad offense defenses will gameplan only him.  Right now im gambling on Murray because he has the best combo of talent, worload, ppr, goalline and a solid backup as insurance. And honestly its knowing his handcuff is still capable of having a top 10 rb season thats putting him at the top. None of the other backs (maaaaybe Anderson/Ball) have a backup i would trust if they went down.  Tl;dr - Murray in the 1st, Matthews in the 5-7."
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,BecauseYouGoogledMe,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of this, but the fact remains, why did McCoy's production drop in the Philly scheme last year, and what are the chances that this will happen to Murray?"
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,BecauseYouGoogledMe,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:23 2015 UTC,Pure speculation on my part but I dont think mccoy fit in kellys system. He wants a between the tackle beast and a ppr/scatback to sub in. Now he has both. Mccoy is great but he dances too much.
fantasyfootball,3dy2x6,moonftball12,2,Mon Jul 20 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Murray missed 11 games in 4 seasons, will lose some touches due to Matthews and Sproles, and he also has a history of injury. McCoy will also lose some production with FJax still there, because we've seen Spiller lose work in the past. Also, he will not see ""all goalline snaps"" either because he's never been a great goal line back and FJax and Dixon are thumpers - they will get some GL work between the tackles.

fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,indabasszone,4,Mon Jul 20 14:03:03 2015 UTC,We're very similar:   Antonio Dez Julio Calvin Demaryius Jordy AJ Cobb
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,fytfootball,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:17:58 2015 UTC,Cobb over ODB is almost insane...any deep justification or you're just not a believer?
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,PillsburyD0peb0y,8,Mon Jul 20 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"My draft strategy is to get the most value out of every pick. I use my top picks on guys who I think will have the best chance to play up to their value.  Your 1st round pick has very little chance to exceed his value. That's the nature of a 1st round pick. There's very little room to go up, and a whole lot of room to go down. Cobb is a possession receiver. He runs the high percentage routes. He's on an elite offense with an elite QB. He's performed at the low WR1-high WR2 level for consecutive years. He consistently puts up receptions, yards, and TDs -- a very well-rounded WR from a statistical point of view. He's still very young and his skill set is still on the upswing. And nothing has changed in his offense since last year. Absolutely nothing. Every starting player will be starting again.  What is the chance the Cobb performs below his ADP? Very little. And if so, it won't be by very much.  I seek value picks in later rounds. Guys who have a lot of upside. I can risk a bust in later rounds because my top picks are the pinnacle of reliability.  As for OBJ, he only has a half season of production. I think he's an elite talent from the eye test, but fantasy football is largely a game of statistics, and there's a concern about sample size. He catches passes from a QB I do not trust (admittedly I think Eli is a worse QB than most people seem to think). The pieces around him are changing. There are some question marks like how will Cruz's return impact his coverage and targets. Will the running game rebound?  It's about risk/reward. I think OBJ has a higher ceiling and a lower floor. Guys like that can win leagues. But guys like that exist in lower rounds. Guys like Frank Gore, Joseph Randall, Nelson Agholor, or Dwayne Allen. Those guys all have similar ceilings and floors as OBJ (relative to their positions). The chance they reach their ceiling is lower, which is why you pay a lower price. If they perform, you get 2nd round value out of a 6th round pick. If they don't perform, you wasted a 6th round pick, not a 2nd.  I didn't plan to write this much, but I want to add in that my strategy also relies on my mid-season fantasy skill. I play the waiver wire and trade like a mother fucker. I've started off many seasons at 0-3 and fixed my team enough to make the playoffs. I'm confident in my ability to add value to my team throughout the season. But if you miss your 1st/2nd round studs, you have a lot less to work with. So if you pick a guy like OBJ in the 2nd, and maybe he's not a complete bust but let's say he performs like a WR2, you made a bad pick. You can get WR2 talent off the waiver wire for $1. In 12-team leagues or less, studs rule. I want as many studs as I can get, because I'm confident in my ability to fill in the holes."

Brown  Julio  AJ  Dez  DT  Jordy  Cobb  Megatron  then OBJ and the cluster fuck of guys after that.   There are a few breakout and value guys I like as well like Marvin Jones and Shorts in PPR leagues but they have issues with their body
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,2,Mon Jul 20 13:41:45 2015 UTC,Taking high injury risks in Julio and AJ over proven studs in Dez/DT is a recipe for disaster
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,2,Mon Jul 20 14:50:44 2015 UTC,How is AJG now an injury risk?
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Red-Yeti,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"Not an overwhelming injury risk, but Sports Injury Predictor claims that the turf toe injury is one that has a good chance to linger this season. Their algorithm they use is thoroughly formulated and fairly accurate, so I trust it."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, I personally think AJ is a much higher risk than drafting AJ. Any sane person wouldn't even think about taking AJ over AJ after the season that AJ just had."

fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:26 2015 UTC,You put AJ in both those lists.  I assume you meant Dez/DT?
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,atonyatlaw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:10:52 2015 UTC,"So Julio and AJ having one year of injuries is an injury risk? Julio last year put up 1593 yards, caught 104 balls and had 6 TD's which was the only downside. He was averaging 116 yards per game the year before when he got injured. He also had pretty much 1200 yards and 10 TD's the year before.   AJ put up over 1300 yards in the two seasons prior to last with 11 TD's and had turf toe last year.   Both guys I would say also have less questionable QB scenarios. You know what AJ can do with Dalton, Ryan is what he is. Romo has no running game right now which I see boding worse for Dez since Romo's back is fucked and throwing more is not exactly a positive. Manning could pretty much be done if the tail end of last year is anything to go off. They will still get their numbers but the upside is greater for someone like Jones and AJ is the best value of the elite WR's. The top 5 guys are interchangeable but Julio and AJ are elite with the body of work to prove it"
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:06:26 2015 UTC,"Julio's injury history spans further than this season: He missed the entire 2013 season with a foot injury, and also missed games in 2011 and the 2013 preseason due to a pulled hamstring. Sports injury predictor has him as one of the greatest injury risks among 1st rounders, and I am not willing to take that risk when Dez/DT are perfect capable of putting up similar numbers.  The argument you made about Dez is valid, but he is too talented (perhaps the best WR in the league right now) to not put up his typically elite numbers. It may not be pretty, but Romo will force feed Dez, especially in the redzone.   As for Green, turf toe is a injury that has a good chance of lingering this season. He is less of an injury risk than Jones but doesn't have the same upside. I would be happy to take him late second, early third but certainly not over the elite WRs in the league."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,4,Mon Jul 20 15:23:08 2015 UTC,Julio missed 1 game last year. The year he got injured (the previous season) I listed his stats in the 5 games he played and he was a monster. The year before he played every game. Your injury stats on him are flat out wrong.   Green will be fine. Turf toe is generally a seasonal thing. They had to krep playing him because Sanu became the number 1. He will be fine this year and add in a healthy Jones opposite him it should see the offense flow better.
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:37 2015 UTC,This is the most accurate ranking ITT. You arent gargling OBJs nuts like most people are.
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,mtbike,3,Mon Jul 20 14:25:44 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't we be gargling his nuts? Dude put up consistently elite numbers in his rookie year. Julio/AJ/Jordy/Megatron are significantly higher injury risks and Cobb's upside is not in the same stratosphere as OBJ's.
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:20 2015 UTC,"He did, but some of us would like to see him do it again before we potentially waste a high draft pick on him. Sometimes things line up perfectly for rookies to have great years then they come crashing back down to Earth."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Thunderstruck79,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:51 2015 UTC,"That is fair, but has there been a precedent to that type of performance in a WR's rookie year? I thought the sample size was decent enough to not consider it a likely aberration, but I understand there is some hesitation. With that being said, on the eye test alone, he clearly is an otherworldly talent (unbelievable catch radius and soft hands, blinding speed).   I still think you can have tampered expectations of him and still draft him over the likes of Cobb and Green."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,2,Mon Jul 20 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm just paranoid about that sort of thing. He does it again this year then congrats, he's in the club."

fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:05 2015 UTC,Considering you think Green is an injury risk OBJ I would have just as big a cross next to his name. Read what he said post pro bowl regarding his hamstrings and the fact he missed a large chunk of the season
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"OBJ is a huge injury risk as well, but you have to consider risk vs. reward/upside/floor. I will not refuse to draft any player solely based on injury risk, but I will certainly take it into consideration when evaluating a player's value relative to others. OBJ may be a huge injury risk (Sportsinjurypredictor.com has him as 88%), but his upside/talent level is higher enough compared to Cobb/Green that I would be willing to take a risk on him.  As for Jones, he is a player with a very high injury risk. I don't think the risk is worth the reward of possibly putting up slightly better numbers than Dez/DT"
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:57 2015 UTC,I think you're putting a bit too much faith in that site. I just did a quick search of one of the more injury prone players in the league (Murray) and he was at 48%.   I would rather look at the whole team situation and body of work. AJ and Julio both have favorable situations with the body of work to back it up
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"The algorithm they use is based on historical data and is fairly accurate. The 48% rate takes into consideration his injury history, but they argue that as long as his workload this season is limited (due to Mathews getting carries), then he has a decent chance of staying healthy."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,HubieFuckingBrown,4,Mon Jul 20 17:50:43 2015 UTC,"Here's how they shake out for me:  Tier 1   Brown, Dez, DT    All three are a pretty safe bet for 1300+ yards and 10+ TDs. Brown was the top guy last year but all three of these guys have a shot at being #1 this year.   Tier 2   Julio - Julio can get the yards but can he get the TD's required to be a top 3 guy? It's possible but not as likely as the three above him. Megatron - The question for Calvin is, will he play 16 games? Guarantee he plays a full season and I'm taking him as the first WR off the board. Jordy - Questions about his hip and having a super talented WR in Cobb taking away some production. Aaron Rodgers can sustain them both but it's still a limiting factor. OBJ - He's an incredible talent but it's a big risk to take him over the other guys, especially given Eli's tendency to have a handful of awful games. AJ Green - AJ Probably deserves to be higher up. It's the Andy Dalton factor keeping him down. He was fantastic in 13 games last year, on pace for the most yards in a season of his career. It also worries me that their run game has improved a ton and Cincinnati might lean on Hill/Bernard more than they have in the past.   Tier 3   Cobb - No reason why he should really drop off this year. I don't buy that Adams will eat into Cobb's receptions at all. Jeffery - He's in a great situation to have a monster season. As bad as Cutler can be, he can also produce a top tier WR. I don't think White will have a huge impact right away. Evans - Big guy, big endzone threat. Winson is an upgrade at QB. Should improve on last years numbers. TY Hilton - I think he could have more yards this year but his TD are few and far between, especially with Andre on the team now."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,bananapanther,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"Being a Packer fan from Wisconsin I think Jordy and Cobb are great. Adams will get more yards, catches and TD's than last year. Towards the end of the year and into the playoffs the guy was playing great and this offseason everything I have read says Rodgers is calling for an Adams breakout season. Jordy and Cobb will still be great I believe but Adams will be taking a larger slice of that pie."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Gdangles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he will see more targets than last year but I'm not sure the production is going to spike that much.

I keep posting this everywhere, I guess because I keep hearing the same thing everywhere I look. I don't think Winston is an upgrade to Tampa Bay's QB play last year vs. this year. He is a rookie. McCown/Glennon went for 3600/21 last year. Unless your name is Peyton, Luck, Cam, or Russell, you are unlikely to do that well your rookie year. Can he do it? Sure. But I get tired of people saying that Winston is a sure upgrade when he'll have to have a top 5 rookie passing campaign to even equal the production that Evans got from his QBs last year."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Guido420,2,Mon Jul 20 17:03:58 2015 UTC,"That's a fair argument and I can't really say anything to the contrary. I never watched Winston in college so admittedly, I'm getting most of my information regarding Tampa Bay's situation from people smarter than me."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,bananapanther,7,Mon Jul 20 17:38:21 2015 UTC,"If it's PPR?  Probably goes like this when it's all said and done:   DT Dez Julio   The Broncos are supposed to throw more short passes this year, so if that's the case, DT is going to see a volume increase while his YPC average ought to go down. Dez is going to get leaned on heavily, but you aren't going to see the ball in the air for 12+ yards and turn into a ton of receptions simply because those are lower percentage plays.  Julio may be near the top of the league in YPC which means he'll have a lot of games with gobs of yards, but maybe not as many receptions. He can do in one play of 40 yards what Antonio Brown needs 3 plays to do. In PPR, I can't imagine someone who can stretch the field turning the NFL on it's head and hauling down 85% of his targets of 20+ yards deep.   It's all a percentages game. What's interesting is that DT only caught 60% of his targets, while Dez and Julio caught 63% last year.  This year we should see Dez' volume go way up (Julio had more volume) and see Julio's YPC go up and his conversion percentage go down. See, the Falcons aren't going to throw bubble screens and shit at him all day. And he won't have a year like DT where he had a whopping 184 targets, which was just insane.  DT will still have tons of targets, but much higher percentage throws which will mean a better catch rate. It wouldn't surprise me if DT still had 180 targets and caught 130 of them. Dez only had 134 targets all of last year; his volume ought to go way up with no RB around. Julio's role is going to be to spread defenses out by running downfield and stretching the defense.  Beckham I will just leave out as there isn't a good baseline to compare."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,smacksaw,15,Mon Jul 20 03:26:31 2015 UTC,A whole lot of sleeping on AJ Green going on in this thread.
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,fbomb4,3,Mon Jul 20 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"All else being fairly equal (imo most of the best receivers are VERY close in terms of ability), what QB do you want throwing to your receiver? Yes, AJ is a beast, but when you have to give up a tier 1 (Peyton) or tier 2 (Ryan, Romo) QB for Dalton, why take the chance?"

I'd still go Antonio because Dez is probably the most likely of the bunch to have those dud (12 points or less in PPR) games. Antonio is pretty dud-proof.

fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Cifra00,4,Mon Jul 20 10:22:23 2015 UTC,"Julio, OBJ, Calvin, Dez, Jordy, DT round out the top tier for me.  Edit: reasoning  Julio - Insane explosion and yardage totals, Shanahan X receivers are target monsters  OBJ - After the bye when he broke out his worst game was 6 catches for 93 yards. We still have set to see a defense stop him (this includes a 100+ yard game vs Seattle). Some risk involved due to a small sample size.  Calvin - Most physically talented receiver ever. Even in an injury plagued season he put up 1000 yards. Emergence of Golden Tate means he probably won't see the stupid numbers of years past, but he's still one of the best.  Dez - Murray going could be good (more % of the offense flowing through him) or bad (more one - dimensional of an offense). Lowest yardage totals of the elite receivers, and I trust yardage between years to be more constant than touchdowns, which is why I have him down here.  Jordy - Elite quarterbacks are a double edged sword in that they give beautiful passes but spread the ball around. Hip surgery is worrisome, as well as Adams's emergence, but he's been very good as the #1 in Green Bay.  DT - I'd have him a lot higher if not for my worries about Manning. DT is a monster but I'm scared that Manning's poor finish was more age related than injury related and that this could hamper Thomas next year. Because of the risk I see here I'd rather take any of the other top guys."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,zimmeli,4,Mon Jul 20 03:06:09 2015 UTC,"The thing about DT is that even if manning is going down a bit, he is arguably the best after the catch. He can bust one of those bubble screens they throw him at at any moment"
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,Cifra00,4,Mon Jul 20 03:38:22 2015 UTC,"And that's something I'll admit - I'm trying to find something I don't like to differentiate these guys in the slightest, but DT finished the season on three 100+ yard games, so it's a weak argument. These top receivers are all incredibly tight in my eyes"
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,zimmeli,0,Mon Jul 20 03:43:04 2015 UTC,Yeah it's hard. I'm hoping I have an earlier pick so I can grab a stud RB and then in the second I'll have an easier decision with whoever is left of these guys

The only thing I'm having a hard time with, is talking myself out of not going with OBJ if given the choice. As an OBJ owner last year, he was money, and I easily considered him my WR1 by season's end over my ""WR2"", DT. I do have concerns over Julio's continued ankle problems, he seems the most likely to bust on this list (if not for that, he'd probably be my #1 WR over anyone).  People are forgetting about Calvin, I like him 3rd on your list.  Bottomline, this is a tightly packed group. I'm hoping the rest of the league gets RB happy and Antonio Brown falls to me in every draft, otherwise there will be some tough choices on draft day."

Now that Murray is gone, his scoring opportunities, especially in the red zone, will go up.  I don't give a damn if Peyton rolls out on the field on a mobility scooter--as long as DT has Peyton throwing to him, he'll be amazing.  Julio is interesting. The talent and upside is obviously there, but I see him as more of an injury risk than others. However, he's hugely talented and is the primary weapon in an offense run by Matt Ryan. He'll put up big numbers if healthy.  Calvin Johnson is still the best receiver in the game today. But is it possible that all of his usage is finally catching up with him? He missed a few games last year due to injury, and he ""played"" in a few others where he was simply used as a decoy even though he was hurt. I have him on the same level as Julio; they're basically a coin-flip to me.  OBJ's upside is huge. He could very well finish as the top fantasy receiver. However, I have a couple minor concerns. The Sophomore Slump worries me; opposing teams may gameplan around him and try to slow him down as much as possible. The return of Victor Cruz could take away from OBJ's numbers as well. And then there's the sample size argument. Any way you slice it, regression is nearly inevitable.  Jordy Nelson. We've heard it all. Scrappy. Deceptive speed. Gym rat. White. I think his upside isn't as high as the aforementioned guys, but he is as safe as can be as long as the best quarterback on the planet is throwing to him.  Green is at least as talented than most of the aforementioned guys. So why so low? Injury risk is one reason. He's not a safe pick for that reason alone IMO. Additionally, I'm not a fan of the system he plays in and quarterback he plays with. This team has a budding a two-headed monster in the backfield; they would be wise to give them the ball as much as possible. I think this takes away from Green's value. He's an otherworldly talent, but he's the bottom of this tier of guys IMO.  I could be wrong. But that's my logic."

Detroit lost suh. And chicago and minny can be tore up by gb. (This pains me to say as a bears fan)  Dt has pfm still Even though he's almost 40 and dt is a monster. Injury concerns to pfm scare me a little bit but I'm willing to role the dice.   Julio should have a nice year with the new system in play and I trust him a bit more than obj. Playing in a dome vs playing in ny also may come into play later in the year may not who knows. Not that it matters all that much any way.   Obj is a interesting case but it's hard to rank him above these other guys just do to the small sample size. He's a freak of nature it seems and totally could out score some of the guys above, but I'm willing to let some one else gamble on him as of now.   God when does preseason start"

fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,XCypher73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"Green was a first round pick last year with Dalton. Dalton had to deal with an injured Green, no Marvin Jones,  and no Tyler Eifert.  I think Dalton's poor performance can be contributed to that.   He has everyone back and you have to expect a significantly better year from Dalton, as well as an improved effort from a healthy Green,  which makes him a perfectly reliable WR1."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,vivalahendy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I think the only WR to go in the first round last year was Calvin, maybe DT, but not Green. And i just think Dalton is a bad QB. Lol.  The fact he has everyone back, isn't necessarily a good thing, Dalton will be throwing less and there will be more targets to throw too. Though I am sure Green will still get his.  These comments seem to suggest I am shitting on Green in some way, I really like Green! He is my 8th favorite WR in fantasy this year, I would happily take him in the 2nd round (along with most of the other player mentioned here). I would be very happy if he was on my team. There just happens to be 7 other WR I like better."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,XCypher73,0,Tue Jul 21 07:12:37 2015 UTC,"In two of my 12 team leagues last season,  Green went end of first round. In my 10 teamer, I had pick 9 and took him with my second pick. He was essentially a first rounder based on the number of teams.   The more healthy players there are,  the better for everyone on the offense, except for maybe Sanu.  I may be coming off as a big Dalton supporter, but I'm not. I just think he's in for an improved year ,  and with his current ADP,  he could make for a solid QB2 or bye week filler."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,dawnofhammer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:27:18 2015 UTC,You do know that he was on pace for 1500 yards and 10 td's last year right? WR5 in ppr scoring. It's true he can be so much more without Dalton but he's as good as anyone even with him.
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,vivalahendy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:10:33 2015 UTC,"In ESPN STD scoring he was WR23, which is what I am basing this off. Granted that was 12 games, but Calvin only played 1 more game and he was WR13. Above anything else, I also think they make Dalton throw less and run with Hill and dump off to Gio and Eifert, so I think he see's less yards. Again, I would be happy with him in my team as WR1, I wouldn't be surprised if he is a top 5 WR, I just want the other guys first."
fantasyfootball,3dwdqq,dawnofhammer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"He would have still been the WR5 in scoring if his pace held up. He played 11 games not 12 BTW.

Anyway, this might have become exaggerated, we are talking about the difference between the middle of the second to the end of the second. Lol. There really isn't much in it, but those question marks you mention are exactly why he is below the other guys."

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,snaxsnax,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:53 2015 UTC,"Murray has Helu, who is probably better than McFadden. He is also on a better team, with a better o-line.   Murray also had 82 carries last year and got a cocky. RBs who get conkies are dangerous business."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:50 2015 UTC,"Well, fantasy production is usually a combo of three main factors: 1) natural ability, 2) opportunity (carries, targets) and 3) team around you. Dallas' offense is obviously better than the Raiders', but Latavius arguably wins in factors one and two.    Now, I think a lot of people are greatly overestimating Darren McFadden - if the Dallas coaches have already realized it, they will after a few games - that he's a bad fit for their scheme and has little left in the tank. That said, doesn't mean Randle will be their guy. As silly as the Chris Johnson rumors seemed it wouldn't surprise me if they signed him and he was their leading rusher at this point."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Magnusblitz,5,Mon Jul 20 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"1) natural ability - Murray's measurables are obviously vastly superior, but randle's vision looked great last season and his burst is better in game than you would think. The sample is too small to judge who has more ability, but it's not as though Murray was a revelation last year. He had a two game stretch where he had 165 yards on 76 carries and was unremarkable thereafter (3.6 YPC). Randle achieved his 6.7 YPC in a similar manner - a bunch of monster carries - and was not great in 2012 behind a weaker offensive line, albeit in a small sample as well. But Murray is not the only guy to have shown potential and neither is a revelation by any means.   2) Opportunity - Murray and Randle both appear to have the starting role locked up. Murray will have to deal with McFadden as a COP, while Murray will have to deal with the superior passing back in Helu. The Raiders staff has also been apprehensive to give the keys to Murray, and they signed the abhorrent Trent Richardson this offseason. Both these players have the inside track to a starting role, but neither is a sure thing.   However, there is more to opportunity than just competition. Last year the Boys ran the ball 508 times to the Raiders 337. That gap might close a bit - the Boys don't have Murray and the Raiders should get better. But even if Randle runs a 60/40 timeshare he will probably get more carries just based on the fact that Dallas will be ahead a lot more than Oakland. And again, the Raiders have a great passing down back in Helu, so Murray will need carries to succeed.   3) Team - by far the most important aspect for starting RBs. And Randle wins this by a landslide. The Raiders had 4 fucking rushing TDs last year, and only 26 total. The Cowboys had 53, more than twice as many. Even if Randle is the backup in the timeshare he will probably get more TDs than Murray."

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,zigfried555,20,Sun Jul 19 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Brandin Cooks and Patterson are basically nothing alike. They're both good after the catch, but Cooks is WAY more polished than Patterson."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,TheVetNoob,4,Sun Jul 19 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"No doubt they are very different players and not the comparison I was making. They are very similar in the sense that their draft hype is/was through the roof with almost no resume to suggest they will/would live up to their ADP. Where Cooks is going, you basically have to assume he is going to perform at his ceiling in order to get any value from him, just like Patterson last year."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,zigfried555,6,Sun Jul 19 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"They're very in very similar situations as well.  Except, y'know, one is suddenly the #1 WR in a Drew Brees offense coming off a season where he had fewer than 6 targets only twice."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,TheVetNoob,10,Sun Jul 19 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"The funny part is that by trying to differentiate them you just convince me that they are the same.  ""Except, y'know, one is suddenly the #1 WR in a Norv Turner offense (Michael Irvin, Vincent Jackson, Josh Gordon) coming off a season where he had 9 touchdowns scored in multiple facets of the game"""
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,zigfried555,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"That is true,  but I still don't think the situations are similar. Patterson only had 400 receiving  receiving yards his first year and was still incredibly raw heading into his second."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,TheVetNoob,2,Mon Jul 20 01:19:12 2015 UTC,Most definitely not this year. That quote was the thinking last year that helped people rationalize drafting Patterson in the 4th round.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,zigfried555,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"Patterson had 3 good games at the end of the season, due in large part to his ability in the ground game. Cooks was on pace for around 900/5 and was fairly consistent in his 10 games where he got 550 yards total as the third option in that offense. Patterson never even managed that in a full 16 games, and now Cooks is almost undoubtedly going to be the number 1 guy unless Colston has a wacky resurgence. In everything aside from raw athletic ability, Cooks is a better wide receiver than Patterson, and he has an elite quarterback throwing him the ball. They're not the same in any sense other than the fact that they had hype after their rookie season."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,waffuls1,2,Mon Jul 20 03:39:29 2015 UTC,"Well glad that you agree with me on my only point of comparison that they have unwarranted hype after flashes during their rookie season. I'm looking for more of a known commodity in my late third early fourth round pick. Not a guy who had 0 100 yard games, played 2/3 of a season for a team that lost its best offensive weapon and projects to be transitioning to a run offense."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,zigfried555,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"Our difference in opinion is regarding whether or not it's unwarranted. At the third round im iffy about him but I think he's a decent pick in the fourth. Patterson's hype was based off his athletic ability. Cooks is a better route runner, has better hands, and has an elite quarterback throwing to him. In his first 10 games he did better than anything Patterson has done in a 16 game stretch despite having to work with the scraps left after Graham/Stills/Colston. Even if the Saints go more run heavy, they're not running anywhere near as much as the Vikings would have with AD."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,waffuls1,7,Mon Jul 20 05:10:31 2015 UTC,Except Cooks caught almost 80% of his passes last year and is a complete player. Besides there are lots of hyped second year players who do succeed.

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,strang3r_08,5,Sun Jul 19 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I just have a different philosophy then. There's nothing but positives for Gore besides his age, and he hasn't missed a game his last 4 seasons despite being old then too.

Not that I don't think he could put up big numbers but gore is still there and a timeshare with gore most def being on the goal line is not 4th rd material.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,sotruebro,6,Sun Jul 19 21:34:53 2015 UTC,"Uhh, Hyde won't be in a timeshare with Gore. Gore is in Indy now. Hyde will get the majority of carries in SF, though Reggie Bush will probably be in on third down."

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,strang3r_08,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"SF is going to be a terrible team this year and I worry they will be throwing from behind a lot.

I assure you they are a 9-10 win team, best case scenario they sneak into the playoffs worst case scenario finish 9-7."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,HOLIDAY_headcase,3,Sun Jul 19 20:01:12 2015 UTC,Worst case scenario is 9-7? That is hilarious.

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,MengTheBarbarian,3,Sun Jul 19 21:50:50 2015 UTC,Not touching Alshon with a 20 ft pool and grabbing him above Hilton or Cobb is ridiculous  Very real chance bears implode this season. I'll stick to players with high floors
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,bulldoozer,9,Mon Jul 20 05:29:13 2015 UTC,Bad teams can still produce good receivers.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,SayNoob,5,Sun Jul 19 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"Yes they can. But when Alshon is in the same breath as Calvin Johnson, AJ Green, etc? Just isn't worth the risk  Those players are great. Good doesn't cut it"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,bulldoozer,2,Sun Jul 19 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Also has top 5 hands in the league. He's put up 174 REC 2,554 REC YD 17 TD in two seasons as the number two receiver. He's an animal that will finally have the chance to show it. To me his situation is similar to AJ Green's and I don't think Alshon is much worse. I wouldn't be surprised to see Alshon outperform Green just due to the difference between Dalton and Cutler  In my mind he is clearly better than Cobb and Hilton."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,tgrabowy717,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:35:55 2015 UTC,Cobb and Hilton are much safer picks. Im not touching anyone on that Bears team this year
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,bulldoozer,3,Mon Jul 20 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"Hilton - ~1300 yards 7 TD; 15 games played  Cobb - ~1200 yards 12 TD; 16 games played  Jeffery - ~1100 yards 10 TD; 16 games played  Stats-wise he's pretty much around those receivers and had a significantly better season than either Hilton or Cobb the year before last (2012 for Cobb if you want to exclude his injured season in 2013). I could see an argument for not wanting him, but it's far from ridiculous."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,jshilk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that Alshon will be this year's Garbage Time MVP. I'll take him at his ADP if my other options aren't there, but I'll never feel truly comfortable about it."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,waffuls1,0,Mon Jul 20 04:20:07 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with the Bears imploding. The Bears offense could actually be one of the better ones in the league. However they will be running it more this year with this coaching staff, and with Kevin White and Eddie Royal added to the mix, I can't see Alshon being worth a top 25 pick. I'd grab him in round 3 depending on who is on the board."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Paksauce,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:52:26 2015 UTC,Except I dont see any way Cutler remains QB this entire season
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,bulldoozer,3,Mon Jul 20 06:23:13 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain to me what Dez has ever done to be warranted the #2 ranking besides catch a lot of TDs? If those TDs drop - even to 10 which would still be a lot - and his yards remain like they have his whole career, you're looking at a #8 overall finish."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,VideoGangsta,4,Mon Jul 20 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"The thing about Dez is that the TDs dont drop, and in fact they have risen every year that he has been in the league. Also, he is a very consistent player, not a player with a wide range of weekly outputs. I am not saying that Dez will score 16+ TDs, but with the departure of Demarco as a goal line threat, and Witten getting another year older, Dez will score and score frequently."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Dr_Lollygag,3,Mon Jul 20 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"Why would his TD receptions regress significantly? He's arguably the best red zone target in the league in a team with an excellent quarterback and few other red zone targets. Dez is up there for me because he's probably the safest pick after Antonio Brown. If I'm picking my WR1 and you tell me that even with significant regression on his stats, he'll still put up top 10 numbers, I will gladly take that every time. First round is for taking guys that will be the rock your team is built around, not for swinging for the fences."

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Storm_Johnson,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:08 2015 UTC,There are a lot of QBs i would rank over bradford but i dont have the option to
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,WenchSlayer,3,Mon Jul 20 12:45:54 2015 UTC,I am sorry about that. FFC has it at 6 points per passing TD so I went with FantasyPros who had Bradford at 15 when the survey came out. I do agree thought that there are other QBs better than Bradford such as Flacco and Palmer (when healthy)
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Camawei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:48 2015 UTC,Which ones?

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,snaxsnax,2,Sun Jul 19 23:25:22 2015 UTC,How is DJax unranked? And I refuse to rank Latavius Murray
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Dr_Lollygag,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:56 2015 UTC,TJ Yeldon as the 24th RB is exciting for me.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,swishnmiss41,7,Sun Jul 19 23:10:05 2015 UTC,Question here though is  are we making we did with that white dude on jax last year. Their o line is crap regardless of who plays RB. Convince me otherwise.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,PeyWey26070,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. Odds are that Yeldon is unable to perform due to the same problems that Gerhart faced. But... Yeldon is a rookie so you never really know what you're going to get. If the price is right, why not take him on a flyer?"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,IronV2,3,Sun Jul 19 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"But 24 puts him as a RB2, which isnt a flyer"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,PeyWey26070,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:43 2015 UTC,I wasn't trying to say 24 is a good price. I wouldn't touch Yeldon near there. But there is a moment for every player.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,IronV2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:18 2015 UTC,Gotcha
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,swishnmiss41,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:03 2015 UTC,The thing is people aren't taking a flyer on him. He's going pretty high. Just don't understand. I'm just trying to see if I have a wrong mode of thinking.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Dr_Lollygag,3,Mon Jul 20 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"I will try to explain a little bit at least.   TJ Yeldon was one of the more highly touted RBs to come into college in recent years, and he did nothing to show that he wasn't the amazing RB that we expected. He is constantly praised for his patience, vision, and quickness in the hole, which are extremely important characteristics for an NFL RB (These are also traits that Le'Veon Bell is noted for, and they share similar perceived weakness as well. I personally see a lot of similarities between the two). Also, Yeldon is seen as an excellent pass catcher and blocker, which will ensure that he sees the field on a regular basis. On top of this, Yeldon goes to a team that is in need of a playmaker, and there seems to be a real chance that Yeldon is the focal point of the young offense.   Important to note is that most of what I say can be argued by saying he hasnt proven any of these strengths against NFL defenses, and a dominant O-line like he had in college. Going from the best college team to one of the worst NFL teams could be a shock. Much of it comes down to truly believing in a player's talent, and I am a believer.   Hopefully this at least explains where people like me are coming from."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,PeyWey26070,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:50:14 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Anal_Vengeance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:33:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see Antonio Brown as the number 1 WR. He doesn't have the physical traits of the rest of the top-tier WRs. He won't have Bell distracting attention for 4 games. He benefited from a career-year from Big Ben. The Steelers have 2 other WRs (Bryant, Coates) who are more suited to act as the deep threat. Anyone care to explain why I should take him over Dez, Thomas, or Megatron?"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,otnormal,5,Mon Jul 20 02:13:20 2015 UTC,"Steelers fan here, Bryant and Coates are both unproven. Antonio Brown is so talented that he doesnt need the physical traits that the top receivers have. His elusiveness and quickness more than makes up for it, and id say he has the most reliable hands in the league. Before we even had Bell in our backfield  Brown was still putting up those elite stats. Last year wasnt the first time he put up big numbers, hes been doing it ever since Mike Wallace left to Miami"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Badgertime,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:32:05 2015 UTC,"Adding deep threats could arguably even make him more productive as defenses look to provide more of a cushion to try to keep up with Ben's cannon. This is where Brown makes his money in FF and the nfl by eating up defenses 4, 5, 7, 10, 12 yards at a time. I think this year will look very similar to last year for him once bell gets back"
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,otnormal,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:07 2015 UTC,I agree. I would keep in mind that the Steelers definitely have the toughest schedule in the league though. Up against a lot of tough defenses
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Guacamula,4,Sun Jul 19 23:06:32 2015 UTC,He has averaged 7.5 catches per game and 99.9 yards per game over the past two seasons. He has really strong work ethic and Ben Roethlisberger.
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Somenakedguy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Does his production the last 2 seasons not speak for itself?
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,xsvfan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:09:09 2015 UTC,How much of the results are influenced by where they are in the list when you pick?
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Cifra00,-2,Mon Jul 20 03:18:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can be wrong in how you order the top 7 receivers, but OBJ at 7 surprises me, since I'd take him over any receiver not named Antonio Brown or Julio Jones. Heck, OBJ had more receptions and scrimmage yards than Dez (reddit's #2 WR) last year, and the same insanely high TD/games played ratio of 1."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,IAmNotAPianoKey,9,Sun Jul 19 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"OBJ played without Cruz, so there's an extra mouth to feed on that offense now. Also, defenses will be honing on him more than they were last year when he was a surprise rookie.  Meanwhile, Dez is Romo's favorite red zone target (evidenced by his absurd number of TDs last year) and the Cowboys offense lost its centerpiece--Demarco Murray. Their defense isn't a whole lot better, so they have to maintain an aggressive offense. Where are those extra points going? Likely to the guy that just got an enormous new contract.  In short, OBJ's performance last season is his absolute ceiling (and it's a hell of a ceiling to be sure) whereas Dez is likely to exceed his performance last year.  Also, it's worth noting that Dez is a tried and true WR. You know what you're getting. OBJ is a bit more a wildcard because he's a rookie who has never played a full season. In my first round (and early second) I'm looking for safe bets, and I think Dez is a far safer bet--as are other proven elite WRs like Demaryius, Julio, and Jordy."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Cifra00,2,Sun Jul 19 17:58:17 2015 UTC,"IMO with Cruz they're getting a decent slot receiver back. He was never a supreme talent but he made some spectacular plays, and with the patellar tendon injury I think his physical abilities will be significantly less than what they were. It's the same reason I don't hate Jordy just because of Adams's potential. I also don't think defenses would be keying on him any more than they would at the end of last season when he'd already punched a few teams in the mouth.  I don't think you can wave around Dez's touchdowns over OBJ's when they each had a touchdown per game played. I guess, my problem is the main reason I see for Dez over OBJ is projecting that Dez should see a jump in production (due to the loss of Murray) while OBJ should see a drop in production because he only played 3/4 of a season. Seems to me that if you just take each at face value, OBJ is the better option. But that's just me.  I get the justifications and I obviously wouldn't fault anyone for Dez over OBJ, but I'm surprised that's the majority opinion given how OBJ has been nothing but phenomenal since he became a starter."

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,BenjaminStanklin,3,Sun Jul 19 20:54:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything except:   Also, defenses will be honing on him more than they were last year when he was a surprise rookie.   This is a misconception. It's not like when he was putting up back to back 100 yard games that defenses weren't aware of his production and ability . He was easily the best target available when Cruz went out - naturally there was less talent to cover at that time in the Giants' vertical offense, so OBJ attracted extra coverage from defenses. What's so striking about the guy is that he put those staggering numbers when Cruz wasn't there to help distract and defenses knew what was coming.   This year should be a bit easier for him coverage-wise if Cruz can prove that he's still a threat. If that happens, OBJ could see fewer targets, but more big plays."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,IronV2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:17 2015 UTC,He will regress to the mean. Your logic basically says that Foles should have gone really high after his crazy season .
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,Cifra00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:43:46 2015 UTC,"What mean? What baseline do we have for what OBJ will regress to? If anything is likely to regress to the mean, I think it's both Dez's and OBJ's touchdown totals, which seem more volatile year in and year out than yardage totals.  Foles was solid but had his stats buoyed by the Raiders game and a comical amount of dropped interceptions. Throw out OBJ's slaughtering of the Redskins and his totals are still off the charts. Not saying you're necessarily wrong, but OBJ's worst game since his breakout following the bye was something like 6 catches for 93 yards. I don't know what more a guy can do in 3/4 of a season to prove he's for real"

fantasyfootball,3dulm8,mtbike,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're wrong on this one man. Lacy is arguable the 1st overall pick in most leagues, while Forte is probably a late 2nd rounder."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,xxx_neo_xxx7,0,Sun Jul 19 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly think Antonio Brown should be 4 or 5. It was a total outlier year than what he's been accustomed to. Ben Roethlisberger had a ridiculous year. He was the #1 wide receiver last year, but I can't see him having that kind of an explosive year again. Possible, but unlikely.  Dez is right where he should be though if not #1 IMO. With that new contract, you can guarantee he'll be getting some serious targets from Romo. PPR leagues especially."
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,snaxsnax,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:06 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the number of td's Brown had or just in general? Because he had 1500 yards in 2013
fantasyfootball,3dulm8,xxx_neo_xxx7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:28:16 2015 UTC,Mainly TDs. His yardage will be there but I'd be surprised if he gets more than 11. I'm just unsure if it was a breakout year or what but 13 TDs last year? Jackpot.

fantasyfootball,3dy39a,goinunder0390,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:21 2015 UTC,"Well, for a long look, I wrote this nflbreakdown article on strong although that was a couple of months ago and i've only gotten lower on Strong over time. Strong just is a very plain jane receiver. He's got a lot of raw athleticism but absolutely no special football traits and that athleticism doesn't even exist in his plays. He plays football like he's a rake, almost dragging himself around sometimes and he has a very passive mentality that becomes aggressive only on one single route, the fade- but he runs that fade poorly and requires near perfect accuracy to make it catchable for him. He's very raw as a route runner although you know there's some flash here and there, there's one play that's gfy'd in the breakdown against Marcus Peters that's wild where he does a perfect double in and up on him. Strong has an insane upside if you completely ignore how he plays football, but if you watch how scared he is of using his feet or hands at the line of scrimmage, the comfort he has with pulling the ball into his chest for catches, his lack of physical play against CBs, his upside just starts to shrink. He's just not aggressive and developing aggression is going to take a lot longer than one NFL offseason. He's best suited as a timing route receiver and although i compared him to Marques Colston in that article (like i said i've only gotten lower on him) he's probably a lot closer to Malcolm Floyd of the Chargers when it comes to his ceiling."

So I was offered:  I give: forte and my 6th round pick I get: lacy and his 10th round pick  We start drafting in round 6 since we all keep 5 players. My pick is tenth overall in the 6th round
fantasyfootball,3dy39a,itsjoe49,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think I would do it. The difference between a 6th and 10th round pick is somewhat significant, but if you can keep Lacy for as long as possible, you have a RB1 for the next 5 years at least, while this is probably Forte's last good year."

fantasyfootball,3dy36c,FFBot,3,Mon Jul 20 14:02:44 2015 UTC,"Same situation but standard. 6 th pick 12 man standard, do I go Antonio Brown, or Foster? I like the second round wrs better ( Calvin, or jordy) than the second round rbs ( hill, or maybe cj) so im leaning towards foster. Thoughts?"
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,LokiKrimes,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:33 2015 UTC,"OK, with a running back like Foster you have to realize that injuries are going to happen. They just are. He's not going to make an entire season. When he's healthy, he's really good, but it's a risky pick. Brown is probably the better pick in my book. You might go Brown and Calvin first two rounds and have to pick up RB'S in later rounds. Don't be afraid of going WR-WR."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,HandsyPriest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:24:50 2015 UTC,"Definitely mock draft going WR-WR like /u/HandsyPriest said.  I'd personally Brown over Foster.  If you can't get a team you like going WR-WR and decide to go with Foster, be thinking about picking up Alfred Blue (or whoever wins the backup spot) later in the draft.  I don't trust that Foster will be able to make it through an entire season, soft tissue injuries tend to recur."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,rageaholic55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"Brown, the injury risk just makes no sense to reach for Foster at that point. You might as well go WR/WR if you don't like the second round RBs, because by taking Foster so early over a much safer talent with just as high of a ceiling you're allowing yourself to be handicapped by your draft spot."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,NannigarCire,3,Mon Jul 20 17:57:34 2015 UTC,"14 team, 4th overall pick, standard scoring. I'm 75% sure Lacy will be the guy at this spot, can someone sell me on him? Some people on this sub are talking about him as the first overall pick but I have him ranked below Peterson Bell and Charles."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,cheerio93,4,Mon Jul 20 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/ScottoGato Lacy is going to be a very consistent RB1.  He probably has the least question marks of any of the RBs you mentioned you have above him.  Peterson is going to be 30 (though he as shown us to never doubt him), Bell has a 3 game suspension, Charles randomly gets misused (occasional games with 10 or less carries).  Lacy is looking to put up his 3rd 1000+ yard season on an offense that is going to be scoring."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,rageaholic55,2,Mon Jul 20 15:01:42 2015 UTC,"There's definitely a good chance Lacy will be there (or one of those other guys you mentions drops).  He's a stud RB that really only has to worry about Starks taking points away.  Packers should have plenty of games where they are just milking clock with Lacy.  With a 14 team league, stud RBs will be worth gold."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,ScottoGato,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"the Packers score a lot and Lacy is their only goal line back, and the only back they really feature everywhere else. They averaged 30 points a game last year over the course of the season. THIRTY points. Thats inasne touchdown potential every single week for Lacy. Add the lack of stacked boxes, Rodgers featuring Lacy as a checkdown back, the floor is high, the ceiling is high, everything on Lacy is high."

fantasyfootball,3dy36c,DrunkenMonkey03,3,Mon Jul 20 14:18:58 2015 UTC,"Antoino Brown. Over the last two years the lowest score Brown has put up in your scoring is 7.7, on Week 2 of 2013. Brown has had one game under 5 catches with 60 yards since 2012. His usage is unmatched by any other WR because the Steelers are committed to having him keep his record of most consecutive games with 5 catches. Foster's injury risk is nowhere near worth losing that kind of floor/ceiling."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,NannigarCire,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:31 2015 UTC,I'm always fearful of Foster's durability.  Brown seems like a good candidate for consistent production at a high level.

fantasyfootball,3dy36c,BenjaminStanklin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"Jarvis Landry is my pick. Stills and Parker don't affect Landrys targets (and Parker has enough issues in his game to potentially be a non-factor in his first year anyway), and he's the only returning receiver from last years group, so he's already got the chemistry with Tannehill. Landry had like, 77 catches in only 12 games starting as a rookie? That was competing with other targets that Tannehill was actually comfortable with too. It shouldn't be hard for him to eclipse 100/1000 this year and early in the season he should see enough volume to potentailly be overvalued and traded for something big."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"A little context here: 12 team league standard scoring, we decide our draft our by a weighted lottery for pick selection determined by points scored. Basically most points scored has 12 ""ping pong balls"" and best chance for the right to choose first. I got chosen 5th and picks 1-4 are already taken. So I'm debating between just going with 5th pick or getting the wrap around at 12 and 13. Last year I traded out of the first round (pick 11) and ended up with 6 picks from 21-52. This depth strategy worked well and I had the best team and won the league. So I'm stuck debating wether or not to go for depth again at 12,13 or go for a top rb at 5."

fantasyfootball,3dy36c,rageaholic55,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:51 2015 UTC,Thanks I'm definitely leaning 12-13 with wr-wr
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,jdodge555,0,Mon Jul 20 18:29:13 2015 UTC,"5 is too low for a top RB. At that point you're likely settling for Bell on a 3 game suspension, which is a great way to lose your league if you start off 0-3 because of it. If you're up for taking Antonio Brown there, you're safe, but if you're committed to grabbing a RB then you move back and gather picks."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:28 2015 UTC,yeah i totally agree about bell 3 game suspension plus the bye week is 4 out of 13 games gone which is crazy for a top 5 pick
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,jdodge555,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yahoo standard draft. 12 man league.  I'm going to be picking 9th this year in a snake draft. My draft isn't for quite awhile yet, but I wanted someone else's perspective. I have a good idea of who I am looking to get the first two rounds (probably going to go Dez and Julio/ Megatron). Third round I'm kind of struggling who I want to take. All the players around that ADP I'm not too hyped about.  Right now, in mock drafts I've been taking K. Benjamin, but analysts are talking like he's not going to do as well. I've also been looking at Gore, Lamar Miller, Gordon, or Hopkins. What are your thoughts, guys?"
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,HandsyPriest,3,Mon Jul 20 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"I think the 3rd round has some great value at RBs. You're not going to get the combination of ceiling and consistency of a 1st or 2nd round RB, but there's a good crop this year. Assuming you go WR/WR, I'd be happy with Ingram, Morris, Miller, and Forsett or Gore if they drop. If you can get one of those guys late 3rd and Miller in the 4th, which has been happening to me in the mocks i've been doing, you'll be golden. I wouldn't swing on Benji or Hopkins if I had Dez/Calvin, the WR class is deep enough that you could recoup the cost later, which I couldn't say for RBs."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,BenjaminStanklin,3,Mon Jul 20 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"I'm taking Gore. Gore's 1206 yards away from being a top 10 RB all time in rushing yardage, you better believe the Colts know that. He's on a team that utilizes RBs heavily in the passing game and is top 3 in scoring, that's tons of scoring opportunities. Gore hasn't slowed down at all with age, he's hit 1100 yards the last two seasons."
fantasyfootball,3dy36c,NannigarCire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:48:19 2015 UTC,"This never occurred to me, solid thought.  I was down on Gore due to his age and Colts inability to run the ball.  However, Pep loves to run and this is an interesting tidbit."

I'm a little scared of Hyde -- there's always one back who projects to break out but busts and he could be it. His per-carry stats last year weren't great and Niners o-line got worse. Plus there's a lot of talent behind him.   Gurley and Yeldon are pretty interchangeable, just depends on which one you want to risk taking. Gurley has the injury concerns (as well as a potential split with Mason) but Yeldon is on maybe one of the worst offenses in the league.  To me, Watkins is talented, but his situation could not be worse. I have no idea who is throwing him the ball, and neither of those QBs are good anyways. In addition, Rex Ryan is huge on running the ball, and they have a couple good backs that make me think they will be extremely run-happy. I'd avoid him if at all possible."

Detroit will have lots of scoring opportunities and I can see Abdullah getting many touches over the banged up aging and somewhat pedestrian incumbent
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Biggie2207,3,Mon Jul 20 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"I think Bell will still be the primary back for most of the season unless Abdullah is really impressive.  Bell hasn't been an upper-echelon back but he did finish as the #14 RB last year in ESPN standard, and finished #22 in 2013 when playing primarily as a backup. I'm not too concerned about his age because he's still on the good side of 30 and only has 610 career touches (much less than your typical 28 year old RB).  As for whether they'll have a lot of scoring opportunities, I hope that's the case, but they were not an especially productive offense last year.  And Joique is still more than likely going to be the red zone guy, as he has been for the last two years."

Thing is, Joique has been solid (not many fumbles, reliable) and Theo Riddick did great in passing situations, so until he picks up the playbook at max capacity AND outshines, i cant see him wrestling away a lot of time...   dont get me wrong, i want the guy on my team, i'm just not investing anything higher than 7th round if possible.

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,PrinceAli311,3,Mon Jul 20 05:14:40 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely happy about the feedback on this thread. Gives me a lot of food for thought.
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,4x49ers,6,Mon Jul 20 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"DGB. He is a freak of an athlete and has Mariota throwing him the ball. sigh another amazing receiver the 49ers missed out on (look at you, ODBJ from last year)."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,PrinceAli311,3,Mon Jul 20 03:27:25 2015 UTC,"Mariota still needs to sign, and it's not very heartening to see a 6'5 WR who refuses to play physical against press coverage, he just disappears. He has great highlights, but below average game footage. Plus his off the field issues, especially allegations of violence against women, would make me nervous to pick his as a keeper."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,4x49ers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:52 2015 UTC,I hope your assessment of him is right.
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,PrinceAli311,2,Mon Jul 20 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"I hope he proves me wrong actually, I'd love to see him mature both as a player and a man, but if I were drafting today I wouldn't touch him. You can still get guys like Q well after him and I'd rather have a high floor low ceiling guy, personally."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,cowmandude,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:41:14 2015 UTC,"I, of course, hope you're right a out him in regards to his success. I'd never wish ill on a player. I meant more, I hope you were right about us not taking the risk on him and hope that our guys end up panning out.   I'm in the opposite boat though where I would have loved a high ceiling guy because I think we don't have enough of those, but then again, who knows. So many unprovens on our team.  Edit: sorry for grammar/spelling. I'm in the gym and posting in a rush."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,PeyWey26070,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:08:34 2015 UTC,Just to be clear....his off the field issues are that he got caught with a POUND of pot(about 450 grams for the drug users who did bad in math) and he allegedly pushed his girlfriend down a flight of stairs. This has Josh Gordon written all over it.
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,ajr0525,2,Mon Jul 20 14:42:36 2015 UTC,So a great thing this year terrible for next year?

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,voodoodudu,4,Sun Jul 19 23:01:22 2015 UTC,Lacy was drafted into the best possible scenario for a RB. Gordon doesn't have the same qb or oline as lacy

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Mycotoxicjoy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"I think you meant Gordon instead of Ingram? He and Gurley (assuming his knee is 100%) really do have the best shots at producing RB2/1 numbers. For the WRs, aside from Cooper both Agholor and Perriman will get plenty of opportunities to shine. That said, don't base your expectations on last year's WR class, which a lot of analysts are saying was historic. It may be that no one from this draft class 'blows up' in their first year since most rookies take at least a full season to adjust to the speed and physicality of the NFL."

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:41:21 2015 UTC,I'm gonna say Buck Allen might seize the starting role if Forsett struggles or goes down to injury. He can do everything in Trestman's offense making him a viable 3 down option
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,thefantasydraw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"My money is on Nelson Agholor. No one will have a ""Beckham-like"" season, but he's my bet to get the closest. He's as pro ready as any WR in the draft, and the situation he landed in has crazy upside potential. No secrets, but Cooper and Melvin Gordon are the next rookies to watch."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:18:57 2015 UTC,It's not like Riley Cooper will be the starter

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Getupboi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, gotcha. Jordan Matthews should see most of his time in the slot, so there are 2 outside WR positions up for grabs between Agholor, Riley Cooper, Josh Huff, and Miles Austin... Agholor should run away with one of those spots easily."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,thefantasydraw,2,Tue Jul 21 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Austin is a camp body. Huff they expect to take a bit of a leap forward even though he was poor as a rookie. While Matthews did a lot of damage in the slot last season I would expect both Matthews and Ertz to line up outside (they want him on field and with the questions on the oline Celek will be asked to block again) on occasion and maybe even some Sproles in the slot. Cooper seems to be starting because of his blocking ability but the Maclin spot outside is up for grabs.   What I am trying to say is I don't expect one player to see his targets, it will be split between a number of different guys. Agholor does have huge upside but I expect the ball to be spread around"
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Getupboi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"I think although their ADP is rapidly rising, you just can't ignore Gordon and Gurley. Running backs don't just get selected in the first round for nothing. Both of these guys have elite talent that can't be overlooked. If they are playing, expect good results. They are just that talented."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Barian_Fostate,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:51 2015 UTC,"Gurley is the kind of back who could prove me wrong, but he's coming back from injury and the Rams have a mean schedule against the run (from what we can tell in July). For redraft I think it will just be too little, too late for Gurley to top the rookie list in 2015."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,abtar_kerpal,2,Mon Jul 20 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but just as you said, he's the type of back to prove you wrong. He's just such a talented back."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,DADDYS_DARLING,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:34:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely Tevin Coleman imo. I think he puts up pro bowl numbers right out of the gate.
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,donnylong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:27:27 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of rookies that I'm just waiting to see how they fit in the offense. It's natural for us fantasy players to jump on the young players' bandwagon, especially because of the young talent in recent years. However, not everyone blows up their first year. Most don't.   DGB is in a crowded receiver corp with Wright, Hunter, Hakeem, and Harry Douglas. Not that these are the best receivers, but add a rookie QB and this is definitely something to keep an eye on in the preseason  Perrimen has less competition with the departure of Torrey Smith. So expect him to see play time, but do not sleep on Marlon Brown.  Agholor is in a great system that also just lost their top receiver. Mathews, Riley Cooper, Miles Austin, and sleeper Josh (Willie James) Huff. Not the best receivers again but throw in a crowded back field, 2 TE's and a QB position in ?'s and this is something to watch. Though I'm pretty confident in Aghlors chance in playtime, not sure how consistent he'll be.  Davante Parker is coming off foot surgery and is in a crowded corp too. Landry, Stills, and Jennings.   Devin Funchess is probably my favorite out of the mentioned (still like Cooper + White better). Benjamin looks like he could be heading towards a sophomore slump with his weight and hamstring issues. Enter Funchess with a Benjamin-like build. He'll compete with Cotchery, Ted Gin Jr., Boykin, and Stephen Hill for time. Not to mention Cam should be healthier this year.   As for RBs, Abdullah has been hyped up, but will compete with Joique (don't forget about Theo!) Wanna see how Duke fits in the West Crow backfield in Cleveland. If Coleman and Cobb can win their jobs. And how Gurley's health is."

fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,BenjaminStanklin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:08:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about OBJ levels of production, but here are my thoughts about my top two rookie RBs.  Gordon: Love the back, love the situation. I rewatched his snaps against LSU to see how he really looked against athletic defenders with size, and I loved what I saw. He doesn't have great top end speed, but his first five steps are extremely quick, he weaves well, and has good vision.  Coleman: He's one of the best big-play backs to come out of college in a few years, and he's got good size, which is unusual for big play guys. Shanahan's zone scheme makes running backs look good, and his aquiesance with Coleman being drafted leads me to believe he thinks Coleman will fit in the system. He's probably going to be in a time share to start out, but his ability to get chunk yardage negates some of that downside. There's something to be said for running backs that produce at the level that he did in college with a very subpar supporting cast."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:21:59 2015 UTC,"Indiana's offensive line was one of the better lines in the Big Ten. Their QB situation was bad after they lost four starting QBs in 8 months (it's true - look it up). But ""very subpar"" is not totally accurate. Below average, maybe, but even with the injuries at QB, they were damn near a bowl team."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,jdr393,2,Mon Jul 20 12:10:25 2015 UTC,"Totally agree on coleman. Love the way he runs and Shanny's running scheme should ease him in to a RB1 role if he shows he's capable of playing well at the NFL level. I've been grabbing him as an RB3, which is feels like a good risk given his ceiling if I can grab 2 dependable RBs ahead of him."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:14 2015 UTC,"At RB, I think everyone knows the obvious answer is TJ Yeldon.... Or maybe that is just me. Also, if Todd Gurley is even ready to go for 8 weeks of the season, I think he is going to have a huge 8 weeks.   At WR, the guy with the largest immediate ceiling is Kevin White in my opinion. He has all of the tools of a WR1, and will be on a team that will be trailing a lot and lacks a WR2. I think that Cooper and Parker will both produce early and often once they hit the field, but I just think White has the best chance to have an Odell-like year if I had to pick one."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,ODBrunizz,5,Mon Jul 20 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"As a Bears fan, Kevin White has a few things going against him in my opinion. John Fox is notorious for keeping rookies off the field. His route running is raw. There are three legitimate players catching balls ahead of him (Alshon, Martellus, Forte).  I think he is going to be a great player long term, but I think his rookie season will be far less productive than Amari Cooper (who I also feel has a similar top 5 WR upside).   100000% agree with you on Yeldon. I am always shocked at how far down the draft board he goes."
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,Dr_Lollygag,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:35 2015 UTC,"After I typed it, I did begin to think that maybe White's incompleteness in comparison to Cooper might hold him back, but other than that I just don't think any coach can hold them back if they prove that they are truly gifted. Agreed on Cooper though, I am just not sure in his rookie year for the Raiders that he can quickly get to his peak. I'm imagining Cutler just bombing em to White regardless of coverage and him coming up big.   Love the Yeldon support, people around here are pretty against his current price. Maybe they have reason to be, but I am far on the other side.    Thanks for the input as a Bears fan!"
fantasyfootball,3dvh9k,ODBrunizz,2,Mon Jul 20 02:26:09 2015 UTC,obvious answer is TJ Yeldon   Apparently not since you're the only one that mentioned him.   I am inclined to agree with you though.  He is a true lead back with no RBBC threat in an offense bound and determined to be better.  They actually have some passing weapons and a young QB.  What better way to support a young ascending QB than running the ball?

fantasyfootball,3dvi6h,PNBest,17,Sun Jul 19 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"We still have no idea how WR will shake out in Minnesota. Mike Wallace and Charles Johnson are the presumed starters, yet only Wallace's spot is secure. Johnson has competition from Patterson for the other starting spot. Assuming Johnson wins out, Patterson, Jarius Wright, and rookie Stephon Diggs will all compete for the slot roll. At this point, we can't say much more without training camp and eventual preseason games.  At RB, we all know Peterson will start, but it remains to be seen how often Jerrick McKinnon will get carries, or if Matt Asiata will stay relevant in goal line situations. I doubt Asiata will vulture many touchdowns from Peterson, but I wouldn't be surprised.   At TE, Kyle Rudolph is locked in at starter. How long he starts before being injured remains to be seen. Rhett Ellison is mostly a run blocking TE / H Back and is irrelevant to fantasy, even if he is considered the official #2 TE. If/when Rudolph goes down, the pass catching TE threats will be between Chase Ford and rookie Mycole Pruitt (probably messed up his first name, but that's how it's pronounced). I wouldn't worry about either of these guys unless something happens to Rudolph.  Meanwhile, you can fully expect Teddy Bridgewater to have a 5000 yard, 30 TD season."

There's a CBS podcast in which they discuss whether his role is more downfield like his earlier days or if he's more of a short-mid yard guy like last year. I think Johnson is more of the downfield guy on that team. I'm expecting a solid 75-950-6 from him this year. That puts him at 206 on the year (ppr) and around 13 a game."

Stacy might vulture a TD every now and then but that'll just be hurting Ivory. If Ivory and/or Ridley go down (both fair chances) Stacy could be a solid fill in on your team."
fantasyfootball,3dvi6h,Forty-Three,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:43:51 2015 UTC,"Saints:  Starting RB will be Ingram, with Spiller and Robinson coming in for change-of-pace or when Ingram is tired. Ingram's the back to have, strong RB2, with Spiller being a flex play or an RB2 in a PPR league.  WR: Colston & Cooks starting, likely to see Nick Toon as the #3, although he'll likely line up outside with Cooks in the slot. Also, for deeper leagues, watch out for Brandon Coleman or Seantavius Jones to emerge later on in the season, or possibly in the beginning if one of the aforementioned three gets injured."

It's probably of less interest for bigger pots, but championships are right before Christmas and it made sense for one league I was in where I placed for $100.  This year leaguesafe is charging a 3% fee to start with. IMO, not really a big deal to keep track of the money and make it simple for everyone, but it's worth noting."

For a guy that averaged about 1,400/11 in 2012 and 2013, I think ppl are a little low on him this year due to a crowded tier of elite WRs. That's fine by me as I expect he'll regain his statistical form. He's also one of the reasons I really like drafting at an early spot this year because he's usually there in the late 2nd/early 3rd which is good value. Dalton won't wow you, but he's still capable of running an offense that puts up solid fantasy numbers and while Hue Jackson does prefer to establish the run, Green is still one of the elite WRs in the NFL and should get his fair share. I'm drafting him with the expectation of about 1,300/10."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,UnoDosThrace,6,Sun Jul 19 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right when you infer that the first three picks in the draft are where you want to be this year, because of the talent that's left for you at the 2/3 turn.  I'm picking #1 in my league with the biggest buy-in. I'n all of my mocks, I've been getting such good value at 20 and 21 that it should be stealing.  1: Highest RB on your board (Anderson for me.)  20 and 21: Two of Hill, Jordy, Green, occasionally Julio, Alshon, etc."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,SaltyMagician,19,Sun Jul 19 19:50:28 2015 UTC,If Anderson is your number one RB why wouldn't you personally want to pick towards the end of the round like 7/8 where you could still get him?
fantasyfootball,3dukru,zimmeli,7,Sun Jul 19 20:23:52 2015 UTC,Because then I don't get the same caliber of player in round three. The whole point is getting 3 picks in before the talent drops off at 22-24.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,SaltyMagician,28,Sun Jul 19 20:28:41 2015 UTC,So you're taking CJ Anderson with the 1st pick?
fantasyfootball,3dukru,THA-HINRICH-MANEUVER,8,Sun Jul 19 20:39:05 2015 UTC,"Why would you take anyone other than your top player #1? The only situation I can think of would be one where you think you can get him later, and he explicitly stated that he felt CJ wouldn't last until the 2nd round and it's not like there isn't a case for CJ #1. I understand there's a counter case, but the same can be said for others that are accepted as top picks."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,eme_pirrade,10,Sun Jul 19 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"I believe it's harder to shut down arguments against other picks than there is of Anderson. The issue with Anderson is if he goes down it's over. Too man hawks on the field. If Charles goes down well he'll come back, Foster goes down he'll come back, Marshawn down comes back. Everyone will come back because they're the lead back. But in Denver Lead back can change in an instant. They are truly the next man up when in come to running backs. That alone hurts his case for number one overall.   If you take a RB number one you want his cuff and you can't cuff three other dudes.   To each there own but the first overall has to be the safest pick of them all. You have everyone at your disposal and taking something risky that early is giving everyone else and advantage."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,BagelsAndJewce,2,Mon Jul 20 00:20:16 2015 UTC,"I've never really bought the concept of safe picks at RB. You're essentially playing with fire once they turn 28 or so. Once they've had time to prove themselves, they're old for RBs. I don't see it as avoiding a swing for the fences if you're taking CJ, because you're swinging for the fences no matter who you take.  Granted, there are many reasonable arguments against CJ Anderson. Looking for reasons he may bust is essentially the same thing I'm (or anyone is) doing when I identify busts. For example, my argument against Matt Forte. I don't know, I feel CJ Anderson is the correct answer for who to take number one, but in all likelihood I'm wrong. What's exciting about fantasy football is that I'll either be validated and feel really smart, or be proven wrong and look super dumb."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,eme_pirrade,4,Mon Jul 20 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"Can you trade draft picks in your league? If so, why not trade the #1 overall to someone in the middle of the first for their 5-7 overall and whatever else they'll give you? If someone really wants Demarco or charles or forte or someone at 1:1, they might be willing to throw you a pretty significant pick to move up those spots. If you can't trade picks, I'd try to work something out to do the same thing but just immediately after the draft"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,swim_swim_swim,2,Mon Jul 20 01:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think you replied to the wrong guy, but I absolutely agree. Moving down to get CJ is the optimal strategy if you can do it."

I'll be taking Adrian Peterson, but if there is anybody within that 1st 2 rounds that I want, I have to take them at 1.

fantasyfootball,3dukru,blblann,4,Sun Jul 19 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"I think both are due to regress due to age and wear and tear, and Anderson was insanely productive last year. Insert Gary Kubiak, who can get middling RB's to produce gaudy numbers, and I think you have the recipe for a rushing champion."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,SaltyMagician,4,Sun Jul 19 22:01:56 2015 UTC,Anderson hasn't even won the starting job under Kubiak. Montee Ball could be the starting RB by Week 3-4 if Kubiak sees him as a better fit for his offense. Remember the old coaching doesn't owe any of these RBs.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,tzimme4,2,Sun Jul 19 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"I've watched just about every one of Ball and Anderson's regular season snaps, and I cannot imagine a universe where Ball beats CJ out.   However--and thank you for calling my attention to this, I should have included it--I am taking Ball a round before his ADP in every league, even those where I don't get Anderson. The reasoning is that Kubiak's running backs produce as a rule, so if CJ goes down, or somehow fumbles away the job, I think Ball can step right in and produce at a similar, albeit slightly lower, rate."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,SaltyMagician,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:28 2015 UTC,I watched everything Ball did last year too and I think his ability or lack there of is hugely overstated. He played hard and was good after contact. Clearly Anderson passed the eye test but Ball is talented and a competitor. Ball could be the starter on day one for all we know.   Personally I like the risk of taking Anderson with a first round pick though. Swing for the fences.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bananapanther,0,Mon Jul 20 03:19:17 2015 UTC,"Ball is not talented.  Love, guy who took Ball at  pick 13 last year."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,punchingsmurphs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"Not the OP but he's on a team with Peyton Manning, historically this means the starting RB will finish top 10 in fantasy scoring.   This is obviously due to the defence focusing on the passing game and the high number of snaps in the red zone his rbs get. CJ Anderson killed it last year and safely banking on him getting 800-1000 rushing yards, 300-400 receiving yards and 10-16 TD's.   Players like Peterson, Charles are definitely better all around running backs and barring injury (which is a big thing to talk about, Peterson's 30 and the chiefs know Knile Davis can produce meaning a small injury might sit him out easier then last year) could quite likely finish first over all in Fantasy points, how ever there teams offence's are both much worse then the Bronco's, and won't get the red zone chances while being a heavier focus for the defence"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,racoonx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"Just so we're clear, that means top 10 among running backs - not top 10 in fantasy, right?  If I'm reading the article correctly, it just means that he's worth being a RB#1 for someone.   If we assume Anderson will finish fifth among RB's (the second-highest a Manning RB has finished since 2000), you have to figure Peterson and Charles will be two of the guys most likely ahead of him."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Clovdyx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:41:42 2015 UTC,"Historically drafting an RB in the first rounds about a 50/50 gamble it pays off, Anderson seems to be a lock for top 5 in RB fantasy points with a lot less risk then any of the other top 5 backs (Better across the big three; age, team, past injury's). If Lynch, Lacey, Peterson, Charles and Lacy play all games healthy and don't regress they'll realistically all finish a head of Anderson by 5%-15%, but I would bet dollars to donuts only 2-3 of them truck it thru the entire season.   Anderson won't finish as the top RB, but you can count on him finishing in the top 5, security's a hell of a thing"

That said - I'd try to swing a deal where you move back in the 1st.  Like #1 overall for #5 overall and a 10th round pick.  Or #1 overall + your 8th for #5 overall and a 6th.  Best way to capture that value.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,clutchmasterflex,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:42 2015 UTC,Taking Anderson 1 would be a dumb move.  You need to trade down to 6-8 and take him there.

fantasyfootball,3dukru,swishnmiss41,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:48:23 2015 UTC,Those stats came when Dalton put up top 5 fantasy numbers. That ain't happening again. Not with Hill being featured. Green in 2nd is NOT good value
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,2,Sun Jul 19 22:19:05 2015 UTC,He was on pace for 1500 yards and 10 td's last year despite Dalton's horrid play
fantasyfootball,3dukru,dawnofhammer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"In terms of pure talent I think Green is second to only Megatron. Call whatever tie you want with Brown and Julio. He's limited by his QB more than the other top WR's, but he is a damn good receiver. I would be glad to have him as my WR1."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,The_Wac,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:35 2015 UTC,Green is second to only Megatron. Call whatever tie you want with Brown and Julio.   Dez?
fantasyfootball,3dukru,jjp36,3,Mon Jul 20 01:35:50 2015 UTC,Oh shit right. Well that complicates things.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,The_Wac,0,Mon Jul 20 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"As a bengals fan I agree, he is just a monster when healthy and has been our entire offense for two years"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,0,Mon Jul 20 01:23:28 2015 UTC,Why the hell do you think Dalton put up top 5 fantasy numbers? Probably because he was throwing to a healthy AJ Green.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,sexytoddlers,0,Mon Jul 20 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"True, and he had an easy schedule.... and in a pass heavy offense.... two things that wont be the case this year"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,4,Mon Jul 20 18:48:27 2015 UTC,Simply he's being way undervalued. Take him late 2nd-early 3rd and laugh about it. You got a potential top 5 stud for cheap.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Rayman13,14,Sun Jul 19 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Taken in the third last year in most drafts? Are you high? He was drafted as a top 5 wr late first round/early second. I would love to have Green on my team in the late second this year. I can easily see him going ahead of Murray, McCoy, Luck, and Rodgers if you believe in waiting on a qb and are unsure of the situation those RBs are in (both coming off heavy use seasons, New offense, PHI with lots of talented RBs, BUF with a terrible O-line and QB)"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,zigfried555,7,Sun Jul 19 18:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm so tired of ppl making up BS stats that could easily be googled.

fantasyfootball,3dukru,Birdgang14,8,Sun Jul 19 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"In the many mocks that I have done AJ Green is going in the mid second. The difference might be that I focus on PPR while maybe you're doing standard, but I have never seen Green in the 3rd.   No one is doubting his talent, but he has a QB that limits his ceiling, and a coach focused on running the ball."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Dr_Lollygag,0,Sun Jul 19 17:06:03 2015 UTC,"Green mid 2nd IMO is insane, I think ppr may be the difference there"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,3,Sun Jul 19 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm taking Green ahead of Jordy/Cobb, Luck/Rodgers and even ODB. Hes one of the best receivers in football. Dalton isn't a world beater, but hes competent enough. He is my go to guy in the back end of the second round. I don't really understand why people are so low on him. Hes a true top tier fantasy receiver, but somehow hes being drafted as a borderline #1."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,SayNoob,4,Sun Jul 19 19:33:21 2015 UTC,Only thing I disagree on is Jordy. I think he's a better fantasy receiver. Scores long touchdowns like no other.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Thunder-ten-tronckh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"Hip surgery, his age, Cobb, and Adams' increasing role.  I like Jordy too, but there is a good argument for AJ."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,sexytoddlers,5,Mon Jul 20 16:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think he is due for a huge season. He's coming into a contract season after having a letdown year. Also my Bengals were missing their #2 WR Marvin Jones all season last year, as well as receiving TE Tyler Eifert. These guys were supposed to get a lot of looks and draw the d away from Green.  Jeremy Hill also exploded onto the NFL scene last year and with both him and Gio in the backfield, defenses will have to respect the run game.  For all these reasons I think Green will have a monster year. The only thing that will stop him could be injuries. He had turf toe last year, and that can come back at any time.   Edit: of the players listed I would take Jordy over him every time too. I would take Green over everyone else though (although I do not do early QB - if you go that way I'd take Luck or Rodgers over him)."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,brewlliant,2,Sun Jul 19 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"2014 ADP 14 overall, 2.02, not 3rd round.  (4th wr off the board)  2012 finish: wr4 overall.    2013 finish: wr4 overall.  30 points ahead of jordy.  Missed time with injuries last season for first time in career.  So late 2nd his value is insane, as a proven top 5 finisher multiple seasons, especially now with gresham gone."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Storm_Johnson,0,Sun Jul 19 21:11:27 2015 UTC,Bengals offense completely different now though. Pass much less. Those numbers came when Dalton put up top 5 fantasy numbers
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:26 2015 UTC,"2012 he wasnt top 5, i believe he was qb12.  2013 he finished top 5.  But he was averaging a crazy number of attempts those years.  his attempts dropped last year but he also lost eifert, lost marvin jones, gio missed time, AJ was out for 4 games but really didnt play in 6 games.  i think that the emergence of hill and a healthy marvin jones are going to help green.  with a healthy squad, dalton's attempts should increase from last year.  we'll see, but bottom line if i had an early pick and AJ was there in 2nd, I'm taking him."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Storm_Johnson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:12:58 2015 UTC,I think he is an absolute steal in the draft! he has had one ad season because he was banged up pretty well. People will also say that the QB is horrible but he truly isnt that bad. He is at least good enough to get Green the ball.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,poli7667,0,Sun Jul 19 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"When did he have a bad season? He missed a few games last year, but led all WRs in fantasy points per target."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:03 2015 UTC,Absolute beast when he plays.  People are afraid of the injuries but he'll be back and ready to go.  Snag him at a good value when you can.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,jreaston,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Bengals fan here. Without question a tier 1 WR in fantasy (my top tier is about 11 deep) but on the lower end. Concerns are an offense shifting towards a running focus and having an inconsistent QB. Pros are he should receive less coverage than last year with healthier WRs.   In terms of fantasy I would say he is a small gap behind Dez, Julio, OBJ, Brown, and Thomas. Would put Calvin above him and put green around Cobb/Hilton territory, but above Alshon. Everyone wants a top 10 WR on their team... Green is strong but not my first choice or close to it"
fantasyfootball,3dukru,bulldoozer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:14:43 2015 UTC,"The guy is as solid as they come, puts his head down and plays and even on a down 2014 he still topped 1000 yards, he's an elite receiver that you could get on sale come draft day."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Newm4n,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:22 2015 UTC,"I think a lot can be said about why AJ deserves that mid-second round ADP. He will be 100% healthy this season. Injuries last season really hurt his numbers but he still 1,000 yards and 4 TDs. So, when he's healthy he is definitely a top WR.  Also, he's entering a contract year. He told the Bengals he is willing to wait until after this season to negotiate. He wants his play to do the talking for him, so he can focus on this season. If he performs to the like of 1,200 and 10 or so, then he will get the money that Dez and Thomas just got."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,BrostinChurchill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:29 2015 UTC,I would take him before any other wide receiver other than Brown.
fantasyfootball,3dukru,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:03 2015 UTC,"I just posted my rankings in another thread, I have him as the number 3 WR behind Brown and Julio. Green is a freak, he played on one foot for most of the year with the Bengals number 2 WR (Jones) out for the season and put up over 1000 yards. Dalton basically just has to throw it up to him and he can turn a jump ball into a 70 yard TD.   I think the top 5 guys are probably interchangeable, however I think Brown is the safest out of sheer targets.   Julio should put up the same numbers and has room for improvement   Green should be healthy which should mean monster numbers   Dez will get his targets but the Cowboys relied on that run game heavily last year, Romo throwing more balls could mean anything with the shape his body is in  Thomas has Peyton who struggled at the end of last year with injury but is awesome after the catch so he should still put up decent numbers."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,Nightmanz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely undervalued considering his body of work to this point. Missed 3 games last season and still posted a 1,000 yard season and 6 TD's. I believe a healthy AJ returns to form and pulls off something in the neighborhood of 1350 yards and 9 TD's. With that being said, I still like Dez, Julio, and DT (kind of) over him, then it's AJ, Jordy, Calvin, OBJ (if healthy), Alshon, etc."
fantasyfootball,3dukru,moonftball12,0,Mon Jul 20 17:43:00 2015 UTC,"I'm avoiding him this year. If he drops I'll take him, but those foot injuries have a way of lingering for entire careers."

fantasyfootball,3dukru,Birdgang14,4,Sun Jul 19 20:28:18 2015 UTC,Any player would have durability issues with the way Dalton hangs his receivers out to dry.

fantasyfootball,3dukru,new-money,0,Sun Jul 19 18:43:52 2015 UTC,"Okay maybe not 12 but aside from the studs I would probably take Cobb,  Hilton, Jeffrey and maybe even Evans ahead of Green.   He was just boom or bust for me.   And he missed a lot of time during games for hits that didn't look bad (I know this is easy to say sitting on my couch) but compared to other receivers,  Green just isn't as big and tough as other top  wide outs."

I think Green is a top 3 WR but he is in the worst fantasy situation among everyone in the top 10 with his offense and QB  Green is damn good in fantasy but he isn't money by any stretch. Very boom or bust and all signs point to that continuing. Top tier guy, but on bottom end"
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,jacob2815,7,Sun Jul 19 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Too many questions for his ADP. Is he gonna get red zone carries? Or will Gerhart get those? Also will he split time with Robinson, because he was pretty good last season as well. He's also playing on the Jags, they may not be as bad as before, but they still have a second year QB and a bad line.   I'd take him if he fell a few rounds and I already have my starting receivers and RBs locked up."
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,KrustyBeaver,8,Sun Jul 19 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"he's kinda got a Bishop Sankey 2014 thing going for him.  As in, shit offense, being drafted purely for expected usage and volume.    we should have a better idea after the pre season starts."

fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,snapcracklePOPPOP,3,Mon Jul 20 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"Jags fan here. I honestly don't see him fairing well. We have a lot of new pieces on the line, which while could improve it, will take time to mesh. He'll be splitting carries with at least 2 other guys, though to what extent nobody has any clue. We have a new OC and line coach so our run game this year is anyone's guess. Well likely have 4 backs on the roster so plenty of opportunity for others to steal his carries. On top of that, I haven't been impressed with the tape I saw on him. He isn't especially fast (I think he ran around a 4.6 iirc) and runs very upright. Add to that the jags uncanny ability to have all their RBs constantly injured, and I wouldn't put a whole lot of faith in him. Everyone expected Gerhart to get a lot of carries and do well last year and got burned, likely will with Yeldon too. That said he was drafted to be a 3 down back and will likely start with DRob as a change of pace guy and Toby filling more of a FB or HB role. If i were to bet he'll likely end up around RB3 or flex level guy"
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,doodwhersmycar,9,Mon Jul 20 02:46:58 2015 UTC,I'd draft him in the 5th or later.  He's definitely worth a shot.  Especially if you don't have to start him and can wait and see if he does work.
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,BenjaminStanklin,3,Sun Jul 19 21:42:58 2015 UTC,Yeldons floor pretty low due to questions in the offense and poaching by Robinson and Gerhart. This will get some hate but IMO Blount has a higher ceiling and a higher floor and you can get him in the 7th. I just don't see 5th or even 6th round value in Yeldon
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,SovietRussiaSam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"I agree on Blount, but I disagree gerhart and Robinson poach. Maybe as a change of pace, but Yeldon has feature back tools. Gerhart is terribly inefficient and Robinson is brittle. Yeldon pushes for 200+ carries imo."
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,BenjaminStanklin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:06:32 2015 UTC,I've seen him go late 4th to mid 5th in 12 man standard leagues. I assume by starter you mean a team's respective WR1/RB1. Plenty go later than the 4th round.
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,IronV2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:33:08 2015 UTC,"Weird, I haven't seen him go later than mid 4th. Aside from Yeldon, which other starting RB's go later than the 4th?"
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,SayNoob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that all of these guys are necessarily worth it but Jonathan Stewart (if you're lucky), Rashad Jennings, Doug Martin, Joique Bell, Isaiah Crowell, Chris Ivory, and Bishop Sankey all come to mind. Out of those, I like Stewart, Jennings, Crowell, and Ivory. Some of them might not have the same potential workload given that they're in a RBBC, but I think they'll outperform their ADP and it answers your question."
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,superdude523,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:58:53 2015 UTC,He should definitely not be drafted as early as the fourth. He has two other guys to split carries with. Gerhart might be the 3rd down guy or short yardage. Robinson could easily steal carries on any down.
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,donnylong,4,Mon Jul 20 01:05:11 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, Yeldon's tape is very underwhelming. If this is true than we are putting our faith in the Jags ability to asses RB talent, and we will be assuming that they saw something most people didn't. They are going to be behind early and often so even as a work horse, his load wont be that big. At his current ADP there are other guys I like more."
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,jimtow28,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:07 2015 UTC,"His tape is good and bad, the dude can flat out fly for his size and he's a bruiser as well, but he didn't use his weight very well and didn't have good vision. Its very correctable and he was a first round prospect, so I don't think it's right to knock the jags scouting. He's one of the few backs in the league that project for 250+ touches currently and that in itself is invaluable. I'd take him in the 6th with confidence, but I prefer established veterans as personal preference"
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,LoudSweaters,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:33 2015 UTC,xm fantasy radio said he's supposed to ball out this year.

He's got great potential and strong opportunity, but it remains to be seen what his role will be. Blocking ability, grasp of the offense, and workload that he can handle are all factors that are very difficult to quantify until we've seen him in a few (real, not preseason) games. Until we have those answers, drafting him, or any other rookie for that matter, is a very risky proposition."

fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,scrotal_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:20:32 2015 UTC,Looks like he's gonna be a 3 down back. Could get some good garbage time stats when the jags are getting blown out
fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,Mclovin_21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"I've been grabbing him once I've filled my roster with reliable guys.  I really don't care if he pans out or not. I have no expectation of anything. He's got some challenges like learning pass pro, a bad O-line and a team who will likely need to throw the football to stay in games while abandoning the run.  Still, of all the rookie RBs who have a legitimate shot to play, he is (IMO) the most talented. I think he's better than Gordon, at least from the tape I've watched. But Gordon's situation is so much better.   I think Gurley is on a completely different tier than those two, though. But will he play and/or be healthy? That's the question.  Let's say Yeldon in the B-/C+ tier of RBs, but will get lots of plays. That's not bad for a 6th-round or later pick. I'm not saying he's gonna start, just that he should get decent usage and really, that's all you can ask for. If he's starting for you, I sure hope you have some insane WRs."

I have argued hard for him all over the place on here, so I wont do it again, but I think most commenters make their judgement based on what they heard and not what they watched. Yeldon has the skillset to be  a top notch back."

Yeldon has the skillset to be a top notch back.   I'll gladly grab your back on this one.  Yeldon was a steal in the jags real draft.  He can be a 3 down back and can catch passes.  GTFO with this Toby Gerhart stealing carries nonsense. They drafted a back to take over the starting role because they knew they didn't have a guy.  He is in a unique situation to take the starting role with no one of consequence threatening him for the gig.  To get a 5th round RB that probably won't need to share carries is worth the risk IMO.

fantasyfootball,3dv7rw,BelaKunn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"I like him, but there are a lot of reasons I shouldn't.  As a physical prospect he is just ok, the Jags offense is unsettled, the OL unproven, and despite what the jaguars say, it's going to be hard for him to hold off Denard Robinson, between the 20's and Gerhart in the red-zone.  The reason I like him is purely speculative.  I think Bortles and this young but talented receiving corp (including Julius) will take a major step forward this year.  That means Yeldon, offering better pass-blocking ability than Robinson and better play in space than Gerhart, should be on the field plenty.  Robinson will get out there, but it seems pretty clear they'd like to limit his snaps and use him as a specialist.  Yeldon should see lots of work, and I think he is just good enough to keep the job."

You play on espn, so people are probably using their rankings. So by pick 10 Brown, Gronk, and at least 7 Rb's will be gone. The people behind you will each take 1 RB, and possibly a 2nd for one of them. 3 more gone. So if you don't mind the 11th RB in the 2nd round your plan will work great. Otherwise you'll just  have to hope that more people don't take RBs and hope yours falls to you."

You'll have an early second round pick and you may not get your favorite WR, but you'll be able to choose from Jones, Megatron, Green, Nelson, Beckham, and you may still be able to get Thomas or Bryant.  Most, if not all, of those receivers are pretty interchangeable amongst each other value wise.

Not a ""who do I draft"" question but i'm playing a .5ppr league which awards points for punt/kick return yards/tds as well as bonuses for reaching milestones.   Full scoring here: http://i.imgur.com/kyHeJfe.png  Does anyone have any experience in a similar league and can recommend a strategy? Can I find Kick-off/Punt return depth charts anywhere?  Cheers in advance."
fantasyfootball,3du351,CamIsSuperman,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"Hey there.  I'm in a league like this. If you play your cards right, this stat can pay off for you. In my league, many of my league mates are unaware that we use PR/KR yards, so use this knowledge to your advantage. Basically it increases the value of any starters who also field returns (Antonio Brown is huge value, also increases Percy Harvin's value too). During the draft, you may also be able to sit out on the WR scramble and find mid-round value with returners. During BYE weeks, plugging in a returner at FLEX/WR can prove valuable, since each kick return is basically a guaranteed 20 yards, that means 2 points for you, which adds up over the course of a game.  As for depth charts, ourlads.com is solid. But keep in mind that if the team doesn't have an established returner already (like Antonio Brown) it's normally a training camp battle. So whoever the starter is can be iffy.   Hope I was able to help!"
fantasyfootball,3du351,Paula_Dean_Pelton,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:28:08 2015 UTC,Thanks man!  I actually raised up the point so I doubt many in the league will be unaware.  I assume kick returners are more profitable than punt returners given the guaranteed 20 yards? How far should I push these players up my rankings?

In short, those guys are in totally different situations, could both be awesome, it'd be defensible to pick either.  I will say, to ease your heart or whatever, as a rational Panthers fan I'm not convinced Julio has all that great a year even in a Kyle Shanahanaman offense without a consistent running game. I mean don't get me wrong, he's still a top 6 WR no doubt, just saying that I don't trust Atlanta's offense."

fantasyfootball,3du351,blblann,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:12:05 2015 UTC,That is a good point.  Lynch had 37 receptions last year while Forte had 102.
fantasyfootball,3dut24,stocktonisgoat,10,Sun Jul 19 18:08:02 2015 UTC,"Charles is seen by many as a number one pick, but he only had 68.9 rush ypg last season. He's a big threat in the pass game which raises his value, but to me that's too inconsistent to rely on from a number one pick.   It sounds like you haven't watched the Chiefs play. While some RB receptions might be inconsistent, his are not. That's the offense. It all funnels through one, very talented player."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,new-money,4,Mon Jul 20 00:55:24 2015 UTC,"100% agree on this. If you don't think passing yards for a running back are worth it on draft day, see this box score.  He had more fantasy points (41.5) than rushing yards (20); he absolutely murdered the Raiders without rushing almost at all."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,matthewjpb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:50:28 2015 UTC,One thing Fat Man knows how to do is get his RB's involved in the passing game. Even back in Philly he would look to pass all the time instead of handing Westbrook the rock. Screen plays are effectively his run game

I could probably bump Shady up a few spots on potential.   Also I am not touching Peterson, I think he is cooked and the burn from last year still hurts."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,Nightmanz,4,Mon Jul 20 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"Lacy - least risk Charles Lynch Bell - I occasionally see him fall to the 6-9 range.  That's where I'll take him. Forte Hill   Thankfully I like Forte, and he seems to be falling to the late first. I would consider taking Hill in the late first, but I'm more likely to go WR/WR if I can't get one of those 5 guys.  I doubt I'll get any of the other guys mentioned because I won't pay for them, but I'll continue ranking.  Lesean McCoy - would probably think about him in the mid-second, but I might not pull the trigger until the late second.  Foster - I never feel comfortable when I have him because of injuries.  He is a beast though.  Adrian Peterson - He could be unbelievable, but there is too much risk for him to be a first rounder.  Demarco Murray - could be a committee, lots of work last year, injury history.  C.J. Anderson - after the last two years in Denver I'm not touching this guy.  I might take Ball late because the starter in Denver is going to have lots of value.  I just don't feel confident that I know who that is, certainly not first round confident.   My snake draft is a 10-man, so that is how I think about rounds."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,Guido420,5,Sun Jul 19 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"Adrian Peterson - He could be unbelievable, but there is too much risk for him to be a first rounder.   Not really. He's a starter and Turner is going to stick to his guns unless AD just absolutely falls off. The chances of that happening are slim. He's often first off of the board, almost always top 3 and rightfully so."

I might take Ball late because the starter in Denver is going to have lots of value. I just don't feel confident that I know who that is, certainly not first round confident.    To be fair...Montee lost his job two years in a row because the guy behind him was better.  That's the only reason the Denver backfield HAS been shaky on draft day.  This isn't the same situation.  Things change.  Remember Shanihanigans?  Remember how nobody wanted a Redskin RB?  Then Morris cam along, Shanahan left, and that has changed.  I think comparing this years RB situation in Denver to the last 2 years is unfair.  CJ is the best RB on that team.  The cream rises to the top.  I don't agree CJ goes that early though.  I'd take every one of those guys, except probably McCoy or Murray, before Anderson."

fantasyfootball,3dut24,Z06,-8,Sun Jul 19 21:46:18 2015 UTC,"I doubt there are many people who are bigger fans of Jerrick McKinnon. In fact, at this stage in AP's career I don't think he's all that much better than McKinnon (take this as a compliment to McKinnon, but keep in mind AP's 30.) All that said, there's no chance McKinnon eats into Peterson's carries. They're paying Peterson way too much for that and the Vikings will want to get all they can out of AP this year.  Edit: I don't understand why this was taken to be me trashing AP. The main point was he'll have little competition. I do have some concerns of course, but really anyone should be concerned with any 30 year old RB. I don't think expecting 30 y/o AP to be worse than prime AP is stupid, especially when people's counter-arguments are anecdotal."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,eme_pirrade,5,Sun Jul 19 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"McKinnon has nice potential on the Vikings in the future, but to say that AP is not much better than him is plain wrong.   Each season he has played since 2007 he has eclipsed well over 1000 yards and has yet to put up a season with fewer than 10 TDs.. In the season where he tore his ACL he still put up 970/12, and then rushed for over 2000 yards and 12 TDs in his next season.   He is one of the most physically dominant players in the game today - if anyone is an outlier to the ""once you're 30 an RB loses steam"" notion, its Peterson. Of course he'll flare out eventually, but I doubt it's this year.   The only way you could come to the conclusion that McKinnon and AP are the same is if you were only paying attention to football last year."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,BenjaminStanklin,-5,Mon Jul 20 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"You literally linked his fucking stats page. I obviously know what AP's done, but contrary to your hypothesis I've watched enough football to know that even a sure HOFamer, and once in a generation talent like AP is susceptible to father time. The last generational RB was LaDainian Tomlinson, who was not at all the same into his 30s.   I guess I can see where my wording was misleading, but I do think AP is still better McKinnon, I just don't think the gap is as big as many think.   Like the other guy I replied to you took a hyperbolic, qualifying statement, and responded as if it was the only thing I said. When in fact my praise of McKinnon was only to say I'm not worried about AP's workload."

fantasyfootball,3dut24,BenjaminStanklin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:38:42 2015 UTC,"did you really just try and say AP isnt a whole lot better than mckinnon?   Asumming AD still has it (and I would imagine he does ) no current RB in the nfl is better than AD.  Sure hes 30, but he has had a lot of time off to rest that body. Dont insult AD. Also its AD, not AP."

I in no way insulted AP (which people also call him.) I believe McKinnon is legitimately a top 15 RB just based off talent, while you can't expect AP to keep going forever. I think it's fair to say he's ""only"" top 5 at this point. I also don't buy that a year off miraculously makes him 28 again.   Foremost, you're taking a hyperbolic, qualifying statement and acting like it's all I said. My main point was that even someone extremely optimistic about McKinnon didn't feel he'd cut into AP's carries at all."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,eme_pirrade,2,Mon Jul 20 01:27:38 2015 UTC,Yes even at the current point in his career it is ridiculous because you are assuming AD has fallen off!
fantasyfootball,3dut24,Wisefool157,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"I'm saying he could fall off because even RBs as good as he is have done it before. LT, the last generational RB, didn't play well in his 30s. I don't feel that simply being Adrian Peterson makes you immune to aging."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,eme_pirrade,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"AP may be old but don't forget he's well rested and angry. He's not just the featured back for the Vikings, he's the featured player. Dude is going to be huge this year."

I've been watching football since I was fucking four years old, and I'm in my 20s now. How much football have you fucking watched? Because I've watched enough to know that RBs often break down in their 30s, regardless of physical ability. Even RBs who don't break down are not as effective. RBs who are effective in their 30s were typically didn't rely on athleticism in the first place (Emmitt Smith, Frank Gore, Jerome Bettis, etc.) It's also very obvious to me that McKinnon is a special talent who will be one of the NFL's best in his own right. A 23 y/o McKinnon is not that much worse than a 30 y/o AP. People seem to think that a year off somehow turns the clock back 3 years, and he'll ""run angry"" for another 2000 yards, it's possible, but I don't think it will happen. I certainly don't think being skeptical makes me an idiot. But, whatever you can think what you will about AP, and you're not wrong for thinking it. However, for the ""donkey brains"" comment you can go fuck yourself. Though it is sort of fitting since I'm a Broncos fan, and rival fans call them the donkeys."

AP has played 1 more season and is 1 year older.  For me it makes no sense to draft a 30 year old AP as the #1 pick when I can get guys on better offenses in the prime of their careers (Bell, Lacy, Anderson, Murray)."
fantasyfootball,3dut24,v89_cs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"For me, Lacy, Bell, and Charles are clearly the top-tier.  Bell's suspension bothers me not one bit as long as you don't have a super-small playoff format (like top 4 teams out of 14 or something like that).  Pick a guy like Tre Mason late to cover for him, or just take Deangelo.  Lacy is super-safe, and the only danger with Charles is slightly elevated injury risk.  C.J. is close, but I wanna see a couple preseason games in Kubiak's offense before I put him up there.  Forte and Foster are next.  They're aging but shouldn't decline just yet, and they've just been so reliable.  Marshawn seems way overdue for an injury/decline just because of the tread on his tires and his violent style.  Plus they lost their C, which is never good.  McCoy, AP, Murray, and Hill comprise the next tier for me, and I dont love any of them.  Mccoy I think overrates his own ability.  Murray is a huge injury risk after last year's 500 touches and won't see anywhere near the same work or efficiency even if he stays healthy.  Still, everyone says he's a perfect fit for Chip's offense, so I like him the best of this group if you can handcuff him.  Hill is very good, but with Bernard lurking, its just so easy to see this turning into a RBBC.  AP is last to me.  He's 30, and honestly didn't look as explosive the year before last."

fantasyfootball,3dvpjz,BrostinChurchill,10,Sun Jul 19 22:42:28 2015 UTC,CBS Fantasy Football Today is my favorite.
fantasyfootball,3dvpjz,lil_shepherd_boy,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:35 2015 UTC,I really do find it to be a great blend of entertainment and information. It's my personal go to for fantasy football news.

fantasyfootball,3dvpjz,TC84,8,Tue Jul 21 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"ESPN Fantasy Focus was pretty good.  The former host just left though and I'm not excited for a replacement that won't keep Matthew's schtick under control and won't call him out on his shit from time to time.  This is always more for just keeping up to date with news, than actually trusting Matthew's ""analysis"" though.  He's not a bozo or anything but if you're a die hard football fan you'll start to notice when Matthew is clearly reaching and doesn't know or have the research to back up whatever he is claiming.  This was my favorite for the past few years though.    4for4's Most Accurate podcast is no nonsense.  Pure fantasy info from John Paulson who is one of the absolute best accuracy wise, but not much of a salesman/entertainer.  25-30 mins is a good length too , otherwise it can get mighty dry.    ESPN's Fantasy Underground is fun and alright.  Christopher Harris has enough of a personality that it's not crazy boring, he watches tons of film and knows his shit.  And the co-host was a former Patriots scout (I believe).  Only thing with Harris is he's CRAZY SLOW to adjust his opinion on anything, mostly due to doing so much work in the offseason and already having opinions formed on things.  So watch out for that.    Grantland NFL podcast is mighty entertaining but more of an over arching NFL podcast, not directly aimed at fantasy.  Fun and knowledgable discussion most of the time though.    The 2 Muggs, The Audible (FootballGuys), Rotoviz, and Fantasy Index pods I've listened to on occasion but for some reason never stuck with them, so I don't really have a strong opinion on them."

They go more in depth than you should ever need, so it's great food for the FF mind.  I also like ESPN Fantasy Focus. I know some don't like that one host (Nate) just left; but really Matthew Berry is, and has always been, the heart and soul of the podcast. So far I like it just as much as before. The best thing about Fantasy Focus is that it's a daily podcast during the season, so there's always an episode to listen to. It has a lot more nonsense, and if you are anything more than a casual player you definitely want to supplement your FF knowledge elsewhere. Still worth an hour of your day."

Funchess because of Benjamin's hamstring/s and he has a solid qb, and not targeting DGB at all. Abdullah and Coleman, just throwing them in there, like ""If they are around by then I might take a chance on em.""

It's not an exact science, and there will be draft anomalies from year to year (especially in the earlier rounds), but I feel like it gives me a good overview for spotting value players before my league drafts."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,swishnmiss41,14,Sun Jul 19 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"Niner fan here. The reason Kaep looked like garbage last year is because Roman and Harbaugh thought they actually had Peyton Manning instead of Kaepernick and threw him into a spread offense - which very obviously he can't run successfully. He just isnt that type of qb. Also throw in the organizational turmoil, rumors of high profile coach leaving, etc.  This season i think he will be a lot better but still wouldn't start him unless i wait on QB until rounds 9-10 and it doesn't pan out (maybe Tannehill isn't as good as people thought this year and i snag Kaep off waivers.)  The Niners are going to try to run it a lot more with Hyde and Bush/Hunter, especially in the redzone where Kaep is NOT a good passer. However, if you have a late round pick with no one who looks better i wouldnt hate the idea of drafting him. We still do have Anquan Boldin, Torrey Smith and Vernon Davis who are all proven veterans."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,dub_nation11,9,Sun Jul 19 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, they didn't let Kaep be Kaep. Hes dangerous because of his legs.   With that said, I still don't think he's a top 12 QB. I mean there are some solid (and consistent) options ahead of him."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,zodiacs,3,Sun Jul 19 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"I have him at 14th, so not particularly. I think he'll improve over what he did last year, though."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,CharlieFlags,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"14th sounds like a much better rank than most people. I'm in a 16-team league where the scoring favors rushing yards, and he is definitely on my radar. But in standard scoring 10-12 team leagues, I don't see myself drafting him before seeing what their offense is like."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,earmouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:23:31 2015 UTC,"No, I'm in a ten-team league and I don't see myself drafting him, but I just think that he'll get a bit better this year, especially with the coaching changes. It's just a hunch, to be honest, but I don't see him much further down than 16th/17th."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,CharlieFlags,2,Sun Jul 19 18:31:51 2015 UTC,He should not be drafted in 1qb leagues of 12 teams or less.  If he puts up a couple good weeks then he could be relevant but right now I can't see any reason to talk about him.
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,new-money,2,Sun Jul 19 17:00:05 2015 UTC,"Even if his lackluster seasons are due to the offensive scheme, he still doesn't haven't quality talent around himself to be ahead of other QB1s."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,kingajeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:50 2015 UTC,I'm curious whether people would rather have Kaep or Palmer?
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,xSincosx,10,Sun Jul 19 18:43:17 2015 UTC,I'd personally take Palmer
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,Jeremy_jay7,4,Sun Jul 19 20:38:10 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought about it, but I think I take Kaep for the upside. I would be ready to move on quickly after a couple weeks if the Niners don't let him run enough. QB should be deep enough that you can find another QB in case Kaep is a bust - most likely Kaep would be your QB2."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,earmouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't know that he should be drafted unless your league is 14+ teams depending on how many teams roster 2 QBs, but he definitely bears watching. He has possibly the biggest upside outside of the top 10. You can also get him extremely late as it's very possible he goes undrafted in leagues 12 or fewer and I'm not that uncomfortable with him as my starter. He had a down year last year, but is being drafted like he'll get worse. 25 passing TDs with 5 rushing TDs is fairly possible, add in about 4000 total yards and he could easily finish top 10 if not higher. Honestly he's just another feather in the ""wait on QB"" cap."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,eme_pirrade,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:40:21 2015 UTC,"He's probably worth drafting, depending on your league makeup.  8 teams, probably not.  10 or 12, probably if you like him.  14+, definitely.  In leagues that offer 4 points per pass TD, I'm more likely to draft him.  I wouldn't expect a ton from him.  If I'm getting a top 4 or 5 QB, I'm probably not drafting a backup (apart from keeper leagues where I'll take a guy with upside).  His athleticism makes him dangerous, as a lot of running could offer extra points via rush yardage/TDs.  That said, I don't really like the 49ers dynamic this year.  If he blows up, awesome.  If he's a dud again, I'm dropping him for someone else.  He's not someone I'm targeting, but if I waited for QB and took Ryan or Romo as my QB1, I might add him in a late round, depending on who else is on the board."
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,uncchris2001,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:44 2015 UTC,"The issue with Kaep is that you can't count on him. One week he'll blow it up and be a top 3 Fantasy QB, the next week he'll only throw for 100 yds and get picked off twice. He's too inconsistent and I personally wouldn't take the gamble fantasy-wise"
fantasyfootball,3dujm1,guitarscreams95,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:11:37 2015 UTC,"What I wonder is whether defenses have just figured out how to stop running QB's.  Aside from Wilson, who is very judicious and has a BEASTLY running game to play off of, none of them have had a ton of success recently.  From Kaep to Cam to RG3."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,FFBot,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:57 2015 UTC,"Going from 8 to 10 man league, 1 PPR, can only keep one: Dez Bryant, OBJ, CJ Anderson, Eddie Lacy. I'm leaning towards either Dez or OBJ. OBJ is getting Victor Cruz back to take some pressure off and I believe Eli will be more comfortable this year in the offense. Dez got paid so I'm worried he might lay back because of his personality."

That guy is Lacy. None of the others are going in the first round. He's the clear cut #1 back on a team that scores often. Dez is tempting, but WRs are much easier to come by than bell cow backs like Lacy. Don't get cute w/ OBJ. He's going to be a beast, yes. But the likelihood of Dez or Lacy being a bust this year is MUCH less than OBJ being a bust."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,Kobe_Didnt_Do_It,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:08 2015 UTC,What picks do you have to give up? First rounder for all of them?  I'd consider Eddie Lacy. I think he has the best situation.

In a league where only 12 QBs start, he is not that valuable.    So I think your decision is good."

fantasyfootball,3du33m,Kobe_Didnt_Do_It,12,Sun Jul 19 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"Youve gotta go with OBJ in the 16th round.  What I like to think about when picking keepers is what round the player would usually be drafted in verses what round I'm keeping them in.  Then I think about how many rounds I'm saving.    For example, if Gronk would normally be drafted in rounds 1-3 and you keep him in the 6th round, you're saving 3-5 rounds.  If OBJ would normally be drafted in rounds 2-4 and you keep him in the 16th round, you're saving 12-14 rounds.  You should keep OBJ."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,gocgo,4,Sun Jul 19 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yea I usually live by that rule as well. Problem is the TE position. Gronk is so far and above the #1 TE it's not even close. No chance he's there in the 3rd round. He'll probably go early 2nd if not the first round. Then you have the scenario of not keeping him and instead riding the TE carousel which, judging by last season, is not a fun ride.   Another side of me is saying keep OBJ in the 16th and then just draft Gronk in the 1st (if I'm picking 8-10) or try my chances at grabbing him in the early 2nd round."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,Kobe_Didnt_Do_It,2,Sun Jul 19 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Keep ODB and draft Gronk if you really want him.  In that situation you have the same two guys and a 6th round pick.  If you keep Gronk and draft ODB you have both guys and a 16th round pick.  If you're committed to both you can get them so pick the option that leaves you with a better draft pick

We can keep 3 players to up to 3 years if we want. keepers values go up by $5, $10, $10 depending on length you keep them *you can also franchise tag one player for the average value of the top 5 players at that position.   Current keeper thoughts:   Alshon (already have on 2 year deal): $18, $28 ODBJ: $6, $16, $26 *Lamar Miller: $3 (can option anyone under $10 if that was their drafted value last year) AP (franchise): $65   Guy in my league was discussing trading me Antonio Brown. AB is priced at $31 and is in the last year on his contract. Has to go back to the draft next year.  In turn he would receive ODBJ who could be kept for the next 3 seasons AND Latavius Murray who I have for $1.  Keepers after this trade would be:  Alshon, Antonio Brown, AP, Lamar Miller.  Thoughts? Should I give up the future for this season?"

You have to start 3WR and you can start 4 with the flex.  Along with the PPR that makes having multiple top WRs a very desirable strategy.  Obviously a top QB is great too, but my thinking is if you keep Jordy and Lacy you have flexibility.  You can still land Luck if you end up in the right spot, or you can take a top WR or a top RB or Gronk.  Whereas if you keep Luck you are basically going to be forced out of drafting Gronk (I feel your WRs and RBs would suffer a lot even with Lacy) and you're going to feel obligated to draft a WR or RB in the first."

Planning on taking Watt with the 4.1, our scoring makes him very valuable. So it's just down to Jordy or Luck. You got me leaning Jordy."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,StonerJack925,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:12 2015 UTC,Jordy 12 Team 3WR puts a lot of value on the top 30 or so receivers.  6PPTD elevates the top 2 QBs with narrowing value as you descend to the 14th QB overall.  Luck might have another great year but the Value Jordy gives you in a field where the top 36 will be played every week is hard to pass up.

Landry had a great year last year and has the talent and opportunity to FLEX or WR2 in PPR formats.  Bell is on a better offense and it's easier to lock in on the Lions RBs than it is to overpay for Hyde (assuming he isn't kept already)  100 players kept is going to drain the talent pool very quickly and stability through WR2/RB2/FLEX is where I'd focus.

fantasyfootball,3du33m,ryebeer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I don't like McCoy this year. He didn't look great last year and after being shipped to Buffalo he has experienced a big drop in oline skill. Because of that, I'd say Jeremy Hill (going into camp as the #1) and (even though it's sort of a toss up) Alston Jeffery only because he's also the #1 there, as opposed to Cobb's #2 status."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,Truman___Burbank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"Would your first keeper constitute as your first round pick if you kept him? Otherwise, I wouldn't keep any of these guys because you can get much better players, most likely, by selecting from the available player pool.  Worst case scenario, you end up redrafting them from the available player pool because they will still be there if you draft number 7 overall."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,DomiNate_Track,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:49 2015 UTC,At 0.5 PPR I'd keep Jeremy Hill and Alshon Jeffery.  Hill is impressive in PPR formats and is an easy handcuff.  Jeffery is in a good situation for receptions to bolster his numbers.  McCoy makes it through the first round in nearly all of my mock drafts.  If you value him as an RB1 he should be available at your 7th overall pick.  Cobb is a strong option as well but I'd rather keep a WR1 over a Slot or WR2 like Cobb.

ODB for a 16th Luck for a 4th (QBs go early b/c of 2qb starters) AB for a 3rd   ODB is pretty much a guarantee for me to keep with that incredible value, but I'm a little split between Luck and AB. Both are almost certain to go in the first round if I don't keep them so the value is there for both. Im leaning towards luck so I can be sure I get an elite QB at a good price and then I can wait until late for my 2nd QB. But the idea of having both AB and ODB at well below their market price is so tantalizing. I don't see any reason why AB won't be the most consistent skill position player in football again this year and I loved having his consistent production last year. Being able to have the WR position locked down before the draft even starts would be pretty awesome. What do you guys think?"

AB is a great, consistent pick, but he has a little less value in non-PPR leagues, and at pick 22-32 you're only getting about half a round of value in keeping him.  Not to mention, we still haven't seen Luck at his best yet and his WRs are wayyyyyyyy better than last season (Injured and ineffective Wayne/Nicks were two of his primary options last season.)  He still threw for 4,700 yards 40 TDs, and rushed for another 300/3TDs."

fantasyfootball,3du33m,habs33,2,Sun Jul 19 19:51:55 2015 UTC,"Miller is definitely the best player on the list (and somehow still underrated.)  Keep him, and you have the best RB2 in the league before the draft even starts.  The other vet spot for me is a tossup between Andre Johnson and Jordan Matthews, especially because it's a PPR league.  AJ is the safer option--he's a stud, and Luck will get him the ball consistently every game.  Matthews could easily average something insane like 8-10 receptions a game as the WR1 in Chip Kelly's offense, but if Bradford goes down (he will) Matthews value could be all over the map.  Taking Gates would be a huge mistake--Sure he had a great season last year, but the past couple seasons before that he was a middling TE at best, at his age I'd expect him to regress to that level.  You can get that production 5+ rounds after AJ and Matthews get drafted.  As for your rookie, I think Sims is a relatively low upside option in an RBBC pass first and often offense.  Either him or Charles Johnson will likely be a bench stash with the hope they break out, and I think CJ is a much better candidate to have a huge year.  There are plenty of articles pegging him as a huge sleeper with Teddy Ballgame this season if you google and read up on it."

fantasyfootball,3du33m,darkeagle91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"I still think OBJ gives you the best overall value for keeping him and so he should be your decision. I can understand what you're thinking with RB1 being a priority, but I think you can't overlook the fact that you can essentially get OBJ in the 8th round (if I'm understanding your league correctly). Besides, running backs always shift around during the season. And there will always be 2-3 key guys who go undrafted to start the year."

At the very least Dunbar will steal third downs from him probably. The upside of him is tantalizing though. I'm worried about Maclin too though because he really didn't look good when Sanchez started playing for the second half of the year. And while Smith is better than Sanchez, I think Smith is more like Sanchez than he is like Foles, so the worse production with a QB like Sanchez is worrying."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,Truman___Burbank,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"This is really the choice I'm struggling with most. Randle has a lot of upside as he may very well end up leading a RBBC behind a monster oline, but I've also seen Maclin take short passes to the house, so I'm wondering how much of a downgrade KC will truly be for him (certainly and admittedly it will be a downgrade). Something to consider as well is the fact that Maclin honestly didn't look all that great when Sanchez started playing. Not sure if it was just a question of rapport or if it's indicative of Maclin not doing well with a QB who doesn't sling the ball deep as much. Gah I can't decide. Help me /r/fantasyfootball, you're my only hope."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,Truman___Burbank,2,Sun Jul 19 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want to rely on Maclin breaking 5 yard passes into 50 yarders, though, even though he is a damn solid receiver. That's kinda like picking up Antone Smith last year and trying to ride him to the championship. If it was PPR I'd possibly edge a bit more towards Maclin, but even though you've already got 2 RBs I just don't see Maclin as worth it here. At the very least you can take a flyer on him in the draft for cheap, whereas Randle will cost a bit more. I'd go with Joseph and the higher upside (and monster OL)."

I'm leaning towards keeping Julio (I'm assuming that my second place finish will mean i'm drafting 11th) but I'm not sure if I should take Kelvin or Jordy for value.

Graham's price would regularly be $44 this season, but I can also 'franchise tag' him for $30, but he'll automatically go back in the draft pool next season.   I was already planning on going cheap at QB unless I want to overpay for Brees, so I'm a bit iffy on doing the same with TE a little bit, but I'm not sure if I want to tie up $30 or so on Graham in Seattle when I want to spend a lot on solid RBs/WRs."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,HaphazardHawlucha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:46 2015 UTC,No to the rams D.  No to Jimmy Graham.  Evans for $4 yes.  You want to spend on RB/WR's here.  You'd be wasting $ on Graham even at $30.

I like the value for everyone, but I'm nervous with Mac going to KC, with Cooks being the main target, and Ingram losing touches to Spiller.

It's really not hard to find servicable or good RB2s later, especially in PPR and Gore carries a fair amount of risk to go with his considerable upside.  I'm also just personally a believer in Megatron this year.  I've had good experiences taking players who people fear only because of injuries.  You can get great value that way: for example the possible #1 WR in the 3rd round."
fantasyfootball,3du33m,TheMallNinja,3,Sun Jul 19 17:07:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it is even close. Would definitely go with Megatron. Gore is entering his 11th season as a RB and starting out with a new team. Both are huge risk factors to consider.

Or will CJ Spiller take carries/snaps away? Morris is usually there around that time. He is a great runner..doesnt get many/if any passes but he should be a decent close to 1000 yard rusher. Solid value at round 3/4..no?  Also..I like the Julian Edelman (Pats fan bias though) and Desean combo. JE11 has a HIGH floor and DJax has a great big play potential. thought they might work well together as flex.  .  Thanks for the help!  .  Edit: added Fantasy pros ADP (average draft position)

Julio will be insane this year, I love the Lacy, Alfred Morris picks, but I would have picked a different player than Miller. That coaching staff clearly can't see a good thing when they have it, and Ajayi will hurt his carry numbers. I like the upsides of your bench players though"

If you went first and got Lacy..then had to wait 14 picks and DT was still there? thats some great luck mixed witht he foresight to see how much value that is. Then I assume you got Julio next.

Plus with Randle as a swap-in option, you shouldn't have any issues. However, I think doubling up at QB in 7 and 9 is unnecessary, given that this is a 10-team. If your QB gets injured, picking up a replacement from the wire is not an issue.  Doubling up on TE is definitely unnecessary - leave Gates on the wire for now!  Love Devante Adams late.  Don't really like Montee Ball, I'd leave him on the wire too.  First eight picks are good, but I'd reconsider your bench strategy overall. Colston has never really come through, and it might be worth grabbing a ""flashy"" rookie WR or RB as a lottery ticket."

Matthew Berry did a pretty good job illustrating how this works in his 100 facts article for this year.   Consider the case of ""Player A.""  A young quarterback, you have to be concerned with how he finished the 2014 season. Averaging just nine fantasy points per game in his final three games last year, ""Player A"" used to have his rushing as a big part of his fantasy appeal. But his rushing touchdowns have decreased every season he's played, including last year, when he had the lowest total of his career along with the second-lowest rushing yardage total of his career. He's getting more careless -- his 24 turnovers last year were 10 more than he had the previous year and, in fact, only five QBs in the NFL had more interceptions than he did last year. It's probably why his team brought in a big name running back this offseason amid talk they want to run more. The offseason in general has been tough on Player A, as the pass catcher he has targeted 369 times the past three years -- the most he's targeted any player, and the guy many call his ""security blanket"" -- has left the team. That security blanket's replacement? An aging player that is coming off the worst statistical 15-game stretch of his career.  Finally, per Pro Football Focus, 62 percent -- 62 percent! -- of Player A's passes were thrown within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage last year, so whatever you do this year, make sure you avoid ...  ...

fantasyfootball,3drq0o,Precookedcoin,21,Sun Jul 19 14:53:02 2015 UTC,"Just running down the list of top ranked players... keeping in mind you can literally just make shit up sometimes if it sounds plausible:  Adrian Peterson: Heard that they are looking to feature him on first and second downs. Role as a three down back is diminishing because of their fear he gets injured and decreases his trade value next year. Also they like what McKinnon showed last year and want to see if he can be the future.  Jamaal Charles: Did you know that Charles only accounted for 54% of the Chiefs rushing yards last year? Demarco and Leveon were over 75%  Lesean McCoy: The only 1,000 yard rusher last year to get over 300 carries besides McCoy was Demarco Murray. And Murray outrushed McCoy by over 500 yards. Buffalo's O-line is ranked at least 8 spots lower than Philly's was last year. Buffalo also has no quarterback, he will see so many people in the box.  Marshawn Lynch: Lynch finally got a contract extension and has already talked about the fact that he considered retiring. He plays when he feels like it. They lost their best O-lineman in Max Unger who was a huge difference maker.  Leveon Bell: Knee injuries like his are actually prone to a 50% likelihood of re-injury. He's also missing almost 25% of the entire regular season. If he comes back and isn't the same and you started in a hole you can't make playoffs.  Antonio Brown: Now that he is finally getting super star attention he costs too much to draft. No one has ever repeated the number of catches that he has. Martavias Bryant has been really impressing in camp. With no Leveon, Brown will get more coverage focus.   Gronk: I don't trust Gronk because he doesn't have Brady for 4 games and you have to spend a first round pick on him.  Dez: He finally got a new big contract and had been prone to poor decisions early in his career. Now that Demarco is gone, it won't be as easy for the Cowboys to pass.  DT-88: He lost 10 pounds this offseason. May not be able to be as physically dominant moving people around playing at a lighter weight. Running the ball more. Peyton has been less effective.  ..... meh that's enough. You get the point. Some are easy to persuade than others, but still, not hard to do.  Justin Forsett: He peaked last year, he has never had a statistical year like that ever"

Blount: Actually agree, but in years past that backfield had a lot more talent than this year  Hopkins: both those things can be said for a lot of solid receivers. It can be said about Alshon 2 years ago. how did that work out? Regardless, Andre leaving and more stability at QB can only be good.  Nelson: He's only 30, he had a meh 40 time so aging won't affect him as much as others, and is still the most reliable target in Aaron Rodger's system  Peterson: Which is good because he's got a year's rest, has a major chip on his shoulder, and it's not like ADRIAN FUCKING PETERSON is going to forget basic fundamentals in a year.  Peyton: he played through a torn quad and still averaged like 270 YPG in the process. Look for him to pick apart defenses with more men in the box now, since the run heavy thing might actually be to his advantage.  Gronk: Agreed about the injuries. A year ago, half this sub wouldn't touch him because he was ""made of glass."" He did insanely well for one year, and suddenly that isn't just history, it's ancient history. Be careful, guys!  Graham: You don't trade your best offensive lineman and a first round pick for someone you don't play, and God knows they didn't trade for his blocking ability. They're going to make Russell Wilson prove he deserves that $25,000,000/year he's threatening to walk if he doesn't get, and Graham is going to be the piece he needs, being the only true red zone thread on that team.  Murray: use and injury is a concern, but the Eagles had more yards before contact before their RBs than Dallas did, Bradford is elite at hitting his RBs on pass plays.  Bell: He's running and cutting. First 3 weeks are a crapshoot. How many 1-2 teams have you seen play the waiver wires well and win it all over the 3-0 team? This is a prime buy-low position.  Lynch: Agreed again, too many touches. Insane number of touches."

Along with coming back from injury and suspension.  But honestly Ive looked indepth to most top players and you can pick a questionmark for any of them, especally RBs.  Forte? Too old Jamaal Charles? Isn't used enough (had less than 15 carries a game for the final month or something like that last season, only more than 20 carries several times) Lynch? Lost O-lineman and has had too many carries to sustain based on historical trends Foster? Injury prone Peterson?

The True form of deception lies in the opposite tactic. Take the players in each round that you do not want, and choose opportune times to subtly speak positively about them. Speak as if you need them on your team. Speak as though you have already drafted them, as though they are a sure bet to be filling your roster in the upcoming season. Maybe even do a few mock drafts and leave a print out of your roster laying around.   Subliminal works as well. Want someone to take Foster, leaving Lynch available and on his way to your roster? Bring over a case of Foster's beer and leave it in your buddies fridge. Foster's is crap, he won't drink it, and he'll be staring at it every time he goes to the fridge.

If you want Lacy to drop to you at #3... that's tougher.  You have to talk about him as a low ceiling player.  That if Rodgers hadn't had that historic stretch of home games where the game was over at half-time, Lacy wouldn't have had nearly as much work.  I think its important to do something right before draft time for this very purpose.

fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,GATOR7862,27,Sun Jul 19 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"I took a quick look at this because it was something I was interested in like I mentioned.  I pulled stats from last year from here using yahoo standard scoring (4pts per TD) because that is where I play.  For 6pt TDs I used the exact same scoring settings only changing TDs from 4 to 6.     Here are the 1, 5, 10 qbs for 4 pts at the end of the year:    Num Name Total PPG    1 Andrew Luck 366.7 22.9   5 Drew Brees 319.9 20   10 Philip Rivers 283.8 17.7       And for 6 pts:    Num Name Total PPG    1 Andrew Luck 446.7 27.9   5 Ben Roethlisberger 373.8 23.4   10 Ryan Tannehill 345.5 21.6       So here are the differences:    Difference 4pts ppg % 6pts ppg %    Between 1 and 5  2.9 12.7  4.5 16.1   Between 1 and 10  5.2 22.7  6.3 22.6       All of this is assuming that you would've known who would end 1-10at draft time though, so just for fun I looked up 2014 QB ADP at Fantasy Football Calculator. If you compare the qbs by where they were actually drafted it makes it even more interesting.     4 points:    Num Name Total PPG    1 Peyton Manning 323.7 20.2   5 Andrew Luck 366.7 22.9   10 Tony Romo 275.3 18.4       6 points:    Num Name Total PPG    1 Peyton Manning 401.7 25.1   5 Andrew Luck 446.7 27.9   10 Tony Romo 343.3 22.9       And again, here are the differences based on ADP rather than where they actually ended up:    Difference 4pts ppg % 6pts ppg %    Between 1 and 5  -2.7 -13.4  -2.8 -11.2   Between 1 and 10  1.8 8.9  2.2 8.8       So while there does seem to be a bit of a bump in the difference between the number 1 qb and the number 5 qb (a 12.7% difference in 4pt TDs and a 16.1% differnce in 6pt TDs), the difference between taking the number 1 qb and taking the number 10qb is nearly identical in both scoring systems.  And this assumes that you know before hand who is going to finish 1-10.     In a more realistic situation, going by ADP, the number 1 qb last year ended up worse than the number 5 qb, and the difference between taking the 1st qb off the board and the taking the 10th qb off the board was identical.  The number 1 qb outscored the 10 by only about 2 points per game, or about 9% better.       If this is the case, why do people push taking top qbs earlier in 6pt passing leagues?  If the difference between the number 1 qb and the number 10 qb is nearly identical in both scoring systems why does it matter if they are taken earlier?  I'm not a data analyst by any means, so please point out any mistakes I made or incorrect assumptions I'm making.     If you want to take a look at my spreadsheet it's here.  Sorry it's a mess, I wasn't originally planning on posting it, so labels and consistency are a bit off."
fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,Neil_deNye_Sagan,4,Sun Jul 19 06:38:29 2015 UTC,"I think this is helpful for people who have this in mind.  A few things to consider:   Luck finishing #1 despite being drafted #5 is a bit unusual for QBs.  He made the jump this year.  Note that the top 4 or 5 QBs using either scoring method included guys who were top 3 in QBs drafted in almost every league (Rodgers, Brees, Manning). In addition to risk of injury, as others have suggested, guys who get a greater percentage of their TDs from rushing vs. passing are disadvantaged in 6 TD leagues.  Note that Wilson was 3rd among QBs with 4 points per pass TD, vs. 6th with 6 points per pass TD.  If you re-sort based on PPG, you see that Cam Newton was 8th in 4/PTD but 15th in 6/PTD. The difference between the top QB and a replacement level option seems to be substantially similar regardless of whether scoring is 4 or 6 points per pass TD.  That said, if you've drafted those lesser QBs, how likely is it you'll get replacement level value?  How likely is it that you played Ryan Tannehill for a substantial portion of those games?  How likely is it you drafted Nick Foles or Tom Brady or Cam Newton early and were unhappy with your QB for some games? Some leagues vary the INTs with the TDs.  I think my leagues where pass TDs are 6 points will usually count INTs at -2, while my leagues where pass TDs are 4 points will count INTs as -1.     Ultimately, if you draft QBs well (Luck or Wilson or Roethlisberger in 2014), you can find value regardless of scoring method for pass TDs.  If I'm in a 6/PTD league, I'll give a slight bump to those top QBs, however.  It offers a little extra positional advantage over those owners who have QBs that get more rushing TDs, and it helps minimize risk of being positionally disadvantaged overall.    EDITED to clarify a couple of comments and to add #4."
fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,uncchris2001,4,Sun Jul 19 14:29:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with your general sentiment that the change in scoring shouldn't make a ton of difference.  It's the difference of a handful of spots, which even in the first few rounds will often be swamped over by personal preferences for players.  I'm not wild about your analysis of points scored vs. ADP.  You're using far too few data points to be useful.  You could have just as easily compared Rodgers at ADP pick 3 to Cutler at ADP pick 9 to illustrate the point in the other direction.  As to the later point about drafting QBs early vs other positions, it's a bit more complicated that you're considering.  In a drafting situation, you compare players at different positions that are available to what you might be able to find at those positions later and decide what the best use of your pick is.  So, for example, if I'm sitting at pick 20 and deciding between the QB2 and the RB12 like many preseason rankings suggest I will be, it doesn't matter that RBs tend have a greater disparity between top picks and middling picks than QBs because all of top RBs are already gone.  For this example, and according to the scoring chart you posted, the difference between the QB2 and QB12 (approximately replacement level in a 10 team league) last season was 81.8 pts with 4pts/TD and 89.8 pts with 6 pts/TD.  The difference between RB12 and RB30 (an even lower replacement level, since many people play with a FLEX) was 62.9 pts.  And this is even assuming that you're going to be able to pick a mid-range RB with the same accuracy as a top QB (which I sincerely doubt).  So why would I take the RB there?  If anything, the QB should be going at least half a round earlier.  The trap that many people who espouse RB-heavy strategies fall into is comparing players that a are similarly ranked within their positions to each other (e.g. RB1 and QB1).  That has marginal value for a drafting situation, since outside of the first couple picks of the first round that scenario is never going to show up."

Ultimately I really wasn't trying to cherry pick here, which is why I ended up putting a link to the spreadsheet.  I'm definitely not in my wheelhouse trying to compare this stuff and was hoping people would show me where I made mistakes.  Figured me putting up these numbers would allow some of the smarter people in the sub come discuss it.  The RB points over replacement is interesting as well."

fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,SayNoob,2,Sun Jul 19 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"Nice work dude. So here's how I read it:  Yes, there is a big enough gap to quantify taking a qb early.   HOWEVER, that is only if you KNOW who will be the top qb.   While its safe to assume it would be Rodgers or luck, what's not to say that Brady doesn't go ""FU"" mode and throw for 53 TDs, or roethlisberger doesn't just air it out for 5500 yards.   So it is very possible to get a stud qb early, but JUST as likely to get something suitable later on, too."

In a 2 QB league... sheeeeit, they become the #1 position, or at least AS valuable as RBs and WRs. 6 pt TDs? Eh... not changing all that much for me.

fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,mrsammercer,10,Sun Jul 19 04:06:15 2015 UTC,"It lowers the value of quarterbacks who run a lot, like Russell Wilson, but it doesn't increase the value of the quarterback position all that much. If a top quarterback throws for 40 TD's, they'll have 80 more points in a 6pt than in a 4pt league for the whole season, 5 a game. But a quarterback who only throws 25 TD's will still have 50 more points for the whole season, about 3 a game. All of the top 14 QB's last season threw for at least 27 TD's except for Wilson.  So, the difference between the elite quarterbacks and the middling quarterbacks is increased when going from 4pt to 6pt, but there are still plenty of options for quarterbacks who will throw a lot of TD's"

Hope that helps"
fantasyfootball,3dsmk8,xxzDEADLYzxx,2,Sun Jul 19 02:00:42 2015 UTC,"About 1 round higher.  It's going to do two things.    The first is create more separation amongst to[ players at the position.  The difference between a 30 and a 40 TD season suddenly become 3.75 points per game instead of 2.5 points per game.    The second is raise the value of the position itself.  Getting that slightly better QB becomes that much more important.  So does the ability to grab that lightning in a bottle QB who is having an out of nowhere ridiculous year.    Some people are going to stick with the idea of QB streaming, but with 6 pt pass TD's more people will be rostering backups and therefore create a harsher waiver wire environment.   All in all, this is going to raise QB's ADP about 1 round higher than in 4 pt pass TD leagues.  Luck and Rodgers go from 2nd to 1st round guys and the rest cascades accordingly."

Top QBs hopefully get 40 TD's a season 40 * 4 pts= 160, divided by 16 games = 10 points per week from 4 pt TDs  40 * 6 pts= 240, divided by 16 games = 15 points per week from 6 point TDs  This does not take into account most fantasy seasons don't play through all 16 (17 weeks) regular season games.  Now lets compare that top 40 point QB who gets 5 points more per week compared to ""Average/bad QBs"" who should be projected around 20 TDs  20 tds * 4 points= 80, divided by 16 games = 5 points per week from TDs  20 tds * 6 points= 120, divided by 16 games= 7.5 points per week from TDs  What it comes down to is your Elite QB is getting 7.5 points per week more than a below average/meh QB, not including yardage differences.

fantasyfootball,3du7pu,agent_10,2,Sun Jul 19 18:50:26 2015 UTC,"I love this team. I always load up on RBs early. I've done 50+ mocks already (which I realize is kinda dumb before preseason) but each time I've nabbed Matt Ryan in the 6th or 7th. You may be able to wait on Ryan and grab a receiver earlier. Unless this is 6 pts per passing TD, in which case 5th round is about right.   EDIT: Also, why a TE in the 6th and 9th rounds?"
fantasyfootball,3du7pu,turd_fergusons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:42:14 2015 UTC,Great question about the TEs. I'm don't have a ninth round pick in my home league I traded it and have two tenth rounders instead so I just picked best available to keep things moving.  I grabbed Ryan on the turn so I could have technically snagged him in the sixth but I may wait in my real drafts for tannehill...they're my two guys this year
fantasyfootball,3du7pu,Dr_Lollygag,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:14 2015 UTC,Ah that makes sense. I'm high on Ryan and Tannehill too...but with Carson Palmer as the 20th QB in mocks at fantasy pros it's hard not to wait and go Tannehill in 9 / 10 and Palmer 13 / 14. But you can't go wrong with Matty Ice.
fantasyfootball,3du7pu,Assmybutt,2,Sun Jul 19 16:46:53 2015 UTC,I'll do it from the typical 12 man PPR league  1 - CJ Anderson  2 - Calvin Johnson  3 - Brandin Cooks  4 - TJ Yeldon  5 - Todd Gurley  6 - Amari Cooper  7 - Isaiah Crowell  8 - Kevin White  9 - David Johnson  10 - Ryan Tannehill  11 - DeVante Parker  12 - Austin Seferian-Jenkins  13 - Sam Bradford  14 - Matt Jones  Ready to take on the hate for loving rookies.

fantasyfootball,3du7pu,Dr_Lollygag,3,Sun Jul 19 15:05:55 2015 UTC,"More so than hating your rookie love (little stretch for Yeldon IMO but would love Cooper and Gurley at those picks), I hate that you didn't hedge your ASJ pick with another flyer TE like Ladarius Green or Eifert in place of Matt Jones. I also don't see Kevin White ever sniffing the starting line up on this squad so you could've taken a higher QB or TE there, or even (God forbid) taken a top tier defense"
fantasyfootball,3du7pu,Dr_Lollygag,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I am a big fan of Yeldon, and willing to reach. I completely agree that I would want to add on another high upside tight end."

fantasyfootball,3drzjz,SFEagle44,2,Sun Jul 19 00:49:42 2015 UTC,You mean as early as pick/position  six go wr wr?   Noticed that sometimes both Jennings and Crowell were on the short list but one was recommended first time then the other the next. Maybe due to a bye week conflict?
fantasyfootball,3drzjz,reinkarnated,2,Sun Jul 19 14:51:19 2015 UTC,"According to the limited sample size of their recommended pics, yes.  As soon as Lynch was off the board, they give a higher percentage to taking a WR over the next tier of RBs in the first round, even AFTER Brown was off the board (when they recommended taking Dez over Forte, Foster, or Anderson at pick 7.)  As far as their inconsistencies, I don't know. They have a degree of randomness to their picks, it could just be that they are so close in their rankings that it's arbitrary, or like you said, it could be a bye week thing."
fantasyfootball,3dt0rk,Dessy44,5,Sun Jul 19 04:17:49 2015 UTC,"A kind of down and dirty way to estimate prices is similar to the calculation for value-based drafting. Say there are 10 starting QBs in your league, take the projected fantasy points for each, and subtract the projected points for the lowest projected starter. So QB10 = 0 and then everyone else is basically their scoring above the worst starter. So lets say QB10 is Tannehill and you project him at 250 fantasy points, and QB1 is Rodgers and you project him at 350 points. So Tannehill is 0 and Rodgers is 100 (350-250).  Do that for each position, and add up the total scores for all the players. Divide the total money in the auction by that number to give yourself the dollar cost of a fantasy point above replacement value. And then you get an estimate for the price of each player. So lets just say that number comes out to $0.50 per fantasy point above replacement. Then $0.50 x 100 = $50 price for Rodgers and $0 for Tannehill."
fantasyfootball,3dt0rk,toochunky,2,Sun Jul 19 04:56:28 2015 UTC,"And of course you can tweak it to adjust for your roster size, etc. One way to do it is to do an estimate for a player pool that includes every player that will be drafted. Or you can say, people should spend 90% of their money on starters, and just do a pool of the starters and base the calculation on 90% of the total money. The prices for the end of roster guys is always going to be arbitrary based on how much money people have left over toward the end of the draft, so there's no real need to estimate it."
fantasyfootball,3dt0rk,toochunky,2,Sun Jul 19 05:06:11 2015 UTC,Simply put... You can't compare Rounds and Auction values... They just aren't the same thing.I would look into getting a couple auction vale sheets from trusted sources... But these should be used as GUIDELINES only. Values will vary wildly from league to league just based on how people like to build teams and spend money.  Some tips: Throw out a high profile (but wildly overvalued) player with your first couple nominations... This will help you clear out some money and give you some information on how the auction will go.   Be very aware of how much money every team has left. Without actually trying to... I've noticed that when I've had very successful auctions... I'm right in the middle third in remaining salary throughout the auction. Too much money spent early leaves you little control over guys grabbing insane values late... And if you save your money for too long... You end up picking a bunch of value guys up but leave money on the table.  Be the value police. I have a number for every player where I'm comfortable that they are a very good value... Whether I want them or not I will bid every player up to that number. Remember... Your goal isn't just to build a great team for a small salary... Its to prevent other owners from doing the same.  Go into the auction with a plan on what kind of team you want to build. Unlike a draft you have options... Want Rodgers and two stud RBs? You can probably do that.  Be ready to adapt and alter/abandon that plan as other opportunities present themselves.
fantasyfootball,3dt0rk,GOTaSMALL1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:31 2015 UTC,I like that idea of bidding them up to where I think they're valuable for everyone. Obviously there's gotta be some guys you're more interested in than others but yeah makes sense.

First of all, we don't even know if he'll avoid the PUP yet. His visit with Dr. Andrews either hasn't happened or hasn't been publicized yet. Maybe he'll be like RGIII and never be like his full self this season? We'll have to see in camp. What happens if Gurley has to miss multiple games and Mason just takes the job by storm? How can you then just take the job away completely and hand it to a recovering player with no NFL experience? If Mason does well, you'd have to think it would be a committee. Will Gurley be featured in the passing game? This has yet to be determined as training camp hasn't started yet. Right now the other RBs don't offer exceptional pass catching skills, so this is lower on my list of concerns than the rest.   Basically, until I can see him in camp I can't even properly rank him. Just so much volatility."

The Giants selected David Wilson with the 32nd pick, passing on players like Alshon Jeffery, Ty Hilton, Dwayne Allen, Bobby Wagner, and Alfred Morris   Second, I don't expect much from Gurley this year unless he absolutely shocks the world in camp and shows he's fully recovered, and even then he has to deal with Tre Mason entrenching himself at the starter position. I really think Tre is better than what people make him out to be, he's quick, desicisive, and elusive enough to avoid tackles and slip past defenders. On any other team looking for a workhorse (15-20 carries per game) back he would be it. Gurley is new to this system and while I think he is overall a better player than Mason, this year he will not be that guy and it will be more like a redshirt season for him"

fantasyfootball,3drudy,doktrj21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:02 2015 UTC,"CJ's line is looking awful this year, they've lost clady and the guy that was supposed to replace the right tackle has been moved to the left. There's going to be relief from a stacked box with Peyton there but it really depends on whether or not you think you need better than a C average line to correctly run a zone blocking scheme."
fantasyfootball,3drudy,hallaa1,3,Sun Jul 19 05:53:55 2015 UTC,"I guess, but here's what's in my mind. Rices last year in Baltimore, people blamed rice as well as his horrendous O-line for his dip in production. The next year, kubiak comes and with justin forsett, he killed it. The linemen however, didn't change, and forsetts success came purely on scheme. I think the same can be done in Denver, who has a better line than Baltimore did, even though it regressed. I just think the scheme kubiak runs benefits the rb immensely, and CJ has the talent to overcome a slightly less talented line.   Just my opinion though."
fantasyfootball,3drudy,doktrj21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:18:21 2015 UTC,I get third pick of my draft slot this year (10 team) and am seriously considering a late pick in the hopes of grabbing Julio/CJ in rounds one and two.

fantasyfootball,3drudy,Thehawkiscock,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:03:23 2015 UTC,"Everyone is bagging on the 49ers and the coaching staff, and while they didn't hire an offensive mastermind like Gase, I think Harbaugh not being there will greatly help out the offense. The OC is the same guy who coached up Andrew Luck and his son to be the top QB recruit in his class. I think a huge reason the 49ers were so bad on offense last year, and the years Harbaugh was here before that, is because Harbaugh insisted on being part of the playcalling. He would get the OC's call and either run with it, scrap it, or add his own audible to it, there was no consistency with playcalling at all. With a clearer system, and Kaepernick getting simple playcalls straight from the OC the offense should be a lot neater. That coupled with the talk of the offensive doing a lot more up-tempo stuff really makes me optimistic as a 49ers fan and as a drafter looking at 49ers players. Hyde is the clear #1 back, Kaepernick could have his best year yet statistically and play wise, and Anquan Boldin will be the de-facto tight end and outside WR. I rank all 3 of these guys highly and I think a lot of people will overlook them because of the overall turmoil of the 49er offseason. At least take a flyer on Boldin and Kaepernick, it won't hurt and it could pay huge dividends."

fantasyfootball,3drudy,reinkarnated,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:29:19 2015 UTC,"Hyde is a plodder, behind an offensive line that didn't get any better. On a team that is playing with a depleted defense of freshly retired players, meaning they will be playing from behind a lot more enabling a player like Reggie Bush to get more PT.  I don't disagree with you that Boldin is a good value. Maybe they let Kaep run more. But that's from a fantasy perspective. There's no way that as an actual team y'all are better off with Harbaugh gone and the losses that occurred."

I just joined a league with a 15 transaction limit so streaming isn't an ideal option and I'm wondering what the right play with defenses is.

fantasyfootball,3dsck9,sawybawy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:19:22 2015 UTC,You pick up defenses off the waiver wire a week or two in advance depending on who they play. This helps you use late round picks for more depth while staying above average on defensive points if you make the right choice weekly.
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,docollas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:21:44 2015 UTC,"I like the Denver Broncos as a value-pick D, with Wade Phillips. He uses a 3-4 scheme which normally gets you more sacks – and they have Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware. Their secondary is great, too, with Harris and Talib. They added great pieces in the draft, too. Expect a top-5 fantasy finish."
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,feetandballs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:45:00 2015 UTC,The best defense to draft is the one available in the second to last round that plays a terrible team week 1.
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,BigJibbah,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"The bottom line is that streaming D's works, and I'm sure there are statistics out there proving this. I started last year with the Bengals D, and when they flamed out I was able to use the Bills and Browns, among others. Basically, outside of about five teams, you won't get even relatively close to a sure thing on D, and if you do, the return on the higher pick you likely wasted isn't enough. I will say that no D's exist in a vaccum, and that some are better than others to stream, but if even the Redskins can curbstomp the Jags, the fact is that over-drafting a D by more than one round isn't worth it."
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,minddebaser,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:03:00 2015 UTC,Packers D/ST is a real sleeper pick this year. Should be a top-3 secondary with addition of rookies Randall and Rollins. Picks aplenty. Run D should be improved with return of Raji to NT and resigning Guion. Rookie Ty Montomery should be able to take a few kick returns to the house (and Micah Hyde)
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,Pauldcesar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:01 2015 UTC,"Most people will say stream. I'm personally looking for Miami or Houston later in the draft this year, but if we want to talk sleepers, here are some thoughts.   The Browns weren't terrible on D last year and are constantly overlooked because they're the Browns. Could be worth a look if they stay on pace.   Lovey Smith gets another year in Tampa. They were all around terrible last year, but Lovey has pretty consistently had a top 10 D in his tenure as HC and he picked up at least 3 solid FAs this year (all from last year's solid Dallas D). Perhaps this is the year he starts to turn things around?  The Titans have a history of having a decent D roster, but just not getting much out of them. Now that LeBeau is in charge out there one could argue that won't be the case anymore. They've still got a superstar DT in Casey and they made some splashes in FA pickups, including Brian Orakpo, that could lead to some solid output."
fantasyfootball,3dsck9,SuperFamousGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:30 2015 UTC,"Browns. They have a tougher schedule this year, but have ranked at the top or near the top in lots of pass defense lists. If a couple of the 75 run stoppers they added do well you're looking at a top 5 defense."

That being said, I don't really recommend doing this in a real auction draft because most likely no one will fall for it and you'll end up with a useless player on your bench. Granted you can drop them later, but unless your team is already stacked it's not worth it. You'll just look silly to your league mates."

fantasyfootball,3drxy9,Slurmeee,17,Sat Jul 18 21:46:48 2015 UTC,I think two teams your first season is manageable.  I wouldn't recommend going anymore than that though.

Anything more just seems like an overkill to me.
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,Imperial10,4,Sat Jul 18 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with two teams. It's manageable, but allows variety and if things don't work out you aren't stuck with one bad squad all year. Plus you can do a standard and a ppr, snake draft and an auction draft, etc. You'll be able to focus on both teams and leagues without being overwhelmed or making mistakes because you have so many lineups to watch.   Go with two teams, and then play FanDuel weekly if you want to. It's the perfect balance."

fantasyfootball,3drxy9,reinkarnated,2,Sun Jul 19 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"Given the fact that hockey requires a lot more day to day maintenance, you should be fine with two teams.  It doesn't take a whole lot more effort. You are typically looking at 1-2 days a week where you have to focus a little harder because you are having to make waiver wire claims for 2 teams instead of one.  Most basic piece of advice I can give you is to get fully accustomed to the scoring settings, and roster requirements (how many of each position are you required to start) before you draft. Try to do some research catered more towards the specific type of scoring you do, such as if it is point per reception or not. Whether or not quarterback touchdowns are worth 6pts or 4 pts.  Don't be a slave to the rankings of whatever site you are using. Use outside websites to get additional info since everyone will see the stories posted on the site you use anyway. Some basic popular ones, fftoolbox.com, fantasypros.com, rotoworld.   Lastly, in the draft, do NOT draft a kicker until the second to last round at the earliest. Since you're only doing 2 teams, it isn't a bad idea to try and diversify the players you pick in rounds 1-3. It's fine to have 1, even 2 of them be the same on both teams, but if they peform poorly, or get hurt, you are in big trouble. Save the common players for later rounds because the risk is lower if they aren't good, but the payoff is even greater if they are."
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,nuhertz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:34 2015 UTC,Never though about making sure I don't draft the same top players that seems like a very good idea.
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,Ryangonzo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:47 2015 UTC,As long as you're not avoiding great picks just to avoid having same player in both teams.  I often end up with the same player because I consider them a sleeper or a steal at their current adp.
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,MoneyForSale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:09:24 2015 UTC,Or I move on them on the waiver wire first.  My teams look more and more similar by season end.
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,Oyb_,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:00 2015 UTC,I run 3 teams. It's not to hard. If you are doing your research it should carry over to all your teams as far as drafting and free agency. The only thing that will be different is who to start. Just make sure you run them all through the same website. When you don't one of the teams tends to get forgot about.
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,gibbsftw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:13:00 2015 UTC,"I think you could probably handle 3-4. If you are in a money league you should be doing some research already, additional time spent on the extra leagues will just be trade offers and waiver wire work which is not a lot.    Being in multiple leagues also opens your eyes to other players. My first year playing I was only in 1 league and got too attached to my players to make good trades. When you are in multiple leagues you will be matched against players you may own in other leagues, it's weird that losing the attachment helped me in trades last year."
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,RIPSweetPrince,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"I only had 1 league my first year of playing but I think a couple leagues could benefit you more than overwhelm.  I definitely would not do more than 3 in your first year.  The multiple teams gives you the chance to take a couple different approaches during the year and experiment for the future.  I would suggest different team names between the leagues if both are using the same site, helps me keep them separate and avoid confusion."
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,docollas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:42:06 2015 UTC,Definitely 2.  Do a standard league and a PPR.  See what you like better.  1/2 PPR is the way to go though.  Good luck.

fantasyfootball,3drxy9,tittycloud,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:52:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of it depends on the league. If the league is small and/or benches are short, and the waiver wire is really stocked, you have to be much more active, because there will regularly be impact players that you need to try to get.  But if there are a lot of owners or deep rosters, you don't have to worry about every single injury. If Jamaal Charles sprains his ankle, you know that somebody already owns Knile Davis and don't have to sweat it. And for your extra league(s) you can also choose leagues that have free agent acquisition budget rules (FAAB) for the waiver wire, so you don't have to worry about racing to the waivers the second injury news is reported."

I like to root for the players I draft so that can be hard when the team I play against in one league has gronk while in my other league he's in my lineup. Cheers!
fantasyfootball,3drxy9,halfman-halfshark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:21 2015 UTC,"For your first season I'd say do one team. I know some people wont agree with me on this, but I think it makes the season a lot more fun when you just have one team, and one set of players to root for. I now do 3 leagues a season and its great to have different variety between them (PPR, League Size, etc) But I always liked just having the one team to root for, rather then having to hope for a player for my one league, but then also root against him because Im going against him in another. Just my two cents, you could 100% manage 2 teams though. Fantasy Hockey is a lot more work than Fantasy Football imo."
fantasyfootball,3drxk4,GameofFriendZones,3,Sat Jul 18 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think a week is good and that's what we do. It gives everyone enough time to adjust any draft strategies/sheets.

At the draft you reveal the 2 you will actually keep. I think it helps out a lot more in case of injuries or trades. But we will see how it goes.

fantasyfootball,3draod,LamanamanumiReborn,7,Sat Jul 18 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"What's really never going to happen is Mason rushing for 1000 and 10TDs in 6 games. Sure, he's exaggerating, but why does he feel like he needs to?  What's more likely is that Tre Mason will be a mediocre RB, and even if he rips off 100 yard game or two...he will see at minimum a 50/50 with Gurley.   Sometimes guys just have that it factor and Gurley is one of those guys. I don't really like talking about Gurley much b/c until we see how he is on that knee it's baseless speculation. But, when he is ready, he will be the starter."
fantasyfootball,3draod,mikeditka23,-1,Sun Jul 19 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"And the first time Gurley gets hit by an NFL DE, his career could be over. I don't disagree that Gurley us lined up to start, but its crazy to think that a good showing by Mason goes unnoticed. If anything, it gives Gurley more time to get healthy. Rushing a 1st rounder with a bad knee back to the field costs people their jobs"
fantasyfootball,3draod,LamanamanumiReborn,2,Sun Jul 19 12:57:40 2015 UTC,"Couple things here...are we talking in terms of fantasy value @ his ADP? If so, I think he's over-drafted. I likely won't have him on my teams. But, I don't think we are...I think we are talking about Mason being a potential value...I agree, he is.   But, then people have to take it a step further. Reality apparently isn't interesting enough. They have to say that Tre Mason may have 1000 yds and 10 TD's in 6 games and end up the starter all season.....THAT is the point where I have to step in and say lolwut?   As for the apocalyptic phantom defensive end (who likely is the same guy Gurley was playing in the SEC nearly every week...yes I'm saying that a ton of D-line are from sec and that's the best conference by far...)that's going to end Gurley's career...nope. Is it possible? Sure. But, this kid isn't the first running back with a major knee injury. Pretty much all the greats had one in college, the pros or both...take a second to really think about Frank Gore...he's had two major knee injuries and has been doin the damn thang for over a decade. (I personally think his bowling ball running style helps in that vs Gurley it won't as much...but I don't want to get bogged down.   Also, this is hardly a rush back. By week one it'll have been just under 10 months. He's likely to not see the field until week 4-6. They are very open about saying that he won't be on the field less than 100%.   If you can snag Mason late and are willing to sacrifice that pick for someone who is likely getting 10-15 carries a game after week 6, I still think it's viable given the proper round/value. But, Todd Gurley is the best RB in St. Louis. If I can get Gurley in the top 5th or later I'm doing it all day"
fantasyfootball,3draod,mikeditka23,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:00:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't misunderstand me, I absolutely agree that Gurley is meant to be top dog there, and unless his prognosis changes between now and training camp, I'm with you taking him in the 5th or later anywhere I can justify it. And 6th/7th is an overdraft for Mason. If I'd still drafting my starting lineup, no way am I going to grab a part timer. After the 10th is all about lottery tickets and random plug ins anyway, so if he's one of the lone (even temp) starters come 11+, I'll take a shot if I need to.  1000 yds and 10 tds in 6 games? no chance. 600 yards and 3 or 4 tds? completely possible, depending on schedule and if their passing game can keep defenses at bay even a little bit.  The value in Mason is, if he knows he's playing for his job(or even potential trade bait), he just may step his game up. As you said:   They are very open about saying that he won't be on the field less than 100%.   So if Mason is competent, why not leave him out there and ease Gurley in? that's a tough, punishing defensive division.   I don't think Mason can keep the starting job, but if he's the 5th RB on your squad, I think you could be in good shape"
fantasyfootball,3draod,LamanamanumiReborn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yep...all that I pretty much agree. Except for Tre Mason having 600 yds in the first 6 games.

They took him 10th overall because they see him as an extraordinary talent. He might start the season on PUP so you can get 6 good weeks of Mason but that's it. If Gurley doesn't start on PUP he should be the lead back even earlier.  Looking at your comment here, you cannot compare this to Marcus Lattimore, that was one of the worst injuries an RB has ever had. Gurley's ACL tear was a standard one. Not to make light of such a major injury, but ACL tears don't end careers these days. You can be sure the Rams would not have taken him 10th overall if they had any concerns about his long-term recovery."

The difference being if they do believe he is 100% in October I think they will play him and probably play him extensively unless Tre Mason is playing at an extremely high level.

Not to mention the Rams o-line situation is a trainwreck. They drafted 4 linemen if it's any indication regarding their faith in it.. 5 if you count the supplemental pick.  Let's say Gurley goes on PUP for first 6 games okay, fine. Believable.   Mason's schedule out the gate is far from favorable:  Week 1: Seattle last year 3rd in  YDs allowed, 5th in TDs  Week 2: Washington       12th in YDs 14th in TDs  Week 3: Pittsburgh          6th in  YDs  8th in TDs  Week 4: Arizona              13th in YDs 8th in TDs  Finally some relief in Week 5 and 7 vs GB and Cleveland (bye in week 6), but I think it's a far cry to think that you are going to see Mason in any situation to where they wouldn't be ready to insert Gurley in come Week 8.   If want to take Mason and think he is a steal, by all means go for it, but do NOT reach for him. Shouldn't be taking him (based on what we know right now) and earlier than the 110-120 spot...

It doesn't leave many RB1s that are left to draft from. So if I don't keep Hyde then I will have a very weak RB core on my team compared to the rest of the league.

Dez and AJ are both legit top 5 WR's when healthy and CJ has the most potential out of any of those RB's imo. I'm not sold on Murray in Philly, I'm not sold on Hill in Cincy.   But keep an eye out on all 3 RB situations up until you HAVE to pick a RB and choose the one you are most comfortable with, for me it'd be CJ.  You can always draft a JStew, Ellington, Joique Bell type in rounds 4/5 for a RB2 and still have two amazing WR's."

If you want to go RB-RB you're probably better off near the top of the draft so you can get a stud and then grab whoever falls. If you want WR-WR the turn is a good place to try and grab two of the top guys.

fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,halfeatenbagel,2,Sat Jul 18 21:17:04 2015 UTC,I'd really like around the 6th/7th pick.   You can probably pick up Brown or a stud RB that drops if he's already drafted. Then another stud WR(or Anderson if you're high on him) which is always a huge plus having 2 stud WRs in .5ppr leagues.

fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,zjrk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:47:55 2015 UTC,"12 team standard. 7th pick in the first, then drafting out of the first overall slot the rest of the way. Knowing that Justin Forsett will be available for my 2nd/3rd round pick (24/25 overall pick remember) do you go for Arian/AB or someone else besides the top 6 RBs? Would you be okay with Forsett as your #1 RB if you had AB/Gronk/Another top WR and then the next best available at the 24/25 pick (Cobb/TY/Evans/Possibly Alshon)? Really having trouble figuring out this one. But I know my league very well so I'm confident in who will be drafted where. Thanks guys!"
fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,kstan26,2,Sat Jul 18 14:15:21 2015 UTC,I believe that the best player available at 7 will be Brown by a pretty wide margin. I trust him a lot more than any RBs at that spot. I foresee Forsett having a big year so even though I wouldn't be thrilled w/ him as my RB #1 I think Brown and Forsett are a better combo than Foster and Cobb/Evans/Hilton.

fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,jre19,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:07:26 2015 UTC,Definitely go QB if you can. You would have a potential top 5 player at RB WR and QB and that's hard to pass up.

fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,DogeFiend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:48:02 2015 UTC,The best WRs available will probably be Sanders/Cooks/Keenan Allen/Matthews/Watkins. I agree on the QB though. I'm just worried about what might be left at WR later on wen I could still grab rivers/smith/Eli in another round or two
fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,bjbush,2,Sat Jul 18 22:59:55 2015 UTC,Good point.  I think if you can grab one of those first 3 WR and still get Eli later on that might be real good as well.  I think Eli will put up good #'s this year.  Otherwise if you grab brees maybe a chance at Brandon Marshall?
fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,DogeFiend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:01 2015 UTC,I forgot Marshall. He's falling because of the QB situation in NY but he could turn out to be a solid grab. Thanks for the help
fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,bjbush,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:11:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he would be a good pickup if you went QB early if he fell to your next pick. He has been pretty much a top 5 pick last 2 years and only dropped off because of injury last year and QB situation

Should I go Jimmy Graham, TY Hilton, Jordan Matthews, or maybe even McCoy, Lynch, or Murray? Maybe reach for Foster since he probably won't be there my next pick.  I went with Antonio Brown in the first round m so I'm leaning towards another WR or Graham. I'm thinking there will still be value RB's in the 3rd and 4th. Still, don't know if I should pass on a high-value starting RB."
fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,Troop-the-Loop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'd say if every RB above Demarco Murray is off the board look for another good WR. I think 2nd round is too high for Jimmy Graham with no guarantee of a point return. (Wilson doesn't target TE too much, and Marshawn still loves end zone receptions so that takes away from Jimmys production.) I'd look for a WR that could be a steal at Pick 25. I find steals around there would be Julian Edelman, Emanuel Sanders, Brandin Cooks. Most of those should still be on the board while everyone else is grabing Mike Evans, Alshon Jefferey, ect. If you draft 2 WR's first you need 2 that will produce points (Catches, YAC, TDs)  to make up for the lesser RB's you will get in the next rounds. Look for an RB next in Round 3, unless J. Graham is on the board still. If not look for Frank Gore, Joseph Randle, Andre Ellington, Lamar Miller. They'd be an alright RB1 to your 2 Great WR's"

fantasyfootball,3dqjb8,Troop-the-Loop,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:10 2015 UTC,I personally like E. Sanders but my only worry is Mannings durability.

Not saying he wont have a good year, but it definitely wont be like it was last year and definitely won't warrant a 4th round pick. People like Tom Brady, Cam Newton, and Matt Ryan are most likely still on the board and will be in round 5 and 6. Build your roster strength early.

fantasyfootball,3dqjdf,JamalOMW,2,Sat Jul 18 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Big Ben will be the most overrated QB this season. He had TWO amazing games last year. Those two games are what made him in the 'elite' ff QB tier. He only had one other game above 30.   Here's Ben's worst games : 6,13,13,15,12,13,13  That's 7 games where Ben is below average for a QB. I don't trust him, the Steelers also have a brutal schedule all year long. And if I wanted 7 games of 6-15 points I would find someone I like more off waivers.   Ben won't be a top 5 QB this season and that's obvious.   Not to say Matt Ryan is a whole hell of a lot better, he is super inconsistent like you said. But at least he plays in a pretty weak division and has a ton of offensive weapons. I'd take JJ, Roddy, Tamme, over AB, Bryant, Miller anyday.

I'm not sure if the examples he gave are even 100% true, as Jefferies had huge games both with and without Marshall, and the same with Tate/Johnson. The OBJ/Cruz example is probably irrelevant as OBJ was likely to breakout with or without Cruz.  I can't help but feel like the opposing defense would be a major factor as well - if a player becomes the defacto #1, but draws Revis or Haden because of it, it could be a negative - whereas in other situations it could be a positive.  Though it is funny to hear the situation be used by experts to support both sides."

Basically this is a recent history of the top 10 in my league for each position. (6pt td, qb/2rb/2wr/flex/te/k/def). Essentially it compares the top 2-10 to the top 1 in a lot of ways, and the value tied to the top 10 from a raw points perspective. It does not do much to compare total pts vs other positions.  Key data points:  Avg pts BHL - essentially this compares each ranks weekly average to the top player in their position group and gives you their average number of weekly points behind the leader.  Diff - this takes that players weekly average and compares it to the weekly average of the entire top 10 combined. If only the top 3 players are in the positive for a position group, generally they are going to be more valuable from a situation perspective. This would give you good insight if you like to play from the perspective of maximizing your points per position each season.  ABHL - basically I take the average of the average weekly points behind the leader for ranks 2-10 to get this number. A higher number indicates the relative value of having the TOP positional group player vs the average or middle of the pack."

I thought about looking at auction $$$ to quantify start values by year (ie $25 wr in 2009,2010..2014), and then compare the probability of being a notable at their respective position.(WR3,2,1) For example, a result I would like to see is something like ""Historically a $35 wr has a 10% chance of finishing in the top 5, 20% of top 10, 35% of top 15,..etc"" a $35 RB has a 5% chance of finishing in the top 5...15% chance of finishing in the top 20""...a $5 WR has a 1% chance of finishing in the top 10, a $5 RB has a 5% chance of finishing in the top 10  Maybe difficult for me to explain, but I'd like to see where risk and reward potentials lie, as in which stock to invest.......penny stocks (fliers) of RBs have a higher rate of success than penny QB or WRs.   With this info, I think I would be able to see how the market prices players versus return potential, and then look for any opportunities to build a team with the higher historic probability of success."

So, a suggestion of mine would be looking for any statistical evidence of a rookie being successful in the NFL. Are there certain schools, coaches, or schemes that transfer the best? Are there types of play that transcend? Are there any nfl scouting attributes that consistently result in talented play?  Alternatively, what can we expect from injured players? Are there injuries that are consistently resulting in permanent degradation of performance? Is there a style of healing that provides a player with the best chance of returning 100% (eg. Is surgery and a year off statistically better than a summer in pt)? Are there any schemes or playing styles that are kinder to injured or injury prone players (looking at you Chip)?"

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,kpachla02,79,Fri Jul 17 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"Qb:   TB12: ik he's missing time, but still u can mix and match for the first few weeks)  Teddy Bridgewater: AP is back, which could actually help bridge waters production. his WRs are better this year, Wallace is there and Charles Johnson should build on his rookie season  Eli Manning: you have to think with Odell, Cruz, and even Randle in the mix, he'll have a productive year. He was pretty good towards the end of last season once he became more familiar with mcadoo's offense  other names i like (albeit not as much as the guys i listed): Tanehill, Ryan, Winston  RB:  Melvin Gordon: I realize he's a rookie, but based on the amount of success rookies have had in the past few years, i think we can worry less about whether his collegiate game will translate to the NFL. The dude is talented. He's got great measurables and lands in a great situation. Rivers is a great QB and the O line has improved. Ryan Mathews was very productive in the past when healthy. Gordon is more talented in my eyes, can stay healthy, and is playing behind a better line.   LG Blount. I realize that its the patriots, but his ADP is so low and this backfield is clearer than it has been in the past. Blount is clearly ahead of Gray for the big back role, and ridley and vereen are gone.  Lamar Miller. I've gotten on the Miller train very recently after doing a lot of research about him. some of the things that worried me were his backup, Jay Ajayi who was drafted in the 5th round but is actually a talented RB. The workload also bothered me, as he's never really gotten a big in the Lazor offense. However, i did some research and realized that in terms of his production, he's been one of the most effective when you consider the number of touches he's gotten. This is also a contract year for him. Perhaps Lazor ups in workload since he knows Miller is leaving next year. Perhaps Ajayi was simply drafted for depth and to be the lead back next year once Miller leaves. Again, i've only gotten on the miller train recently so if anyone has some additional insight that would be great. the question marks are still there, but his floor and ceiling are higher than someone like Mark Ingram or Jonathan Stewart.   Other names I like: J Stewart, CJ Spiller (PPR), Roy Helu (PPR), Rashad Jennings  WR:   Alshon Jeffrey: I think he could be in for a big year and he's a little cheaper than the others. Marshall is gone, and while defenses might hone in on jeffrey a little more (which is doubtful cause defenses still have to look at Bennet and Forte) I think being in the WR1 role could be a huge bonus to his production.  Gase (former OC for denver) has shown in the past that he featurs the WR1 heavily in his offense  Jarvis Landry (PPR) - his value in a standard isn't so good, but he could rack up catches with wallace out of the picture. Plus, him and tanehill really developed a good rapport 2nd half of last year. Not a very high ceiling, but a very solid floor in PPR. I think hes like a much cheaper, slighly less upside version of Cooks  Jordan Mathews: Maclin is gone. he is talented and bradford can be good when healthy. i'm buying him as my WR2.  Nelson Aghlor: like Mathews, he could be in for a solid year.   Other names: Calvin, Boldin, T Williams, M Floyd, K Allen  TE:   Owen Daniels: Peyton loves his TEs. Daniels isn't particularly skilled, but he's being drafted as the 15th best TE. decent value here  Other names: Walker, Cameron  sorry this is so long lol"

Yes a goal line threat and he blocks well. To me bb will use him heavy this season as not the work horse but the rb leader as was the firm and Ridley in prior seasons.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,theshowstoppa34,7,Sat Jul 18 18:47:41 2015 UTC,Good list.  I'm worried about Miller not getting the carries but he is going for soooo cheap with top 8 upside and a solid floor that you almost have to take him
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,bulldoozer,3,Fri Jul 17 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"really worried about this also. u/Marathoner2010/ gave a good explanation that i read earlier today. towards the end of last year, Miller got a pretty decent workload (i believe it was around 18 - 20 touches on avarege last 3 weeks). with him going into a contract year, perhaps they really run him to the ground? also, this is the first year that Miller is the starter. In years past, he's always had to evelate into that role. Since he's in the lead back role at the very start, perhaps that alone could bump up his workload"

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,blurgpatrol,2,Sat Jul 18 03:30:04 2015 UTC,Quality post - totally agree with most listed here. Keep an eye on Owen Daniels through preseason though - word out of camp is that he could see reduced snaps due to his age. Combine that with more emphasis on the run (or if Peyton misses any time because he is an almost 40-year-old playing a sport where men on steroids beat the hell out of each other) and Daniels could put up some pretty low numbers this year.

Even though he was ineffective, based on the depth chart, it was easy to predict he'd be the lead dog. this yr, Bill really doesnt have another option if he wants to run and blount has shown that he can be a very effective back in this league. Some people are worried about Gray, but if Blount cant get it done, then Gray cant either. they are very similar players, but blount is better.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,Barian_Fostate,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:40 2015 UTC,Shit man just because they traded up for him we should value him more. That is some good reasoning. He's from Wisconsin and that college SUCKS at producing RBs.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dawgsjw,0,Sat Jul 18 02:54:43 2015 UTC,Lol Gurley is the one who can't block for shit. He'll be fine in pass pro in the long term. He was reliable in college as well.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,Barian_Fostate,5,Sat Jul 18 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Gurley can't block?  Gurley played in a pro style offense at UGA and got many chances to block for the qb.  I really don't remember any plays at UGA where Gurley missed badly at blocks that cost the qb a sack.   So I don't see how you can say Gurley can't block for shit.  Gurley could block for UGA.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dawgsjw,0,Sat Jul 18 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"Uh...just because he played in a pro style offense doesn't mean he could block. Gordon played in a pro style offense too, but he was much more disciplined when it came to eating grass, staying square, and shooting into the chest. I'll go grab my notes and show you several examples of Gurley's blown blocks. He was terrible at it."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,RIPSweetPrince,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"I want to say maybe his freshman yr, he didn't do as well, but I still never really seen him do real bad, except when he tried to block Clowney.    Also, I'm gonna need to see this proof you have for calling him terrible at it.    "" Another aspect I liked when breaking down Gurley was pass protection. His ability to take on linebackers should at least give him a better shot to stay on the field on third down early in his NFL career!"""
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,Barian_Fostate,0,Sat Jul 18 05:06:47 2015 UTC,Check the track record for Wisconsin RBs. It's a college friendly system towards RBs and they all fail when they get to the NFL.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,buythefield,2,Sat Jul 18 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, but neither do spread or option offenses. Tre Mason came from an option system and he did just fine as a runner in his rookie year. Adrian Peterson played in both spread AND pro style systems while at Oklahoma.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dawgsjw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:19:40 2015 UTC,All of those cardinals receivers have huge potential is the problem. He is still lined up as WR3 in that offense. Larry Fitz is going MASSIVELY undervalued. The major question in all of it is... can Palmer stay healthy?
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,caiiiius,0,Fri Jul 17 19:28:31 2015 UTC,"I think that has been the question every yr w/ Ari lately, and the answer has always been, No Palmer can't stay healthy for a full 16 games."

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,TheObnoxiousOne,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:04 2015 UTC,"The last 4 years, Palmer has only played the whole season at qb.  Also, qb seems to be one of the positions where you don't see too many injuries, especially when you considered the rules that are now in place that protect the qb even more.    In 2011, he played 10 games.  2012, 15 games....2013, 16 games...2014, only 6 games.    So 2 out of 4 seasons he has played less than 65% of the games.  However my point that Palmer can't stay healthy for 16 games is true.  1 out of the last 4 proves that."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,DC_Billiever,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:05:32 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of the statistics you just referenced.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,fellinsoccer14,0,Sat Jul 18 15:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah he stayed healthy for 16 games only 1 time the past 4 seasons, so for someone to question his ability to play a full season is very much legit."

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,Storm_Johnson,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:38 2015 UTC,All I know is I'm really trying to get Allen Robinson.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,MigratedCoconut,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:59 2015 UTC,I like the Eli pick....unless OBJ has a sophomore slump
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,mbuff,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"This year here are some of my targets, mostly in later rounds:  QB - Rivers, Romo - I think the SD offense is going to be good, and if Gordon stays healthy and productive I think it will be one of Rivers' best and most consistent years in recent memory. Romo is still behind a great O-line and is throwing to Witten and Dez; I believe he has a really high floor if healthy.  RB-Martin, Woodhead, Abdullah - I don't think TB will be any good this year, but I firmly believe that Martin will be the bell-cow back this year. Sheer volume alone makes it worth taking him in the 8th or 9th round. Woodhead should be great for PPR leagues, especially with an ADP so low. I think Abdullah will take over most of the rushing duties in Detroit by the end of the year. May be going a bit too high in some leagues, but could be a great find in the 7th round or lower.  WR- Garcon, Michael Floyd, Mike Wallace - RG3 is back and even if he isn't very good, Garcon will probably see a huge increase compared to last year, especially in PPR leagues. I think if Palmer plays the whole year that Floyd will have a good year. I think he will be the best fantasy WR on the team, and his ADP is low enough this year that the risk is worth it. Last year he was going in the 4th, now he is going much later and the value makes sense. Mike Wallace is in a better situation for his skillset (run deep and beat his man), so I think he will have a good year. Still may be boom-or-bust on the week-to-week, but his ADP may make him worth targeting this year.  TE - Julius Thomas - I think the Jags will be better than most people think (that could be a 6-10 team) and he will see a lot of red zone targets. I think 800 yards and 8 TDs is his floor this year, and he could definitely end up with 1,000 yards and 12 TDs. Based on his floor, I would take him in a heartbeat at his current ADP."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dusting53,6,Fri Jul 17 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"JT- I think 800 yards and 8 TDs is his floor this year   You do know he's never even reached 800 yards ever in the NFL while under Peyton Manning right?  While he had 12 TD's last year, he only had 489 yards."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,ComedicFailure,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:04 2015 UTC,PFM but also DT/Decker and DT/Sanders ahead of him.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,mbuff,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"No, he hasn't hit 800 yards in his career. However, he should be a huge part of the Jax offense and more of his production will likely come from making plays as they go down the field, rather than being just a huge redzone threat (like he was with Manning). Hence why I think he will have more yards and fewer TDs than previous years, with the possibility for more if the offense really gets going this year."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,ComedicFailure,5,Sat Jul 18 09:15:52 2015 UTC,could not agree more with this post.
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,mbuff,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:02 2015 UTC,Why Abdullah over J. Bell?
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,mmmdddmmm,3,Sun Jul 19 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Abdullah is the more talented back, and it should just be a matter of time before he takes over most of the running duties. Also, even if it just ends up being a 50-50 split between Bell and Abdullah, getting Bell in the 4th-5th round is a worse value than getting Abdullah in the 6th-7th. Although he is a rookie, I feel like there is less risk and more to be gained as opposed to Bell, who is a higher risk with more to lose."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,CptBurbagio,2,Sat Jul 18 00:22:21 2015 UTC,But Bell had some great games last season in Bush's absence. How are you so easily dismissive?
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,JshMcDwll,2,Sat Jul 18 13:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yes he did. However, Bell and Bush had different roles in the offense. Detroit still has Riddick as well. Abdullah is a good pass-catching back and has been a solid runner in college. Abdullah's weak spot is pass blocking, and if he gets that shored up, then he will probably be seeing more time on the field. He will also need to show good ball security, which coaches can help him with. Another issue against Bell - he's slightly under 4.0 YPC each of the last 2 seasons. I think Bell will still be used, don't get me wrong. But Bell's stock is definitely not rising and a time-share for a RB getting 10-15 carries a game at under 4.0 YPC does not give me confidence in Bell, especially in the 4th round."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,heis22,3,Sun Jul 19 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"QB: Ryan Tannehill is my dude. This is the year where he makes the Leap. Bold prediction: Tanny finishes the year top 5, behind some conglomerate of Rodgers, Wilson, Luck, and Matty Ice.    Guys I want but won't write about: Matt Ryan, Tony Romo, Eli Manning  RB: Gio Bernard, especially if I grab Jeremy Hill early on. Gio has way too much talent (to the degree that a fantasy player can analyze the game, this dude passes the eye test), and has good value in PPR leagues. Bold prediction: both guys finish in the top 20 RB's this year.  Honorable Mentions: Justin Forsett, TJ Yeldon, Devonta Freeman  WR: Truthfully? I don't think the move to Kansas City kills Jeremy Maclin's value. Now, his touchdown numbers will probably drop, and his yardage may take a hit, but I think he's a good bet to lead the league in receptions this year. A poor man's Antonio Brown, he is. Bold prediction: Maclin is a top 5 WR in PPR formats, WR1 in standard.  Runners up: Mike Wallace, Pierre Garcon, Allen Hurns (irrationally so)  TE: If I miss out on Gronk, Olsen, or Black Unicorn, I wait til round 13 and grab Delanie Walker. Walker finished as fantasy's #8 TE last year, and with Tennessee not bringing anyone of note in, he will probably be the #1 option on the team for the second year in a row. Bold prediction: Walker scores at least 5 points in every game this year.   Just missed the cut: Kyle Rudolph, Jason Witten"
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,heis22,2,Sun Jul 19 21:15:19 2015 UTC,"I want to think what you say about Maclin is true, but I am fearful.  Can't wait to see some preseason games for a sense.  Mike Clay has him at 40 overall for PPR (which applies to the league where I'd consider him closely), but I'm just worried the conservative nature of that offense, and the good D keeping scores low, plus the targets that JC and Kelce will get, kills alot of what's to hopefully love about his value in KC."

Don't really know too much about him, but at his value I'm taking a flier on him.  WR: Victor Cruz. You can grab him in the 10th round in ESPN drafts.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,jlo47,8,Sun Jul 19 06:51:19 2015 UTC,Brady isn't top 5 because he is suppose to be suspended for the first 4 games. You really think Belichick will be committed to just Blount?
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dongswanson,2,Sat Jul 18 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"He got rid of Ridley and Vareen and didnt really replace them with anyone, so he has the chance of being a solo back which is rare now a days.

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,dusting53,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Blount has some value, but I wouldn't say as much as you think. Bolden (Belichick likes his ST, but Bolden will play actual RB snaps in a pinch) and Jonas Gray (maybe not as sure) will be back, they haven't given up James White quite yet, and Travaris Cadet was brought in also presumably as a receiving back. Add to that Tyler Gaffney, whom the Pats thought enough of to claim off of Carolina's IR waivers and pay for an entire year on IR, and you have quite the RB uncertainty."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,DeadhardyAQ,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:20:03 2015 UTC,"pats fan here. Gray and Blount have similar playing styles. Only difference is that Blount is better. If Blount can't do it, then Gray can't either.  Ridley and Vereen walked this offseason, which signals to me that Bill believes that he has his guy. Cadet/White is going to be the passing back, its clear that Blounts value lies in his ability to get garbage time yards and TDs - which could make him a top 15 RB"
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,bulldoozer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:23:39 2015 UTC,"Suspension or not, I wouldn't put him in my top 5. In the past two years he's had 11 games where he's scored less that 12 points.   Granted he did have a great end to the year last year, but with the way belechik schemes around the opposition, he's bound to put up more bad weeks than his talent would suggest."
fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,Ubitquitus,3,Fri Jul 17 19:33:25 2015 UTC,"Eh. Probably close but my top 5 are Luck, Rodgers, Wilson, Manning, and Brees."

fantasyfootball,3dnm9q,tzimme4,0,Fri Jul 17 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"QB: Teddy Throwsevelt. With Mike Wallace and AD, Teddy has more options than ever and was hot as Hansel at the end of the season.  RB: Tevin Coleman. Ripped off a ton of long runs in college and could benefit from the Falcons' screen pass game.  RB: Demarco Murray. I know it said not top 5, but so many people don't have him above 9, which I think is ridiculous. The Eagles' o-line is just as good as Dallas' and they had to deal with more injuries last year. Only thing that worries me is Chip pulling him from the goal line, but he can thrive in a zone blocking system.  WR: Amari Cooper. Derek Carr could be a 4000+ yard passer and Cooper reminds a lot of people of Julio.  WR: Jeremy Maclin. Yes, I know KC receivers didn't catch one single pass TD last season. But Maclin was drafted by Reid and was his No. 1, I think he opens the playbook and Maclin benefits from the constant threat of JC. He's going in the 7th-8th rounds, and I think he's valuable enough for the fifth at least."

If they do, kick him out before he has a chance to pay.   Sounds like you'll be doing him a favor.   That's the democratic way. Your other option is to put up his last complaint for a vote, when it fails lock him out and tell everyone he quit based on your last conversation with him stating as much."
fantasyfootball,3dqjeo,pulgitag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"I think I know the solution, I just want other opinions.  We're starting our third keeper league season. During this offseason was the first time that draft picks for potential keepers were traded. I run this league as democratically as possible. Everyone has the option to vote. In the case of a tie, I repeal my vote. 12 teams.  Example: Devonta Freeman(7th round value) + 15th round pick for a 10th round pick  Enter Red. Red complained year one about the roster restrictions. Understandable, but we all have the same rules. The next offseason, we voted them out. He threatened ""Redraft or I'm out"". Seeing as this is a keeper league, I said ""no redraft"". He didn't leave. There were defensive yards allowed that were voted in. I vocally was against it, but the league voted to keep it. Including Red. During the Thursday night Tampa/Atlanta game, he would text me the entire night stating ""Change it. This league is a joke. Change it now or I'm out"". I said ""No changes until the offseason"". He complains about trade raping and said aloud ""I'm vetoing all trades just because"".   Now the current issue. He texts me when there's a trade on the table, telling me I should repeal it automatically. Luck (4th round value)+ 15th rounder for a 5th round pick. He said that this is ridiculous and the league was going to collapse due to the lack of a player pool. Mind you, I lobbied hard for smaller benches (Reduced to 6) and we changed the RB2 to a Flex position, therefore increasing the flexibility of players AND increasing the player pool by 12.   I told him ""I'm not a dictator"" and to rally votes to veto. He did so. On Sunday he texts me without end saying that all of these trades should stop or he would quit. He tried to go about it democratically, but he wouldn't even hear me out. When he said he would quit, I texted ""k"" and stopped responding.   I have two potential replacements, maybe a third. He and his bitching about the rules has caused one person to quit already. I don't consider him much of a friend anymore (in addition to a few other personal reasons) because of this and how he just texts incessantly over a rule that only he cares about.   In my mind if he hasn't paid within the  next week, I'll tell him he has until August 1st. Or his spot is up for grabs for the next person that pays.   Thoughts?"

fantasyfootball,3dpbhx,theDarkAngle,3,Sat Jul 18 08:31:36 2015 UTC,"C.J. should likely be a 3-down back, but I'd imagine Thompson and Ball to be sort of even on the depth chart behind him with Thompson having a more red-zone role. I'm not quite back in full on 100% fantasy football mode where I feel extremely confident about stuff like this but IIRC Denver used Thompson a decent amount in the red-zone and he got I believe 3 or 4 TDs when I thought CJ was fully capable of making similar plays. It was sort of how the Eagles used Chris Polk, who I believe vultured about 4 TDs from Shady. I fully expect CJ Anderson to be Denvers feature back but with the Juwan Thompson threat and the fact they probably still want to get some use out of Montee Ball to justify their relatively high draft pick on him a couple years ago, I think it makes CJA a bit of a risky lower end RB1."

fantasyfootball,3dpbhx,mvp725,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:01 2015 UTC,"Ha, see. Ronnie Hillman honestly slipped my mind when it came to the Broncos RB depth chart. Makes Anderson seem even more risky as I have no idea where Thompson, Ball and Hillman fall behind CJA on their depth chart. Perhaps one of them may wind up being cut but they all seem like potential contributors that could take away value from Anderson."

fantasyfootball,3dplty,Cantstop991,7,Sun Jul 19 06:58:55 2015 UTC,"As a 49ers fan, I think people are a little too hard on him but I don't like his ADP. It's really hard to put words to how inept the offense was last year, so I think there is really nowhere to go but up for the 49ers offense, including the RB. That being said, ESPN has him as the 40th overall player or something like that, but I'm a little hesitant drafting him until the late 5th early 6th round. The 49ers signed Reggie Bush and Kendall Hunter has always stolen carries when he was healthy. I would say Hyde is the first and second down back and Bush and Hunter split the 3rd down/pass catching duties with each of them stealing a few carries here and there, but Hyde will get the redzone/goal line carries. I'm not as down on him as many, but I think he is predicted as going a round too high for me."
fantasyfootball,3dplty,relaxitschill,3,Sat Jul 18 07:20:55 2015 UTC,"Are you confident using him as your RB 2 or do you view him as more of a flex? I stashed him late last year knowing Gore would be gone, now I'm trying to decide who to keep, him, Joique Bell, Bernard.  Hill is my number 1 back, but it's a PPR league so Gio still has value as a flex play, Bell is my least favorite of the bunch given his history of mediocrity and how everyone is raving about Abdullah in Detroit."
fantasyfootball,3dplty,big_willy24,2,Sat Jul 18 11:20:37 2015 UTC,"Yea I am pretty confident he will be a solid RB2. He's the starter on a still very talented team. People keep raving about how the 49ers lost all these players but looks at the offensive line situation last year: Anthony Davis was injured almost all year anyway and Iupati was terrible.   The 49ers have drafted and basically redshirted Brandon Thomas and Marcus Martin to replace Goodwin and Iupati. If anything I think the line is a little bit better, barring injuries. Hyde will probably get something like 17-25 carries a game. At worst he puts up an average YPC and a few touchdowns, at best he realizes the potential he showed last year and shows everyone why he was the best RB in his draftclass and balls out. I'm confident he's a solid RB2. I'm not sold as Hill as your RB1 though."
fantasyfootball,3dplty,relaxitschill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:02:24 2015 UTC,"Do you view hill as more of a RB 2 as well or are you thinking Bernard is going to win the starting job back? Think it would be worth it to keep hill and Bernard? My 5 keepers right now are Rodgers/Evans/Matthews/Hill/Hyde with Joique Bell and Bernard the odd men out, it's a 0.5 PPR league and I pick 2nd overall after keepers"
fantasyfootball,3dplty,big_willy24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:20 2015 UTC,"I would say he is top tier RB2, but that being said I think the only real RB1's are : AD, Bell, Charles, Lynch, Lacy, Murray, and Foster. I don't know much about the Cincinnati backfield situation but I just don't trust a RB when his ""handcuff"" or ""3rd down back"" is a 7th round pick and considered a steal. I don't think he has the position locked down. Just like Gio if he has a few bad games in a row and it could be back to 3rd down and goal line duties. That being said, I agree with the players you are keeping. I value Hyde much higher than Bernard and Bell, and you can probably pick them up sometime later in your draft if you are worried. Just my 2 cents."
fantasyfootball,3dplty,relaxitschill,3,Sat Jul 18 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"To me, he's in the same tier as TJ Yeldon. Unproven guy who gets the starting job on a silver platter but is in a bad offense on a team that is gonna play from behind a lot. At his current ADP I'm avoiding him. But if he starts falling, he's still a RB who is not in a committee(Assuming Bush sucks) and he might become a good value pick."

Although you can't predict injuries, there's no arguing that both reggie and kendall have a history of getting hurt. Also, Carlos supposedly showed up in great shape, having lost about 15 lbs to fit the new run scheme (leveon bell anybody?). He also passed the eye test for me. He runs hard, breaks tackles, doesn't dance around in the backfield, decent vision and knows how to get positive yardage. He's a prototypical west coast back and I personally like his upside enough to justify his ADP."

Yes, Bush was out of commission for a good part of last season because of ankle injury, but the games he was healthy he was what the Lions wanted out of him.  I think he's just going earlier than I'd rank him. I'll let someone else take him.  If I'm still needing a second starting RB and they're almost all off the board except for him at his ADP I'm probably happier with Blount or Jennings in later rounds."

That won't change just because other parts of the receiving corps has changed. He's 32 and will continue to regress. He hasn't hit 1,000 yards or 6 TDs in the past two years. He played 16 games last year and didn't hit 100 targets.  Cooks is the only WR you want on that team."
fantasyfootball,3do707,fytfootball,7,Fri Jul 17 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"There is a big difference between fantasy stud and fantasy relevant. He was pretty much a stud when he put up two straight WR11 (standard) seasons in '11 and '12.  He was definitely fantasy relevant the last two seasons finishing as WR27 and WR33. Especially so in the second half. He had 600 yards and 4 TD over the final 8 games in 2013 and then had at least 7 points in each of the final 6 games last year.  This tells me that he is still capable of decent numbers and worth owning. Even with Cooks back in action, Colston is likely to be a vital part of the Saints offense following the departures of Graham and Stills. I definitely would agree if you said you don't want to be starting Colston regularly, but this is a great guy to have on your bench."

fantasyfootball,3do707,garrettastic,4,Sat Jul 18 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"I like to take at least one relatively safe pick coupled with a couple high upside players for my bench WRs. In a 12 team league I've never seen Colston available on the waiver wire and he's not going undrafted, so not really an option as an in-season pick up."
fantasyfootball,3do707,Thehawkiscock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"With fewer targets than usual for Brees, Colston could be the one whose value could blow up.  Sure, they're clearly changing into a more balanced offense, but Graham's presence will need to be replaced by someone -- why not Colston? Not saying he'll put up Graham numbers, but the circumstances are there for Colston to not disappoint.  Plus unless you're playing in a 8-man or completely likeminded 10-man league he isn't going undrafted."
fantasyfootball,3do707,KoalaExpress,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"Finishing the season as WR33 doesn't make him the 33rd best fantasy WR. He played the entire season so that final ranking came from slow, consistent points. There were receivers who finished below him who were much more relevant. An example would be Brian Quick, and pretty much every WR who was putting up good numbers but had injuries. You don't take a 0 when they are injured, you play someone else.  Having flex upside is not a player I want to talk about. I would rather start a guy like Michael Floyd who is going to give you 2 points or 12 points any given week, instead of Colston's consistent 6 points."
fantasyfootball,3do707,fytfootball,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"If you read my full comment you saw that I mentioned he had at least 7 points in each of the final 6 games including three games in double digits so your whole point about Colston being a slow steady trickle of points doesn't hold. Colston's final 6 games were better than Quick's 7 (Almost as many yards with one extra touchdown) so again he was every bit as relevant as Quick, slightly more in fact for a longer stretch. Quick had 4 relevant games and even before being injured did nothing in his final 2 games, not counting the game in which he was injured.  Colston's success directly followed the season ending injury to Brandin Cooks. While Cooks is back, Graham and Stills are gone which means Colston will have an opportunity to grab extra targets and once again provide more upside than he's being given credit for."
fantasyfootball,3do707,Thehawkiscock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:13:12 2015 UTC,"7 points is not a good fantasy performance. That's bench material. That's exactly what I would call a slow steady trickle of points.  And do you wanna look at the rest of his season or keep cherry picking the weeks that support your argument?  Quick's numbers were not quite what I had remembered, so perhaps that is not a great example.  Colston's final weeks were very reliant on TDs. After Week 7 he never had more than 82 yards. Not what I'm looking for in an aging WR.  The extra targets argument is relevant, but I don't think it will be enough. He's been ineffective so I think those targets will go elsewhere. Don't forget Pierre Thomas was injured last year and now they have Spiller which will add a new element to their offense, theoretically bringing them back to the Sproles era. They are going to run the ball with Ingram on 1st, check it down to Spiller on 2nd, and throw to Cooks on 3rd. Those are probably the top 3 targets, and we don't even know that they will ignore the TE position just because Graham gone. Colston is, at best, 4th in line for touches."
fantasyfootball,3do707,fytfootball,0,Mon Jul 20 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"Again you're ignoring the fact that I said at least 7 points in each of those games.  And I'm cherry picking those six games for a number of reasons. I acknowledge Colston was lackluster in the early part of the season but: 1.) Your argument was that Colston was providing a consistent 6 points all season long, 2.) You were using the small sample size of Brian Quick who was already falling off before his injury and 3.) It was directly related to the disappearance of Cooks and led to an increase in targets. Specifically in the final four games he saw 6+ targets in each game while having just 6+ targets in four of the previous 12 games. That's the kind of target volume I expect in 2015 and in those 4 games he paced for 72-1072-8. Small sample size and those numbers don't blow you away but that is definitely upside I can use on my team.  If you want to debate his target volume that's fine, I just didn't like the original argument that Colston lacks upside. I deliberately ignored the RB position targets because I don't think they have any effect on Colston. Thomas and Travaris Cadet combined for 93 targets last year and those are the targets I give to C.J. Spiller. I agree they don't ignore the tight end position but I feel pretty good that they don't come particularly close to the 168 tight end targets last year. Those extra targets probably go to Cooks and Colston with maybe a little Spiller and WR3 sprinkled in.   Even with Drew Brees' passing attempts falling off a bit there will still be a LOT of targets to go around. It's definitely debatable where those targets go so I'm okay with that argument but Colston was effective in games in which he saw 6+ targets, averaging just over 74 yards a game in 8 such games. I do believe Colston will be a big beneficiary of the targets to go around and so I think people will be surprised with what he does this year."

fantasyfootball,3do707,cowmandude,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:49 2015 UTC,"Colston is just one of those guys now that is usually worth a roster spot in most 10+ man leagues but the guy who owns him is never excited about it. Unless Colston gets close to, say, 25 catches, 300 yards and a couple TDs in the first 4 games of '15 you're never going to feel confident starting him even in your flex. I'd say just let some other sucker take the fall and waste a roster spot on him in the 7th - 10th rounds and go for a younger guy with more upside like Landry, K. White, Cooper, A. Robinson, etc.  I agree with you on Cooks. I'm definitely looking for him if he's around in the late 3rd or 4th and can easily fall lower than that in many drafts."
fantasyfootball,3do707,TagProNitro,6,Sat Jul 18 08:38:10 2015 UTC,"Drew Brees will benefit the most from the Graham/Unger trade. Most of the pressure against the Saints came up the middle. With less pressure in the pocket, it'll lower the amount of INT & increase the scoring opportunites. Also, it will help the running game out. The one year Brees didn't throw over 4500 yards with the Saints was the year they won the Super Bowl.   Just watching mini-camp from the sidelines either Seantavius Jones or Brandon Coleman will benefit. Nick Toon is a bust and Colston won't rejuvenate over a year."
fantasyfootball,3do707,tzimme4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:01:29 2015 UTC,"Drew and the RBs. As a Saints fan, I've never seen Drew get pressured up the middle so consistently throughout a season. The center of the line was atrocious last season. I love most of the moves the Saints have made this season. The improved OL and running game can give Drew a play action aspect and make him even more deadly. Here's to hoping."
fantasyfootball,3do707,Megawatts19,3,Sat Jul 18 19:15:37 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting Colston to go undrafted in my 10-man and really late in my 14-man.  He's nothing more than a bye-week fill-in WR IMO.    I don't know that Bennett will really be anything more than what he has been.   Eddie Royal is a decent enough WR2 and Forte is enough of a threat in the backfield that Jeffery will probably put up some fine WR1 numbers.  I'm personally not investing in Bennett unless he falls to me in the late part of the mid rounds, like say round 11."
fantasyfootball,3do707,DoubleUglyWhisperer,2,Fri Jul 17 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"Bennett most likely won't improve on last year stats wise, Jeffrey will be healthy (he was banged up a fair bit last year) and Gase/Fox should be more competent than Trestman last year was at calling plays.    In NO Colston still has a lot of competition from players like Cooks, personally I think he won't improve much but he won't regress"

fantasyfootball,3do02o,barrdown,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"This is the sense I've been getting in 14 man drafts too. Mid/late pick in the 1st leads to rosters I'm generally happier with.  Consider in a snake draft your 4th round pick # vs. your position:  1st - 56th  2nd - 55th  3rd - 54th  4th - 53rd  ......  11th - 46th  12th - 45th  13th - 44th  14th - 43rd  Go first and your 4th pick is well past a lot of the RBs/WRs you not only want to start, but even some backup plans. My hope would be that people get frantic over getting QBs and will take Brees/Roethlisberer/Ryan/Romo before you got to pick 56 overall. The wheel at 56/57 loses its luster when a lot of the players in that realm are question marks or depth. Certainly few if any are ones you're very content with starting. Can't really go wrong with a lot of the players there.  It's also why i'd much rather have the 3rd/4th or even 5th pick, if I'm to draft earlier. You could roll the dice on AD/Lacy/Charles and not really care which one you get (league scoring aside of course).

Starting in Week 4 Bell is, theoretically, the most valuable player in fantasy. Without the suspension his ADP would be #1 without a doubt.  The first 3 weeks of the fantasy season are also the least important. That's when everyone is still figuring out which highly drafted players are busts and which have just not gotten into their groove yet. You've also got players like Laurent Robinson fucking with everyone in week 1. Players become more consistent and reliable as the season goes on simply due to having a larger sample size. Good fantasy players can lose the early weeks before they've had time to mold their roster with FA pickups and trades. Furthermore, teams with championship aspirations should place a lot more weight on playoff week talent. A lot of good fantasy players can make the playoffs every year but you gotta have the studs in the final weeks to get that ring.  Now, I'm not saying I think he should be #1 off the board.

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:07 2015 UTC,Yeps. Sucks too because I'm not owning him this year.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Canadaismyhat,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:46:03 2015 UTC,"So overall #1 pick and then another mid round pick to get a 1st round RB 80% of the time and a ~4th round RB 20% of the time? If you got both with one pick, fine, but unless I was already determined to handcuff I'm not wasting a second pick just to start a backup RB for 3 games."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,qp0n,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:01 2015 UTC,DeAngelo Williams is going at RB45 with an overall ADP of 127 so I don't know why you are expecting to use a 4th on him. You can probably get him in the 10th. And it would be wise to handcuff your RB1 regardless of the suspension.  Look at the alternatives. If you draft Jamaal Charles you are also drafting Knile Davis (RB47). If you draft Adrian Peterson you are also drafting Jerick McKinnon (RB57). The prices are comparable.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,-4,Fri Jul 17 22:32:27 2015 UTC,When starting he is a ~4th round RB. And no you don't always handcuff every RB1. Not everyone plays in 10 team standard leagues and handcuffing is dead bench weight when everyone else is jockeying for the breakout players the first few weeks.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,qp0n,3,Fri Jul 17 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't say you need to handcuff every RB1. Just the best handcuffs. In competitive leagues all of the handcuffs I named will be drafted, and more. While you are correct that handcuffs are less important early in the season when speculative bench space is precious, handcuffs are an investment as their value rises every week. In my leagues if the Charles owner doesn't draft Knile Davis, someone else surely will. And they will hold him until the Charles owner is ready to take out his wallet. Sniping handcuffs is a very safe and consistent strategy that I haven't seen discussed on this sub.  I still don't understand why you think you need to draft DeAngelo in the 4th."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,-6,Fri Jul 17 22:48:57 2015 UTC,"I still don't understand why you think you need to draft DeAngelo in the 4th.   I still don't understand why you haven't read my comments. Not only did I never once say he'd be drafted in the 4th, but I even why I mentioned the 4th."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,qp0n,4,Fri Jul 17 22:49:53 2015 UTC,"I have read your comments, I think there is just a communication issue."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,2,Fri Jul 17 22:54:37 2015 UTC,"non-PPR I am not sure but the argument can be made for PPR. AP just spent a year off and you can't know how he'll come back (although I do like AP), feels like every year we're talking about Lynch's down fall and this could be the year, Charles was injured last year behind a below average Oline and the touches are adding up, Lacy had a good year last year but had concussion problems the one before. There is a knock against every top guy. My biggest pro Bell argument is that you should be able to field a competitive team even if your number one is missing. What are you going to do when he has a bye, concede defeat? Going 1-2 is far from a death sentence and if your team goes 0-3 without Bell you might have bigger problems than a Bell suspension."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,lookallama,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:49:37 2015 UTC,once he comes back from the suspension he will be healthy and ready to go. I fully expect him to finish top 2 even with the suspension.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,donnylong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"Anyone who isn't seriously considering drafting Le'Veon Bell #1 overall simply wasn't paying attention last year. I can point to at least 4-5 weeks where he won my matchup by himself. It's hard to predict who is going to finish as the #1 overall RB, so if we can't see into that future, you have to pick based on potential upside, and I don't understand why someone wouldn't want the guy who showed a 30pt+ upside in standard scoring last year. He is the 3 down back in Pittsburgh, which is an increasingly rare quality, and that offense is looking extra scary this year. You gotta draft him confidently."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,jamesmarsden,9,Mon Jul 20 20:40:40 2015 UTC,Wow is he ever high on Spiller.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,7,Fri Jul 17 14:57:46 2015 UTC,And low on jordy- WR9? are you kidding me? I'll take that all day. He's wr3 after DT and Dez for me!
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,rainbowhotpocket,5,Fri Jul 17 17:43:33 2015 UTC,Not that low. Jordy's ADP is right around WR7.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"Which is insane, right? We're putting the #1 receiver in one of the best offenses in the NFL with the best QB in the league at number seven?  I don't know why people sleep on Jordy. I mean, come on, Beckham was impressive as hell, but Jordy is consistently the guy in a better offense. There's going to be a lot of Jordy ""reachers"" in the playoffs this year if he stays healthy. Every year we see bonkers lottery ticket players that this could be their year go above him, and I'm more and more convinced that's just wrong."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,troglodyte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"I have him as the #6WR in my rankings, but I would never pick him because I'm from Wisconsin so Packers players are always overpriced in my league. Rodgers is the most expensive player every year, and Crosby is a $5 kicker."

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,donnylong,2,Fri Jul 17 20:52:25 2015 UTC,So you don't waste your top picks on Julius Thomas and Jeremy Maclin.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,2,Fri Jul 17 20:56:02 2015 UTC,"Ok, but you realize the only claim I made was regarding his ADP, right? You said ""recheck your numbers"" when the only number I provided was 100% accurate."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,0,Fri Jul 17 20:58:48 2015 UTC,"He's behind brown, dez, dt, julio, aj, and Calvin for me, in that order"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Harrolddilshore,2,Fri Jul 17 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, I'm just saying Silva's ranking was not far from the ADP.  I think the knock against Jordy is that he doesn't explode very often. You'll get a lot of games where he gets a 60yd TD in the first quarter and then disappears for the rest of the game while Cobb and Lacy get the higher percentage touches.  I personally would take Julio and Calvin before Jordy because their ceilings are higher and when their shitty teams struggle they get a million targets in the second half. Jordy is on a much better team with other options.  I'm definitely with you on OBJ and Jeffery, though. My personal rankings:   Antonio Calvin Dez Julio Demaryius Jordy AJ Green Cobb   And that's where I see the biggest drop off, because I'm using my first two picks on guys who have the best chance of being a stud,  not the guys who can be the biggest stud. High upside and high risk for the sophomores OBJ and Evans. A lot of competition for Hilton and Sanders. Questionable QB situations and loss of other stud WR to draw coverage from Hopkins and Jeffery."

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Daviddem1234,3,Fri Jul 17 22:52:21 2015 UTC,The only reason he puts Jordy lower is because of his hip surgery.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,toochunky,6,Fri Jul 17 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Jordi should be a top 5 again this year, especially with Rodgers. Alton doesn't crack my top 10, but he should be a solid WR"

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Lord_Varys,2,Sat Jul 18 00:28:29 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He's clearly a tier lower.  He has a lower floor and a lower ceiling.

Rodgers spreads the ball around plus jordy is on the wrong side of 30. Plus alshon is the clear cut #1. That being said, and as a bears fan, jordy should be ranked higher than alshon. But not by much"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Harrolddilshore,2,Fri Jul 17 21:20:53 2015 UTC,"Jordy is undoubtedly the #1 receving option on the best offense. Will finish top five barring injury, and definitely higher than Jeffrey."

Even if Cruz isn't back to form he's still another target. The Eli to OBJ connection was mostly because he had no one else to trust with the ball.  Megatron was injured and was a decoy in games he 'started' last season which left a bad taste in people's mouths or they just remember.  Lions got some O-line help and if Megatron can stay on the field he's going to do a lot of work. I just can't see myself taking OBJ over Megatron."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,KoalaExpress,8,Fri Jul 17 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"The Eli to OBJ connection was mostly because he had no one else to trust with the ball.   I think the big thing was that OBJ was ALWAYS OPEN. It's the same thing with Antonio Brown. And when he wasn't, he still caught the ball. He was among the league leaders in catch % with volume taken into account."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,bkervick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think this is what people miss.  It's not just opportunity for OBJ: the talent is so obviously there too.  He gets open, jumps high when not open, goes to the ball at its peak, has great quicks, and his hands are huge!"

Marshall has shown a tendency to wear out his welcome in past locales, but did post back-to-back top-five fantasy wideout seasons in 2012-2013 before an injury-plagued 2014. A consensus top-ten fantasy receiver pick the past two years, Marshall's ADP has dipped into the middle of round five, where he is going behind Sammy Watkins, Amari Cooper, Martavis Bryant, and Kelvin Benjamin. I think Marshall has a good shot to outscore all four. Marshall's efficiency dropped off battling an ankle injury last season, and he is now 31 years old, but I'm willing to draft Marshall in the fifth round because I think he can be a target monster in the Jets' offense after working diligently to form a bond with Smith. Marshall is an undervalued WR2 with a WR1 ceiling."

Gotta take into account how other people evaluate a player. You could easily make an argument for Jordy as a top 3 WR off the board, but that doesn't mean that'd be a smart pick, because he is likely to be available for your second.  As for Julio, he was playing through injury, put up almost 1800 yards, and his TD numbers were just amazingly low for that kind of production. Had he got a couple more touchdowns, it'd be a lot more clear why he is so hyped."

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,FalseStart23,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:06:25 2015 UTC,Personally I think so. I think M. Bryant will take away AB's TDs this season with how he played the last half of the season last year. There's really no one to steal much production from Julio on Atlanta's offense.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Lord_Varys,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:43:22 2015 UTC,"I am hoping no one in my league catches on. Drafting at the end if the first and keeping Miller and Joseph Randle, I would love to draft Dez - Julio, but no way Dez comes back to me 3rd pick in second round."

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Siggy778,-1,Fri Jul 17 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Shhhh, keep the Julio hype down."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,its_fink,3,Fri Jul 17 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"Decent list overall, still think with it being July and with no appeal news that he should at least bump Leveon down a few places."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,bearsdriving,2,Fri Jul 17 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"My first thought too, even if he repeats last years crazy 18.1 ppg, he will only be RB5/RB6 for total points. Missing someone an extra 3 games is crazy and effects your draft as you have to take a Mason or DeAngelo to make up for it later instead of true values."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"Evan's logic is seemingly always that he wants the guys who are going to win titles. If Bell puts up the most points per game played, that's what matters come playoffs. Bell is a 3 down back, who catches passes, in a very exciting offense.   As you side, you can plan for that missed few games to start the year and weather the storm. Lots of us drafted AP last year and still made the playoffs. It's not as if 3 games missed means you're complete screwed, and in this case, you know in advance and can plan accordingly."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,bearsdriving,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"I agree and if he fell to me in my league I wouldn't hesitate to draft him, but I wouldn't do it #1. Although I do agree with the logic, just not mine.  If you're in a league with a small playoff, those 3 games are too important. I also drafted a bust in the 1st and made the playoffs, but when 6 teams get in it is much easier to be risky than with 4."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I'm not saying it's stupid to pass on him at #1, just making the case for why I agree that he's an option at #1.   It also highly depends on the size of your leagues and the amount of playoff spots as you said. I may also have some false confidence after getting second place (regular season) in a 14 team league league where I drafted AP in the first (and probably had him for the first 6+ weeks) and held onto Josh Gordon all season despite only a 5 man bench. (And yes, Josh Gordon also sank my team with that 1.5 in the playoffs or whatever it was)"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,avocadosandham,2,Fri Jul 17 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"even if he repeats last years crazy 18.1 ppg, he will only be RB5/RB6 for total points.    Agreed, but you need to factor in the production you will get from his spot on your roster, total, with a sub like deangelo first couple weeks. You are basically assuming you get a zero at that spot while he is out. Realistically, there are lots of good subs for the early weeks (Tre Mason, Deangelo, etc.) that you can get late. There are some people, like myself, who are more likely to want Leveon because of that supsension, because I guarantee I can replace him in my lineup for the first 3 weeks and get decent production, and then I know that Leveon will be healthy come week 4."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,government_sponsored,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:19:23 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. You can take someone like joique bell late who will likely start in the beginning of the season and maybe overtaken later by ameer abdullah
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,bearsdriving,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"Which is why I mentioned Mason because he could put up starter points for 3 weeks but you can get him in the 8th or about 20 picks later.   To each his own really, I think Joique is underrated and am surprised everytime i see his stats from last year."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,FredFlanders,0,Fri Jul 17 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"This logic is wrong.  He may be RB5/6 overall, but for the games he plays, he is expected to be ~RB1.  Give me a filler for those games he misses, and I'll take his production from Week 4 through the playoffs."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,toolroomknights,3,Fri Jul 17 16:05:54 2015 UTC,"He's not very high on Latavius Murray, RB 25 overall. He's basically saying on a week with no bye's, he wouldn't be a starter in 12-team leagues."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,bearsdriving,3,Fri Jul 17 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"There are enough question marks with Murray to justify that placement.  Besides the fact his coaches brought in two more RBs in FA, he wasn't great last year. Even when he was given RB1, RB2 carries towards the end of the year, he was producing RB19 pts. He has a lot of upside and would be a good value at RB25, but it's a hard sell to some."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,xIrish,3,Fri Jul 17 19:07:11 2015 UTC,I heard Evan on a podcast a few weeks ago and he's pretty high on Helu if I recall correctly. Believes he could very well be the RB that thrives in that offense.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:37:08 2015 UTC,Weird. Some people don't even think he will make the roster.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,xIrish,5,Fri Jul 17 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Do you have a source for this? This sounds pretty implausible. You don't bring in a guy as your change-of-pace back for $2m a year just to cut him, especially with no real replacement."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,-3,Fri Jul 17 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"No, I don't have a source for a statement that starts with ""some people think"".  His unguaranteed salary doesn't matter if they cut him.  The argument is that they have a crowded backfield with Murray, Richardson, Reece, and Helu. Reece has a lot of receptions over the past few years so Helu might be fighting for the same role."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,xIrish,3,Fri Jul 17 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"IIRC, $1m of his contract is fully guranteed. Sorry, didn't mean to come off as rude, was just curious if this was a team report that I had missed. You're definitely right about that being a crowded backfield--curious how it shakes out this year."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,0,Fri Jul 17 18:30:48 2015 UTC,"He does have $1M guaranteed, but he also has a $1M roster bonus to go along with his $1M base salary. And next year his base salary is $2M.  So cutting him is certainly an option if they don't feel that he will be a contributor."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,1zee,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:46 2015 UTC,"He'd be a flex starter assuming the the team he's on has two top-24 options.  Those top 24 guys usually aren't equally distributed, though.  I had Ray Rice, MJD, Jamaal Charles, and Peyton Hillis in 2010. Doesn't mean Peyton Hillis wasn't a quality start that year.  Murray will have value."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,tarbender2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:30 2015 UTC,"Will he score substantial TDs? Not likely IMO, considering his team. Will he be the 3rd down back? Right now it seems doubtful. Schedule should always be taken with a grain of salt, but it would be hard to start him in games Oakland looks to get floored. On the schedule this year is CIN, BAL, PIT, MIN, DET, GB wk 15, DEN wk 14, DEN again, SD X2, KC X2. So you are spending a 5th round pick for what kind of upside in a handful of games?"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,toolroomknights,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:53 2015 UTC,"There are many question marks with Murray, that is a legitmate argument but same could be said for almost every RB2.  You're crazy if you think the Raiders will get 'floored' by MIN, KC, SD, DET. I'd argue the CIN and PIT games will be close too.   The Raiders have improved on offence and defence, they aren't as bad as you think. They will come up with an absolute dud once and while and lose by 30 but they should be competitive this year. They ended the year 3-3 and almost beat Seattle last year in Seattle."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,tarbender2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed on all points. Didn't mean to suggest OAK will get floored in all of those games per se - just attempting to show the likelihood of how one could find themselves disappointed in Murray on a week to week basis. Similar to a Saints WR in this respect - total season stats might look OK, but when do you start him? I understand RB2+ are all crapshoots, still I question Murray's upside in comparison to other RBs in that range (Jennings, Gurley, Yeldon, etc)"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Cifra00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"The Raiders are bad. They can be improved and still be one of the worst teams in the league. Arguing from what we know now that it's ""crazy"" to think the Raiders will get crushed by teams that went 11-5 last year... That's crazy. Even the most optimistic Raiders fan has to realize they aren't anywhere near the level of DET, CIN, and PIT and significantly worse than all those other teams you listed."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,toolroomknights,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"I've been a Raider fan for 20 years and I'm not optimistic about these season in terms of W/L record but they will compete if they can find consistency which I think they will.  Despite poor fantasy stats, David Carr was praised by many for his job last year and should take big strides this year. They added a veteran receiver, a rookie phenom, improved their o-line, strengthened their run game and added some nice defensive pieces.  Maybe the Lions will crush them, but it's not like the Bengals blow many teams out and Oakland always plays the Steelers tough, including wins in their last 2 matchups (2012 and in 2013) when they were worse than they are now.  We got very sidetracked from the original discussion but you make it seem like the raiders are much worse than they are. Hopefully they prove you wrong."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Cifra00,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not the guy you started this with if you didn't notice - just want to make sure you don't blame him for me calling you crazy :)  I guess, I don't see Carr as anything special. I'll be honest and say at best I think he could be an Andy Dalton. Cooper will be good, but every other shitty team got a fancy new toy in the draft as well. Your free agency was very good, but it'll take more than a good free agency to make the raiders competitive in my mind.  I'm not saying all of those teams will blow you out of the water, but it could easily be any of them and it'd be more surprising than not if the Raiders put up much of a fight against more than a couple of them.  And I'm not trying to come off as a ""har had lets shit on the Raiders"" type of guy. I'm a Redskins fan. We suck too. In fact, we sucked back when you were in the Super Bowl, and we suck today. But both of us ought to be thrilled with improving to 5-11 this year."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,toolroomknights,2,Fri Jul 17 19:42:56 2015 UTC,"Ya my original response was just due to the fact the guy was implying the raiders were going to be blown out in half their games which is a ridiculous statement.  I don't see anything wrong with him being Andy Dalton, Dalton made the Pro-Bowl don't forget. I see him maybe being like Carson Palmer only time will tell. Let's up hope our teams can make the playoffs sooner rather than later, been a tough decade for the both of us."

The #2 fantasy WR in Fantasy points last year, healthy, with the best QB in the league tossing to him. Megatron. When healthy, he's just the best in the league. Are we worried about more injuries? Dez. A Julio/Demaryius level talent playing with a top-5 QB behind the best OL in the league. Yeah, he's only one point behind Julio but he seems like an easy number one. Antonio. Big Ben is playing maybe the best he ever has and Antonio has the talent to back it up.   Everyone on the list has a QB/OL combo that I trust more, and/or greater talent (the greater talent is admittedly a small group). He's never finished better than eighth in WR fantasy points. I'm not denying his upside, but his floor seems sketchy compared to some of these other guys."

And you're putting him ahead of Sammy Watkins, who played a full season, put up 2x his yards and 3x his TDs and is dealing with pretty much the same QB situation? There's just no argument for that."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,BookofEliManningFace,3,Fri Jul 17 22:09:12 2015 UTC,"The QB rankings are ridiculous. All of them are off by at least a round, if not way more.   I get the wait on QB strategy, but Wilson in the 5th, Manning in the 6th, Ryan in the 9th? Never gonna happen. Anyone following these rankings is gonna end up with Bortles as their QB1."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,thetaint,3,Sat Jul 18 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"I don't understand your logic. If you wait to be the last guy to take a QB you're looking at the 10th or 12th best QB. That's Eli, Tannehill, Bradford... No where close to guys ranked in the 20's."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,BookofEliManningFace,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"I was being somewhat facetious about Bortles, but the point was if you blindly followed these rankings and didn't deviate or reach at any point, you'd basically never be able to draft a QB because they are all ranked so much lower than the typical ADP at the position. You'd just end up with whatever is left after everyone got through what they wanted from the position, backups included."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,zigfried555,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:07 2015 UTC,Silva really shouldn't order it by rounds like he does. The best way to analyze these rankings is to compare them to an adp source you trust and use the results to determine who is overvalued and undervalued at their adp.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,benedictcumberpatch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:20 2015 UTC,Yeah by round isn't really the best way but he's basically saying those players he has ranked above them hold more value than those QBs which I'd agree with.
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,jesterx7769,7,Sat Jul 18 19:38:56 2015 UTC,"I immediately discredit anyone who still has Le'Veon at #1 overall   Knee injury, we haven't even see him practice yet Missing 3 games (if he gets less things change)   Fantasy Football playoffs usually start around week 14 (14,15,16 to avoid 17), that means you have 13 regular season games.  Le'Veon Bell is currently missing 4 of those 14 (bye week) which equates to 28%  Le'Veon Bell is missing 28% of your fantasy season and has a knee injury that we have no clue how healthy he will be.   Yet is more valuable/safer than EVERY OTHER PLAYER IN THE LEAGUE?  Not sure why people are so afraid to lower his value like we do for every other player, heck Peterson was ranked around 20 when coming back from his knee injury yet Bell is sitll #1?"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Fantasynoob2761,16,Fri Jul 17 23:37:17 2015 UTC,"I see what you are saying, but the fact that he has a bye week is irrelevant. Every fantasy player has a bye week, so relative to his peers, it doesn't matter. If he gets the suspension reduced to even 2 games, that makes him even more enticing, especially in PPR leagues. As for the knee issue, I think it's all conjecture as to the severity for right now. This is why drafts aren't until late August, so that FF players have ample time to survey the landscape. I have the number 3 overall pick in my .5 PPR league and will select him with confidence if he is there at my turn assuming there are no injury developments with him as training camp approaches."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,GravelLot,8,Sat Jul 18 05:41:32 2015 UTC,"You can't count the bye week against him. It's not a marginal cost of drafting him. Everyone has a bye week. You don't draft a player for 16 weeks- you draft them for 15 games. Of those, Bell is missing three."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,becoolimatwork,4,Fri Jul 17 16:17:25 2015 UTC,"Two totally different knee injuries, were they not?"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,4,Fri Jul 17 16:40:01 2015 UTC,Yes. Torn ACL vs hyperextension right?
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,panchojulio,4,Fri Jul 17 17:29:17 2015 UTC,"It's a hyperextended knee, unless there is something more serious than that they aren't telling us like ligament damage (and I'm going to assume that isn't the case until I see otherwise) it won't be a factor.  Next, he (and others you discredit) may be thinking he is missing less than 3 games.  Most people seem to think this.  If he misses one game, it isn't going to cripple your season, and he's still going to give you high level rb play.   Le'Veon Bell is currently missing 4 of those 14 (bye week) which equates to 28%   This is purposefully deceptive, since everyone is missing their bye week (other than traded players, but not sure how many rb1s will be trading around bye weeks), so the number is inflated.   heck Peterson was ranked around 20 when coming back from his knee injury   He tore his ACL and MCL in late December.  You're making it sound like Bell is going through anything remotely close to that."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,lookallama,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:02 2015 UTC,Well the 3 game suspension should help make sure he is fully healthy  and won't be rushed back to make the season opener. Less carries early means a heavier load later in the season.

fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,3,Fri Jul 17 18:43:51 2015 UTC,"Evan on Sanders:    Emmanuel Sanders' 2014 explosion was a textbook case of Manning ""elevating"" a skill-position player around him. Sanders entered the season as a fifth-year player who had never before hit 750 yards. He went 101-1,404-9 in his first season as a Bronco, ranking seventh in fantasy receiver scoring. While Kubiak will very likely utilize Demaryius Thomas in the high-volume wideout role Andre Johnson and to a lesser extent Steve Smith Sr. have played for Kubiak in the past, Sanders could be staring at high-volatility, Torrey Smith-like usage. At OTAs, Sanders stated his ""goal is really to try to get 1,000 yards to just help this team win ball games.” Sanders could experience a significant dip in targets, particularly those easiest to catch at the first and second levels of the defense. Sanders is unappealing at his current third-round ADP.   He's doing team write ups for every team"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Cifra00,2,Fri Jul 17 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"I like Silva but I think that's an overreaction in the sense that Kubiak has never had Manning. Sanders won't put up 1400 yards again, but has a Manning #2 ever struggled to reach 1000 yards?"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,2,Fri Jul 17 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Sanders is the one who said is goal is to get to 1,000 yards.   I think what Silva is saying is that enough has changed in this offense that he doesn't think Sanders is worth his current ADP because he's unlikely to get near last years stats."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Cifra00,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that quote by Sanders and I think he's downplaying his role and emphasizing that he's a team player and not disappointed that his stats will drop (which they almost certainly will). If people were projecting him to hit last year's stats he'd be a top 5 receiver. I guess I agree with Silva that he won't reach his production he had last year, but that's why I take him as a third round pick instead of a late first."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,IlliniXC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:55:08 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. Obviously if he was being drafted to replicate last years stats, he'd have a 2nd round ADP minimum.   I think the stats will take a sizable hit, personally. 9 TDs is a lot for a second WR, even if it is Peyton in a Kubiak offense (based on no stats, that's my gut), but he's got plenty of room to regress and still be a solid fantasy WR.   There are other players I'd rather have with lower ADPs (Hopkins, Cooks, maybe even K Benj and Andre Johnson), but I don't think Sanders in the 3rd is outrageous by any means. I just expect others view him higher than me so I don't expect to have him on any of my teams. That said, I felt the same way last year and obviously regretted it."

Do they preserve the round they were drafted in or do you take the hit on the round previous to them being drafted. Regardless, here is my team and when they were originally drafted:  12 team, standard scoring:   Dez Bryant - 2nd round Andrew Luck - 3rd round Jeremy Hill - 12th round Jordan Matthews  - 14th round"
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"I'd take Luck and Hill. Keep the first round pick,and enjoy Hill at tremendous value."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Storm_Johnson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:52:17 2015 UTC,"Hill is a no brainer.  Your second keeper is between Dez and Luck. If you get them in the same round as last year, take Dez in the 2nd. If you have to move up a round, take Luck in the 2nd. I don't think you can go wrong with either, but keeping Dez at the cost of a 1st round pick doesn't make a ton of sense to me, because you could probably get another 1st rounder of similar value without using a keep.  Matthews wouldn't be a bad value keeper by any means, but he's not the stud that your other keepers will be. Plus I do not think he finishes the year as the highest scoring WR on the Eagles (Agholor)."
fantasyfootball,3dmo4t,Lord_Varys,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:11 2015 UTC,"Dez & Luck, if you want guaranteed locked in top 5 starters, who I'm predicting finish #1 overall at their respective positions.   Not sure what you lose for keeping them, but that's who I would recommend."

Romo as a QB1 is very risky as well. TEs are ok but not great. Consider trading Ingram for a TE. Also, the DST and kicker was drafted too early. You can easily waiver wire both positions, so I suggest trying to take sleepers in the later rounds and drafting defense and kicker 14th and 15th rounds, waiver wiring by matchup week by week."

It was a reach, and there are still plenty of quality players in the fourth round that absolutely should go ahead of him. He plays in an offense with a bunch of weapons but no QB to get the ball to them. Also, when's the last time a Rex Ryan team or the Bills themselves had a good passing game? I just don't see any way he surpasses the value you gave up picking him there, and honestly there's a very slim chance he even meets it.  If this is a real team and not a mock, I would suggest dropping Cutler for a high upside RB. You don't have enough of them, and a backup QB is even more useless than normal this early in the offseason. If for whatever reason you can't play Tannehill, there will be Cutler level options on the waiver wire any given week"

fantasyfootball,3do3d4,bargman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"1) League 1 - My commissioner allowed within the first two weeks of the reg season a trade between two guys that was definitely lopsided and possibly collusion. It was: DT + Ellington to be traded for Doug Martin, Keenan Allen, and Eric Decker. I don't care what anyone says, Doug Martin is terrible, Keenan Allen was entering only year 2 of a fantastic rookie campaign - which I understand the desire, and Eric Decker got downgraded from a high-powered Broncos to the Jets. It was a terrible trade and the commissioner supposedly missed it. This allowed for the person who received DT and Ellington to go on a tear for several weeks after he was on a bad losing streak to start the season (pre-DT/Ellington). These two guys are pretty good friends and to me it seemed like possible collusion. Later, my commissioner seemed to be more 'aware' especially when trades impacted the top teams competing against him. There was just no real consistency.  2) League 2 - One of our buddies girlfriend decided to join our league for her first FF season. I may be bitching to bitch but with money on the line and with an expected level of fairness I figured he would just give her a few pointers and set her on her way. If she didn't set her line up so be it, if she didn't pay attention to waivers so be it, etc. No, he basically ran her team, which in my opinion is increasing his odds to win money because she would've given him the money for sure. There was also the ability to push threw or veto trades considering he basically had two votes at all times. It just seemed real unfair to me although many others may not see a problem with it."

There was a good post here a whole ago disproving that notion and my own experience with making VBD rankings has been that it doesn't make the top QBs more valuable than the top RBs or WRs.

fantasyfootball,3dokie,zimmeli,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:20:02 2015 UTC,I would say it inflates the studs more. I'm in a 6pt Td league and there is always a huge gap between the top three or four guys and the rest.

Rodgers is right behind.  The quality of QBs drops massively after that.  I am taking scarcity to mean how quickly VORP drops.  In 6pt passing TD league, QB drops every bit as rapidly as TE."

If Tannehill improves his deep ball and they have a more high powered offense that could open up the field a lot for miller and give him some space he may have not had previously."

Even though I don't really like him at his current ADP (until we see that he actually has the job locked up in camp/preseason) I'd say the likeliest to be able to do it is Joseph Randle. He's got the situation (great o-line, great #1 WR to keep defenses honest, very good QB) and in limited action last year he was very good. I don't know that he can handle a full-time workload at elite production, but I think he has the best chance.  Edit: Also, just to piss people off... Montee Ball."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Storm_Johnson,12,Fri Jul 17 15:07:36 2015 UTC,Alfred Morris has a shot if they give him more goal line touches. The addition of Callahan gives him a boost that no one seems to be mentioning. The same coach of Dallas' o-line last year and the jets when they were at the top of the league in team rushing yards. Alfy's yards have always been there but if he can creep towards double digit TDs he's a top 8 RB or higher.   http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/26/redskins-alfred-morris-bill-callahan-power-scheme-/  Melvin Gordon is the other one who has a shot. We're all assuming 200-220 carries but who knows what SD's plan is. They could end up feeding him 300-350 carries giving him the volume to finish top 5. Still a risky pick being that he's a rookie (many unknowns) but he's the only one I can think of that has top 5 upside.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,riotoustripod,5,Fri Jul 17 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"If RG3 returns to something resembling 2012 form, I think Morris has a very real shot at top-5 numbers in standard scoring...but that's a big if, and his value in PPR is far lower."

And Cam won't have as many goal line TDs, with more going to J-Stew, because Rivera doesn't want to risk his highly paid quarterback's health."

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,bigox99,22,Fri Jul 17 16:18:54 2015 UTC,I'd have to lean towards Frank gore. He is in the best situation of the rb after 12.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,smacksaw,16,Fri Jul 17 14:35:10 2015 UTC,"He is in the best situation    That O-line struggled to open holes all year. He's not in the best situation.  The back in the best situation is probably Crowell because of the quality of the Browns O-line coupled with their need to run the ball.  The Colts may use the pass to set up the run or they may simply use the pass because they have little defense.   I have stayed away from Frank Gore because I think he has one of the worst situations. He's an older back with a lot of miles on his body going to a team with an O-line that has historically proven they can't run the ball with a really great QB, TEs and WRs.  Basically Steven Jackson on the Atlanta Falcons. I'll let y'all be the genius on that one."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,mottsauce523,3,Fri Jul 17 17:13:02 2015 UTC,"Upvoting because this is a really interesting analysis, you don't deserve the downvotes."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,shiggidyschwag,8,Fri Jul 17 18:38:21 2015 UTC,Gore is a good pass catcher though too.  Ahmad Bradshaw lit it up for the Colts last year before he went out with an injury.  Gore should be fine.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,smacksaw,-2,Fri Jul 17 17:29:20 2015 UTC,"Gore is a fine pass catcher and Bradshaw certainly played well, but I meant what I said when I said it.  Bradshaw was 28 last year and has had 1052 career carries and is a much lighter back than Gore. Frank is 32 this year and has 2442 carries in his career.   So when I said ""I have stayed away from Frank Gore because I think he has one of the worst situations. He's an older back with a lot of miles on his body going to a team with an O-line that has historically proven they can't run the ball with a really great QB, TEs and WRs."", you responding with ""he's just like Ahmad Bradshaw"" doesn't address my point.  Bradshaw is a smaller, fleet-footed back. Gore is a thick, bowling ball. Gore has had more than twice the usage as Bradshaw and is older.  Steven Jackson was 29 and had 2400 carries when he went to Atlanta. Same as Gore, except 2 years younger.  Your comment has zero reasoning. I gave reasoning and then I provided stats. This is supposed to help people. Qualify your opinions."

Provide facts to your opinions...his situation is definitely not a problem, that offense is going to be SPECTACULAR. I don't need to provide proof as to why Andrew Luck's offense is going to put up top tier numbers this year...I do know that Gore won't get as many touches as he's used to as Indy is a Pass First, Pass Second, Pass Third team...but being that the offense will be extremely successful, you'd have to imagine that the starting RB is going to put up solid numbers. The only thing that would hold Gore back is his health because of his age...but he hasnt missed a game in FIVE YEARS! I expect 1100 yards, and 8-9 touchdowns rushing..he's also only caught over 20 receptions in 2 of the last 5 years so i only expect around 25 catches and a touchdown or two. That's good rb2 value."

You think he's gonna face that many 8 man fronts again on an offense like Indy's? Add that to more redzone opportunities plus a bigger role in the passing game to that of San Fran, I fail to see how this is not one of the best situations."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,shiggidyschwag,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:25 2015 UTC,"What I was getting at is that it didn't matter that the Colts had a poor run blocking O-line; they still produced a top fantasy back thanks to how good he was in the passing game.  I expect Gore to also put up great (for a RB) receiving numbers and still outperform what the colts RBs did last year in the running game seeing as how he's a much better runner than either Bradshaw or TRich.  If you want to avoid him due to age or workload concerns that's perfectly valid, but I disagree that his ""situation"" is a problem like you said it is."

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,NolaBrownsFan,12,Sat Jul 18 15:37:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about top 4, but keep an eye on Isaiah Crowell.  The Browns plan to run A LOT this season, and behind a healthy O-Line, Crowell should be able to get plenty of TDs.  Downside: Browns have a three-headed monster in the backfield this year with the addition of rookie Duke Johnson (another sleeper pick that should get plenty of points in a PPR league).  I know Browns players are ill-advised in most fantasy aspects, but before Alex Mack went down last year, the Browns had one of the best rushing attacks in the NFL.  And word out of Mini-Camp this year says they plan to go run-heavy this season with the lack of a solid QB."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,smacksaw,4,Fri Jul 17 15:49:48 2015 UTC,"The thing I like about Crowell is that he has the size/ability to break it at any time. He could give way to a more powerful back, but even Jamaal Charles has proven that size isn't the only factor when pounding the ball. I absolutely think Crowell could be successful with 60% of the carries, very much a Fred Jackson type of guy except with more volume and a higher top end."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,NolaBrownsFan,3,Fri Jul 17 17:19:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  He's quick but strong enough to put his head down and make a safety think twice about getting in front of him.  Plus, this play in week 12 last year (around 0:30 mark)."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,otherfuckinTerps,2,Fri Jul 17 17:26:14 2015 UTC,How do you feel about West?
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,NolaBrownsFan,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"He'll get his touches because they like to play RB by committee. Sometimes the starting RB won't even end up with the most carries at the end of the game.  But Crowell should be favored on the goal-line due to his size and ""bruiser"" type of play.  What West brought to the table last year (speed, good hands, quick cuts), Duke has impressed with during minicamp. So I think you'll see a lot of would-be West touches going to Duke Johnson.  West would be a good waiver-wire pickup to keep on your bench for safe-keeping, but I doubt he'll be start-worthy in most standard leagues, provided Crowell stays healthy all season. He'll have a couple good weeks where maybe he scores a pair of TDs, but I actually see him as RB3 in Cleveland when they solidify their roster."

Leading to them not giving him any touches for a whole game. I'm sure things are resolved now, but the amount of praise DeFillipo (OC) and Pettine have been shelling out for Duke Johnson makes me think West is on the back-burner for the guys who call the plays.

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,smacksaw,2,Fri Jul 17 21:37:51 2015 UTC,"Spiller is too inconsistent to be a bellcow RB, and I'm not talking from a fantasy perspective. When the Bills asked him to grind it out and get hard yards he could never do it. He doesn't have the skills to be a feature back.  Even if Ingram and Irving go down, Spiller will never get the starting RB job. They will bring in someone else.  There's a reason Fred Jackson never went away and it's because his skillset gave you the element of surprise in pass/run calls as he can do it all. When Spiller is in there you know they aren't going to pound the ball inside because he can't shed interior first contact.   The bread and butter of the run game is interior running and it's Spiller's worst attribute."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Orngarth,6,Fri Jul 17 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"The argument for Spiller is Sproles' 2011 season.  He had 1313 total yards and 9 TDs, which would have been roughly RB9 level fantasy points last year.  If Spiller can get close to that than he's a tremendous value right now at RB24 (though I highly doubt he'll be a top 4 back)."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,ccoch,7,Fri Jul 17 18:06:43 2015 UTC,I dunno if Top 4 is possible but if Latavius Murray gets his shot I could see it happening. That dude is a freak.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,mmmbourbon,7,Fri Jul 17 15:19:57 2015 UTC,"Mark ingram, still has an elite qb and plenty of receiving options even after losing some big pieces.  Losing cadet and Thomas reduces the mouths to feed in the back too.  Edit: brought up receiving options to say that Defenses will still have to respect the pass.  I've heard too many times that Brees is going to drop off with no graham."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,therealjz,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"Funny, I think its the other way around. I think Ingram is probably the safer choice to be a low end RB1 or a high end RB2, but if one of them is going to be top 4, I'd bet Spiller. Finally in a situation where he can be used appropriately, Spiller has real playmaking ability where Ingram is more of a ground it out kind of guy. We've seen Spiller be in the top 10 while sharing touches before and Sproles was the #5 RB in 2011. I'm very high on Spiller this year haha."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,smacksaw,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:50 2015 UTC,Ingram is worthless in the passing game. He is one-dimensional. Those guys rarely are Top 4 backs.   Any person who is removed situationally because of deficits in their game is not a Top 4 RB.

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,panchojulio,2,Fri Jul 17 14:48:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the scary thing is how many of his carries came during games Pierre Thomas was injured, something like 3 of his 4 heaviest workloads.

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,qqbronze,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:59 2015 UTC,Lamar Miller because I have him in a keeper league for an 8th round pick...  Opls
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,KoalaExpress,3,Fri Jul 17 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Gore seems like the one correct answer here. He's going to be used. Unless this is the year where his age catches up to him he just seems to have so much upside. Punish the defense hard for protecting against the pass.  Ellington is my second choice, assuming himself and Palmer can stay healthy."

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,FredFlanders,3,Fri Jul 17 21:31:25 2015 UTC,Is there some sort of recent trend that a late RB pick makes it into the top 4 every year?  Because I really don't see any of these guys having a chance to do it.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,bananapanther,3,Fri Jul 17 19:34:43 2015 UTC,No one is going to agree but Melvin Gordon could end up getting a lot of work and a lot more TDs than people think. I think the 4 games without Gates is going to give Gordon a nice bump at the start of the year.   Last year the SD running backs put up over 1100 combined yards and 6 TDs. If Gordon gets a full workload I think he can close in on 1500 total yards and 10-12 total TDs.   I admit I'm going out on a limb here. Gore is probably the most likely to do it but my gut tells me Gore is going to hit a wall this year and Indy is going to end up with a complicated backfield.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,FredFlanders,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"I like Gordon for the first half of the season, then he's going to hit the rookie wall in November."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,bananapanther,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:41:49 2015 UTC,That could happen but I always think back to 2012 when three rookies made the top 10. Gordon has a decent situation and I think the fact that he wont be a true 3 down back will actually help him push through 16 games.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Cifra00,3,Fri Jul 17 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's gotta be Gordon or Randle, with the reason being that they're drafted lower because they're unproven.  It's like my CJ Anderson argument. He's probably the most likely back to finish first overall, but he's also the most likely to finish outside the top 25 of all the RB1s. Gordon and Randle are the Andersons of the next tier."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,doctorforget,8,Fri Jul 17 20:39:13 2015 UTC,Frank Gore.  High potent offense with many goal line opportunities.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Talks_to_myself,6,Fri Jul 17 14:37:03 2015 UTC,"In order for a top four possible, in picking the boom busy Murray.  All the others mentioned are likely to stay as rb2 based on historical performances of many years.    Murray has a new coach, of, line, and better offensive weapons.  Offensive style shifting to no huddle should help in ppr as well."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,poppamatic,4,Fri Jul 17 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"better offensive weapons   I'm not sure that Bradford/Sanchez, Matthews, Agohlor, and Ertz are better than Romo, Dez, Williams, and Witten.  edit: disregard, wrong Murray."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,micro-jackass,6,Fri Jul 17 16:45:38 2015 UTC,Think he's referring to Latavius
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,poppamatic,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:39 2015 UTC,That makes sense.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Seahawks-25,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:36 2015 UTC,I'm with Stewart. He's flashed the talent before and was close to top 5 the last half of last year. He will get a ton of work too
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,adrianp07,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:10 2015 UTC,If we're doing bold predictions might as well go Latavius Murray. I'd go Gurley but I don't think he will be a workhorse early in the year.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,micro-jackass,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:52 2015 UTC,Latavius Murray. He's going to turn OAK around this year as they will lean heavily on him
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,zamboniman46,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:28 2015 UTC,Frank Gore is my best bet. CJ Spiller could finally live up to the hype too.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,HIMOM_01,2,Fri Jul 17 16:50:55 2015 UTC,"Surprised I haven't seen Carlos Hyde's name.  Even if Reggie Bush steals some touches, he still will be workhorse and more importantly the goal line back (he was getting more of the goal line touches than Gore last year).  I feel like 8-10 TD's is his baseline, assuming health.  Could I see him going crazy and getting 12,15 TDs?  I think it's possible."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,jusjerm,2,Fri Jul 17 17:06:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe I missed it, but is no one really suggesting Blount? I know we've all been murdered by belicheck in the past, but the patriots backfield has t been this clear since Maroney suited up. Blounts attitude is lousy and his ability is just ok, but he is a big dude in an offense that almost always leads at the end of games. He should get goal line scores and plenty of clock-killing yards, let alone that he is capable in the receiving game."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,ImAllAboutDatBass,4,Fri Jul 17 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with what you are saying, but I guess I do to an extent haha. You are saying to disregard the Belichick factor, but why should we do that? Just because Blount is the most accomplished RB on the roster, that means nothing to him. First of all, blount brings absolutely nothing in the receiving game, so he will be making his living on 1st and 2nd down, which already makes top 4 hard for him. Second, blount is known to do stupid things off the field. He is one locker room mistake away from Jonas Gray getting another shot. Or james white. or whoever Big Bill damn well decides lol. I think he will definitely have top 4 weeks, but that system just holds RBs back from elite RB1 status.  And i think saying ""he is capable in the receiving game"" is being generous. He is averaging 0.5 receptions per game in his career, and 3 of his 5 years in the league he has recorded single digit receptions on the season."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,jusjerm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said in the first paragraph, and am enlightened at his reception totals. Believe me, I don't plan on drafting him unless my draft gets rough at rb.   That being said, he has scored 16 td's in his last 18 games as a patriot.  I can see him going 1100/11 and just driving all of us insane"
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,ImAllAboutDatBass,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:55:49 2015 UTC,He defintely could. I feel like he will probably be a bargain at his adp regardless. I wouldn't mind having him in standard leagues for the right price! He's a red zone machine for sure
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,PaperPlaneGang,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:57 2015 UTC,"Top 4? I think the only real answer here is none of them. Who's going to do the best? My guess would be MG3. I see a lot of touches coming, and judging by what he did at Wisconsin, I think it's clear he's got potential to be a strong back in the NFL. (But of course, so did Ron Dayne and Montee Ball, so who really knows)"
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,OldSchoolMewtwo,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"I think if JStew stays healthy, he could.  He's the guy on a team that I think will be decent.   Be assumption that he stays healthy though."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,thebadfont,2,Fri Jul 17 19:58:40 2015 UTC,"Yeldon, I see the Jaguars O-Line worries becoming one of the major strengths. Marrone as the o-line coach, paired with a new easier system, and new drafted/free agent talent is going to do wonders. We haven't had a real three down back since MJD."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,CustomMadeGJ,2,Fri Jul 17 20:10:37 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this. I wouldn't bet money on any of them but their line, and offense in general, is taking baby steps and I think the offense runs through him. They want to keep the pressure off the QB and they view him as a 3 down guy"
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,harkgr12,2,Fri Jul 17 22:32:18 2015 UTC,Bills fan here. Marrone spent every moment of every practice working with the o-line. They went from average to well below average during his tenure.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,donnylong,2,Sat Jul 18 12:03:00 2015 UTC,"ready? McFadden (RUN DMC), and TJ Yeldon. Mark it down"
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,NelsonSousa,2,Fri Jul 17 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"Frank Gore could make it happen, but the RBs are the top are proven and I don't see someone outside the top 12 landing in the top 4. Unless one of the rookies (Yeldon, Gordon) really breakout and their O lines help carry the load."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Ballinandfallin,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:56 2015 UTC,Everyone is saying Gore which seems like an ok pick just because of situation. I'd say top 4 you need to pick someone on a big offense and could catapult into elite range. I'd pick melvin gordon just because of the opportunity on a fairly high scoring offense and his potential to be an elite back.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Ubitquitus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:50 2015 UTC,Gore is currently on what was the sixth highest scoring team in the league last year and he's a 3-down back facing far less stacked boxes than he's used to. He has a much greater opportunity to break the top 4 than Gordon (who will only play on 1st and 2nd down with the 17th highest scoring team in the league).
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Ballinandfallin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:04:16 2015 UTC,You're acting like that is a fact. This thread is an opinion/guessing thread and I'm giving an alternative option to the main guy people are talking about.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Ubitquitus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"You said that Gore is an ""ok"" pick and you would pick Gordon based on ""opportunity on a fairly high scoring offense and his potential to be an elite back"". I was merely pointing out that using your own logic of finding a back in a high scoring offense who will have opportunity, Gore more closely fits that mold than Gordon."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Ballinandfallin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:22:03 2015 UTC,I also said it would most likely be a guy that has elite talent. At this point I don't think gore has elite talent and could very well start to slow down dramatically.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,pausemenu,2,Sat Jul 18 00:13:58 2015 UTC,Top 4 is quite a stretch....but I'll spit out Carlos Hyde. Very talented and has been kept under the radar with Gore.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Phuket_Bucket,2,Sat Jul 18 00:09:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Probably none of them. IF i had to choose a few that had the best odds of cracking the top 10 I would go with Jennings, Gore, Randall, Morris or Ellington. Obviously these guys would have to play out of their shoes but i feel like the top 12 picks are a very good representation of the top RB talent this year."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,aimerj,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:51 2015 UTC,Mark Ingram
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,moonftball12,2,Sat Jul 18 03:29:43 2015 UTC,"Like many have already stated, Gore and Randle make the most sense, at least to me. Gore being on probably the best offensive team with the best QB of his career is certainly a good start. The easiest point to make with this is that he shouldn't face nearly as many stacked boxes as he did last season because Luck keeps defenses in check. Even at 32 years old and with a lot of mileage on his body he's still showed he's got juice left in the tank. He's definitely going to get GL work and we have no reason to believe the Colts are going to regress, especially with the addition of Andre Johnson in that offense which will help stretch the field.   I just want to say that I'm not very high on Joseph Randle in general, but if you put a pretty fast back with decent athleticism behind one of the best offensive lines I think they should be able to produce. This of course isn't a definitive notion to make, but with Dez just signing his contract, Terrance Williams returning healthy, Jason Witten still very capable, and the Cowboys' defense getting better/healthier, I really like the opportunities that Randle will get and therefore I could see him finishing as high as the number 4 back.  I think this is a difficult prediction to make, and even more so when it has to be within the ""top 4"" is very, very limiting. I would feel much better saying player X and Y will finish AT LEAST top 10, rather than top 4. But nonetheless, these are guys I think could possibly do it."

fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,ImAllAboutDatBass,3,Fri Jul 17 17:28:39 2015 UTC,"Latavius Murray. Do I think he will actually be top 4? No. But i feel very confident he will outperform his ADP and feel pretty confident in a top 10 season.  As for backing up the prediction with stats, this article posted on here yesterday does a pretty good job of that:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/3dkrmu/fantasy_spotlight_latavius_murray/"
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Folesteam_ahead,5,Fri Jul 17 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"Doug martin. Top 4 is a bit of a stretch but hear me out. He lost a bunch of weight in the offseason. The bucs will want to establish a run early and often in order to take some of the pressure off of their rookie qb. Also with mike evans, vjax on the outside with a legitimate qb threat teams are going to shade towards more conservative pass protection and dare the bucs to run the ball. I could be way off base. Also i hate the bucs. No homerism here."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Hambone721,17,Fri Jul 17 14:36:14 2015 UTC,Doug Martin has had like four good fantasy games in his career.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,therealjz,7,Fri Jul 17 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"But he also consistently scored double digit fantasy points his rookie year. Everyone talks about his 30 and 50 point games, but he was a very nice reliable back that year otherwise. It's not like he put up a bunch of duds and a couple huge games, he had a ton of 100+ yard games when he was a feature back his rookie year."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Hambone721,4,Fri Jul 17 16:12:15 2015 UTC,"If, by ""ton,"" you mean five, then yes, he had a ton of 100+ yard rushing games in his rookie season.  In 2012, he rushed for 55% of his total yards in five games. Four of his 11 touchdowns came in one game.   He was a flash in the pan for a handful of games three years ago, and was a ""reliable"" back for the other. Outside that? Nothing.  It truly boggles my mind how people believe he's a viable fantasy player.  But by all means, continue beliving it. Saves me an extra draft pick."
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,therealjz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:48 2015 UTC,He had 10 games of 100+ rushing/receiving yards. I don't know what league you play in where you don't get points for receiving yards. Also one game of 90+ combined yards. I don't think he's a value this year because he won't be a 3 down work horse.
fantasyfootball,3dmmbg,Folesteam_ahead,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:20 2015 UTC,As well as a top 4 fantasy year? Maybe an anomaly. But this question is who may get the opportunity for a ton (275-300+) of touches and perform. Last year i believe he had 0 tds. That is tough to do as a bell cow.   Edit: spelling

He lost some this offseason so we'll see, but his speed wasn't his issue as much as his decision making on when to hit a hole was just a bit too slow.  For some people losing weight brings them a quickness they don't have when heavier, see Le'Veon Bell last year after dropping weight in the offseason."

fantasyfootball,3dnb23,SanFranSeahawk,6,Sat Jul 18 16:12:14 2015 UTC,"All of these responses about customizing your league to adapt to the 8-man league size is so strange to me. I've been in an 8-man league (a VERY VERY competitive and serious 8-man league) my entire fantasy career, and not once did we customize anything outside of the norm. We had 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE, K, DEF, 6 bench spots. So totally standard roster. Auction draft. Auction waivers. Usually 4 teams or so would be really stacked, and the other 4 teams would be more or less above average to mediocre. And then in the playoffs, it would be a crapshoot. The top 4 stacked teams face off in Weeks 15, and then the top 2 in Week 16, and the guy whose team shows up the most in Week 16 would win it all. The only thing I guess I didn't like was the crapshoot nature of the playoffs. For example, last season in the championship, the final two teams were mine and my friend, Carlos. Here were out lineups: Mine - Russell Wilson, Demarco Murray, Latavius Murray, Calvin Johnson, Julio Jones, Emmanuel Sanders, Jimmy Graham. His - Cutler, CJ Anderson, Leveon Bell, Randall Cobb Mike Evans, Deandre Hopkins, Coby Fleener. I ended up winning, but with the insane tear that CJA, Leveon, and Evans had been on, I was downright terrified."
fantasyfootball,3dnb23,WrexKwonDo,7,Fri Jul 17 19:29:22 2015 UTC,"There's this stigma against 8-team leagues because after the draft the teams are so stacked with stud players that it seems easier, but the way I see it it's all relative... No, the 8-team league isn't going to go as deep so your knowledge of depth charts and WR5s isn't as crucial, but it still takes skill and strategy to put together a good team. And honestly each given week setting your lineup is tougher because you could have seven players who can score double digits but you don't know who will go off the most. I'm in a 14-team, a 12-team, and with my family I'm in an 8-team (it's very casual). The fact that the teams in the 8-team are full of star players also makes watching games more fun because most of your lineup is involved in a big way in many of them, and that's way more fun for the casual players who don't put hours of obsession into it (like I do)."
fantasyfootball,3dnb23,adrianp07,5,Sat Jul 18 03:18:47 2015 UTC,"I'd make it something like this:  2 QB Start, not flex  3 WR  2 RB  2 TE  2 W/R/T  1 K   1 DEF  6 BN  it may seem like a lot, but its only 3 extra spots from a standard lineup which puts you just above the standard rosters(league totals) in a 10 team league."
fantasyfootball,3dnb23,thedudeyousee,3,Fri Jul 17 18:41:32 2015 UTC,i'd rather drop the 2 TE and turn it to just 1 TE. The position is still super scarce in a 8 team league. Heck I would consider wiping out the TE position completely and have them only available in flex form. Other than that i think this is the right idea. Would make an 8 man league far more competitive.

Even if each team carries 3 TE's thats still only 24 players from 32 teams. I'm a fan of variety and in a 8 team you need to manufacture it somehow.

Leave the scoring whatever you normally do  We had:  1 QB  2 RB  2 WR  1 RB/WR  1 TE  1 WR/Te  1 Flex  D/ST  K  plus bench
fantasyfootball,3dnb23,Slimerbacca,2,Sat Jul 18 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"I like this a lot. It's a bigger roster, but still seems like it'll function pretty much like a traditional FF team. I altered it a bit, though for 1 QB, 3RB, 4 WR, 1 TE, 1 Flex, D/ST K and a bench that basically only allows for bye support or injury emergencies. Limited waiver pick-ups (maybe one per week), and heavily encouraged trading if you want to improve.  Sent it over to my co-commish; we'll see what we can come up with from there! Thanks!"
fantasyfootball,3dnb23,cbnyc,2,Sat Jul 18 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"My 8 team league is my favorite  Roster is this: 2qb, 3rb, 4 wr, 2 te, rb/wr flex, wr/te fex, rb/wr/te flex, 2 K, 1 dst, and only 2 bench spots  the lack of bench spots keeps it spicy because you cant just stash a bunch of players and with all the people starting every week there is some interest in each game"

The best players on the wire were about the #20QB, #50RB, #50WR, and #10TE, which is pretty comparable to our current wire. The new league is a 10-man 1QB/2RB/2WR/1TE/1FX 4 bench and on the wire is usually about the #14QB, #40RB, #50WR, and #12TE."

We do 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 TE, 1 RB/WR/TE, 1 DST, 1 K, 6 Bench with PPR scoring.     Its easier and more manageable, if you have a player injured its not like you're done for the season...easily a lot of players on the waiver wire to snag.   10 or 12 is really the sweet spot though.  I don't like 14 or more, its harder and if a star player does get injured...its really hard to comeback from it. I'd rather do an 8 team then a 14 or more team."

Vernon Davis could see a resurgence. If they figure out how to get him the ball, and he keeps his head out of his ass, he could have a stellar season.  The Bills gave Charles Clay a lot of money, I'm sure they plan on using him."
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,LamanamanumiReborn,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I mean, just some of the really good examples I didn't list.  So many scenarios where we could see at least somewhat better TE production across the board.  Jordan Cameron in Miami, Virgil Green alongside OD, Kyle Rudolph with more other weapons around him and a good young QB, hell Scott Chandler across from Gronk, Jace Amaro a year older.  Not that I wouldn't mind any of them as my TE1, but could see it working out."
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,jedediahs,0,Fri Jul 17 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"I think this year TE will have a couple ""unusual"" players that take the top spots. Besides gronk and graham, which I don't trust enough to take in their adp's, it's a toss up in whose gonna be those top guys. Many different players have the potential. Personally I like Bennet, should be now the #1 option in <10 yds to TD and will now be the number 2 option."
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,odellbeckham13,3,Sat Jul 18 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"In my eyes, Travis Kelce is just a cheaper Jimmy Graham. Ik Graham has the records and the past production, but skills wise, Kelce is as good. He doesn't quite have Grahams hands, but he has the athletism, instincts, and the size (6, 6 and 260 pounds). People worry about Kelce's usage. the chiefs threw the ball 492 times last year. Seattle threw it 454. New Oreleans threw it like 650 times last few years. I think the targets for Kelce and Graham will be similar. As a result, i'm drafting Kelce because I can get him for around 7 dollars whereas Graham costs me 30+. Plus, Kelce was used on 66% of snaps last year. If that number goes up, look for his production to increase as well"
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,gakule,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:40 2015 UTC,Martellus Bennett is solid for at least half the season if not longer - you can get him fairly late and he's pretty consistent.
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,HamiltonHounds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:23:45 2015 UTC,I usually like to take later round tight end fliers. However if Olsen starts to slip down past his ADP once I have a solid core of players I do not think I will be able to pass him up. I am aware he had a solid season last year and I think he will put up similar reception numbers at the very least.
fantasyfootball,3do9g7,CharlieFlags,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:10:39 2015 UTC,"As a late rounder, i think Tamme might be a good option. Ryan hasn't had a serviceable TE since Tony G, and i have a feeling he's going to go back to targeting the TE (which he loved to do). I'm planning on having him on my board as a top level TE2 or a usable TE1 in my 10 team league."
fantasyfootball,3docni,JSCuadros,4,Fri Jul 17 22:29:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're spending to keep him. Theoretically, you could use a high pick to get someone with a more reliable system. But really, DT is a total monster and he could be a very valuable safety blanket for whoever succeeds manning. A great wideout like him doesn't necessarily need an elite QB to produce."

I don't think Osweiler is a chump, he could very well give Thomas another few 1000+ yard seasons.  Also, it should be noted, there are some very good QB prospects coming out in the next few years, perhaps the Broncos take one of them?  People for some reason have this feeling that right after Manning DT will be playing with a Tebow-caliber QB again.  I don't see why that should be the case."
fantasyfootball,3docni,Zargyboy,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:45:39 2015 UTC,Why would you keep a first rounder? Did you really have nobody else on your roster that would cost a later pick that would provide you more value for this year?

I have found through the decades of playing and the many iterations of ""by-laws"" I have seen, that you should keep try to keep them as 'professional' as possible.  You don't need to go ""Lawyereze"" in it, but try to stay away from being funny.  You never know when something you say will inadvertently, be used against you. I was in a league where the commish made reference to ""Shenanigans will result in Tar and Feathering..."" and wouldn't you know it, he was at the center of a ""Shenanigans"" event and the league demanded, per the by laws, that we tar and feather him."

fantasyfootball,3dmj37,IronPirate,2,Sat Jul 18 14:22:10 2015 UTC,"Just a few observations.    First these are super detailed, but don't really have much content.  I don't see where you deal with disputes, accusations of collusion or tie breakers.  You can condense things like scoring structure, roster size, etc by saying it is available on the league website, or at the very least assuming you have competent league participants that know the positions they can draft. If you want people to read and know your bylaws make them concise but readable.  Secondly, it is your league but since you mentioned you 'winged' your first year I thought I would point out the having 1/3 of your entry fee going to 'league operations' seems a bit much.  Your pay out structure barely lets 1st place recoup their buy in.  You don't provide a draft board that I can see, you will have a one time fee for your trophy, what are you spending the $10 per participant on?    Finally, I'd spend a bit more time working on consequences ahead of time.  Simply stating you will deal with league issues as they arise will lead to headaches.  What happens if a team starts players on bye weeks/IR, what happens if two owners DO collude(don't assume this is just with trades), how will new rules be introduced and when will they be implemented if they are approved."

fantasyfootball,3dmj37,adrianp07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:54:16 2015 UTC,"I personally thing having both Superflex and 6pt passing TD skews the league heavily in favor of QBs. Either option alone makes QBs more of a priority, having both makes it a near necessity to have an elite QB. With such a limited amount of elite passing QBs, those who are at the end of the draft (if snake) are at a more of a disadvantage than compared to non-QB-heavy leagues."
fantasyfootball,3dmj37,PsylentStorm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"its auction dynasty.  At first I moved it up because of the PPR, but after we decided to roll with a Super Flex as well, so I'm thinking, going back to 4 -1 would be for the best."
fantasyfootball,3dmj37,adrianp07,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:49 2015 UTC,auction definitely makes it better since everyone has access to a top qb.  But /u/PsylentStorm makes a good point about it being double whammy then.  I'd go with 4 pts
fantasyfootball,3dmj37,dlnvf6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"In my league we do 4 pt for passing TDs, -2 for INTs and -2 for pick sixes.  That way throwing a pick six, is worth just as much as throwing a TD.  Also, INT is worth the same as a fumble.    If you want to really figure it out, take the top 3 QBs, WRs, and RBs and calculate their fantasy points (yds, tds, turnovers) and see how they compare to each other.  Personally, I prefer to have the balance, not only between the positions, but also between like things (turnovers, tds/pick sixes)"

fantasyfootball,3dmoos,triplehelix33,3,Fri Jul 17 14:51:23 2015 UTC,Your commish needs to step his shit up and get you guys rules for how keepers work. My first real piece of advice would be (when you finally see the rules) if they aren't in depth and cover every eventuality you can think of... You guys need to wait til next year. Poorly though out rules in a salary/keeper league will destroy your league. I ran a league for almost 20 years and our Constitution was like 15 pages or something. Can't stress this enough.  As far as how to bid and arrange values for keepers... Its going to be mostly up to you. You won't find a lot of good resources because the leagues aren't that popular and the rules on who can be kept and for how much vary widely.  In my experience... Its entirely possible to b successful without doing any kind of future planning... And its also possible to tank your team for years by doing poor future planning.  I have lots of experience with this style of league and would be happy to help. Its a great format and more people should be doing it. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions you or your league have. I love this shit and could talk about it all day.  But really... Seriously... Get your rules in order... Fast.
fantasyfootball,3dmoos,GOTaSMALL1,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:44 2015 UTC,"How many keepers, and what kind of cost is associated with the keepers?

Any sites better than the rest?
fantasyfootball,3dmoos,feyman007,2,Fri Jul 17 15:20:21 2015 UTC,I would definitely be familiar with whatever site you will be drafting on - a lot of times people who aren't as prepared base their bids solely on that.  Would be good to have a cheat sheet with an aggregate from other sites as well (http://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/auction-values/calculator.php).
fantasyfootball,3dmoos,Talks_to_myself,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:28 2015 UTC,Hit me up again after you figure out the costs of keeping a player!  If it's no up charges/tax it's the same as an auction.  But a lot of rules can go into it.  Good luck
fantasyfootball,3dmoos,Crs3050,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:33 2015 UTC,"I say have the commissioner work on rules and start the league next year. A keeper league, especially with an auction draft, can be ruined if the rules are out of whack. The league I am in had a ridiculous keeper system the year I joined. The rules were unintentionally set up so that if you had an awesome draft you were punished the following year and were unable to keep many of your draft steals. This lead to people getting angry and eventually the whole league was started over.   Also remember when you are drafting you are also drafting for the future. You want to have a solid set of rules in place so your draft isn't ruined because the rules change every year. If you're interested you can PM me and I can give you a rundown of our rules. They are relatively simple. We haven't changed them much at all in the last 5 years"

fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,Liferuiner,5,Fri Jul 17 15:28:03 2015 UTC,"Davante Adams and Donte Moncrief are the ultimate handcuff WRs.  Those offenses can support at least two fantasy WRs. If either of those players gets hurt, Adams or Moncrief would step right in and be a legit WR2 with WR1 upside. They've already shown they have the talent and can perform in their offenses. If I own Nelson, I am definitely going to grab Adams as well.  Adams has probably been the most hyped up player during GB's camp. Even if the starters don't get injured I agree he could put up WR3 numbers, although I would never feel good about starting him in that situation.  With an ADP of WR46, being drafted around the same range as Harvin and Colston... I'll take the upside of Adams without hesitation.  Cody Latimer could enter this WR handcuff realm as well, but we haven't seen him perform in the NFL yet."

fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,sexytoddlers,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Rookie receivers do not typically produce, even with last year's anomaly.   Hilton and Johnson in front, I'd take my chances with Moncreif before Dorsett, every time. I also recall reading something how Pep demands his rookies learn all three receiving positions, instead of focusing on one just to see the field."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,cripple_stx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe Moncrief has developed more over the offseason, but last season he had his shot when TY and Reggie Wayne were hurt and he didn't produce in either situation. There was a ton of hype around Moncrief on /r/fantasyfootball last season and there was a ton of let down to go with it.  I think it's a fallacy to say Team X has a great offense so if we plug in Player Y they will have a good game too.  The more likely scenario is that Team X changes their gameplan to compensate for the loss of the more talented player rather than just assuming that the less talented player can step right in.    It should be telling that the Colts saw Moncrief in his rookie season and then took a receiver in the first round when they had so many other needs, especially on defense.  Also, rather than play Moncrief opposite Hilton, they went out and signed an aging Andre Johnson.  The great thing about Moncrief is that he is costing almost nothing to draft, so if he doesn't work out as planned it really doesn't hurt you too much.  I just don't think you should specifically target him just because you took TY Hilton and assume you're somewhat covered if TY gets hurt like you would with a stud RB."

Many teams are taking the path of best player available. They could also have drafted him to give themselves some leverage against Hilton seeking a giant contract."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Moncrief didn't produce? Looked pretty good to me...   He had 2 good games out of 16 that produced over half of his yardage totals and all of his TDs. In the game Hilton sat out, Moncrief had 2 catches for 5 yards. On Oct 30 Pagano says ""I'd like to get Moncrief the ball as often as possible."" On November 3rd he has 1 catch for 2 yards. In the 8 games after that statement, Moncrief had 16 catches total for 228 yards and 2 tds (134 of those yards and 2 tds came in one game where he had 3 catches total...neither Wayne nor Hilton was hurt here)  Dorsett doesn't affect Hilton's contract unless Dorsett gets playing time and shows he can produce.  That only happens if he's ahead of Moncrief on the depth chart or plays the X or Z spots if TY or Andre go down.  If he's a rookie WR riding the bench or playing WR4, TY's representation isn't going to feel threatened at all and I'd be incredibly surprised if Indy decided it was okay for TY to walk because they've been grooming a skilled WR for a season without getting him some significant playing time.  I could be entirely wrong, and when it comes down to it we're talking about a 13+ round pick who is only really relevant if someone gets hurt and will likely be available on the waiver wire should that happen.  It's all guesswork at that point in the draft, I just suppose I would rather take a chance on a rookie WR or a WR2 on a lesser team than worry about handcuffing a WR when WR production feels far to unpredictable to bother with a handcuff."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,poppamatic,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"Drafting Dorsett does give them some leverage in Hilton conversations. It allows them to argue for a lower number, having a potential replacement already on board. They didn't just draft Dorsett to try and keep Hilton low, they drafted him in the case Hilton demands too much and they can't agree.   Teams replace proven players with unproven players all the time, constantly. Just look at the Green Bay Packers receivers in recent years."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,cripple_stx,0,Fri Jul 17 21:57:22 2015 UTC,"If Dorsett doesn't get significant playing time there is no leverage. No team says ""Go ahead and walk top 10 receiver in the league, we've got this guy with great upside but is unproven."" And no agent believes it if they do."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,poppamatic,0,Fri Jul 17 22:33:42 2015 UTC,"Lol of course they do. Otherwise no player would ever leave in free agency. Did you not read what I said? The Packers just let Greg Jennings and James Jones walk,  because they believed in Randall Cobb and now with Davante Adams.   Other teams do it as well, at most positions.  I'm not saying they drafted Dorsett just to get leverage on Hilton, because they obviously like Dorsett, but he provides them with value in the chance an agreement with Hilton can't be met.  He doesn't have to play for the Colts as a rookie to give them leverage and a potential replacement.  You can't test run every single player before sticking with them."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,cripple_stx,0,Fri Jul 17 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"There is an ocean of difference between TY Hilton and Greg Jennings or James Jones.  First, TY is young. When Jennings and Jones left they were 29 and 30 with Jennings turning 30 early in the upcoming season.  Second, neither one was the best receiver on their team, let alone a top 10 receiver in the league. Third, the reason they were able to let both Jennings and Jones walk was because Cobb had clearly established himself as a very talented receiver that could produce in the NFL.  They could plug in Adams and let Jones walk and even if Adams didn't blow anyone out of the water, they still had two outstanding receivers in Nelson and Cobb. Indy has TY Hilton, an old guy, a sophomore and a rookie. Again, if Dorsett doesn't prove himself a capable NFL receiver that can fill TY Hilton's shoes, his presence is a non-factor when it comes time to negotiate."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,poppamatic,3,Sat Jul 18 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"i had adams as a handcuff to nelson last year, and everytime nelson played a nasty corner i started adams in his place after being laughed at by all the rest of the guys in my league.   both weeks i started him in his place he put up better numbers than jordy. i agree with you. hes a solid handcuff and he has potential to be a hell of a receiver"
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,Letter10,2,Sat Jul 18 03:38:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely a guy to keep an eye on as the season progresses, I just don't know if he'll have the consistency to warrant a starting role outside of a deep format."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,dynastybest,2,Fri Jul 17 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Another packer fan with a counterargument...  This is mostly a rephrased version of two of my previous comments (one, two) on Adams, which go against much of the hype I've been seeing here.  I would actually suggest not drafting Adams (within reason). Most people seem to be excited about Adams being a second year #3 WR on a very good offense, and hope that he could break out this year into a bigger role.  Most people are also referencing a lot of the positive comments coming from Rodgers/McCarthy on Adams to help come to that conclusion.  I think the praise he has been getting from Rodgers/McCarthy lately is mostly in regard to his practice habits. Last year, you could tell that Adams just wasn't on the same page with Rodgers on a lot of plays, the most obvious examples are the countless back shoulder throws where Adams wasn't even close to seeing/expecting an incoming pass.  Rodgers very rarely has this issue with Cobb and Nelson so it's natural to blame Adams for those miscues. That is a play that has to be perfected in practice, and you will also see Rodgers nicely saying Adams had poor practice habits last year alongside his recent praises.  Adams is currently the #3 WR on the team, and I still expect him to keep that role, but the problem for him is WR has great depth with 3 other well regarded players from last two drafts (Janis, Abbrederis), including a 3rd rounder from this year (Montgomery). Unless Cobb or Nelson get hurt, Adams should only see a marginal increase in targets. If Cobb/Nelson do get hurt, I don't see all those targets going to Adams. The likely scenario is that they would be split more evenly with some of the other receivers.  Some people will rightly question whether Janis, Abbrederis, or Montgomery can take away targets from Adams.  I won't make a case for Abbrederis, but both Janis and Montgomery can open up the playbook schematically (if they reach their potential), in ways that Adams just can't.  Janis was drafted because he can be a burner, and has excellent athleticism.  Apparently he had issues learning the playbook (I assume those weren't his only issues), and adjusting to the NFL from D-II football.  If he can start taking advantage of his athleticism, this is a receiver that can be a deep threat and spread the field for the rest of the offense.  Montgomery's potential (if he's able to make a case to be involved in the offense) has also been described as being able to do things similarly to Cobb.  We've seen Cobb placed into a number of different offensive roles and formations that most players just can't do.  If Montgomery can reach his potential, McCarthy will find a way to get him on the field just because of all the different looks they can do.   Adams on the other hand isn't a burner, and isn't capable of playing multiple roles in the offense. He was drafted for his reliable hands and being an overall good football player, most commonly compared to James Jones. He was also the most pro ready of the recent WR draft picks, and proved why last year. In terms of his potential as a football player, I think he has a lower ceiling then both Janis and Montgomery, but also a much higher floor.  Now why do I recommend against drafting Adams? He is going to be drafted as a high upside #3, when in reality he has a relatively low ceiling, but also a low floor. Janis, and especially Montgomery have a ways to go to reach their potential offensively, but if they show any progress at all those targets are going to come from Adams. IMO, they have a slightly higher chance of at least getting a little bit better and getting on the field a little bit more, then Adams does of taking targets away from Jordy/Cobb."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,gimliclc,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:53 2015 UTC,"Any thoughts on Jeff Janis? I'm not privy to local reports from Green Bay, but I recently listened to a podcast (maybe rotoviz) where they speculated that Janis could surpass Adams. I didn't buy it, but I'm interested to hear what a local thinks."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,SaltyMagician,3,Fri Jul 17 16:07:51 2015 UTC,No way. The hype around Janis is hype that he will make the 53. Davante has the WR3 spot locked down.
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"He's a boom or bust sort of player.    His measurables and combine numbers are pretty much across the board better then Adam's.  I believe the only category Adams did better in was vertical jump (also has arms 1/8 inch longer), while Janis either tied or did better in everything else.  Apparently Jeff Janis struggled with the playbook last season, and I'm assuming he had other difficulties coming from a D-II program as well.  He definitely came in as a project, but because of how physically gifted he is there is  some potential.  I could see Janis ending up on either end of the spectrum, just because of how unproven he is.  He could either not make the 53 at all, or wind up eating into Adam's targets.  The one big thing that Janis offers over Adam's is the ability to be a deep threat because of his speed."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,gimliclc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"Jeff Janis is Jordy Nelson's backup. His physical profile is similar to Jordy and he is more suitable to take over as the X receiver if Jordy gets hurt.  The coaches have been talking him up, maybe they anticipate some health issues with Jordy this year."
fantasyfootball,3dmtfn,v89_cs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:25:56 2015 UTC,2 years ago James Jones was a perfectly suitable WR3/Flex play any week. I have a feeling Adams will fill into that role quite well.

It's painfully obvious when someone does it and 90% of the time the rest of the league will refuse to give anywhere near the same value you ""paid"" to draft that player based on the principle of ""fuck that guy"". A guy in one of my leagues last season tried that with Manning and Rodgers. We let him sweat it out a few weeks as he was forced to start Gerhart and Ball with Vincent Jackson as his best WR because he was demanding a Demarco murray-level player for his qb. Eventually he gave in and was forced to accept Rodgers for Bradshaw and Keenan Allen"
fantasyfootball,3dq2xl,waffuls1,4,Sat Jul 18 11:13:01 2015 UTC,"This is hilarious, I'd be so stubborn I wouldn't sell Rodgers this cheap. I'd just ride it out and maybe see if a starting QB gets injured"

fantasyfootball,3dq2xl,trolliamnot,6,Sat Jul 18 11:21:47 2015 UTC,"Here's some problems with your scenario:  -In round 3 or 4 you're not drafting an elite QB, top tier guys like Rogers and Luck are already gone but you can probably still draft a decent QB.  -No one will trade you a top tier RB or WR for a decent QB, maybe you'll get a solid RB3 or a risky RB2 with upside.    -You're very limited in terms of trade partners, any manager who is comfortable with his QB situation will not have any interest in making your team better.  -You're wasting a bench spot.  This may not matter through the first few weeks but it could make a big difference if you haven't moved this second QB when bye weeks start and you're trying to shuffle guys around."
fantasyfootball,3dq2xl,kman420,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:14:10 2015 UTC,I agree with you.   But I had an interesting choice between the consensus 3-5th best QBs. I figured if I snag two of them the drop off between the rest is considerable enough that it would give me an advantage (and flexibility) week in and week out at QB while providing me with something to dangle out there for trades.
fantasyfootball,3dq2xl,mookiemookie,2,Sat Jul 18 19:09:35 2015 UTC,Never ever ever draft with the intention of trading the guy. Everyone knows what you're doing and that means you start out at a disadvantage if you can find someone willing to engage in trade talks with you. They know you need to move that guy and they will take advantage of your weakness.

So yeah. What happened was RG3 became worthless and noone would give me shit for foles until he went out and then I was scared and alternated rivers and roeth, bc I was scared to to trade one and then lose my last. long story short it was just a dumb startegy.

fantasyfootball,3dodc1,wise_pine,3,Fri Jul 17 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"Don't completely lock yourself into a strategy, but if you are accurate in your auction price predictions you can get the exact team you want.  It's all about value.   Since this is your league's first year doing auction, I'm guessing it will be kind of a shit show. A safe strategy would be to not spend all of your cash early but also not save it for late. You need to pay for some studs, don't try to load up on all mid priced talent.   General rule of thumb: do not nominate a player you want to draft.   An exception and a good strategy is to nominate the kicker you want very early. Either someone overpays for a kicker or you get the one you want for $1."
fantasyfootball,3dodc1,new-money,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:52:26 2015 UTC,"Good advice. There are always gems at the end of the draft, so the key is to not only save some money, but roster spots. It's smart to look for those value buys but show restraint and be careful to keep an eye on how many players you have. You want to balance your players selected and budget remaining so you can mine those diamonds at the end and have the flexibily to outbid the other managers.  Auction is huge on strategy when it comes to knowing your opponents. Chess match. Definitely don't be the guy blowing your budget early, but don't be the one too cheap to land some top players either. Always be in a position of advantage, let someone else chase a run or overpay. For the first year of this league to be an auction, you need to be in the mix at the end. Surely there will be some sweet discounts."
fantasyfootball,3dodc1,Sens4Life,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:16 2015 UTC,"I finished top 3 using my money early, took Forte and Charles for about $120 or so.  Very happy with how the rest of my squad filled out behind that. Cutler, Emmanuel Sanders, Alshon Jeffrey, Cooks, Kelce.  I think RB is a little deeper this year so I may change my strategy a bit, but having two stud RB's helps out a lot.  Don't spend much on a QB, so much depth there.    Also if you do a mock draft, it is basically worthless if it is filled with computers.  Actual people can give you a good idea, but the computers do some ridiculous bids that really won't prepare you for anything."

fantasyfootball,3dodc1,leafygreenmountain,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"I've had success milking some extra money out of other owmers early in the draft by nominating players in the first few rounds that would typically be viewed as less than that rounds talent level.  For example, in the first round nominate Lamar Miller...good guy to own and his ESPN price is estimated at like $32...if nominated in the first round though, when owners are typically more ready to throw cash at guys, a bidding war can start and Miller may go for $40-45...doesn't hurt you and if you repeat the process a few times hopefully it can give you some extra breathing room with your budget for later rounds."
fantasyfootball,3dodc1,LMS_THEORY_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:14:19 2015 UTC,I'll offer other notes that other posters haven't covered. I'm spending big money on QB if I were you. Maybe even 30-40% of the budget. The middle of the auction draft is typically where people overpay compared to what was spent in the early rounds. Spend big on top tier players early so you're not paying top tier money for 3rd tier players
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,FFBot,2,Fri Jul 17 14:02:30 2015 UTC,I think I know the answer to this but: Mark Ingram or Tre Mason? 14 team league with 1/2 PPR and keeper auction draft. Each would only cost me $5 on a $200 budget. I can't keep both as we have a 2 per position limit and I'm already keeping Leveon Bell. I'm thinking Ingram will have a much bigger role compared to Mason who will have Todd Gurley potentially taking the starting job by mid season.
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,Crs3050,2,Fri Jul 17 19:04:35 2015 UTC,Yes your reasoning is sound. Don't over complicate the situation

With the players (almost) guaranteed to not be available crossed out.    Adrian Peterson  Antonio Brown  Jamaal Charles  LeVeon Bell  Eddie Lacy  Julio Jones  Dez Bryant  Marshawn Lynch  Odell Beckham Jr     Demaryius Thomas     Matt Forte     Calvin Johnson     Arian Foster     CJ Anderson     LeSean McCoy   Now, most likely Bell will be gone, but suspensions can do weird things to peoples' drafts. That would increase 6 players taken to 7. But then there is DeMarco Murray who we are also assuming to be gone... that makes 8. Which means there is only one other player on that list which you will be forced to miss out on.   So would you really be upset with that situation? I certainly wouldn't. I say roll the dice, don't keep either, you could get lucky and have Bell+Dez fall into your lap. Or Bell+Forte. In a PPR league that RB combo is fucking gold."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,qp0n,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:07:19 2015 UTC,I put a few more options in my post and changed some of the rounds for the players.  I thought I understood the keeper rules for my league haha. I agree with you though.  I'm not required to keep anyone.  I feel like I'd be foolish to not keep Gronk in the 4th. Maybe I shouldn't limit my options with my 1st 2 picks of the draft.

That's why I held on to Josh Gordon all season long last year. That worked out great...anyway thanks for the response and advice.  I think this is the way to go thanks to how you laid everything out.
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,SloppyOstrich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:50:42 2015 UTC,12-Team Standard  QB / RB RB / WR WR / TE / FLEX FLEX / K / DEF  Up to 3 escalating keepers - player costs one round higher than previously drafted.  Drafting from 8th slot.    Adrian Peterson (1) DeMarco Murray (1) LeSean McCoy (1)   I can keep one and each RB costs a 1st Round pick.   Who do you think will have the best production over the next 2-3 seasons?
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,turd_fergusons,2,Fri Jul 17 16:10:30 2015 UTC,"Wow that is so tough.  I wanna say Shady because of age and usage like was said, but that team is rough.  Maybe Demarco? If it were 1 year obviously AP.  I do not envy your decision haha.  Good luck man."

fantasyfootball,3dmivr,turd_fergusons,2,Fri Jul 17 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question.  Reason being I think AP will have best production over next 1 season.  I have to assume his age will catch up to him so it's not a sure thing that he's productive for 2-3 season.  I can see D.Murray being productive for next 2-3 seasons.  Fantasy friendly offense, with a good OL.  I can also see McCoy being productive for next 2-3 seasons but because the OL is bad and the weak QB situation, defenses will stack the box and try and stop Shady.  He might need a year or two for his team/qb to develop.  TL;DR If you're drafting from the 8th slot logic says take AP because he's going as a top 3 RB.  Edit: Formatting"
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,FFkeeper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"It seems weird to even consider a RB over Peterson (unless it was J. Charles and I'd take that in a heartbeat for long the term). You always hear ""he's a genetic freak!"" or ""the RB decline rules don't apply to Peterson""...but Father Time is still undefeated.   However, I think he has two great years left and at least one solid year left in him. By that point I don't really want anything to do with a 32-33 year old RB that costs a first round pick."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,turd_fergusons,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"Don't think that far out.  Worry about winning this season and pepper your draft with potential breakout RBs for next year and beyond.  Look for a guy who is playing out the last year of his contract and is likely to change teams, or someone who is the #2 on his team and likely to take over.  All that aside, I truly think that Peterson will have the best stats over the next 2-3 seasons out of those three guys.  Shady is going to get a ton of work this year, and that spells trouble for year 2.  Murray got more than a ton of work last year, and I really don't see him as anything more than a split with a (healthy) Mathews in Philly."

I thought I had an answer, then changed it, then changed it again... so I got nothin', except I like em all.  The greatest RBs have always remained great even into their 30s, so if forced to choose I stick with AP.  My biggest concern with AP is that I get the feeling he was heavily into using HGH and now that it is banned & they are testing for it, his freakish body will finally break down. As anyone that has reached their mid 30s can attest, 30 really is the the age when shit begins to fall apart in a hurry... by 33-34 you are down to 75% of your prime."

fantasyfootball,3dmivr,sprinkleSomeOfThis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:45 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call.  Great value for late picks. Matthews will definitely get his looks, and more of them compared to last year.  Agholor is just a younger Maclin so I don't think he will take away any of Matthews' opportunities to get the ball.  I have a feeling Ertz is going to be a lot more involved though.  Hill would be a great pick too though.  He's now the established bell cow for them, and a solid RB1 for such a late pick is hard to argue against.  If you can get Gio for the handcuff around the same round you freeze Hill, you'd be set."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,SloppyOstrich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:58 2015 UTC,Hill.  Being forced to start 2 RBs thins the talent pool very quickly.  There's a ton of serviceable WRs out there to make up for not keeping Matthews.

fantasyfootball,3dmivr,jmays16,5,Fri Jul 17 16:16:08 2015 UTC,I'm not going to talk you out of Anderson.  He's a disgusting bargain at a 15th round cost.  Keep the two RBs and you're already set for the season with guys who have top-6 potential at that position.  That's a huge advantage going into the draft.

Next year we are jumping up to 3-4 keepers. But this year we are phasing it in and are allowed two keepers. So out of these 3 who should I keep: Gronk, Megatron, or Arian Foster?   Gronk is a lock so basically, Megatron or Foster?   Edit: these would be my first two picks since all of the players above are graded as 1-2nd round picks. Leaning Gronk and Megatron"
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,purpl3_dinosaur,2,Fri Jul 17 15:14:00 2015 UTC,Since you're transitioning to Dynasty I think you have to take Gronk and Calvin. Foster has been a workhorse for years now and with his injury history I just don't see him lasting too much longer.

That sounds like a random keeper rule that could easily be manipulated to give someone an advantage. If it's to your advantage, great, but this just sounds like a situation that is going to be unfair to some people in your league."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,fytfootball,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"True, the whole idea about adding a 3rd option is to be able to keep those diamonds in the rough that you drafted or added from free agency.

fantasyfootball,3dmivr,purpl3_dinosaur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:47 2015 UTC,"Are they your first 2 picks or something different?  I'm not big on Megatron, he's getting older and last year Stafford and him weren't always on the same page. He's still Megatron though and can beat any corner not named Brent Grimes. He always has the chance to have a 3TD 150+ yard game.   like Foster after his performance last year,  also I'd say you might have to keep him if he's your 2nd round pick.  You need at least one RB in the 1st 2 rounds, in my opinion."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,SloppyOstrich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"Foster and Gronk. There will be WRs to replace not keeping Megatron. Hell, you might even re-draft him if he's there in the first non-keeper round."

Leaning towards Kelvin, due losing a later pick. I'll probably start RB/WR or WR/RB, so I guess a better question to determine who I should pick is, What position has better value in the third round, RB or WR?  Last year I went WR/QB/RB, Demaryius, Peyton, Leveon but I doubt I will go that route again. I won the league but was bailed out by my getting Lamar in Round 8, Kelvin in Round 10 and Deandre in Round 11."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,RobertELee2016,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:51 2015 UTC,Both have great value. I'd go Lamar solely on the fact that there is a much larger WR pool to find a replacement for Kelvin than vice versa.

Even though I always thought he could be good if given a chance (which is how I ended up with him to begin with), reality is that Forsett was a journeyman backup until last year. Could easily argue it was at least a bit of a flukey year that he had. And then there is the RB age difference, which gets beaten to death in fantasy circles, but for good reason. Hyde is fresh and young, Forsett older and smaller.  The other factor is that whoever I keep this season I can then keep again for a 4th round pick next season (and a 2nd the following year if they're a complete stud).

I think he's more quick than skilled, and don't think the offense going forward is going to be as open for him.  Kelce looked like the 2nd best te in football last season.  He didn't play nearly as often as the bigger named players due to inexperience and coming off an injury, but when he did he looked simply phenomenal.

I don't think any players are really more likely to break an arbitrary threshhold than others.  The 40+ yard play bonus gives some extra weight to big-play guys.

fantasyfootball,3dmivr,Hedgery,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:23 2015 UTC,I'm usually the opposite.  I seem to have a knack for drafting high upside WR's late and having them pan out more often than not.  RB is usually my weakness.
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,Imperial10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"All depends on the league I guess. My league, I feel like people just focus on TEs/QBs/DEFs too early so that's when I can capitalize and take a RB that's still available in like the ninth or tenth round that will usually pan out for me. Last year I had AP and Lynch as keepers and drafted Rice in the second or third round (technically fifth or sixth round if you include keepers), but was still able to draft Woodhead and Hill in the mid/late rounds which were great picks and gave me great RB depth (which I needed with the whole losing AP/Rice/Woodhead in a two week period)."
fantasyfootball,3dmivr,Hedgery,2,Fri Jul 17 20:47:45 2015 UTC,If you go Hill you're overspending a little in RB. Think about who's going to be actually available in WR and if you can afford not to keep Benjamin.

We can keep 5 players(2 offense; 3 defense) and anyone in the top 30 of preseason rankings we keep costs us our first round pick).  I have an offer given to me: Pick #135 in the draft and DeAndre Hopkins for Luke Kuechly.   Thoughts? He would be keeping Hopkins as his non-top30 keeper and then trading him to me.   I pick 5th in the draft and am keeping: Adrian Peterson, Keenan Allen, J.J. Watt, Luke Kuechly, and Robert Quinn.   Kuechly is the best LB in fantasy and young enough he should stay that way for quite some time. I love having him and Watt, it gives me a huge advantage(I nearly won the league last year with no QB or TE of substance once Foles went down).   Hopkins was the 14th best WR in this league last year, making him a WR1. That was with crappy QB play. The QB situation has to be at least the same there, if not decently better. Hopkins is also still incredibly young and should improve at least somewhat. He's also going into his 3rd season as a pro, which for a long time has been the prototypical breakout season for a WR.  The draft pick is okay but not fantastic. Guys picked around that choice last season were a bunch of kickers and some IDP players. It basically will just be depth, likely a DB of some sort since I'll need to use two somewhat early picks on LBs.   I hate the idea of breaking up my #1 DE/#1 LB duo, but Hopkins is an incredibly intriguing offer.   edit To give point value reference, last year Kuechly was the #1 LB with 169.5 points. DeAndre Hopkins was the #14 WR with 198 points."

I have an uncle who hadn't won the family 8-man league since joining in 1986 despite taking it very seriously.  A few years ago it was me and him in the finals and all my family was texting me that I had to beat him.  I ended up losing though.  And he ended up going back to back.
fantasyfootball,3dkzpk,gb1993,4,Fri Jul 17 13:12:31 2015 UTC,This may be a stupid question but how'd fantasy football work if you guys weren't using computers? Be able to find stats and calculate it with newspapers or magazines?
fantasyfootball,3dkzpk,randomnickname99,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yep.  We did the draft in person and my uncle tallied up the stats each week from the papers.

So does Yankee Stadium as far as I know but I have only been to the subway series and those games are too rowdy to sit and take score. They might be in the programs which are like $5(ish) grab one sometime. The nostalgia is worth it especially if you happen to buy tickets early in the season and the game turn out to be a bit of a snoozer

They make dumb moves or bullshit trades. I played in two leagues specifically; one with coworkers and one with college bros in my classes. I dominated those leagues from the onset every year, and in both leagues for 3 years I lost in the championship.

I guess I just wasn't supposed to win.  3 years ago I started Chris Johnson against the Texans instead of Bryce Brown against the Cowboys in the division-clinching game. I checked every ranking I could find, everyone had CJ2K a few spots higher even though it was against Houston. Would have crushed the playoffs on the backs off Julio and Megatron.

In 2012, I took a chance on Peyton coming off neck surgery and got a few lucky bounces (won my semifinal matchup by 0.3). If you put in the effort, you'll eventually get your title, too. It took me until the fifth year of our league to have everything go my way (with some real heartbreakers in the meantime) and bring home a championship. I'm actually rooting for my main rival this year. If anyone besides me were to win, I'd want it to be him. He puts so much into it and ""deserves"" a title at this point.

fantasyfootball,3dj58x,bryan_sensei,40,Thu Jul 16 23:29:12 2015 UTC,EVERY YEAR I steal him in like round 8 or later... I cannot believe it... while dude's around me are taking flyers in rookie or 5th string WRs there sits 35% of Cam Newton's targets (made up statistic).
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,bakerton,24,Thu Jul 16 22:04:08 2015 UTC,"Not happening this year.  He's put up three strong seasons in a row and broke that 1,000 yard barrier last year in a season where tight end production was scarce outside the top five or six guys.  You'll probably need to use a fifth or sixth round pick on him."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,RyanFuller003,14,Thu Jul 16 22:30:54 2015 UTC,Still worth it
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,thesmash,8,Thu Jul 16 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree, he's someone I really want because you play him every week and never have to worry about him, which you can't say about too many other tight ends right now."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,RyanFuller003,3,Thu Jul 16 23:00:21 2015 UTC,"Agreed, also he's no spring chicken, do there's the inevitable decline looming. Still, he's saved so many of my fantasy teams, I should buy his jesery."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,bakerton,5,Thu Jul 16 22:51:25 2015 UTC,"He's only 30, and TE seems to be a position where players remain productive into their mid-thirties (probably because losing a step speed-wise doesn't hurt them that much, and that's usually the first thing to go when a player starts getting out of their prime).  In any case I wouldn't worry about his age for another couple of years."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,RyanFuller003,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:39 2015 UTC,"I hope so, I'm a Patriots fan but he's someone I root for."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,bakerton,5,Thu Jul 16 23:05:12 2015 UTC,My league has 2 TEs and I will be very sad if I don't get him...I had him last year and the dude was rock solid for me every week
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,indabasszone,39,Thu Jul 16 19:13:10 2015 UTC,Why would anyone want to have 2 TEs? I hate how much of a crapshoot having even 1 is... Gronk should probably go #1 in this kind of format.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,meverett3,2,Thu Jul 16 19:31:54 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of taking him in the first depending on where my pick is/who's available
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,indabasszone,31,Thu Jul 16 19:34:51 2015 UTC,He can go in the first in standard. He should be #1 overall in a 2 TE league
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,LafayetteHubbard,6,Thu Jul 16 19:38:17 2015 UTC,Unless its a 2QB 2TE league then you could debate it
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,upstairs123,3,Thu Jul 16 22:25:38 2015 UTC,"Yea you definitely gotta pull the trigger on Gronk, cuz you don't wanna be stuck with the #20 TE.  Although, I wouldn't be too upset starting Eifert/ASJ if I got some solid starters at other positions."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,meverett3,2,Thu Jul 16 19:43:22 2015 UTC,G-Reg!
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,chowler,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:05 2015 UTC,I managed to get him for $1 in an auction draft last year. Easily my biggest steal of that draft.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,edubs_stl,28,Fri Jul 17 01:23:23 2015 UTC,PPR scoring- Julian Edelman
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,BrandtHasToPay100,7,Thu Jul 16 20:54:38 2015 UTC,How's Edelman in Standard?
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,TyTimothy,21,Thu Jul 16 21:54:41 2015 UTC,"Always at least around 70-80 yards, squeaks in a td every couple games. He never left my lineup, guaranteed points.  High Floor guy."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Token_White_Guy_,5,Thu Jul 16 21:57:44 2015 UTC,He's a high floor guy. Good flex play most weeks.   My league is PPR and has point for return yards and he is so solid every week.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,ChaplnGrillSgt,74,Fri Jul 17 00:01:50 2015 UTC,Fred jackson
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,snayar,25,Thu Jul 16 20:22:26 2015 UTC,Gotta think this will be the year he takes a step back..
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,slivr33,25,Fri Jul 17 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"That's the equivilant of saying CJ Spiller will have a breakout year. Every year someone says this is going to happen and every year he proves them wrong. He showed zero signs of slowing down last year and was once again our best offensive player. It's easy to jump to conclusions and assume that because he's 34 he will have a down year, despite the fact that he still has less career carries (1279) than:  Frank Gore - 2442  Adrian Peterson - 2054  Marshawn Lynch - 2033  Chris Johnson - 1897  Maurice Jones-Drew - 1847  Matt Forte - 1817  LeSean McCoy - 1461  DeAngelo Williams - 1432  Ray Rice - 1430  Arian Foster - 1391  Ronnie Brown - 1281  To put that in perspective, Frank Gore has been in the NFL for 2 more years then Jackson and has 1100 more carries then him. Yes Jackson played in NFL Europe but that doesn't compare to the wear and tear of a full NFL season.   He's been in a split back system his entire career in Buffalo. First with Mcgahee, then with Lynch, and finally Spiller. He's never been the 3 down feature back, so to assume he would be on the career path of someone like Tomlinson who was a feature back for a decade and declined after age 30 makes no sense. Barring injury Jackson will most likely contribute his usual 800 yards and 6-8 touchdowns like he always does."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,deck65,7,Fri Jul 17 02:04:03 2015 UTC,likely contribute his usual 800 yards and 6-8 touchdowns like he always does.    You don't think LeSean will soak up much of this?
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,caricamento,2,Fri Jul 17 13:36:30 2015 UTC,Yeah except for the fact that a real running back is in front of him on the depth chart now in Mccoy.   I have never said Spiller will have a breakout year because with him I'll believe it when I see it.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,slivr33,3,Fri Jul 17 02:19:30 2015 UTC,I said this the last two years. Eventually it'll happen but he keeps making me look stupid.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,HandsyPriest,3,Fri Jul 17 02:05:52 2015 UTC,I just don't know about him. With LeSean there and I might be wrong but isn't he coming back from injury? I rode the Fred Jackson train every year for the past few years but that train seems to be slowing down
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,jre19,6,Fri Jul 17 00:25:30 2015 UTC,I've drafted him the past 3 years. He's always good for at least 5 points a game  guaranteed. And that can make all the difference.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,PoonSlayingTank,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:43:05 2015 UTC,"Fuck yes, every year.  I love hearing the other guys at my draft consistently and in unison ""ooooooooooh"" when I scoop him up unexpectedly."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,haymill92,131,Fri Jul 17 02:22:14 2015 UTC,"Alfred effing morris. Dude is a solid RB2 every year but people ignore him because he isn't flashy or a ""sexy"" pick."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,humanhighlightreel,90,Thu Jul 16 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"He's gotten worse every year and was only 1000 and 8 last year and has a late third round ADP.  Which is why he isn't a boring pick. He's a sleeper! Guy was fine in a power run scheme in college, and now he is playing behind a slightly upgraded O-Line with Bill Callaghan coaching.   Not only that, Morris has always been great when playing with RG3, and I expect a humbled RG3 to stay on the field and play decent this year. If that happens, I think Morris is a top 8-10 RB. Worst case scenario he is still probably top 15 based on work alone."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,_masterofdisaster,27,Thu Jul 16 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"As a Redskins fan, he hasn't gotten worse but the players around him have.  He thrived in the read option system. Hopefully we see it again this year."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,haymill92,7,Thu Jul 16 21:45:36 2015 UTC,Great insight. I'm definitely excited about morris this year. He helped me big time two years ago. Couldn't snag him last year though :(
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,mowbox_mowmoney,4,Thu Jul 16 20:32:34 2015 UTC,He is also worse in PPR leagues so a lot of the consensus undervaluing of him could be because he gets no catches.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,bulldoozer,3,Fri Jul 17 02:21:33 2015 UTC,In a world where you cant bank on RBs being consistent Morris is a nice pick. A sneaky god RB2
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,yosemiteclimber,5,Thu Jul 16 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"Hopefully RG3 stays on the field all season, Morris has great games when the D has to respect RG3's running potential a bit more. Plus they snagged Callahan the former offensive line coach from Dallas so I think (hope!) he'll see quite a bit of work and even more goal line touches."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,humanhighlightreel,24,Thu Jul 16 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"yes, that's pretty much exactly what I said."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,yosemiteclimber,6,Thu Jul 16 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just agreeing with you about RG3 helping his stat line and just over elaborated a bit ;)"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,AwSnapz1,3,Fri Jul 17 01:19:01 2015 UTC,Speaking of RG3: Any possibility of him becoming relevant again?
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,averted,6,Thu Jul 16 21:30:12 2015 UTC,"As a redskins fan, probably not."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Texas_Cloverleaf,11,Thu Jul 16 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who owned Morris for the first time last year it's easy to understand why, he never really had a break out game and was never the guy to carry you to victory. Consistently hitting 8 or 9. When you have guys like Dez and Forsett leading you to victory he looks like an underachiever by comparison. Despite his great overall totals."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,8,Thu Jul 16 20:30:29 2015 UTC,RBs on bad teams scare me.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Bear2120,7,Thu Jul 16 20:21:10 2015 UTC,Peterson the past few years. MJD in Jacksonville in his prime. Many backs can still produce well on bad teams.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,20,Thu Jul 16 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"AP is an anomaly.  MJD is a good example. However, my fear is still warranted."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Bear2120,11,Thu Jul 16 22:31:30 2015 UTC,Damnit! I tried. Running back night light maybe?
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,21,Thu Jul 16 22:51:10 2015 UTC,If I was scared of the dark I would have drafted Gerhart.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,AniMoney,3,Thu Jul 16 23:15:37 2015 UTC,Good thing you're not then
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,ShaquilleO_feel,3,Fri Jul 17 01:34:45 2015 UTC,Steven Jackson.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,spreiners,2,Fri Jul 17 02:44:24 2015 UTC,Running backs on bad teams...who don't catch passes scare me.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,StevenSilver,5,Fri Jul 17 02:00:44 2015 UTC,"But don't you remember how good Toby Gerhart, Zac Stacy, and Bishop Sankey were last year?  Edit: I do'nt now hoiw two tipe"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,3,Fri Jul 17 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, I avoided them last year for a different reason: don't spend a high draft pick on someone who's never done it before. The only one of those guys who had any track record as a starter was Stacy, who had never done a full season and was scoring fantasy points mostly due to volume.  That's partly why I won't be picking Gurley or Latavius or Hyde this year. The only guy in this category who I'm tempted by is Melvin because he's on a good team with a good offense and he was their first round pick. But I think his ADP will be too high for the uncertainty of a rookie. In the first few rounds I go for sure things. I save the value picks for later."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,funman95,3,Fri Jul 17 04:25:57 2015 UTC,Forte last year.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,9,Fri Jul 17 03:40:12 2015 UTC,"As bad as the bears were, their offense was still a threat. Jeffery was scoring and Cutler was actually not a bad fantasy QB.  Teams who can't get it working on either side of the ball are the really scary ones. 49ers, Jags, Bucs, Titans, Raiders. I'm probably avoiding the RBs on those teams unless Hyde drops really far or if I can get Doug Martin for $1."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Canadaismyhat,3,Fri Jul 17 04:04:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the Raiders will actually be decent now.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,new-money,3,Fri Jul 17 04:28:07 2015 UTC,I'll believe it when I see it. They have a lot of potential but they also do shit like this.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Canadaismyhat,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:53 2015 UTC,"Hey that was the highlight of the season, can't blame the celebration."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,tanu24,5,Fri Jul 17 05:07:03 2015 UTC,Hes gonna be one of my two rb's all year probably and I should take him but Brandon Cooks looks sexier at that pick and i'll ait even longer for a rb.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,haymill92,3,Thu Jul 16 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about him is so many people ignore him that, depending on the league, you could easily pick him up a round later than he should be going."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Harrolddilshore,3,Thu Jul 16 19:22:46 2015 UTC,One guy in my league has a major man crush on him otherwise I'd easily snag him in the 4th round
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,humanhighlightreel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:32 2015 UTC,"Cooks is nice at that pick too though. He is really, really good at football and now the Saints' best option."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,RyanFuller003,2,Thu Jul 16 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"people ignore him because he isn't flashy or a ""sexy"" pick.    Also because he has absolutely no value as a receiver, so he's one of those guys where if the 'Skins fall behind early, he's out of the gameplan and it's Helu time.  Good news is that Helu is gone, and the other backs on Washington's roster are inexperienced.  Even their 3rd round rookie is just another strictly downhill runner that had fewer than 20 receptions in his entire collegiate career."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,ehopkey,2,Thu Jul 16 22:26:55 2015 UTC,"Morris is what he is. He's the guy that can put up consistent numbers for you, but never has huge games that can take you to that next level. And if you want to win your league, you need guys that can have big games"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Teves3D,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:14:08 2015 UTC,"I picked him up three times now.   Last season he fucked me though, not really him, but his fullback vulturing TDs ;_;"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,pentax10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I like him too, but is anyone worried about this kid they drafted eating into his touches?"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,deck65,37,Fri Jul 17 01:13:14 2015 UTC,Lamar Miller. Never had a breakout game but still managed to get me 10 points almost every week as a flex
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,FightingDucks,10,Thu Jul 16 23:08:38 2015 UTC,I took him 12th round last year. Im thinking of using my keeper on him and not having to worry about giving up a high draft pick while having a solid RB2.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,joshaimm,17,Fri Jul 17 01:34:10 2015 UTC,Don't think. Just do that. You're getting a mid RB2 where you would normally just take a flyer.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Blue45,2,Fri Jul 17 01:42:22 2015 UTC,Wow 12th is amazing. I'm paying a 7th (was drafted in the 7th) rounder to keep him in my 12 man league.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Orngarth,6,Fri Jul 17 02:32:36 2015 UTC,"Miller is way underrated, IMHO.  He had the second most ypc for a RB last year, more than Jeremy Hill (who was 3rd,) who is going in the early second round if not the late first.  And Miller isn't sharing the backfield with Gio."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,A-Little-Stitious,3,Fri Jul 17 01:40:19 2015 UTC,You would have to have 2 really good Running backs to be flexing Laman Miller... unless it was a small league.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,deck65,4,Fri Jul 17 01:52:35 2015 UTC,It was a 12 man league I just had Demcarco Murray and Alfred Morris ahead of him. I always go running back heavy in my drafts. Three feature backs in a lineup is damn near unstoppable when paired with Aaron Rodgers as my QB.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,GlitterRainbow,28,Fri Jul 17 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"Steve Smith Sr., Woodhead, Carson Palmer, and the forever ignored Fred Jackson."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,DonMegah,17,Thu Jul 16 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Grab Steve Smiff, watch him blow up first few weeks, trade him for value before that mid season decline comes."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Ferg8,23,Thu Jul 16 19:52:38 2015 UTC,"Woodhead, Carson Palmer   I bet you were happy last year."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,sploogey,78,Thu Jul 16 22:12:29 2015 UTC,None.  It's upside or bust.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Deigs,50,Thu Jul 16 19:10:37 2015 UTC,This will forever be my downfall.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,slivr33,11,Thu Jul 16 20:37:31 2015 UTC,Just keep your downfall out of the 1st 2-4 rounds and you'll be set.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Deigs,4,Fri Jul 17 00:25:37 2015 UTC,"There lies my problem.   Flashback to last season: AP #1 overall? The guy is a MONSTER! Of course! Doug Martin in the 2nd round? His rookie campaign was fantastic, why wouldn't he be able to repeat that? Ray Rice in the 4th? Well who else is Baltimore gonna hand it to?!?!? Besides players bounce back all the time! If he goes back to old Ray Rice I just got a 1st rounder in the 4th!!!  Fortunately I usually redeem myself late in the draft. Manny Sanders a round after his ADP, Matty Ice 2 rounds later, and Mike Evans as my final pick. Having to drop so many players allowed me to work the waivers really well and play a lot of matchup based weeks. Surprisingly I somehow won the championship."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,E_Street_Band,12,Fri Jul 17 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"Suffer the first half of the season sifting through potential waiting for someone to pop, then make a glorious playoff run once they do. That's me. Every year."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,coltsarethebest,2,Thu Jul 16 21:07:10 2015 UTC,Outside of the first 2-3 rounds this all the way. The point differential between the top 5 guys makes no difference it's the dudes you draft in that late rounds that break out that win championships. And let's be real that's the only reason we are here.

fantasyfootball,3dj58x,joshfey,51,Fri Jul 17 02:21:38 2015 UTC,Frank Gore or Justin Forsett in round 3-4. Andre Johnson in Round 5. Marques Colston late. Danny Woodhead late.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,HurricaneStiz,118,Thu Jul 16 18:17:04 2015 UTC,"Frank Gore had two ACL tears in college over a decade ago, and we're still drafting him in round 3 of fantasy football drafts. Unreal."

fantasyfootball,3dj58x,atheistlol,102,Thu Jul 16 19:22:23 2015 UTC,Definitely in awe.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,HurricaneStiz,18,Thu Jul 16 19:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yup. If another back had any ONE of those red flags, I'd never ever draft him. One torn ACL? NOPE. Two torn ACL? NOPE. NOPE. Been in the league over a decade? NOPE. But somehow, Gore keeps on truckin'."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Maad-Dog,29,Thu Jul 16 20:14:59 2015 UTC,Niners fan - I love him.  I hope he wrecks it with the Colts and gets his ring.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,holyplankton,8,Thu Jul 16 21:10:52 2015 UTC,That would be rather fitting for him to finally earn a ring in San Francisco. If the niners can't do it I'll be rooting for Frank.

fantasyfootball,3dj58x,joshfey,13,Thu Jul 16 18:21:13 2015 UTC,"You can get him super late, and with Graham and Stills gone, I think he'll get a ton of targets.  Sure, Spiller and Cooks will too, but for the price, I'll take my chances on Colston.  If he misses games, you don't play him - the games he plays should justify it.  Just my thoughts. Played 16 games in 2014, 15 in 2013, 16 in 2012, 14 in 2011, 15 in 2010, 16 in 2009."

fantasyfootball,3dj58x,gibbsftw,2,Thu Jul 16 21:11:17 2015 UTC,Forsett has gone #20-#25 in almost every Yahoo/FFCalc mock I have done so far (5-6).  I still think that's too damn high.
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,beatlesfanatic64,5,Thu Jul 16 21:17:13 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. The Ravens have the 3rd best line in the league and are keeping the same zone blocking scheme. Forsett nearly finished as a top 5 back last year without starting every game, there's no reason to think he won't at least do just as well this year."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,Paksauce,2,Fri Jul 17 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"Realistically, I'm picking 21 and the top RB choices left are Mark Ingram, Alfred Morris, and Frank Gore. People are reaching for RBs this year because when it comes down to the real draft, people are terrified of the cliff that comes with RBs if they draft high on WR.  BTW, out of those three RBs, any advice? ahah"
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,joshfey,5,Thu Jul 16 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"I love gore this year, that offense is going to be ridiculous.   Look at how Bradshaw and Boom Herron did there last year.  Wouldn't shock me if Gore is a top 10 RB easily.  Never been an Alf fan, and I like Ingram, but worry that CJ gets a lot of touches.   I'd rank them Gore, Ingram, Alf.   Relatively high floors for all 3, but Gore I think has the highest upside by far."
fantasyfootball,3dj58x,gibbsftw,2,Fri Jul 17 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely Gore.  The dude just don't stop.  If it was standard scoring I don't think you could go wrong with Morris either.  I'm not a fan of Ingram, or any NO RBs for that matter.  Good luck."

PPR/rostering rules can affect it too, but from what I sense Forsett is one of the last RBs to go that people are probably really wanting to have so might reach a bit.  I'd be surprised to see him go much sooner than the end of the 2nd in 12/14 mans. Though in the league I'm in some of the people's draft lists are 'who was really good last year/wrecked me out of the playoffs'. So they'll be doing all sorts of reaching."

This was created a few years ago to reward accurate QBs that are asked to do a lot. It has worked out pretty well; QBs like Peyton, Rodgers, Brees saw a bump while running QBs and slingers like Kaepernick and Wilson took a hit.  2) 14-team league. This makes QBs significantly more valuable. Simply can't understand this until you play in one. 10-team leagues make QB variance trivial... expand to require 14 starting QBs and the dropoff is huge.  3) It's a keeper league and I am getting Jamaal Charles in round 3, Forsett in round 6, OBJ in round 8, and Maclin in round 11. I have done extremely well with my keeper investments. Part of the reason I have had Rodgers so many times is I drafted him in round 9 the year he took over for Favre.... so I kept him for the next 3 years (in rds. 7,5,3).  Considering I've won this league 3 of the last 5 years, competing with 13 teams, and all three were won with Rodgers, I'll take any criticism with my trophies."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,LoudSweaters,141,Thu Jul 16 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"I follow news on every team cause i'm a fantasy writer. I watch tape a lot too. Here's what i've got to help you.  Giants: Jennings is primed to be the main guy but the Giants keep talking about Vereen doing more than just being a pass catcher. Jennings has a higher TD potential but Vereen should have a solid floor considering the Giants move to no-huddle and his fit in a west-coast passing scheme. Jennings should be the main guy on the ground though, Williams is a plodding mess- but it's still very unlikely that Jennings scores often and the injury history is not very good for him. Super deep name that can come out and surprise is Orleans Darkwa, but not early on. I feel safer drafting Vereen than Jennings.  Lions - Bell's missed all of OTAs and Abdullah's been the first team guy. He's already the best back on the roster and as long as he doesn't fumble in the first four weeks the chance of him losing the main ball-carrying role is very low. Bell still projects to be the goal-line guy but Abduallh could eventually take that away from him too. Abdullah's also expected to be the main pass catcher, with Riddick being used more as a slot receiver. *Clarifying here that this team is likely to use a 60/30/10 split and i'm of the opinion that Abdullah is the 60.  Rams - Once gurley is healthy, he's starting. There's nothing else about it.  49ers - No reports say that there's a battle going on, just Bush being the pass catching back while Hyde runs. For what it's worth, i thought Hyde had a huge habit of improvising for no reason in college and that could hurt the coaches opinion of him.  Browns - Crowell is currently the projected 2 down back while Johnson takes 3rd down. Johnson has been used as a slot receiver as well. Crowell's still in my opinion the best talent there on the ground, but he has attitude issues that have rubbed a lot of coaches the wrong way.*(This might not be true, I thought this was Crowell and West's issue but it might have just been West). Johnson has the better floor since he could run as a 3-down back if asked to, but unless Crowell loses the job himself, he's too talented to have it taken from him.  Cowboys - Mcfadden doesn't fit a zone scheme. Recent reports has him entering camp as #2.  Jets - Ivory is the main back. Ridley might be starting on PUP. That would make Stacy the backup. I just watched STacy's 2013, i doubt he's used as anything more than short-yardage and some outside runs (he's surprisingly bursty on outside runs). Powell is the pass-blocking/pass catcher.  Titans - No actual news here, but Cobb's a better inside runner than Sankey. Cobb should eventually supplant Sankey as the 2-down back while Sankey takes 3rd downs since Cobb is an okay catcher and horrid pass blocker.  Falcons - Expect a 60/40 split in favor of Freeman. Freeman's run with first team all of OTAs and projects as a better fit in Shanahan's zone scheme but Coleman is too big and talented to just be put away on a redshirt year. If Shanahan mixes up some power/gap plays into the playbook, Coleman becomes a huge value. Still, Freeman's the pass catching back and the guy who's more likely to take the main load.  Buccaneers - Martin's had a great camp apparently. I never thought Sims was special as anything other than a receiver. I'd only take Martin if i got him cheap because i'm not willing to risk anything before i see him in preseason.  Jaguars - Yeldon is the main back. Yeldon is crazy talented but he's more of a 2-down back right now than a 3-down. Eventually, he'll be the 3-down but i doubt it starts at the beginning of the year. Denard should be the outside runner + pass catcher since he's very very, very, very, good in space. Gerhart has almost no value here outside of vulturing, but Yeldon's big and fast and has too good vision to expect to be vultured.  Hope that helps."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,21,Thu Jul 16 20:47:19 2015 UTC,"Lions - Bell's missed all of OTAs and Abdullah's been the first team guy. He's already the best back on the roster and as long as he doesn't fumble in the first four weeks the chance of him losing the main ball-carrying role is very low. Bell still projects to be the goal-line guy but Abduallh could eventually take that away from him too. Abdullah's also expected to be the main pass catcher, with Riddick being used more as a slot receiver.   I don't agree with most of this.  Bell isn't going to be the only guy getting carries, but he will more than likely be the guy getting the majority of the carries, especially on first downs and short yardage situations.  Yeah he's missed OTAs but that's because he's recovering from surgery, and not the kind that should result in him missing time when it matters.  Abdullah will be a change of pace back to start things out while Riddick continues to play the role he's always played, which is that of the two minute drill guy.  There's no indication that Riddick will be used as a slot receiver.  Meanwhile, Bell broke into the NFL as a hurry-up, pass-catching type of running back, and he remains very good in that capacity.  He's good at blitz pickup and does solid work on screens.  Abdullah is no doubt the most explosive back on the roster, as well as the most agile, but he might actually be the third-best receiving back on the roster.  It's entirely possible that Abdullah will eventually earn more of the workload than Joique does, but that is far from a foregone conclusion.  In all likelihood what you're looking at is a timeshare situation with the potential for a full-out platoon if Riddick figures out how to run between the tackles."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,RyanFuller003,6,Fri Jul 17 00:22:54 2015 UTC,"From the beat writers i follow on twitter, they were saying that Riddick was seeing snaps in the slot. So yes, there were indications that he was going to be used as a slot receiver- and that's one point where his and Abdullah's skillset don't cross. it also makes more sense with the skills he has for him to be running routes. *(i'm about 90% certain this is what i've read).  I don't see Abdullah as the third best receiving back, from what i've seen out of Joique and Abdullah, Abdullah's better and his skillset gives more reason to put him in space with the ball over Joique. Riddick's definitely the best in this group though, but he has no reason to be in the backfield since he's not a strong inside runner.  Riddick learning to run between the tackles is incredibly hard to imagine, that's not a trait that's easily learned and it's not something that's even worth projecting. You're right that it will be a timeshare, and early in the season I'd expect a 60/30/10 split between Abdullah/Bell/Riddick because of how much better Abdullah is than the other two at being a versatile piece of the offense and providing potentially high quality play. Abdullah's already a ""nfl caliber"" pass blocker (as in, he's just good enough to do it) and as i put above, Abdullah makes more sense to catch out of the backfield over Joique because of what he's able to do in space and more sense than Riddick because he provides a dual threat out of the backfield that Riddick doesn't. The Lions have not shown any reason for me to believe that they're committed to keeping Joique in as the starter regardless, even without competition last year he only saw over 15 carries 5 times and they were a defense heavy team.  I can't exactly say that by the end of the year Abdullah will have taken over completely but the reality is that there is no reason why he shouldn't. He's a much better talent than both of the players ahead of him and outside of a collegiate fumbling issue, there's not enough reason to keep him off the field- schematically or production-wise."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"Fair on Riddick--he was a receiver in college until his senior season, so it stands to reason they might try him there--but he hasn't been used there in the previous two seasons, just as a receiver out of the backfield.  So ""no indication"" is unfair on my part and I will concede that point to you.  But like I said, Joique has been an excellent backfield receiver for us, and so has Riddick.  Abdullah wasn't used that extensively as a receiver in college, averaging about 2-3 receptions per game.  Joique has 139 receptions over the last three seasons.  Abdullah can make you miss with his quick hips and cuts better than Joique can, but with blockers in front of him, Bell has the ability to throw a good stiff-arm or just bowl over one guy.  I'm with you on Riddick probably never becoming a real threat as a runner.  But Joique has been a very good player the last two seasons.  Abdullah was drafted fairly early for a reason and it's because Detroit's run game was pathetic last year (largely due to an ineffective line and only one actual effective runner, that being Bell).  I think he was drafted moreso as a complement as opposed to a guy that's going to come up and take 70%+ of the carries.  There are plenty of reasons why he shouldn't; he's undersized, fumbled a lot in college, wasn't an especially prolific receiver, and isn't actually very fast (4.55 40).  Bell isn't fast either--in fact he's categorically slow--but he does basically everything else pretty well."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,RyanFuller003,4,Fri Jul 17 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"he's undersized   This wasn't a problem for Ray Rice or MJD when they were playing well. He's built pretty similar to Rice, just a little heavier.   fumbled a lot in college   This is blown WAY out of proportion. He got better every year and I'm pretty sure ended up with a better fumble rate than Gurley (or maybe Gordon?) in his senior year.    Year Touches Fumbles Touch/Fumble Touch/Lost    2011 84 6 14.0 28.0   2012 283 8 35.4 47.2   2013 311 5 62.2 62.2   2014 300 4 75.0 150.0     wasn't an especially prolific receiver   He may not have been used much as a receiver, however every report has said that the coaches are very impressed with his receiving skills and that he's way better than they expected.   and isn't actually very fast (4.55 40)   I think 40 yard numbers are one of the stupidest metrics to use. How often does a RB actually have a chance to run 40 yards? Not very often. Abdullah is very fast in terms of acceleration and changing direction.  I see Abdullah being the main back with Bell being a third down back and short yardage back. Although Bell actually wasn't even particularly good in short yardage situations either. He only converted something like 1 of 8 goal line carries for a TD, if I remember correctly.."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,Goaliedude3919,4,Fri Jul 17 15:40:59 2015 UTC,"Abdullah's long speed isn't significant, but it's his burst that makes him so dangerous and effective. He's got the best 0-to max in the class, takes the least amount of steps to get there. I think the teams intention was to get their future back and while it's true that Abdullah might not become the main man this year, I just don't see any significant reason why this coaching staff would keep him off the field. He's undersized in a sense but so is Jamaal Charles, the main thing is that he doesn't play undersized. He makes contact well, churns legs after a hit, runs through arm tackles, breaks tackle through leverage and regains balance, all stuff you'd expect out of a bigger back. He doesn't have the gaudy receiving stats in college, but nothing from his college games showed that he shouldn't have been used more as a receiver. Gordon's been given the benefit of the doubt in that specific regard by many analysts despite only having 21 receptions in 3 years.  The staff isn't connected to Bell or Riddick since they didn't draft or recruit either, and Abdullah has some (not many) similarities to a previous back drafted under Caldwell's watch, Donald Brown- although Abdullah's a significantly better talent. Everything screams to me that they're planning to change the guard, but yes i'm not going to say it's a certainty that Abdullah steals everything by the end of the year from Bell- but he will be given the opportunity to."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,5,Fri Jul 17 02:33:06 2015 UTC,"""I just don't see any significant reason why this coaching staff would keep him off the field.""

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,phatey,2,Fri Jul 17 11:45:08 2015 UTC,"""a good job"" is subjective. Many coaches prefer players who allow scheme versatility, which is something Abdullah provides more of than Bell. Like i said, Bell isn't even connected to the coaching staff of now"
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:43:48 2015 UTC,"Well, Bell is 28 and will be 29 before training camp starts, it's no secret he's not the back of the future.  But he is the back of the present for the most part.  That certainly won't keep Abdullah off the field, though, you are right on that.   The staff isn't connected to Bell or Riddick since they didn't draft or recruit either   Riddick yeah, sure, he's somewhat of a throwaway piece that certainly has his uses, but no one would question it if he weren't involved.  Bell, on the other hand . . . despite not being drafted, he was the go-to guy last year (even when Bush was healthy) and has taken on a leadership role for the team.  Martin Mayhew picked him up off waivers and saw him grow into a solid role, and awarded him a fairly good contract.  The coaching staff doesn't make the drafting or signing decisions, but Bell did just have his highest-use season under Jim Caldwell and OC Joe Lombardi, so it's not unreasonable to think they'll use him plenty in the upcoming season.  I could be crazy to some extent.  I'm a big Joique fan and I think he's somewhat underrated.  But even if he isn't the lead back, you have to remember that in 2013 he was a backup and still produced almost 1,200 yards of offense to go with 8 TDs, making him the #17 scoring RB in fantasy.  Reggie Bush finished that year with about 1,500 yards from scrimmage and 6 TDs as our lead back.  I'm not going to complain if Abdullah tops that, but I'm a little hard-pressed to believe he will when we have an effective veteran starter in place already."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,RyanFuller003,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:50:44 2015 UTC,I don't care what a beat writer says claiming that Abdullah will get a majority of the work assuming Bell is healthy isn't reasonable.
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,machinegunke11y,5,Fri Jul 17 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"Explain why not, i explained why it is."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,3,Fri Jul 17 16:44:21 2015 UTC,"It all hinges on Jouque's physical condition when he returns.  Lower body can be difficult to build back up if he hasn't been able to work it out, but who knows what his rehab is like.  If he comes back close to 100% he is getting the bulk of the work.  He was very effective last year."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,Lord_Varys,10,Fri Jul 17 01:01:40 2015 UTC,"He was very effective last year.   Yeah, he finished the #14 back last year in standard with a terrible offensive line, but also no competition due to Reggie Bush being hurt all season long.  But he also finished 17th in 2013 despite being the backup.  I think he's probably headed for a mid-tier RB2 kind of season this time around, with Abdullah being more of a flex option.  Goes without saying that both are high-risk, though . . . Abdullah probably has the higher ceiling, with Joique having the higher floor."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,RyanFuller003,2,Fri Jul 17 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"This.  I think everyone's pissing contest between the two in this thread is totally useless. Fact of the matter is, Joique is high floor/low ceiling. Abdullah is low floor/high ceiling. That's it. Joique is set to have 900-1300 total yards. Abdullah could have anywhere between 700-1700 yards of offense."

Either way, Gordon's value is going to be heavily tied to the quality of his offensive line though, i don't see him playing well early on in his career without solid blocking and that doesn't include any kind of analysis based off of the myth that Wisconsin's line did work for him. Gordon's just a very gap oriented running back who bets on his athleticism a lot more often than I like.  missed your question about Williams. Williams still has some motor in him, but once Bell is back there's little chance Williams sees the field. The Steelers have a good O-line though, so while Williams is starting he'll be pretty good."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,DarkestTimelineJeff,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"All i have to say about this is that there has been nothing good that's ever come out of a running back missing preseason. Last year Ball missed all of his because of the appendectomy. I haven't ever watched film of Ball so as far as his fit in Kubiaks scheme goes, i don't know. But until preseason the job is without any doubt Andersons."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"Browns - Crowell is currently the projected 2 down back while Johnson takes 3rd down. Johnson has been used as a slot receiver as well. Crowell's still in my opinion the best talent there on the ground, but he has attitude issues that have rubbed a lot of coaches the wrong way. Johnson has the better floor since he could run as a 3-down back if asked to, but unless Crowell loses the job himself, he's too talented to have it taken from him.   Avid Browns fan here- I haven't read one thing bad about Crowell's attitude. Last season West was the RB with attitude problems."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,phesto604,3,Fri Jul 17 08:02:49 2015 UTC,"Draft slot arguments aren't strong, the NFL has shown time and time again that the best talent wins out. It took Patterson less than two full seasons to lose his job and he was a first round pick. However, Cobb's not talented enough to outright take the job from Sankey, but Sankey was never a decisive enough back and was always slow to process what he saw in front of him. Those traits are exactly why he struggled to make an impact in his rookie year and didn't see the time he should have on a team that started Shonn Greene over him, and why he will likely continue to struggle. They're incredibly difficult traits to develop. Cobbs not exciting but he's a very good inside runner who maximizes his limitations.  The only real case against Cobb is Whisenhunt's history playing rookies."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:10:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.

Great write up by the way, I enjoyed it quite a bit."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,phesto604,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:19:06 2015 UTC,"Cobb's a bit of a plodder, yeah. But he has just enough burst/vision to be an effective plodder. I see him best as part of a duo."

He is tough and physical enough to carry the load and even contribute as a spot starter. --Mark Dulgerian   From the first line of Cobbs draft profile. Sounds like Cobb's a better fit for the system than Sankey, cause Sankey's definitely not a downhill runner."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:47:16 2015 UTC,"Excellent writeup.    I follow the falcons pretty closely and your synopsis is mostly spot on.  The fans are split on who they want running and we haven't gotten much info from the coaches, outside of Freeman is the early favorite.  I think it'll boil down to who can find the hole in the ZBS and attack accordingly.  Each RB presents a somewhat unique set of skills and there's not enough information available to make an educated guess, just yet.    I'm not touching either until camp reports start to trickle down.  Between injuries and position battles in camp, I always try to avoid drafting before August 20, or so.  Just a personal preference."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,zjrk,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"Being that the other two guys told me that i was wrong about Crowell's attitude issues, Crowell is the guy i'm going with. Jennings injury history, Williams goal-line use, and Vereen's passing game use makes Jennings a limited ceiling player who's just a value pick for a team with a weak RB group. Crowell's playing behind one of the best O-lines in the league on a team that's going to be very run-centric, although the scoring potential isn't very high. Maybe they pull out Johnny Manziel and run a read-option offense, in which case Crowell's stock goes crazy high."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,Panda412,7,Thu Jul 16 21:59:52 2015 UTC,"Don't have that kind of inside knowledge. No reports say anything negative about Jameis and that's not surprising, he's an NFL-caliber QB on tape. If you're asking cause you're thinking about drafting him as a starter, i put up this post recently regarding rookie QB production with TE's, but there's a chart in there showing all the rookie QB seasons (for QBs that started week 1) in the last 15 years. Simply put, the fantasy output isn't high.  *To say that Bucs rookie quarterback Jameis Winston is making a favorable impression on Tampa Bay’s veterans would be an understatement. Winston has been as good as advertised on the field with some amazing throws that demonstrate his uncanny anticipation and accuracy.  Found that quote from a reporter in TB. No surprise from that, all sounds like vintage College Winston.  Also, one more note, Winston is in a unique situation from the QBs in the list i provide in that link because no one else played on a team with nearly as many weapons at their disposal as Winston has this year. So although historically, the production hasn't been high, a receiving group of Vjax/Evans/ASJ/Martin/Sims/Kenny Bell is better than every other group there."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,-2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:02 2015 UTC,"Cowboys - Mcfadden doesn't fit a zone scheme. Recent reports has him entering camp as #2.   Not claiming to be an expert or anything remotely close, but everything I've heard about McFadden was that he should be in a zone scheme.  What makes him unfit for one?"
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,the_gv3,6,Fri Jul 17 01:54:12 2015 UTC,"the Zone scheme was what gave him his most unproductive years in Oakland, McFadden doesn't have the patience or the foresight to be a runner who allows blocks to develop and can see blocks developing ahead of other blocks. He's a pure physical talent who just needs a lane to run through.  For what it's worth, because i should have expanded, the Dallas OL is so god damn good that there's a chance that he still thrives there but at that point you're pretty much coinflipping as to whether McFadden's holes in his game are covered by how good the run blocking is or if his holes make him falter again. Or of course, the Cowboys could decide to switch to a power/gap scheme for McFadden but that's a highly unlikely scenario."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,-3,Fri Jul 17 01:57:38 2015 UTC,What years did they run the zone scheme?  Listening to a lot of podcasts with fairly reputable analysts they would often talk about the Raiders and how McFadden should be in a zone scheme and how his running style wasn't good for a man blocking scheme.
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,the_gv3,2,Fri Jul 17 02:17:35 2015 UTC,I remember doing some research in previous years about RBs switching from power running to zone schemes. McFadden was the prime suspect of falling off the face of the earth when switching to zone schemes.
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,4thAndaDick,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"Dennis Allen's entire tenure was Zone Scheme. Which podcast/what analysts? Curious if they're any of the guys i follow too.  Also, scouting is an inexact science. It's a very subjective and opinion based hobby/career (the NFL's drafting record shows this). There's a good amount of film analysts i follow as well who are against McFadden's placement, so like, yeah, it's not crazy that there's going to be disagreement."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"I can't remember specifically who said it, but I listen to the ESPN Football Today podcast a lot and I believe it was either Matt Williamson, or a guest on that podcast.  Totally understand the inexact science of scouting.  I worked in baseball for a couple years and there's a flipside to everything.  I really am interested in learning more about man vs. zone blocking schemes and how different running styles/players do in them so I'm more curious about that more so than McFadden specifically."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,the_gv3,3,Fri Jul 17 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"If you do some googling about inside zone/outside zone you'l see what kind of things they look for. There's some good articles on jimlightfootball about the schemes, although they don't go specifically into the act of scouting for them you'll understand what's expected.  The simple answer is patience, decision making, and burst makes you fit into a zone scheme and being athletically gifted makes you an automatic fit into a gap/power/man scheme. Gurley is a player who fits into both for example."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,NannigarCire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:35:07 2015 UTC,I have done some research and get the basics.  I think my next step is transitioning to the viewing aspect and being able to decipher what exactly the RBs are doing in relation to each scheme and how their abilities both physically and mentally help/hurt them.  In addition to just continuing my education about each scheme.  I would like to be able to watch a game and more easily pick out which scheme a team is using.
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,the_gv3,3,Fri Jul 17 02:44:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, practice makes perfect. I started doing this a year ago and i had a really basic understanding that made me miss hugely on Jeremy Hill because i saw him as a straight line runner with low vision. Turns out he's perfect for Power/gap. Also, i'm rewatching McFadden's 2010 right now (his most productive year) just to make sure i'm not crazy about the Gap/Power vs Zone part of his game. So far all the runs have been Gap/Power."

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,tanu24,3,Thu Jul 16 19:21:20 2015 UTC,"are u not worried that even when Gurley comes back he wont be 100% and will be paired heavily with Mason? Plus, that division can be scary (seahawks run D, cardinals run D). I really like both Gordon and Gurley and i'm definatley taking Gordon (i really like his skillset and i think he's in for a great season in a good offense) but idk if i can pull the trigger on gurley. give me your reasoning?"
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,odellbeckham13,3,Thu Jul 16 20:02:58 2015 UTC,In the 12 games Tre Mason played he played averaged 4.3 YPC on 179 carries.   He averaged 3.7 YPC on 129 carries against the following defenses in that stretch:    2 games against Seattle (3rd best rushing defense)  2 games against San Fran(7th)  2 games against Arizona (13th)  Denver (2nd) Redskins (12th)   He averaged 5.7 YPC on 50 carries against the other 4 teams. All of those teams were ranked 22nd or below in terms of rush defense.   His current ADP on espn is #95 Overall putting him in the 8th round in a 12 team league. Gurley is currently at #50 Overall. I do not think think Gurley will be healthy/Know the offense/Be able to pass block well enough to start the season. That is purely speculation. But give me Mason exactly 3 rounds later.   Other Related info: The rams were the 20th best rushing team last year but averaged 4.1 YPC on 395 attempts. They lost 2 veteran offensive linemen in Jake Long and Scott Wells and the football guys rank them as the worst offensive line going into this season. They did draft four O linemen this past spring.
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,machinegunke11y,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way about Gurley. Obviously a huge talent but I just wonder how long it'll take him to fully get going. It's not just getting healthy but also getting acclimated to the offense and general speed of the NFL.   Could also see Mason playing well and them being cautious/slow to get him involved, and then you've spent a 4th or 5th round pick on an injured player coming into a messy time share.   Personally I'm avoiding, but will keep an eye out for a trade opportunity once the season kicks off."

Think Ingram/Sproles a few seasons ago in NO Browns: Crowell is the guy until stated otherwise Cowboys: more of a wait and see, but Randle looks like the guy right now Jets: pick your poison and die with it Titans: Sankey has done nothing to earn the starting job, so I'd rather have Cobb, but neither is very appealing right now Falcons: Freeman should maintain his grip on the starting role, at least to start the season Bucs: see Jets Jaguars: see Bucs"

You could grab sims/Martin both super late or Cobb/sankey now to lock up a teams rbs before one rises. Same with the rookies.

fantasyfootball,3djc1c,zjrk,2,Fri Jul 17 06:06:53 2015 UTC,"You could, but at this point, its all hype. If he busts then you're out a 4th pick."
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,juicyja,2,Fri Jul 17 10:58:59 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll put it this way. By the time it's coming back on the board to me, there is Yeldon, Gurley, Blount, and possibly Ellington. I'd probably take Ellington over Randle, but wouldn't you want Randle over the others at that point?"
fantasyfootball,3djc1c,zjrk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"I would.  I just did actually.  Took him over CJ Spiller, Joique, Blount, Gio, Gurley etc.    I think he wins the position.  Even if he's not the clear workhorse back he will get enough work to put up solid numbers and I really feel like he has the possibility to end up a top 14 rb if he keeps his off field issues under control.  I think his adp will keep getting higher as the preseason goes on, and the 4th round is good value for him in a 14 team league."

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,GATTACABear,2,Fri Jul 17 14:19:20 2015 UTC,since I drafted him in the 20th round last year i get to keep him as an 18th pick this year. I'm thrilled.

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,mcmuffin10,2,Fri Jul 17 03:55:15 2015 UTC,"Miller Probably won't even be drafted in most leagues, but I can see him being a top waiver pick up in the first 3 weeks"
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Harrolddilshore,8,Fri Jul 17 22:26:41 2015 UTC,"Ertz is going way before Julius Thinas Antonio Gates and Jason Witten so I'm not sure what you're getting at.  My pick is Eifert. He had 6 fantasy points by the 4th drive of the season and was injured. He's big and athletic and is currently going as TE 24 aka undrafted. You can snag him in the last round and bump up a round to get a better DST. Money  If not him, Rudolph"
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Aceoangels,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:41:10 2015 UTC,Eifert was my Gronk insurance last year; was bummed with his injury.  With Greshem gone he should have 60-70 catches for 800 yards.  He could flirt with 8-10 TD's if he's healthy.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,aksoileau,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"I've definitely seen him last until the last three rounds in a 10-man.  But what I want is to have about 5 of these guys that I would be comfortable taking, so I can wait until round 13 and grab whoever is left.  I'm not sure I like Ertz better than a lot of the other guys mentioned anyway.    I like all the Eifert love.  I had not thought about him, and he seems like he'll be widely available."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,LawsBound,8,Fri Jul 17 18:54:22 2015 UTC,Dwayne Allen and Tyler Eifert
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Matthouse3,4,Fri Jul 17 04:22:17 2015 UTC,I think Eifert could have a very sneaky good year.  Great TE2
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Tacklegrapple,5,Fri Jul 17 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"Jordan Cameron.  I think Tannehill is solid at QB, and I think the Miami offense is going to click this year.  I wouldn't touch Allen/fleener only bc it's TD roulette.  Ertz is going to be gone by the 8th, so scratch that.  Eifert is probably a solid pick.  The others I'm a little more ambivalent (eg, Vernon Davis for example has that huge upside, but was awful last year.  SF team issues or aging player issue?  Probably both).  Either way, who cares.  So long as you don't draft two dud RBs, your team will be fine without a decent TE."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Neil_deNye_Sagan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:23:44 2015 UTC,"I like Cameron's situation better, but I'm still worried about his concussion issues. He's going late enough usually that you can take a chance with him."

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Wild_Bill_Kickcock,3,Fri Jul 17 14:28:15 2015 UTC,I'm surprised at some of the names I see going over him.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,LoudSweaters,3,Fri Jul 17 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"Was looking for this one. He's constantly going undrafted in leagues even though he'll be featured constantly in the Bills offense. Roman's offense has been described as ""tight end heaven""."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,SeanJuan,2,Fri Jul 17 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"Eifert was my sleeper TE, but he's waking up.  Now it's Clay.  Super-versatile player that's never going to be off the field, in a very TE friendly scheme."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Talks_to_myself,4,Fri Jul 17 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"Ertz: I think he's got potential, but he's probably my 3rd or 4th choice.  Allen: It's too hard to decide him or Fleener, though he is the more talented player.  Cameron: I like him a lot, just needs thicker helmet.  Owen Daniels: Obviously hinges on Manning, but he is IMO the most worthwhile pickup with the highest upside.  Davis: Safest pick...ish.  Proven and proven again.  Last year I'd like to say was the anomaly.  Walker: He good!  Hopefully Mariota make them better.  Ebron: No thank you.  He was really hyped, but he didn't pass my eye test.  Donnell: Also no thank you.  IMO, most td's are gonna be OBJ.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but OBJ is just so good.  Green: Gates still alive!  Just suspended for four games.  too weird of situation for a pick up only to pick up another 4 weeks later.  ASF: Higher ceiling, way too low floor.  Reed: Also needs thicker helmet.  I like his upside though.  If he plays all the games, I think he's a TE1 no doubt."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,THA-HINRICH-MANEUVER,5,Fri Jul 17 17:41:19 2015 UTC,Coby Fleener in the last couple rounds.

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,humanhighlightreel,-5,Fri Jul 17 03:33:56 2015 UTC,Allen is more of a blocker. Fleener is the better receiver.

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,theDarkAngle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"He is. He had just as many TDs as Fleener in fewer games. Also, it's being reported that Fleener will see a diminished role since Allen is actually healthy now."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,cowmandude,2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Bennett, Olsen, and Julius have been going in rounds 8-12 in every mock I've done.  Witten sometimes goes undrafted, ditto for gates (suspension).  Of the guys you mentioned though, its Ertz for me.  I want as much of that Philly offense as possible."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,theDarkAngle,5,Fri Jul 17 06:18:48 2015 UTC,"Just so you know your mock experience does not reflect most mocks.  Current ADP's: Olsen(5.12), JT(7.02), Bennet(7.03). Witten rarely goes undrafted but is avaialbe typically in the 8-12 realm."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,cowmandude,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"Well yeah I've been mostly doing 10 team.  I saw your other comment; I've always thought of 10 team as standard, if there is such a thing."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,theDarkAngle,0,Fri Jul 17 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"Just as evidence that 12 team is the norm, if you go to any site that lists ADP you will always see the default be 12 team. One example: http://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/adp.php  If you are playing primarily in a 10 team league, you should definitely keep this in mind when your reading articles about where players can be drafted for a steal."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,meverett3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:17:25 2015 UTC,"And on the flip-side, the default league size for NFL.com and Yahoo is 10 teams.  12 is very common too, but 10 is just as common if not moreso."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,cowmandude,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:59:44 2015 UTC,"Just so you know your mock experience does not reflect every league size.  Olsen doesn't go rounds 8-12, but a 7.02 ADP in a 12-team is pick #86, which is 9th round in a 10-teamer, which would land JT and Bennett squarely in the 8-12 range."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,walawoola,0,Fri Jul 17 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"Sure and in a 4 man league JT isn't even drafted.... but I won't post that nugget of information without mentioning it's a 4 team league. The typical league size is 12 man, and when you hear people talk about a player going in a certain round you should assume a 12 team league."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,IlliniXC,2,Fri Jul 17 17:40:01 2015 UTC,"Allen has been going really low, I like him a lot"
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Vancoor,2,Fri Jul 17 12:18:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I don't get one of the top 5 (to me, Gronk, Graham, Kelce, Bennett, Olsen), I'm liking waiting to the last rounds and grabbing a couple. Right now, I think there are pro/cons with just about all of them after that, so I'll grab a couple and hope for the best."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,HurricaneStiz,2,Fri Jul 17 14:58:40 2015 UTC,Caution: Ertz was hyped last year to no avail and Allen is on a loaded colts offense that looks like it may cannibalize itself if you don't get one of the top options. I'm targeting delanie walker and loving it. Dude is a stud going late if you ask me.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Ubitquitus,2,Fri Jul 17 15:24:42 2015 UTC,Clive Walford. Not even getting drafted in most leagues.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,OverallPython,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:41 2015 UTC,This. This guy will be my last pick in my draft but I like what I've read so far about him.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,rhino43grr,2,Fri Jul 17 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"Since nobody's mentioned him yet, I'll throw Josh Hill's name. The coaching staff believes in him enough to let Graham go and not draft another TE, and he's still playing with an elite QB who doesn't have many other endzone targets. The opportunity should be there, but it'll be interesting to see who gets more reps in training camp between him or Watson."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,MahNilla,2,Fri Jul 17 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"Nobody has mentioned Heath Miller? He finished last year as the #12 TE scorer, and I think he easily exceeds his 3 TDs from last year."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,march-4th,2,Fri Jul 17 19:16:52 2015 UTC,"Ertz, Allen, Walker, Donnell, ASF, and maybe Green."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,machinegunke11y,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:10 2015 UTC,I like Ebron as the Lions 3rd option this year. There's a reason he went top 10 last year so I see him bouncing back.  Also like Walford and Rivera from The Raiders. Whoever wins that battle has a chance to be Carr's safety blanket moving forward.
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,march-4th,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"bouncing back from what? The reason he went top ten ( which I dont believe) was pure hype see Green, Ladarius.   He played 13 games started 7. In those games he had only 25 receptions. Healthier Calvin? another year of Tate? Theo Riddick more catches?  I would rather roll the dice on any of the TE's mentioned above or even Vernon Davis to ""bounce back"""
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,LawsBound,2,Fri Jul 17 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Top 10 in the NFL draft, not fantasy.  Bounce back from a disappointing rookie year. I would think with a 1st round investment and his current skill set, it should translate to a more positive second year."

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Ubitquitus,2,Fri Jul 17 11:38:02 2015 UTC,Zac ertz wouldn't even draft himself to his own fantasy team. He knows better
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,Sdstyphoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"I like Green but he will only be viable until Gates returns from suspension and then his value is up in the air. Walker if you can get him late but he's been going in the 7th-9th in mocks I've done. I also like Dwayne Allen, ASJ, Rudolph and Health Miller, all of whom are basically going undrafted and could surprise people."

fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,kandiman3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:56 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of targeting Walker or Cameron. But honestly, I'm going to end up streaming the position. It's hard not too be fooled by a huge week 1 performance, ex. Jared Cook, but it's unlikely that anyone will emerge as a consistent weekly starter.  Even guys like Bennett and Kelce had very up and down performances last year. So I don't see THAT big of a difference between them and the late round guys."
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,IslanderWags,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:30 2015 UTC,I rode Allen and Walker all year last year and had a solid year of production. I'd try the same this year and Allen falls to me in later rounds occasionally. Otherwise I'm willing to take a chance one more time on VD
fantasyfootball,3dl1zd,3ritton,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:01 2015 UTC,"That's interesting about Witten...I'm finding many sites have him ranked in the 7-12 range and he's being drafted as such. I've had no problem getting him in the 8-10 round range in mocks after I have my RBs, WRs, and QB locked-up. I don't think he's going to win any leagues for you, but he's pretty consistent from week to week and has a solid floor.  He's been on a lot of my teams."

They're going to go in the late 2nd/early 3rd in a 10-12 team league.  Kelce provides great value at where he is being drafted and I'm targeting him in all of my leagues.  If he gets taken before I get a chance at him, I'm taking Bennett.  If I have a spot for TE2, based off of value, I'm taking Gates if he is still around.  Walker and Hill tends to fall really deep and NO ONE is drafting ASF.  I might take him with my last pick if I don't end up picking Eli with my QB2."

I went Luck with the number 3 overall pick since it's a 2 QB league and then went Gronk/Calvin Johnson in round 2/3, but I really hate with where that left me at runningback leaving me with Alfred Morris as the best available in round 4. However, I do feel like I at least did a good job of making my next running backs high ceiling guys with relatively low floors hoping that at least 1-2 of them sticks and can produce decent RB1 points. I'm not a fan of my bench WRs though in having Vincent Jackson and Torrey Smith, having both guys with relatively low ceilings in my opinion. I'm really happy with my QBs though, (although I would have preferred Romo over Rivers, but he was taken the pick before). I think Carson Palmer is an awesome backup and drafted him knowing that he could be potential trade bait and then I picked up Bradford extremely late when he kept falling seeing him as a low floor-high ceiling kind of guy who could also be a potential steal and more-so some huge trade bait if he performs well early in the season. I managed to land Parkey as one of the last kickers taken which was nice and I picked Miami's defense, but am probably going to just stream defenses again for the most part as that worked out really well for me last season, but we'll see because Miami's D does have potential to be a top 10 this year.  Also, just as a side note: some of the undrafted guys I'm watching right now are: Doug Martin, Ameer Abdullah, Pierre Garçon, Davante Adams, Breshad Perrimen, Marvin Jones, Percy Harvin, Tyler Lockett, Owen Daniels, Josh Hill, Vernon Davis  So what do you guys think?"

Up to 2 keepers allowed in exchange for 1st and 2nd round picks.  Keepers: Pretty sure I'm going to use my 1st and 2nd round keepers on Dez and Forte.

fantasyfootball,3dmiz5,icystyles,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:47 2015 UTC,My vote is for Bryant.
fantasyfootball,3diz01,humanhighlightreel,13,Thu Jul 16 17:29:41 2015 UTC,"I really like everything but 6-8. I feel like in the middle of the rounds it stops you from just taking value and having a solid team later. You can't go WR-WR at the end, and you aren't getting a top RB anymore. I really think the only thing you can do there is hope for an RB to fall or take Antonio Brown, but then you almost have to take an RB in the 2nd because the talent for top tiers drops so much around pick 30-32."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,IrregardlessYourRong,2,Thu Jul 16 18:00:03 2015 UTC,I'm 7th pick in my 12 man and exactly this problem is killing me. I can either skip Antonio Brown and secure someone like Foster as my RB1 or take AB and then end up with a not as great RB1 that's hopefully still servicable.   The couple times I mocked and did WR-WR I ended up with Alfred Morris as my RB1 and I just don't think that'll cut it (though I did have Antonio Brown and Julio/Calvin which is definitely not shabby).
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Sletts,4,Thu Jul 16 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"If it's a standard league, that isn't too much of an issue. But I'd probably go Foster in that situation and team him with a top tier WR in round two."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,young-steve,2,Thu Jul 16 20:57:43 2015 UTC,"That's where I tend to lean too. Passing on AB in .5 ppr is hard though, but if someone takes him before me it's pretty much a no brainer and I jump to either Forte or Foster."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:45 2015 UTC,"See I'm really terrified of Foster's injury history. He's amazing for sure, but it's not worth it if you're going to have missed games."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,IrregardlessYourRong,2,Thu Jul 16 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"You absolutely have to handcuff him with Alfred Blue.  Not as big of a risk, but I do the same thing with Charles and Knile Davis.  The risk isn't too bad if you do that."

fantasyfootball,3diz01,young-steve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:50:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I recognize that I'm being a little ridiculous. I just don't trust him  to stay healthy as he gets older. I'm probably too conservative but his ADP just makes it too hard for me to pull the trigger.

fantasyfootball,3diz01,young-steve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:08 2015 UTC,And it's not like picking conservative always works. I took Brandon Marshall over Julio last year because I thought Marshall had the higher floor and it blew up in my face.

fantasyfootball,3diz01,young-steve,2,Thu Jul 16 22:16:32 2015 UTC,"It's not a sure thing, but there are always RBs that come out of the woodwork as the season gets underway.  Last season is was Forsett, Denard Robinson to an extent, and Ronnie Hillman/CJ Anderson.  I would rather grab Antonio Brown and another stellar receiver then try to land on one of these guys into the season, than be forced into taking guys just because I need that position."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Count_Long_Dong,3,Thu Jul 16 22:05:30 2015 UTC,But it's not like picking up someone like Foster or Forte is a bad first pick by any means and there are lots of servicable WRs in the 2nd and later rounds.  It's a hard choice either way. Lots of times AB doesn't even fall to me anyway in which case the choice is much easier. No way I take Gronk over an elite RB.
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Sletts,2,Thu Jul 16 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"It's going to depend from league to league.  If everyone is making a run on RBs then you're a bit limited, but as long as there are those people taking elite QBs in the first, the two elite TEs, and maybe a receiver or two, it really helps the people drafting at odd positions."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Count_Long_Dong,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:13:49 2015 UTC,Yeah unfortunately I play in leagues that are pretty traditional and pretty much everyone likes to lock up their elite RBs early. I don't predict Luck/Rodgers going until at least the 3rd round in any of my leagues this year. I also somewhat doubt that Gronk goes first round but anything could happen. I'm hoping I'm wrong.  I'm going to stay fluid and take the best players available to me but also will be paying attention to the positional scarcity because I don't want all the decent RBs gone before I even start taking them...
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:16:44 2015 UTC,"I've done a few mocks, and it's kind of felt like there are more decent running backs available in later rounds than there are wide receivers.  That sounds counter-intuitive, but that's been my experience so far.    Where would you see yourself taking Gronk or Graham?  No way those guys get out of second round, but I can't see myself passing on a second round guy like Jeremy Hill to take a tight end.  Everything before round three feels like a reach, but I know they're worth more than that."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Count_Long_Dong,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'll want to take Gronk or Graham. Graham burned me last year and showed me that although elite numbers from a TE are something to be coveted, blowing your first round pick on the hopes of getting that production just isn't worth it to me."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:22 2015 UTC,"Yep... I dont mind it because Im in a league that I KNOW will see Gronk, Brown, and one of Rodgers/Luck taken first round..  but this is a tough spot to be in this year.

You can snag one of the top RBs (my strong preference is for Charles or Lacy) and then go back to back strong WR. There are usually a few decent RBs left to take in the fourth, and then I start to build depth and pick up QBs. There is so little value at TE that I don't bother trying to get one early."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,bagels666,5,Thu Jul 16 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed - picks 1-3 allow you to get an absolute top RB, and two very good WRs at the 2/3.  Then hopefully another decent RB and WR at the 4/5 turn."
fantasyfootball,3diz01,joshfey,4,Thu Jul 16 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"I've found that you can still load up at RB in the middle rounds despite going WR/WR at the 2/3.

You have to go back to 93 Jerry Rice to find the last time a WR was the top fantasy player by VBD.  You get my point. The only WR recently to a season compared to an elite RB is Calvin in 2011. Yes, sometimes first round RBs fuck you, and first two round WRs are almost always good, but you can always find replacement level talent at the WR position. The same cannot be said about RBs."

fantasyfootball,3diz01,hotpurplesox,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"I'm really liking the mid-late picks in 12-man this year. Quite often one of the top 4 or 5 RBs falls to you because people are taking guys like Gronk and Antonio Brown, and then you have a solid shot to grab another solid RB in round 2 (Foster ideally, or CJ Anderson). Failing the top 2nd RB, I've seen top WRs like Dez or Julio fall go in the early second as well. More than once I've started a team with something like Lynch-Dez or Peterson-Julio from a late spot, and I have my fare share of Lynch-Foster type starts as well"

If you're lucky you'll have one of the top backs fall to you but I am extremely comfortable drafting Brown at 6/7.  On the turnaround I pick up Megatron, Julio Jones or AJ Green.  One of them will be there.  On the 3rd I get my RB.  Usually Morris/Miller will be there but I am picking Forsett above those, then I am going WR @ either DJAX or Allen.  I am praying Randle is sitting there on my next turn."

fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,jmontu1uc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:59 2015 UTC,Have been getting him at good value for the last 4 years.  Big part of the reason I've won that auction league twice and finished a close second in that span.
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,Slapdash13,3,Fri Jul 17 00:52:12 2015 UTC,Lamar Miller - Yahoo currently has his projected auction value at $23. Thats highway robbery for a potential RB1 with almost no capable RBs behind him on a decent offense.
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,FFMonstar,5,Thu Jul 16 19:43:40 2015 UTC,"Except Ajayi is a capable RB. He fell in the draft due to long term health concerns. Short term, he was scouted to be just as good as any RB taken day 2 of the draft"
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,str8_pants,4,Thu Jul 16 21:35:40 2015 UTC,"Eh.  BIG Dolphins fan here. Follow them religiously.  People need to pump the brakes on Ajayi for right now. He wasn't drafted for this season. He was drafted for NEXT season when Lamar Miller walks in FA because our money is going to be tied up in paying Olivier Vernon a shit ton of money.  Ajayi was drafted to be what Daniel Thomas wasn't: Good. Unfortunately, early reports out of mini-camp and OTA's were that Ajayi was dancing too much in the backfield and trying to bounce everything outside. That's not what Philbin wants him to do. Also, you have Damien Williams back there as well who was getting a ton of buzz from Hickey and Philbin this offseason. They are going to use him at some point.  I think this year, the Dolphins ride Lamar into the ground. The last 3 weeks of the season, with the Dolphins still in the playoff hunt, Miami let Miller carry the rock 16, 19, 19 times. With him being in a contract year and Miami knowing full well that he is gone next year, I think they feature him for the majority of the season.  I think Ajayi is an AMAZING value in keeper leagues. However, so is Damien Williams. I think those two cancel out each other's fantasy value this season behind Lamar. It could be a situation where you draft Ajayi thinking he's the clear backup, and then Damien Williams comes in and vultures a TD instead. Watching the Dolphins last year, Philbin worked in Daniel Thomas by giving him his own drives, and I expect that to happen with Ajayi this year too. However, now that Damien Williams is in his 2nd season, he may get some of those touches as well.  I know what Ajayi is as a talent, but people are overhyping him for the 2015 season. NEXT year, this kid is fully unleashed."

I like how his season starts and ends, but that majority (the middle portion) is fairly brutal. Also, with all the passing weapons (Landry, Devante Parker, Stills, Jordan Cameron), I wonder how much more he could possibly be utilized in that offense."
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,FFMonstar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:55 2015 UTC,"I think its a bit premature to avoid players based on their schedules. Only exception is maybe some NFC West players, in a division with SF, SEA, STL and ARI. Even then I wouldnt avoid anyone solely for that reason."
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,jdblad,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"I kept two top WR so I figure I should bid for a top RB, and the top 3 that weren't kept are Charles, AP, and Marshawn. There will be a lot of bidding competition for these three, but I will be targeting AP and Charles and willing to bet as much as I can to snag one of them. My plan is to let the bidding get up to 50 or 60 without making a sound, then when it gets close to having a bidder win, I will attempt a vulture and throw out a bid ten more than what it was at and see what happens. With a starting auction $ amount of 203 (250-47 kept dez 46, odell 1) I am willing to spend a bulk of it, up to 70 maybe 80, that's damn high though, on AP or Jamaal."

I'd agree with you to drop some coin for one of them, then look to get a nice and cheap QB, right now I'll be happy if I get someone like Eli, and hopefull for a Ryan, Romo, or Roethlesberger."

Before our first season with Reid, I had read articles from philly fans saying this same thing! Charles had 7 carries in Week one last season, 3 carries in a half in one of the following games, and 15 for 80 in week 5. The game against the 49ers was the worst(week 5). There were so many 3rd and shorts that we opted to pass for. Reid sometimes forgets he has the most versatile RB in the league. Get him touches!"
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,GOTaSMALL1,2,Fri Jul 17 11:29:45 2015 UTC,Jarvis Landry if you're in PPR. He has real poise in the slot and is set to get a TON of touches.
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,GOTaSMALL1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:48:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't ever bid 'any' price for a player... But there are players where I see value well beyond what they would reasonably go for. Last year that was Antonio Brown... This year it'll be Gurley (auction/keeper leagues). I have the same feeling about him as I did when LT was rookie. Being able to get (and keep) him for anything less than RB1 money could win me my leagues for years.  Full disclosure... Had the same feeling about Lawrence Phillips too... That one crippled me for a few seasons.
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,grandmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"I don't do Keeper leagues, but in terms of this year, I can say that in my opinion Gurley won't do much. He is already injured, Tre Mason is still there, and their division is stingy in Run DEF. In terms of this season, I'm shying Gurley for sure."
fantasyfootball,3dj8vd,mbuff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:06 2015 UTC,I don't disagree. I'm happy to have him for RB2 money for the next three to five years. Having him as my RB2 this season would scare the shit out of me. For this season he would be RB4 on the list of guys I'm targeting.  I also think the NFC west is in its decline as a power defense division.
fantasyfootball,3di09o,nosliw54,31,Thu Jul 16 12:55:05 2015 UTC,"I'll say it again, his price keeps rising to the point where people are drafting him with the assumption that he will play to his hypothetical ceiling, including the jump in production out of Jacksonville's offense to support it.   Right now he's WR28 off the board by FFC ADP, WR30 by FantasyPros consensus rankings. So I think his value isn't ""great"" anymore, it's more in line with consensus opinion. He's certainly not a sleeper anymore. I think he's priced reasonably right now because his draft price is factoring in the risk associated playing in Jacksonville's offense and not having a full season track record of performance."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,MANPAD,3,Thu Jul 16 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, also historically speaking 2005 was the last year the Jags had a receiver go for 1,000 yards"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Pajerski,6,Thu Jul 16 20:25:04 2015 UTC,"I agree that his value at around 30 is probably right, but I also think he has a higher ceiling than the rest of the guys in that area like Roddy White and Michael Floyd."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,MANPAD,14,Thu Jul 16 14:05:08 2015 UTC,"White and Floyd are going a full two rounds later. Going within about a round of Robinson are, in order, DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, Jarvis Landry, Vincent Jackson, Victor Cruz, and Nelson Agholor.   His ceiling is being overestimated by reasonable standards, in my opinion."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,MANPAD,4,Thu Jul 16 14:55:28 2015 UTC,"I was looking at Fantasy Pros ADP, is that not a reliable resource? If he is going more with those guys then that is more of a reasonable value. What do you see as his statline at the end of the year?"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,yurifel,13,Thu Jul 16 15:09:52 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of people bandying about projected stat lines of 1,100 - 1,300 yards and 5 or 6 touchdowns. Personally, I think that's his ceiling. My concerns are that there aren't any strong indicators that Bortles will be any safer in the pocket this season, which will limit his progression.   There's also the assumption that, because he's the best wide receiver on the team, the sky is the limit on his targets. While I agree he's the best WR and he will likely lead the team in targets barring injury, I think it's first of all a little unreasonable to expect him to draw 160 targets. Comparing to last year, that would put him in line with elite WRs on prolific offenses (Julio Jones & Jordy Nelson). Only three WRs in the NFL had more than 160 targets (besides Julio, it was Antonio Brown and Demaryius Thomas). Jacksonville ranked 16 in the NFL last season in pass attempts, so that number could theoretically be there for him. But I'm not ready to even consider 160 targets as a reasonable expectation for him, let along how many will be catchable.   Finally, it's being treated as a foregone conclusion that he will rake in at least 5 touchdowns. I want to be really careful about assuming this is a given, since last season Jacksonville quarterbacks threw only 14 touchdowns total in 17 games, and recently acquired TE Julius Thomas is going to likely be their first look in red zone schemes.   I think he'll be fortunate to break 1000 yards and reach 5 TDs. I wouldn't be surprised if he finished closer to 900 yards and 3 TDs. I just can't see that offense making a big enough step as a whole to support a 1000 yard receiver, even one who's been crowned a stud already by much of the fantasy community, and I'm wary about projecting him to increase his pace touchdowns total from last year."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Lord_Varys,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:05:28 2015 UTC,FFC and MFL10 ADPs seem bit quicker to adjust (or overreact) to market trends than the Fantasy Pros consensus ADP.  Whether that's useful or not really depends on your league.

fantasyfootball,3di09o,mdico91,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:55 2015 UTC,He was a solid start when healthy last year and s by far our best wr. Bortles loves him too. But go ahead let him being a Jaguar be the reason you don't take him.
fantasyfootball,3di09o,kterr101,3,Thu Jul 16 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"He never exceeded 82 yards with more than a half season as a full-time #1, and had just 2 TDs in the same time frame.   It's not that I don't like him, and it's not about him being a Jaguar, it's everyone else who is a Jaguar that's a problem."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Canesjags4life,2,Thu Jul 16 18:30:17 2015 UTC,Technically Cecil Shorts was the Jaguars #1 WR all last season when healthy (only missed 3 games). Robinson may have put up better numbers but that's because Bortles liked him more and Robinson consistently got open. Shorts got shut down often but was the lone receiver in on 1 WR sets and #1 on depth chart. Im nitpicking I know though.
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Canadaismyhat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"He was also a rookie. Even though he never eclipsed 82 yds, he was very consistent until he got hurt.

fantasyfootball,3di09o,odellbeckham13,6,Thu Jul 16 20:31:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see how anyone can trust Blake Bortles and the jacksonville offense. This guy shouldn't even be in the discussion as a top 25 WR, yet his ADP has been rising and its looking like he'll be there very soon"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,rndmndofrbnd,5,Thu Jul 16 13:59:04 2015 UTC,He was on pace for just under 1000 yards last year and top 5 targets iirc. If he finishes top 5-10 in targets he should break 1100 yards and 5+ tds.
fantasyfootball,3di09o,odellbeckham13,2,Thu Jul 16 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"how many games did he play though? you can exrapolate for a full season, but why take allen robinson over someone like Brandon Lafell? or Jarvis Landry? or rookies like Kevin Smith/Nelson Aghlor? or even someone like Aquan Boldin?   All those guys have pretty high floors (aside from the rookies i suppose) and pretty solid upside too (especially Aghlor). Even if ARob is as talented as they say, he's still playing with Blake Bortles. expect some really really volatile results"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,rndmndofrbnd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"The reason he's getting hyped is because of his talent and the fact that he has a higher ceiling than all of those guys named, besides maybe Agholor. I think where he's getting now is pretty fair, but if he keeps going higher then I might shy away. Right now I'm looking to get him in the 6th. I'm not disagreeing with you about the potential inconsistency or the floor of the other players, it just comes down to what people want on their fantasy teams."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,odellbeckham13,2,Thu Jul 16 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"ok but what is his cieling? 1000 and 5? thats what Boldin did last year when the 49ers were constantly running, therefore, Boldins upside is probably greater than ARobs (despite Boldins age). Jarvis Landry put up 84 catches, 750 yds, and 5tds in 15 games, now that Mike Wallace is gone, his upside is like 100+ catches, 1200 yds and 7 Tds. Also, with Landry he'll probably be consistent too cause he gets so many catches. I can go thro all those guys i mentoined, but i think its clear that they all have higher ceilings playing in solid offenses - and will probably be more inconsistent. U could argue that ARob is one of the more talented guys we're disscussing, and might agree with you, but in terms of fantasy production, i think bortles and the jacksonville offense will hold him back. I dont think that team has had a solid starable WR in years"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,rndmndofrbnd,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:22 2015 UTC,"His ceiling this season imo is 85 - 1200 - 8  Thats 5.3 catches, 75 yards, and .5 tds a game. Not unreasonable from a clear number one who's quarterback looked for him as much as Bortles did. If you think Landry's upside is that high then have at it, but he's limited physically and the Dolphins also brought in Stills and Cameron."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,odellbeckham13,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"""If he finishes top 5-10 in targets he should break 1100 yards and 5+ tds.""   that was your prediction a few hours ago right? 85 catches and 1200 yards is unheard of man for a jacksonville WR, ur going against years and years of stats. Bortles has looked terrible thus far, idk how many times he's throws towards AROB, 85 catches is a very hopeful prediction."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,rndmndofrbnd,2,Thu Jul 16 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, if he finishes top 5-10 in targets he should break 1100 and 5. You asked his ceiling, and I answered with 85 and 1200. Targets are one of the biggest factors, if not THE biggest, in terms of wr success. Jacksonville will also be playing from behind more often than not, leading to more throws."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Canesjags4life,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"i disagree, targets dont matter as much when a QB cant complete more than 55% of his passes (bortles actually got worse as the yr went on if i remember correctly). Also, top 5 - 10 in targets? its the jacksonville jaguars - they're not going to be throwing at an unproven wr that much. Look for them to spread the ball and allow bortles to grow as a qb by helping him make quick, easy throws into space. Also, expect them to emphasize the run game. I dont know how succesful yeldon will be, but perhaps they will try to control the game by grounding and pounding - a lot of teams have been succesful by simply controlling possesion using the run game (again, i dont think this will be very efffective, but i think jacksonville will try a lot like the MJD days)"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,jjfreshhh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:35:00 2015 UTC,What are you talking about? Robinson saw 9 targets a game after week 2 last season. That's 144 targets. He was on pace for 77 catches and  nearly 900 yards. 13 more yards a game and he's at 1100.  And targets are the biggest indicator of fantasy wr success   http://pb-cdn.draftkings.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/WR-Stat-Correlations.jpg

fantasyfootball,3di09o,jjfreshhh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:25:55 2015 UTC,"No doubt Robinson's success is totally tied to Bortles being a competent quarterback, but with Julius Thomas in there, and a solid running game- I wouldn't be surprised if they churned out a semi decent offense this year."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,MANPAD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"What makes you think their running game will be improved enough to open up the pass game? Faith in yeldon, or improved OL play?"

fantasyfootball,3di09o,theDarkAngle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Even if Bortles progresses, he was sacked more than any quarterback last season. Even if Robinson can collect 160 targets, how many of those will be thrown under pressure, or be considered catchable targets."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,mdico91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd put it all on Bortles, it's certainly tied to Bortles, because, well...someone has to throw him the ball.  But Allen Robinson is a big dude and a playmaker. I don't know if you watched much of him last year, but a lot of his success came from broken tackles and YAC. If Bortles can get him the ball, I'm confident Allen Robinson can turn it into something. It's just scary having to rely on a player for one or two big plays and (hopefully) a TD to change that goose egg on your roster to a 7-12 spot.   Lately in 12 team mocks I've been seeing him go in Round 8-10. Seems like you'll be choosing him right around the Cruz, T Smith, Kevin White area which seems about right to me, doubt it'll stay that way though. All that being said, I like him, had him last year for a few weeks before his injury and he was consistent and a ton of fun to watch."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,Canadaismyhat,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"I would not be able to pull the trigger on this guy before round 6 or 7.  This offense and especially the QB is a work in progress.  They have several new pieces and a lot of uncertainty at WR just given all the injuries last year.  There is no guarantee that a healthy Marquise Lee doesn't take over as the #1 WR - it seems unfathomable now, but shit like that happens every year.  To me, you don't invest heavily in a guy until he's proven he's worth it."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,chungwildnfree,2,Thu Jul 16 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"If this guy is anything more than a flex in a 12 team league where you also punted on WRs the first 2-3 rounds, you've really messed up."

fantasyfootball,3di09o,humanhighlightreel,0,Fri Jul 17 21:00:29 2015 UTC,The dude is being drafted beside Sammy Watkins right now - Sammy is a much better player on a team that will score more. Robinson's value is terrible.
fantasyfootball,3di09o,tabet,12,Thu Jul 16 14:52:12 2015 UTC,"In what world is Sammy Watkins in a better situation than Allen Robinson? Rex Ryan has never produced a top 25 WR and that's not set to change anytime soon with Tyrod Taylor and EJ Manuel battling it out for the starting QB job and Buffalo trading for Shady. I would take ARob over Sammy in a heartbeat and considering their numbers were really similar last year (both averaged 61 yds/gm, 4-5 rec/gm), their ADP being neck and neck is not surprising at all"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,humanhighlightreel,0,Thu Jul 16 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"Talent. Watkins played most of the year hurt last year, and was huge when he was healthy. Having extra weapons on the field will also only help him - the coverage he faced late year was ridiculous.   Robinson is going to have a hard time scoring this year - Bortles threw only 11 TDs last year and JT is going to be the primary red zone target.   Watkins on the other hand is going to be the Bills' go to guy in the red zone again and his QB, likely Manuel, ha at leasts averaged over a TD a game and is playing behind the best O Line of his career.   The Bills are primed to have a much better offense and I don't think 8-10 TDs is out of the question for Sammy. Rex hasn't had a receiver like him before and you're damn right he's gonna use him."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,jjfreshhh,4,Thu Jul 16 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"Every single on of your points can be made for ARob:  Watkins played most of last year hurt? Allen was hurt. Like, season-ending hurt. Yet, he was bigger than Sammy when healthy considering Sammy had 7/16 games with 50+ rec yds and Allen had 7/9 games with 50+ rec yards.  Watkins might have a hard time scoring this year considering the Bills haven't even picked a QB and their options are between a guy with 0 career starts and a guy who got beat out by Kyle Orton. Oh and Ej's career high in TDs? 11.  You have no idea how the offenses will run and you have no idea who the primary redzone targets will be. The Jets/Rex Ryan had the worst red zone conversion rate in the NFL last year. They primarily ran it in the red zone and that was with Ivory in the backfield. Something tells me Lesean may just get some red zone touches.  Rex Ryan had Santonio Holmes coming off a SuperBowl MVP. He proceeded to wither away and die in NY, along with Plaxico Burress. Are they Sammy-level talents? No. But they were both great WR that straight up weren't utilized.  There is no legitimate argument to be made for Sammy vs ARob that favors Sammy. They're neck and neck and ARob is in a better situation."
fantasyfootball,3di09o,toochunky,5,Thu Jul 16 15:40:53 2015 UTC,"Watkins played most of last year hurt? Allen was hurt. Like, season-ending hurt. Yet, he was bigger than Sammy when healthy considering Sammy had 7/16 games with 50+ rec yds and Allen had 7/9 games with 50+ rec yards.   Except you were using per game stats, which hurt a player who played through an injury and not a player with a season ending one.    Watkins might have a hard time scoring this year considering the Bills haven't even picked a QB and their options are between a guy with 0 career starts and a guy who got beat out by Kyle Orton. Oh and Ej's career high in TDs? 11.   Yes, 11 in 10 games. Bortles' is 11 in 14 games. In both seasons he has played Manuel has had a better passer rating than Bortles. He is simply a better passer, which is saying next to nothing. If the guy (Tyrod) who beats him out gets the start, it is because he is better than both of them.    You have no idea how the offenses will run and you have no idea who the primary redzone targets will be. The Jets/Rex Ryan had the worst red zone conversion rate in the NFL last year. They primarily ran it in the red zone and that was with Ivory in the backfield. Something tells me Lesean may just get some red zone touches.   They also had Geno Smith, who again has been much worse than EJ. LeSean will definitely get some red zone touches, but its not as though the Jags didn't also invest in the run game this year. Bortles can hoof it too. At the end of the day, Robinson had two touchdowns in 10 games last year. He is not really a red zone threat. Sammy is a physical freak, and we do know he will get the ball in the red zone.    Rex Ryan had Santonio Holmes coming off a SuperBowl MVP. He proceeded to wither away and die in NY, along with Plaxico Burress. Are they Sammy-level talents? No. But they were both great WR that straight up weren't utilized.   Santonio Holmes is not nearly as talented as Sammy. Both of those guys were old, solid vets, but not playmakers.    There is no legitimate argument to be made for Sammy vs ARob that favors Sammy. They're neck and neck and ARob is in a better situation.   There are a lot of questions about both situations, but lets start with the obvious:    Buffalo had 8 more passing touchdowns than Jacksonville last year. Jacksonville added one of the league's top red zone options this off-season. Buffalo's biggest addition was a RB who struggled in the red zone last year.   That says a lot in and of itself. Even if Jacksonville's passing game improves and Buffalo's gets worse (it won't), there is a ton of buffer.   At worse, their situations are equivalent. If situations are equivalent, I am going to go with the playmaker who threw up a ton of big games and a bunch of duds when he had broken ribs and a hip pointer, over the guy who has never had a 100 yard game and has 2 career touchdowns.   At the end of the day, Robinson is a mediocre talent who could be surpassed on the depth chart at any minute by the likes of Marquise Lee. Last year he was reliable, but unremarkable. Watkins is an elite talent. The upside is just not comparable.   The biggest thing that separates these two is the old /r/fantasyfootball adage; ""watch the fucking games"""

Overall watkins is the significantly better receiver but his situation is far from ideal"
fantasyfootball,3di09o,jjfreshhh,2,Thu Jul 16 15:08:01 2015 UTC,"Bortles has not been proven to be a competent QB at all. I actually had a long post typed out but it reloaded the fucking page when I kept going back and forth between this app and safari looking up stats as I'm on my phone. But basically Bortles was one of the worst QBs in the NFL last year and even EJ Manuel looked better than him when starting.   But both teams' QB situations suck, so the only things that really matter are: Sammy Watkins is more talented, but the Jags will likely be passing the ball more as they'll be playing from behind more and Rex Ryan loves his run game, especially with that Buffalo defense. Sammy Watkins will also definitely be the number 1 receiver in Buffalo, whereas Allen Robinson could likely be the 2nd or even 3rd receiver behind Julius Thomas and Marquise Lee."

Hell, in PPR /u/Beer4TheBeerGod, who makes BeerSheets suggested taking Brown first overall.  As for Luck, there's a good chance he'll be the highest scoring QB, if someone finds that valuable, that's fine, it doesn't mean they aren't taking the mock seriously.

Don't attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity (or in this case, ignorance).

Yes those are all auto draft, but they use certain metrics so it's not just pulling off a rankings list to formulate other teams.   I've also watched mocks to see where certain players I want are going (Cooks, Randle, Allen Robinson) then specifically targeted those guys in the next mock. So I might be picking them a round earlier than their ADP bc that's what it would take to get them, and someone else might feel it's a silly pick, but now I get to evaluate what my final roster would be and if those targeted players were worth it.

The thing is, if you have the #1 or #3 pick, and you want Luck or Antonio Brown, that will be your only chance to get them. I rarely have top picks, but I've seen so many early draft RB's bust it will make your head spin. Luck and Brown are at least safer than any RB you can take in those spots.  Fun Fact: I'm in 3 leagues, and the winner of one of those leagues took Andrew Luck #1 overall last year."

For example, Yahoo doesn't offer any flexibility, so you can only mock standard stuff. But if you are trying to work out something for your 2QB start like taking Luck first, that is a realistic scenario for him, even though it doesnt work with your plans. Taking Brown is you are in a Full PPR 3 WR start isn't insanely outrageous either if you go for a WR WR draft.  Also, I don't mock to see what my ideal cookie cutter scenario looks like, I mock to experiment strategies and see what I can end up with if I don't take a RB until the 3rd or a TE until the 10th. etc"

fantasyfootball,3dioc8,irieCO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"Do they specify the scoring system in these mock drafts?  They are pretty good picks depending on the type of scoring system you are using.  Maybe the guy who took Luck has a 2 QB league where passing TDs are worth 6.  Maybe the guy who took Brown is in a PPR league.  All in all, I'm not sure mock drafts are that useful if people aren't playing by the same assumptions.  I have also noticed that some people join mock drafts just to test out the drafting software.  Make sure your system is configured properly, learn how to switch up your queue, make a pick etc."

If someone is making actual stupid picks like all kickers or all from one team, then it might skew results, but it will teach you how to be more adaptive. If everyone followed the ADP charts, then what would the point of a mock be.  It's fantasy baseball instead of football, but I've used mocks to try out different strategies and see what kind of team I end up with, like taking all my pitchers first, or filling out my lineup before taking a pitcher."

fantasyfootball,3dijbi,new-money,20,Thu Jul 16 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"Depends where you're drafting.  If it's at the end of the draft, you're getting wr's like Dez, DT, OBJ, Calvin, etc... which is nice.  But come round 3, you're HOPING for Ingram, or Lamar, or ideally Alfy to fall to you.  Then you're either reaching for someone like Ellington, or taking a shot in the dark on Randle, Latavius, Hyde, etc.    The benefit is that you basically have 2 locked in top 8 wr's.  The cost is having a low end RB1 / high RB2 as your #1 and a very risky pick as your #2.  I've done this a lot at 11 in my 12 team mocks this off season.  I think that I can make it work.  The key is to backload on RBs, and target NFL STARTERS, which later may cause a dilemna in picking the right roster, but is a necessary evil for going wr-wr to start.  I follow up my first 4 rounds (wr-wr-rb-rb) by backloading 2 high upside RBs in rounds 5-7: Blount, Abdullah, Yeldon, vereen, ivory, etc.  sprinkle a TE or WR3 into those rounds (Djax, Kelce, Maclin), and lock up a QB in round 8.  My wr-wr teams typically look something like:   Dez DT Ingram/Lamar Ellington Kelce Blount Vereen Eli/Tanne   And then fill the rest of my lineup with high upside WRs (Decker, Randle) and RBs (Bush, low ADP Rookie RBs, etc).  If I don't get Kelce I'm usually taking a later round TE like Delanie, Bennett, Dwayne Allen.  I would take Djax or Maclin in Kelce's place in the example lineup above.  EDIT:  Assuming 12 team league."

fantasyfootball,3dijbi,halfman-halfshark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"I tend to favor RBs with my first pick, but rarely go RB/RB for this reason.   Not having a true WR1 is a major season long headache. I'm fine with that Mike Evans / TY tier, but anything less than that and I'd be pretty unhappy after the draft."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,BookofEliManningFace,15,Thu Jul 16 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"In 2014, there were 23 1,000 yard + receivers and only 13 RBs. 40 receivers caught for more than 850 yards while only 15 RBs rushed for that. 20 RBs had 6 or more TDs, while 45 WRs did.  My point here? WR is a hell of a lot deeper than RB, and the gap between the guys at the top and the guys just below them is much less steep than it is at RB. Sure, great WRs are less likely to bust, but if you totally ignore RB in the first two rounds, it's going to be a lot higher to find even one that will succeed, much less two. And a lack of quality RBs will cripple your team.  I prefer a balanced approach. I usually try to get two of each in the first four rounds, with selections depending on value."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,BlindWillieJohnson,8,Thu Jul 16 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"The data is incomplete though. You have to factor in where those RBs were projected at the beginning of the season. Not all of those that made 1000 or 850 yards were projected to do so, guys you could have taken later. Looking at the stats and ADP, of those 13 RBs that rushed for 1000 yards, only 4 were first round picks, and 3 were second round. Then you've got Le'Veon Bell (borderline 2nd/3rd round pick), Morris (3rd round), Gore (5th), Miller and Hill (middle to late round fliers), and Forsett (waiver pickup). If you don't count AP, none of the first round RBs were busts if 1,000 yards is the benchmark, and 3 of the second rounders would be considered busts, Ball, Bernard, and Martin.  The 1st/2nd round receivers most would agree were bad picks, weren't complete busts, Calvin Johnson and A.J. Green finished with 1,000 yards, Brandon Marshall still finished with 721 yards and 8 TDs.  You could have gone WR/WR and taken guys like Lamar Miller, Frank Gore, Ahmad Bradshaw and Mark Ingram, and picked up Forsett, Hillman, CJ Anderson, Tre Mason etc. on the waiver wire.  Personally though, I'm not looking for year end totals, I want week to week consistency, which is why I like taking receivers early. Beckham had 9 games straight of 90+ yards, that's why he's a first round pick for me this year. As for the late rounders, it's usually easy to tell when a late round running back becomes relevant and will get a lot of touches, whereas you might take a late round WR who will make it to 1,000 yards at the end of the season, but they do it by going boom or bust from week to week and they can be hard to confidently start.  EDIT: I guess what I'm getting at is that using year end totals doesn't tell the whole story. Guys like Hillman, Ahmad Bradshaw and Ingram, didn't finish with 1,000 yards but that's because they weren't fantasy relevant through the entire season, you could be picking these guys up and playing them when they get touches and still get top 10 value out of them for those weeks."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Sqwv,2,Thu Jul 16 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely true, but trying to pick RBs with week to week consistency is even more perilous than trying to find a WR. Outside the first two rounds, there aren't a lot of RBs who can deliver ever single week, which is why most of them are gone by the end of the second round anyway. And if you pick poorly in the late rounds, you can be completely hosed for most of the season.  That's why I prefer the balanced approach. If you split up the superstar receivers and RBs in the early part of the draft, you can usually insure that you have at least one consistent performer from both positions. The rest you can sort out a the year goes on.  EDIT: So I did some digging in the stats, and found something else that backs up my point. You talk about game to game consistency? There were 29 RBs who averaged 50 yards a game or more, and a whopping 58 WRs who did. I consider 70 yards the minimal acceptable performance for an RB1/WR1, so on that account there were exactly 10 RBs who averaged that a game as opposed to 18 WRs.  So I repeat my point. WR is deeper across the board than running back. With a balanced approach, you can ideally get at least one guy at both positions who can deliver week to week. But with a 0RB approach, you risk losing out on one of those ten guys who can always deliver for you. WRs after the first two rounds may not be slam dunks, but htere are a lot more of them who can give you comparable performances than there are running backs. It's just a numbers game."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Thu Jul 16 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"I guess I should clarify that I don't really stand on either side of the argument, and I'm not exactly advocating 0RB. I have been mocking with all different strategies just trying to get familiar with how the draft will play out with each opening strategy, and thought I'd chime in that WR/WR is not a dumb way to start. I think taking RBs early can be just as viable, I like the RBs at the top 5 picks. As I said none of the first round RBs from last year turned out to be be busts outside of AP (which was a freak incident). They all still finished with over 1,000 yards. But if I'm picking 12th I really like taking two stud WRs if none of my top RBs fall to me.  The main thing I took away from last years draft is to hoard running backs, once you are set at all other positions just keep drafting RBs in the last 5 or so rounds 'til you fill your roster, take everyone's handcuffs if they're all that's left. I only drafted 4 last year and my two starters turned out to be busts like week 1 due to injury, I ended the season with 7 on my roster, just playing whoever was getting the work at the time.  I don't disagree that the WR position is deeper than RB, and first round RBs can be just as consistent, but I like that late round RBs are easier to predict when they will get work. As I touched on the previous post, late WRs tend to have random good games, and then drop off a cliff for seemingly no reason, but with RBs you usually get a lot of indications from coaches etc. as to who gets the start and what the share of the carries will be like, and an injury to a star RB can make your benched handcuff an instant starter."

fantasyfootball,3dijbi,cjdarling,2,Thu Jul 16 17:30:31 2015 UTC,"The flaw in the analysis is that in PPR, WRs gain a lot more value. But I still think that the general trend holds that the depth is there at WR moreso than RB, and you can get comparable WRs to the top tier more easily than backs."

fantasyfootball,3dijbi,RandoC,8,Fri Jul 17 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"I feel WR is the easiest to find a replacement for on the waiver wire, and so I am against this idea."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Nkliph,5,Thu Jul 16 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"Last year I went Dez/Julio. Consistent high floor, high ceiling. They'll give you something each week and single handedly win a few weeks for ya.   Downside, you have to nail your late RBs an it takes a few weeks for you to really find your starters. Rounds 3-6 are critical. I had Tate, Gerhart, and Vereen as my my ""Top"" RBs."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,E_Street_Band,5,Thu Jul 16 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"I tried this last year as well with CJ and DT, and then ended up with gio and rashad as RB1&2. I handcuffed with Hill in the draft, but, later dropped him after 4 weeks or so for some waiver wire pickup and rotated bunch of backs for RB1/2 when rashad went down too. I made playoffs comfortably but got destroyed during the playoff week when my opponent has CJ anderson & lacy as solid backs. Not to mention, I lost on bids for forsett, Anderson on free agency etc  I think this strategy might work as long as one of your draft RBs do reasonably well. If both of them fail and opponent's RBs are scoring like 20-25pts a game, there is nothing you can do and you are just a sitting duck. That's the risk especially because a RB1 outscores WR1 on average. You'd probably have to blowup on waivers spending $$ on all the RBs and hope someone works out, for this strategy to work in worst case"

Maybe you would have an argument for Antonio in a deeper PPR league. At positions 10-12, I like two of Dez/DT/Julio/Megatron/whomever-is-your-favorite a lot better than a guy like Shady or DeMarco who have some question marks this year (at least as many as some of the guys going in round 3-6). And you don't necessarily have to hit on your 3rd round RB, the reality is if you grab 4 guys in round 3-6 and you have faith in your evaluation of these guys, you should be able to hit on 2 well enough that you come out even. And even is all you need when you have 2 beast WRs and you win that category week in and week out. Pros: kick ass wide outs. Cons: mediocre Rbs. You don't have to have the best players at EVERY position group, you just have to have the best team. It's up to you how you get that."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,TheNodeWest,3,Thu Jul 16 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"I really like doubling up on WR/WR THIS year in the first 2 rounds of the draft. There are a lot of solid RB2 guys that have RB1 potential that go in rounds 3/4 that I would love to have. example would be Frank Gore, Justin Forsett, Melvin Gordon, Lamar Miller, Alfred Morris, or CJ Spiller/Mark Ingram.   Let's say I draft pick 8 and all the stud RBs are gone. I could get Julio Jones/Calvin Johnson combo. Which is very sexy on paper. Then in rounds 3/4 I could end up with a combo of the RBs I listed previously.   Maybe it's just my personal opinion, but I really love rounds 3/4 RBs this year in comparison to rounds 3/4 WRs. So, going WR/WR would be a solid strategy to pursue this year."

Then probably OBJ or Antonio Brown, or a QB if they're silly.   I then plan to take the best available WR (Dez, AB, OBJ, Demaryius) and then another WR in round 2 if it's the best value.   Then maybe 1 more receiver at some and I've mostly locked down the WR position and I can focus on drafting a bunch of potentially great RBs. I figure I'll get at least 2 starters from that group."

fantasyfootball,3dijbi,DonMegah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:09 2015 UTC,Picking from 1.6 with a similar strategy.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,noonann110,2,Thu Jul 16 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, but I'm not sticking 100% to the strategy. If, for example, AP falls to 1.07 (I wish, lol) I will definitely deviate from my strategy. It's all about finding value, ja feel?"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,DonMegah,2,Thu Jul 16 22:35:44 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I think Lynch is the most likely candidate to possibly still be around and there's no doubt you grab him if he is. I think that RB tier ends there. After busting with Spiller and then Ball last year I'm just not touching Foster or Forte for various reasons. I'll start with Antonio Brown and look for Calvin Johnson or Jordy. Who you like through the draft at RB after the obvious guys in rds 3-4?"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,noonann110,2,Thu Jul 16 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had Lynch fall to me there relatively often. My philosophy with my first rounder is to be as safe as possible, so my big board at 1.07 is Lynch-AB-Dez-Gronk pretty much. Oh, and for my RB recommendations, see above posts in this thread. :) Tell me what you think."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,DonMegah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:53:08 2015 UTC,"Like those guys. Ryan Mathews is a potential goldmine... I'm definitely grabbing him late, one Demarco injury from rb1 status.   I like all the same guys. Am curious how you feel about Gordon and Ingram? Those are two guys of the group I'm not sure how I'd feel if I got out with one of them as my RB1."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,alexFlopez,2,Fri Jul 17 00:22:49 2015 UTC,"I took Demaryius Thomas, Antonio Brown, Randall Cobb and AJ Green with my first four picks. It somehow worked out for me (I traded Green for Leveon Bell early on in the season), but I wouldn't recommend it. My RB2 were a huge problem all season. I wouldn't recommend going really heavy on any one position unless you're going to be super active on the waiver and in trading early in the season"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Fantasy_Addict_69,2,Thu Jul 16 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"That just goes to show, draft best available and trade later. Worked out well for you!"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,humanhighlightreel,2,Thu Jul 16 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"If you are going to do this, make sure you get Miller or Gore in the third, that's all I can say."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,PatDude0000,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"You are less able to draft best player available. If you draft wr/rb, you can. But going WRWR you might have to reach for some RBs to fill a need, while bypassing better WRs that you can't fit in your lineup"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,labarbatron,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:18 2015 UTC,"I did it, and loved it. However, I had to trade like crazy to get a serviceable RB. This year, I will be taking one in the first or second."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,shane727,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:59 2015 UTC,I think going WR/WR as with all strategies should be seen as situational. Got a top 4 pick? Then taking one of the elite RBs should be your thing. Like me and got 13th out of 14. WR/WR is probably what I'm going. And its all because thats probably whats going to be the best value left when I pick.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Cifra00,2,Thu Jul 16 23:15:34 2015 UTC,"Pros: really good receivers  Cons: less good running backs  Honestly though, I don't care the order in which I get my 2 WR and 2 RB plus 1 Flex. If my WR2 produces like a WR1 then it makes up for my RB1 producing like a RB2. I sometimes like going 3 receivers early, even, since then I don't have to worry about the position at all and all my late round fliers can be focused on running backs."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,coltsarethebest,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"Basically you draft BPA, but if I get stuck with two wr in 1 and 2 I'm not feeling great about my draft so far. You just have to take a bunch of high upside rbs late and prey that you hit on 1-2 of them"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Talks_to_myself,2,Fri Jul 17 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"I like the thought of it.  Everyone saying it's stupid to force yourself into a strategy is dumb, and it's true.    Personally, the zero RB strategy is one of my favorite.  After the 3rd round in a 14-man draft it gets pretty tricky and a lot can just go very wrong.    If you have the number one pick, the WR-WR strategy is pretty much impossible though.  By the time it gets back to you, you're gonna end up with Brown and Evans or Hopkins/Sanders/Hilton and that's not nearly as sexy as Dez and DT.    If I'm in the last batch of the draft, I think I'm certain I'll go WR-WR considering what's likely left on the board.    So to answer your question...this is my opinion.  Pros: More stability.  Higher upside.  Easier to trade (this one is big).  Cons:  If your later draft doesn't work out great on the RB's, you better play the WW well.  It's a lot easier to pick up WR on the WW than reliable RB.  Everybody picks up anyone who has even a little value in rb's and their cousins.  You can probably pick up someone who can produce 5-10 points for WR though."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Newm4n,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"I did it last season at the 12th pick by taking Julio and AJ and let me tell you.....I screwed myself, I ended up with Alfred Morris and CJ Spiller has my starting RB's and then the talent after them.......Trent Richardson, I put myself into a huge hole from the start where I had blowup weeks and then ghost weeks.......do yourself a favor and take the best available player and don't corner yourself with a specific strategy. I went 6-7 on the season and was never in a commanding position to even make the playoff's"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,trapper2530,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:47 2015 UTC,It's easier to replace a top level WR than a top level RB.  You cam draft 1000 yd 5 tds late. Doing that at RB is rare and means someone usually got hurt.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,tanu24,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:51:50 2015 UTC,This is terrible advice because AJ Green got hurt so that fucks your year. Also Spiller has always been a bad call as a pick.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Nkliph,4,Thu Jul 16 18:14:01 2015 UTC,But maybe the point is that CJ was one of the better RBs left after picking that late.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Newm4n,2,Thu Jul 16 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"He got hurt but he also put up over 1000 yards and there were some weeks Julio didn't do what he was expected too, go ahead and draft 2 receivers.......do it I DARE YOU"
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,yaboymattyk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:38:54 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna have to do it this year in my 2 keeper league. I'm keeping OBJ and Julio Jones and we lose the pick of the present ADP on draft day (dumb, i know). I feel pretty confident having one, possibly two elite receivers with one good running back and a mediocre one. Just gotta watch the waivers for some back that will break out."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,spartynole4life,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:37 2015 UTC,There is so depth at wideout this season.  I would push for a stud back first.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,DonMegah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"In a normal year I would agree. This year with Forsett, Gore, Alf in the third or fourth you can put together a good squad. I'm two straight years of first round RB busts (spiller, ball) and I want guarantees.   Antonio brown and julio/Calvin/jordy. Gore in a high powered offense that will be in shootouts all year as my RB1 is just fine for me.   Keep in mind, there could be a few RB1's that come off the waiver wire. With this strategy you want to pay extra attention. I think I'm going to go this way in .5 PPR at least maybe grab an RB first in my standard."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,adrianp07,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:06 2015 UTC,I would if you are starting 3 WR's and its a PPR league. Depends whats available too. I wouldnt force it.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,chizzo257,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:00 2015 UTC,"i did this last year and my first RB was Stephen Jackson. but if i hold off on rbs, i usually like to employ my double dip strategy which is to land a qb/wr duo (rodgers/nelson, stafford/johnson, etc) i ended up winning the league."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Yosoff,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:47:31 2015 UTC,"WR/WR makes the most sense in a PPR league with either 3xWR or a flex position.  In a standard league with 2xRB & 2xWR the scarcity at RB would make it a risky move.  That said, your draft plan is only good until the first unexpected pick, usually somewhere in the middle of the first round.  After that it's time to adapt."
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,daddyscientist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:08:33 2015 UTC,WR/WR and then one word:  FORSETT.
fantasyfootball,3dijbi,Fukitfuk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:57:44 2015 UTC,You could always put a package together with one of your WR'S and trade someone for a nice stud RB1
fantasyfootball,3dk0f4,sdishak13,2,Thu Jul 16 22:02:01 2015 UTC,Solid article!
fantasyfootball,3dk0f4,Thefedora1,2,Fri Jul 17 01:15:53 2015 UTC,They have the raiders going 10-6? I'll take that bet.
