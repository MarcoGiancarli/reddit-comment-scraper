progun,3e37ib,jesterk1ng,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:14:53 2015 UTC,The purpose of the act – in concert with the Insurrection Act of 1807 – is to limit the powers of the federal government in using its military personnel to act as domestic law enforcement personnel.

Accused killer Dylann Roof should have been prohibited from buying a rapid-fire .45 Glock pistol on April 11 because he had confessed to illegal drug possession. But the gun purchase went through, partly because “the screener (who was in located in Clarksburg, W.Va., and not South Carolina) never knew full details of the purchaser’s arrests within the FBI’s allotted three-day time period,” the Sun said.  This FBI fumble enabled a self-proclaimed white-supremacist to buy a mow-’em-down gun, go to a black Bible study session, and kill nine worshippers.  Since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act took effect in 1994, federal background checks have blocked 2.4 million gun purchases by convicted felons, wife-bashers, drug addicts, mental patients and fugitives. Yet an estimated 228,000 improper purchases slip through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System at Clarksburg each year, the Sun said.  “And that’s not even counting sales from private sellers to private buyers (including those conducted in conjunction with gun shows,” the newspaper said. “Background checks only cover about 60 percent of gun sales.”  As long as 40 percent of pistol sales elude screening, it’s easy for any dangerous person to arm himself for a massacre.  U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., bravely attempted to extend background checks to cover more purchases, but Republicans in Congress stymied his effort.  We think the Baltimore newspaper is right: It’s good that South Carolina responded to the tragic church attack by removing the Confederate flag — and the fallout also should include more public protections against gun murders."

As far as I'm concerned, the concerns about Marines and their private firearms while confined to the barracks... or the idea of concealed-carrying under your ACUs or something... that shit should be farther down the line. We're putting the cart way before the horse. Right now if you accidentally leave a rifle in your trunk after a weekend of shooting and get searched at the gate, you are tremendously fucked, and are probably going to be in cuffs while your commander and his commander get called.   All I fucking want as a first step is to be allowed to bring a privately owned firearm on base provided that it is stored either in a locking container or the trunk. That would alleviate like 90% of the issues I have with the current handling of firearms. I want to be able to carry my weapon right up to the gate, stick it in a lockbox, and be able to go about my day. The current dumbshit rules essentially strip me of my second amendment right to conceal-carry off base.

I witnessed this dumbfuckery first hand. Hurricane Andrew hit Miami while I was stationed at Ft. Bragg. They told us to draw arms and that we were going to go assist with the relief efforts. From the lower enlisted there were some serious questions, usually along the lines of ""What the, are we going to war with Florida?"" So they issued arms, but did not issue ammo. So there are hundreds of military members there, with guns, and nothing to shoot, or to even shoot at. The story is that a Marine who was standing watch on a street corner somewhere with his M-16 was talking with some locals, and one asked if his gun was loaded. When he responded ""no"" the local drew their own weapon stating ""mine is"" and told the marine to hand it over. About 10 minutes after that happened, we were told to stack arms. (Still wondering why we drew them in the first place.)  I have never had much respect for any upper level brass after that incident, because that just proved to me that they were morons."

All life is sacred except for yours when you want to try to defend yourself. Then you're the asshole who should have just cooperated with the criminal because he probably would have stolen your gun and shot you, as I remember reading the study that your own gun was multiple times more likely to be used against you. Which I am sure completely accounted for the fact that by pure ownership, proximity of, and extended use of any object your likelihood of being injured by it jumps up by virtue of it existing around you in temporal space. Also, an armed private citizen never stopped or ended crime because of a couple times they couldn't. Therefore they never do, and never have, and no one should have a gun except our highly trained police and military, whom are not ever prone to violence.   Guns are scary. But you're the scared one because you have a gun. I don't know you personally, but I'm going to assume the only reason you own a gun is because you want to kill people, because that's my paranoid doomsday scenario and possibly something I would like to do myself.  UK is way better than U.S.. See, there, they have the National Health.  And instead of holding the ideal that both concepts, affordable/free healthcare and the right to keep and bear arms, can coexist, I will instead invest in a false-dichotomy of which  I know nothing about and focus on one positive of a government construct before forming a Utopian ideal around it and ignoring the other grievous short-comings. Because I only point those out about the US.    See?  Edit Oh, I also forgot to add that your gun is an extension of your penis. If you have a firearm, your genitalia must not satisfy your lovers, so having  gun should give you a sense of ""manliness"" and does not disregard that the two concepts are completely unrelated when discussing psychological issues regarding gender identity and self-worth.

Theoretically, the commander can arm his troops if there's a threat, but that's a huge risk, so that's not gonna happen either.

I had carrying, then walking up to a place I expected to be able to go only to see a new ""no-guns"" sign. Also, it would be nice to be able to carry to/from these places (which might be a dangerous trip), even if I had to disarm when I got there."
progun,3dvp8z,StudlyMadHatter,3,Mon Jul 20 14:58:06 2015 UTC,"Just rename then ""Victim Zones"" to make it clear that everyone in the zone is unarmed and vulnerable, so that we're all clear on what they really are.  Then, anyone who enters can know the risk."
progun,3dvp8z,deck_hand,3,Mon Jul 20 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"Gun free zones don't work and only serve to provide the illusion of safety. I've heard antigunners tout studies that claim that shooters do not intentionally target gun free zones on the grounds that everyone else will be unarmed, thus gun free zones are good and effective. But even if the study is true, mass shootings tend to gravitate toward gun free zones regardless of the shooter's intent. The irony is that antigunners claim that we only carry guns because we are scared and want to feel safe. They then turn around and declare that gun free zones envelope everyone in a bulletproof energy shield of happiness and safety. I'm not saying that a gun guarantees absolute safety, but I'll take one over a GFZ any day."

progun,3dx42u,Athena_Penelope,9,Mon Jul 20 06:51:38 2015 UTC,"To borrow an english term,  We need this law guys...There are tons and tons of pensioners out there shooting up schools. Why would a disabled pensioner need a gun anyways? its not like they would ever be the target of abuse or violence nor would anyone ever try to steal from them or mug them.   next on list is preventing pregnant women from owning guns, they could harm the fetus! of course abortions up to 8 months would still be allowed."
progun,3dx42u,Majsharan,3,Mon Jul 20 14:31:21 2015 UTC,"Oh no, it is much better than that. If you are found to be ""unable to mange your finances"", then they automatically assume your are mentally INCOMPETENT and cannot own guns. So they add you to the background check list, blocking you from buying guns and making it more likely that your guns will be confiscated.   So now being poor is grounds for losing your guns. if your parents/grandparents aren't rich and get hit by fincanal trouble like anyone else, THAT IS ALL IT TAKES FOR THEM TO LOSE their 2A rights.   And best for last Obama did this all with out congress, he is deliberately circumventing them to take our constitutional rights simply for being poor.  Edit: also good luck if your only physically disabled in some way and need SS to get by."
progun,3dx42u,triarii7,3,Mon Jul 20 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"Taking this to it's logical conclusion(or, where I see it anyway), I see this getting to the point where the argument will be made that you cannot own a gun if you are in debt.  Then it will be if you have ever been in debt in the past x years.  What about making a mistake on your taxes?  That could be counted as debt as well."
