greentext,3cjj8i,Greenblurt,3,Wed Jul 8 15:53:50 2015 UTC,I've visited random suburban areas with house numbers occasionally pushing 5 digits. How? I have no idea.
greentext,3cjj8i,RuthlessTomato,7,Wed Jul 8 16:19:27 2015 UTC,"House numbers in the US aren't based on your street length, they're based on your block location. The block is numbered based on how far it is from the 0 point in your area, which might be a city center or a county center. Each block gets 100 numbers, so for example if you're on the 35th block (which is often called ""35th Street""), you could get a street number anywhere from 3500 to 3599. Considering each block could be 1/10th of a mile or even shorter, those numbers can add up fast. Once you get out to the suburbs of a reasonably large city, it's very easy to get into 5 digits unless for some reason your area has decided to set new 0 points along the way.   Google ""street numbers"" and the name of your area, and there's usually an article describing how your area is set up and why."
greentext,3cjj8i,FountainsOfFluids,2,Thu Jul 9 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"At least where I live old houses were given numbers based on how far they were from the start of the road. It has since changed, but most of the older houses are numbered with big numbers. Like my parents' house is over 100, even though there are like under 10 houses on that road."

greentext,3cjj8i,Spax_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"No, he just travels the road in one direction delivering the mail to the designated targets and then either continues through or goes back the same road. Not really rocket science :D the numbers are in order anyway, since ofc the further houses have bigger numbers since they're further down the road.   I'm not sure but I believe new houses are built with the same number system if the entire road is with the old system. Would make sense since that way there wouldn't be scrambled numbers."

greentext,3cjj8i,TheDoctorEngineer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"Because the first 3 numbers are the street number, the last 2 are the house number on that street  If I say 13254 8th Ave. South, that translates out to a house on the corner of 132nd Street and 8th Ave, and the 54th house.

greentext,3cjj8i,psycho1social,2,Thu Jul 9 02:41:21 2015 UTC,"I have to say, so long as you've got highways here and there, it's really convenient and organized.   Just from my experiences traveling, I think it's much easier for traveling relatively long distances than old narrow winding roads in Europe and some of the Eastern US.  Although I will say, windiness looks prettier.  Edit: Why did our posts get downvoted? I literally just showed a picture of Phoenix and you said that you liked non-grids more. Weird."
greentext,3cjj8i,thebiggestbooty,2,Thu Jul 9 03:57:02 2015 UTC,Not to mention wobbly english roads are a lot more fun to drive on. All we have is straight roads with a good view of some wilderness. Maybe a curve every 10 minutes
greentext,3cjj8i,Greenblurt,0,Thu Jul 9 05:48:27 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work like that, the first two numbers is the street/ave number, in this case 32nd Street/Ave. The 42 denotes that it is the 42nd house on said street.  The house is at the corner of 32nd Street/Ave and W. Pennywood Lane and it's the 42nd house down."

The Australian Parliament decides to give him the additional punishment of a boot to his buttocks, but the Simpson family refuses. Bart later changes his mind and agrees to the punishment, but just as he is about to receive it, he moons the Australians and the family flee back to America.

I just think that -if any of this shit is real- the OP hit a real low point there. I know the greentext is supposed to be funny, and a lot of greentext involves the Anon tricking/harming other people in some way. But this one just rubs me off the wrong way.   The girl sounds (to put it nicely) naive, and the OP cold heartedly manipulated her misguided affection for him. When she finally knocks some sense into herself, she'll be genuinely heartbroken. And all because the OP needed a few more jaypeegs for his spank bank. Channers see shit like this and giggle their shit off, but the moment a girl rejects them ""TFW no gf"", ""All womenz are hoars and naturally inferior"", etc. And they wonder why they can't get laid.  Sure, it's certainly not the worse that's come out of a site who's finest moments include doxxing and harassing the families of suicide victims.

greentext,359mc9,Nickl140,6,Fri May 8 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"Fortunate Son:       ""Fortunate Son"" is a song by Creedence Clearwater Revival released on their album Willy and the Poor Boys in 1969. It was released as a single, together with ""Down on the Corner"", in September 1969.  This song reached #14 on the United States charts on 22 November 1969, the week before Billboard changed its methodology on double-sided hits. The tracks combined to climb to #9 the next week, on the way to peaking at #3 three more weeks later, on 20 December 1969.  It won the RIAA Gold Disc award in December 1970.  Pitchfork Media placed it at number 17 on its list of ""The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s"".  Rolling Stone placed it at #99 on its ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"" list. In 2014, the song was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""

As someone who is an atheist who studies euphoria, I am telling you, specifically, in atheism, no one calls trilbys fedoras. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you should too. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""fedora family"" you're referring to the euphoric grouping of le reddit army, which includes things from neckbearded gentlesirs to highly intelligent intellectual like Smoke Degrasse Tyson, Reddit's Chief Supreme Ambassador of atheism and logic.  So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people ""say that only neckbeards wear fedoras?"" Let's get Mountain Dew and Doritos in there, then, too.

greentext,331hwe,TheDoodleNoodle,10,Sat Apr 18 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"There was a neckbeard who called himself ""shadowfang"" and tried to be cool by bragging about stories that never happened and is a cut above the average otaku idiot. This guy was one to run around like they do on naruto and setting pencils on fire with Bunsen burners and waving them around calling himself a ""fire bender"" and all manor of foolishness. OP just laughs at him behind his back at first. Then otaku man decides to challenge him to a battle because he heard ""OP and his lady friend were well known throughout the school for their martial arts"". OP says nope and ignores the idiot and just walks into class. Shadowfang wouldn't let that stop him so he just dived into class and said ""There is no escape. You shall perish!"" and got kicked out of the room. A week later Shadowfang does it again and pulls a cheap shot. A year later OP gets a cheap shot of his own in a crowd of people walking by on the last day of school. Then the year later they're all seniors and the senior project starts coming around. OP hears Shadowfang bragging about his bigass card collection he keeps in his locker with this $300 card in it. Shadowfang also says that he's going to make his project about that card collection. So OP gets his group of friends and decides that they're going to fuck up his whole collection because Shadowfang is an idiot. So they stay after school and wait till he leaves and breaks into his locker. from there they ripped em, soaked em, burned them, etc. they also threw in a few porno cards. OP saves the $300 card for himself however. OP then spends the night having a fap session and cums all over it to make it crusty and smelly. On the day of the project, Shadowfang passes the cards around and the board of education sees all the porn cards and eventually, the cummed on card. Shadowfang is then held back a year while OP and his friends make it to their freshman year of college. The End. TL;DR OF THE TL;DR: OP HOLDS BACK AN OTAKU FROM GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL"

greentext,32seno,gnomeyhomie,31,Thu Apr 16 09:48:17 2015 UTC,Lost me when the movie theater had security guards. And one of them was Ray. Yeah ok.   The rest of it was glorious.
greentext,32seno,Dakrys,17,Thu Apr 16 12:59:49 2015 UTC,"He lost me when he was ""close to getting his PhD"" within a year of starting. Can I transfer to whatever program he's in? :P"
greentext,32seno,nmezib,16,Thu Apr 16 13:58:22 2015 UTC,That went completely over my head tbh. When people start talking about their degree paths and career success I just hear this buzzing like there's a bug in my ear and I focus all of my attention on making it stop.
greentext,32seno,Dakrys,20,Thu Apr 16 14:00:51 2015 UTC,"""Holy shit it's Ray""  K"

greentext,32seno,nmezib,13,Thu Apr 16 13:58:55 2015 UTC,That was glorious.
