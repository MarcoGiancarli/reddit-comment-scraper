redditblack,3dy6j6,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:24:37 2015 UTC,This is just a straight up vinyl cutter. Any multicolor things would have to be done by hand. I'm mostly talking single colors - though I could ship you the lettering and a background cut too and you could assemble yourself.
redditblack,3dy6j6,lilnest25,2,Mon Jul 20 19:43:25 2015 UTC,Ahh ok gotcha - didn't know the specifics. Solid letter coloring would be pretty sweet as well. I'd pre-order
redditblack,3dy6j6,eSchiro,2,Tue Jul 21 01:50:20 2015 UTC,I think just having a plain [rBLK] would be pretty awesome to have. Whether they come in a variety of colors or not doesn't bother me a lot. Just having the decal alone is pretty awesome. I'd be more than willing to pay $5 of a pack of different colors or just the same one over and over again.
redditblack,3dy6j6,geekier,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:24:00 2015 UTC,I'm down with that too. I was confirmed access to the vinyl cutter next month. So yeah...gonna get like an official order thread going soon.

redditblack,3dy6j6,dRwEedThuMb,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with Blastergasm, having a black background with a red/orange [rBLK] would look fly af.  Edit: What about controller decals?"

redditblack,3do0lb,dRwEedThuMb,3,Fri Jul 17 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"You're trippin, homie. I play the midfielder role usually and make sure that the ball doesn't cross over onto our side. It's not worth it to chase the ball when two of your teammates are chasing the ball and probably have a better shot. If I would have chased the ball at :41, it's unlikely that I would have been in position to score the game-winning goal. When this clip happened, somebody in my chat acted like they were going to donate $2000 so I was a bit distracted by the chat at the moment, but I usually center the ball many many times a game.   Also, do you guys have the option to save replays on the PSN side? You might be able to record some gameplay footage that way."

redditblack,3dmhmn,sauce687,11,Fri Jul 17 22:15:56 2015 UTC,"Alright story time!   So yesterday after some early afternoon streaming I get off and decided to take Mason to the dog park that we have here. We arrive at the park and a couple of other regulars are there with their dogs already (a nice chocolate lab and some kind of scruffy mutt I don't know what it is). Mason hops out the car and I don't even have to watch him at this point he just bolts off over to his buddies. I go over to the bench where the other dogs owners are and say hi and start talking to them. Now normally vendors aren't allowed at this park but today there is a group of what I assumed were Girl Scouts on the other side of the park selling something. I asked the other 2 people if they had noticed what they had any idea what they were selling and they didn't have a clue. Being the nosey nelly that I am I went over an introduced myself and to see what was up. Turns out they were selling birdhouses which were really nice and I decided to get 2 of them (one for Alexis and one for my mother).  I asked them how much they were and this little girl looks at me and says ""I need about tree fiddy"". At this point I realized it was no Girl Scout selling birdhouses it was an 8 foot crustacean from the Paleolithic Era asking me for money! I said, ""I ain't givin' you no tree-fitty, you goddamn Loch Ness Monster! Get your own goddamn money!"". After that Mason and I had fun at the park and came home after about an hour and a half. We had a blast."

But really, I'd reckon any of the deals that were available for prime are available at different times of the year if you just look for it. Same goes for Black Friday deals.   The only thing I took advantage of from Amazon was the 15% off amazon warehouse products. I've saved so much money buying things ""like new"" or in very good condition. I've purchased monitors, televisions, consoles, printers, hard drives (I know, not something you want to buy used), etc. A lot of the stuff is still in the packaging and just can't be sold as new.   I almost bit the bullet on a ps4 bundle from Amazon but they ended the sale at 65% claimed and I found a much better deal at Best Buy anyway.

November is a good idea for deals, good point you make there"
redditblack,3de1hb,sauce687,2,Wed Jul 15 15:33:30 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty decent deal man. In all honesty, if you truly want something now, just go and get it. There will unfortunately always be better deals and sales on things, but the discounted price will be like $20 difference or just different games. The questions that I would answer myself would be:  Whether you are ready to pull the trigger now?  Do you like the games in the bundle?  Is a possible price difference really worth waiting  until October?"

Graphics wise I don't notice too much of a difference, but that's just me and my vision (which is not perfect).  Controller wise the X1 is better for me with the offset analog sticks - using the left thumb to reach down for the dpad feels more comfortable, again this is just preference because I have huge hands. I might be missing it - is there an easy way to mute chat from the ps4 controller?  Other than the controller, I prefer the x1 interface, but I'm also more used to it.  Other than controller/interface I mostly just buy games based on where I have the most friends playing that game."

redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-10,Wed Jul 15 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I have a little something to say here. I don't mean to hijack your Community Night thread, but you decided to use it for the ""we will punish you"" stuff, so here it is.  It is awfully pretentious of you and the mod team, or at least comes off as such, when you all assume to be able to talk to people that way. I don't know how much time any of you have had managing in real life...don't really care tbh, but I can tell you that trying to rule by fear only pisses people off. Case in point, you all tried to say ""we will step in and shut the Groupme down."" But I have only heard of more chat rooms opening up. Sure you might not gaf if there is a Groupme, but you should respect that some people don't have to follow your command.  So far I have been extremely underwhelmed as to how things have been handled. You all get pissed if someone asks a question more than once or mentions the use of a chat you don't like. You are not parents, you are not presidents or directors, you are not bosses. You are a mod team of a gaming community that are there to manage the gaming community. Sure sometimes people act immature, but that does not mean you are a parent. Shotgunning out a ""we will handle it"" yadda yadda...doesn't go far. Especially when the mod team is disrespectful. Yet another case in point is NabruD openly and blatantly bashing my Twitch stream to a game Dev. Sure you claimed you handled it and say ""he's got stuff in real life"" or ""he's not on the mod team anymore."" We all have stuff in real life and he was at one point. The damage has been done now.  The point is you all are not perfect. I got dragged into some crap with Doom that I had nothing to do with. You tried to tie my hands. I try to grow my Twitch. My channel gets attacked. I am irritated, and from what I can tell, I am not the only one around here. You should take a step back and think about things before you say them. I may speak for myself, but I will pack my stuff and walk before feeling threatened in a game community. Maybe you don't gaf, but if you don't gaf too many times to too many people, rBLK will dwindle. And I haven't exactly seen people flocking to join."
redditblack,3d4qiv,007chill,11,Mon Jul 13 18:22:26 2015 UTC,You viewbot and have a chat bot. It's super obvious.
redditblack,3d4qiv,SpeclalK,4,Mon Jul 13 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"Just do what I do, unfollow the channel and report the stream every time that you see it live. I've been doing it for around a month ever since I called him out in his chat and he ignored me."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Please do unfollow it. All in all, I feel pretty accomplished to see how easy it was to reduce grown men to a bunch of sniveling crybabies over a Twitch stream. Lol."
redditblack,3d4qiv,captngiveafawk,2,Mon Jul 13 22:09:04 2015 UTC,I am going to have my contact at twitch look into your channel tomorrow and see if it is true.

redditblack,3d4qiv,tommynottom,4,Mon Jul 13 23:43:21 2015 UTC,Thank you. Am I going insane?
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-6,Mon Jul 13 19:40:37 2015 UTC,"Again, I will point to what I typed below. Why do you care so much? Lol."
redditblack,3d4qiv,SpeclalK,4,Mon Jul 13 19:47:00 2015 UTC,"Because your stream is the AIDS that ruins the Twitch community. Instead of working hard for content and viewers, you cheat. It's no different than hacking in a game and rBLK doesn't associate with cheaters. If your content was engaging and entertaining, it would grow on it's own. Instead you viewbot because nobody watches. ""If people ain't eating what you're cooking, stop being a chef."""
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-5,Mon Jul 13 21:09:16 2015 UTC,I guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion even if it is naive and ignorant.
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-6,Mon Jul 13 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, why do you care? If my chat is being view and chat botted, what does it matter to you? Is it because you haven't been successful with Twitch and afraid I will be? I just don't understand why you all care so much about what happens in my channel. You know the cool thing about Twitch? You don't have to watch it."

redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:41:27 2015 UTC,I am curious as to what I can't be serious about. His stream is not partnered and therefore is no more successful that anyone else's. It is simple really. Just because he streams from a PC doesn't necessarily mean his is better. Le sigh.

redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"Lol, I guess we see the maturity come out in full force here.  But you are probably right. I likely won't get partnered or make a successful channel. OMG, my life will end, and now I will go around bashing other people because mine is not successful."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:22:05 2015 UTC,"How do you work? You play video games every now and then. Give me a break. You act like you are out in the prison yard breaking rocks.  And yea, cursing me and calling names in a debate is pretty immature. Don't worry though, we are all guilty of it on occasion. ;)"
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:28:02 2015 UTC,Lol. Not a whole lot to say in response to this.
redditblack,3d4qiv,8306623863,3,Mon Jul 13 19:30:48 2015 UTC,"In my opinion Grant has been successful on Twitch, I just think it grinds peoples gears when people get shit given when they've worked hard for it."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"The only successful Twitch streams are partners. I haven't been given a thing. I am streaming as much as I can with what I can. I never asked anyone to come promote me. I made one post saying what I was doing and even deleted it after a little bit because I didn't want to look like I am begging. Regardless, there has been a lot of hate on my channel for no reason. I am working as hard as I want for something that will in no way affect anyone else one way or another and there is nothing but hate.   Sorry dude, but I don't find any validity in your comment."
redditblack,3d4qiv,8306623863,3,Mon Jul 13 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"It depends what the streamer sees as success, if they are doing it for money then your point is correct. But if they do it for fun they're successful as long as they're having fun"
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think we all know what this is all about. If he is only doing it for fun, then good for him. I would like to make partner and so would Apologician I assume. Otherwise I would not be irritated that there has been so much disrespect and hate on my channel."
redditblack,3d4qiv,DevmasterJ,6,Mon Jul 13 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"This comment to me is confusing as shit. I'm gonna address stuff line by line where I feel the need to comment.    ""It is awfully pretentious of you and the mod team, or at least comes off as such, when you all assume to be able to talk to people that way."" - I have no idea what this sentence is implying. As leader of rBLK if I feel like a member is being a dick to someone to the point where I have to step in I will 100% message both parties and get to the bottom of the issue. We still do this now, there is no ""dont talk to me like that"" that goes on. No clue where that is coming from. If you have any specific examples please let me know.    """"we will step in and shut the Groupme down."" - The way groupme works is only the original owner / creator can delete a groupme. The initial xbox groupme is owned by tasty, so Yea we could shut down the xbox groupme. Any other group-me's that pop up we have 0 control over. rBLK uses hipchat, if you want to use groupme by all means go for it, but any issues that come up involving a groupme get the nice response of ""The rBLK supported chat client is hipchat"". Again, I don't care if you use another chat client, but when members come to us and say ""blah blah just happened in groupme"" my response is always, dont use groupme.      ""you should respect that some people don't have to follow your command."" - This isn't some police state, you do realize the only thing the mods ask out of members is to be a skilled player and not a total asshole to others/ other members. Seriously its not like we are up here barking out commands, we are playing videogames. The only times we message people are when two members get into an arguement, or when someone says something stupid on twitter.      ""You all get pissed if someone asks a question more than once"" - ""Did we opt into diamond yet? I give 0 shits if you want to ask the same question over and over it doesnt bother me. If you have actual non circle jerk questions you are supposed to message the mods and we will tell you anything.    ""Especially when the mod team is disrespectful.""  - Let me know exactly who is being disrespectful, if you want to PM me then by all means.    ""NabruD openly and blatantly bashing my Twitch stream to a game Dev."" - I was in hipchat when this happened, Nab is no longer a member of Reddit Black as such I cannot control what he decides to post on twitter. When this happened, caddy reached out to you and Nab and resolved the issue. Again, you are saying ""You are not parents"" but you want us to get involved when someone not in rBLK makes a tweet about you? We did reach out because Nab was in rBLK. You cant say ""Dont mod us"" but ""help me when someone is bashing me"".    ""I got dragged into some crap with Doom that I had nothing to do with. You tried to tie my hands"" - We messaged you about this when it first happened, we literally came to you to get the story and now you are using it as an example of things we are doing wrong? I hate twitter arguements and frankly I'm growing real tired of telling people to stop them. Being in the rBLK community isnt some right that everyone gets, there are rules and guidelines that everyone has to follow. Anyone who continously tries to bend or break rules is handled via the mods, if it leads to being removed then so be it. I dont know why this is a hard concept. Again, if you dont like any of these rules shoot us a message and we can talk about them.    "" I will pack my stuff and walk before feeling threatened in a game community"" - How has any of this made you feel threatened in anyway. Literally the rules im trying to put in place are #1 Act your fucking age on twitter. #2 Dont be a cunt.    Again, if you want to chat via PM im all ears."

redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 21:09:57 2015 UTC,K. This is the second time you all have said this. The first I am getting threatened by Doom and Tasty tells me I can leave and you all say I can't respond and now you tell me to leave because I won't respond line by line when I would rather talk if you feel the need to address this?
redditblack,3d4qiv,realbynight,5,Mon Jul 13 23:48:35 2015 UTC,Seriously dude. You wrote a fucking essay that people read and can't be bothered to read blacked out's response? No offense? That's just immature and dickish
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:31:09 2015 UTC,People only read and responded to what I had to say because they want to hate on me. I do not want to break my entire post down line by line here and respond to everything in writing because then it would be long and drawn out and this would all be much easier to talk about then type. But you call take it how you want I guess.
redditblack,3d4qiv,dRwEedThuMb,3,Mon Jul 13 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"I read and responded to you and I didnt want to hate on you. I read and responded because you were a member. Its not all about hating on you. Additionally dude Im still neutral here, but Blacked Out gave a thoughtful response to your issues and your post saying tldr gave off that you could care less what he had to say just wanted to say your piece and fight rather than talk."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"I have not fought, I have made my point and defended it. I have been fairly respectful in my responses and they have been thought out. I have read everything written. If I choose not to respond to a long post then I have that right. If Blackedout, you or weedthumb want to say I should leave because I didn't respond line by line then that is what it is. It all goes back to the fact that some people think that was they say is matter of fact. Blackedout's response is no more important to me that anyone else's honestly. I said what I have to say. No response but I will chat with you if you like. If not, then so be it."

redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:44:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, come on. I read it but don't have the desire to respond to everything here. Hence why I offered for him to talk to me in game chat. This has already gotten too exhausting."

redditblack,3d4qiv,Apologician,4,Mon Jul 13 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"I try to grow my Twitch. My channel gets attacked.   Really, Kizzle? Don't play the victim card here when you are fully aware of what you're doing and why you're getting attacked for it. Dan is ""openly and blatantly bashing"" your Twitch channel because using a viewbot when you're literally putting zero effort into streaming is fucking wrong, dude."
redditblack,3d4qiv,tommynottom,-2,Mon Jul 13 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's right. Really dude. You don't know me or what is going on, you are only assuming to know. But I suppose it is okay to openly support Apologician's who is clearly being botted from the beginning of him starting and getting 4-500 channel views when he is not online? Everyone around here is in his channel acting like it's okay, but all I get is a bunch of haters coming into mine talking about my stream or me. Go sip on your haterade some more. I don't know why I am being botted or by who when it happens. I don't really care. Why do you care so much? Hater.   putting zero effort into streaming is fucking wrong, dude.   Lol. I mean really? Did someone take your binky? Are you the Twitch police now? Channels get botted literally all the time. But it's ****ing wrong? Really dude? Go cry to your mom.  And regardless of what you think about my effort or if I am being botted, a Dev tweeting me out is awesome for exposure. So because I am being botted, I don't deserve it? What makes my stream any less than someone else's? I have seen some streams around here, and they are nothing special. Never said mine was. Like I said, just a bunch of haters cuz they ain'ters."
redditblack,3d4qiv,Apologician,3,Mon Jul 13 20:51:12 2015 UTC,All I'm going to say is I am doing nothing but streaming for hours and hours on days and doing giveaways to build my channel. Absolutely my stream has been botted at times and if you go back and watch the streams I openly say it is and that whoever is doing it needs to stop. I don't get why you feel the need to drag my name into this when I haven't said or done anything to you but oh well. Good luck in the future with your stream.
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I've seen you grind every day and put a legitimate effort into streaming and you deserve the success that you've seen. Viewbotting happens, I've been viewbotted randomly a couple times, but it doesn't happen literally every stream, nor does it happen immediately after you go live. However, the fact that Kizzle won't acknowledge whether or not he is botting his own channel, or isn't, is what infuriates me the most about this situation."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,2,Mon Jul 13 18:29:21 2015 UTC,If he is constantly viewbotting then oh well. The chances of a stream growing that is constantly botted are very slim. Plus I'm also worried about me and the people who support me and also the ones who I support. I just want the shit to be done with and have everyone move on and go about their business. Also I don't know if you heard me yesterday but thank you for hosting my channel.
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"Lol. So because there is a time delay in when he gets botted, it is okay. This has gotten a little silly now."
redditblack,3d4qiv,realbynight,-4,Mon Jul 13 18:56:08 2015 UTC,"It is sad that you are infuriated by me getting view botted. So every time I stream and do get botted, I am to just repeat ""I'm being botted"" over and over and over? Will that make you happy? Lol, and you called me immature."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,0,Mon Jul 13 19:01:01 2015 UTC,"I have done the same thing. I have streamed for hours and hours daily as I can. Go check my VoD's...or don't. I don't care. It is nothing personal to you, but a mod helps your stream and tried to hurt mine when we are doing nothing different. That is irritating. Also, I have had people come into my stream (you included) and talk smack about something, presumably because my channel is getting views. No. Do I acknowledge? Of course. What reason is there to put my channel down because of it? What, because Dan or Tommy think they are the lord and commanders of Twitch and streaming. Yea, right. El oh el."
redditblack,3d4qiv,realbynight,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:06 2015 UTC,can I ask which mods help his stream?
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-3,Mon Jul 13 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"I mean...is this a real question? Or are you saying that because he is not a mod anymore? Doesn't make a difference, but I guess we can say it does if it makes everyone feel better. I mean... Apologician even shouted him out in his deleted 1k follower post not hardly a day after Dan went in and bashed my stream to Hirez....."
redditblack,3d4qiv,Half,3,Mon Jul 13 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"Like this is a real question because if you are talking about Dan he hasnt been a mod or a member for 3 weeks.  So yeah it does make a difference because all of the stuff with him and you happened recently. So when you are calling out mods for favoritism and the person you call out isnt a mod or member anymore yes it 100% does make a difference.  The mods support all streams, and i do believe I offered to tweet out your channel from the official rblk account if you wanted."
redditblack,3d4qiv,realbynight,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"You did. He has been in Apologician's stream for several weeks, and he has made comments about mine for as long. This isn't the first issue, just the only one that has been a big enough deal for me to call out."
redditblack,3d4qiv,Apologician,3,Mon Jul 13 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"I've been in Apolos stream for several weeks because he's one of the people that I play Smite with on a regular basis. When I was on the COD grind I was in Grants stream almost every time he streamed, hell I watched him play Runescape for far too long to support him. If you do it right I have no problem supporting the members here in their stream efforts. I've been in Dev's, Geoff, Teddys, and whoever else was streaming to support them because they are doing things the right way.   I've made comments about your stream for weeks? The other day is the first comment I've made in your stream or to anyone else because I'm never in your stream. Getting exposure for cheating the system is bs and you deserved to be called out."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, however til this moment we had no clue about all of these past issues."

I have only been in your stream a few times and have probably on said a few words, if that. So that there is a flat out lie. Just stop with this shit, it's supposed to be done and over with."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"I mean, you have. You have come in twice. Once you told me to turn my stupid *** music off because no one wanted to hear the Smite stuff, and the second you said nothing but criticized my Thor build. I have watched your stream and never been negative toward you because I honestly hoped you would make it. As I should. I have no ill will or intent. I want you to be successful if it is what you want. But everyone seems to think I shouldn't be. It is ridiculous."
redditblack,3d4qiv,Apologician,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:53:27 2015 UTC,Okay so I told you to turn off the Kawaii Pop music because it's annoying and I know from my stream majority of people don't want to hear that shot constantly so there I tried to help and then I made a suggestion on how to make your in game build for a god better so you can do better? Most people would see that as trying to help or give advice but take it as you will. I'm done with this petty shit.
redditblack,3d4qiv,tommynottom,-6,Mon Jul 13 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, you come into my channel, say nothing but ""turn that ****ing music off, no one wants to hear it"" and then leave. Next you tell me my build is wrong and nothing else. The only two sentences you have ever typed in my chat. Pretty negative. Honestly dude, I DGAF. I'll tell you like I told Caddy and everyone else. There is plenty of room on Twitch. Good luck to you and yours, but if anyone wants to hate on my channel, just stay the eff away from it.  This is pretty sad to see some of the responses that have come out of this. So much hate for something that literally no one is even affected by. SMH"
redditblack,3d4qiv,dRwEedThuMb,2,Mon Jul 13 19:06:02 2015 UTC,Just to blanket cover why I thanked Nabby. He has been in my stream since day 1 and helped moderate it and keep the chat straight. He is in there almost every time I stream. He helps my chat and has even offered to send my his ElGato that is just sitting in a box at his house. So yeah he has helped me more than anyone else has. Now thats not bash anyone but its just being honest. All the shit between you and him is between you and him. I didnt know anything about it until today. It didn't matter who helped me like he has I was going to give them credit. It doesnt matter that he was a mod a while ago. We play SMITE together so of course he would be there.
redditblack,3d4qiv,tommynottom,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, Apologician is growing his channel legitimately by consistently doing giveaways. Even if he is viewbotting, he's not doing it as blatantly as you are. I'm not ""sipping on haterade"" as you immaturely put it, but I'm just astounded by how you don't realize what your doing is not going to make yourself grow on Twitch. Although I'm fairly new to the whole streaming scene, I've learned from the past few weeks that streaming is fucking hard work. Creating a channel and building a brand legitimately takes serious consistent grinding and personality, none which I have seen a glimmer of while watching your channel.   I'm sorry I had to call you out in this manner, and I will not engage this argument further as I somewhat agree with certain arguments you made (not regarding your Twitch channel), but the fact that you haven't expressed an ounce of humility is just infuriating."

But I like how he contradicts himself by saying the mods need to shut the GroupMe down but then goes onto say that the mods aren't parents, or bosses, or directors.   EDIT: forgot ""presidents"""
redditblack,3d4qiv,Half,-4,Mon Jul 13 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't say shut the Groupme down. Did you even read the post? I could care less if there is a Groupme or Hipchat or whatever. I am so confused right now. Why are you even responding if you won't read?   Case in point, you all tried to say ""we will step in and shut the Groupme down.""   There you go. I said they said they would, and that isn't right. Like WTH am I even responding to right now? I mean, thanks for ""softening the blow,"" but I can assure you the nerf gun shot you took didn't have as much impact as you think. Especially since you have already shown twice in as many replies that you did not even read my post carefully."
redditblack,3d4qiv,PhiKizzle,-4,Mon Jul 13 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Don't respond, that's cool. You are not the matter of fact here. I only responded in kind. You immaturely try to put me out on blast for something I have no control over. That is sipping on haterade. Five minutes after a Dev brings people to my stream via Tweet, a tweet is sent from my own community that I am botted. That is sipping on haterade.  I have no reason to explain myself to you, but here you go. I have had giveaways and I stream literally every single day. Every. Single. Day. For 5 and 6+ hours most days. Between losing my job, having to find another, worry about my kids and try to work on this, I put as much time and money I can into it. So what makes mine less? I don't bot, but if I am getting botted, why not take advantage of it. Literally every day for 4+ hours and giveaways. You said both of the things I am not doing are why I don't deserve it, when I am streaming literally every day.  SMFH. Please do some research before you post."

redditblack,3csozt,joshlove,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:25:49 2015 UTC,Sounds good I'll look those up. Food wise I am a fan of Italian and Mexican. I feel like I should try some NY thin crust pizza before I leave too.

Dos caminos , salvation taco are two good choices though. Italian little Italy is always a good, and eataly too (plus nutella bar is a bonus )"

The little gaming time I've had has been mostly spent on playing through the Halo campaigns on MCC which has been fun. It's pretty cool switching between the original and remastered textures. I've finished Halo 1 and 2 and I'm now on ODST which I'd never played before. Next is Halo 3 and then Halo 4 which I've never played before too.  I went whale watching on Monday, that was pretty boring. 5 hours and no humpbacks, just a few little whales that popped out of the water for a half second.  I'm getting really fucking annoyed at our home builder...we agreed on an offer way back in March, with the expectation it would be complete in September. They didn't have the contract ready until May, which we signed. They have still not even started construction and now it is pushed back to October 31st. At the current rate of progress I have doubts it'll be done by November and I really don't want to friggin move in the Winter."

This is the prodigy (formerly known as the demon spawn) at his new battlestation. My son turned 11 on Wednesday. I made him a deal late last year, if he did well in school and was able to save half the cost, I would put up the other half and get him his own X1. Well, he held up his end of the bargain, and so did I.  I finally picked up a ""gaming monitor"", I ended up getting a Samsung 24"" LED monitor with 3ms response time. I hopped onto AW to test it out, the results were...noticeable. It is so much more responsive. This will be my battlestation for the upcoming Clam Wars in BO3. I can't fucking wait.  One of the biggest highlights of my week, was finally being able to play Destiny with my son. He's been playing Destiny on my old 360 since Christmas. We're always talking about different things in the game..what's Xur selling this week? what did you get from the Nightfall etc. Well, yesterday we finally got to play together. It. Was. Fucking. Awesome. He is remarkably good at Destiny..and apparently AW as well. He played his first round of AW this morning...20-5...first game of MP.  TL;DR Wall of text but...awesome week. My son has ascended to the X1. Got a gaming monitor. Life is good."

I haven't played an online match yet and I'm real curious to see how we stack up.  The entire concept of the game is so simple yet the skill gap is pretty evident. It's nice to see a game that's simple and doesn't try to do too many things.

redditblack,3ctj0d,bbiyf,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:04:29 2015 UTC,I'd agree.  Halo CE for being so... amazing at a time when there wasn't anything close to what it brought.  Halo 2 for the freedom to explore and do ANYTHING throughout that campaign.  Halo 3 for the awesome co-op moments that brought laughs.  Halo 4... meh?
redditblack,3ctj0d,aariakon,2,Sat Jul 11 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Playing halo lately has made me miss how simple multiplayer used to be. The maps used to be clear and somewhat balanced if not mirrored... There wasn't all this extra clutter just to show off how cool your graphic engine is. It was clear, enemies were visible and it took a lot more skill and tactics.   Nowadays maps are a cluster fuck of random objects and a shit ton of extra things thrown that really seem unnecessary imo."

I've read that going from 360 to X1, Destiny characters will carry over (he has 3 lvl 34 guardians) but the dlc (that I've already purchased for both gt's) doesn't carry over. So will the console sharing allow him to access the X1 Destiny dlc I've already purchased?"

The gamertag you buy it on IS important.

redditblack,3cl1zh,RabidGrinch,3,Wed Jul 8 19:09:23 2015 UTC,What do you plan on using it for? I was looking into buying one and using it as a TV box but instead I purchased an android stick and loaded it up with XBMC and a bunch of other stuff. The good thing is it comes with a lot of stuff out of the box so it's relatively painless to configure.
redditblack,3cl1zh,zpoon,2,Wed Jul 8 20:06:33 2015 UTC,I've been on the fence of getting a few to build a mini cluster with  but I've just been too busy with other projects. I also just hopped back on the Destiny grind...  What are you thinking about using it for?
redditblack,3cl1zh,TheMiamiWhale,2,Wed Jul 8 20:01:20 2015 UTC,/u/zpoon /u/TheMiamiWhale Thanks guys!  I was mainly thinking of using it for TV for now. The apartment I am living in has like 3 channels and 2 of them are hunting channels haha I'll take a look at that android stick. Will it work with a MBP though?
redditblack,3cl1zh,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"If you are just looking for a way to watch TV via the internet, I highly recommend an Apple TV. It is by far the best purchase I've made in a long time. We get everything we need with Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. If there happens to be something we can't get, we just buy the season on iTunes. The only disadvantage is you can't access NAS to stream any of your downloaded movies. It's a little more expensive than a Raspbery Pi but is insanely easy to use and setup."
redditblack,3cl1zh,zpoon,3,Wed Jul 8 22:06:10 2015 UTC,If you've already got a good iTunes library then I agree Apple TV is definitely the way to go. I would never purchase it though due to lack of support with DLNA/NAS or XBMC streaming but that's just me.
redditblack,3cl1zh,tdvx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:56 2015 UTC,been dying for an ATV refresh for years to include DLNA.  i'd get a gen2 ATV and jailbreak it but the lack of 1080p is sad.

redditblack,3cl1zh,Prodeje79,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:46 2015 UTC,I'd also like to clarify what how you want to use it....  Basically will you stream off the internet like Netflix or just access your library of files off of a network drive.  You can run a slick Sabnzb/Sickbeard DVR setup off of a windows PC or Synology NAS.  I currently have 3 WDTV Live boxes that access my Synology NAS....

redditblack,3cl1zh,zpoon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"I used to be a packrat when it came to stuff like that. I had a NAS and just streamed movies with Popcorn Hour but I couldn't really keep up with the storage requirements. I was downloading BRrips in the GBs and I would find it filling up fast.  I then just decided to buy an Android box and stream everything with Kodi and Genesis. Streaming's got to the point where you can reliably stream HD if your internet can handle it with not too many issues. Easier than downloading, transferring to your NAS etc. The Android box has also worked really well when I can put up Twitch or MLG streams though the app. Of course you might lose the quality you get from a local BRrip it's bearable imo."
redditblack,3cl1zh,BIacked0ut,2,Wed Jul 8 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"The synology box basically has the programs to DL on the box so no moving required, then I would either stream with DLNA to my TV or run Plex. I slapped 4x2TB drives in it so 8 TB total. I love it just for getting entire seasons of tv shows and bingeing.    All tv shows that I already own on DVD of course."
redditblack,3cl1zh,Prodeje79,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:57:53 2015 UTC,My WDTV Live boxes seem to be dying.  I like how they play about everything just over the network share drive.

redditblack,3c8zek,royalBASSmaster,5,Mon Jul 6 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"My probably unpopular opinion is it looks like it'll be fun and better than both AW and Ghosts.  I watched the Driftor gameplay, and yea the supers are a little troubling to see, but the main thing is I don't see Ace Combat gunfights or shitty Ghosts-esque maps.  I look forward to squadding up release night with you guys and putting people in the dirt."
redditblack,3c8zek,bbiyf,2,Mon Jul 6 03:40:54 2015 UTC,I primarily watched his gameplay as well. The movement looks so smooth. Very Titanfall-esque.
redditblack,3c8zek,dRwEedThuMb,2,Mon Jul 6 03:55:57 2015 UTC,"He mentioned something along the lines of a perk where you can see footsteps. Fuck is that all about? Either way, I'll be on release night playing all night through the day.  Not sure about others but I'm pretty excited about Star Wars: Battlefront"
redditblack,3c8zek,LackingAGoodName,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:36:46 2015 UTC,Yeah Battlefront looks amazing. Was nerdin out really hard when they showed the first gameplay of it. Hopefully we have a dedicated group on that game as well.
redditblack,3c8zek,ParlHillAddict,4,Mon Jul 6 05:43:50 2015 UTC,"You mean... Black Ops 3?  Looks really fun, I'm going to save my opinion for the Beta, though."
redditblack,3c8zek,MeGustaTortugas,2,Mon Jul 6 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"I'm still worried that the extra movement mechanics + unlimited sprint will lead to the same wonky spawns and easily flanked positions we saw in AW.  I'm not a big fan of the Specialists. At least it isn't as bad as Destiny, where their supers have invincibility frames, extra health, instant-use (Titan smash), etc. Ideally, most people will use the more powerful weapons, get an extra kill or two (which they might have done anyway with regular guns), then get killed. The non-weapon abilities are a bit more concerning, especially if they'll all be allowed in League Play. But overall, most players won't be able to take too much advantage of them. Again, many of Destiny's supers were easy to use (Bladedancer = spam the melee button), but BO3 will be more about one-time tactical advantages, and can easily be wasted. I'll see how it goes in the beta, but hopefully some of the abilities have shorter timers before deactivating."
redditblack,3c8zek,8306623863,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"On the first part, unlimited sprint doesn't ruin battlefield games, it's silly that it didn't hit without a perk until AW. Keep in mind in BO3 though, there's no lightweight perk, so Unlimited Sprint will still be bound by the weapon you're carrying."
redditblack,3c8zek,martinottionice,2,Mon Jul 6 01:25:04 2015 UTC,I mean the battlefield maps are fucking huge so unlimited sprint really doesn't do much for it.
redditblack,3c8zek,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:30:00 2015 UTC,"I'll be interested to see how they design the maps because of this. Unlimited sprint has been totally fine in Blops, MW2, and Ghosts partially because the maps have been appropriately sized. If the AW maps were larger then it would have solved many of the big spawn and objective problems."
redditblack,3c8zek,007chill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"Though the key difference in AW and BO3 is unlimited sprint for everyone by default. Sure, you could do unlimited sprint in MW2, but that was in a perk category that also contained Sleight of Hand (the Pro version of the perk gave you Quickdraw too), Scavenger and Bling. This made it so that a rushing class had to sacrifice faster reloading or resupplying to get unlimited sprint (not to mention sacrificing Stopping Power if you wanted Lightweight). The maps were able to handle unlimited sprint because usually a few players in a match actually used it, not to mention the constant need to stop at corners, ladders, mantling over barriers, etc.  We'll see if BO3's maps put up enough ""speedbumps"" to keep people from traversing the map as easily and fast as they did in AW."

I started playing call of duty when cod4c came out, I did play the other ones but I stared playing seriously when cod 4 came out. And I have bought every single cod ever since.

The #1 thing you need to do (IMO) is make sure you get a load of games in with quite a few members, especially the Mods. Get to know the people here, get a good feel of the community here before you instantly decide you want in. I think I speak for other people when I say, rBLK is a long-term kind of thing, it isn't something where you just come and go as you please.  My application process took about 2 weeks, but that was because I tried my hardest to communicate with as many members as I could, I made myself somewhat known in the community. Not to mention I made a realllllllyyy long application. Now, to be honest with you, your Application process is going to take longer. You're a new Reddit user which is kind of a bad thing, like /u/realbynight said.  Stick around the Subreddit, play with Members, get to know people, who know's you could be the next Recruit!

Anyone have any insight into why this could be?  My wife's bday was in May, and I got her a gift certificate for a tattoo shop that a buddy owns. Well it took a little time, but she got it yesterday and it's bad ass (she got Mjolnir aka Thor's hammer, on her wrist).

redditblack,3bks2n,HostileHokie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:08:18 2015 UTC,I still wanna go back and play some more. Just been on that Batman grind. Only complaint about The Witcher is that I felt like I didn't fight many monsters as a monster hunter. The Battle of Kaer Mohen was fun though.
redditblack,3bks2n,HostileHokie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:51 2015 UTC,The developer has already mentioned that they will be releasing two sizeable DLC's. Sizeable by their standards means it's going to be pretty fucking big.   I also have no clue what the DLC's could be about but my guess will be it'll have a lot more monster focused quests now that the Wild Hunt is done.
redditblack,3bks2n,sigmamu232,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:46:51 2015 UTC,Nice. I liked that they give free weekly DLC also. Wasn't anything game changing like haircuts and armor but it's still nice when you see developers doing this.

Crap like that.  He is worried about some specialists but at the same token, he really likes others.  He likes the hit detection, similar to Blops2.   Even some things he put in ""the ugly"" section he actually liked but was trying to appeal to the general public opinion.

Titanfall's movement never bothered me, and the similarities between BO3 and TF movements are pretty obvious. All in all, I'm looking forward to this game."

redditblack,3b6whk,tastywatermelon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"I'm a conservative driver so I don't need a lot of HP. More space the better since I'm over 6feet tall.   As for price, I really don't know how to judge something like that. Originally, I was thinking around the 18k mark but if I'm able to secure a good rate, I could probably go up around 25k. I don't know what's the recommendation of price of a car to income ratio."
redditblack,3b6whk,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"Ford Focus. I've sold close to 60 of the new (2012+) body style cars, and I'm a huge fan of them. I took one home one night when I last worked for a Ford dealer, cruise control @70mph, 90 mile round trip..42.5 avg mpg. In addition, Sync (Bluetooth, Voice activation etc.)works much better than the system Chevy uses. Don't get me wrong, the Chevy Cruze is a very nice car, I think the Focus is slightly better."

Rock climbing, tubing, reaching down to pick something up, and (most embarrassing) when my wife startled me and it popped out. Smfh."

redditblack,3b6whk,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:26:04 2015 UTC,I think they told me either something happened or I was born without a portion of the labrum. That makes it so the shoulder can come out with little to no effort or force. Just hits the wrong angle and pop.

redditblack,3b6whk,eSchiro,2,Mon Jun 29 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they essentially rebuild it so it's about 80% of what it was. The surgery is also minimally invasive. I wanted it, but my doctor was a jackass. In my case, it worked out. I do all kinds of shit with it, but I can no longer play soccer, it hurts when I sleep on it for a while, and doing 'arm circles' for shoulder warm ups and that jazz causes it to click/pop every rotation.

I'm still working my way through The Witcher and now there's Batman so a lot of my gaming time has been spent there as of late.   I'm still around Ps4bros.

That being said that does not mean mod work comes to a halt, we will still be trying to get tourneys going for games, community nights, CSS cranked out and prepping for BO3 and beyond.    Take this time to get to know your clan mates, branch out from the same people youve been playin with, hit up some other games, and have fun. Halo BO2 smite LoL CS GO, just play something with our guys. Keep that xbox aim up cause come BO3 we fire up the submarine again like we have done for the last 5+ years."

redditblack,3arnbs,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"These guys used to work for the videogame site GamesRadar (as well as working for some game companies), and have been doing these shows on their own for years (several of their shows have 100+ episodes). They already have shows on comics, video games, and wrestling, but their flagship show is a random weekly look at the kind of pop culture lots of us grew up with. One of their recent shows was about gross toys from the 80's/90's. They are pretty damn funny, and mix in audio clips and sound effects well.  I supported them right away. 4 podcasts a week, plus their stretch goal of a Simpsons podcast, and their additional video and site content, made it an easy sell."
redditblack,3ardfn,xmeds08,2,Mon Jun 22 22:01:59 2015 UTC,"The fact that they disabled parties and playing with your friends killed it for me.  The original GoW maps were not made for respawn game modes. Tdm is awful in the GoW setting.  The Longshot is built for how it was in GoW 2/3, that needs to change. They need to make how it was in the original game, the weapon already takes a huge amount of skill to use. Putting the reticle back to the original will not break the game.  Active Reloads to be untouched. They were a huge part of the original game and need to stay that way. Getting active downed by the Longshot sucks, but it's part of the game. Adapt and become a better player.  The Smoke Grenades do not stun and you can't wall tag. This good and the game needs to stay that way.  The Gnasher is broken. The hit registration is off and they need to move the shots back to coming out the center of screen.  The spotting needs to go.  Footsteps are quite as fuck. They need to make them just as loud as they were in the original.    I love the original Gears Of War, it's the game I played while everyone else was playing CoD4. However, this Gears of War remake with huge elements of Gears 2/3 are not needed. Just give us the original Gears please. Fuck I won't even buy this new Ultimate Edition if they just make the first backwards compatible. Just my thoughts and opinions."

If I'm trying to ""spice it up"" why don't I just change it to allow a QB for FLEX and 6 point for all passing TDS and 2 point PPR? There's a line that has to be drawn and some people just prefer standard leagues. When you add the PPR element everything changes, especially draft strats and it instantly makes WR most valuable.

I'd agree with you it takes some getting used to - it isn't necessarily straight forward on what to do next. I typically find the next set of quests based on where I haven't explored yet. Once you get through the first couple of areas the quests start to chain together much better.   I've really enjoyed the main story, mage guild and fighters guild questlines and then usually each zone has at least one major questline that has a real good story to it. So far the Rivenspire area has been my favorite. I'm almost done with the last Daggerfall Covenant zone and then I get to venture into the other factions stories."

redditblack,3aepw9,sigmamu232,2,Sat Jun 20 01:12:17 2015 UTC,I actually really enjoyed Jurassic World - it gave me that same kind of feeling when I saw the original Jurassic Park as a kid.  Sherlock Holmes is great. I agree with you I had no idea when I first started watching that the episodes were 1.5 hours long. It's like when you put on a show and don't realize its the 2hour season finale. Whats cool though is its only 3 episodes per season - it's not like trying to catch up with 24 which is like 9 seasons and 24 hours per season.

redditblack,3affmg,YeahMann,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:29:17 2015 UTC,Ijust started with no nicotine. The flavor I love the most is Space Jame Pluto. It taste just like a Watermelon Warhead.

So that is a good way to go."
redditblack,3affmg,joshlove,2,Fri Jun 19 20:07:23 2015 UTC,Honest question for someone who doesn't smoke - what would vaping do for you if you don't smoke? Is it mostly a flavor or comfort thing?
redditblack,3affmg,YeahMann,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:11:28 2015 UTC,Some people just like the feeling of smoking but don't want to smoke cigarettes. It's like chewing bubblegum that doesn't lose its flavor.
redditblack,3affmg,S4R_ben,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:28:58 2015 UTC,"People vape for many reasons. To stop food cravings throughout the day, stress relief, as an alternative to hookah or marijuana."
redditblack,3affmg,S4R_ben,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:44:16 2015 UTC,"I just picked up a Kanger Sub Box starter kit, came with the 50w Kbox w/led screen and the Sub tank mini for $60 shipped. I like the tank a lot, best airflow I've found in a tank. The Kbox is a battery assassin, I get about an hour of vaping out of an 18650 full charge, running at 50w. Going to give the kbox to the wife, going to keep the Sub tank for me."
redditblack,3affmg,dRwEedThuMb,2,Fri Jun 19 21:26:48 2015 UTC,Yea the new box in that kit has low voltage protection. It gives real time battery consumption on the screen depending on what watts you are vaping at. This keeps people from over stressing the battery. This is going to be more common with high wattage single 18650 batteries since the amp limit is fairly low.
redditblack,3affmg,YeahMann,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"Makes sense. I bought it as a ""traveling"" vape. As you well know, dripping and driving is a fucking pain. I'm probably just going to run that Subtank on my Sig 150w. The .5 ohm coils on that Subtank are actually really good for ""factory"" coils. I tried out the rba head for it, but can't seem to wick it so it won't dry hit. Practice makes perfect."
redditblack,3affmg,HawtTomole,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"Also to add to what I said, if the wife plans on using the lower power settings (less than 30 watts) it actually gets really good battery life. The nice thing is that it is super easy to swap batteries if you keep spares on you (I always have at least 2 fully charged 35amp Efest 18650's in my pocket)"
redditblack,3affmg,YeahMann,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:28:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm in same boat. Special had actually sent me a detailed PM awhile back on a good beginner kit.  But then I just think I'll stick with cannabis. Does everything I want.
redditblack,3affmg,HawtTomole,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:09:12 2015 UTC,I usually stick with weed too but vaping intrigues me. I've tried it before and it's so nice to get huge hits of awesome tasting flavors.. especially when you're blazed

redditblack,3affmg,PurpKiD,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:48:33 2015 UTC,You should try our Kandy Krush for a sweet flavor and our Green Apple for a fruit flavor. Get the ones in the original collection and not the High Density. High Density would be too thick for that tank. Those are our number 1 and 2 best sellers in my store and are very tasty.

redditblack,3aejjh,MRbraneSIC,0,Fri Jun 19 16:53:16 2015 UTC,xbox elite controller offers remapping without software delays since it remaps on the controller itself.
redditblack,3aejjh,amt_airb0rne,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:58:40 2015 UTC,What software delay?
redditblack,3aejjh,MRbraneSIC,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:59:07 2015 UTC,I can't find it right now but I remember reading that they included button mapping that was remapped on the controller to avoid the software delays that are in the software of other remappable hardware (you press 'b' but you remapped it to 'y'...this means the controller sends 'b' but the xbox has to switch the input to 'y' before sending it to the game...instead the remapping means that 'b' = 'y' in the elite controller)
redditblack,3aejjh,amt_airb0rne,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:46:24 2015 UTC,"Ah - there's no such delay for me, I have RB set as my jump button on my regular Xbox controller."

redditblack,3a7df8,Feeceez,2,Thu Jun 18 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"Eh, maybe. I don't ever really Stream to get Viewers, I just use it as more of a Personal Recording Service, if I have a good game or something, I can go back and save it on my computer."
redditblack,3a8g20,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"Objectively, this DLC was great. Lots of added content, they reduced the grind to tolerable levels, tons of stuff to do every week. Bungie has been listening to the community, and every patch they release improves the game immensely. If anyone enjoys Destiny at all I'd recommend picking it up. That being said, I personally have no urge to play it anymore.   I'm burned out on Destiny. Maybe I played too much in the beginning, thanks to AW being shit and the One having a lack of interesting titles, but it's definitely happened. I'll be getting the Taken King, but whether I'll invest time into it depends on how much they actually add."
redditblack,3a8g20,fawse,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:27:28 2015 UTC,"Interesting post. Makes me want to get back in and try the new DLC out. Undecided about the Taken King at the moment though. I got pretty burnt out on Destiny as well, especially the grind, but sounds like that is fixed now.  I tried playing some PvP the other day and got absolutely destroyed. Needless to say, I didn't stay on too long..."
redditblack,3a8g20,TheMiamiWhale,2,Thu Jun 18 12:48:50 2015 UTC,Pvp is fun I like the new stuff for it but its a must to play with friends on ib or too not randoms
redditblack,3a8g20,StewBeer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:39:14 2015 UTC,I personally don't like that there's no matchmaking for ToO but I understand why they did it that way.
redditblack,3a8g20,alke-holic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"So the grind for shards isn't bad anymore?    That is the single reason I quit playing the game. Too much grind, for little in return.  Looks like I'll be playing this weekend."
redditblack,3a8g20,joshlove,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:23:03 2015 UTC,you don't really need shards anymore to level up. You can 'ascend' any legendary armor piece to the highest level light. I have a Queen's Guard Hood for my Warlock that now has 42 light.
redditblack,3a8g20,StewBeer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:52:45 2015 UTC,Destiny got on my nerves early on with the grind aspects of it. I've played some recently and it's definitely more tolerable though.
redditblack,3a8g20,RabidGrinch,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:00:44 2015 UTC,"I like the dlc. It doesn't take long however to  reach max level. Trials is fun, I wish there was a little more going on but I guess that's what the next dlc is for"
redditblack,3a8g20,Corvese,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"New DLC was fun. One of the more underrated parts (yes I saw this on the Destiny sub but had to try for myself) is to pull out your Queensbreaker Bow, go to the Divide, stand on that building in the middle where the Vandals shoot from, and shoot at unexpecting guardians and watch them run for cover! It's quite entertaining for a few minutes."
redditblack,3a8g20,PurpKiD,2,Thu Jun 18 17:19:54 2015 UTC,I wish I had that sniper. I was playing with a friend that had one and he kept no-scoping plebs like a boss.
redditblack,3a8g20,S4R_ben,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:53:29 2015 UTC,"Destiny is a game that I played a shit load of at the start, but fell off the wagon hard. I feel like I did everything possible in the Vanilla version of the game, and I played it so much that I got really burnt out. So much so that even when the DLCs came out, I still didn't really have a interest on going through them.  Still though, I think destiny is a great game."

redditblack,3a7onf,AphoticAffinity,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:34:03 2015 UTC,I loved Invasion! I know it wasnt the most popular game mode but I loved the feel of large scale warfare.
redditblack,3a7onf,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:07:13 2015 UTC,Looks interesting but probably won't be the main appeal of the game for me.

redditblack,3a510n,TheMiamiWhale,3,Wed Jun 17 16:43:49 2015 UTC,It's a great show. You are getting in at a good time too because you have a bunch of seasons to still watch (although I have a feeling you'll finish them in no time..).  I'm a fan of Jaimie as well. He has is asshole moments but I think under it all he's a good guy and values his family. Season 5 was a little slow for my taste but I'm interested to see where things go in seasons 6 and 7... shit is getting nuts!
redditblack,3a510n,sauce687,4,Wed Jun 17 12:39:01 2015 UTC,You know nothing T Process.

redditblack,3a510n,joshlove,2,Wed Jun 17 11:32:47 2015 UTC,"Also - If you like the show, you should check out the books. Some changes are huge between them."

redditblack,3a3ms1,SVT-Cobra,5,Tue Jun 16 23:39:08 2015 UTC,At 4:22 I can't tell for sure if he connects with the butt stroke. It seems like he does and it doesn't result in instant death. Could this be the end of panic knife?! I would be so happy..
redditblack,3a3ms1,Meathead_shit,7,Wed Jun 17 00:49:53 2015 UTC,"It is. Melee is no longer one hit kill, which is great news for non-stop rushers or for those who play on a tactical layout!"
redditblack,3a3ms1,007chill,5,Wed Jun 17 01:34:48 2015 UTC,I can't even explain how excited I am about this.
redditblack,3a3ms1,tdvx,2,Wed Jun 17 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"it is sometimes. melee dealt is equal to your current health. so you can 1 hit melee if you're undamaged.  i lied. damage dealt is 50-60 damage, and you hit them with your gun. so it takes 2 hits. you can 1 hit melee them if you're running the combat knife (no weapon equipped), and maybe hitting them with your gun if you hit them in the back or they're laying prone.  melee system vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_vii5lmq50  this basically eliminates the knife through bullets shit."
redditblack,3a3ms1,Meathead_shit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:04:47 2015 UTC,"Here you go /u/Meathead_shit , here's the skinny apparently. Sounds pretty cool, but I'm wondering how this will work with lag."
redditblack,3a3ms1,sigmamu232,2,Wed Jun 17 03:59:18 2015 UTC,Hey at least it's better then what we have now.
redditblack,3a3ms1,eSchiro,2,Wed Jun 17 10:28:29 2015 UTC,There is nothing more I want in this world than the removal of panic knifing.
redditblack,3a3ms1,NotEthosLab,3,Wed Jun 17 23:10:57 2015 UTC,VERY reminiscent of BO2 to me. The movement doesn't look like AW at all. Mostly ground combat and slower paced. It doesn't look like you'll be able to dash across the map very quickly.
redditblack,3a3ms1,S4R_ben,3,Wed Jun 17 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"I have faith that this game will be fun, Treyarch has proven that they know what they're doing. Whether they keep my faith for future games after this game remains to be seen, but as of now I'm really excited."
redditblack,3a3ms1,TheMiamiWhale,2,Wed Jun 17 01:56:48 2015 UTC,"This looks pretty good, it's definitely not the ADHD combat of AW. Wall running and double jump = :/  I like what I've seen so far."
redditblack,3a3ms1,dRwEedThuMb,3,Wed Jun 17 01:16:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Gameplay looks more fun than I had originally anticipated. I'm not as worried about the wall running, it seemed to me it was more of a gimmick than anything else."
redditblack,3a3ms1,TSHIRTTIIIIIIME,2,Wed Jun 17 10:41:40 2015 UTC,"They look pretty tame, but I'm worried that the double jump and wall run will make map control pretty hard due to the amount of options it adds for flanking. I think they should slow that double jump down even more, too!"
redditblack,3a3ms1,Elaborateshoe3,2,Wed Jun 17 01:38:39 2015 UTC,This looked pretty fun surprisingly.
redditblack,3a3ms1,PurpKiD,2,Wed Jun 17 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pumped. I have 25+ days played on BO1 and BO2 each and a good amount of WaW (don't remember how much at this point, played on a different GT back then too). I always enjoyed Treyarch's games the most. Nothing in this video is changing my mind about that"
redditblack,3a3ms1,boots4210,2,Wed Jun 17 01:54:33 2015 UTC,Makes me want to play it now that I know you can't dash behind poeple when being shot at.
redditblack,3a3ms1,zpoon,2,Wed Jun 17 10:35:52 2015 UTC,My body is ready.
redditblack,3a3ms1,DevmasterJ,2,Wed Jun 17 12:24:55 2015 UTC,I'm trying not to get my hopes up after the disappointment of AW but I do like treyarch games.  I'm not sure how I feel about the destiny-like supers but as long as they're balanced it should be fine.
redditblack,3a3ms1,TimeverseTheory,2,Wed Jun 17 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"After watching the reveal I was scared a bit, thinking it would be very AWish, but after seeing this....holy crap it's BO2 on steroids. That's goooooood. I'm excited."

redditblack,3a3ms1,xNerfed,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:56:55 2015 UTC,I feel like this should have been released then Advanced Warfare
redditblack,3a3ms1,ITK_REPEATEDLY,0,Wed Jun 17 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"the double jump looks alright but the wallrunning is really bugging me for some reason :/ The double jump seems to me like it's a smoother jump + mantle, and not really something you'd use as a double jump to go places or evade bullets.  more wallhacks :/ idk why they keep putting this shit in.  i love how the medals stack in the top of the screen so you dont have medals popping up for 5 minutes after a solid string of capture kills."
redditblack,3a3ms1,xNerfed,0,Tue Jun 16 23:58:10 2015 UTC,hit detection actually looks good.
redditblack,3a3ms1,tdvx,10,Wed Jun 17 01:04:49 2015 UTC,That's because it's LAN gameplay

redditblack,3a19ph,Corvese,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"I'm still waiting for any kind of FFVI remake. FFIII and FFIV both got remakes on the DS. The best FFVI got was a cringe-inducing port for phones. You'd think that the style of the game (which, in retrospect, is pretty steampunk) would be popular even with people who didn't play the game originally.  Still, I'm also excited about this. Going back to FFVII now, and you can really notice that it was the first FF game to use polygons, FMV, etc., as it's not the most well-made game. People remember the detailed characters in cutscenes and combat, but when you walk around the map, you're a blocky chibi."
redditblack,3a19ph,Warbugg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:57:57 2015 UTC,FF7 is the game that got me into gaming as a kid. Oh the nostalgia..
redditblack,3a19ph,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:05:00 2015 UTC,Exactly why I have wanted this so badly. It set such a high standard in terms of story for all following games. I feel like it helped shape the landscape of cinematic/story gaming.

redditblack,39zvh6,joshlove,2,Tue Jun 16 12:45:54 2015 UTC,I actually enjoyed Ghosts because the hit detection was spot on and the lack of lag comp.  Maps for me are forgettable in most games anyway.  Some of my favorite cod moments were playing SnR with the 360 guys last summer.
redditblack,39zvh6,sauce687,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:49:02 2015 UTC,"360 ghosts and XB1 ghosts are two different games in some regards, IMO.

redditblack,39zvh6,goOutSide,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:16:10 2015 UTC,I agree partially.  But at the very least it doesn't look so spastic. And the chaining doesn't seem to be as obnoxious.

redditblack,39zvh6,S4R_ben,2,Tue Jun 16 15:06:47 2015 UTC,Yea that's a good point actually. The gunplay and movement were definitely smooth and didn't really feel gimmicky.

redditblack,39zvh6,YeahMann,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:23:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone freaking out about TTK need to realize that they lower it to about 50% for the trailers. It makes gameplay look more fast paced when they get a triple kill with 5 bullets etc. Just look at the trailer for BO2.. we know how TTK was in that game, but in the trailer it looks exactly like it does here."

redditblack,39zmy1,Corvese,5,Tue Jun 16 02:20:48 2015 UTC,All I have to say is everyone in this clan that is freaking out about the competitive switch is blowing it way out of proportion. It's ridiculous.  Everyone in here plays the free GB ladders... How does that affect you whatsoever that competitive for LAN events are going to PS4?  No one in this clan (that I'm aware of) plays respawn and is trying to go pro.   It could suck for other people but those of us in here personally complaining. Chill out. jfc  I'd also like to add that it's 6 months into the game and pretty much everyone has already quit. Why does DLC early even matter if you aren't going to play it?
redditblack,39zmy1,007chill,3,Tue Jun 16 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with all of those.  As for your last point, the hope is that BO3 can hold our attention like BO2 did, which all (at least most) of us played until the very end.  Also, Treyarch zombies. I'm pretty salty about having to wait a month for the zombie maps too."

redditblack,39zmy1,Tjacks12,2,Tue Jun 16 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"From a comment in /r/CoDCompetitive   Blops 3 - $60  DLC - $45-60  Scuf - $150  PS4 - $400  Creating a huge new barrier for old and new players alike to play competitive CoD, all while CoD viewership and player base is declining...priceless"
redditblack,39zmy1,tmacsmith33,2,Tue Jun 16 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that most competitive play is only on maps that came with the game, not dlc. Is this true? Cuz then I don't see many competitive players switching because of exclusivity."
redditblack,39zmy1,MRbraneSIC,2,Tue Jun 16 02:31:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, they're getting maps sooner. which is silly (always thought it was dumb to stagger releases per console) but i dont see how this would draw much from MLG..."
redditblack,39zmy1,tdvx,2,Tue Jun 16 02:58:54 2015 UTC,The only issue would be developer pressured maps. Like that Ski Resort one in AW. If they want to showcase DLC on their biggest stage availability will become an issue.
redditblack,39zmy1,tdvx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:19:11 2015 UTC,i never knew MLG to pick maps based on developer pressure. interesting.
redditblack,39zmy1,YeahMann,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"Pros wanted DLC in rotation, ATT: Rotation was stale in their opinion. I think they flew out Nadeshot and a few others to test out DLC as an option. A mix of pro pressure and developer assistance."
redditblack,39zmy1,Corvese,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:29:06 2015 UTC,They have to because MLG will always be with the side that is partnered with Activision.
redditblack,39zmy1,tdvx,2,Tue Jun 16 03:07:58 2015 UTC,Not necessarily true. Competitive CoD was on ps3 during BO1.
redditblack,39zmy1,YeahMann,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:24:09 2015 UTC,why is that?
redditblack,39zmy1,tdvx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"Main reason is Activision knows that a fair bit of CoD publicity is competitive, so they want to be showing off the console they partnered with, another is champs ($1Mil tourney) is 100% funded by Activision, and they won't fund it unless they're using the console they partnered with."
redditblack,39zmy1,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"just seems odd to me idk.  cod champs is not mlg though, mlg really has no allegiance to any publisher afaik. also they use PCs with xbox controllers there. i mean?"
redditblack,39zmy1,tdvx,2,Tue Jun 16 03:26:01 2015 UTC,Activision has partnered with PS.  There's no way Champs won't be played on the PS.
redditblack,39zmy1,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:23:09 2015 UTC,"Well yeah but what had that got to do with MLG, who just partnered with Microsoft a month ago?"
redditblack,39zmy1,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:54:20 2015 UTC,"Good question, but they don't run champs.  I don't know how that's going to work."
redditblack,39zmy1,YeahMann,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"I guess since MLG has always been Xbox, I just assumed because it was the better console (360 vs PS3). It seems like a major and unnecessary change to switch over to PS4 just because of some deal between Sony and Activision. IMO, I think they'll stay with Xbox because Sony has had too much of a bad track record with getting hacked (DDoS is NOT hacking btw and both consoles suffer from these attacks).  We'll see what happens, I guess."
redditblack,39zmy1,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Competitive used to be played on PS3 until the end of Black Ops 1, so they have made the switch before."
redditblack,39zmy1,vengefulhokie,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:23:23 2015 UTC,"yes but IIRC, the reason for the change was because PS3 was majorly hacked and people couldn't play for a month or two.  edit: here is the network outage that lasted 23 days. It happened in April 2011 which was nearing the end of Black Ops 1. I can't confirm this is the reason comp left PS3 but it's a probable theory"

Josh is a rblk homie We were able to ""barter"", benefiting both of us. Craftsmanship is top notch 50% less than a comparable Scuf (feature wise)     $150 for this Elite controller is a deal.

redditblack,39z9hf,tdvx,3,Tue Jun 16 03:18:59 2015 UTC,BF4 is a masterpiece compared to the atrocity that is Hardline.
redditblack,39z9hf,SpeclalK,2,Tue Jun 16 05:41:33 2015 UTC,I had zero care for this game until I saw that gameplay.  Looks really fun!!  Definitely on my list!

redditblack,39z5um,YeahMann,2,Mon Jun 15 23:40:41 2015 UTC,"BO2 is currently at the top of the list. I voted for BO2, COD4, MW2, and MW3."

redditblack,39z5um,HashtagDetriment,-1,Tue Jun 16 01:59:57 2015 UTC,"you realize that IF Activision agrees to let their games be backwards compatible, it wont be until this fall, probably after BO3 is released.  seems silly to vote for that."
redditblack,39z5um,tdvx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:09:46 2015 UTC,"That's assuming Microsoft didn't talk to Activision about this beforehand. I'm not saying I'm expecting anything soon, but with the information we currently have your statement is just as misinformed as someone hoping BO2, COD4, etc. comes out in the near future (however you want to define ""near"").  Anyways, I think people are voting for their favorite games on the 360, not the games they think will be out the soonest."
redditblack,39z5um,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"No the feature is preview only until this fall. that뗩 what I mean. No matter what gets voted in this feature isn뗪 going to be in full swing until it leaves beta, which is this fall."
redditblack,39z5um,tdvx,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:19:49 2015 UTC,Ah ok - I thought you were talking Activision specific. My bad
redditblack,39z5um,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:41:29 2015 UTC,my jab at activision is about them being so greedy i doubt they'd ever give the go ahead for their games to be compatible.
redditblack,39z5um,tdvx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:01:19 2015 UTC,"How does that make sense? Making their games backwards compatible would only help them sell more copies of past games, no?"
redditblack,39z5um,Corvese,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:35:42 2015 UTC,"no because they want people dropping more money on the new games and DLC, not having people just load up their 360 discs onto their xbox."
redditblack,39z5um,tdvx,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:39:00 2015 UTC,But the two aren't mutually exclusive.  Anybody who loves black ops 2 enough that they wouldn't want to buy the next cod could just continue playing black ops 2 now.
redditblack,39z5um,Corvese,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:41:13 2015 UTC,I will play BO2 regardless of when this feature is released.

redditblack,39u2ch,LackingAGoodName,2,Sun Jun 14 22:55:52 2015 UTC,On the RAM side of things that's a big nope. A lot of the data work I do is really CPU and RAM intensive so the more the merrier. I currently have a laptop that I use as a home workstation and it has 16Gb that is usually close to or maxing out.  As far as the 4TB HDD I think I bought a 2TB but I have a large collection of FLAC MKVs from Blu-rays so most of the drive will be media. Eventually I'll make my own home based NAS.

It's kind of like the last shot I did in this one but I start from the other end of the table - jump a ball and hit one into the side. The jump has extreme right curve and cushion cuts the right corner and then spins directly into the neighboring corner. Tough to do because it requires an accurate jump, tons of spin/english and perfect placement of the object balls.  I'll get it soon though!"

redditblack,39h1xi,ITK_REPEATEDLY,6,Thu Jun 11 18:40:54 2015 UTC,"The point everyone keeps missing is not that the sub was banned for being offensive, that alone is not ban worthy. It was because they started vote brigading, doxxing, promoting harassment across subs and other sites, etc.  The people outraged at this are full on retards and so hilariously full of themselves saying they are boycotting reddit and this is the beginning of the downfall, etc. when in reality no one will give a shit in the long-term and they'll be back in two weeks anyway."
redditblack,39h1xi,Blastergasm,6,Fri Jun 12 01:01:32 2015 UTC,I love all these people saying they are going to jump ship to that voat website. All the subs that were banned are filled with people id rather not associate myself with.  Good riddance

redditblack,39h1xi,tdvx,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:40:42 2015 UTC,"I got banned from FPH a few weeks ago for blowing up an obviously fake post. Guy said one of his students wrote this poem that was just bashing fat people.  Written in the shittiest handwriting in pencil on blank paper, obciously fake.  In the comments he said he was an AP English teacher. Checking his post history he was an EMT, 28yo polisci major, 18 year old student asking or homework help, has a brother on Deadliest Catch, a post asking what was inside skyscrapers, several racist posts, and a ton of gramatical errors.   So I screenshotted all of his autistic lies and called gin out. I think the mods weren뗪 happy that someone was blowing that guy up because almost all of that sub was fake content. Got to like +50 before it was deletes and I was banned.   You see all the retards posting about it like they have today and yesterday, these people were all concentrated in one sub, the place was a total shit show. I think reddit is better without it but I thinks its ridiculous that the other hate subs have not been banned."
redditblack,39h1xi,ITK_REPEATEDLY,3,Thu Jun 11 19:01:50 2015 UTC,100% agree. Hateful sub? Maybe. The fact they go after that one though is fucking ridiculous.

Stopped clicking on fph post after that.   As much as I dislike the place, remove all the hate subs or none at all. Although I read a little bit about the FPH mods doxxing which is what may have started this whole shit show, they put someones picture and personal info in the sidebar or something like that.

Old world blues was great, dead money was great etc. The faction system was great and the various different endings that could play out. The followers were better too.  However It was missing craftable weapons, and the locale of DC is hard to beat as far as pure recognizable locations (especially if you've been there)."
redditblack,38szip,bbiyf,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:46:18 2015 UTC,I agree with Kaos. F:NV's DLC was amazing. Old World Blues was terrific. Dead Money was very underrated to me. People complain because it's mechanically challenging (which I'm a fan of) but had a wonderful storyline.   And Lonesome Road tied everything in together so well offering up the ultimate decision to nuke or not nuke. The other one with the triball people and Joshua Graham was meh but scenery wise was diff and cool to explore.

redditblack,38o3zt,brodoe,2,Fri Jun 5 14:21:46 2015 UTC,Been a hectic month for me. Was pretty unhappy at work and decided to YOLO it by giving my 2 weeks notice without another job lined up. Company wanted to keep me and gave me a decent pay pump and a promise of promotion at year end. Ended up selling my soul and staying for now. Took a lot of self restraint to not decline the offer. Not sure if it was the right decision but I decided to suck it up for now.

redditblack,38cu8j,BIacked0ut,5,Wed Jun 3 11:48:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting post. In our run from ghosts through AW we dismantled a large number of clans due to beating them in wars and it comes down to exactly what you are talking about management and planning. If you lack clear management during clan wars or have a bad mechanism for picking nodes you will fail. Clan Wars are about efficiency, fastest wins and communication on when/where to move.      I won't go into details but very early on in Ghosts the mods got together and figured out exactly how we would handle wars from a strat perspective and we went from there. Members do not question the commanders/party leaders because we have been so successful. ""Trust us guys we got this"" is something our guys hear many times during wars. It took many iterations to get to the point where we were in full swing with 80+ in ghosts moving fluidly. Running clan wars with a large amount of people is no simple task, don't let it get you down if you guys are having some growing pains or issues. Now a days we are in a very small bracket (19) because a bunch of our guys dislike AW, summertime, etc etc. Sure we could've gone the route that some other clans chose (ie mass recruitment) but like you've seen that actually causes more headaches then good. The benefit of keeping our core guys every iteration is when the next big game comes out we have a core group of veterans ready to go back to business as usual. I've been playing with some of these guys now for more than 3 years and getting to know them personally instead of being member #75 is what sets us apart from some of the clans with 5 rosters.          If you want some helpful tips, management needs to come down hard. Draft up some rules/guidelines that are strict but not to the point where it is no longer fun. If people disobey bench them for the next war. You are going to piss people off and you will lose members but if they cannot follow simple instructions you will be better off in the future. Be respectful on social media shit. I hate the twitter crap and yell at our guys about it consistently. You gain nothing from engaging in the trolling on twitter. If you ask around we have a pretty good rep with other clans because we try to stay out of all of this. Last but not least, win and lose respectfully. We lost the Battle Royale and it hurt bad. Sure there were other factors in play but we should've been able to overcome them and win, so that loss falls on us management/mods.    Bottom line, right now I hate AW, but I still log in for every clan war because I love playing with our members. If your guys dont enjoy playing with each other or cant get along as a group, there is no way you will have any success matching clans that can.    Good luck man, you aren't the first clan in this position and you wont be the last. Learn from whats happening and come back stronger."
redditblack,38cu8j,dRwEedThuMb,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:40:30 2015 UTC,"You raised so many excellent points. The leaders have the workplace mentality where ""you don't need to get along just play the damn wars/work together"". Or if people fight they just say ""block each other and move on"". That does not work like you said and I've told them this before.   Learn from whats happening and come back stronger.   We won't come back stronger. Management is stubborn and blames all losses on excuses and delusionally thinks we're ""great"" and we can compete with you guys and other big clans."
redditblack,38cu8j,BIacked0ut,2,Wed Jun 3 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"Another thing that makes Reddit Black superior, in my opinion, to all other clans/communities is the organization. As you see here we have this subreddit. Every member knows to check this place and everything gets layed out n planned right here. I know some other larger clans have websites or twitter whatever but it doesn't come close to what we've built here.  Furthermore, rBLK is made up of adults. That's not a jab at others,  we know adolescents enjoy vidya games just like us but when we put our brains, gaming experience, and real life teachings all together... we are unstoppable. Plain and simple. We don't have the best pub slayers or top UMG pros but when we form into one for the greater good, we are the best."

redditblack,38cu8j,Tjacks12,0,Wed Jun 3 17:28:19 2015 UTC,"""Workplace Mentality""    See, I think a bunch of clans fall into this role. People need to remember many of us play videogames because it takes us away from the stress of work / RL. You can be competitive and play in clan wars without it feeling like a job. For management it may feel like a job setting it up and running the show, but they are mangement, it comes with the role. Keeping members happy keeps community strong. If your members aren't happy, then management isnt happy, then no one is happy and RIP.    Again, you are just one side of a story but most of the problems you have talked about are all problems that every clan faces at some point or another."

redditblack,38cu8j,realbynight,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:48:53 2015 UTC,"""They're session joining look at their clan members their names look familiar from the past few days they've been joining our games.""   While I'm pretty sure we haven't run into our competition so far in the 19-bracket wars (for all I know, many of them might be on 360 instead of XB1), we do seem to have at least a few times every CW when one of parties runs into a full HG, Pwn or other large clan team. And I think we actually played against some of you guys in our wars, because matchmaking put us together. It's all about which playlist we're going after (we don't know the population #'s in each, but I suspect some only have a few thousand playing worldwide), the regions our respective parties are in, and timing (two parties searching for a lobby at the same time). If both clans are, say, going after Hardcore KC, and we each have parties located on the East Coast, the chances are decently high that they could get matched against each other.  Ironically, one of the complaints from non-CW players is that they don't like CW's being in public matchmaking, and they should have clans only face other clans directly. But when this happens as a fluke from regular matchmaking, clans assume it must be because of session-joining.  Also, again as a consequence of small playlist populations, it's increasingly likely that you can run into the same randoms again and again, or they backout of one of your clan's matches...only to be added in progress to another of your matches in progress."
redditblack,38cu8j,im_reflex,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:27:27 2015 UTC,Please explain how teams are made. I'm curious.
redditblack,38cu8j,aariakon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:23:04 2015 UTC,"Each member of management leads a team, and they all pick their teams together.  Alright, so basically the Corrupt Kings have all average-above-barely below average players, but the Mercs side has the amazing players and the very bad players.  People don't mix, the Kings have their teams we have ours. Thing is, when you're playing vs good clans in pubs and you have 2 amazing players but 4 bad-average players, you won't win because carrying isn't possible when playing good opposing teams.  But most of the time the teams are just purely unbalanced on the Mercs side. Management doesn't realize that and they make 2 very good squads and 3 terrible squads. & the terrible squads also don't have people who can communicate via Skype usually, so we end up not being able to effectively communicate which node we are trying to play.  The Kings lose some games here and there but overall they are more balanced out.   To sum up:    Top 5 Mercs Players > Top 5 Kingz players.  All Mercs members < All Kingz members"

redditblack,37puor,tbatts33,2,Fri May 29 15:35:01 2015 UTC,Warriors have lost 3 games at home all year including the playoffs. I don't think Cleveland can win 2 on the road and the Warriors will win at least 1 in Cleveland.  Warriors have more depth and know how to take away players options on defense and they have more ways to score then Cleveland.

A ton of time went into this but basically when a developer 'pushes' his code to where we store the code this system will pull it down and simulate it actually running and then run a ton of test we've written to make sure the data/etc is all working correctly.   When the tests pass successfully they trigger a deploy to live servers.  All automated.  We had a system like this before, but it wasn't as polished as this one is. Put a ton of work into it."

redditblack,37puor,joshlove,1 point,Fri May 29 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"Different holsters fill different roles usually. The ""range"" holster is just a cheap slide in holster for quick trips to the range. It's not meant for retention and you can't adjust the carry angle. Retention is a big deal for concealed (and to a greater extent open) carry.  The Kydex one is adjustable, so you can use it for right/left side carry and adjust the cant of the grip for your drawstroke.  The shoulder holster was given to me, I've never worn it. Suit and tie is a good reason to use one though.  The leather bianchi is the one I actually carried it in most of the time, and when I wasn't using that one I was using one that I made that was a mix of leather and kydex. I have some pictures of that one I think."

It's a beer that's brewed in CT by a guy from Vermont (or New Hampshire I can't remember).  It's almost impossible to find in stores but a friend of mine works for a liquor distributor so he's been able to get it a few times.  Last night we went to a random bar and they had it on tap.  Apparently they have a deal worked out so they get it regularly.  I plan on being there as often as possible.

redditblack,37j3qy,Blastergasm,1 point,Thu May 28 00:30:12 2015 UTC,"officially my title is Assisted Sales and Training Representative. What that means is that I go to different stores (mainly Walmarts and Best Buys) and train associates and help sell products for the store I'm in for the day.  Frequently, this means I drive anywhere from 40-70% of my work. But they pay for time in the car and mileage reimbursement. It also allows me to travel across states and take interesting photos of dilapidated school houses or anything else I find interesting along the road. I even got to drive through the geological center of North America (Rugby, ND) a couple times...not a very large town at all and pretty boring scenery lol  edit: can't believe I forgot but thank you for your congratulations!"

redditblack,37fquh,Rancidwind,5,Wed May 27 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"Solid app, but here's my suggestion: Focus on school over the summer boss.  If money is tight for the family, a) you're not going to be able to play games with the guys to even see if you fit, and b) you should probably spend the cash on something more fit for the summer time or save for BO3.  I know it's months away, but maybe stick around reddit and the sub and come reapply for BO3.  Whether you want to wait that long is up to you, but that's my humble suggestion as a grown ass man trying to help out a teenage kid."
redditblack,37fquh,Rancidwind,1 point,Wed May 27 12:41:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'll be going to Summer School Mon - Fri, 8am - 2pm, iirc Clan Wars doesn't usually start until 3pm my time.

redditblack,37fquh,TrollaBot,1 point,Wed May 27 19:53:39 2015 UTC,There's always the option of trading in some of your current games at a gamestop or something. That is assuming you're okay with getting shit value for each of them.

redditblack,37fquh,ITK_REPEATEDLY,2,Fri May 29 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"Evanescence? What is this 2002? Fuck man that was my middle school years all over.   Great app man, thank you for taking the time to format it and give us some insight to you.   I currently don't play AW but feel free to stay active in the clan by posting news/clips/etc and what not. Just because you don't have AW doesn't mean you can't be a member of our community here.  I currently play a lot of Smite on X1 and some BFH here and there.    I know a lot of the guys play CS:GO and even if you have an old PC  it could run it on low.   So I'll ask you some questions just to get to know you better...   What other hobbies do you have as a 15yo? Sports? movies? I see you like Graphics Design. Do you have any work you can show off (like a portfolio) Tango is an amazingly hard worker when it comes to this sub and it's CSS but what would YOU like to see done with the sub as a perspective member? What was your first gaming experience? what got you hooked?"
redditblack,37fquh,nrg_uw,1 point,Wed May 27 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I got a Alpha Code for Smite and I tried it for a little bit, the thing is that Games such as Smite aren't really my type, ya know? I have nothing aginst the Game, it just isn't something that interests me.  I played a little bit of BFH when I had it, really like that game actually!   I don't have too many Hobbies I guess... I don't play for any Local Teams, I'm more of an observer when it comes to Sports. Huge Royals (Baseball) and Chiefs (Football) Fan, but I'm probably biased since those are Kansas City Teams. I'm a big Movie Watcher, Action, Horror and Comedy Movies are my favorites. Favorite Movie of all time would have to be Will Smith's I Am Legend! I've watched that Movie probably a dozen times and could still watch it again. I am into Graphic Design, definitely not a Professional, maybe average or above average? I don't have much work to show at the moment, I just recently lost my Hard Drives to an old faulty computer. I was also an Editor for a friend who used to Snipe on Black Ops 2. Did that for about a year, got bored a deleted the channel lol. Agreed, I think Tango did a great job with the Sub. I think that with a New Title (BO3) we should get a New Sub Design based around that New Title. Maybe a bit more Up-to-Date with all of the Latest CSS Features and such. As I said in my App, as a younger kid, I was a HUGE Fan of Guitar Hero, THPS and Goldeneye. My first Console was a PS2, I played tons of Games, Crash Bandicoot, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, Need for Speed and Burnout being others I remember. My first gaming experience I honestly don't remember, I played a lot of Games back in those days. The thing that got me hooked was when I first started seriously playing COD, on Black Ops 1. I've played COD since WaW but I never really played serious, more of just a pastime. My greatest memories are back on Black Ops 1, that's probably gotta be my favorite COD Game. I'm also a huge nerd when it comes to the Fallout Games, New Vegas is by far my favorite of the series, I super excited for the next Fallout Installment."
redditblack,37fquh,ITK_REPEATEDLY,2,Wed May 27 22:02:34 2015 UTC,"Hey, great app.    Shame you don't own the current CoD title but add me anyway and feel free to hop into my party chat whenever you see me on.  I keep meaning to play more Titanfall but don't want to play solo.  I am a little concerned that you're 15 but this is typed up so well.  I was an immature, trash-talking little shit at that age."
redditblack,37fquh,TrollaBot,1 point,Thu May 28 11:04:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah, sucks but I guess there's always another chance to Join rBLK when I do have the Game. I'll add you next time I'm on, we can play a few Games of Titanfall. I'm no pro at that Game, but I'm decent, haha. Probably better at COD than Titanfall.  And yeah, no worries.

redditblack,37bnb6,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Tue May 26 15:16:05 2015 UTC,Level 13. I stumbled across what appeared to be an abandoned house in the middle of the forest in Velen. There was a man that had been hung with his hands tied behind his back and a bag over his head. I walked into the house to loot and lying dead on the bed was a women and child. The fast travel marker popped up and described how the family had decided to build a house in the woods against the advice of their friends. Him and his family thought that they had avoided the war until one night.   Not a quest or anything it's just something that really adds to the whole atmosphere of the game. I've gone the route of fast attack spam. I find that getting in close and getting a hit or two in and being able to dodge/roll away to be super effective against pretty much anything I've fought.  I have around 60 hours played and have yet to cross the Pontar haha.

I live in the only town in America that celebrates this outside of Italy (it's an Italian holiday, and the town is almost 100% Italian).  If you go here there are a lot of pictures of what goes on.  Basically the Jessup Carnival is in town for a few days with a beer tent and live music the whole weekend. And on Saturday, a race happens between three statues that represent the Saints ending at a field in the middle of town.  It's a good time because everyone is drunk.  I'll be starting by 11 am tomorrow and lasting as long as I can."

redditblack,36vijy,StewBeer,1 point,Fri May 22 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"Lots of stuff to say on this FTF.   Back in January, I injured my thumb skiing, sprained the tendon on my knuckle between my thumb and index finger. It is still causing me problems to this day, and the orthopedist said there pretty much isn't anything I can do except let time heal it, could take another 3-6 months. If I play any more than an hour it really starts bothering me, so I think my COD time is going to be somewhat limited until BO3 comes out. Both of the above being said, I still enjoy playing and will be happy to be an alternate for CW if we're down a man for a day. If I just put a little bengay on my thumb and pop an ibuprofen I'll be fine, just can't make a habit of it. I'll make a separate post about this at some point soon, but here goes. There has been talk about it before, but no one has taken the initiative for a New England rBLK meetup, I'd like to host one. I don't have any plans yet but let me know if you are interested."

Most assistants are also up and coming artists and you have to have a really solid relationship work wise as well as being able to be extremely organized and detail orientated.    Prime and prepare canvas Clean brushes and organize material to be used for the day Keep main studio and bathroom/ kitchenette clean Go to art store and also online and keep all paint, brushes, etc stocked as well as making sure there's coffee, toilet paper, food, at all times.  Box, package and mail paintings to galleries/ collectors  Handle incoming mail and bills as well as cheques. I do the banking I just need it sorted and the junk mail weeded out. Answer the phone. Take messages etc.  Help set up and hang shows in the galleries.  Be able to mix paint. Know colour charts and how to mix to tone. Be able to paint confidently with a brush. Be able to do fill ins and small touch ups. Must Drive and have own vehicle. You'll be running around town quite a bit.  Listen to old school hip hop/ old school hardcore punk / sports talk radio daily. Must like ""Raspberry Beret"" by Prince and ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" by the Go Gos Make travel arrangements and book hotels etc. plan out itineraries and make a list of restaurant/ cool bars to visit. You must Passport and able to travel at the last minute.  Must not be a fan of any Chicago sports teams or The Toronto Maple Leafs.                   What you get:   $10.00 per hour. You'll never get a raise.  Learn the inside outs of the ""art for a living"" business aka doing this shit for reals. Travel all over the world for free. Paris, Miami, NY, Italy, LA. You'll be travelling a lot.  Meet gallery people and other artists and get in the ""old boys club"" without having to make a Brazzers video.  Lots of free diners, lunches and drinks.

If you use an exotic shard on an existing exotic helmet, chest, or boot piece that'll be enough for it to go to level 34.  Then you just need to do the nightfall and/or the Prison of Elders arena to get 2 pieces of ""etheric light"" which can be used on ANY piece of legendary (purple) gear to 'ascend' it to the max light level.   Example:  Exotic Helmet (use exotic shard which you probably already have) - 42 light  Story Gauntlets you get for beating the missions - 42 light  Any Purple Chest Piece (can be VoG gear, vendor, seriously any). Use etheric light will ascend it to 42 light.  Same thing for boots to get to 42 light.  Bang you're a 34.  And you get a guaranteed etheric light for beating level 34 and level 35 arena the first time of the week."

I have had a scuf, and I also have this controller.  Scuf is hit and miss with quality, but I got a great build.  Controller held up really well.  Took me 6 weeks to get it, and it was nothing more than a standard build for $130+.  Meanwhile, I got the same quality from kaos for less than half the price.  Had an issue with my rear button no longer responding, shipped to him, and he fixed it for free.  Got it back 4 days after it left my house.  Good luck with that type of service from Scuf."

redditblack,36kok8,SpeclalK,4,Wed May 20 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"check out your bank statements online or through Mint.com or the mint app and figure out your monthly expenses. I did this last month and found found i was being charged $72/yr just to keep my checking account open, so i switched to another bank which has $0 monthly fees and even pays interest (it's only .1% or some shit but it's better than -$6 each month). I took a look at my phone and realized i was paying $76/month for unlimited data, 450 mins, and 0 texts. Switching to tmobile i can do a 2 year $60/mo for unlimited everything or a prepaid $30/mo unlim data & text + 100 mins. Over the course of that 2 year contract i'd save $384, and $604 in 2 years if i switch to the prepaid plan. I also shaved off $5/year on my domain registration. I also started driving 65 instead of 75 on the highway, and even though my commute is 2 mins longer, i'm getting 23 MPG instead of 18 on the highway which will cut down my total gas expenses by about 10%.  I mean i have very few monthly expenses, and these are just some examples, but since you're paying rent and utilities and probably a shit ton of other things, you can probably find a lot more places to save larger amounts of money. I spent 1 day looking at my monthly expenses and just cut out some useless shit, and i'm saving almost 2 week's worth of pay each year because of it. I've always been tight and responsible with money, and i'm surprised that i was letting that much go.  check out some of the top threads and search around in /r/personalfinance and /r/frugal. /r/frugal can be a bit of a circlejerk and a bit extreme, but there's definitely some good savings tips there."

Check out YNAB (You Need a Budget). It forces users to take a proactive approach to budgeting by manually recording all transactions. It's such a pain in the ass at first but you develop an incredibly healthy habit.  And the best part? Students get to use it for free. All you have to do is send them a picture of your student ID and they'll email you an activation code that is valid for a calendar year.  Normally, the license is a one time payment of $60. I grabbed my license key during a Steam Summer Sale for $15."

It really is, if AW is getting stale to you (as it was for me), GET THIS GAME.  I find myself alternating between AW and HL and neither game gets old for me.  Fun things to do:   Ride shotgun hanging out the window with an RPG/grenade launcher in a cop car that is blaring rap music and fuck shit up. Run up behind someone, taser them, then interrogate them to find out where the entire enemy team is on your radar. Then tea bag said tasered individual. Use the grapple hook to get on top of an obscure building, lay down with a 8X or 16X zoom sniper rifle, and feel like American Sniper.  Camp on the top floor of a sky scraper and wait for person after person to come up the elevator and ruin their day.  Get in a custom TDM server with 64 people on a small map to 1600 kills, embrace the chaos and bad spawns. Snipe the pilot out of a helicopter then steal the helicopter Do badass takedowns Parachute off of a tall building, shoot a guy off a motorcycle, then get pancaked on the sidewalk."

I find the multiplayer fun, but certain modes need work. TDM spawns are janky.  Hotwire is a great way to warm up for conquest or VIP or rescue (snd).  Hit detection is dead on. Having vehicles mainly restricted to getting you from point to point than all of them being weaponized is awesome.  There really arent too many 'cheap' mechanics in the game either. Health comes back at a good rate (slower than cod, but it does come back). The game modes and challenges are fun and you can help your team in a number of roles that require you to understand the role beyond just YOLOing it.  I dig it a lot."

I think the campaign is a lot of fun, even if after awhile it can get redundant, but still, always had fun.   Multiplayer is challenging with the crazy spawns, and huge ass maps, but the hit detection is amazing. If only cod could have this kind of hit detection.   I haven't gotten to play it with a group of friends yet, but I enjoy playing it by myself, which I can't say for many multiplayer games.   Overall I'd highly recommend it if people want a change of pace type game that is pretty fun."

But from what I read, it seems like it's the same as the mod panel minus the mod privileges on our sub. Are the mods going to be a part of the council? Like, if you're a mod, you're automatically on the council? Or will it be reserved for the members to have a spot to get a say in everyday things? Will the mods be higher up than the council and have the ultimate say? Or will the council be kinda like elected senators, the mod team be like the close advisors to the president, and B0 be the president?  I love the idea of getting more people in with more ideas but I'm just not understanding how it's different."

redditblack,36f0w9,RabidGrinch,1 point,Tue May 19 00:30:41 2015 UTC,"The guys I work with (web designers and engineers) have a range that goes from $80 an hour, to $180 an hour. This is like junior level all the way up to senior - and a lot of it is custom development in rails etc.  The problem is that design is often it's own discipline, and backend stuff another. If it's purely visual, it's toward the lower end of that spectrum.   My contract rate for sysadmin stuff was $140 when I was still doing that. Current job has a no-moonlighting clause for me though, so no more of that."
redditblack,36f0w9,joshlove,1 point,Tue May 19 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"If it's purely visual, it's toward the lower end of that spectrum.   Not necessarily. People pay a LOT of money for the design portion, and that's actually where most of the charge comes from in web design.  Any code monkey can put stuff where they're supposed to go using SASS, HTML etc. The real money part is coming up with that image for your client, how things are placed, colors, logos etc.  Now this is strictly web design speaking. Integration with a stack framework is a whole nother beast, but most of the times these jobs don't involve that."
redditblack,36f0w9,zpoon,1 point,Tue May 19 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"It might also depend on where you're at. Around here, visual/design folks are paid less when it's on contract. How many art/design schools you have in the area affects this rate too.  We have a whole team of designers at work, but most of them are focusing on branding/product stuff. They come up with the designs/photoshop etc and then have someone implement the CSS/JS/etc side of it.  If you're doing the graphics and the implementation of it...maybe you can command more, but in this area it's just not the case (we have a lot of design schools and a big CS community as well)."
redditblack,36f0w9,joshlove,1 point,Tue May 19 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"People tend to undervalue themselves so don't be afraid to charge more than you are comfortable with. I'd also charge for the project as a whole, not an hourly basis.  Do you have any idea how long it will take roughly? Half a week? A week? A month? All year? If it's a week's worth of work, $2k seems like a pretty good deal to me. You can extrapolate from there."
redditblack,36f0w9,TheMiamiWhale,1 point,Tue May 19 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"Charge a flat rate of $3k, and give me $100 for giving you that amount."
redditblack,36f0w9,aariakon,1 point,Tue May 19 16:34:28 2015 UTC,"I would try and estimate how long the revamp would take and base it off an hourly rate. Try looking around at other freelancers that do the same type work use it to establish the range between over and under-charging.   Also, as you are just starting out, I wouldn't charge that much, as you do not have a portfolio or professional experience to back you up. Maybe do some small work for free?  Try your luck in /r/Favors. People post stuff like this all the time. Once you build up your portfolio and potential clients are able to see the work you have done, you would have a better grasp of how much time and effort you put in for what fee. From there, you could have a modest rate in which people could see what they are actually paying for."
redditblack,36f0w9,tmacsmith33,1 point,Mon May 18 21:56:56 2015 UTC,"Well i've already got a client lol. this was all just kinda thrown at me and i'm fully capable of doing the job. My mom does graphic design and her client asked her about their website, and she referred them to me. so here we are.  And i can't even come up with an hour estimate. i think it would be a lot easier if i could but the css work i do for school and here i just, do, i dont consciously think how many hours i put into it.  obviously i'm not going to charge top dollar lol. i'm certainly not worth top dollar and even if i was i have nothing really to prove it (atleast until i finish css v3 lol)."
redditblack,36f0w9,tmacsmith33,1 point,Mon May 18 22:00:00 2015 UTC,Try breaking down the development process and see how much time each step would take. I don't know jack shit about web design but I'm sure there are different stages in which you would be able to gauge how much time is needed before you could move on to the next one.
redditblack,36f0w9,joshlove,1 point,Mon May 18 22:06:35 2015 UTC,"Time estimation is a skill that's incredibly valuable to learn, not many people do it well when it comes to big projects. The other part is it depends on a person or team's skillset.  Example: we had a consultant say they could set XYZ up for us in a month and I asked why so long - they had a week listed for setting up the server itself - just the security patches and basic configuration. I asked why so long, and they said 'you can't build a server like that any faster, it takes time to have a sysadmin install all the packages etc' - So I had their sysadmin get me the list of packages they needed and specific config.   Took me an hour to drop it into puppet and literally 20 minutes to have the server up and running. I gave them the puppet manifest and now they could set up a server for this configuration in 20 minutes or less consistently. It cut 1/4 of the cost and time out of the project.  They simply had no idea there were tools out there like puppet.  Tons of books out there on the subject with different strategies - luckily it's one of the certifications out there that holds it's weight. The PMI has a ton of info on their site. (Im not PMI certified, but the PMs I typically work with are, and how close they're able to estimate when a project will/should finish)."

Also add the mods on the side bar and do the same thing with them.  My GT is 'Brofessor Ashes' as you can see in my flair.

redditblack,362xs2,DVS27t,2,Fri May 15 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"At this point I don't play COD at all because everyone on my list either doesn't play or plays S&D. I can see the allure, it's MUCH slower and easier to control, which is a good thing in AW. But I can play 1-2 games before I get bored of it.  I still have a lot more fun playing domination or hardpoint (basically any respawn besides TDM).  Hopefully BO3 will be better."
redditblack,362xs2,eSchiro,2,Fri May 15 17:52:58 2015 UTC,"Ya, i am over TDM. I like Dom because flag caps are 200 points! :-)"

redditblack,362xs2,bbiyf,1 point,Fri May 15 18:05:57 2015 UTC,"yeah, until I hop on to party up, then everyone will be back on S&D.  LOL"
redditblack,362xs2,Rancidwind,2,Fri May 15 18:21:27 2015 UTC,Pubs doesn't matter to me. I'd probably take respawn pubs over SnD pubs.  But competitive SnD > respawn.
redditblack,362xs2,eSchiro,2,Fri May 15 18:54:00 2015 UTC,"I play the hell out of domination on xbone. Love to be in the fight, hate searching for players and sitting on the sidelines"
redditblack,362xs2,eSchiro,1 point,Sat May 16 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"I bounce back and forth. Usually start a new cod with respawn, get bored with that and switch to SnD. Then we play that until I'm sick of that and go back. Lol."
redditblack,362xs2,fawse,1 point,Fri May 15 17:32:12 2015 UTC,Maybe it's because I was never a hardcore COD guy until Black Ops 2? Even then  I never got into S&D. Always a Domination guy. Maybe I am just a killstreak whore?!  I can get a 3-10 kills in an entire SnD game and that just seems slow to me. I love getting the 30+ score/kill streaks and racking up the flags. To each their own I guess?
redditblack,362xs2,dRwEedThuMb,1 point,Fri May 15 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, there's draw to both.  SnD - Slower and easier to control most of the time. You get to see your teammates in action sometimes. I've had a lot of ""Aw, shit, that was insane!"" moments in SnD because I can see teammates get clutches. You can regroup after bad rounds and discuss in a less hectic ways.  Also, In AW specifically, I feel like if you have a bad host it's easier to deal with SnD. I mean, you still get BS deaths and kills, but you could be a little more sneaky and patient, it seems. Respawn, you're just running into the same place everyone else is.  Respawn - Lots more room for scorestreaks and high kill gamplay. Fast paced. Set objective point so enemy location is generally predictable.  I love both."
redditblack,362xs2,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Fri May 15 18:05:23 2015 UTC,You're definitely not alone. I prefer pretty much any respawn over Snooze n Dreams.
redditblack,362xs2,Rancidwind,1 point,Fri May 15 17:40:26 2015 UTC,Maybe it's just the group that I have been playing with recently. It's still fun to play but after a couple games its like....this is way too slow for me.
redditblack,362xs2,S4R_ben,1 point,Fri May 15 17:41:57 2015 UTC,"Same. I play so I can play. Not watch others play. Inb4 well don't die. It's inevitable that you'll die. I dunno, have just always preferred the pace of respawn games.  Nothing will ever be as good as Hard point in Blops2."
redditblack,362xs2,TRU3_DJ,1 point,Fri May 15 17:56:01 2015 UTC,"Even when you don't die, it can be boring. Two guys on your team doing most of the slaying? Enemy team drops down to 2-3 people? You can end up going 2-0 in the match; great for your K/D, but not a lot of XP, and incredibly boring."
redditblack,362xs2,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Fri May 15 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, demolition in bo2 was a favorite of mine Over anything else."
redditblack,362xs2,Cipher1087,1 point,Sat May 16 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"I prefer Dom over any other game type in AW. I really enjoyed SnR in Ghosts, but don't really play SnD because...no tags or respawns. Admittedly, my skill level with AW is no where near what it was in Ghost's and previous CoD titles, so watching the rest of the team play while I wait for the round to end is buns. So yes, I agree with you."
redditblack,362xs2,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Fri May 15 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"I love AW actually, especially DOM. Just my opinion, i like the flag cap points. Just awesome lol"
redditblack,362xs2,Corvese,1 point,Fri May 15 18:15:24 2015 UTC,I'd have agreed with you a couple of weeks ago but SnD has really grown on me. Just the different pace of the game mode and the learning curve has gotten me hooked.   We've been jumping into Moshpit a lot lately too so that we get some variety.

redditblack,35vkjw,Rancidwind,2,Thu May 14 01:45:27 2015 UTC,this is for people to spend more money on advanced supply drops and only get elite exo's or duplicates.
redditblack,35vkjw,Feeceez,1 point,Thu May 14 02:14:13 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious as to what  the royalty weapons purpose are? Can you trade in the elite you have for them, or are they simply a ""copy"" of their partner elite? Stat wise they are the same to the some of the elite varients."
redditblack,35vkjw,royalBASSmaster,1 point,Thu May 14 02:33:33 2015 UTC,"Unless the stats were just placeholders, they'll likely be exact copies other than the exterior.  I mean, what's more likely from Sledgehammer: Carefully crafting several new variants with completely unique stats, or just reskinning the standard models with Royalty camo and reusing the stats of an existing Elite?"
redditblack,35vkjw,ParlHillAddict,1 point,Thu May 14 04:10:07 2015 UTC,Why pick the inferior elite varient for some of the royalties then?
redditblack,35vkjw,royalBASSmaster,1 point,Thu May 14 04:14:01 2015 UTC,"Because Sledgehammer.  I don't think they really care about balancing for variants. They just tweak the base values and assume everything works out. It's why the EPM3 Parsec's only positive is increased range...which is pointless, because it's a weapon that already does the same damage at all ranges."

Kind of like spawns are set but you get to choose which of X amount you want to go to... you get to peer at map kind of like how you would when you hit start and 'see' where players are if UAV is up or if they are firing.

redditblack,3579ob,Apologician,3,Fri May 8 02:59:26 2015 UTC,Nah it's all about that massive 3 hit kill range bb. The Steed has the farthest 3HK with the fastest fire rate making it the best gun. It is straight unfair to lose gunfights because that weapon is just better than mine with no way for me to obtain it other than pure luck or prestiging 16 times.
redditblack,3579ob,Rancidwind,1 point,Fri May 8 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"True on paper, but it doesn't always work like that with lag comp. the truth is that fire rate difference allows you to hit more shots quicker. I have them both and use the steed in more mid range maps. But in maps like recovery, I need that fire rate and handling. Combine those elements with the carbon's +1 damage, you get a 4 hit kill weapon that hits its mark more consistently for close range maps. It's weird, on paper, the steed has everything just about beat. Once you use the weapon consistently, you'll see what I'm talking about."

redditblack,355wnm,joshlove,3,Thu May 7 11:14:38 2015 UTC,CAMPER!
redditblack,355wnm,steveo831,1 point,Thu May 7 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"lol, this was actually us counter camping them. They had one guy on our team who was sitting with them being their radar to tell them when someone was coming and they had this one corner of the map on lock during hotwire. So Sianvar, Simply and I just straight up locked that whole area down after we got their initial camp cleared out. They spent the rest of the game spawning in base and then staying out of bounds so they could snipe without being snuck up on."
redditblack,355wnm,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Thu May 7 14:30:44 2015 UTC,This does not match up with previous battlefields... gravity would've fucked that shot in half.
redditblack,355wnm,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Thu May 7 12:35:53 2015 UTC,"It's because I was aiming downward - there's still drop, it's just not as dramatic. If you are shooting flat or up in this game you can actually see your bullets drop - they have a small white haze around them.  Edit: Make it full screen - I was aimed above both of em."
redditblack,355wnm,ITK_REPEATEDLY,1 point,Thu May 7 12:57:22 2015 UTC,"Game actually looks good though.  BF always makes some games with nice graphics, but they significantly changed their in game physics."
redditblack,355wnm,dRwEedThuMb,1 point,Thu May 7 13:02:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the landscape cant be destroyed in this game, but overall I've had a ton of fun with HL and the way it handles some of the previous physics BF used (which I wasn't crazy about all of them).  The weapons are very well balanced though. Certain guns have great power but tremendous recoil, or reload speed. Or great close range effectiveness, but aren't even viable at distance. Explosives are great against vehicles but not as great against players (except rockets).  The maps are big but they give you great ways to traverse them, either by spawn system or vehicles (and most of the vehicles arent weaponized), or grappling hooks. Recovering health is slow unless you have health packs.  The game modes are a little bare, but hostage rescue (search & retrieve), VIP modes are really fun. Conquest is standard dom style play, and hotwire is good for low-effort fucking around.  I dig it."
redditblack,355wnm,S4R_ben,1 point,Thu May 7 13:13:37 2015 UTC,"If it weren't $60 and I had more time to play more games, I'd pick it up.  Still dying to play CS, and I haven't even picked that up yet.  I need to do that."
redditblack,355wnm,S4R_ben,1 point,Thu May 7 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"It's just too slow for me. The movement, going from walking to running to ADSing, it's too slow for my taste. Probably my biggest gripe about BF games."

redditblack,35639k,eSchiro,2,Thu May 7 12:33:27 2015 UTC,I have owned Sony Bluetooth Wireless Headset (The old ones) and a wired Turtle Beach. Both worked very well. Never used any of the specific models you list there. Heard good things about the Golds.
redditblack,35639k,MRbraneSIC,1 point,Thu May 7 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"Ya, the golds get awesome reviews on every website i visit. I may have to give them a shot."
redditblack,35639k,BerserkerB,1 point,Thu May 7 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"I used a gold headset before. It was nice while I had it. I upgraded to the astros after, though, so I no longer have it. But the sound quality was good."
redditblack,35639k,dRwEedThuMb,2,Thu May 7 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"I have the golds, had them since the start and they have never given me a problem. Sound quality is good, I'd recommend them."
redditblack,35639k,BerserkerB,1 point,Thu May 7 14:07:54 2015 UTC,I am going to give them a shot. Appreciate everyone's two cents.
redditblack,35639k,HostileHokie,1 point,Thu May 7 14:20:41 2015 UTC,I have the wireless golds also and they are just ok. The voice chat to me is bad quality. Game sound is fine but chat is below average. You don't have that problem?
redditblack,35639k,joshlove,1 point,Thu May 7 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"No sir, might wanna mess around with the buttons on the side of the headset. I know sometimes when I hit those it messes everything up, just gotta find a balance that sounds good to you."
redditblack,35639k,Prodeje79,1 point,Thu May 7 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"Never had this issue as well. I think a couple of times they reset back to default settings and I had to adjust the party chat sounds back to my liking - but no issues. I didn't download the equalizer app on ps4, so if you're using that it could be part of the issue."
redditblack,35639k,lilnest25,2,Thu May 7 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"Build your own! :D  http://imgur.com/lve6Rq2  40mm drivers, boom mic wired into it with TRRS on the end. Capacitor in the line to remove any potential high freqs. Crushed velvet ear cups."
redditblack,35639k,007chill,10,Thu May 7 14:33:30 2015 UTC,"LOL, i can't even put lego's together."
redditblack,35639k,StewBeer,2,Thu May 7 14:36:17 2015 UTC,"I appreciate all the feedback, you guys are awesome. I think I will pull the plug on the Golds for now. Can't go wrong for $81. If that ain't up to par for my taste I will check out the Astro's. If that still doesn't satisfy my needs I will go play outside."
redditblack,35639k,eSchiro,2,Thu May 7 17:57:39 2015 UTC,Ive had great luck with used mixamps.  Needs to be at least a 2013 model though.  RIght now there is one here locally for $110 with a40s......  Icon plans to buy it though.
redditblack,35639k,HostileHokie,1 point,Thu May 7 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"If you're on a budget, the Sony Golds are worth the price, I used those for awhile until I upgraded to Astro A40s. I know some people are picky about their headset being wired or wireless."
redditblack,35639k,lilnest25,1 point,Thu May 7 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"My friend has an A40 and it is awesome, but i don't think its $250 awesome. I ran some XP400's that I thought were just as good and only $130. Maybe I am cheap? lol"
redditblack,35639k,HostileHokie,3,Thu May 7 14:59:11 2015 UTC,A lot of us have Astro Refurbs.   They're only 170-180 on Amazon

redditblack,3555kn,Feeceez,2,Thu May 7 21:10:21 2015 UTC,"I really like what you've made here. Solid song choice, good clips, and fairly good editing.   Here's my suggestions and what I'm planning to do with a future SnD tage. On Aces where there's nothing going on except you running around or looking for someone, speed up those parts. I noticed you know how to slow clips down, so do the reverse and speed up the boring parts. Another alternative is to remove pieces of the video so it skips forward, similar to how the last tage started by stuttering forward. If that doesn't make sense, lmk I'll explain it differently.   Color never hurts a tage imo and it's all subjective, but up to you. Adding sound effects like a crowd cheering or an announcer saying something cool lol just things off the top of my head that would make it cool imo.   Logic's music is pretty nice, I think we may do this guy for the next tage. Good work man!"
redditblack,3555kn,aariakon,2,Thu May 7 16:58:35 2015 UTC,Thanks Fam ill definitely work on that

redditblack,3559xq,Corvese,2,Thu May 7 23:44:34 2015 UTC,This is because that speed test is to a local server. The xbox test is to their northwest servers.
redditblack,3559xq,tdvx,2,Thu May 7 14:15:24 2015 UTC,His latency shouldn't be anywhere near what it is in the xbox picture though. 450ms is insane.
