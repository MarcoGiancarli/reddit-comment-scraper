kickstarter,3e2r2k,learnnearn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"The tech world is filled to the brim with people who have really awesome ideas for start-ups but no technical skills. So much so that people with tech skills are very reluctant to partner with such people, who typically have unrealistic ideas of how much work coding is or how long it takes.   Since you also don't have business skills, you're going to have an even harder time, as that's usually the type of skill that the non-technical person brings to a startup partnership. Envision this thing a year down the road, after you've somehow raised all the money and the app has been coded and has gone live. What role are you taking at the business? What are you contributing?  My advice is to learn enough coding to at least make a prototype of the app. You'll flesh out your idea in ways that currently haven't occurred to you, and you will make yourself much more attractive to potential technical partners since you've shown both that you have some grasp of the challenges of coding and that you aren't going to sit back and take credit for the hard work of others without putting in any work yourself because your initial idea was so brilliant and you think coming up with ideas is the hard part. (That latter part being a sadly common phenomenon.) Having a good technical partner will make getting funding much easier."
kickstarter,3e2r2k,TryUsingScience,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"I can understand you situation, as I am also a person with non-technical education, but with great interest in technology. Because of my interest, I have been learning for over a year, a lot of things about startups. To follow up on the advice that was already given, think of what role can you fulfill in the startup. Maybe you don't have business education, but do you think you can handle or quickly figure out how to handle business operations. A lot of successful people who start startups have no idea what they are doing. That is why you should think of a startup as a different type of organization and not as a small company. So for now, I would forget about setting up a corporation. You are more like a research group, that tries to prove that its idea will work. You might have a great idea, or to put it more correctly, you might think you might have a great idea, but the users might not actually like it or use it. Either way, you won't know until you test.  So first advice, write everything you think about your app down. Writing helps you clear a lot of issues and questions. Think of and research other similar apps that resemble functionality of your app. You have already done this and you say they are very successful. How is your app different from them and how are you going to take away market share from them? Where are they failing? Draw mockups of your app, what functions will it have and think loosely how can these functions be implemented in technical terms, you don't have to write a code, but write a pseudo code. If you have friends with tech skills, invite them over a beer and ask them if it is technically possible to implement the functions that you want to implement. If not ask online (and never, ever, worry about non-disclosure agreements and not telling people what you idea is. Nobody will steal your idea, most likely case is people will not care about your idea and that is the worst. Companies die because no one cares what they are doing, not because somebody stole an idea from them. Don't work in a stealth mode, you will lose to the market). Think what are the downsides of your app? Think, briefly, how you can make money out of this app, but if you can't think of this, don't worry, a lot of mature companies don't know how to monetize either.   After all this, you need to develop a prototype that will be your MVP, minimum viable product. This is a product that has bare bones and very limited functionality. You should then start testing this app with different groups (try A/B testing) and see what functions people, want. Try adding small functions, and test whether you hypothesis about the functions, that they are useful is true. If they are not true, despite the fact that you thought they were great, abandon them and try to function.  Now, thinking like this, researching other apps and thinking about functionality and how to implement those functions, how long does it take to implement them, will help you think like a product manager (learn a little bit about Scrum as well). This is a quite important function, especially in a startup. It is not a separate job, but usually something that co-founders do.   Speaking of co-founders, you need to find someone who will develop a prototype for you. This is most likely going to be your technical co-founder, as you cannot afford to hire a full time developer with an equity into a non-existent company, developers will not go for that as they have a lot of options. Your co-founder will supervise most of the technical stuff and you will have to figure out business, marketing, operations and product, to some extent. He obviously gets 50% of the company, if he puts a full time effort in your app (obviously these 50-50% will be chipped away by a little bit when you start finding investors and giving equity to employees). Finding a tech co-founder can be very hard, depending where you live and what you do. If you are a student, you should try to hang out with tech students, go to their parties, invite several of them to your party, drink together, bond, and see if you can become good friends, as you will be working and going through hard time in next 2-3 years. If you think you have made a very good friend, with tech skills, try to pitch you idea to him or her, broadly when you are drinking beer, and then next day seriously and in full details and try to convince him to work with you. Show him or her, that you know what you are talking about, you have market research done, you know what the product should look like but you want to hear his ideas as well. Make sure you are good friends. If you are not in a college, then try local tech meetups, again depends on your location, if you are in California, there are tons of those, but it is very hard to get hold of tech people there. If you live in big European city, like London or Berlin, same, go to meetups and make tech friends.   I think it is very early to think about compensating investors and setting up business. You have to know if your startup idea is worth it and if it will work. So start developing product first, forget about money for now. Until you have a prototype, you business idea is worth 0$. It's like I have an idea to fly to the Moon and it will be awesome, but the investors need to see that I can build a rocket ship, maintain it, get to the moon and etc and maintaining startup is almost as difficult as flying a rocket ship. Just because other people have done it, does not mean I will be able to do it as well.   Alternatively, you can go to an incubator, give them 5-7% of your equity, if they like your idea, and they will help you develop, give you resources and inspiration (and usually an investment).  Good luck to you!"

kickstarter,3e1sse,thereply,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:50 2015 UTC,"The pens are actually always connected via bluetooth, so there is only a backup cache on the pen to cover the time (~ 20 pages), when there is not bluetooth connection. On the computer, of course, you can easily store more than 100.000 pages. Depends on your free storage :)  The data is stored as recorded strokes. So it is easy to compress and does only need little space and can be saved as both pixel images (pngs, jpegs, gifs) and vector graphics (svg, pdf) but also HTML. So basically you can just copy&paste the written strokes into Word/Powerpoint/Libreoffice or Adobe Tools/Inkscape or whatever is able to read those formats."

kickstarter,3dv0xy,whymanipulatedata,12,Sun Jul 19 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"I do this work on occasion, and I would probably turn down this job unless I knew you personally. I would say that anybody who takes your money at this point is, if not a scam, at least not looking out for your interests.  Unfortunately, a lot of your marketing really needs to be done earlier and I would probably write this project launch off. My free advice would be to continue to push it and try to get the word out, but not to expect it to fund. It could still succeed, but the first three days are pretty key.  That said, an unfunded project is a great starting point for a relaunch, and it's almost never in your interest to cancel a project unless you're certain that you won't be able to fulfill your rewards or there's a legal dispute that you know is going to complicate it."

One one hand you will gain a few more contacts (not a lot as its not getting funded) one the other you are putting forth a negative image of yourself, company and execution.  I personally would cancel rework the prework for 3-4 months and re launch strong.   Also if you cancel you can try to put a positive spin on it."
kickstarter,3dv0xy,TeaGuru,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"Well, that's kind of the point, you don't know that it won't be funded. Especially for projects under $10,000, they actually can turn around with just a few good days.  Cancelling the project costs momentum, and an active Kickstarter is by far the most effective free way to get people to look at your Kickstarter. If you're going to cancel, you could wait until the end to cancel, but the last day is usually the biggest, and could potentially close the gap. Here's my favorite Kicktraq example, even though the project had already funded: http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/996972475/disaster-looms/"

There are tons of projects that I know will never get funded 1-2 days after launch and many before. I am not and was not speaking about his project in regards to canceling just my feelings in general."
kickstarter,3dv0xy,TeaGuru,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:16:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I gave the advice I did.  Cancelling early shows that you recognize the problem, but it can also demonstrate a lack of commitment that makes people on Kickstarter nervous. It's infinitely better than abandoning a project, and if it's handled professionally it's a non-issue, but seeing your first project through, even if it fails, is a very different experience."
kickstarter,3dv0xy,wombatsanders,6,Mon Jul 20 14:02:30 2015 UTC,"IMO. there are no legit crowdfunding firms. Don't throw your 250.00 away Most PR firms will have very low impact on most businesses, same goes for crowdfunding.  There are many people that can help and a lot of free resources on how to run a successful campaign.   I launched with an 8k goal did 16k. Not luck, not a miracle and not a huge amount but a win for me that truly Kickstarted a full time business. Read this.   http://www.davesmeatandnuts.com/blogs/news/31641795-how-to-run-a-successful-crowdfunding-campaign  As wombatsanders said you can learn a bit, get some contacts and relaunch.   Read the blog post ...its all about the pre launch work.,...and here are a few notes on your project.   Why making overseas? Can you not find a US manufacturer? 3d printed? Made in USA will help for many reasons and at your price point it shouldn't be an issue.   Connect your facebook, it implies trust and honesty, we get to know who you are. Put your name on it, be proud.  Back other projects, even small amounts, support the community you want money from.   Have a 10.00 add on plaque, may a certificate of Authenticity. Something extra if people want.   Have a few more expensive versions, get them made locally.   Talk to a jeweler , find out how much it will take to make one out of solid gold, put it as a 10,000 reward or whatever cost is plus X. dont make it just offer it. This with your pre launch blog, social media and  press work may be a reason for someone to write, share or back.  Know a graphic designer have him make you a gold model and a jewl encrusted model also for 100,000k you never know what billionaire may have a sense of humor.   So thats 10,000 , 20/25, and 35 (plque or cert) and 45 (2 trophys) what about 100,200,500,1000,2000 (silver instead of gold ...i have no idea what it would cost but you get the idea) silver...carbon...titanium, etc....what about a larger  or full size version.. think out of the box and find cool things you can offer and not have made unless they are backed. Anything above X amount put a 90 day delivery date on A so you can have it made and B so people cant reverse a charge on a gold statue.    Id lay new audio down over the video you have. It is not great sounding, there are some filters out there. you could get a good voice over for 5.00 on fiver, maybe.   make sure shipping costs are factored in you will be at about 5.50 for small padded flat rate envelops.   Your Social game needs a lot of love. Look at instagress to help manage your instagram, cross post everything to FB and twitter when you post to instagram, Start following other people and X % will follow you back. Look for other joke gifts, fun ny stuff etc... Take one everywhere you go and engage people with it (pre launch if possible if you relaunch) get picks, hand out business cards with your social media, website (build one in shopify ASAP so you can start collecting emails  and have a banner link to the Kickstarter) . get people to allow you to take a pic or a quick video with them and always ask ""who would you give this to?""  Jenny H at the movies wants to send one to her boss. Mike B in blank park wants to give one to his dad etc.... This is real content.   Good luck, message me if i can help answer any questions.

The artwork is very interesting and that will draw (heh) people in but you still want to keep the people who don't get baked every day or at all even. I understand the style you were going for but your campaign feels... unprofessional. In that some people might not feel that you will not be able to follow through and ship the book out. For instance I was expecting the risks/challenges section to be taken more seriously since the rest was written in a fun way but instead the first sentence is about eating burritos. I'm by no means a crowdfunding expert, just viewing this as a potential backer and former 420 indulgent."

If you aren't already try and get this out as much as you can on social media. People love to tweet about stuff they buy. See if any pro-legalization groups or sites will share or write a little bit about the book. Cross promotion between projects is big on kickstarter so see if any other projects will feature you in an update and you can do the same for them. Maybe those Facebook coloring book groups you mention will share it? Good luck & I'll pledge $15 for you when I'm home tonight!"
kickstarter,3dvrms,Therealbradman,4,Sun Jul 19 23:00:52 2015 UTC,I checked out your KS and you have a good idea. I am all about supporting small time music.  You're probably failing because your rewards aren't very good.  $50 and I get a 30 second song written? Wow... so .. underwhelming.  $100 and I get a flash drive with the stuff that didn't make the cut for the final product.  $150 .. unless you're in the NYC area .. not worth it.  You really aren't offering anything.
kickstarter,3dvrms,electricsheep12345,0,Sun Jul 19 23:15:38 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. I just couldn't come up with anything better. A lot of the projects i looked at while doing research were about a specific product, so the rewards were easy - you get the final product! I put a lot of thought into trying to think of what i could give, and couldn't come up with anything good. If i could redo it all, i'd do photo session tiers from 5 minutes to a full day, and more stuff like that i think, which still doesn't help the geography issue...  And i don't understand how people give away T-Shirts so cheap. I couldn't find anywhere that would do a shirt for less than $20 a piece, and i see people all the time with shirts in their $25 reward. I couldn't figure that one out."
kickstarter,3dvrms,jkexxbxx,3,Sun Jul 19 23:46:10 2015 UTC,There are places out there you just have to look. TeeSpring allows custom shirts to be made fairly cheap around 7 to 10 bucks depending on the amount and design.
kickstarter,3dvrms,joneallen,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:04 2015 UTC,Yup! I use Jakprints all the time and their premium t-shirts (tri-blends) are under 10 bucks for a single color.
kickstarter,3dwqn9,KingSalt,6,Mon Jul 20 04:17:08 2015 UTC,"Ideas are nothing, execution is everything.  Work is the necessary ingredient to make an idea worth anything, the idea without the work is worthless.  The one who will succeed with the idea, therefore, is the one who goes and and does something with it.  The one who sits on their butt worrying about their idea being stolen might as well not have an idea, since nothing will come of it.  If it's really, really, really, really that wildly revolutionary that everybody else will want it, file a patent for it first.    Realistically, though, nobody is going to steal your idea.  The work to make a successful campaign is the valuable part, ideas are cheap and common, everybody has at least a few, and most people do nothing whatsoever with the ones they already have, they're not going to do anything with yours either."
kickstarter,3dt8bw,sneacon,8,Sun Jul 19 05:52:21 2015 UTC,"Looking at the update and the page... it mentions MDF in several places.  Yes, it's not solid wood, but looking at the case layout this is not something that is going to affect playback significantly, and their points could be very well true.  I'm no woodworker but wood is -not- a precision building material and veneer over MDF is arguably more difficult than just straight wood to produce and have a nice finish.  At a glance, it looks like the producer had a KS blow up on them, are scrambling to get everything together to actually produce 3300 of the item/ 25 times their original goal.  This isn't some company selling phantomware or promising something physically impossible.  It's a design change based on probability of defects and consistency in volume."
kickstarter,3dt8bw,wanderingbilby,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:13 2015 UTC,"I was a backer. I made a pledge for 2 (for me and my son) - but after I received the email, I cancelled. It looks great; however, $700 trumps aesthetics. Plus, I'm also having doubts if it really is ""audiophile"" as they claim. I'm also wondering what other cost-cutting measures (in the guise of better sound quality) they'll be making. Guess I'll have to make due with the Thorens I picked up for $5 at the Goodwill."
kickstarter,3dt8bw,finvarra,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:21:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a backer, but I would be upset if I pledged this and got an MDF version.  MDF is crap in my book.  I would be willing to bet it has nothing to do with quality and everything to do with MDF being quite a bit cheaper.  If it ever is exposed to a high humidity area or gets wet, it's going to turn to complete and utter crap.  Edit: Just noticed the project is still running.  That's a plus at least.

Kickstarter never emailed their customer base about our product, despite that fact that other media sites were calling our product revolutionary and trend setting.    Half the products on kickstarter are being hailed as revolutionary and trend setting on media sites.  If your plan relies on getting special treatment that fewer than 1% of projects receive, you're going to fail hard and deserve every second of your failure.   I don't have a particular opinion on IGG vs KS in general since I've never used IGG, but when IGG offered to feature him, he should've jumped. He had no reason to expect special treatment from KS."
